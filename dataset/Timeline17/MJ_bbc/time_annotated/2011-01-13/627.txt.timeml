<TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-01-12">12 January</TIMEX3> Hi there , I ' m
Leah from the BBC World News for Schools .
It 's <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-01-12">Wednesday</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2011-01">January</TIMEX3> the 12th .
<TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">One year</TIMEX3> on from the Haiti earthquake -- but a million people are still living in tents .
And Michael Jackson 's doctor is officially accused over his death .
But first -- there 's no let up in Australia as flood waters pour into one of its biggest cities , Brisbane .
People are fleeing to evacuation centres and tens of thousands of houses are expected to be under water when flood levels peak <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="TIME" value="2011-01-13TEV">this evening</TIMEX3> .
BBC reporter Nick Bryant is there : CLIP : ` ` The situation is going to get worse .
People are trying to sandbag their homes in the hope that they can try and block the waters .
But that 's a pretty forlorn hope .
I ' ve just been speaking to the local mayor here , he says that twenty thousand homes are either going to be totally or partially flooded . ''
There 's also been severe flooding in Sri Lanka .
Weeks of heavy rain have led to two - hundred thousand people losing their homes -- and the rain shows no sign of stopping .
Transporting water in Port - au - Prince , the capital of Haiti Next - it 's <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> since the devastating earthquake in Haiti which killed around two hundred and fifty thousand people .
<TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">Twelve months</TIMEX3> on a million people are still homeless and living in makeshift camps .
So far hardly any of the rubble from collapsed buildings has been cleared and poor hygiene in camps has led to diseases like cholera spreading , killing many more .
Haiti still faces many problems - with much of the money promised by foreign countries not yet received on the ground .
Our World News for Schools reporter spoke to Hannah Reichardt who works for the charity Save the Children and is in the capital city Port au Prince : CLIP : ` ` Save the Children is very concerned that all the money promised has n't yet made it to the people who need it on the ground in Haiti .
What we know is that something like half to sixty per cent of the money promised by the governments has n't yet made it here . ''
Before the earthquake hit , many people lived in very poor conditions - with only half of children going to school .
Hannah says the kids are a priority : CLIP : ` ` Children in Haiti have undergone more suffering in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010">the last year</TIMEX3> than most children in other countries will ever know in their lifetime .
They ' ve lost close friends and family , they ' ve seen children like them suffer from cholera and very threatening illnesses .
They ' ve had to undergo so much it will have a profound impact on their lives for ever .
But we also know that children if they 're given the right support can be highly resilient and they can bounce back .
But they need to be able to return to a normal childhood as quickly as possible . ''
Next -- there 's to be a trial over the death of pop singer Michael Jackson <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2009-07">eighteen months ago</TIMEX3> .
A judge in Los Angeles has ordered his personal doctor to face charges of being accidentally involved in his death -- and not giving the singer proper care .
Dr Conrad Murray says -- he 's not guilty .
Finally an Italian man has astonished doctors by sneezing a bullet out through his nose after being shot in the head .
Darco Sangermano was in hospital waiting for treatment when the bullet popped out of his right nostril .
He 's expected to make a full recovery .
And for <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2011-01-13">today</TIMEX3> 's question : how fast does the average sneeze travel ?
<TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2011-01-12">Yesterday</TIMEX3> we asked what two awards were joined to make the new FIFA world player award ?

And the answer is : French Football magazine 's and the old FIFA player of the year awards .
OK , that 's all from the World News for Schools team .
We 're back <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2011-01-14">tomorrow</TIMEX3> !
