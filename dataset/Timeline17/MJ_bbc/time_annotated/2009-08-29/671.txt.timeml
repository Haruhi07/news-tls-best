Propofol and the sedative Lorazepam were the ` ` primary drugs responsible for Mr Jackson 's death '' , but four further drugs were also found , the report said .

He has strenuously denied any wrongdoing .
` ` The cause of death was established as acute Propofol intoxication , '' a statement from the coroner said .

California 's attorney general will <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> open an independent investigation into several doctors whose names have come up in connection with Jackson 's death .
David Willis , BBC News , Los Angeles Michael Jackson had apparently been finding it difficult to sleep in the run - up to a series of comeback concerts in London .
It was Michael Jackson himself who persuaded the company that was promoting his comeback tour to hire Dr Murray , a cardiologist by training , on a salary of more than a $ 150,000 <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P1M">a month</TIMEX3> .
Dr Murray has acknowledged administering Propofol and Lorazepam on the day the singer died in an attempt to get him to sleep .
Dr Murray has denied any wrongdoing but it will <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> be up to the District Attorney to decide whether to lay charges in this case .
Dr Murray 's lawyer said the latest information ` ` contains nothing new '' and demanded that the coroner 's office release the full autopsy report .
Edward Chernoff said he needed to know the exact levels of the various drugs in Jackson 's system and said the refusal to release the report suggested ` ` gamesmanship '' .
` ` One has to wonder why the coroner felt compelled to release anything at all if the police investigation is not yet complete , '' he said .
Dr Murray told police he had been giving Jackson propofol as part of his treatment for insomnia , according to an affidavit made public on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2009-08-24">Monday</TIMEX3> .
The affidavit said Dr Murray had been giving Jackson propofol daily for <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P6W">six weeks</TIMEX3> but he was concerned that the singer was becoming addicted to the drug and had been trying to wean him off , using alternative drugs .
Dr Murray told investigators he was not the first doctor to administer propofol to the star .
On the morning of the singer 's death , Dr Murray is reported to have given Jackson a lower dosage of propofol - on the singer 's insistence - after a number of other drugs had not worked .
Conrad Murray insists he has done nothing wrong The last time Dr Murray administered the medication was <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="1040">1040</TIMEX3> on <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2009-06-25">25 June</TIMEX3> , just hours before Jackson 's heart stopped .
Dr Murray is known to have performed CPR on his patient while paramedics were called , but Jackson was declared dead when he arrived at hospital .
Police and federal agents have raided Dr Murray 's offices in Las Vegas , Nevada , and Houston , Texas , and a Las Vegas pharmacy that provided the drugs .
Jackson 's family welcomed the coroner 's findings .
` ` The Jackson family again wishes to commend the actions of the coroner , the LAPD and other law enforcement agencies , and looks forward to the day that justice can be served , '' the family said in a statement .
The singer will be buried on <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2009-08-27">Thursday</TIMEX3> at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale , a suburb of Los Angeles , in a private ceremony .
The burial was initially scheduled to take place on <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2009-08-29">Saturday</TIMEX3> - on what would have been Jackson 's 51st birthday .
