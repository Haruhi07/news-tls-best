Jackson suffered a cardiac arrest in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2009-06">June</TIMEX3> Michael Jackson 's death certificate has been amended to reflect his cause of death as homicide .
The document has been changed to specify that his death was caused by ` ` injection by another '' .
Investigators had concluded that a powerful concoction of prescription drugs killed the pop star .
The coroner 's further homicide verdict increases the chances of criminal charges being brought against Jackson 's doctors .
Jackson died at his Los Angeles home in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2009-06">June</TIMEX3> , aged 50 .
Police have interviewed his personal physician Dr Conrad Murray but he has not been named as a suspect .
He has strenuously denied any wrongdoing .
Jackson is expected to be buried in a private sunset ceremony in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in California .
Only close family and friends of Jackson will be in attendance for the event .
Meanwhile , a hoax video apparently showing the singer emerging from a coroner 's van has emerged .
German channel RTL posted the footage on YouTube and received 880,000 hits in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P1D">one day</TIMEX3> .
Heike Schultz , spokeswoman for the network , said it had been an experiment .
` ` We wanted to show how easily users can be manipulated on the internet with hoax videos , '' she said .
` ` Therefore , we created this video of Michael Jackson being alive , even though everybody knows by <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> that he is dead - and the response was breathtaking . ''
