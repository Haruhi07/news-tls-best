The Black Eyed Peas have joined the line - up of the Michael Jackson tribute concert in Cardiff .
Promoters said the US group will perform at the Michael Forever tribute on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2011-10-08">8 October</TIMEX3> .
Other stars booked to appear are Christina Aguilera and Cee Lo Green .
Michael Jackson 's eldest brother Jermaine Jackson is opposed to the concert as it clashes with the trial of Conrad Murray , who is accused of involuntary manslaughter .
Prosecutors claim Conrad Murray caused the pop star 's death by giving him a powerful anesthetic , propofol , to help him sleep .
Dr Murray has pleaded not guilty to the charges .
Lawyers for the doctor say the star was drunk and unconscious just before a press conference in London to announce his comeback gigs at the O2 .
They wanted to show the video to jurors when Dr Conrad Murray goes on trial in California <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2011-W39">this week</TIMEX3> but the judge says it is not relevant .
A jury of seven men and five women has been selected from a panel of nearly 400 people .
