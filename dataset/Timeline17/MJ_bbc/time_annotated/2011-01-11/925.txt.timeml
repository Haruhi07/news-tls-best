Dr Murray , 57 , has pleaded not guilty , and says he did not give Jackson anything potentially lethal .
Judge Pastor made the order against the cardiologist on the sixth day of the hearing .
He also granted a request by the California Medical Board to suspend the licence of Dr Murray to practice in the state .
Dr Murray faces <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P4Y" mod="EQUAL_OR_LESS">up to four years</TIMEX3> in prison if convicted at trial .

Mr Martinez told the hearing Dr Murray said that Jackson told him on the day he died he would have to cancel his comeback concerts in London unless he had a dose of the anesthetic , propofol .
Michael Jackson was rehearsing for a series of concerts in London when he died The detective said Dr Murray admitted giving Jackson it after a night administering lesser drugs to help him sleep .
The doctor said he then left the room for ` ` <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="PT2M">two minutes</TIMEX3> '' to go to the bathroom , but on returning found the singer had stopped breathing , Mr Martinez said .
Dr Murray started to try to resuscitate Mr Jackson but told the detective he did not call for an ambulance himself because ` ` he said he was caring for his patient and he did not want to neglect him '' .
Prosecutors say that phone records show the doctor made a series of other calls before an ambulance was finally called <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="PT1H">more than an hour</TIMEX3> later .
Mr Martinez also said Dr Murray told him he had given Mr Jackson doses of propofol six nights <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="P1W">a week</TIMEX3> for <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P2M">two months</TIMEX3> but was trying to wean him off the drug as he feared his patient was becoming addicted .
During closing arguments at the hearing , Dr Murray 's lawyer , Joseph Low , said the case should be dismissed because prosecutors had not adequately proved how Dr Murray caused Jackson 's death .
He also said Jackson 's health may have been a contributing cause .
