The UK firm that insured Michael Jackson 's comeback gigs at London 's O2 arena has asked a judge in Los Angeles to nullify the $ 17.5 m -LRB- # 10.7 m -RRB- policy .
Insurer Lloyd 's of London is suing promoter AEG Live saying it failed to supply details including apparent ` ` prescription drug use and\/or addiction '' .
AEG took out the cancellation and non - appearance policy - with cover of up to $ 17.5 m - <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P2M">two months</TIMEX3> before Jackson 's <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2009-06">June 2009</TIMEX3> death , court papers suggest .
AEG Live was not available for comment .
Lloyd 's said a lawyer for AEG Live submitted a claim , along with Jackson 's death certificate , within days of the singer 's death .
It said that , when AEG Live took out the policy - in which the singer was given the alias Mark Jones - it should have given full information about his medical history .
The insurer said a required medical examination was never carried out .
It also claimed it had sought information from the promoter about Jackson 's personal doctor , Conrad Murray , since <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2009-12">December 2009</TIMEX3> .
AEG had failed to provide that information , Lloyd 's said .
For all these reasons , Lloyd 's said it was not obliged to pay for the cost of canceling the shows - one of the biggest debts faced by the singer 's estate following his death .
Dr Murray , who had been treating Jackson for insomnia , has pleaded not guilty to a charge of involuntary manslaughter over the singer 's death .
Prosecutors say he gave Jackson a lethal dose of a powerful anesthetic and then failed to provide proper care .
Lawyers for Dr Murray , who will appear in court <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2011" mod="END">later this year</TIMEX3> , have suggested in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent months</TIMEX3> that the singer gave himself the dose of anesthetic .
The pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ?
