Fairs mentions a couple of dwellings related to the turnpike which may possibly be candidates for the house Neil refers to as being mentioned in the <TIMEX3 tid="t272" type="DATE" value="1881">1881</TIMEX3> Census .
In Hay ` ` the toll house was at Dishpool Lane -LRB- <TIMEX3 tid="t276" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> Forest Road -RRB- on the junction of that and the Brecon Road , close to the Manor Pound -LRB- formerly on the SE of the corner , but this stone - walled enclosure has disappeared with the construction of houses on the adjacent fields -RRB- .
Fairs goes on to remark that this toll house was eventually bought by the Council in <TIMEX3 tid="t277" type="DATE" value="1895">1895</TIMEX3> and demolished .
Fairs mentions two other possibilities : -LRB- 1 -RRB- the Black Lion Toll House which ` ` still exists just beyond the bridge over the Dulas brook and was locally known as the Nantyglasdwr -LRB- anglice Nantyglaster -RRB- gate '' ; and -LRB- 2 -RRB- the Cooper 's Hall gate -LRB- on the Whitney road -RRB- that ` ` was moved about a mile westward -LRB-
Fairs must surely mean ` ` north - eastward '' -RRB- to Pontvaen in <TIMEX3 tid="t278" type="DATE" value="1867">1867</TIMEX3> .
Both toll houses are <TIMEX3 tid="t279" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> dwelling houses '' -LRB-
pp.79 - 80 -RRB- .
Notice , of course , that the words ` ` Turnpike House '' are not used by Fairs , but it is just possible that the <TIMEX3 tid="t280" type="DATE" value="1881">1881</TIMEX3> Census did refer to one of these toll - houses in that fashion . ''

The age for John is correct as is the place of residence .

Angela : ` ` I ' m researching my Ancestors from mid Wales , my 2 x Great Grandmother was Catherine Micah b c1847 in Machynlleth .

They married in South Wales in the Pontypridd registration district and had my Great Grandfather Albert John Evans in <TIMEX3 tid="t1056" type="DATE" value="1887">1887</TIMEX3> .
I know nothing more of Evan 's family -LRB-

but Catherine 's parents were John & Catherine Micah and John was a Tailor and had a shop in Pentre Rhedyn St in Machynlleth .
His parents were Thomas & Ann and Thomas was also a tailor .

David Jones from Pecatonica , Illinois USA has unearthed information about people from the Tregaron area settling in Wisconsin .
David : ` ` In doing my genealogical research of two towns in Southwestern Wisconsin settled by Welsh emigrants in the <TIMEX3 tid="t1131" type="DATE" value="1840">1840</TIMEX3> - <TIMEX3 tid="t1132" type="DATE" value="1850">1850</TIMEX3> period , I have discovered that many of them originated from an area around the Cors Caron bog .
The movement from Wales , GB to Wales , WI and Genesee , WI was started by one person , Richard ` ` King '' Jones , who bought some 5000 acres at $ 1.25 per acre , and arranged for several hundred families to come to Wisconsin , where they purchased plots of land from him , ranging from 40 to 200 acres .
My own ancestor , John M Jones , lived on a small plot on a hill overlooking the Southeast part of the bog .
It is a mile or so from Tregaron .
There is a raised ring there where an early structure once stood .
The farm is <TIMEX3 tid="t1133" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> called Lwyn - Gwinau , and the Victorian Ordnance Map shows the former earthen structure listed as Castel Lwyn - Gwinau .
John M Jones left the Tregaron area in <TIMEX3 tid="t1134" type="DATE" value="1847">1847</TIMEX3> with his family and moved to Southeastern Wisconsin , where the native Indians numbered 100 for every white man , according to his grandson , my grandfather .
Welsh was spoken in these Wisconsin towns well into the <TIMEX3 tid="t1135" type="DATE" value="1930">1930</TIMEX3> 's .
The towns are about 20 miles west of Milwaukee .
One can find more on the individual Welsh emigrants to this area in Wisconsin by searching Google for my treatise , ` ` The Welsh Pioneers of Waukesha County , Wisconsin '' .
If someone in your family left Wales for Wisconsin during that time period , I would be interested in their names . ''

Rowena : '' Your Gt Grandfather had a sister called Mary Ann Elizabeth Stephens born <TIMEX3 tid="t1200" type="DATE" value="1850-01-02">2 Jan 1850</TIMEX3> , Redgates Cottage , Berriew - she was my great grandmother .
So I guess we are related .
I have also had trouble tracking down this family & sent off for her brother 's birth certificate as a last resort -1 was so surprised when I did a Google search which came up with your query !
I do remember my grandmother talking about her Aunt Matilda as she had a few photos of her with possibly her daughters , one of whom Edith Mary died aged 26 , & I knew the surviving sister Elizabeth Jane married Frederick Meredith & moved to the Lichfield area .
What I do know from what my grandmother told me & from all the research that my sisters & I have done is that Gt Gt Grandad Richard Stephens was born in Llanllwchaiarn abt <TIMEX3 tid="t1203" type="DATE" value="1818">1818</TIMEX3> & he died on <TIMEX3 tid="t1205" type="DATE" value="1885-09-23">23 Sept 1885</TIMEX3> , -LRB- his father was also called Richard .
-RRB-
On <TIMEX3 tid="t1211" type="DATE" value="1842-01-23">23 Jan 1842</TIMEX3> he married Mary Mantle in Aberhafesp Church -LRB- by Banns
-RRB- she was born <TIMEX3 tid="t1209" type="DATE" value="1808">1808</TIMEX3> , Llandinam died <TIMEX3 tid="t1212" type="DATE" value="1890-01-26">26 Jan 1890</TIMEX3> , Berriew .
Her father was called Thomas Mantle born circa <TIMEX3 tid="t1217" type="DATE" value="1776">1776</TIMEX3> , Llanbadarn , Radnorshire .
I have come up against a brick wall trying to trace her mother or any of this family .
Gt Gt Grandad was a Gamekeeper on the Glansevem Estate , although earlier info shows him as a labourer , & they lived in Redgates Cottage , Berriew .
My Great grandmother Mary Ann Elizaneth Stephens married James Threadgold , also a Gamekeeper at Glansevern & they lived at Stone House Garthmyl , Berriew .
They had 9 children , 5 of them died from consumption etc & they are buried in the cemetery at Berriew .
3 sisters & 1 brother survived .
Matilda is also buried there & her father John Ewing is buried in the next grave as he was living with her later on in life .
It is difficult to trace the Ewings as most of the Irish records were destroyed in the fire but we do know that John married a Welsh girl from Newtown called Elizabeth .
I am also intrigued by the fact that Richard Junior 's father is shown as Edward but <TIMEX3 tid="t1218" type="DATE" value="2010-06-29">today</TIMEX3> I obtained a copy of his marriage cert from the local office at Newrown & on that he is shown as Richard .
I did wonder whether he may have been called Edward Richard . ''

Elizabeth 's father John was born in Welshpool , and was the son of an innkeeper who was originally from Shropshire .

He always said he was from a small town between Aberystwyth and ` Abersoken ' called ` Abertibi . '

Is ` Abertibi ' Aberteifi ?
What is the correct version of ` Abersoken ? '

He is listed as an Agr .
laborer on the <TIMEX3 tid="t1785" type="DATE" value="1871">1871</TIMEX3> Wales census report , age 30 .
His year of birth was <TIMEX3 tid="t1786" type="DATE" value="1842">1842</TIMEX3> according to that census .
He died , however , before <TIMEX3 tid="t1787" type="DATE" value="1881">1881</TIMEX3> when his wife Eleanor was listed as a widow .
I do believe that the <TIMEX3 tid="t1788" type="DATE" value="1835">1835</TIMEX3> birth year is correct and that he died in <TIMEX3 tid="t1789" type="DATE" value="1879">1879</TIMEX3> at the age of 43 .

take a look at history.powys.org .
html for more information about Van . ''
After reading Rachael 's suggestion , Margery Hallesey got back to us with further information : ` ` I know that he was not involved in the lead mining at Van , as he inherited the farm Pen - y - Banc , Llanidloes from his father .
He then sold it to his brothers who farmed it for a while before selling it to the Jarman family .
The farm is <TIMEX3 tid="t1797" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> owned by Lord Hooson , married to Shirley -LRB- nee Hamer -RRB- who is my cousin .
So the farm is still in the family one way or another . ''
Rachael Jones suggested another possible reason for why Margery 's great grandfather may have left the Llanidloes area : ` ` In that case , perhaps Mary Ann 's father decided to move away because of the Chartist troubles .
The date is right see history.powys.org .
