Detective Orlando Martinez was one of the first defense witnesses called Lawyers defending Conrad Murray , Michael Jackson 's doctor , have called their first witnesses .
They will have to counter <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DURATION" value="P4W">four weeks</TIMEX3> of testimony from prosecution witnesses , who alleged that Dr Murray acted unethically and with gross negligence Dr Murray is charged with involuntary manslaughter in a Los Angeles court .
Among the first witnesses were a doctor and a nurse practitioner , who had both previously treated or counselled Jackson .
Dr Allan Metzger , a friend of Jackson 's for <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P2DE" mod="MORE_THAN">over two decades</TIMEX3> , testified that Jackson had requested anaesthetics from him as a sleep aid .
During their cross - examination , prosecutors used the same testimony to show that other medical professionals rejected using intravenous or oral anaesthetics to help Jackson sleep .
Cherilyn Lee , a holistic nurse practitioner who treated Jackson with vitamin infusions , testified that she urged Jackson to undergo a sleep study for his insomnia , but he refused , saying he did n't have enough time .
Ms Lee , who has spoken publicly about Jackson requesting propofol from her , is expected to tell jurors about further exchanges with the late singer when she continues testifying on <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2011-10-18">Tuesday</TIMEX3> .
The defense also questioned Detectives Dan Myers and Orlando Martinez about testimony from bodyguard Alberto Alvarez .
Mr Alvarez said that after Jackson 's breathing stopped , Dr Murray told him to place equipment and vials into a bag before calling the 911 emergency service .
The defense has contended that Mr Alvarez may have changed his story after a coroner 's official report was released .
Dr Murray is not expected to testify , but the defense has said they will call their own propofol expert to counter testimony of anaesthesiologist Steven Shafer , the prosecution witness who testified for <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P5D">five days</TIMEX3> .
Defense lawyers argued in opening statements that Jackson could have drunk an extra dose of propofol , but later told the court they would drop the argument based on their own studies .
Prosecutors have portrayed Dr Murray as grossly negligent for administering the drug outside of a hospital setting .
The defense has argued that he was trying to wean a troubled Jackson off the drug , and that the pop superstar , desperate for sleep during rehearsals for a planned comeback concert , administered the fatal dose himself .
Correspondents say that with multiple witnesses already called on <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2011-10-24">Monday</TIMEX3> , the case could go to the jury as early as <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2011-W43" mod="END">the end of this week</TIMEX3> .
The pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ?
