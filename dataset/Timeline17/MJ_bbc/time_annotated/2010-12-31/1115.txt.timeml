Michael Jackson died in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2009-06">June 2009</TIMEX3> aged 50 Executors for the late star 's estate had requested the program - entitled Michael Jackson 's Autopsy : What Really Killed Michael Jackson - be canceled .
John Branca and John McClain had said the show was ` ` in shockingly bad taste '' .
Discovery said an forthcoming court hearing was also a factor .
` ` Given the commencement of legal proceedings beginning <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-W01">next week</TIMEX3> , and at the request of Michael Jackson 's estate , the scheduled broadcast of the medical documentary related to Michael Jackson 's official autopsy has been postponed indefinitely , '' Discovery Networks International said in a statement .
Mr Branca and Mr McClain said they were pleased with the network 's decision .
In a letter previously sent to Discovery , the pair had accused the company of being motivated by ` ` blind desire '' to exploit the singer 's death .
` ` Your decision to even schedule this program is in shockingly bad taste and insensitive to Michael 's family , '' the co - executors wrote .
The program was scheduled to be aired in Europe on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010-01-13">13 January</TIMEX3> .
An advertisement used to promote the show reportedly depicted a body covered by a sheet with one hand wearing the singer 's trademark sequined glove visible .
A preliminary hearing is scheduled to begin on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-01-04">4 January</TIMEX3> where it will be decided if there is sufficient evidence to try Jackson 's physician , Dr Conrad Murray , on involuntary manslaughter charges .
Dr Murray has repeatedly denied causing Jackson 's death .
The singer died suddenly in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2009-06">June of 2009</TIMEX3> from a prescription drug overdose at age 50 , weeks before beginning a set of concerts .
The pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ?
