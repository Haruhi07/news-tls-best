'' \nThe show was expected to have sold out . \nChart-toppers Black Eyed Peas withdrew from the line-up of the Michael Forever concert last week . \nMr King told BBC Radio Wales that losing the group from the bill had allowed the show to be `` tightened up '' , and extra songs allocated to some of the `` major artists '' involved . \nThe pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ? \n"}

{"id": "1179", "time": "2011-07-26", "text": "The announcement of a Michael Jackson tribute concert in Cardiff in October . \nTwo of Michael Jackson 's brothers have criticised a planned tribute concert to the pop superstar in Cardiff as `` inappropriate '' and `` ill-timed '' . \nJermaine and Randy Jackson are unhappy that it will clash with the trial of Conrad Murray , the doctor charged in relation to their brother 's death . \nThe 8 October gig at the Millennium Stadium was announced by producers Global Live Events on Monday . \nBut the event has won the backing of the late singer 's mother Katherine . \nJackson died in June 2009 aged 50 while rehearsing for his This Is It tour . \nWhen plans for the concert were announced it was reported that Mrs Jackson , and the singer 's sister La Toya and brothers Tito , Marlon and Jackie , were in support of it . \nAt a press conference Mrs Jackson said : `` Michael gave his entire life to the world through his love , his music and his devotion to healing the planet . '' \nShe said she was positive that the event would `` form a worthy celebration of Michael 's life . '' \nJermaine and Randy Jackson said there would come a time and place for such a tribute She revealed that `` as many members of my family that are available '' would attend the event . \nHowever following the press conference the two brothers released a statement saying that while they supported `` the spirit '' of a tribute concert , in choosing the timing of it the promoter had `` disrespected '' their opinions and wishes . \n`` In light of this , we feel it is inappropriate to be involved with such an ill-timed event and its promoter , Global Live , '' the statement said . \nNo acts have been announced for the concert yet but a notice on the event 's website promises `` the world 's greatest performing artists '' will appear . \nSTATEMENT BY JERMAINE AND RANDY JACKSON `` Today 's press conference in Los Angeles announced a tribute concert to Michael to be attended and supported by the Jackson family . \n`` However , we want to make clear that this does not reflect the position of the entire family . \n`` While we wholeheartedly support the spirit of a tribute that honors our brother , we find it impossible to support an event that is due to take place during the criminal trial surrounding Michael 's death . \n`` As everyone knows , those proceedings commence September 20th , and this Michael Forever concert takes place in Cardiff , Wales , on 8 October . \n`` In light of this , we feel it is inappropriate to be involved with such an ill-timed event and its promoter , Global Live . \n`` Furthermore , the decision to proceed with this concert disrespects opinions and wishes expressed in the strongest terms to Global Live during conversations in April when this event was presented to the majority of the family as an idea already in its advanced stages . \n`` There will come a time and place for an amazing and deserving tribute to Michael . \nBut we feel that the most important tribute we can give to our brother at this time is to seek justice in his name . '' \nThere are plans for the concert to be broadcast around the world to 30 countries in 2D and 3D . \nIt will raise money for three charities including the Los Angeles-based Aids Project . \nAnnouncing the concert on Monday , Roger Lewis , group chief executive of the Welsh Rugby Union , which owns and operates the stadium , said the `` extra special '' concert would pay tribute to one of the world 's greatest pop icons of all time and benefit US and UK charities . \nHe added it was `` fantastic news for music fans all over the world '' and that it would be `` a huge boost for Wales to host this spectacular one-off show . '' \nGlobal Live Events LLP has worked with a range of artists including Abba , The Beatles , Eric Clapton , Madonna , Placido Domingo , and Jackson himself . \nWhen the concert was revealed Chris Hunt , the firm 's president , said : `` We wanted to do something decent and worthy of Michael 's musical genius yet something fun and authentic that you would envision Michael attending with excitement and joy surrounded by talent that he respected and loved . '' \nMeanwhile , a Los Angeles judge has ruled that footage of Jackson rehearsing for a concert just days before his death will not be show in court . \nProsecutors wanted to show several hours of unedited tapes filmed for the movie This Is It in an effort to prove Jackson was healthy before he died of a drug overdose in 2009 . \nThe footage was not actually included in the movie , which was released four months after the singer 's death in 2009 . \nSony Pictures , the studio behind the film , argued that showing the unseen footage in a public court may hurt its potential commercial value . \nSony Pictures said it screened more than 100 hours of raw footage for the lawyers and the judge in the case . \nJudge Michael Pastor concluded on Monday that it would not help the defense and that `` it was a waste of my time . '' \nBut the jury will be shown clips that were used in the film which show the star rehearsing for a series of comeback concerts in London . \n12th August 2011 - 23:07 This comment was removed because the moderators found it broke the house rules . \nThe pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ? \n"}

American south , documenting its unique personalities and music , writer and musician Banning Eyre embarks on his own Appalachian road trip to discover the American folk music that was born there in the 18th and 19th centuries . \nHe visits the small town of Mount Airy in Surry County , North Carolina , where he meets the extraordinary players and singers keeping this music alive , and finds out how `` old time '' music is the direct precursor of what is now called country and bluegrass . \nIn an interview with musician and field recordist Mike Seeger , recorded just a few months before he died , Banning discovers the roots of the music in the parallel histories of the European settlers and African slaves . \nHe finds out how , post-emancipation , a distinctly American music was forged from the interplay of the African banjo and the European fiddle . \nBanning then embarks on a cross-state journey to hear the music and the stories of some of the older players and singers who can trace a direct line back to before the age of the radio and gramophone , to when this music was a strictly oral tradition . \nBanning meets 90-year-old fiddler Jo Thomson -- perhaps the only known surviving old time , African-American stringband player . \nHis playing and stories capture a period of time before the music was delineated on race grounds . \nBanning also meets eighth-generation

for a new role as liberator of Flanders . \nThe title role is taken by one of today 's most admired tenors , Jonas Kaufmann , with soprano Marina Poplavskaya as Elizabeth of Valois and Ferruccio Furlanetto as Philip II of Spain . \nAround this tragic central triangle is a wider confrontation between authoritarian religion , represented by John Tomlinson 's Grand Inquisitor , and political liberation , represented by Carlo 's closest friend , the Marquis of Posa , sung by Simon Keenlyside . \nSaturday Play -- Emil And The Detectives The cast of Emil And The Detectives , Joshua Swinney

this two-part documentary Tim Gardam , Principal of St Anne 's College , Oxford , confronts the response to death in 21st-century Britain . \nHe reflects on how people deal with death as a society and considers the relationship between those who have gone and those who are left behind . \nMost people can remember their first funeral . \nEveryone can remember the first time they saw someone who had died . \nBut how we respond to death and our own mortality varies greatly in multi-cultural Britain . \nIn the first program , Tim meets two teenagers who created their own ritual for their friend Dan , who died suddenly in a road accident . \nHe hears from a 70-year-old Hindu who is challenging British law in order to secure the right to have an open funeral pyre in the UK when he dies . \nAnd Tim encounters death first-hand when he joins with a Muslim family at their ritual washing and burial of their father\\/grandfather which traditionally takes place within 24 hours of death . \nIn the second program he finds out that people often go far beyond a lock of hair or piece of jewellery as a keepsake of a loved one . \nTim attends the National Funeral Exhibition and encounters an industry where physical immortality is now marketed as a desirable commodity to those who have lost their belief in life after death , but who are terrified of oblivion . \nHe finds out that human , or indeed animal , ashes are now made into diamonds , paperweights and wind chimes . \nRunaway Train is the remarkable story of railwayman Wesley McDonald who was recorded on his train as it hurtled down a mountain . \nThe 20-minute recording reveals the radio conversation Wesley had with his line manager as he tried to make the terrible decision of whether he should jump from the train or take his chances and hang on . \nBut the longer he vacillates , the faster the train is speeding down the mountain track , and the fewer his chances of survival . \nWesley found himself stuck on his train hurtling down a mountainside from a mine in New Brunswick , Canada , in 1987 . \nHe decided not to jump and the train derailed at about 70mph . \nThe recording captures the moment when he was found by his colleagues , miraculously unscathed . \nJohn Hurt narrates this two-part adaptation of EM Forster 's classic , Howards End . \nWhen the headstrong and impetuous Helen Schlegel sends a telegram to her sister announcing she has fallen in love with Paul Wilcox , she sparks a collision between two very different families : The Schlegels are intellectual , sensitive to the arts , idealistic and compassionate . \nThe Wilcox family , by contrast , are materialistic , practical , unimaginative and very rich . \nThe short-lived romance comes to an end but Helen 's elder sister Margaret forms an uncomfortable but genuine bond with Mrs Wilcox , who is ill and dies . \nThe late Mrs Wilcox had scribbled a last request that her beloved house , Howards End , be left to Margaret Wilcox . \nThe family , however , has disregarded and destroyed this note . \nHowards End is a timeless story concerned with relationships and the possibility of reconciliation between pairs of opposites : the prose and the passion , the practical mind and the intellect , the outer life and the inner . \nThis radio adaptation by Amanda Dalton stars Lisa Dillon as Margaret Schlegel ; Jill Cardo as Helen Schlegel ; Tom Ferguson as Tibby Shlegel ; Malcolm Raeburn as Henry Wilcox ; Ann Rye as Ruth Wilcox ; and Joseph Kloska as Charles Wilcox . \n12.00noon-5 .00 pm BBC RADIO 5 LIVE Colin Murray presents an

, working for drummer\\/band-leader Ben Pollack and concludes in 1928 with Goodman about to leave Chicago , heading for New York . \nKirill Karabits conducts the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra in a concert recorded at the Lighthouse , Poole , earlier this year . \nDebussy 's heady portrait of a sultry sun-infused afternoon of a faun is considered one of the key works of musical history , as tonality loosens its grip among the mythical glades of nymphs , naiads and fauns . \nStravinsky 's The Rite Of Spring is also a seminal work and Debussy -- who premired the four-hand piano version with the composer -- was a great admirer of the younger man 's piece , admitting that the Rite haunted him `` like a beautiful nightmare '' . \nRachmaninov 's Piano Concert No. 2 -- made famous by its use in the soundtrack to Brief Encounter -- is performed by Russian pianist Vadim Rudenko . \nIt was composed in 1900 after a period of severe writer 's block , which was only overcome after

Friday 23 October Clive James reads from his fifth volume of memoirs -- The TV Years -- in this new Book Of The Week offering , which covers his most prominent period on TV . \nFor many people , Clive James will always be a TV presenter first and foremost , and a writer second , despite the fact that his adventures with the written word took place before , during and after his time on the small screen . \nNevertheless , for those who remember clips of Japanese endurance game shows and Egyptian soap operas ; Clive reinventing the news or interviewing Hefner and Hepburn , Polanski and Pavarotti ; Clive 's `` Postcards '' from Kenya , Shanghai and Dallas ; or Clive James Racing Driver , Clive 's rightful place does seem to be on the box . \nMonday 19 to Friday 23 October The Dead Hour , a new , 10-part dramatisation by Chris Dolan from a novel by Denise Mina , is set in Glasgow in 1984 , and forms this new Woman 's Hour Drama offering . \nIn the middle of the night , plucky

\nWhen the police are called to a domestic disturbance at an imposing detached house in the exclusive conservation district of Bearsden , Paddy is quick to follow them up the secluded garden path . \nVhari Burnett is a top lawyer , but that has n't stopped her from being beaten up , or so it seems . \nWhen her partner opens the door he claims there has been a misunderstanding . \nThe next day , Vhari is found dead . \nDriven by her nose for a story and wracked by guilt at her own apparent complicity , Paddy 's investigations reveal two middle-class sisters caught up in a world of violence , drug-dealing and East End gangs . \nAs the story spirals , Paddy herself faces increasing danger . \nThe cast is to be confirmed closer to transmission . \nShari Vahl meets some of the trainees on the National Graduate Development Programme , set up to encourage bright graduates to do a job they might not previously have considered -- working for the council -- in a new , three-part series .

secretary at the Ministry of Justice . \nFilthy Rich , written by Micheal Butt , forms today 's Afternoon Play offering . \nFor the last five years , since his father 's death , Max has known that on his 30th birthday he would receive a small fortune . \nBut the time he 's had to wait has come at a price -- in order to claim his inheritance he 's had to prove to his grandmother that he 's capable of `` getting on '' with his sister . \nNormally this would n't be the most taxing of trials , but Max and sister Katrin have rarely seen eye to eye . \nEver since he broke the neck of her parrot when they were children , they 've gone from spat to spat . \nHowever , for the last five years , Max has somehow managed to keep himself in check . \nNow , with only two weeks to go until judgement day ,

to transmission . \nMonday 19 to Friday 23 October Award-winning historian Professor Amanda Vickery continues to present a history of private life in Britain over 400 years , and this week focuses on the 18th century -- exploring servants , bachelors , spinsters , widows and widowers . \nMany servants did n't have a bed of their own and slept in passageways or across their masters ' doors -- like guard dogs . \nMaids , meanwhile , were notoriously vulnerable to sexually predatory men . \nIn Tuesday 's program , Professor Vickery explores the life of a bachelor in the 17th and 18th centuries . \nLiving outside the family embrace was far from glamorous before the advent of washing machines , microwaves and pre-prepared meals for one . \nBachelorhood was supposed to be a temporary and unprestigious state best solved by marriage . \nThis program tells the poignant and amusing story of law student Dudley Ryder , and his search for a wife . \nWednesday 's program explores the lives of spinsters and reveals that one in five women never married . \nThursday 's program , meanwhile , shows that the lives of widows were very different from spinsters . \nWidows had enormous status and power and , for some , the death of a spouse was a fairy-tale release . \nThis program tells the story of one of England 's richest widows and how she spent her fortune . \nThe final program of the week tells the story of two different widowers and their search for a new wife . \nThis is original material from two unusual sets of diaries which Professor Vickery found in Lincoln . \nOne widower was a surgeon , while the other a solicitor -- a man tortured by guilt because of his relationship with his housekeeper , who he is unable to stop sleeping with . \nPresenter\\/Professor Amanda

the original dilemma to living with the consequences . \nIn this week 's edition of The Choice , Michael talks to Father Aidan Troy , the Catholic priest who played a central role in supporting the pupils of Holy Cross School , Belfast , during protests over their right to walk to school in 2001 . \nAntony Gormley , one of Britain 's leading artists , pays tribute to the sculptor Jacob Epstein on the 50th anniversary of his death . \nEpstein attracted criticism during his career , his work was often seen as being too graphic or hard hitting , too ugly or cannibal . \nAfter his death , fellow sculptor , Henry Moore paid tribute to his courage as a pioneering artist who bore the brunt of critical derision . \nFifty years on , Anthony shows how Epstein revived British sculpture in crucial ways : how he sought inspiration from the ancient , non-Western cultures of Egypt , China and Africa , and how he insisted on `` direct carving '' , where he worked out his ideas straight into the stone . \nBorn on the East Side of New York City in 1880 to Jewish immigrant parents , Jacob Epstein moved to Paris in 1902 , where he absorbed the work of Rodin and saw ancient Egyptian sculpture in the Louvre . \nHe moved to London in 1905 , immediately feeling at home and becoming a British subject . \nHis first significant commission came in 1907 , when he carved 18 figures for the British Medical Association Building in the Strand . \nCompleted the following year , these pieces solidly established the young sculptor 's reputation -- he had numerous private commissions for portraits throughout his career . \nAt this time , Epstein 's passion for direct carving in his own work becomes evident and his subject matter is devoted to major human themes and a search for the primordial , archetypal image . \nFrom modest beginnings in Paris , his keen interest in African sculpture grew and he amassed one of the finest collections of African art in Britain . \nWriter Irma Kurtz sets off on a journey to Paris and Madrid to investigate the period just before the war when blind Spanish composer Joaquin Rodrigo composed his famous Concerto de Aranjuez . \nThe concerto , one of the most famous pieces of classical music , was written 70 years ago . \nAlthough Rodrigo could n't play the instrument , Spain 's guitar traditions and rhythms are ever present in the music . \nMany people particularly love the middle movement , `` Adagio '' . \nRodrigo said he wanted to evoke `` the fragrance of magnolias '' , `` the song of birds and the gushing of fountains '' . \nIrma analyses how place and time affected the composition and also offers a psychological analysis of the composer 's life in pre-wartime Paris and Madrid and how his make-up can be heard in his music . \nIrma , who has lived in both Spain and Paris , has long had a fascination for Rodrigo 's music . \nShe travels to Paris and Madrid to talk to Rodrigo 's family , including his daughter Cecilia Rodrigo , the eminent guitarist Pepe Romero and Henri Heugel of the Ecole Normale de Musique in Paris , where Rodrigo studied . \nIrma also visits the family home in Madrid and the gardens at Aranjuez . \nIrma 's

Joint Intelligence Group at Guantanamo , maintains that no mistake was made , and Sami was legitimately taken and held . \nDavid Rivkin , a Washington lawyer who served in the White House Counsel 's

on agriculture , has been widely reported . \nLess well known is the serious decline of the bumblebee , whose role is just as important in pollinating many crops and flowers that honeybees do n't touch . \nThis program looks at the efforts being made across the UK to find reasons for the plight of the bumblebee , to conserve the most threatened species and even reverse the trend . \nAlso featured is the world 's first working bumblebee sniffer dog , trained to find their elusive nests , a vital part of the research . \nMuch less abundant than honeybees , bumblebees pollinate the countryside out of all proportion to their numbers . \nThey get to work early in the year , in the rain and the cold , while their better-known cousins shelter in their hives , and many bumblebee species have long tongues that mean they can get into flowers that honeybees ca n't pollinate . \nThe most important beneficiaries include soft fruits like strawberries and blueberries , so much so that Scottish fruit growers are importing bumblebee nests from Holland to counteract the decline . \nHowever , this greatly worries experts who fear they could import disease , and argue that efforts should go into boosting native species . \n6.30-10 .30 pm BBC RADIO 5 LIVE Mark Pougatch presents live second-half commentary of CSKA Moscow versus Manchester United in the Champions League , from

work of American artist Ed Ruscha , the young novelist Bidisha asks how people should read words by artists . \nFiona Banner writes stories but she 's not a writer -- she 's an artist who writes them directly onto gallery walls . \nShe 's following in a tradition of artists who have made art out of words . \nRichard Long goes on long walks but in the gallery the art work is a pile of stones and a list of words evoking his walk . \nIan Hamilton Finlay made his name carving words onto stones and creating a garden of words at his home in Scotland . \nBidisha investigates where the dividing line lies between art and writing : She spends time sitting in a gallery to see whether people actually read the art works inscribed on the walls or simply pass through looking for the next picture . \nAn

state 's leader . \nHe befriends Adam , a fellow trainee double . \nBut their lives separate as Adam fails the course and Daniel graduates as the No. 1 decoy and begins to undertake his official

{"id": "764", "time": "2011-11-07", "text": "By David Willis BBC News , Los Angeles Michael Jackson died in June 2009 Michael Jackson was in good spirits . \nWith less than three weeks to go before the start of a series of comeback concerts at London 's O2 arena even he , the ultimate perfectionist , had to admit things were looking good . \nAfter viewing the video clips that would accompany such classic hits as Billie Jean and She 's Out of My Life , Jackson had led the company in their first dress rehearsal of Thriller . \nWhen it was over he hugged the dancers and thanked the crew . \nSeveral of those who were present that night at the Los Angeles Staples Center said he was grinning from ear to ear . \nIt was a little after one o'clock in the morning by the time Jackson returned to the French chateau-style mansion he had been renting on the outskirts of Beverly Hills . \nWaiting for him in his bedroom on the first floor was Conrad Murray . \nTall and softly-spoken , Dr Murray had grown up on the Caribbean island of Grenada and like his father , who was also a doctor , moved to America in the hope of making a better life for himself . \nHe had been introduced to Michael Jackson three years previously by a patient who had worked for Jackson . \nOn the night in question Dr Murray had served as the singer 's personal physician for barely two months . \nNevertheless , he was familiar with the routine . \nOnce Michael Jackson had emerged from the shower Dr Murray applied cream to his back to treat a pigmentation disorder known as vitiligo and the two men then settled into the more challenging aspect of their nightly ritual : getting Jackson to sleep . \nExperience had taught Dr Murray that this could be a prolonged routine . \nOn this occasion it was to last until well after sunrise . \nFast forward to a little after noon on the same day and the calm of the eight-bedroom mansion was shattered by the sound of shouting from Jackson 's bedroom - followed a few minutes later by the sound of people racing up the stairs . \nParamedics responding to a call about a 50-year-old man suffering cardiac arrest found Michael Jackson sprawled across the floor in his pyjamas with a surgical cap on his head . \nOxygen tanks littered the doorway ; a child-sized porcelain doll lay on the bed . \nThe heating was on - despite the fact that this was the middle of summer - and sweat was pouring down Dr Murray 's face as he attempted mouth-to-mouth resuscitation . \nDr Murray has admitted to administering propofol to Jackson in his bedroom But one look at Jackson 's limp , lifeless body told the paramedics there was nothing they could do . \nHis pupils were already dilated and his skin cold to the touch . \nThe faux French chateau , which Michael Jackson had been renting in LA - for a reported $ 100,000 -LRB- # 62,000 -RRB- a month - had seen some illustrious neighbors . \nBarbra Streisand , Frank Sinatra , Mick Jagger and Cher had all called the same street home . \nBut the fact that Jackson 's all-time idol Elvis Presley had once lived just around the corner may ultimately have been what persuaded him to move there . \nMinutes after the news broke of Jackson 's death that same street - a stone 's throw from Sunset Boulevard - was swarming with reporters . \nNews helicopters hovered overhead , satellite trucks jammed the side streets . \nIt had been more than four years since I - or any other journalist present that day - had last seen Jackson . \nThat was in the town of Santa Maria , in the heart of California wine country , following his acquittal on charges of child sex abuse in 2005 . \nCovering that trial every day for nearly four months I was struck by the effect the proceedings seemed to have on Jackson 's wellbeing . \nWe all remember the pictures of him shuffling into court in his pyjamas but there were times when he almost seemed to be withering away in front of our very eyes as details of his unorthodox lifestyle were dished up for the world to see . \nJackson considered the charges against him outrageous and the documentary which prompted them a `` betrayal '' . \nAlthough the verdict went in his favor , there was little doubt in my mind that he left Santa Maria a broken man . \nUnsurprisingly perhaps , friends say it was around the time of that court case that Jackson started finding it increasingly difficult to get to sleep . \nHe had suffered from a variety of ailments over the years but none compared to the torment he endured once the lights went out . \n`` I once said Michael would have paid a $ 1m for a good night 's sleep and though I was being somewhat facetious , in many ways it was true , '' Jackson 's biographer J Randy Taraborrelli told the BBC . \nFans of Jackson have waited outside the Los Angeles courthouse throughout the six-week long trial `` When stressed out he could n't sleep . \nMichael told me once that when he went to bed he could n't stop the creative process . \n`` He was always creating , imagining , wondering how things would work out and what he could do to make them better . ' \nI ca n't turn it off ' was how he put it to me . ' \nI wish I could . \nBut I ca n't ' . '' \nMeaning that the more he needed it , the more elusive sleep became . \nHence the decision to go `` doctor shopping '' in a quest to find someone who would prescribe the one substance he knew could save him from sleeplessness . \nDr Conrad Murray told detectives he first became aware of propofol after he allowed another doctor to treat Jackson at his surgery in Las Vegas . \nJackson slept soundly and when he awoke the two men discussed the possibility of Murray accompanying Michael Jackson to London . \nDr Murray , who throughout that interview referred to Jackson as a `` friend '' , initially asked for $ 5m . \nWhen the tour promoters , who were footing the bill on the Jackson 's behalf , baulked at that price he agreed to lower it to $ 150,000 a month . \nThose who knew Michael Jackson well all seem to agree on one thing . \nGifted though he was as an entertainer - and , at times , as a businessman - as a judge of character his skills frequently left something to be desired . \nJackson 's sister La Toya referred to the `` shadowy entourage '' of handlers who frequently attached themselves to him like barnacles to a ship . \nMichael Jackson 's previous Los Angeles home Neverland Over the years there was a virtual `` revolving door '' of assistants and advisors , many of whom seemed to bring a lot less to the table than they took from it . \n`` Michael put his trust in a lot of people over the years , '' said Mr Taraborrelli . \n`` He always gave people the benefit of the doubt . \nHe would wait until a person proved him wrong before that person would be ousted from his life . \n-LRB- In some cases -RRB- he waited too long . '' \nThe tragedy of this tale is that it could all have ended so very differently . \nOnce the concerts at London 's O2 arena had come to an end Michael Jackson was planning to take the show on a worldwide tour and use the proceeds to build a hospital for disadvantaged children , headed - you 've guessed it - by Dr Conrad Murray . \nHe also intended to spend more time with his three children - Paris , Prince and Prince Michael II , known as Blanket - whom he was raising alone . \nThe mansion he once occupied may also have changed hands effortlessly had he survived . \nYet with Neverland long-since closed and Jackson 's grave off-limits to anyone other than family and friends , it has become - by default - a focal point for fans desperate for a link to their hero , no matter how macabre that link may be . \nWhich almost certainly was not what the owner - the head of the Ed Hardy fashion chain - had in mind when he bought the place . \nHe has made two attempts to sell it since Michael Jackson died but has yet to attract a buyer . \nThe pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ? \n"}
{"id": "599", "time": "2011-11-07", "text": "By Andrew Cohen The Atlantic Murray will be sentenced on 29 November , and was held without bail after his conviction The last doctor of Michael Jackson 's life was convicted of manslaughter by a California jury because the law demanded it and the facts supported it . \nDr Conrad Murray was at Jackson 's home when the pop star died , sloppily administering medicine that should only have been administered in a hospital . \nThere are , I suspect , few jurors in the world who would have gone out of their way to search for a more complex narrative in order to spare the defendant a few years or months in jail . \nThroughout the trial , Murray 's lawyers tried gingerly to blame Jackson himself for his own death , a tactic which reflected both the desperation of the defense case and the nature of California 's involuntary manslaughter statute . \nTeam Murray hoped that if jurors blamed the singer himself for an overdose , they might mete out a measure of sympathy for a doctor who , like so many other doctors who treat celebrities , thought he had his patient under control when he did not . \nCalifornia law , however , makes this a very difficult proposition . \nIt is not enough to demonstrate , as Murray 's lawyers did , that the victim of the crime contributed to his own death . \nEven if Jackson injected himself with the drug that ultimately killed him , prosecutors told jurors in closing arguments , Murray should have foreseen that this would occur because he knew that Jackson liked to `` push '' his own drugs . \nGiven this standard , what chance did Murray ever really have ? \nThe rest of world envisioned a tragic end for Jackson ... After covering his 2005 molestation trial I certainly did . \nWhy did n't Murray ? '' \nThe prosecution 's theory resonated with the jury because it was founded on the language of the statute as announced during jury instructions . \nBut when you stop and think about it , it is truly an extraordinary thing . \nCalifornia is about to send a man to prison - for a while anyway - even though many reasonable people would agree that Jackson played a prominent role in his own death . \nThe law says that Murray should have known better , even if Jackson did not ; that the doctor had a responsibility to his patient even if his patient were bent on pushing past medically acceptable standards . \nYou could say , as Murray 's lawyers implied , that the good doctor was in the wrong place at the wrong time . \nThey acknowledged , as they had to , that their client 's professional performance during the fatal episode was not what any of us would want from our own bedside doctors . \nBut the defense lawyers tried to take the mens rea element , the criminal element , out of the case . \nMurray may have been a quack , they argued , but he had absolutely no bad intent toward the richest patient he or any private doctor was ever likely to have . \nOr you could say , as prosecutors did , that any good doctor would not have come anywhere near the circus that was Jackson 's relationship with prescription drugs . \nHow long Murray will spend behind bars is up to Judge Michael Pastor Murray did not officially represent the King of Pop for long . \nBut like everyone else in the world he surely knew that he was taking on a patient with a reputation for using drugs to try to tune out the demons which afflicted him . \nThe rest of world envisioned a tragic end for Jackson along these lines . \nAfter covering his 2005 molestation trial I certainly did . \nWhy did n't Murray ? \nThe just-completed trial was a good one , in which the lawyers ably represented their causes and the trial judge , Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Michael Pastor , did a laudable job keeping control of a celebrity case . \nOn 29 November , during sentencing , I believe that Judge Pastor will show more mercy to Murray than did his jurors . \nMurray faces anywhere from probation to four years , but it is clear from the fact that he is now in jail - the judge denied bail pending sentencing - that Judge Pastor is going to give him some prison time . \nMy bet is that the sentence will be towards the lower side . \nCalifornia 's prisons are notoriously overcrowded . \nIn fact , the state has been forced by the United States Supreme Court to reduce the prison population to more manageable levels . \nMichael Jackson 's billion or so fans may argue that Conrad Murray deserves the hardest time possible . \nBut the truth of the matter is that the eternal law of economics is on Murray 's side . \nHe made terrible errors in judgment , and he 's paying the price . \nAnd none of that will ever bring back Michael Jackson or tell us what next might have happened had he lived through that day . \n8th November 2011 - 17:42 This comment was removed because the moderators found it broke the house rules . \n8th November 2011 - 17:40 This comment was removed because the moderators found it broke the house rules . \n9th November 2011 - 8:40 This comment was removed because the moderators found it broke the house rules . \n9th November 2011 - 8:26 This to me seems like the infectious American legal and suing culture . \nAlways someone else 's fault . \nFrankly mj was running himself to an early grave long before Murray had the misfortune of meeting him . \nIt 's just a shame that Jackson could n't have just got his head down and led a quiet life outside of his music career . \n9th November 2011 - 7:46 Oh please . \nWhen the doctor decided to take all that money from Michael Jackson , he immediately began to violate his professional oath -- `` do no harm '' . \nHe took the job for the money and should suffer as much as the law allows for it . \nHe administered an illegal drug in an illegal situation , left the scene of the crime ; in fright waited to call 911 ; and then lied to them about it all . \nAll posts are reactively-moderated and must obey the house rules . \nThe pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ? \n"}

'' \nBefore the earthquake hit , many people lived in very poor conditions - with only half of children going to school . \nHannah says the kids are a priority : CLIP : `` Children in Haiti have undergone more suffering in the last year than most children in other countries will ever know in their lifetime . \nThey 've lost close friends and family , they 've seen children like them suffer from cholera and very threatening illnesses . \nThey 've had to undergo so much it will have a profound impact on their lives for ever . \nBut we also know that children if they 're given the right support can be highly resilient and they can bounce back . \nBut they need to be able to return to a normal childhood as quickly as possible . '' \nNext -- there 's to be a trial over the death of pop singer Michael Jackson eighteen months ago . \nA judge in Los Angeles has ordered his personal doctor to face charges of being accidentally involved in his death -- and not giving the singer proper care . \nDr Conrad Murray says -- he 's not guilty . \nFinally an Italian man has astonished doctors by sneezing a bullet out through his nose after being shot in the head . \nDarco Sangermano was in hospital waiting for treatment when the bullet popped out of his right nostril . \nHe 's expected to make a full recovery . \nAnd for today 's question : how fast does the average sneeze travel ? \nYesterday we asked what two awards were joined to make the new FIFA world player award ? \nAnd the answer is : French Football magazine 's and the old FIFA player of the year awards . \nOK , that 's all from the World News for Schools team . \nWe 're back tomorrow ! \n"}

'' \nPropofol is a sedative that is normally used in hospitals to induce or maintain anaesthesia during surgical procedures . \nIt will be up to the jury to decide whether the actions of Dr Murray , during the frantic efforts to revive the singer and in the hours before , caused his death . \n`` We 're finally going to get a full airing of all the facts , '' says Steven Cron , a legal analyst . \n`` In order to be guilty of a crime one has to be grossly negligent , not just minimally negligent , and that 's what they 're trying to prove , '' says Mr Cron . \nDr Murray has strongly defended himself against the charge of involuntary manslaughter . \nHe has insisted that nothing he did should have killed Jackson . \n`` I think the forensic evidence is going to be really important , '' says Mr Cron . \n`` There were only two people in the room and one of them is no longer with us . \nThe other is accused . '' \nThe jury will hear testimony from dozens of witnesses , including some of those who were first on the scene , such as Jackson 's security guards and paramedics . \nExperts will also be called upon to answer questions about Propofol , which will be at the heart of the case . \nIt has been suggested by Dr Murray 's lawyers that the publicity surrounding the case could rise to the levels seen during the murder trial of the former American footballer-turned movie actor OJ Simpson in 1995 . \nBut the judge has refused a request to have the jury sequestered , or confined to a hotel , to shield them from outside influences , as they were during the Simpson trial . \nJermaine Jackson said he is prepared for a media `` circus '' Instead , Judge Michael Pastor has advised them not to `` read , listen to or watch any news report or any other commentary about this case from any source '' and to `` keep an open mind throughout '' . \n`` I think the Conrad Murray trial will be the trial of the year -LRB- but -RRB- it will not be the trial of the century , '' says Linda Deutsch , a special correspondent with the Associated Press , and a veteran reporter at high profile cases in California . \nWhile the defendant , Dr Murray , is not a celebrity , the trial will receive global attention because the alleged victim is Jackson , the superstar who is still worshipped by fans around the world . \nThe proceedings , like the Simpson trial , are being televised . \nMedia outlets from around the world set up makeshift studios near the court building . \nHundreds of Jackson fans lined the street . \nThere will be a lottery every morning to allocate seats in the public gallery . \n`` The fact that it is Michael Jackson puts an entirely different profile on this case Michael Jackson was a fascinating man and he still fascinates even in death , '' says Ms Deutsch . \nThe singer 's parents and famous siblings are all expected to make an appearance at LA 's Criminal Court building , taking it in turns to fill the eight seats the family has been allocated in the courtroom . \nJackson 's three children will not attend the trial . \n`` We 're ready , '' says his brother Jermaine Jackson , `` We 're always ready for whatever . \nWe 've been raised and taught to take it as it comes .

{"id": "948", "time": "2011-10-13", "text": "Every day is a lottery at the trial of Conrad Murray , Michael Jackson 's doctor , who stands accused of killing perhaps the world 's most famous singer . \nJackson fans line up against the courtroom wall at 07:30 every morning in the hope of winning a draw for one of the few seats in the public gallery . \nLike millions of others across America and the world they could watch it on the internet or on TV , but there is obviously something more to be gained from being there in person , sitting just a few feet from the lawyers , the family and the accused . \nI joined the draw two days in a row - second-time lucky - to get a feel for the courtroom and to immerse myself in a trial that has been creating a buzz across America . \nIt was an interesting day to sit in on the trial . \nIt was a day which began with what the TV pundits called a `` cornerstone of the defense '' being pulled away , and went on to hear some damning accusations of `` gross negligence '' against the man whom Michael Jackson trusted as his doctor . \nBefore proceedings even began , before the 16 men and women of the jury had been buzzed into their seats , the defense had conceded Michael Jackson could not have drunk the drug which killed him . \nPropofol is what it the trial all about . \nIt is is an extremely strong sedative and Michael Jackson was having his doctor use it to help him get to sleep . \nIt was a combination of that and a number of other sedatives which caused his death - and as the man prescribing the pills , injections and intravenous drugs , Conrad Murray stands accused of causing his death by involuntary manslaughter . \nOne key line of defense is that Michael Jackson took the drugs himself , when his doctor was not looking . \nA presumption made by the countless commentators , TV experts , ex-prosecutors and journalists was that Michael Jackson drank the drug . \nBut research by both the prosecution and the defense proved it was only effective if injected straight into the blood . \nAnd so a line of questioning defense lawyers may have used , and indeed hinted they would use , was dropped - but not the theory of self-medication altogether . \nJackson could have injected himself , or taken other pills , but that is for another day of evidence or for when the defense case begins . \nBut this day was all about independent medical experts and their professional opinion of Dr Murray . \nThey were not impressed . \nFor much of the day cardiologist Dr Alon Steinberg was in the stand , describing how he had reviewed Dr Murray 's own account of what happened the night Michael Jackson died , as told to a detective . \nHe outlined six separate instances of what he called `` gross negligence . '' \n`` Propofol should never be given as a sleeping drug , '' was his premise , explaining it was a strong sedative used as an anesthetic in surgical operations and its use in this way was negligent and unethical . \nOnce given the drug , Michael Jackson should have been monitored properly , all the time , with heart and blood pressure monitors , back-up drugs and equipment in case anything went wrong . \nAnd perhaps most damning of all , he said the way Conrad Murray reacted when Jackson stopped breathing was `` responsible for the singer 's death '' . \nBy not immediately calling the emergency services , taking the wrong action in those vital few minutes and not having prepared for an emergency , he had made `` a direct contribution to Michael Jackson 's death '' , Dr Steinberg told the court . \nThe second witness , Professor Nader Kamangar , was equally critical of the use of such a powerful sedative which he said required proper training and was usually given in a hospital or clinical environment , not in someone 's home . \nHe also reviewed Conrad Murray 's account of what happened , and as a sleep medicine expert stressed propofol should not be used for insomnia . \nThe two independent witnesses helped build up a strong picture of a poor doctor who did not follow basic procedure and was negligent . \nIt is a picture the defense will be keen to undermine in the cross-examination of Prof Kamangar , with the prosecution continuing to build its case against Conrad Murray as the trial approaches its half-way mark . \nMeanwhile the Jackson fans will keep on arriving for the daily lottery , to secure one of those precious seats in the courtroom . \nThe pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ? \n"}

their recently released album . \nBob also plays Natalie Merchant 's final acoustic session track . \nMention the songs of Hugo Wolf and the one likely reaction is to find them humorless , dense and difficult . \nYet his songs can be biting or tender , funny or sad , erotic or esoteric and as immediately appealing as anything by Schubert or Schumann . \nWith performances of Wolf 's songs by Fischer-Dieskau , Elly Ameling , Ian Bostridge and Barbra Streisand among others , BBC Radio 's 3 resident song-lover Iain Burnside traces Wolf 's life and aims as a composer through his varied song collections . \nHe is joined by fellow Wolf enthusiasts Graham Johnson , Susan Youens , Amanda Glauert and Jeremy Sams . \nBurnside examines how Wolf 's sense of humor made him as many friends as enemies ; how Wagner was both an ardent inspiration and a curse on Wolf 's career ; how Bizet 's opera , Carmen , brought a new clarity of vision to Wolf 's late song collections ; and how the richness and sophistication of Wolf recordings past may be inhibiting the appreciation of Wolf today . \nMusician and writer Banning Eyre heads to the American state of Georgia -- gateway to the Deep

Theatre Awards for his performance . \nHis performance is the culmination and a direct result of Lenny 's exploration of Shakespeare on previous BBC Radio 4 programs . \nLenny plays the brave and noble Othello who allows himself to be duped by the evil and manipulative Iago into thinking his wife is unfaithful . \nHis descent from majestic dignity to deluded rage , culminating in the murder of

Leesley , David Beckford , Simon Holland Roberts , Victoria Gee , Andy Cryer and Chris Pearse . \nFrom Falstaff at the Boar 's Head to John Self at the Shakespeare in Martin Amis 's Money , English literature and the pub are intertwined . \nRobert Hanks presents an elegy for pubs in literature , and an exploration of what the smoking ban , the gastro pub and the five quid pint are going to do to writing . \nFor some writers , the pub has been the emblem of a hearty , democratic brand of Englishness : Hogarth 's wholesome Beer Alley , as opposed to sordid Gin Lane ; Dickens in the 19th century ; and , in the 20th , Wells , Chesterton , Belloc , Orwell , Kingsley Amis and even JK Rowling . \nFor other writers , pubs have been refuges for the seedy and desperate : Patrick Hamilton , Julian Maclaren-Ross and the George Orwell of Coming Up For Air . \nPubs have provided the settings for storytellers : PG Wodehouse 's Mr Mulliner holding court at the Angler 's Rest ; Arthur C Clarke 's band of scientists competing to see who can tell the tallest tale at the White Hart ; and , in TS Eliot 's The Waste Land , the pub became a place haunted by death and apocalypse . \nPubs have also been the places where writers have met , to talk about writing , or to forget about it : Johnson and Boswell at the Mitre in Fleet Street ; CS Lewis , JRR Tolkien and the other Inklings at the Eagle And Child in Oxford ; Dylan Thomas and Julian MacLaren-Ross at the Wheatsheaf in Rathbone Place , Fitzrovia ; Louis MacNeice at the George ; and Jeffrey Bernard and many others at the Coach And Horses in Soho . \nRobert Hanks taps some old archival barrels and discusses the pub , using drama and readings archive , as well as old interviews and a few new ones . \nThe program also considers the changing nature of the pub and whether there is any room there for the writer in the age of 24-hour drinking , quizzes and chain-pubs . \n12.00noon-7 .20 pm BBC RADIO 5 LIVE Mark Pougatch presents an

princess finds herself admired and taunted by those around her . \nAnd , while they gossip cruelly , she becomes helplessly and dangerously caught up in matters of love . \nPlayfully adapted , this radio dramatisation offsets the princess 's painful conflict between duty and love with characters who delight in the wickedness of their world . \nMarybeth Hamilton tells the story of the invention of ethnographic fieldwork by Bronislaw Malinowski in the early years of the 20th century , and how living with the people being studied became a guiding tenet of all anthropology . \nMalinowski stumbled into a prolonged stay in the Pacific almost by accident and wrote private diaries that some have thought jeopardised his more scholarly findings . \nBut his studies -- appearing at the same time as Freud was writing and literary modernism was changing how the world was perceived -- have retained their value , and his fieldwork methods have spread into a host of creative and intellectual pursuits . \nNinety-year-old June Spencer is the actress better known to listeners as Peggy in The Archers . \nShe is the only member of the cast who was part of the original pilots , 60 years ago

boat-shaped altar , where families of sailors would pray for their safety . \nReligion has played an important part in sea-faring towns ; however , in Robin Hood 's Bay in North Yorkshire , folk singers Mike and Norma Waterson talk about pagan rituals and a reverence for the sea god Oceana , which was common among sailors . \nRichard discovers that it 's not just pagan gods and the Christian God who play a huge part in the lives of sailors and people who live on the coast . \nIn Cornwall and Devon he hears stories about mermaids and selkies and other mythical sea creatures and monsters that feature heavily in folk songs and stories in coastal towns . \nFinally , in Glasgow , he speaks to Belle And Sebastian 's Stuart Murdoch about some of the most important fantasy novels written about life on the ocean and how the idea of going to sea has inspired some of the UK 's most important novelists . \nThis episode also features contributions from Soft Machine 's Robert Wyatt , poet Simon Armitage , Jon Boden from Bellowhead and folk singer Christina Stewart . \nMonday 1 to Friday 5 March Donald Macleod explores Frederic Chopin 's time at Nohant , the country retreat of his lover George Sand , where over seven long summers towards the end of his life he composed much of his finest music including , in today 's program , his mazurkas Op 41 and his second piano sonata , which shocked contemporary audiences . \nChopin first met writer George Sand in Paris in 1836 . \nHe was , as ever , impeccably turned out , down to his trademark white kid gloves . \nShe was smoking a cigar and dressed in men 's clothing . \nShe struck him as extraordinary , even repellent but a year later , perhaps bruised from having had a marriage proposal rejected , he reacted quite differently . \nThey appear to have become lovers by June 1838 , and spent seven summers together at Sand 's manor house at Nohant , some 150 miles south of Paris . \nNohant was an important element in the chemistry of the relationship between Chopin and Sand -- a real blessing , since Chopin found it impossible to concentrate on composition among all the dizzy distractions of Paris . \nIn this bucolic oasis , `` the little one '' , as Sand called him , produced much of his greatest work . \nThis week , Donald Macleod lingers in Nohant 's spacious rooms , looking out at the surrounding parkland , or wandering among its trees , telling stories of the strange relationship between the two and listening to the music that Chopin composed here . \nA week of concerts featuring Scottish music ensembles begins with Stphane Den ve conducting the Royal Scottish National Orchestra in works by Berlioz , Respighi and Guillaume Connesson . \nStphane Den ve , musical director of the Royal Scottish National Orchestra since 2005 , has a great affinity with music from his native France and this program includes two contrasting French works -- the exhilarating and flamboyant showpiece for orchestra , Berlioz 's Roman Carnival Overture ; and the equally dazzling work by the young French composer Guillaume Connesson called A Glimmer In The Age Of Darkness , which the orchestra premired in 2005 . \nThe color and drama of both these works , using the full scope of this large symphony orchestra , is matched in Respighi 's masterpiece from his Roman Trilogy , The Pines Of Rome -- as grand an image of the great city as one can imagine painted with a huge range of percussion , brass , bells , celeste and organ and brass . \nRussian pianist Nicolai Lugansky joins the orchestra to play Beethoven 's Third Piano Concerto -- on a smaller scale , but equally dynamic in its own way . \nLugansky made his name overnight when he won the 1994 Tchaikovsky Piano Competition and has built a formidable international reputation for his interpretations . \nThe concert is recorded at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall -- the regular venue for the RSNO in Glasgow . \nPhilip Dodd reviews Tim Burton 's much-anticipated imagining of Lewis Carroll 's classic fantasy , Alice In Wonderland , and looks at Don DeLillo 's new novel , Point Omega . \nBurton has carved a niche as cinema 's foremost purveyor of the gothic through films such as Edward Scissorhands and Sweeney Todd . \nPhilip finds out how Carroll 's classic has fared under its Burton makeover . \nDon DeLillo 's new novel is about a meeting of two men and one woman . \nOne is Richard Elster , a scholar and US Government war advisor . \nFor two years he has tried to make intellectual sense of troop deployments , counter-insurgency orders and secret renditions of US foreign policy , but has now retreated to an isolated house in the desert . \nThere he is joined by Jim Finley , a young film-maker intent on documenting his experience . \nThe two men talk and drink and are then joined by Elster 's daughter Jessie , who dramatically alters the dynamic . \nWhen a devastating event follows , all the men 's talk and the accumulated meaning of conversation and isolation are thrown into question . \nPianist and broadcaster Piers Lane looks at five aspects of Frederic Chopin 's life and music to celebrate 200 years since the composer 's birth . \nDrawing on extracts from Chopin 's own writing , and those who have written about him over the past two centuries , Piers looks at the myths , interpretations and veneration surrounding one of the most universally adored pianist\\/composers . \nChopin 's name is synonymous with ideas of romance and melancholy . \nIn this first program , Piers explores how , despite being labeled as the archetypal Romantic pianist , Chopin resisted much of what is now associated with 19th-century Romantic piano music -- the overt scene painting and descriptive title of his contemporaries such as Liszt , Berlioz or Schumann . \nLater in the week , Piers looks at how the composer innovated form and style on the piano , the instrument on which he focused so exclusively ; Chopin 's often overlooked role as one of the most sought-after teachers in Paris ; his composing process and interpretations of his music ; and the veneration from audiences and other composers that has always surrounded him . \nBBC Radio 3 presenter Jez Nelson Jez Nelson presents a giant of jazz , American saxophonist Joe Lovano , in concert at Ronnie Scott 's . \nJoe Lovano weaves together jazz past , present and future with his acclaimed quintet Us Five , featuring James Weidman on piano , bassist Esperanza Spalding and drummers Otis Brown and Francesco Mela . \nBorn in Ohio to a musical family in 1952 , Joe rose to prominence during the Eighties playing with John Scofield 's quartet and Paul Motion 's bass-less trio with Bill Frisell . \nSince then he has led many of his own groups , developing a tone that combines Stan Getz 's breathy melodic style and John Coltrane 's gruffness with a deep-seated knowledge of jazz composition . \nMonday 1 to Friday 5 March In 1967 , a chance meeting between Patti Smith and Robert Mapplethorpe led to a romance and a lifelong friendship that sustained them as they sought and found phenomenal artistic success . \nThey made a pact to always care for each other and to devote themselves to art . \nCreatively , their paths would diverge . \nPatti set her poems to music and became a rock 'n' roll star . \nRobert became a brilliant and controversial photographer . \nBut from time to time their paths intersected , most memorably in the photo shoot for the cover of Patti 's first album , Horses . \nWritten and read by Patti Smith , Just Kids paints an extraordinary portrait of cultural New York from the late Sixties to the mid-Seventies . \nThe story takes in Brooklyn , the Chelsea Hotel , Max 's Kansas City , Scribner 's Bookstore , Coney Island and Andy Warhol 's Factory . \nTheir paths cross with musicians and artists including Bobby Neuwirth , Janis Joplin , Jimi Hendrix , Allen Ginsberg , Sam Shepherd and William Burroughs . \nIn this explosive political and artistic climate , two young artists keep each other going through the hunger , days of filched steaks , cous-cous and lettuce soup . \nMonday 1 to Friday 5 March Beyond Black is a 10-part dramatisation of Hilary Mantel 's blackly comic novel about a professional medium with a troubled past , traveling around the seedy halls of suburban England with her sceptical assistant . \nAlison Hart is an awkward , obese , disorganised woman , but with a gift for empathy and a good platform technique . \nHer familiar spirits are figures from her chaotic childhood , principal among them a small , foul-mouthed circus performer with disgusting personal habits called Morris , who is her unpleasant and bitter spirit guide . \nAlison plies her trade in the dormitory towns just beyond the outskirts of London , acting as a channel between the sad and credulous living and the clamorous dead . \nTo try to create some order in her messy existence , she takes on an assistant , the highly efficient but essentially heartless Colette , who , although she is a regular witness to Alison 's gift , is nevertheless a profoundly sceptical companion . \nThe two of them are bound together by a need that neither wants to recognize . \nAs they travel from one psychic fair , community hall or pub function room to another , they are accompanied by the vulgar , belching Morris -- invisible to Colette but occasionally identified by a whiff of sewage in the air . \nAnd Morris has friends , a violent gang of petty thieves among whom Alison grew up , who abused her as a child and who continue to haunt her now they are dead . \nOnly by recognizing and confronting her demons can Alison banish them -- but the dead are persistent , and before Alison can find peace , she has to face up to the memories of her damaged past . \nBeyond Black , by Man Booker 2009 winner Hilary Mantel , was shortlisted for the Orange Prize in 2006 , and is one of her

. \nJim 's new play , Ashes To Antarctica , tells the story of Jill Foster , a woman who is determined to scatter her husband 's ashes on the ice , as a memento of his work with the British Antarctic Survey years ago . \nBut she meets with the opposition of one of the scientists on her expedition , Chilean Dr Emilie Prado , who befriends her and works to convince her that she would be doing the

schools on contaminated land , as the investigative environmental series continues . \nWhen Corby Borough Council was ruled to be negligent in its efforts to clean up the site of the town 's enormous steelworks a shiver ran through the building industry . \nFor a decade now builders have been urged to build new homes , offices , distribution centres and hospitals on brownfield land . \nThis meant that former industrial eyesores were cleaned up and farm and parkland was saved from the bulldozers . \nLast summer 's court judgement opened the way for families who believe their children were born with birth defects because of airborne contamination from the Corby development to seek compensation . \nAs a result , groups opposing development on their local patch of contaminated land have been given powerful ammunition . \nAlice visits development sites across the country to ask what impact the Corby decision will have on Britain 's building industry and question whether it will be cheaper and safer for risk-averse councils and developers to turn their attention back to greenfield land . \nRose Tremain 's compelling and unsettling new novel concerns sibling love , disputed territory and

three-part series . \nThe cheap availability of the video cassette and the cheap production values of the films being made meant that , in the UK , audiences stopped going to the cinemas of Southall , Bradford and Wolverhampton and started to stay in . \nIn this program , Nikki looks at where the art of Hindi film strayed from its `` super hit '' formula of real-life stories and real-life heroes and took to portraying the richer lifestyles and locations of the ex-pats in the audiences . \nMeanwhile , the UK audience was finding new ways of expressing itself with the rise of the Asian

features a new work by Scottish-based composer Sally Beamish , who began her career as a viola player in the Raphael ensemble . \nHer work is strongly informed by this experience and inspired by the colors created when matching solo instruments together in different relationships . \nThe Scottish Ensemble , with Jonathan Morton and Clio Gould , perform string music by Tippett , Berio , Bach and Vaughan Williams . \nNormally an 11-piece string group , The Scottish Ensemble is enhanced for this concert in an innovative educational project with gifted young players from St Mary 's Music School in Edinburgh and students from the Royal Scottish Academy Of Music And Drama . \nTogether , they provide an extraordinary experience for those young players working side-by-side with leading musicians in their field . \nTheir program demonstrates the eclecticism of the ensemble 's repertoire , which ranges from contemporary through romantic repertoire to baroque and includes Tippett 's jazz-influenced Concerto for Double String Orchestra , Berio 's Corale based on the Sequenza for solo violin , Bach 's Double Violin Concerto , Vaughan Williams 's beloved Fantasia On A Theme Of Thomas Tallis and an encore of the finale of Grieg 's Holberg Suite . \nThe Ensemble is led from the violin by Jonathan Morton . \nThey are joined on this occasion by the group 's previous artistic director , Clio Gould , who performs the fiendish solo part in Berio 's Corale and joins Morton in the Bach Double Concerto . \nMark Lawson looks at landscapes , interiors and underworlds in the fourth episode of Capturing America . \nIn books ranging from John Updike 's The Rabbit Quartet to Marilynne Robinson 's Housekeeping , writers have captured the texture of everyday life -- work , thoughts and beliefs -- in different regions of America . \nUpdike always remembered being inspired by the Sixties Pop Art of Andy Warhol and others -- an attempt to catch the visual reality of modern America . \nUpdike responded by trying to achieve something similar in fiction , depicting the lives of people from places and backgrounds which had often been ignored . \nRichard Ford -LRB- The Sportswriter trilogy -RRB- , John Irving -LRB- The Cider House Rules -RRB- , Marilynne Robinson -LRB- Housekeeping , Gilead -RRB- and Jonathan Franzen -LRB- The Corrections -RRB- also reflect on this mission to describe the external and internal nature of life in the US in all its regional and personal variety . \nOscar-winning writer Frederic Raphael 's TV drama series , The Glittering Prizes , was one of the great successes of the late Seventies . \nStarring Tom Conti and set in the early Fifties , it followed the fortunes of a group of undergraduates , watching how their hopes and ambitions were fulfilled , or not , in the next 25 years . \nAfter the success of the BBC Radio 4 adaptation and its sequel , Fame And Fortune , Final Demands continues the story , chronicling English social life and public and private values in the last decade of the brutal 20th century . \nFinal Demands once again reunites many of the original cast , including Tom Conti , Barbara Kellermann , Nigel Havers , Mark Wing Davey , Angela Down , Malcolm Stoddard and Emily Richard . \nIt also introduces Julian Rhind Tutt , Colin McFarlane , Julian Glover and Alistair McGowan to this stellar cast . \nIt is now the Nineties and , for all of those friends from the Fifties , life has moved on . \nOnce again , Raphael brings all his wit , invention and insight to his diverse , vivid and utterly convincing group of characters . \nTom Conti stars as Adam Morris ; Barbara Kellermann as Barbara Morris ; Mark Wing-Davey as Mike Clode ; Alistair McGowan as Alan Parks ; Malcolm Sinclair as Gavin Pope ; Nigel Havers as Denis Porson ; Rupert Degas as Tom Morris ; Flora Montgomery as Rachel Morris ; Angela Down as Joyce Hadleigh ; Adrian Lukis as Derek Morris ; and Julian Rhind-Tutt as Jonty . \nAdam Rutherford investigates the new science of morality and talks to the researchers who are tackling an age-old problem with some cutting-edge techniques . \nUsing the latest brain-scanning technology with some well-known moral dilemmas , scientists at Harvard have been tackling a subject that strikes at the core of what it means to be human -- with some surprising and controversial results . \nWhat they are discovering suggests that morality could be hardwired in the brain -- a universal human trait honed by millions of years of evolution , rather than a process purely learned in childhood . \nHowever , where do such findings leave philosophy and religion ? \nAdam tracks down philosopher AC Grayling and the Dean of Guildford , Victor Stock , to ask whether they feel science can really tackle a subject as abstract and complex as morality . \nHe finds out how these radical new findings might impact hundreds of years of philosophical and sociological musings about where and why humans have a moral code . \n7.00-10 .30 pm BBC RADIO 5 LIVE Eleanor Oldroyd is joined by some top sports correspondents for The Headline Hour , discussing the week 's top sporting stories . \nAt

'' \nDr Murray had been hired to be Jackson 's personal physician last spring as the singer prepared for his comeback concerts in London . \nWe 'll make bail , we 'll plead not guilty and we 'll fight like hell But he has always maintained he neither prescribed nor administered anything that should have killed the singer . \nAfter a week of speculation over the manslaughter charge , Dr Murray had been expected to surrender to authorities last Friday . \nBut a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles district attorney said the office had decided to delay action until Monday . \nThe statement came after several days of negotiations , where Dr Murray 's lawyers tried to arrange for him to surrender to prosecutors in an attempt to avoid him being handcuffed and arrested . \nDr Murray was not handcuffed as he arrived in court . \nSpeaking before the charges were filed , the physician 's defense lawyer , Ed Chernoff , said the doctor was prepared for the legal battle ahead . \n`` We 'll make bail , we 'll plead not guilty and we 'll fight like hell , '' he said . \nThe charge follows months of careful investigation , with prosecutors said to be keen to avoid an unsuccessful high-profile prosecution like that of former football star OJ Simpson . \nOriginally from Grenada , Dr Murray moved to the US and trained as a doctor . \nIn 2000 , he opened his own practice in Las Vegas , expanding with a second clinic in Houston in 2006 . \nHowever , he encountered financial difficulties and reports suggest he filed for bankruptcy in 2002 while living in California . \nJackson hired the physician on a salary of more than $ 150,000 -LRB- # 96,000 -RRB- a month in May 2009 . \n"}

'' \nDr Murray 's lawyer , Edward Chernoff , said the case had put his client in fear of his life and he had to be accompanied `` 24\\/7 with a bodyguard '' . \nThe prosecution called Dr Murray 's girlfriends to testify `` He ca n't operate his practice , '' said the attorney . \n`` He ca n't go to work because he is harassed no matter where he goes . '' \nAccording to public records cited by the LA Times , Dr Murray had two children with his wife , but also fathered several children with different women . \nThose children included the now young toddler of Nicole Alvarez , an actress who met Dr Murray in 2005 . \nSeveral of Dr Murray 's recent girlfriends have also testified at his trial , as well as former patients . \nAccording to court records , he has been sued more than 10 times , including for breach of contract and unpaid child support . \nHe has never been sued for malpractice . \nThe pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ? \n"}

'' \nMr Chernoff added he would comment on the coroner 's report when it is officially released . \nDetails of the Los Angeles County coroners ' findings were revealed when a search warrant affidavit was made public in Houston , Texas , where Dr Murray has offices . \nDr Murray 's offices were raided last month as part of the police investigation into the singer 's death . \nThe coroner 's office has not published its findings regarding the singer 's death . \nAccording to the affidavit , the LA chief coroner `` had reviewed the preliminary toxicology results and his preliminary assessment of Jackson 's cause of death was due to lethal levels of propofol '' . \nThe documents go on to say that Dr Murray told police he had been giving Jackson propofol as part of his treatment for insomnia . \nBut , he said he had been concerned Jackson was becoming addicted to the drug and had been trying to wean him off , using alternative drugs . \nBut , on the morning of the singer 's death , Dr Murray is reported to have relented and given Jackson a lower dosage of propofol after a number of other drugs had not worked . \nHe left the star alone to make some telephone calls and when he returned Jackson was not breathing , the LA Times reports . \nDr Murray is known to have performed CPR on his patient while the paramedics were called , but Jackson was declared dead when he arrived at hospital . \nDr Conrad Murray speaking on 18 August : I told the truth Bottles of propofol found in Jackson 's house show it had been prescribed by several doctors , not just Conrad Murray , but he remains at the center of the inquiry , our correspondent adds . \nEarlier this month , Dr Murray - who was employed as Michael Jackson 's personal physician for a series of concerts in London scheduled for July - posted a video message on YouTube to thank his supporters . \n`` I told the truth and I have faith the truth will prevail , '' he said in the short one-minute clip . \n"}

'' \nFine words for a composer who , it seems , is largely neglected today . \nBBC Radio 3 's New Generation Artists scheme exists to provide concert and recording opportunities for some of the finest young talent on the international music scene . \nThis year , it celebrates 10 years of helping to establish and support the careers of stars such as Paul Lewis , the Belcea Quartet , Alison Balsom and Alice Coote . \nThroughout this summer 's BBC Proms season , BBC Radio 3 is broadcasting studio and concert performances by current members of the scheme , continuing tonight with the Pavel Haas Quartet , who perform the first quartet of their composer namesake . \nAlso , Austrian mezzo-soprano Daniela Lehner performs Schumann 's Maria Stuart Songs -- settings of poetry supposedly written by

\nArgentinian pianist Ingrid Fliter performs Chopin 's Sonata No. 3 in B minor to round off this evening 's selection . \nJanek 's opera , The Cunning Little Vixen , was based on a newspaper comic-strip adventure , a story of forest-dwellers , both animal and human , and nature 's ever-turning circle of life and death . \nSome of Janek 's most engaging and luminous music was selected by

stay in New York during the 1890s . \nHe wrote the title , From The New World , himself , on the front page of his score . \nAnd , though Dvo k stopped short of using any actual American melodies , it is often said that spiritual song Swing Low , Sweet Chariot appears tantalisingly close to the flute in the first movement . \nRainer Hersch , stand-up comedian and classical music specialist , remembers the brilliant and eccentric Gerard Hoffnung 's contribution to the comic side of classical music . \nHoffnung , who died 50 years ago this month , was a cartoonist and wit whose mocking of the solemn rituals of classical music created a sensation in the Fifties . \nAt a time when the symphony concert was , for the most part , a matter of great seriousness for music lovers , Gerard Hoffnung adored to see the funny side of those formalities . \nHis famous cartoons took the instruments of the orchestra -- and the eccentricities of the people who played them -- and sent them up mercilessly . \nIn 1956 , Hoffnung had the idea of translating the cartoons into real life . \nWith a combination of realisations of his weird cartoon instruments and suitably eccentric compositions to showcase them , the first Hoffnung Music Festival took place at the Royal Festival Hall in London . \nTwo further concerts followed -- around the time of Hoffnung 's untimely death at the age of 34 in 1959 . \nLater , the concerts were repeated for audiences around the world . \nFor this program , Rainer Hersch delves into the BBC archives to discover Hoffnung and those who were part of those first concerts . \nOn London 's South Bank , he encounters two musicians who had to grapple with these memorable , yet oddball , orchestral occasions . \nIn Search Of The Holy Quail Three ,

the decisions made by five conductors . \nA famous photograph of a celebratory banquet at the Berlin Festival in the summer of 1929 shows a group of internationally distinguished conductors -- Bruno Walter , Arturo Toscanini , Otto Klemperer , Erich Kleiber and Wilhelm Furtwangler . \nBerlin in the Twenties had been a vibrant cultural and scientific European center and attracted world-class conductors who premired some of the most avant garde productions in Europe . \nHowever , as reactionary forces began more organised protests , particularly against opera and theater , tensions around artistic freedom of expression became heightened . \nThe Berlin Festival of 1929 was a dazzling demonstration of the end of an epoch : not only did it feature German maestros Klemperer , Walter , Kleiber and Furtwangler , but it also attracted the entire company of La Scala from Milan under Toscanini . \nAll five conductors were headstrong and often at loggerheads with administrators and fellow musicians . \nThey all reacted strongly against totalitarianism and , in the Thirties , they found themselves in conflict with European fascism . \nFour of them looked elsewhere for the artistic freedom denied them by totalitarianism . \nHowever , Furtwangler stayed on in Nazi Germany , prompting questions about his political loyalties that still divide musicians , critics and fans today . \nRobert Giddings tells the stories of these five conductors through BBC archive recordings , including interviews with : Lotte Lehman ; Wagner 's daughter , Friedland ; Sir Adrian Boult ; George Solti ; and other significant figures in the European post-war music world . \nDanny Baker returns to Saturdays on BBC Radio 5 Live Danny Baker returns to Saturdays on BBC Radio 5 Live with a

investment banks in the world , with its headquarters in New York , filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection . \nIt was the largest bankruptcy filed in US history and sent the already unstable global financial markets into an uncontrollable tailspin . \nThis radio drama is a fictionalised account of events over the weekend prior to the bank 's demise . \nOn Friday evening , Timothy Geithner , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , summoned 30 of the most powerful bankers on Wall Street to discuss the future of Lehman . \nIt was put to the bankers that there would be no bail out from the US Treasury for the bank and that they themselves would need to devise a rescue plan , before the stock exchange opened on Monday morning . \nUnder extreme pressure , the bankers argued and negotiated , all too aware that Lehman was not the only bank of its kind in trouble . \nThis drama looks at how the critical decision was made to let Lehman die . \nWritten by award-winning writer Matthew Solon , the play is directed by John Dryden . \nThe drama was recorded , on location , in and around Wall Street . \nThe Day That Lehman Died is part of Aftershock -- a new season of programs

poet was born , not made , and his gifts might either flourish or wither depending on circumstance . \nIn his case he suspected that , had he grown up in a city , he might never have written a word . \nInstead , he lived in Orkney , and the islands for him became a `` place of order , a place of remembrance , a place of vision '' , which sustained him for the rest of his life . \nPoet Kenneth Steven travels to Stromness , where George Mackay Brown remained for almost his entire life , to speak to those who remember him and his influence in the community . \nMackay Brown was not always in keeping with local sensibilities and felt at times an outsider in Orkney life . \nYet it was the islands which sustained him , and this BBC Radio 3 Sunday Feature examines that complex relationship between writer and place . \nThe program includes contributions from Sir Peter Maxwell Davies , who met George Mackay Brown on his first visit to Orkney and collaborated regularly with him in the following years . \nSue MacGregor reunites people caught up in the siege at the Iranian Embassy in London in 1980 , as BBC Radio 4 's The Reunion continues . \nThe siege ended after six days when the Special Air Service dramatically stormed the building . \nThe storming of the Embassy established both the SAS 's lethal reputation and that of Margaret Thatcher as a Prime Minister who refused to give in to terrorists . \nThe siege began on 30 April 1980 when six men , armed with automatic weapons and grenades , overran the Embassy of the Islamic Republic Of Iran at Princes Gate , South Kensington , taking 26 people hostage . \nWithin hours of the attack , the SAS counter-terrorism team was assembled close by . \nThey built a replica of the five floor , 50-room building and began practicing their assault . \n`` As the days unfolded it was pure drama , a terrifying soap opera with all eyes glued to the Embassy 's front door , '' recalls the BBC 's Kate Adie , then a relatively unknown junior reporter who was camped out over the road opposite the Embassy . \nJoining Kate and Sue around the table are former hostages Sim Harris , who was seen crawling out the front window of the Embassy after the SAS went in ; Mustapha Kharkouti , who was thrown into the role of translator for the terrorists ; Max Vernon , one of the three specially trained police negotiators responsible for maintaining a dialogue with the terrorists ; and Robin Horsfall , an SAS commando , who took part in the rescue . \nMillions of people watched the rescue live on television , as bank holiday entertainment on all three channels was interrupted to show the real-life drama unfolding . \nThis two-part drama , marking 300 years since the birth of Samuel Johnson , portrays the relationship between the poet , wit , pioneering lexicographer and king of Grub Street and his devoted fan , James Boswell . \nStarring Kenneth Cranham as Johnson , part one sees Boswell , played by Paul Higgins , traveling to London especially to seek out the great man . \nBoswell , 30 years Johnson 's junior , is in awe of the man : `` I can not help worshipping him ; he is so superior to other men . '' \nHe determines to write a biography of Johnson and , encouraged by his hero , keeps journals of his conversations . \nJohnson is surrounded by leading artists and thinkers of the day such as Reynolds , Goldsmith , Burke , Garrick , Gibbon and Sheridan . \nWhen he paves the way for Boswell to join the `` club '' , the young man can not believe his luck . \nIn part two , Boswell 's visits become more intermittent and Johnson meets Hester Thrale , wife of a wealthy brewer and MP . \nShe becomes his devoted friend and confidante . \nWhen Hester 's husband dies , Johnson thinks she will turn to him , but she has fallen in love with an Italian opera singer and marries him instead . \nJohnson eventually sinks into a depression and dies ; and Boswell chides himself for not being a better friend . \nBarry MacSweeney wrote his first poem at the age of seven , endured a lifelong struggle with solitary hard drinking from 16 , and was nominated for the Oxford Poetry Chair at 18 . \nA protge of Northumbrian poet Basil Bunting , he was a regular at the legendary Morden Tower in Newcastle , along with Ted Hughes , Seamus Heaney , Allen Ginsberg and Ed Dorn . \nMacSweeney was a man of contradictions -- a romantic poet , a political journalist and an avid Newcastle United supporter ; vulnerable to harm , but raging against the world ; and an avant-garde writer , but also a naturalist whose writing was rooted in the Northumbrian landscape . \nHis refusal to engage with the establishment was incompatible with commercial or mainstream success , and he died an alcoholic 's death on the poetry fringes . \nHis work has inspired and galvanised a new generation of poets , who view MacSweeney as the lost icon of the counter-culture . \nTo Tom Chivers , he is a hero of the avant-garde , and the man who inspired him to become a poet . \nA 16-year-old Tom encountered MacSweeney at a poetry reading . \nTo his young fan , MacSweeney was terrifying , like a fictional villain , in a long black leather coat and tiny round glasses , and his performance was electric . \nIt would be his last public reading . \nA week later he was dead . \nThis is Tom 's personal journey to explore the man and the poet . \nTravelling to the Northumbrian landscape , the young poet and MacSweeney fanatic rediscovers his lost hero and investigates why his radical style was never palatable to the mainstream . \nHe explores his appeal to a new generation of poets who are rediscovering MacSweeney , drawing from his idiosyncratic style and charismatic performances . \nHe also finds out why , in a poetry scene that is once again revived with unusual use of language and an emphasis on the spoken word , MacSweeney is , for many young writers , the lost rebel who never sold out . \nThe

Monday 7 to Friday 11 September Bernard Herrmann referred to himself simply as a `` composer '' rather than a `` film composer '' . \nAs far as he was concerned the distinction was an important one . \nHe is best remembered for the brilliant film scores he produced , among them Citizen Kane ; the classic Hitchcock thrillers Psycho , North By Northwest , Marnie and Vertigo ; Truffaut 's fantastical Fahrenheit 451 ; and Martin Scorsese 's nightmarish Taxi Driver . \nHe also wrote a cache of chamber , choral and symphonic music , as well as a full-length opera based on Emily Bront 's Wuthering Heights . \nBy all accounts Herrmann was as complex as any of the characters his music illustrated on the silver screen . \nHe could be paranoid , irascible , abrasive and volatile , yet he remained a romantic at heart . \nHe could also be generous and compassionate but , as a perfectionist , perhaps his lot in life was never to be satisfied . \nMany of his professional disappointments resulted from his inability to compromise . \nWuthering Heights was n't produced on stage in his lifetime because he would n't adjust the score . \nIn the end , Herrmann paid for a recording of the complete work . \nIt was the same story when it came to his symphony : written for the concert hall , the conductor Eugene Ormandy offered to program it for the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra with the proviso that Herrmann would agree to some cuts , one might guess Herrman 's answer . \nIn this week 's Composer Of The Week , Donald Macleod explores a life full of contradictions and tensions that were never fully resolved . \nSuzy Klein introduces the final Chamber Prom this year from London 's Cadogan Hall , a tribute to Purcell in his 350th anniversary year , including a delightful sequence of his solo

\nPalestinian-Israeli pianist Saleem Abboud Ashkar is soloist in Mendelssohn 's youthful First Concerto , which the composer completed in just three days at the age of 22 . \nMahler 's 10th Symphony was left unfinished at his death but was triumphantly premired at the 1964 Proms in a `` performing version '' prepared by musicologist Deryck Cooke and Berthold Goldschmidt . \nWritten in the shadows of failing health and a collapsing marriage to his young wife , Alma , Mahler scribbled notes in the margins of the manuscript -- at one point he writes `` to live for you , to die for you '' and over the tender , peaceful ending , when he seems to have come to some resolution , he writes just one word `` Almschi '' -- his nickname for his wife . \nSherlock Holmes is the subject of tonight 's Proms Literary Festival . \nWhy are we still so fascinated by a pipe-smoking detective with a fondness for deductive reasoning ? \nHe first appeared in 1887 , he 's thought to have been born around 1854 and those in the know believe he went to Cambridge , rather than to Oxford , before sharing a room in Baker Street with a certain Doctor Watson . \nHe also had a famous love of the music of Mendelssohn . \nPresenter Matthew Sweet is joined at the Royal College of Music by the author of The Victorians , AN Wilson and Steven Moffatt , co-creator of the BBC 's forthcoming modern-day TV Sherlock . \nBook Of The Week -- William Golding : The Man Who Wrote The Lord Of The Flies Ep 1\\/5 Monday 7 to Friday 11 September This latest edition of Book Of The Week presents the first biography of the publicity shy author whose debut novel was rejected by many publishers before going on to sell more than 20 million copies in the UK alone . \nDrawing on a vast wealth of previously unpublished material in the Golding family archive , the writer and critic John Carey explores the life and career of the self-critical novelist who won the Nobel Prize for Literature . \nCarey 's biography examines Golding 's life and literary output in extensive detail , and draws heavily on a great deal of previously unpublished letters and journals . \nListeners can learn about Golding 's early childhood ; his return to life as a provincial school teacher after being demobbed in 1945 ; the initial failure and subsequent success of his first novel , The Lord Of The Flies ; his frenetic and wildly successful tour of America in 1961 ; Golding 's largely fruitless attempts to research his Booker Prize-winning novel , Rites Of Passage ; and the controversy surrounding his award of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1983 . \nWritten and abridged by John Carey , Emeritus Merton Professor of English Literature at Oxford University and Chief Book Reviewer for The Sunday Times , William Golding -- The Man Who Wrote The Lord Of The Flies is read by Christian Rodska , one of radio 's most accomplished and distinctive voices . \nMonday 7 to Friday 11 September Anna Maxwell Martin and Sharon Gavin star in this week 's new Woman 's Hour Drama offering , written by David and Caroline Stafford . \nAlvy from Ireland and Dorika from Hungary -- both of whom speak excellent English -- are au pairs who meet every day at the One O'Clock Club : a drop-in mother-and-child center . \nThey bond over their mutual condemnation of modern parenting and their feelings of injustice , and each gradually becomes entangled in both the intricacies of the other 's life and in the delusions , hypocrisies and moral turpitude of their employers . \nGradually the lives of the girls and their employers are turned upside down . \nDorika , in her initial wide-eyed innocent phase , wants comfort and security for her family back home on the farm , while Alvy wants money , sex and power -- and will probably get all three if she can stay out of jail . \nAlvy steers Dorika ruinously off the rails , but it is Dorika 's dark secret -- the existence of a handsome illegal-immigrant brother living secretly in her employers ' shed -- that ultimately leads to the breakdown of marriages , livelihoods , law , order and mental health . \nAlvy is played by Sharon Gavin and Dorika by Anna Maxwell Martin . \nBest Friends , today 's Afternoon Play offering , is written by Clara Glynn and stars Shonagh Price , Louise Ludgate and Robin Laing . \nWhen her best friend , Charlotte , is convicted of murder , Sam is determined to turn round what she believes is a miscarriage of justice -- after all , her friend is not the first mother to be wrongly imprisoned for killing her baby . \nWhen Charlotte 's new baby , Emily , dies suddenly at home everyone assumes it is a case of cot death . \nBut , a few days later , Sam gets an early morning call from Charlotte to say she has been arrested and is being charged with murder . \nSam is shocked but totally convinced that it is a terrible mistake and her friend is innocent . \nHowever , the case goes to trial and Charlotte is found guilty of Emily 's murder . \nSam is determined to get her friend out of prison and to right this terrible miscarriage of justice . \nSam works in PR and , with the approval of Charlotte 's husband , David , she mounts a campaign to free Charlotte . \nA new forensic report from a paediatric pathologist is commissioned in the hope it will uncover new evidence , possibly missed by the expert witnesses at the trial . \nBut the new forensic report removes any doubts from the original police forensics . \nSam wonders if Charlotte or her husband might be guilty of the crime , or if there is another explanation . \nAs the truth unfolds Sam faces dilemmas which push her friendship with Charlotte to the limit . \nSam is played by Shonagh Price , Charlotte by Louise Ludgate and David by Robin Laing . \nFive scientists look back to their ancient forebears and examine how much of that early knowledge still stands the test of time , in a new five-part series . \nIn the first program , facial surgeon Iain Hutchison examines the earliest beginnings of nasal surgery . \nHe discovers that the origins lie in a Sanskrit text attributed to Sushruta -- a physician or school of physicians -- working in third or fourth century BC on the banks of the river Ganges . \nAt that time , cutting off the tip of the nose was a form of punishment and a clear badge of shame . \nIain meets Sanskrit expert Dominik Wujastyk at the Wellcome Institute for the History of Medicine to examine one of the early copies of the original text . \nHe finds out that techniques used today using skin flaps from the cheek to reconstruct the nose were devised by Sushruta . \nHowever , it took centuries for this technique to reach Europe where methods were primitive by comparison . \nOther programs in the series explore early Egyptian systems of cooling and temperature control ; Aristotle 's writings on meteorology ; wound healing in Mesopotamian times ; and counting and early equations in Babylonian society . \n11.00-11 .30 pm BBC RADIO 4 -LRB- Schedule update 28 August -RRB- In 1954 , an extraordinary erotic novel was published in Paris . \nThe Story Of O told the tale of female submission and a beautiful Parisian fashion photographer , O , who is blindfolded , chained , whipped , branded , pierced , made to wear a mask and taught to be constantly available for intercourse . \nWritten with an almost hallucinatory erotic intensity , in spare elegant prose , the purity of the writing took the literary world in France by storm and caused a sensation . \nThe author , Pauline Reage , was a pseudonym and many people believed that because of the sexual intensity of the novel , the author could only have been a man . \nRumours circulated for years as to the true identity of the writer , and the secret of exactly who Reage was only came to light in 1994 when British journalist John St Jorre went to interview the author . \nIn this program , writer and former editor of the Erotic Review , Rowan Pelling , goes in search of Reage to find out exactly who she was and why she wrote such a deeply erotic -- and often disturbing -- novel . \nRowan talks to people who knew her and discovers that Reage was , in fact , an impeccably dressed , demure intellectual called Dominique Aury and that she had written the novel as a love letter for her lover . \nPresenter\\/Rowan Pelling , Producers\\/Angela Hind and Martina

the early Norse settlers colonising Orkney in the 8th century . \nIn one of the most virtuosic works in the entire choral repertoire , George Mackay Brown 's poems are set alongside wordless `` seascapes '' , creating an enormously atmospheric piece which vividly conjures up the cold and wet and other hardships endured by the settlers , rowing their longboats across the waters from Scandinavia . \nSightings of whales and fish , waves and birds , culminate -- at landfall -- in a haunting setting of the Lord 's Prayer , sung in the Old Norse of ancient Orkney . \nAlongside this , listeners can hear another piece with powerfully Orcadian roots : Solstice Of Light , for chorus , organ and solo tenor , sung by Ed Lyon , which sets more words by Brown charting the whole history of the Orkney archipelago . \nIt begins as the islands first emerge from seas and ice , then describes the prehistoric builders of cairns and stone circles , the Celtic men and women who bring a religion of dance and light , Viking marauders who murder the islands ' own saint -- Magnus -- and , finally , brings the story into our own times of those who would rape and despoil the Orkneys in search of

programs , specially commissioned to celebrate the tri-centenary of Johnson 's birth , David Nokes , Professor of English at King 's College London and author of a new biography of Johnson ,

rights-related empowerment of black people in the USA and decided to make a stand through his music . \nHis beliefs led to his creation of legendary songs such as Is n't She Lovely , I Wish , Sir Duke and As -- tracks that have inspired a generation of musicians . \nCritical discourse often labels the album `` experimental '' and this collection of funk , soul , fusion and pop requires an element of contextualization for this to be explored . \nSongs In The Key Of Life won four Grammys in 1978 , including Album Of The Year , and featured a wealth of talent , including George Benson , Herbie Hancock , Deniece Williams and Minnie Ripperton . \nThe BBC Proms bicentenary salute to Mendelssohn ends with the BBC Symphony Orchestra , under Ji Blohlvek , performing the magical overture that

a panel of three expert witnesses and the audience is invited to join in the debate , as it 's happening , via texts and emails . \nThis week , Ed and his guests ask whether the UK should stop trying to control immigration . \nPhilippe Legrain has been a special adviser to the World Trade Organisation and an economics correspondent for The Economist . \nHe 's a visiting fellow at the LSE and has published several books as well as many newspaper and magazine articles . \nHe argues that no government , except perhaps North Korea 's , would dream of banning cross-border trade in goods and services , yet it is seen as perfectly reasonable for governments to try to ban the movement across borders of most people who produce goods and services . \n`` Immigrants are not an invading army , '' says Legrain , `` they are mostly people seeking a better life who are drawn to Europe by the huge demand for workers to fill the low-end jobs that our ageing and increasingly wealthy societies rely on , but which our increasingly well-educated and comfortable citizens are unwilling to take . '' \nLegrain 's views are challenged by Sir Andrew Green , Chairman Of Migrationwatch UK ; Ann Cryer , Labor MP for Keighley And Ilkeley ; and Tony Saint , former immigration officer-turned-writer . \nAlso in this series , Ed and his panel of experts ask whether foreign aid does more harm than good and whether the age of consent should be lowered to 13 years old . \nPresenter\\/Edward Stourton ,

pianist and established BBC radio star , Carson was branching out into Shakespearian roles when she got the call from Granada to play the harridan in a hairnet . \nThe genteel Carson became overshadowed by her character and claimed that Ena ultimately destroyed her . \nBut she left a rich legacy -- Ena Sharples was television 's prototype battleaxe and became a touchstone for northern exiles like Melvyn Bragg , Roy Hattersley and Victoria Wood . \nMark came across women like Ena in the brick mill terraces of Bolton where his grandparents lived . \nShe epitomised a particular kind of woman , who dominated life in northern working-class communities . \nContributors include Tony Warren , who not only devised Coronation Street but the character that shaped the series , and Geoffrey Wheeler , who worked with Carson at the BBC . \nHe traces the quickfire delivery of Ena back to the northern music hall tradition . \nMelvyn Bragg talks about how Ena Sharples reflected life

its effects studied in an attempt to find a cure . \nThere was no shortage of applicants and people came back year after year . \nFor some it was a free holiday ; they were unpaid but given `` pocket money '' . \nThe heyday of the Common Cold Unit was in the post-war period . \nDespite the holiday atmosphere , volunteers got a stern lecture and were expelled if rules were broken or they lied about their medical history or age . \nBarry , a union official who likes the sound of his own voice , has been coming to the unit for years . \nWhen his room mate , John , is accused of breaking the 30ft rule , where volunteers are not allowed to get within that distance of anyone other than medical staff and room mates to avoid infection , he is asked to leave by his doctor . \nBut Barry knows that John is innocent and goes into battle for him . \nIt is soon obvious that Barry 's fight with the establishment may be as much to do with his own feelings of insignificance . \nEven if he does n't quite manage a revolution , he does get an apology out of the doctor , and he manages to attract the attentions of Lillian , another outsider at odds with the staff and her own room mate . \nBefore long Barry breaks the 30ft rule himself , but with more pleasurable consequences . \nPaul Reynolds -LRB- Press Gang , Trevor 's World Of Sport and Let Him Have It -RRB- stars as Barry , Michael Fenton

' \nAnd he said , ` He had a reaction . \nHe had a bad reaction , '' ' Mr Alvarez recalled . \nAlso on Wednesday , paramedic Richard Senneff said Dr Murray did not mention he had administered propofol , but said he was treating the singer for dehydration . \nHe said Jackson had looked so pale and gaunt he mistook him for a hospice patient , and did not initially recognize him as the world famous pop music star . \nThe Los Angeles County coroner 's office has ruled the singer died from an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol , found in his body along with a cocktail of other sedatives . \nThe pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ? \n"}

Brown , recorded live in concert for World Routes in the Moroccan city of Agadir , and also features a set from veteran Jamaican reggae singer Max Romeo -- both artists making their debut appearance in Africa . \nThe Timitar Festival in Agadir gives both of these artists a chance to fulfil a dream -- to perform on the continent that both consider their spiritual home . \nWhen Max Romeo released his song Wet Dream in 1969 , the BBC never quite believed his claim that it was about a leaky roof , and the record was famously banned . \nIn the Seventies he moved away from what he called his `` saucy '' songs and became a Rastafarian , writing songs such as War In-a Babylon . \nCarlinhos Brown 's music has its roots in religious music of the African Yoruba deities , but his style ranges far and wide . \nHe is seen as hugely influential in Brazil , not only because of his music , but also because of his work in the favelas of northern Brazil , where he runs a music school . \nLive from the Metropolitan Opera in New York , Adam Fischer conducts Mozart 's Die zauberflte -LRB- The Magic Flute -RRB- , with Nathan Gunn as Papageno , Matthew Polenzani as Tamino and Julia Kleiter as Pamina

way . \nPresented by Margaret Juntwait with guest commentator Ira Siff , there are live backstage interviews with members of the cast during the interval . \nWriter Tahir Shah , who has made Morocco his home for the past six years , journeys deep into the heart of Morocco -- the square Jma el Fna in Marrakech -- in search of its centuries-old primal energy . \nJma el Fna may be a common tourist destination for the international hoards that descend on Marrakech , but it remains a very sacred and special place for Moroccans . \nIn a meditation drawing together the storytellers , transvestite players , boxers , master musicians , cigarette sellers , snake charmers , medicine men and many more , Tahir explores the halkas , or circles , where they gather their crowds to enchant and engage . \nThe sounds of Jma el Fna tell their own story and as Tahir moves between night and day and from circle to circle , he looks for order beneath the apparent chaos ; within it he finds an oral tradition and an ancient life-force defying the onslaught of mass tourism and globalisation . \nHarold Pinter , who went to Turkey with fellow playwright Arthur Miller to protest about the imprisonment and torture of intellectuals In The Ambassador 's Reception presenter Maureen Freely explores a journey to Turkey made by Arthur Miller and Harold Pinter . \nMiller and Pinter went to Turkey in 1985 to protest about the imprisonment and torture of intellectuals . \nThe trip culminated in the pair being thrown out of the American Ambassador 's dinner party held in Arthur Miller 's honor . \nThey were visiting Turkey to draw attention to the limits being set on freedom of expression at that time , and the many writers languishing in prison . \nWriter and journalist Maureen Freely retraces their footsteps across Istanbul into the homes and meeting places of the Turkish literati who , in the Eighties , were oppressed , imprisoned and tortured for their opinions . \nUntil then the world had turned a blind eye to their plight . \nFreely asks if Pinter and Miller 's trip successfully drew attention to a regime that was persecuting its people or if hopes were raised only to be quashed again . \nMaureen hears from painters , writers , and publishers -- those who remember the trip vividly , those who were locked up for speaking their mind and the new generation of authors . \nShe finds out whether Turkey is a better , safer and freer place to be a writer today than it was in the spring of 1985 , or whether having an opinion that deviates from the official line remains a dangerous path to tread . \nRay Quinn stars as James in The Believers by Frank Cottrell Boyce , a comedy drama that follows a Merseybeat Christian pop band . \nSet in the early Sixties , the band , The Believers , grapple with life and love as they seek to spread `` The Word '' . \nBut it would help if they were all singing from the same hymn sheet . \nJames and Billy are nice lads but they do n't really get things together until they meet Debbie in a club . \nShe might not be a `` believer '' but she 's in love with music and has enough drive and ambition for all three of them . \nManaged by the pastor at their local mission hall , The Believers start to make an impression , not least because they have a female drummer . \nThen The Beatles have their first hit and the world goes crazy for the Merseybeat sound . \nThe Believers find themselves as the house band in a gambling dive in Leeds ; a gambling dive that employs attractive young women dressed as rabbits to distract the punters from their inevitable losses . \nCan the band survive this eye-opening plunge into the seamy side of life at a time when the two boys discover a new passion beyond their faith in God ? \nFor James and Billy are both falling in love with Debbie . \nThe Believers also features Samantha Robinson as Debbie , Kieran Lynn as Billy , John Biggins as Warren , Rufus Wright as Reverend Michaels , Gary Bleasdale as Elder Wardle and Alison Pettitt as Jenny . \nOther parts are played by Joanna Monro , David Seddon , Laura Molyneux , Jill Cardo and Keely Beresford . \nThe original music

court outdid everyone else in splendor and power , and one tune caught the imagination of the court composers . \nEarly music specialists Catherine Bott and Andrew Kirkman think the original song may have been a warning against the threat of the warring Turks , following the fall of Constantinople in 1453 . \nBut it could equally have been a popular children 's song or even the name of a pub frequented by some of those composers . \nWhatever its origin , it became the big hit of that time , but then , like much of pop music , it just went out of fashion and disappeared . \nRainer tries to unravel the medieval puzzle , and then find out why the song suddenly burst back into life in the 20th century . \nChristopher Marshall heard it in his New Zealand secondary school and some years later used it as the inspiration for a lively piece for wind band . \nKarl Jenkins was introduced to it during the Kosovo crisis 10 years ago , and composed his popular Mass For Peace . \nRainer traces the journey of the tune and the words -- never far from the constant threat of war , while appearing in completely different musical clothes . \nPresenter\\/Rainer Hersch , Producers\\/Merilyn Harris and Richard Bannerman In this week 's Archive On Four , historian Alan Dein celebrates the centenary of his mentor George Ewart Evans , collector of Suffolk farming tales . \nGeorge Ewart Evans put the village of Blaxhall on the map and created a tradition of oral history in the UK , recording fireside chats . \nHe began by chatting to his neighbors over the fireside in the Fifties and transcribing stories about poaching , shepherding , smuggling and ditching . \nThe talk was of a hardscrabble life , of leaky roofs and meals of pea soup and pollard dumplings and beef only at Christmas , with occasional festivities like the Whitsun fair . \nEvans came from a Welsh mining village and he sympathised with the labourers ' stories about the tyranny of the trinity of parson , squire and farmer . \nHe was a sympathetic listener who allowed his community to speak for itself and he captured the stories of people whose traditions had been unbroken for generations ; who worked on the land before mechanisation ; who believed in magic and folk wisdom ; and who had intuitive understanding of working with animals . \nEvans 's 11 books about the working lives and folk stories of Blaxhall are a portrait of every facet of his village and paved the way for books and programs , both fiction and not fiction , about British agricultural life . \nAlan Dein talks to people who remember Evans in the village of Blaxhall and to his son Lord Evans and youngest daughter Susan , as well as historian Owen Collins . \n12.00noon-7 .00 pm BBC RADIO 5 LIVE Mark Pougatch presents 5

of forbidden love and religious faith set prior to the Second World War . \nThe size and scale of the series was unprecedented . \nTo make 11 50-minute episodes , shot entirely on film and all on

on , however , largely in anthologies or as requests on Poetry Please , and Brian Patten is determined to find out as much as he can about the man who wrote some beautiful poetry about love , cats and , more unusually , Luton . \nFor a man who never found the love of which he dreamed , he was conspicuously tenacious in looking for it , but , as a Tessimond researcher explains in Lost Voices this afternoon , he had a fatal tendency to seek love from unsuitable women -- chorus girls and nightclub hostesses . \nNevertheless , Tessimond is clearly a man who inspired affection and , in the course of the program , Brian himself develops a soft spot for `` Tessy '' . \n12.00noon-6 .00 pm BBC RADIO 5 LIVE Colin Murray presents the latest sports news and an afternoon of live sport . \nFrom 12pm

\nRevelling in a teasing playfulness , the band circle around what seem to be well-known tunes , never quite stating them to the point of recognition . \nIverson and King met as teenagers in Minneapolis . \nIn 2001 , they formed power piano trio The Bad Plus whose head turning renditions of contemporary songs , from Blondie to Nirvana , alongside an impressive catalogue of highly distinctive originals , lifted them onto the international stage . \nCutting their teeth on the New York scene over the last three decades , Tim Berne and Hank Roberts are now elder statesmen of the

middle of nowhere and in need of substantial repair . \nBut that soon becomes the least of their worries as their reception in the local village is , at best , frosty . \nUnsettling things begin to happen around the farm -- graffiti appears on the walls in the dead of night ; supplies are stolen ; and a dead fox is left on the porch . \nDespite their best efforts to fit in , the campaign of

One 's EastEnders to find out what Greek tragedy and soap opera have in common . \nOn the face of it they could n't be more different but , as Natalie discovers , the two forms have rather more in common than stereotype might have people believe . \nSoap and Greek tragedy alike focus relentlessly on families under pressure ; both see it as their job to confront their fellow citizens with social taboos ; and both compete keenly to win the praise of mass audiences . \nNatalie soon finds out that this is no coincidence when she meets John Yorke , former executive producer on EastEnders and now Head of BBC Drama Production ; Dominic Treadwell-Collins , series story producer on EastEnders ; Kara Manley , series story editor on The Bill ; Phil Redmond , the creator of Brookside ; and other soap writers and story-liners who have worked on a wide range of soaps . \nShe discovers that Aeschylus and Sophocles are often present in spirit at script conferences as story teams exhort each other

Springfield , Pat Benatar , Supertramp and more as he continues his journey through the world of Album Orientated Rock -LRB- AOR -RRB- . \nPowered by the West Coast experimental music scene and the release of The Beatles ' Sgt Pepper LP , AOR first burst onto American radio in San Francisco in 1967 . \nIt was a revelation , a tour de force of creative programming which empowered its DJs and provided an antidote to the Top 40 hit radio that just was n't `` hip '' any more . \nBy the mid-Seventies , AOR had become the most successful radio format in America . \nThe A-Z Of AOR plays the biggest hits and the hidden gems from a genre that drove album sales into the triple millions . \nThe Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment -LRB- OAE -RRB- , continuing its complete run of Beethoven

some of the country 's top judges and lawyers discuss legal issues of the day continues . \nThe program explores why certain groups of people , in certain situations , appear to be `` above the law '' : granted immunity from prosecution or civil action . \nMPs facing criminal charges over their expenses , under a legal convention dating back to the 17th century , may be able to argue that their behavior is covered by parliamentary privilege . \nThis is the privilege which allows MPs and peers to make slanderous remarks within the Houses of Parliament without fear of being sued in the civil courts . \nThe panel examines why it is being argued that this might provide a defense from prosecution for criminal offences . \nDiplomatic immunity protects embassy staff from prosecution for any offence , from non-payment of parking fines to murder . \nCrown or state immunity establishes that the sovereign or state can not commit a legal wrong and is immune from civil suit or criminal prosecution . \nBut can this immunity be extended to cover national security agents accused of torture on the grounds that they are `` agents of the state '' or to protect heads of state accused of war crimes or corruption ? \nThis program also discusses immunity from prosecution granted to super-grasses and other defendants who provide evidence to the prosecution . \nThe crew of the RRS James

\n`` I hope each broadcast , through music old and new , familiar and unexpected , proves an enjoyable slice of American Pie , none quite like the 49 others . '' \nPresenter\\/Sir Tim Rice , Producer\\/Anthony Cherry Violist Lawrence Power joins the BBC Scottish SO to perform Mikls Rzsa 's viola concerto In this live concert from City Halls , Glasgow , Alexander Titov conducts the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra in works from Russia and America , beginning with an introduction and interlude from Rimsky-Korsakov 's opera , The Legend Of The Invisible City Of Kitezh , which combines the real and the supernatural , history and myth . \nViolist Lawrence Power joins the orchestra to perform Mikls Rzsa 's Viola Concerto . \nBorn in Hungary , Mikls Rzsa wrote many classical works but went to Hollywood in 1939 to work on film scores and is probably best known for his blockbusters including Ben-Hur and El Cid . \nHis Viola Concerto is one of his final works , written in 1979 for the young Pinchas Zukerman . \nThe least well known of Rachmaninov 's symphonies , the First -- an incredibly powerful work , bursting with youthful energy -- ends this evening 's concert . \nIts premire , when Rachmaninov was only 24 , was famously a disaster and it was never again performed in his lifetime . \nJournalist John Harris investigates the influence of the suburbs and provincial towns on British rock music , from Colchester to Swindon . \nHarris argues that much of the best British music has been rooted in the rather staid environs of the UK 's suburbs and provincial towns , soundtracking a world of privet hedges , caravans parked on driveways and curtain-twitching intrigue . \nIn this feature , he travels to the places where the music was born , talks to the people who created it and places them in a tradition that is too-often ignored . \nIn Swindon , he meets Andy Partridge of the seminal band XTC , who has always insisted on living in a place he knows drives him mad so his creative fires do n't go out . \nIn Colchester , he delves into the experiences essayed by Britpop pioneers Blur and hears from Damon Albarn . \nIn Gants Hill in Essex he meets Louise Wener , former lead singer of Britpop band Sleeper ; in Coventry , he considers the music of The Specials ; in Woking he considers renowned suburban poet Paul Weller ; and , in the unexpected rock hotbed of Bromley , he tells the stories of a handful of local suburban `` refuseniks '' , including David Bowie and Siouxsie Sioux . \nTo show that the tradition is still continuing , he speaks to the band Good Shoes and considers their track about living in Morden . \nAlong the way , there are flashbacks to non-musical stuff on which some of these songwriters have drawn : John Betjeman 's TV documentary Metro-Land , and such poems as Slough and Middlesex ; Philip Larkin 's I Remember , I Remember , which is set in Coventry ; and George Orwell 's classic suburban novel Coming Up For Air . \nThe Disappearance , by Peter Whalley , is a psychological thriller with fraudulent identity at its heart . \nAlice moves into a converted Victorian house and rents the top floor . \nThe landlord lives below . \nBoth tenant and landlord are not who they say they are , and as each discovers the truth , it is clear one of them is going to die . \nWhen Alice moves into the property it 's fairly obvious that the young landlord fancies her . \nShe quickly befriends him . \nBut her actions seem to over-step the boundary of safe behavior and , when she tells the landlord that she knows he 's not the real owner , he confesses to the secret fraud . \nThen a letter of inheritance arrives for the real owner and the tenant and the landlord undertake a heist . \nBut Alice is hiding a bigger secret . \nShe 's on a quest for revenge ... The Disappearance features Lee Ingleby as Martin , Joanne Froggatt as Alice and Becky Hindley as Denise . \nArthur Smith presents comedy , music and entertainment from his Balham flat . \nIn the first

{"id": "253", "time": "2011-11-29", "text": "By David Willis BBC News , Los Angeles Conrad Murray closes his eyes after he is sentenced There were several things that divided them throughout their client 's six-week trial . \nBut the issue that caused the most disagreement between the two key members of Dr Conrad Murray 's legal team was the question of whether the defendant himself should testify on his own behalf . \nMurray 's pugnacious Texas-based lead counsel , Ed Chernoff , was adamant Murray should not take the stand . \nHe feared the case raised so many unanswered questions it would be `` open season '' for the prosecution when the time came to cross-examine the physician . \nHis flaxen-haired co-counsel Michael Flanagan disagreed . \nAs the trial progressed and the evidence against Murray mounted , Mr Flanagan became convinced his client 's only chance of acquittal lay in giving his own version of events . \nAs he told the magazine Texas Lawyer shortly after Murray was convicted : `` The elephant in the room was the need for the doctor to explain what he did . '' \nAnything over a couple of dollars he is simply not going to have the ability to pay '' End Quote Michael Flanagan Conrad Murray 's co-counsel It was something Murray himself had clearly been weighing up right until the very last minute . \nAs the defense moved to rest its case . \nJudge Michael Pastor reminded the doctor of his right to take the stand and asked him directly whether he wished to reconsider . \nMurray looked at Mr Flanagan and Mr Chernoff in turn and then paused for what seemed like an eternity before replying , `` no '' . \nThat he chose to break his silence in a documentary broadcast on the American network MSNBC just a few days after being found guilty clearly irritated Judge Pastor . \nBut it was the program 's contents that left the judge almost incandescent . \nFar from appearing remorseful about what had happened to Michael Jackson , Murray almost seemed to regard himself as the victim , declaring defiantly : `` I do n't feel guilty , because I did n't do anything wrong . '' \nMurray passed up a final chance to address the court minutes before his sentencing . \nThe judge said the documentary interview was ultimately what persuaded him against granting the accused probation , thereby paving the way to a maximum sentence of four years in prison . \nJackson 's family is pushing for the astonishing sum of more than $ 100m Mr Flanagan said afterwards that while the judge would have wanted to hear from Murray it was probably too late by then to affect the outcome . \n`` The die was cast a long time ago , '' said the lawyer , ruefully . \nIt seems unlikely that either Mr Flanagan or Mr Chernoff will be back in court for a hearing at the end of January to determine how much Murray will have to pay by way of restitution to Michael Jackson 's estate . \nThe tension between Mr Flanagan and Mr Chernoff - which even surfaced in that controversial documentary - is one reason they are both reported to be keen to put the Conrad Murray case behind them . \nJackson 's family is pushing for the astonishing sum of more than $ 100m -LRB- # 64m -RRB- . \nThey say that is what he stood to make from the This Is It concerts at London 's O2 arena . \nJackson had been rehearsing for a series of concerts in London But the fact of the matter is this : Conrad Murray was heavily in debt when he went to work for Michael Jackson , and since Jackson died before he could repay those debts Mr Flanagan believes the family will be lucky to see much of it . \n`` Anything over a couple of dollars he is simply not going to have the ability to pay , '' he said . \nAnd then there is the question of the lawyer 's own remuneration . \nThe Texas Lawyer article revealed that it had `` not been equal to the task '' and quoted Ed Chernoff as saying : `` If Dr Murray had paid me a quarter-of-a-million dollars it -LRB- would have been -RRB- entirely too little considering the amount of work that was involved and the collateral issues that were attached . '' \nThe only upside being that - given the high profile nature of the case - future generations of law students may well end up mulling their arguments and discussing their testimony and wondering , perhaps , whether things might have been different had Murray taken the stand . \nThe pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ? \n"}

'' \nDr Murray did not give evidence during his six-week trial , which ended on Monday when a jury ruled he had given Jackson a fatal overdose of propofol . \nHe spoke to journalist Steve Hewlett eight days before the verdict as part of a documentary called The Man Who Killed Michael Jackson . \nThe pop star 's family have complained about the program , which is due to be screened in the US next week . \nunder the title Michael Jackson and the Doctor : A Fatal Friendship . \nThe executors of the pop star 's estate said Murray was getting a primetime platform to smear Jackson 's reputation without fear of cross-examination , and demanded that the screening be canceled . \n`` Like so many of Michael 's fans , the estate is ... disgusted by MSNBC 's irresponsible and inexplicable decision to air a Conrad Murray ` documentary ' , '' it said . \nAsked about Jackson 's use of propofol , Dr Murray said : `` I did not recommend it . \nI would never have recommended propofol to Mr Jackson '' . \n`` He needed to get rid of it and resume a more normal state of sleep . '' \nUsing an analogy to explain his actions , he told Mr Hewlett : `` If I came to your house and you were a friend of mine and unexpectedly I saw you with a gun in your hand , I can do one of two things and maybe succeed . \n`` I can tell you stop it and you might listen to me , or I might take hours to get you to hand over that gun . \nSo I would say , basically , it took me a while to take away from Michael something I thought he should not use . '' \nDescribing the night when Jackson died , Dr Murray accounted for his actions in the one hour and 40 minutes between administering propofol and the emergency services being called . \nHe said he had sat with Jackson , checking his vital signs until he believed the effects of the sedative had worn off , before moving to an adjacent room at 11:20 am . \n`` If you say : ` Dr Murray , that was really stupid , you should have had a look , ' then I agree , '' he said . \nDr Murray added that he had not informed police or the ambulance crew that Jackson had taken the drug because `` they never asked me '' and `` I did not think it was important '' . \nThe prosecution said Murray had caused Jackson 's death through negligence His comments echoed a similar interview given to the US breakfast television show Today earlier this week . \n`` I think propofol is not recommended to be given in the home setting , '' Dr Murray said during the interview . \n`` But it is not contraindicated . '' \nIn court , the defense argued that Jackson was a drug addict who caused his own death by giving himself an extra dose of propofol while the cardiologist was out of the room at the star 's rented Los Angeles mansion . \nMurray told Today 's Savannah Guthrie he had not been distracted by phone calls , emails and text messages . \n`` When I looked at a man who was all night deprived of sleep , who was desperate for sleep and finally is getting some sleep , am I gonna sit over him , sit around him , tug on his feet , do anything unusual to wake him up ? \nNo , '' Murray said . \nAsked if he was right to leave Jackson alone , he replied : `` Had I known what I know today in retrospect , that Mr Jackson was an addict - and he had shared that information with me - addicts may behave in a way that is unreasonable and you may consider it . '' \nDr Murray , 58 , is due to be sentenced on 29 November and could receive a maximum prison term of four years and lose his licence to practice medicine . \nThe pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ? \n"}

Valery Gergiev and the London Symphony Orchestra perform the scintillating ballet score for The Firebird , which Stravinsky wrote 100 years ago for Diaghilev 's Ballets Russes . \nBased on the Russian folktale of the exotic Firebird imprisoned by the evil magician Kashchey , the work made him famous overnight . \nScriabin too was nothing if not ambitious : in his Symphony No. 1 in E major he began his symphonic output with a massive work in six movements , complete with a choral finale in praise of art and including two solo vocal roles , taken tonight by members of Gergiev 's Mariinsky Theatre . \nThis Prom is repeated on Monday 23 August at 2pm . \nSusan Hitch explores the life and work of Boris Pasternak , Nobel Prize-winning poet and author , who died 50 years ago . \nHer guests on stage at the Proms Literary Festival are Jonathan Myerson , who dramatised Dr Zhivago for the BBC , and Professor of Russian Donald Rayfield . \nPasternak is most famous in the UK for his sprawling epic novel Dr Zhivago which sets the concerns , desires and stories of individuals in the vast landscape of Russian revolutionary politics and history . \nSusan and guests discuss the circumstances of the book 's publication : it was smuggled out of Russia during the height of the Cold War , and the subsequent film adaptation by David Lean made Pasternak a global literary hero . \nBut does that tell the real story of Pasternak ? \nMyserson and Rayfield explore the misunderstood complexity of the novel , and the fact that the compromises Pasternak adopted in his life mean he 's no straightforward Cold War darling of the West . \nThis week in The Essay , scientists revisit mould-breaking experiments in history . \nToday , biologist Matthew Cobb ruminates on the quest for spontaneously generated

, but also laid the foundations of modern ideas of continuous heredity in all life . \nMonday 16 to Friday 20 August Stuart Kelly examines the powerful images of Scotland created by Sir Walter Scott . \nHis name , image and influence can be seen everywhere , from Scottish banknotes to place names across the globe . \nSir Walter Scott invented the modern novel , began Scotland 's tourist industry and was the first celebrity author . \nLauded by contemporary critics and his impressive readership in the 19th century , today he is hardly ever read . \nStuart examines Scott 's contradictory legacy as best-selling bankrupt , iconic unknown and the Tory defender of the Union who fought to save Scotland 's banking independence . \nStuart considers the influential images of his own country created by Scott -- the stereotype of the kilted native dwelling within rugged , romantic landscapes -- images that haunt Scotland to this day . \nStuart was born and grew up in the Scottish Borders . \nHe studied English at Oxford and is the literary editor of Scotland on Sunday . \nThe book is abridged by Laurence Wareing . \nPresenter\\/Stuart Kelly , Producer\\/Eilidh McCreadie for the BBC Monday 16

they mark them . \nIn this program , Imogen goes on a quest to discover what the magic ingredient is to achieve the new A \\* and talks to teachers , pupils and examiners on her journey . \nAdam and Trevor both agree to sit one A-level Shakespeare exam question to see how they get on when they have it graded by a genuine examiner who does not know who they are . \nPresenter\\/Imogen Stubbs ,

for the BBC Mike Thomson returns for a new series of BBC Radio 4 's investigative history program which examines documents that shed new light on past events . \nThe series begins with a paper trail surrounding an oil disaster -- not the most recent example in the Gulf of Mexico but one much closer to home , in the North Sea . \nWhile President Obama has told BP that it will be held fully responsible for cleaning up the damage caused by the massive oil spill off the American coast , papers seen by Document show that the oil company Occidental got off far more lightly after the Piper Alpha disaster in 1988 off the Scottish coast , which left 167 people dead . \nAfter seeing the recently released documents , the environmental pressure group Greenpeace claims too little was done to deal with more than five tons of highly toxic chemicals released in the disaster . \nThe documents also shed light on the decision to topple the remains of the Piper Alpha platform , an operation that threatened to worsen contamination and was fiercely opposed by relatives who wanted the search for bodies to continue . \nMike speaks to marine biologists , politicians from the time and survivors to find out if more should have been done to clean up after the disaster . \nPresenter\\/Mike Thomson , Producer\\/Julia Johnson for the BBC 7.00-10 .30 pm BBC RADIO 5 LIVE Mark Chapman is live from Old

violence in favor of dialogue with other faiths . \nTheir objective is to reconcile Islam with modernity . \nBut its leadership remains deeply conservative . \nCritics say its world view makes it an

August at 2.45 pm on Radio 3 . \nListeners are invited to join Andrew McGregor as we step inside the bow maker 's workshop , following the master craftsman who needs to be engineer , woodcarver and silversmith . \nTwenty Minutes reveals how precision and technical skill are only the foundation of the art and examines the modern-day issues facing bow makers -- such as how Pernambuco , a rare Brazilian hardwood which has been used in the making of string bows for more than 250 years , has been driven to the point of extinction . \nWith insights from violinists Rachel Podger and Daniel Hope , listeners discover the difference a good bow can make and how the bow continues to evolve today . \nThe thoughtful , dignified , spacious music of Estonian composer Arvo Prt has become one of the most distinctive sounds in contemporary music . \nThis evening 's Late Night Prom presents a performance of a choral work which summarises his unassuming and deceptively simple style -- a setting of the Christian Passion narrative from the Gospel according to St John . \nPrt 's St John Passion is not a work in which the harrowing events of Christ 's arrest , trial , crucifixion and death are used as the vehicle for large-scale , overly dramatic musical gestures . \nRather , the piece makes its impact through quiet understatement and ritualised intensity -- the music only occasionally raising its voice . \nIn a noisy , over-emotionalised , hyper-sensitive contemporary world Prt 's piece takes listeners to a place of deep contemplation and solemn ceremony -- sounding both fresh and modern , and -- at the same time -- as if it springs from some great well of primeval music . \nThe concert features the BBC Singers with tenor Andrew Kennedy as Pilate and baritone Brindley Sherratt as Jesus , Iain Farrington is the organist and David Hill the conductor . \nQuentin Letts returns with another series of What 's The Point Of ... offering a witty and thought-provoking look at some of Britain

. \nAs the nation commemorates the 70th anniversary of the Battle of Britain , Quentin asks whether we still need an independent air force in 2010 . \nBritain was the first country in the world to have an independent air force , so to even consider eradicating it would be unthinkable , surely . \nDefense secretary Liam Fox has promised that the government 's strategic defense review will be ruthless and unsentimental . \nThe RAF 's critics claim that a bloated higher command structure in Whitehall argues for unaffordable fast jets for a war the country wo n't be fighting . \nAnd many say its uniforms are horrible and they ca n't march properly ! \nHistorian Max Hastings , war correspondent Sam Kiley , former defense secretary Geoff Hoon and retired colonel Tim Collins are among those who join Quentin to ask the question , what is the point of the RAF ? \nPresenter\\/Quentin Letts , Producer\\/Rosemary Dawson for the BBC Dr Hilary Jones explores the history of obesity , from the fairground to the tabloids . \nThe media , government and medical reports all over the world echo the same sentiment -- the obesity epidemic has arrived . \nBut obesity is as old as mankind . \nIn this series , Dr Hilary looks back into its history , and asks what can be learned today from the mistakes and successes of overweight ancestors . \nThe series starts with an investigation of the immensely corpulent individuals who put themselves on show to the public . \nIt begins in Stamford -- scene of the death and extraordinary burial of Daniel Lambert , hailed in 1809 as `` the most corpulent man in the history of the world '' . \nProfessor Vanessa Toulmin of the National Fairground Archive and Professor David Haslam , chair of the National Obesity Forum , explore the world of circus obese folk . \nAnd from America , listeners can hear a snatch of the Strates Carnival in 1941 , featuring Big Bertha and Slim Jim , `` the world 's strangest married couple '' . \nTimes have changed , and nowadays the idea of obese individuals exhibiting in freak shows is highly uncomfortable . \nBut is the portrayal of obesity in sensationalist , prurient tabloid articles and on TV , the modern-day equivalent of the freak show ? \nOther programs in the series explore depictions of obesity in art , music and literature ; diets through the ages ; and the weird , wonderful and downright dangerous obesity remedies of the past . \nPresenter\\/Dr Hilary Jones , Producer\\/Susan Kenyon for Ladbroke Productions In the final program of In Living Memory , Jolyon Jenkins explores the rise of the ostrich investment mania of the Nineties -- and why it all went so badly wrong . \nIn the mid-Nineties , companies sprung up offering huge returns on ostrich farming . \nOstrich fever took hold , and birds changed hands at 10 times their true market value . \nIt seemed too good to be true -- and it was . \nThe Department of Trade moved in and closed down the companies on the grounds that that they were running pyramid schemes . \nIn the case of the biggest company , the Ostrich Farming Corporation , an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office revealed that the directors had also been siphoning off millions of pounds into offshore accounts , and three directors went to prison . \nIn this program , Jolyon tries to discover why so many apparently intelligent people fell for the ostrich scams . \nHe discovers what happened to the ostriches when the Ostrich Farming Corporation collapsed , and he follows the fortunes of the two companies , each run by retired military officers , which were set up to try to carry on ostrich farming . \nPresenter and Producer\\/Jolyon Jenkins for the BBC Sheila McClennon discovers how a tiny venue in a converted Paris chapel became one of the most popular and infamous venues in the country 's theatrical history . \nAt the end of the 19th century , in the seediest quarter of Paris , a new theater opened its doors offering a recipe of blood and terror . \nSoon the Grand Guignol was to become as big an attraction in the city as the Eiffel Tower and the Arc de Triomphe . \nThe success of an evening 's performance -- made up of a succession of short comedy and horror plays -- was measured by how many members of the audience fainted , as they witnessed gougings , garrottings and gory murders on a nightly basis . \nAfter more than 60 years the theater finally closed its doors , but only after helping influence the development of horror in the cinema , as well as introducing the phrase Grand Guignol into common parlance as a byword for shocking , blood-soaked terror . \nIn this program , Sheila visits Paris to revisit the scene of this most shocking of theater movements , she also goes to London to find out how the likes of Joseph Conrad and Noel Coward got involved in its English incarnation , which fought a staunch but unsuccessful battle with the censors at the beginning of the Twenties . \nPresenter\\/Sheila McClennon , Producer\\/Geoff Bird for the BBC Professor Robert Winston concludes his exploration of the relationship between the music and medical conditions of composers who suffered mental and physical illness . \nPeter Warlock was the pseudonym of Philip Heseltine , a troubled British composer who died of apparent suicide in 1930 . \nProfessor Winston wades through the many colorful and outrageous episodes in his life to investigate if the apparent `` Jekyll and Hyde '' quality in his character and his music was the result of a serious psychological condition . \nPresenter\\/Professor Robert Winston , Producer\\/Chris Taylor for the BBC Michael Butt 's innovative drama delves into one of most illusive events in English literary history -- the killing of the playwright Christopher Marlowe in May 1593 . \nThis drama dons the cloak of documentary to get into the heart of the Elizabethan plot . \nThe story is told through first-hand testimonies and interviews and explores the anatomy of a killing through the eyes of the witnesses . \nThe scene is Deptford on 30 May 1593 . \nFour gentlemen enter a tavern . \nThey order lunch , take a room above the public bar and ask for privacy . \nThe official story was that a fight resulted after an argument regarding the bill . \nAll four gentlemen dealt in the perennial currency of that day : bargains , tricks , betrayals and lies . \nThe narrator opens the play while crouching next to Marlowe 's dead body , now growing cold . \nOver the next 45 minutes he speaks to the people who knew Marlowe and enters a world of half-truths and outright lies , as he tries to elicit answers that will finally lead to the truth . \nThe cast stars Paul Rhys as Narrator , Blake Ritson as Thomas Walsingham , Harry Lloyd as Thomas Kyd , Burn Gorman as Robert Poley , Tim McMullan as Lord Cecil , Christine Kavanagh as Mrs Bull , Tony Bell as Ingram Frizer , Sam Dale as Richard Baines , Sean Baker as Cambridge Porter and Lloyd Thomas as Drew

in which thoughts of that all important first kiss occupy the mind of a teenager as she travels home from school on the bus . \nKiss is read by Morven Christie . \nReaders\\/Julia McKenzie , Laurel Lefkow and Morven Christie , Producer\\/Gemma Jenkins for the BBC Disgraced American President Richard Nixon Matthew Parris invites historian Dominic Sandbrook to explain why the life of disgraced American President Richard Nixon is , to him , a great one . \nThe disgrace and resignation of Richard Nixon in 1974 was a profoundly traumatic moment in the history of the American presidency , leaving the world with the endlessly influential word `` Watergate '' and a cynicism about politics that arguably has only now , with Barack Obama , started to heal . \nHence Nixon 's life is perhaps a strange one to nominate as `` great '' , but Dominic unhesitatingly selects him for celebration in this program . \nMatthew talks to him about his intriguing choice , and calls on Professor Philip Davies of the Eccles Centre for American Studies to fill out the picture . \nPresenter\\/Matthew Parris , Producer\\/Christine Hall for the BBC Tim McInnerny and Andrew Sachs star in a comedy about the staff of an antiques shop , in the final part of the BBC Radio and Television collaboration showcasing new comedy pilots . \nSassy , cutting , clever , perceptive and in desperate need of a job , Faye Chambers is new to the team . \nShe joins Rupert Bull , an old school bounder and cad who has somehow managed to survive into the 21st century , and Toby Atkins , his useless but enthusiastic assistant manager . \nRupert won the shop in a poker competition many years ago , and sees it as little more than a way to make a fast buck . \nIn this pilot episode , the immeasurably lovely local shop-owner Mr Richards has a set of priceless Faberg eggs that need restoring . \nWritten by John-Luke Roberts and Gareth Gwynn , the cast features Tim McInnerny as Rupert Bull , William Andrews as

interview with the Carolina Chocolate Drops and music from their album Genuine Negro Jig . \nBased in Durham , North Carolina , the Carolina Chocolate Drops are a rare thing in 2010 : an African-American old-time string band . \nFormed in 2005 by three young multi-instrumentalists -- Rhiannon Giddens , Dom Flemons and Justin Robinson -- the Drops perform traditional music from the Piedmont region of the Carolinas , as well as string band versions of 21st-century hits . \nThe three members first met via an internet group and went on to visit and learn from old `` black fiddler '' Joe Thompson , who passed on to them tunes that had been in his family for generations . \nTheir name is a nod to Thirties African-American country blues band the Tennessee Chocolate Drops .

Atkinson for Smooth Operations Legendary Welsh film star Richard Burton BBC Radio 2 takes another trip to the movies this summer , profiling further luminaries of the silver screen . \nThe first actor in the spotlight in the BBC Radio 2 At The Movies season is the late , great Richard Burton . \nMichael Sheen grew up in the shadow of the steel and coal industries of South Wales , but there was another towering figure in his youth as he started showing signs of what was to become a glittering acting career . \nThat figure was his fellow South Walian Richard Burton . \nRich , as he was known to his friends , was one of the world 's richest and most famous men in his day . \nBut above all else , he was a proud Welshman and an actor of extraordinary power , both on stage and on screen . \nAnd then of course there were the exploits beyond drama . \nHis marriage to Elizabeth Taylor dominated the tabloids of the Sixties and his reputation as a drinker is legendary . \nIn this program Michael looks back at the Burton legacy with the help of a selection of family , friends and colleagues , including Burton 's last wife Salley ; his nephew Guy Masterson ; his close friend Robert Hardy ; his biographer Melvyn Bragg ; and film critic Barry Norman . \nAnd there 's also plenty of the man himself , with that extraordinary voice -- suffused with `` coal dust and rain '' , according to Burton himself . \nMichael aims to measure how much of Burton 's life and work still resonates today , be it the stage performances that entranced audiences ; the films ; or the myth he made , including the grand passion with Taylor for which he sacrificed a family and became pursued by paparazzi . \nBut the Burton legacy may be at its most lasting in his championing of the people he revered above all others . \nA copy of Shakespeare 's plays was always at his side , and he cherished poets : Hopkins , Donne and , perhaps above all others , his friend Dylan Thomas . \nOne of the greatest treasures in the BBC archive is Under Milk Wood and there , beguiling listeners , is the Burton voice at its very best . \nPresenter\\/Michael Sheen , Producer\\/Tom Alban for the BBC After a dramatic overture by Beethoven , depicting the heroic Roman general Coriolanus , the orchestra focuses on music from its homeland . \nRachmaninov is a composer close to the heart of soloist Nikolai Lugansky , who performs the radiant and inventive piano variations Rhapsody On A Theme Of Paganini . \nTchaikovsky 's orchestral Suite No. 3 in G major was initially conceived as a symphony , but he found this form to be more flexible , and he also included a set of flamboyant variations at the end . \nThis Prom will be repeated on Wednesday 1 September at 2.40 pm . \nStephen Fry investigates whether men and women really use and understand language differently , as his series exploring the highways and byways of the English language continues . \nAs a former presenter on Woman 's Hour , Sue MacGregor has a unique insight into the way men used to use language to patronise or dominate , and recalls one of her guests on the program referring to her as `` my dear '' . \nBut as women began to win equality there was a genuine need to discover whether and how women and men differed in the way they spoke . \nThis program tries to uncover the truth , with the aid of academics , a sex change surgeon , a speech therapist and a bit of comedy from Ronnie Barker . \nPresenter\\/Stephen Fry , Producer\\/Ian Gardhouse for Testbed Productions Edward Stourton revisits a debate from the archives about the origins of the Second World War , as he continues his series reconsidering passionate broadcast debates of the Sixties and Seventies and exploring the ideas , the great minds behind them and echoes of the arguments in present-day politics . \nFrom 1961 , historians AJP Taylor and Hugh Trevor-Roper engage in a fiery confrontation over the origins of the Second World War . \nAJP Taylor and Hugh Trevor-Roper were two big-name historians and the `` telly dons '' of their time . \nIn 1961 the fall-out from the war was still fresh in the minds of the British people . \nTaylor had just published his provocative revision of the orthodox view of the causes of the war in 1939 -- that Britain had scuppered a lunatic dictator 's plans for world domination . \nTaylor argued , instead , that Hitler was a rational statesman who carried out the expected foreign policies of any German leader , and that a war against Britain and France was unintended . \nIn the studio dissecting the debate is Adam Sisman , biographer of both AJP Taylor and Hugh Trevor-Roper , and Richard Evans , regius professor of Modern History at Cambridge . \nPresenter\\/Edward Stourton , Producer\\/Dominic Byrne for Blakeway Productions Claudia Hammond presents more case studies that help unravel the mysteries of the human mind . \nToday 's program details the remarkable case of a young boy who underwent a gender reassignment operation . \nJanet and Ron Reimer 's twin sons , Bruce and Brian , were born in Winnipeg in Canada in August 1965 . \nAll went well until April 1966 , when the twins were circumcised . \nIn the process , Bruce suffered a catastrophic injury to his penis . \nA year later , on the advice of Dr John Money , founder of the Gender Identity Clinic at Johns Hopkins University Medical Centre in Baltimore , Bruce became Brenda and the Reimers began to raise their son as a daughter . \nYet by the time Brenda was a teenager she was suicidal . \nWhen her parents finally told her the truth , Brenda decided to change back to her original gender ; she became David Reimer . \nAs a man , David appeared finally to have found happiness in marriage and stepchildren . \nHowever , a series of events took their toll : his twin brother 's death , the loss of his job and separation from his wife all proved too much and he took his own life on 4 May 2004 . \nPresenter\\/Claudia Hammond , Producer\\/Marya Burgess for the BBC Alistair McGowan stars as a late-night BBC Radio 4 continuity announcer in this subversive new sitcom . \nA continuity announcer 's booth can be a lonely place -- especially on the late shift , when you 've barely seen your wife and children for a week . \nBut this Radio 4 continuity announcer is a consummate professional , and he

and Harry Davidson , who became better known as a dance band leader , plays one of the few installations in the UK by the Dutch firm Standaart at The Commodore Theatre in Hammersmith . \nThe Wurlitzer at Blackpool 's Tower Ballroom has been active since 1935 and is the only organ in the program which can still be heard live today . \nIt 's played by Reginald Dixon , who recorded hundreds of 78s at its famous console . \nBefore 1941 Sidney Torch regularly displayed his mastery of the theater organ , demonstrating a technical expertise that was second to none . \nAfter that he hardly ever touched it as he embarked on a glittering career as an orchestral conductor , composer and arranger , but tonight 's program ends with his creation around the song There 's Something About A Soldier played on the Christie Organ at the Regal , Marble Arch , London . \nPresenter\\/Nigel Ogden , Producer\\/Terry Carter for the BBC Frank Renton presents the Carlton Main Frickley Colliery Band , conducted by Phillip McCann , performing music specially recorded for the program . \nThe band features star cornetist Kirsty Abbotts and their tuba talent Ben Dixon . \nThey perform music by John Williams , an excerpt from Swan Lake and some classic Salvation Army sounds arranged by William Himes . \nPresenter\\/Frank Renton , Prouducer\\/Terry Carter for the BBC Sir Tim Rice celebrates Arkansas , the `` Natural State '' , as he continues to celebrate the musical heritage of the United States . \nTonight there 's music from Johnny Cash , Louis Jordan And His Tympany Five , Ketty Lester , Little Willie John , Al Green , Jerry Keller , Junior Walker And The All Stars , Michelle Shocked with Alison Krauss and Ne-Yo . \nPresenter\\/Sir Tim Rice , Producers\\/Anthony Cherry and Ruth Beazley for the BBC Michael Buerk talks to Romy Tiongco about his choice to risk his life challenging corruption in the Philippines , as the series exploring the processes behind his guests ' life-altering decisions continues . \nRomy fought against poverty and corruption before leaving to live in Britain with his wife . \nUpon his return to the Philippines he found himself drawn back into a dangerous and murky world which presented him with the most difficult choice of his life . \nAfter Romy 's best friend was killed , people called upon him to challenge corruption by standing for political office -- a decision that would put his own life on the line . \nRomy talks to Michael about the dilemmas he faced and how he came to make his decision . \nPresenter\\/Michael Buerk , Producer\\/Amanda Hancox for the BBC David Bowie 's mythical rock star Ziggy Stardust was inspired by British-born singer Vince Taylor , as Martyn Day discovers in this documentary . \nZiggy Stardust was a rock 'n' roll fantasy . \nBut David Bowie 's fictional rock star , around whom his 1972 album , stage show and film were built , was inspired by a real performer : Vince Taylor , born in Isleworth , Middlesex . \nVince Taylor made a name for himself in the early days of rock 'n' roll in London and , later , France . \nThis program uncovers the truth about a singer whose wild lifestyle ultimately destroyed him , but in so doing gave rise to a myth that transcended glam rock and science fiction . \nHis record Brand New Cadillac remains to this day a British rock 'n' roll classic , covered later by The Clash . \nBut Vince was frustrated by his limited success in Britain and , already displaying the unpredictable behavior and volcanic temper that were to dog him for the rest of his days , moved to France where he was dubbed Le diable noir -- the Black Devil . \nDecked out in black leathers , chains , kohl eye make-up and with his hair greased up into a high pompadour , he was immediately signed to the French Barclay label . \nBut , fuelled by alcohol and drugs , Vince 's behavior became increasingly erratic . \nAt a party he tried LSD for the first time . \nIn his state of mind at the time it was the last thing that he needed . \nVince Taylor underwent a kind of public breakdown at his next gig , where he started claiming he was a divine being . \nDavid Bowie bumped into him in London and later said : `` Vince Taylor was the inspiration for Ziggy ... he always stayed in my mind as an example of what can happen in rock 'n' roll . \nI 'm not sure if I held him up as an idol or as something not to become . \nThere was something very tempting about him going completely off the edge . '' \nThe program , presented by Martyn Day , tracks down many of the people who worked with Taylor , including members of his original band and his family . \nPresenter\\/Martyn Day , Producer\\/Bob Dickinson for the BBC Poet Paul Farley investigates the compulsion of some men to collect wild birds ' eggs . \nPaul went `` egging '' as a boy , guarding his guilty secret until now . \nHe examines what the attraction is and how some men never outgrow it , even if egging lands them in prison . \nGenerations of boys have robbed nests during their childhoods . \nMost grow out of it , making a moral journey towards a less rapacious relationship with the natural world . \nBut some do n't , and this can have terrible consequences for both birds and men : the red-backed shrike became extinct in Britain because its beautiful speckled eggs proved irresistible to collectors . \nThis happened as recently as the Eighties , even though it has been illegal to steal eggs from nests since 1954 . \nPunishment then was limited to a fine , related to the offender 's ability to pay , but the law was no deterrent to people such as Colin Watson . \nHe offended repeatedly , paid fines totalling # 6,000 and was once caught trying to fell a tree with a chainsaw to get at an osprey 's nest . \nHe tumbled from a tree while trying to reach a nest in 2005 , and died , killed by his obsession . \nIn 2001 a change in the law meant egg collectors faced prison . \nSeveral were apprehended in Operation Easter by detectives from the National Wildlife Crime Unit . \nIt is now pursuing 70 suspected collectors in Britain and is liaising with Interpol ; as Alan Stewart of Tayside Police reveals , cheap flights have led to `` egg-collecting tourism '' . \nMark Thomas , investigation officer with the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds , believes that while the recent sentences are significant , they are not doing enough . \nPaul Farley talks to those involved on both sides of the law , including John Dodsworth , who has a number of convictions relating to egg collecting . \nHe speaks about his passion and his love of nature , and says that he feels he has done no harm and has been treated unjustly . \nFarly visits the headquarters of the RSPB where Mark Thomas shows him some of the confiscated egg collections , which include red-backed shrike eggs . \nHere he reads the journals of Colin Watson . \nPresenter\\/Paul Farley , Producer\\/Julian May for the BBC 7.00-10 .30 pm BBC RADIO 5 LIVE Eleanor Oldroyd has the latest sports news and , from 8pm , live athletics from the

with the UK premire of his Fourth Symphony , plus classics by Ravel , Scriabin and Mosolov . \nEsa-Pekka Salonen has been principal conductor of the Philharmonia Orchestra for less than two years , but his distinctive programming and conducting has already made its mark on London 's concert life , and their BBC Prom together epitomises their relationship . \nIt starts with a bang -- Alexander Mosolov 's futuristic aural picture of industrial Twenties Soviet Russia in The Foundry -- and continues with a UK premire from Estonian composer Arvo Prt -- his Symphony No. 4 , Los Angeles , bringing to a climax the BBC Proms celebrations of his 75th birthday . \nTwo early 20th-century classics complete the program : Ravel 's remarkable piano concerto for the left hand only , with Jean-Efflam Bavouzet as soloist , and a sensual orchestral showpiece from Scriabin -- The Poem Of Ecstasy . \nThis Prom will be broadcast on BBC Four at 7.30 pm tonight , and is repeated on BBC Radio 3 on Thursday 26 August at 2.45 pm . \nBefore Ravel 's Concerto For The Left Hand in tonight 's BBC Prom concert , novelist Louise Doughty investigates the influence left-handedness has on creativity , including her own . \nAfter losing his right hand in the First World War pianist Paul Wittgenstein commissioned several composers to write pieces specifically for the left hand , including Ravel , whose Concerto For The Left Hand is performed in tonight 's Prom concert . \nBut why , as 10 per cent of the population is left-handed , should it take such a loss for composers to consider doing this ? \nWhy -LRB- especially as the incidence of left-handedness is even higher among musicians -RRB- are musical instruments designed by right-handers , for right-handers ? \nLouise Doughty is left-handed and feels this has had considerable bearing on her becoming a writer . \nThere is a preconception that left-handers are more creative than most of the population , more likely to develop as artists . \nLouise enquires into the truth of this , talking to Chris McManus , Professor of Psychology and Medical Education at University College London and the author of Right Hand , Left Hand , a book about handedness and asymmetry . \nLopa Kothari presents sounds from around the world , including a Nigerian-German soul session by Nneka . \nBorn to a Nigerian father and German mother , Nneka was educated in both countries and qualified as an anthropologist . \nShe 's had mainstream chart success but does n't shy away from difficult subjects such as colonialism in Africa , corruption and religion . \nSince 2003 Nneka has been working closely with hip-hop beatmaker DJ Farhot , a producer living in Hamburg . \nPeter Curran mingles with dogs , owners and punters at Ireland 's top hare-coursing meeting Peter goes to the County Tipperary town of Clonmel to meet the dog owners and trainers , betting syndicates and bookmakers who flock to the 85th National Hare Coursing Meeting . \nWhile the ancient yet controversial sport of hare coursing was banned in the UK some time ago , it continues to thrive in the Irish Republic where a rich social , gambling and sporting culture climaxes at this event , now in its 85th year . \nSaid to be worth millions to the Irish economy , the Clonmel gathering unsurprisingly also finds itself under attack from a vociferous animal rights lobby . \nFor his three days at the races , Peter finds himself battling through a sea of fanatical dog owners and trainers , applauding an all-women betting syndicate that bursts into song with

quintessentially English place name and internet maps show that it lies just outside the town of Ormskirk in Lancashire . \nBut when the super sleuth travels to locate it on the ground , all he finds

Following on from his archive portrait of Carl Sagan , physicist Dr Brian Cox presents a tribute to Richard Feynman in this week 's Archive On 4 . \nWidely regarded as the finest physicist of his generation and the most influential since Einstein , Feynman did much to popularize science through lectures , books and television , including his dramatic revelation before the world 's media in which he demonstrated the exact cause of the Challenger Shuttle explosion in 1986 . \nDescribed as the `` Mozart of physics '' , Feynman 's amazing life and career seemingly had no end of highlights including a shared Nobel Prize for his unique contribution to the field of Quantum Electrodynamics . \nHe became the most celebrated , influential and best known American physicist of his generation -- something that would continue until his death from cancer in 1988 . \nAt the same time as his scientific reputation was building , Feynman 's unconventional attitude and behavior were helping to create his reputation for eccentricity . \nWhen bored of writing equations on chalk boards or lecturing in his lab , he would go off in search of inspiration down at the local strip club , watching the go-go girls and scribbling his calculations on napkins . \nHis eccentricity would at times infuriate his colleagues but it was simply a natural consequence of how he thought . \nBrian explores how , though few ever understood mathematics or physics like Feynman , he truly believed that science was simply too important to be left exclusively to scientists , and his energy and humor was essential in getting the public interested and inspired . \nPresenter\\/Dr Brian Cox , Producer\\/Rami Tzabar for the BBC 9.00-11 .00 am BBC RADIO 5 LIVE Danny Baker serves up his original mix of Saturday

conscience who faces a classic Hollywood dilemma : what happens when the art of the deal turns into a battle for the ultimate double-cross ? \nPlaywright Jon Robin Baitz drew upon years spent in the seedy underbelly of Hollywood to create the hilarious and unsavoury characters in his play , Mizlansky\\/Zilinsky . \nThe play also stars Paul Sand as Sam Zilinsky , with Harry Shearer , Richard Masur , Rob Morrow , Grant Shaud , Robert Walden and Kurtwood Smith . \nThe director is Ron West . \nProducing Director\\/Susan Albert Loewenberg for LA Theatre Works Sara Cox returns from maternity leave today , following the birth of her daughter earlier this year , to her regular Sunday morning show on BBC Radio 1 . \nAs one of the UK 's most popular female broadcasters with a career spanning 10

catches up with multi-platinum singer , songwriter and rapper Iyaz , who has risen to stardom over the past year . \nTo mark the historic visit of Pope Benedict XVI to Britain , the first papal visit since 1982 , Aled Jones celebrates the occasion with guests former Prime Minister Tony Blair , who converted to Catholicism soon after leaving office , and singer Dana , whose Catholic Music ministry takes her all over the world . \nThe program will feature live inserts from Cofton Park for the Beatification Mass of Cardinal John Henry Newman . \nPresenter\\/Aled Jones , Producer\\/Hilary Robinson for the BBC Excitement mounts as thousands gather to greet the Pope in London 's Hyde Park . \nSunday Half Hour 's Brian D'Arcy meets and talks with visitors and pilgrims from all corners of the country and introduces music from the event celebrating the life of faith . \nThe Papal Vigil provides Catholics in England , Scotland and Wales the chance not only to celebrate their faith but also to explain it and demonstrate how it influences their lives and the lives of those around them . \nHymns , psalms , worship songs , gospel -- a huge variety of music and musicians accompany the crowds gathered there . \nPeople representing each parish from across the UK carry banners in procession alongside members of Catholic organizations . \nCardinal Newman 's phrase `` Heart speaks unto heart '' inspires a presentation called The Heart Of The Church . \nChristian organizations use that phrase to illustrate their work as a heart that sees , a heart that understands , a heart that serves and a heart that seeks justice . \nThe Vigil Liturgy that follows consists of readings , prayers and an address by the Pope and concludes with Benediction . \nThe visit of His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI has been described by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office as an `` unprecedented opportunity to strengthen ties between the UK and the Holy See on global initiatives , and to emphasise the important role of faith in creating strong communities '' . \nPresenter\\/Brian D'Arcy , Producers\\/Clair Jaquiss and Mark O'Brien for the BBC Prize-winning Scottish novelist and poet Jackie Kay talks to Michael Berkeley about her favorite music , from Bach and Schubert to Janek , Richard Strauss and Nina Simone . \nKay 's musical favorites begin with one of Janek 's Lachian Dances -LRB- two of her stories were influenced by works by Janek -RRB- , and then move on to the Baroque era with an extract from Pergolesi 's Stabat mater and a movement from a Bach cello suite played by Pablo Casals . \nStephen Johnson explores Holst 's The Planets , with extracts and a complete performance of the work performed by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales , conducted by David Atherton . \nOriginally titled Seven Pieces For Large Orchestra , Gustav Holst 's The Planets was a remarkably original composition when it was written . \nThe first movement , Mars , the Bringer of War , was conceived in 1914 , just before the outbreak of the First World War ; almost foreseeing rather than reacting to war . \nThe work was forward-looking in many ways -- Holst scored the work for a huge orchestra , creating extraordinary sounds and colors from this vast orchestral palette , and each movement has strikingly original characteristics . \nSamuel West plays Faust in Goethe 's classic drama Samuel West , Sir Derek Jacobi , Toby Jones and Anna Maxwell Martin star in Goethe 's Faust , one of the pillars of Western literature , here presented in a version dramatised and directed by David Timson . \nIn part one of tonight 's drama , following an agreement between Mephistopheles and The Lord , the scholar Faust is tempted into a contract with the Devil . \nHis life is changed and he plunges into the enjoyment of sensuality until his emotions are stirred by a meeting with Gretchen , leading to a tragic outcome . \nPart two of Faust , written much later in Goethe 's life , presents a series of episodic scenes in which the poet places his eponymous hero in a variety of surprising circumstances reflecting the predicament of humanity . \nFunny , reflective and moving , this dramatisation shows why Goethe 's Faust had such a massive influence on Western culture . \nSamuel West stars as Faust with Toby Jones as Mephistopheles , Sir Derek Jacobi as The Lord and Anna Maxwell Martin as Gretchen . \nThe cast also includes Stephen Critchlow , Joannah Tincey , Peter Kenny , Emily Raymond , Gunnar Cauthery , Sean Barrett , Hugh Dickson , Anne-Marie Piazza , Gerard Horan , Auriol Smith , Peter Kenny , Emily Raymond and Daniel Mair . \nProducer\\/Nicholas Somes for Ukemi Productions Edward Stourton presents a special edition of the Sunday Programme live from Cofton Park , Birmingham , where

life of one of the greatest English theologians of the 19th century and prepare for the forthcoming Papal Mass. . \nThe service is led by Mike Stanley and Jo Boyce who are joined by school choirs from Coventry and Birmingham . \nProducer\\/Philip Billson for the BBC Sue MacGregor reunites people involved with the classic children 's TV program Play School , which ran from 1964 to 1988 in the final program of this series of The Reunion . \nDevised by Joy Whitby , former producer of the Listen With Mother slot on BBC Radio , Play School was a direct response to concerns about the perceived poor standard of British pre-school education . \nPlay School was ground-breaking in more ways than one as it accidentally became the first program to be shown on BBC Two after a power cut halted the opening night 's programming . \nIts enthusiastic presenters came from diverse backgrounds and became household names and , along with the iconic three shaped windows , clock and toys , formed an integral part of many early childhoods . \nSue is joined around the table by Joy along with Play School presenters Floella Benjamin , Brian Cant , who also fronted the spin-off series Play Away , and Johnny Ball , and musical director\\/pianist Jonathan Cohen . \nPresenter\\/Sue MacGregor , Producer\\/Chris Green for Whistledown Productions In Emile Zola 's love story , The Ladies Delight , business , ambition and fashion collide . \nIt is set in the hustle and excitement of the expansion of one of Paris 's first department stores . \nWhen innocent provincial girl Denise arrives in Paris , she quickly catches the eye of the notorious seducer of women , Octave Mouret . \nDespite her uncle 's disapproval , Denise accepts a job at Mouret 's department store , The Ladies Delight . \nThe cast features David Hargreaves as the Narrator ; Georgia King as Denise ; Lee Williams as Mouret ; Conrad Nelson as Bourdoncle ; Nicholas Blane as Baudu ; Will Tacey as Old Bourras , Baron and Vincard

Riches for the BBC As the final major event of the Pope 's historic visit to the UK , one of the most distinguished English Catholics of the 19th century , Cardinal Newman , was declared `` Blessed '' at a major open-air ceremony in Birmingham 's Cofton Park near to Newman 's home and oratory church . \nAccording to the Catholic Bishops ' Conference of England and Wales and the Bishops ' Conference of Scotland , Newman 's search for truth , his commitment to education and his moderation in debate all point to a man of faith in God , who cared for people and refused to pursue arguments without touching hearts . \nAs the Pope 's visit draws to its conclusion , Edward Stourton presents highlights of this Beatification , commentating on the ceremony and explaining the process of making a saint . \nIn particular , he discusses Newman 's own journey towards sainthood . \nPresenter\\/Edward Stourton , Producer\\/Philip Billson for the BBC 6.00-9 .00 am BBC RADIO 5 LIVE Rachel Burden presents

Bernard Sumner recalls his youth ; the formation of Joy Division ; and , with searing honesty , the day the group 's iconic singer , Ian Curtis , committed suicide . \nHe also talks about the band 's musical rebirth as New Order ; how they embraced technology and the emerging dance culture ; their financial troubles ; how he extricated himself from their famously bacchanalian lifestyle ; and the formation of his later bands Electronic and Bad Lieutenant . \nMore than any other form of show business , the musical needs to have something new to say -- or has to find a new way of saying something old , as Michael Ball explains as he presents Breaking The Mould , the third program in a special season of documentaries celebrating The Musical . \nAs the series of programs , each presented by a leading name from the world of musical theater , continues , Michael shows that the musical is a vulnerable medium in that it 's made of so many ingredients -- story , words , music , dance , costume and setting , all of which must come together in a perfect mix if the whole show is to succeed . \nBut one of the constants about musical theater is its ability to evolve . \nOver the years , a number of shows have broken new ground -- even smashed the mould of what was or was n't a musical -- and have been rewarded with commercial and critical success . \nExamples in this program include Jesus Christ Superstar , Show Boat , Cats , Chicago and Oklahoma ! \nContributors include : Stephen Sondheim , Joel Grey , Maury Yeston , Tim Rice , Elaine Paige , Sandy Wilson , Elaine Stritch , Cameron Mackintosh , Michael Grandage , Gillian Lynne , Ruthie Henshall , Ted Chapin , Mary Rodgers , Marge Champion and Richard Stilgoe . \nPresenter\\/Michael Ball , Producer\\/Malcolm Prince for the BBC Jools Holland 's special guest on this week 's show is American singer-songwriter Jesse Dee , who joins Jools and his band on an impromptu version of Nothing Can Change This Love . \nPresenter\\/Jools Holland , Producer\\/Sarah Gaston for the BBC Although he 's responsible for some of the best-known Spanish guitar pieces , Isaac Albniz did n't actually write any of them originally for that instrument . \nThey are all transcriptions and arrangements of some of the wealth of piano music he produced throughout his career . \nDonald Macleod this week introduces a selection of Albniz 's piano music , both in its original form and in a variety of other guises , including his masterpiece , Iberia . \nThere 's also a chance to hear Albniz 's two pieces for piano and orchestra , his only purely orchestral work , and extracts from his rarely performed operas , which came to fruition thanks to an intriguing collaboration with an English businessman with a passion for poetry . \nFrom an early age , Albniz made a good living as a highly respected pianist in his native Spain , and it was n't long before his reputation spread to France and Britain . \nAt first , composition followed in the wake of his performing career , though not for long . \nAs well as producing a large quantity of elegant salon music , Albniz began writing more Spanish-style pieces , in which he adapted traditional dances with their characteristic rhythms and tunes . \nIn this first program , Donald introduces a selection of these works from Albniz 's formative years , including his Rapsodia Espaola . \nSean Rafferty introduces a live recital from London 's Wigmore Hall by brilliant young Russian violinist Ilya Gringolts , who is joined by fellow former BBC Radio 3 New Generation Artist , pianist Ashley Wass , for sonatas by Grieg and Schumann . \nThey pair Grieg 's youthful First Sonata , written on holiday in Denmark , with Schumann 's darker and fiery Second Sonata . \nMonday 20 to Friday 24 September Neil MacGregor explores the impact of Western European travel , trade and conquest between 1450 and 1600 in this week 's A History Of The World In 100 Objects . \nHe begins with an exquisite miniature version of the sort of high-tech vessel that was to take Europeans right around the world . \nToday 's object is a small clockwork version of the type of galleon that the Spanish sent against England in the Armada , and which they also sent across the high seas . \nThis one was made for a grand dinner table -- it could move , make music , tell the time and fire tiny cannons . \nNeil discusses the significance of this new breed of sailing ships and describes the political state of which this galleon is a symbol -- the Holy Roman Empire . \nMarine archaeologist Christopher Dobbs compares the tiny galleon to the Mary Rose in Portsmouth and historian Lisa Jardine considers the European fascination with mechanics and technology throughout the 16th century . \nPresenter\\/Neil MacGregor , Producer\\/Anthony Denselow for the BBC Against the background of rising hysteria in Middlesbrough over the murders of prostitutes , Denise 's dreams of a happy second marriage , even a family at 40 years old , are challenged as circumstantial evidence seems to point the finger at her husband , Phil . \nDeveloped at the Bore Place workshop with the aim of telling a contemporary story with a small cast , Hysteria by Steve Chambers addresses the fragile dynamics of a marriage and the taboo subject of men paying for sex and how a community can so easily be whipped into a suspicious frenzy . \nChristine Kavanagah plays Denise , Michael Hodgson plays Phil , Celia Hewitt plays Kath , Colleen Prendergast plays Sheree , Sean Baker plays Jimmy , Jude Akuwudike plays John , Sally Orrock plays Nurse and Michael Shelford and Tony Bell play the policemen . \nProducer\\/David Hunter for the BBC The Last Tudor tells the story of a reality show contestant who decides that he has a greater claim to the throne than the current Royal Family . \nThis improvised drama , told in a documentary format , charts his rise and fall in a satire on celebrity , delusion and spin . \nThe story is based on the true story of Anthony Hall , a former policeman who in 1931 started to give public speeches claiming that he was the descendant of an illegitimate son of Henry VIII and therefore the last Tudor . \nThe drama supposes that Anthony Hall 's great grandson , Murray Gray , a local government employee at Bristol City Council , discovers his family history and decides to exploit the royal claim as part of his bid to win a television talent show called The Fame Factor . \nHe dresses up as Henry VIII to raise money for charitable causes , and seeks pop stardom to escape his boring job dealing with parking fines . \nInitially the case of Murray Gray is simply one story in a history documentary about Royal pretenders , but as Murray becomes more and more successful in The Fame Factor , events , and the `` documentary '' , spiral out of control . \nThe documentary is presented by real-life presenter and producer Jolyon Jenkins , who devised the drama with Abigail Youngman . \nMurray Gray is played by Jonathan Alden and his girlfriend Chantelle by Nadia Williams . \nMurray 's PR agent , Memphis Garfield , is played by real-life music promoter Conal Dodds . \nProducer\\/Jolyon Jenkins for the BBC Ivan Hewett explores the question of why certain musical keys have become associated with particular moods in a new series of Key Matters . \nA major , for example , has almost always been employed by composers to write optimistic , even ecstatic music , while in contrast E minor has become the key of choice for portraying menace and tragedy . \nIn Monday 's program , pianist and conductor Jonathan Cohen discusses the open optimism of A major . \nOn Tuesday , Ivan is joined by pianist Kenneth Hamilton to explore the treacherous and obscure world of F sharp . \nCellist and composer Philip Sheppard defines the qualities of E minor on Wednesday . \nOn Thursday , French horn player Roger Montgomery explains why F major is traditionally associated with pastoral and hunting sounds . \nAnd Ivan ends the week talking with violinist Daniel Hope about the majesty and glory of D major . \nPresenter\\/Ivan Hewett , Producer\\/Rosie Boulton for the BBC In Exit Strategy -- Choosing A Time To Die , Jenny Cuffe visits an Exit International workshop to explore the issue of assisted dying for the old . \nThe question of whether society should permit assisted suicide is n't going away . \nBut while the gray areas of the British legal system are floundered over , a radical Australian doctor has found a loophole . \nAs physically helping someone to die is illegal , he is providing information to paying participants on how to `` peacefully and painlessly '' kill themselves . \nDr Phillip Nitschke runs Exit International , an organization that distributes information on end-of-life methods . \nBanned from holding seminars in his own country , he is taking his workshops on the road , including to the UK . \nJenny gains exclusive access to an Exit International workshop . \nShe talks to the people present about their reasons for attending and investigates whether Exit is acting in the interests of humanity , or irresponsibly by offering dangerous information without safeguards . \nTalking with geriatricians , psychologists , campaigners and elderly people , Jenny explores society 's last great taboo : death . \nPresenter\\/Jenny Cuffe , Producer\\/Gemma Newby for All Out Productions Rosamund Luton 's first novel , Sister , is a suspenseful thriller about the

, presented by Barry Smith , director of the Institute of Philosophy , examines the surprising answers that contemporary neuroscience is providing to these questions and how these answers are changing our sense of ourselves . \nThe series examines how the experiences we most take for granted are due to the silent and hidden workings of several co-operative systems in the brain . \nIt explores the

with some of the world 's leading neuroscientists . \nInternationally renowned vocalist Jos James and Belgian pianist Jef Neve are in session at the BBC 's Maida Vale studios as Jamie Cullum continues

the Blue Flames , in the Caf Wha ? \nin New York 's Greenwich Village when he was spotted by Keith Richard 's girlfriend , Linda Keith . \nShe mentioned Jimi to the Animals ' bass player , Chas Chandler , who was so impressed that he signed Jimi to a management deal and brought him to London that September . \nOne of Jimi 's first gigs was to jam on the track Killing Floor with Cream at the Regent Polytechnic on London 's Regent Street . \nEric Clapton was particularly impressed and that week took Pete Townshend to see Jimi play at the Scotch of St James club in Westminster . \nJimi 's

McCartney , John Lennon , George Harrison , Brian Epstein , Roger Daltrey , Phil Collins , Spencer Davis , Jeff Beck , Brian Jones , Donovan and Lulu . \nIn early 1967 Jimi supported the Walker

wildlife , when millions of years ago the world 's land mass was concentrated around it . \nThe continents have all moved but Africa , on the same scale , has remained in the same place . \nIt is a

\nPresenter\\/Brett Westwood , Producers\\/Sheena Duncan and Julian Hector for the BBC Tuesday 21 to Thursday 23 September To mark the 50th anniversary of the launch of Sputnik , BBC Radio 4 commissioned Nick Walker to write a short story that recaptured the spirit of American Fifties B-movies . \nWhat followed , to enormous acclaim , was The First King Of Mars , the story of the first manned mission to the red planet . \nUnfortunately , the extreme isolation of space had a negative affect on the commander and his plans to become the all-powerful king of the red planet led to the first of many insurrections by his crew . \nIn The Further Adventures Of The First King Of Mars , Nick 's five stories which came hard on the heels of the initial adventure , the king arrived on the planet . \nAfter a landing that could have gone better , the king discovered that there appeared to be no subjects for him to rule over . \nThe progressive disappearance of his crew only made matters worse . \nOnly in the final episode did the intrepid cosmonaut discover that monkeys had already colonised Mars underground , creating a well-ordered and tranquil society -- a Nirvana in fact , so seductive that the crew had never been happier . \nIn this new series , The Revenge Of The First King Of Mars , which continues on Wednesday and Thursday this week , the eponymous hero takes on the monkey kingdom and its ruler , the rather aggressive Roger . \nProducer\\/Karen Rose for Sweet Talk Productions Limited Matthew Parris presents Great Lives with this week 's edition looking at the

interested , and if they have second thoughts , or if the geology of the area is found to be unsuitable , then it 's back to square one . \nAs one of the pioneers of nuclear power , Britain has a mountain of historic waste to deal with , yet -- despite the scale of the UK problem -- other countries are already decades ahead in identifying and developing storage sites hundreds of metres down into the rock . \nBBC environment correspondent Richard Black visits the Onkalo site in Finland , where the world 's first geological repository , 420m underground , is due to open for business in 10 years ' time . \nHe finds out why the Finns were so enthusiastic about volunteering , even competing , to host this nuclear waste store and considers how the same process , to identify a site here in the UK , could unfold over the crucial next 12 months . \nPresenter\\/Richard Black , Producer\\/Fiona Hill for the BBC 7.00-10 .30 pm BBC RADIO 5 LIVE Mark Pougatch presents live coverage from the

asks why most classical music has a clear ending , but so much pop music just fades out . \nAn early exception is Haydn 's Farewell Symphony of 1772 , which ends with the players leaving the stage one by one until there are only two players left . \nHaydn wrote it as a hint that the players needed a break . \nHolst 's Planets Suite -LRB- written 1914-16 -RRB- ends with a chorus of women 's voices fading into nothing -- perhaps one of the first true examples of a fade in music . \nAt the same time , recording technology was developing and fades could be created by moving away from the recording horn . \nRecord companies began imposing endings for commercial reasons or to fit onto a side of a 78rpm record , sometimes with quite brutal results . \nWith the advent of modern recording techniques it became easy to create a fade electronically , and from the Fifties onwards this became commonplace . \nBut it was in the Sixties when the fade came into its own , particularly with the iconic two-minute fade of The Beatles ' Hey Jude . \nStuart , drawing on his own experience as a DJ , talks to Stephen Johnson , presenter of BBC Radio 3 's Discovering Music ; Jacob Smith , a lecturer in Film and Television Studies ; and re-mastering engineer Roger Beardsley . \nMartyn Ware of Heaven 17 also features to talk about ending live songs that faded out in the studio versions .
