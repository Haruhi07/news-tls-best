'' \nThe officials said they hoped BP would not seek to rely on a statutory cap on how much oil companies must pay for such leaks . \nIt is not clear what prompted the letter as BP said last week the $ 75m cap was irrelevant and the firm would pay for all costs and legitimate claims . \nPresident Obama is doing his best to make sure the wave of blame that is bound to follow does not lap against the doors of the White House On Friday , President Barack Obama suggested BP and other firms were trying to duck responsibility , as he condemned a `` ridiculous spectacle '' of oil executives shifting blame in US congressional hearings . \nMr Obama has stopped all new drilling for the moment and a number of politicians want that to become permanent . \nEarly on Friday , BP began trying to thread a 6in-wide -LRB- 15cm -RRB- tube into a damaged 21in-wide pipe on the ocean floor a mile beneath the surface . \nLike a long straw , the tube is intended to slurp oil to a ship on the surface , and a stopper surrounding it would stem the flow of crude into the sea . \nAfter its first attempt failed , the company announced it would try again on Saturday night . \nBP also said the underwater chemical dispersants it began to use on Friday were already resulting in less oil rising to the top of the ocean . \nBP 's chief executive earlier told the BBC 's Today program he hoped the leak could be stopped within 10 days . \nBut the worst case scenario was `` more than that , and it 's impossible to say how much more '' , Mr Hayward added . \nA week ago , BP tried to cap the well with a 100-tonne box , but gave up after it became encrusted with ice crystals . \nSome scientists have begun to cast doubt on official estimates of the rate of oil flow , saying the widely repeated figure of 5,000 barrels of oil per day dramatically understates the real amount . \nThe spill is threatening to eclipse the 1989 Exxon Valdez leak off Alaska as America 's worst environmental disaster . \nUnderwater efforts to cap oil leak Initially , BP tried to lower a 125-tonne , 18-metre -LRB- 59 feet -RRB- high container dome over the main leak on the sea floor . \nHowever , this failed when gas leaking from the pipe mixed with water to form hydrates , ice-like crystals , that blocked up the steel canopy . \nInstead , engineers have lowered a smaller device onto the site . \nDubbed the Top hat , it will sit over the tear in the pipe and partially stop the leak . \nTo prevent the build up of hydrates , methanol is pumped into the top hat to disperse the water and gas . \nThe top hat is 1.5 m -LRB- 5 feet -RRB- high and 1.2 m in diameter . \nTwo special side lines are used to pump methanol into the top hat to displace water and gas leaking from the broken oil pipe . \nThis should prevent the build-up of hydrates . \nOnce in place , oil can be pumped up to the surface . \nBP plan to lower the original subsea containment dome over the top hat to provide a better seal over the leaking site and pump oil up to the surface . \nThis time , it will be attached to a pipe that can pump warm water into the dome to prevent the build-up of hydrates . \n"}

5,000 feet -LRB- 1.5 km -RRB- below the surface . \n2 JUNE : LOWER MARINE RISER PACKAGE After the failure of the top kill procedure , BP attempts to cut the top off the upper section of the blowout preventer -LRB- BOP -RRB- and place a cap on it , sealing the leak and taking oil to a ship on the surface . \nAfter a brief setback with some of the cutting equipment , the cap is installed and BP announces on 4 June that it is collecting oil at a rate of 1,000 barrels a day . \nThe latest stage in BP 's efforts to contain leaking oil has involved lowering a cap onto the failed blowout preventer -LRB- BOP -RRB- valve system on the seabed . \nThe cap sits on the BOP 's lower marine riser package -LRB- LMRP -RRB- section . \nFirst , the damaged riser -

'' Many vow not to buy BP petrol or products again and express visceral anger towards the oil firm . \nSome have designed their own logos , satirical takes on BP 's green and yellow livery , featuring dripping oil and skulls . \nThis is an environmental crisis that ordinary people have been able to get to grips with online in a way not possible during the US 's other notorious oil spill , the Exxon Valdez disaster of 1989 . \nNow the webcam of the broken pipe with the oil gushing into the sea has proved to be compelling viewing . \nHundreds of thousands of people have also watched the footage of robot arms doing their work . \nFlorida resident David Kearns has launched a one-man campaign of direct action against BP . \nHe has posted videos on YouTube under the alias Stanley Morton III . \nOne shows him spreading rubbish from his garden over the forecourt of a BP petrol station . \nHundreds of thousands have joined a Facebook group demanding a boycott And he attaches banners and placards on fences adjacent to the stations in an effort to get people to stop buying . \n`` I 'm outraged . \nWe live here for our beaches , for our seafood , '' he says . \n`` If you get people not to buy the gas at the pumps that hurts them . \nIt is an ` annoycott ' . '' \nHe perceives success when he sees the price of BP petrol go lower than that of its local competitors . \n`` If the price of gas has gone down , it 's hitting their bottom line . '' \nBP is cagey over the effects on sales of the oil spill so far , and it has yet to be suggested that they are devastating . \nThe issue will be complicated for many , and such situations can lead to a `` mild consumer response '' , says Prof Monroe Friedman , author of Consumer Boycotts : Effecting Change Through the Marketplace and Media . \nHe says disastrous environmental incidents caused by companies , such as the spill , `` do not necessarily lead to no-buy -LRB- action -RRB- . \nThey lead to symbolic kinds of action , things short of boycotts . \n`` Few of these gas stations are actually owned by offending companies , most of them are owned by independent operators . \n`` You are a consumer and you may be offended by the corporate actions but you may continue to buy the gas at your neighborhood station . \nOne thing is convenience , you have been doing it for years . \nYou may know the guy who owns the station .

'' BP has already had to explain that no money is being diverted from the clean-up effort . \nMass demonstrations are yet to occur While on the Gulf coast it is easy to see banners and placards attacking BP , the signs of rage may not be visible everywhere . \nThe umbrella group seizeBP.org , which wants the federal government to take all of BP 's assets as punishment for the spill , is organising nationwide protests . \nBut a demonstration at a BP-related site in Washington DC on Thursday only attracted a couple of dozen protesters . \nWhether the anger will build into mass demonstrations is unclear . \nWHY ARE N'T PEOPLE MORE ANGRY ? \nWhile it is clear that millions are outraged , their response is not always visible , particularly away from the Gulf states . \nWhere the oil is , or is headed , feelings run high `` People do n't feel at liberty to speak of it -LRB- in Louisiana -RRB- , they are dependent on BP to pay them , '' says David Kearns . \n`` In Florida , people do n't want to say too much because it 's going to hurt tourism .

{"id": "1577", "time": "2010-06-02", "text": "By Finlo Rohrer BBC News , Washington Some experts believe high winds could cause helpful dispersal The fight continues to stem the Gulf of Mexico oil spill , but could the arrival of the annual hurricane season make things worse ? \nThe prediction this year for the Atlantic is for an `` active to extremely active '' hurricane season , which officially began on 1 June . \nAccording to the US 's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , there is a 70 % chance of eight to 14 hurricanes , of which between three and seven could be major hurricanes with winds of more than 111mph -LRB- 179km\\/h -RRB- . \nI 'm of the belief that hurricanes are Mother Nature 's dispersant '' End Quote Prof Ed Overton Environmental scientist Apart from the possibility of damage and loss of life unrelated to the oil spill , there is a very obvious downside to hurricanes passing near the source of the oil spill . \nA hurricane would clearly disrupt the efforts to stop the leak , although BP has a plan to install a device in order to quickly disconnect and reconnect the link down to the spill site in high winds . \nOn shore , tasks like the laying of boom and rescue of wildlife would become more problematic . \nBut what would happen to the oil that is already out there floating in the sea ? \nHigh winds and heavy seas would mix the oil and water and help the process of biodegradation , NOAA believes . \nProf Ed Overton , an environmental studies expert at Louisiana State University -LRB- LSU -RRB- , agrees with this view . \nOperations at the site of the leaking well would be disrupted by a hurricane `` Concentrated oil in a very small area is very bad . \nBut if you spread it out nature can handle that . \nBacteria can degrade the oil . \nI 'm of the belief that hurricanes are Mother Nature 's dispersant . '' \nBut there is another downside . \nA hurricane has the potential to take oil to places it would not otherwise reach . \nIt all depends on the path of the storm . \n`` A hurricane passing to the west of the oil slick could drive oil to the coast , '' the NOAA says . \n`` A hurricane passing to the east of the slick could drive the oil away from the coast . '' \nThis is because hurricanes rotate anti-clockwise . \nTo date , the weather conditions have been relatively placid out in the Gulf of Mexico . \n`` So far the water has been very slowly moving , almost stagnant , '' says Prof Chuanmin Hu , an optical oceanographer from the University of South Florida . \nPRO : Storm could disperse oil PRO : Hurricane east of slick area could in theory send oil further out to sea CON : Hurricane could cause loss of life and damage to property CON : New oil spills could be caused CON : Storm surge could take oil far inland CON : Operations at spill site and on shore disrupted But hurricanes cause storm surges . \nSuch a surge of water has the potential not only to affect the behavior of oil far out in the Gulf , but also to cause grim consequences when it reaches the shore . \n`` It is potentially not a pretty picture , '' says Prof Nan Walker , an oceanographer at the School of the Coast and Environment at LSU . \n`` A real concern is that because Louisiana is so low-lying , even a category one storm can raise the water level eight or 10 feet . \n`` There is potential for oil to go fairly far inland , penetrating the marshes even deeper . \nIt makes the problem potentially a lot worse . '' \nThe sand berms , or barriers , that have been planned in Louisiana may not stop even a relatively small storm surge . \n`` You have to have a very high berm to stop a 10ft storm surge , '' says Prof Walker . \n`` Another issue is that the waves are enormous during a hurricane . '' \nShe recalls that Hurricane Ivan , a category four storm , created waves of 80ft -LRB- 23.4 m -RRB- out at sea . \nEnd Quote Prof Nan Walker Oceanographer If there is any oil suspended underwater , such high waves would bring it to the surface - but it is likely then to be diluted , she says . \nNOAA addresses this point , suggesting that the oil underneath the surface , anywhere away from the leak site , is only being measured in parts per million and will be further dispersed by a hurricane . \nOne thing NOAA 's experts seem clear about is that the oil leak will not have a significant effect on the formation of the hurricanes themselves . \nThe track of hurricanes is very hard to predict . \nA pressure system called the Bermuda High can alter their path , notes Prof Walker . \nIf this high pressure area is in the north , the hurricanes can be dragged up the east coast of the US . \nIf the high pressure area expands to the south or the south-west , storms can be pulled to the west , hitting Mexico and the northern Gulf coast . \nAs well as their path , their forward motion , intensity and wind speed are all very difficult to predict , NOAA notes . \nAnd previous experience of the interaction of oil spills and hurricanes has usually been based on slicks resulting from damage caused by the winds themselves . \nNo-one can be sure what is going to happen . \n`` Hurricanes are the spin ball , '' says Prof Walker . \nThe pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ? \n"}

'' \n-LRB- `` Let 's go ! '' -RRB- \n- move on a few paces . \nNot all the oil is from the Macondo well . \nStudies show that some of it comes from elsewhere , perhaps from the rigs we can see , perhaps even from the natural seepage that goes on all the time in the oil-rich Gulf of Mexico - and which has , over the eons , created an army of microbes that like nothing more than to feast , like Pac-Men , on energy-rich hydrocarbons . \nHe was confident , as everyone was , that it was just a matter of time before the oysters reappeared and everyone was happy again Organisms that just might clean up whatever muck lurks out of sight , all by themselves . \nSo the clean-up is not just about the Deepwater Horizon but about every company that has ever sought to make a fortune extracting the black stuff and bringing it ashore . \nBP , it seems , is making amends for all of us . \nBut back to the oysters and another family business struggling with the fallout . \nOn the edge of New Orleans ' legendary French quarter , the P & J Oyster Company has been in business for more than 130 years . \nLike Nick Collins , Al Sunseri wonders if he has what it takes to recover . \nThe ice which gushes noisily into his giant coolers every eight minutes has very little to cool and the high , whitewashed-stone shucking tables are deserted . \nThe Exxon Valdez ran aground off Alaska spilling 11m gallons of oil He has laid off all but two temporary workers who keep a trickle of customers happy with oysters from nearby Texas . \nAl also had to deal with Katrina , downsizing and waiting for the oyster beds to replenish themselves . \nHe was confident , as everyone was , that it was just a matter of time before the oysters reappeared and everyone was happy again . \nBut now he wonders about his son , who has experienced depression and has not been working for a couple of months . \nHe says he remembers his own anxiety as a young man , taking over a business with such a long tradition to uphold . \nHe thinks about Alaska and the herrings that disappeared from Prince William Sound three years after the Exxon Valdez spill , never to return . \nMore than seven months after the blowout on the Deepwater Horizon , the full ramifications of this disaster are still hard to gauge . \nThe uncertainty gnaws at everyone who depends on the sea . \nIs it possible , they wonder , that the worst days may still lie ahead ? \nHow to listen to : From Our Own Correspondent BBC Radio 4 : Saturdays , 1130 . \n"}
{"id": "2131", "time": "2010-09-19", "text": "On 20 April , the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded in the Gulf of Mexico , killing 11 workers and causing an oil spill that soon became the worst environmental disaster in US history . \nHere is a chronology of events in the months since , as BP has struggled to stem the leak and oil has washed ashore along the Gulf Coast , from the fragile Louisiana wetlands to the white sand beaches of Florida . \nThe ruptured well is finally sealed and `` effectively dead '' , says the top US federal official overseeing the disaster , Coast Guard Adm Thad Allen . \nBP pumps cement to seal the damaged well after it was intercepted by a relief well . \nIn its own internal report into the Gulf of Mexico oil spill - the first to be published since the disaster - BP spreads the blame for the 11 April explosion and resulting leak . \nIn a 193-page report BP accepts responsibility in part for the disaster , but also blames other companies working on the well . \nThad Allen , the US coastguard official overseeing the clean-up operation , says the BP oil well at the center of the leak poses `` no further risk '' to the environment , despite the final stages of an operation to pump concrete into a relief well remaining unfinished . \nThe blowout preventer that failed to stop the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig is removed from the stricken Gulf of Mexico oil well by BP . \nThe 300-ton device will be examined as part of the inquiry into the leak of 206m gallons of oil into the Gulf . \nMeanwhile , the cost of the oil spill has risen to $ 8bn -LRB- # 5.2 bn -RRB- , BP says - a rise of some $ 2bn in the past month alone . \nA study published in a leading scientific journal confirms the presence of a toxic chemical residue one kilometre below the surface of the Gulf of Mexico , but says it amounts to just 0.1 % of the total amount spilled . \nThe US announces that future applications for deepwater offshore drilling will require an environmental assessment , ending a practice that allowed BP 's Deepwater Horizon rig to drill with little scrutiny . \nThe White House said decision-making must be `` fully informed '' by knowledge of any potential environmental consequences . \nBP announces that the total cost to it of the oil spill so far has reached $ 6.1 bn -LRB- # 3.8 bn -RRB- . \nThe total includes the cost of the spill response , containment , relief well drilling , and cementing up of the damaged well . \nIt also includes grants to the Gulf states hit by the spill and $ 319m paid out in compensation to some of those affected by the spill . \nThe US government says three-quarters of the oil spilled in the Gulf has been cleaned up or broken down by natural forces . \nMeanwhile , BP reports `` encouraging '' progress with the `` static kill '' operation to plug the well with mud and seal it with cement . \nThe US government says the oil spill is officially the biggest leak ever , with 4.9 million barrels of oil leaked before the well was capped last month . \nScientists said only a fifth of the leaking oil - around 800,000 barrels - was captured during the clean-up operation . \nThe US Environmental Protection Agency says in a study the dispersant used after the spill is no more toxic than oil alone . \nThere had been concerns raised by congressional investigators that dispersant may have been more widely used than the government ordered . \nUS scientists say the oil from the well has cleared from the sea surface faster than expected , 100 days after the disaster began . \nMr Hayward will leave his post by October BP confirms that chief executive Tony Hayward will leave his post by mutual agreement in October , but he is likely to retain a position in the company . \nBP plans to nominate him as a non-executive director of its Russian joint venture , TNK-BP . \nMr Hayward 's American colleague , Bob Dudley , who has taken charge of the clean-up operation , will replace him . \nMeanwhile , the oil giant 's second quarter earnings are published , showing losses of $ 17bn for the three months between April and June - a UK record . \nThe company says it has set aside $ 32.2 bn -LRB- # 20.8 bn -RRB- to cover the costs linked to the Gulf of Mexico spill . \nThe BBC reveals that 53-year old BP chief executive Tony Hayward will receive a year 's salary plus benefits , together worth more than # 1m , when he steps down . \nHe will also be entitled to draw an annual pension of # 600,000 once he reaches the age of 55 . \nShips involved in BP 's effort to secure the blown-out oil well prepare to resume work after a tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico weakened . \nCoast Guard chief Adm Thad Allen says the storm put back efforts to drill a relief well by seven to 10 days . \nThe rig drilling a relief well was ordered to leave the spill site ahead of Tropical Storm Bonnie Dozens of vessels , including the rig drilling a relief well to permanently block the damaged well , are ordered to leave the site as Tropical Storm Bonnie approaches . \nBP warns that the final operation to plug the well could be delayed by up to two weeks by the storm . \nThe capped well is to remain unmonitored for several days . \nMeanwhile , BP says it has been given permission to prepare for a `` static kill '' - pumping mud into the top of the well through the new cap - a step viewed as an intermediate measure . \nThe firm would need final approval from the US to carry it out . \nAdm Allen tells BP he is concerned about a `` detected seep '' on the sea floor near the well and other `` undetermined anomalies '' . \nHe said that if methane was found to be seeping from the sea floor , oil might also be leaking . \nWith the new cap in place , BP says it has temporarily shut off the oil flow in order to test the integrity of the well . \nPresident Barack Obama hails `` a positive sign '' . \nAdm Thad Allen says a relief well , which officials and BP have said is the only way permanently to plug the well , has come within 5ft -LRB- 1.5 m -RRB- of the leaking well bore . \nBP begins a bid to place a tighter-fitting cap atop the leaking wellhead . \nThe company warns that oil will flow freely while the caps are being exchanged , but says it has brought in 400 oil-skimming ships to deal with the increased flow . \nThe BBC 's Madeleine Morris says it may take days to complete the operation Oil from the spill reaches Texas , meaning it has affected all five US Gulf Coast states . \nBut officials said it was unclear if the oil had drifted hundreds of kilometres from the leak site to the Texas shore , or had fallen from ships taking part in the clean-up operation . \nBP says the oil spill response has cost the company $ 3.12 bn -LRB- # 2bn -RRB- , including the cost of containing the spill and cleaning up the oil , and the cost of drilling relief wells . \nThe figure also includes $ 147m paid out in compensation to some of those affected by the spill . \nMany fishermen put out of work by the oil spill have taken jobs in the clean-up effort A federal judge blocks the Obama administration 's six-month moratorium on deepwater oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico , saying the ban can not be justified . \nThe administration quickly issues another moratorium with revised terms . \nMeanwhile , BP hands day-to-day control of the response to Bob Dudley , replacing Chief Executive Tony Hayward , who had been widely criticised for his insensitive remarks on the spill . \nBP chief executive Tony Hayward receives a tongue-lashing at a hearing in the US Congress . \nHenry Waxman , chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce , says BP 's `` complacency '' before the 20 April rig explosion was `` astonishing '' . \nBP announces it will place $ 20bn in a fund to compensate victims of the oil spill and says it will not pay a shareholder dividend this year . \nPresident Obama addresses the nation from the Oval Office , vowing , `` We will make BP pay for the damage their company has caused . '' \nResponding to complaints in the British media of an anti-British tone to his remarks , President Barack Obama tells UK Prime Minister David Cameron that his criticism of BP has nothing to do with national identity . \nThe US Geological Survey estimates the oil flow at as many as 40,000 barrels per day before a cap was put on the well on 3 June . \nBP announces it is collecting 15,800 barrels per day from the well . \nSkimmers , including the giant `` A Whale '' , are cleaning oil from the surface Adm Thad Allen , the commander of the US response , says clean-up of the oil-stricken Gulf could take years . \nMeanwhile , President Obama says he has been consulting with experts so he can learn `` whose ass to kick '' in the matter . \nThe US government says underwater oil plumes have traveled as far as 40 miles from the site of the leaking well . \nBP places a cap , called the `` lower marine riser package '' , atop the leaking wellhead . \nThe cap allows the company to pipe much of the oil and gas leaking from the well to ships on the surface . \nPresident Obama takes a third trip to the region . \nThe US announces a criminal inquiry into the BP oil spill . \nCarol Browner , President Barack Obama 's adviser on energy policy , says the spill is the worst environmental disaster in US history , worse even than the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska . \nObama visits the Gulf Coast again and declares `` the buck stops with me '' . \nBP prepares to plug the leaking well with heavy drilling mud , a procedure called a `` top kill '' . \nThe attempt is declared a failure three days later . \nOceanographers say oil from the leak has entered an ocean current - the `` loop current '' - that could carry it towards Florida and potentially up the US east coast . \nPelicans are among the wildlife harmed by the oil Researchers who have analyzed underwater video from the leak site estimate as many as 70,000 barrels of oil are leaking into the Gulf per day , with a margin of error of plus or minus 20 % , significantly higher than earlier estimates . \nBP tries to thread a tube into the broken wellhead in an effort to collect some of the leaking oil in surface ships . \nMeanwhile , President Obama condemns the `` ridiculous spectacle '' of the companies trading blame while oil spews from the well . \nAt a series of congressional hearings , BP , Transocean and Halliburton , the three companies involved in the Deepwater Horizon drilling operations , all blame each other for the disaster . \nBP officials weigh shoving debris , including golf balls and rubber tyres , into the leaking wellhead , a maneuver known as the `` junk shot '' . \nThey also ready a `` top hat '' - a metal dome - to be placed over the leak . \nMeanwhile , BP reveals the oil spill has cost the company $ 350m -LRB- # 233m -RRB- so far . \nBP 's effort to place a giant metal box atop the leaking well to contain the spill fails when ice crystals accumulate inside the box and engineers are forced to remove it . \nMeanwhile , officials revise the estimate of the leak 's rate upward to 5,000 barrels per day . \nPresident Obama makes his first trip to the Gulf Coast and says BP is responsible for the leak and for paying for its clean-up . \n`` We 're dealing with a massive and potentially unprecedented environmental disaster , '' he says . \n`` The oil that is still leaking from the well could seriously damage the economy and the environment of our Gulf states . \nAnd it could extend for a long time . \nIt could jeopardise the livelihoods of thousands of Americans who call this place home . '' \nPresident Obama said he would ` spare no effort ' in responding to the crisis Oil from the leaking well begins washing ashore in Louisiana . \nSoon fragile coastal wetlands are inundated with thick , brown mud . \nPresident Barack Obama 's administration bans oil drilling in new areas off the US coast pending investigations into the cause of the BP spill . \nBefore the spill , Mr Obama had said he would allow new offshore drilling . \nThe US Coast Guard sets fire to patches of spilled oil in an effort to prevent the slick from reaching the vulnerable Louisiana coastal wetlands . \nPresident Barack Obama pledges `` every single available resource '' , including the military , to help in the response effort . \nThe US Coast Guard warns the oil leak could become the worst oil spill in US history . \nIn a reverse , officials reveal the well is leaking an estimated 1,000 barrels of oil per day and warn of environmental disaster . \nMeanwhile , BP sends undersea robots to the wellhead in an unsuccessful effort to activate the blowout preventer , a piece of heavy kit mounted on top of the well to stem the flow of oil . \nThe Coast Guard says it had no indication that oil was leaking from the well 5,000 ft below the surface of the Gulf . \nThe Deepwater Horizon sinks to the bottom of the Gulf after burning for 36 hours , raising concerns of a catastrophic oil spill . \nA Coast Guard official says the Macondo well , which the rig had been drilling , could be releasing up to 8,000 barrels of oil per day . \nAn explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig in the Gulf of Mexico , 52 miles -LRB- 84km -RRB- south-east of Venice , Louisiana , kills 11 workers . \nOperator Transocean , under contract for BP , says it had no warning of trouble ahead of the blast . \nThe rig was drilling in about 5,000 ft -LRB- 1,525 m -RRB- of water , pushing the boundaries of deepwater drilling technology . \nThe pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ? \n"}

'' \nVirtually all of the methane remained suspended and dissolved in sea water at depths of around one kilometre . \nBacteria in the water that have evolved to process naturally-seeping methane apparently increased in number , taking oxygen from the water as they did so , and mopping up the Deepwater Horizon 's cargo . \nThe team 's calculations indicate that less than one hundred thousandth of the gas released made it into the atmosphere . \nMethane is the second most important gaseous component of the man-made portion of the greenhouse effect . \nThe Gulf waters were sampled for methane And vast quantities of it - no-one knows how much , though some estimates put it as 3,000 times the current amount in the atmosphere - lie trapped in the sea bed around the Arctic . \nThere are other deposits around the world as well . \nSome see this methane hydrate as a potential future energy source . \nOthers fear that if it escapes as the seas warm , it will act to amplify global warming . \nIn principle , the Deepwater Horizon research could help inform scientists about how serious methane releases could be - how much would be processed in sea water , and how much would make it into the atmosphere . \nWe do n't know the distribution of the methane hydrates - we do n't know how pervasive they are in the region '' End Quote Professor Graham Westbrook Birmingham University `` In the Arctic , there definitely would be some sort of microbial response ; and in most places on the sea floor that have the capacity for massive release , there will be some seepage that will help to populate the water with microbes that could respond , '' Dr Kessler told BBC News . \nHowever , he cautioned , there are big differences between the Gulf of Mexico leak and potential methane sources in the Arctic . \nEd Dlugokencky , who runs Noaa 's global registry of methane concentrations but was not involved in the Gulf research , agreed . \n`` The implications of this work for release of methane from hydrates likely only applies to deep waters , not areas where hydrates exist on shallow continental shelves such as the East Siberian Arctic shelf , '' he said . \n`` There , water is only about 40m deep , and bubbling is an important mechanism for transport of methane from the sediments to the atmosphere . '' \nThe shallower the water , the less time methane would spend in it , making absorption less likely . \nTemperature , currents and the types of bacteria present could be other factors important in determining how much makes it into the atmosphere . \nHowever , Dr Dlugokencky noted that evidence of vast , rapid releases of methane from the sea floor has not been seen in ice-core records , which now trace Earth history back about 800,000 years . \nMethane can escape from hydrates on or under the sea bed , and bubble to the surface ; higher temperatures may exacerbate the problem Research ships make regular cruises to the Arctic and have regularly found evidence of methane bubbling into the atmopshere . \nBut , said Professor Graham Westbrook from the UK 's University of Birmingham , there is still a lot of basic science to be done . \n`` We do n't know the distribution of the methane hydrates - we do n't know how pervasive they are in the region , '' he said . \n`` And in places like the shelf areas north of Siberia , where releases have been found , it 's not clear how much of this is coming from the sea bed and how much is brought into the sea by rivers . \n`` Also , we do n't know how much of the releases we see are down to anthropogenic warming in the last couple of centuries , and how much relates to the natural warming we 've seen since the end of the last Ice Age .

'' \nDon Boesch , a member of the investigating commission , told the BBC 's World Today program they had identified `` a whole sequence of poor decisions with unfortunate consequences when put together '' . \nHe said that not all the faults lay with BP , although the company did have overall responsibility . \nDavid Shukman with the `` top hats '' used by BP to help seal oil leaks `` For example the lack of a proper test that was done and the cement that was used to seal the bottom of the well , that was pretty clearly the direct responsibility of Halliburton , '' he said . \n`` When the well started to blow there were decisions made by Transocean about how the material coming up the well was handled , and those were unfortunate , fateful , decisions which actually led to the explosion . '' \nMr Boesch said government regulators are also criticised in the report . \nMost of the mistakes and oversights at Macondo can be traced back to a single overarching failure - a failure of management '' End Quote National Oil Spill Commission report `` What we found was very limited oversight of these various activities and decisions , that the agency responsible in the Department of the Interior was understaffed , -LRB- and -RRB- did n't have the inspectors and technical analysts who were up to the task fully . '' \nThe findings came in the final report of the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling , which President Barack Obama convened in May to investigate the root causes of the spill and recommend changes to industry and government policy . \nThough it lacked subpoena power , the panel reviewed thousands of pages of documents , interviewed hundreds of witnesses , and in the autumn conducted a series of public hearings . \nIn a statement released on Wednesday , Bob Graham , former Florida governor and a co-chairman of the commission , said the findings showed the blow-out was avoidable . \n`` This disaster likely would not have happened had the companies involved been guided by an unrelenting commitment to safety first , '' he said . \nThe oil spill was an avoidable disaster caused by a series of failures and blunders made by BP and its partners , including Transocean and Halliburton , and government departments assigned to regulate them , the panel concludes . \nIt also warns such a disaster would likely recur because of industry complacency . \nBP internal report -LRB- September 2010 -RRB- BP admits its managers on the oil rig could have prevented the catastrophe had they picked up warning signs of a breach of the cement seal at the bottom of the well , as well as unusual pressure test readings , shortly before the explosion . \nBut it places much of the blame on Transocean and Halliburton . \nChemical Safety Board investigation into regulatory approaches to offshore industry Joint inquiry by the US Coast Guard and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management National Academy of Engineering analysis In a months-long investigation , the panel found that mistakes and `` failures to appreciate risk '' compromised safeguards `` until the blow-out was inevitable and , at the very end , uncontrollable '' . \nBP 's `` fundamental mistake '' , the panel wrote , was failing to exercise proper caution over the job of sealing the well with cement . \n`` Based on evidence currently available , there is nothing to suggest that BP 's engineering team conducted a formal , disciplined analysis of the combined impact of these risk factors on the prospects for a successful cement job , '' the report reads . \nThe conclusions run counter to industry efforts to portray the Deepwater Horizon disaster as a rare occurrence , as oil companies prod the US government to open greater areas of the US coast to oil exploration . \n`` The blowout was not the product of a series of aberrational decisions made by rogue industry or government officials that could not have been anticipated or expected to occur again , '' the report read . \n`` Rather , the root causes are systemic and , absent significant reform in both industry practices and government policies , might well recur .

'' \nThe agency also said the use of dispersants had nearly halted since the well was capped on 15 July . \nOn Sunday , the Washington Post reported that the US Coast Guard had granted BP 74 requests to use dispersants over 54 days on the Gulf surface and underwater , in spite of an administration order to limit their use . \nThe paper found that the Coast Guard had granted every request to use the chemicals , although in some cases it had reduced the amount that could be deployed . \nIn a letter released on Saturday , Democratic Congressman Edward Markey , chairman of the House energy and environment sub-committee , wrote that instead of complying with the EPA 's instructions , `` BP often carpet-bombed the ocean with these chemicals and the Coast Guard allowed them to do it '' . \nLast week , BP reported a record $ 17bn -LRB- # 11bn -RRB- loss , having set aside $ 32bn to cover the costs of the spill - the worst in US history . \nThe spill may soon come to a permanent end , with BP preparing to inject mud and possibly cement into its blown-out well on Tuesday to seal it . \nUnder the `` static kill '' procedure , the company will pump mud and cement into the well on Tuesday and Wednesday , if tests scheduled for Monday night yield positive results . \nThe static kill , also known as `` bullheading '' , takes place in three stages . \nFirst , a test determines if oil can be pushed back down the well into the reservoir If that goes well , the static kill is begun by pumping in mud at low pressure . \nThat may take all of Tuesday and possibly run into Wednesday Then , engineers will have to decide whether to pump in cement at the top of the well or wait and pump in cement from the relief well into the bottom of the damaged well . \nThe relief well will reach the damaged well some time between 11 and 15 August . \nThe permanent `` bottom kill '' will take anywhere between a number of days and a few weeks . \nThe final casing has been cemented in place , which is the prelude to the last bit of drilling . \nAn earlier effort , in May , to pump mud into the well using much of the same equipment failed because the pressure of the spewing oil and gas was too great . \nThe pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ? \n"}

'' \nBP and Adm Allen also discussed on Monday the possibility of using the new cap to carry out a `` static kill '' procedure - a similar operation to the `` top kill '' procedure carried out unsuccessfully two months ago . \nBP said `` static kill '' would involve sending heavy drilling mud down through the blowout preventer valve system and then injecting cement into the well to seal it . \nBubbles are coming from the cap on the well but the pressure test continues `` We 're still very much in the design and planning phase , '' said senior BP vice president for exploration and production Kent Wells . \n`` We 've got some real experienced teams working on this over the next couple of days .

{"id": "761", "time": "2010-04-30", "text": "By Richard Black Environment correspondent , BBC News The already threatened manatee could be a casualty of the oil leak How bad will the Gulf of Mexico oil spill turn out to be - for wildlife and for people whose jobs depend on wildlife , such as fishermen ? \nAt the moment , the only completely accurate answer would appear to be : we do not know . \nFor David Kennedy from the US National Ocean Service , it is `` a very very significant event , and of great concern '' . \nBut Clifford Jones , an oil and gas engineering specialist from the UK 's Aberdeen University , suggests it should not be considered in the same category as the Exxon Valdez spill of 1989 , with which it is regularly being compared . \nIt is a threat to the ecosystem , he allows , but says the Exxon Valdez leaked significantly more oil than is likely to flow from the stricken Deepwater Horizons drillsite before pressure in the well drops and stops forcing the oil out . \nWe have to hope for the best , but prepare for the worst , including a true catastrophe for birds '' End Quote Melanie Driscoll National Audubon Society There is no doubt that the oil is coming out much more slowly than is normal from a tanker spill . \nIn principle , this allows the authorities greater time to deal with it - although clearly in this case their efforts have met with mixed success . \nOil breaks down naturally in seawater , and in the warm Gulf of Mexico water , this would proceed much faster than in Alaska 's Prince William Sound , where the Exxon Valdez ran aground . \nIn oil spills , as in medicine , prevention is always better than cure . \nAnd the first priority for authorities in Louisiana and elsewhere along the Gulf coast is to stop oil washing up on shore . \nBooms are being deployed , dispersants sprayed , and some patches of oil are being burned . \nThe Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority is increasing the flow of water through two inland water channels in an attempt to wash oil-tainted seawater out of ecologically important wetlands . \n`` Home not only to a thriving fishing industry but also a substantial nature reserve , the potential for damage is enormous , '' says Simon Coxall from the UK 's National Oceanography Centre in Southampton . \nThe coastline sees land interlacing delicately with the sea -LRB- oil slick bottom right -RRB- `` Booming the area off with floating dams to protect these areas is the best option ; but the size of the spill will exhaust the world 's supply of oil booms very quickly . '' \nWhat makes this region ecologically special is the unusual patterns of land and sea conjured into existence by the lazy and variegated exit of the mighty Mississippi into the Gulf . \nHere lie about 25 % of US wetlands - areas rich with life , where human occupancy is low , and birds and other animals can thrive . \n`` For birds , the timing could not be worse ; they are breeding , nesting and especially vulnerable in many of the places where the oil could come ashore , '' warns Melanie Driscoll , a Louisiana-based bird conservation director with the National Audubon Society , the leading US bird conservation group . \n`` We have to hope for the best , but prepare for the worst , including a true catastrophe for birds . '' \nThe society 's list of species potentially affected includes resident seabirds , waders and waterfowl , including heron , brown pelicans and oystercatchers , and migratory birds such as plovers , swallows and buntings that use the Gulf wetlands as a stopover . \nThe society points out that for some species , this is the now only home they have , with human development further inland having fenced them into these extremities . \nApproximate oil locations 22 April - 15 May The oil slick changes shape and direction rapidly , so predicting where it will make landfall and with what frequency is a hazardous business . \nClearly , the longer it takes BP to stem the flow , the greater the chance that its impacts will be felt further around the shores of the Gulf of Mexico , and indeed in its open water . \nIf the oil flows east , it will encounter the seagrass beds that form a key habitat for manatees , among other species . \n`` If you 've got seagrass beds badly contaminated , clearly the manatees could be seriously affected , '' says Carl-Gustaf Lundin , head of the Marine Programme at the International Union for the Conservation of Nature -LRB- IUCN -RRB- . \nHere again is a species that is already under severe stress . \nFewer than 2,500 adults remain , and the IUCN Red List says the Florida subspecies is expected to decline by at least 20 % over the next 40 years , with various factors implicated , including climate change and impacts from boats . \nSpawning of bluefin tuna takes place in the oil-affected waters The Gulf waters are already affected annually by fertilisers washing down from southern US farmlands , resulting in a `` dead zone '' where algae have consumed most of the dissolved oxygen and nothing else can grow . \nThe Atlantic bluefin tuna is another possible victim . \nOver the next six weeks , the western population of this heavily depleted species will spawn in the Gulf of Mexico - principally in the northern portion where the slick is growing . \n`` The oil would have an impact - it might be toxic to eggs or to the young fry , '' says Dr Lundin . \n`` Also , the young hide in sargassum -LRB- floating marine plants -RRB- - they 're very vulnerable at this stage - and this could also be affected by oil . '' \nEach of these possible impacts on wildlife translates into human consequences . \nFor tuna and shrimp , you can read jobs in the fishing industry and food supplies for US consumers . \nFor birds and manatees , you can read tourist income . \nNo two oil spills are alike ; and given the vagaries of winds and sea currents , predicting the likely impact of this one is very difficult . \nBut you can see why local authorities and conservation groups are beginning to be seriously concerned . \nThe pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ? \n"}

{"id": "810", "time": "2010-08-03", "text": "By Richard Black Environment correspondent , BBC News The oil has covered waters key to creatures such as crabs Following release of the US government 's latest estimate , the Deepwater Horizon disaster is confirmed as the biggest ever accidental release of oil into the oceans . \nIt exceeds the 1979 Ixtoc I leak - also in the Gulf of Mexico . \nIt 's comfortably bigger than tanker releases such as the Torrey Canyon and Amoco Cadiz , and 20 times the size of the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill with which it is often compared . \nNow that BP finally appears to have the flow under control , an important question - perhaps the most important of all - is being asked : it may have been the biggest , but was it the worst ? \nIt is a simple-sounding question , but devilishly hard to answer . \nWhat impacts are we talking about - on the coast , on the ocean surface , or the sea floor ? \nWhich species are we including - fish , shrimp , insects , plants , birds , whales , turtles - or some combination of them all ? \nAre we looking long-term or short-term , local or regional - and are we to include or exclude impacts from the use of chemical dispersants and fires and the other containment measures ? \nOne thing that is clear is that different parts of the Gulf coast have seen very different levels of impact . \nGrasses in the wetland regions show damage - but they may recover Two weeks ago , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration -LRB- Noaa -RRB- announced that so little oil was being seen in a zone covering more than 26,000 square miles -LRB- 67,000 sq km -RRB- - a quarter of US territorial waters in the Gulf - that fishing could safely re-start . \nYet in other areas , particularly along the coast , people are struggling daily to nurse oil-soaked birds back to health . \nMany commentators were saying during the early days of the episode that the ecological impacts would depend largely on the vagaries of winds and tides ; and so it has proven . \nNoaa has said that about three-quarters of the 4.9 million barrels leaked into the Gulf waters has already vanished from the area - through evaporation , capture , burning , or dispersion . \nBut that still leaves more than a million barrels at sea . \nAs a formerly significant US figure said in the context of a different Gulf : there are known unknowns , and unknown unknowns . \nOnce it makes to it to shore it is causing an impact on our most sensitve ecosystem that is extremely difficult to clean up '' End Quote Paul Anastas EPA Andy Nyman , an associate professor of Wetland Wildlife Ecology at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge , has spent years conducting laboratory and field research into the possible impacts of oil spills on the coastal wetlands that are so vital as nurseries for fish and shrimp , nesting grounds for birds and as coastal defences . \n`` It 's going to be difficult to pick up the impacts of the oil spill and separate those from natural seasonal variability , '' he says . \n`` Impacts we 'll be looking for in the short term include the loss of wetland grasses and reductions in fish and other things that live in the water . \n`` In the longer term we could see reduced productivity in these populations , but we may not be able to detect it because the annual variations are quite large . '' \nHe relates taking two trips along the coastal fringe in recent weeks . \nIn one zone , they could see virtually no impact on the grasses . \nIn the other , a stretch of coast about 10km -LRB- six miles -RRB- long showed significant damage , with swathes of grass brown and shedding leaves . \nYet on many plants , new green stems were sprouting - just as happened on the grasses in Professor Nyman 's experimental plot after he had coated them in oil to see how they would perform . \nHow the grasslands will fare in the long term is definitely a known unknown . \nTime 's lens will also reveal the impact on fish and shrimp , so vital to the local economy . \nBut again , the stock varies naturally from season to season ; so picking out a specific impact of the oil leak could prove difficult . \nOut in the Gulf itself , the impact on bluefin tuna is potentially significant . \nThe spawning grounds have been covered in oil at times , and there are fears that an entire year 's brood may be missing . \nBut that will not become clear for several years . \nEstimating the marine impacts will also be complicated by the fact that closing the fisheries has given stocks a respite from nets and hooks . \nSo how much do we know ? \nSeveral hundred thousand seabirds died from the Exxon Valdez spill - possibly as many as 600,000 , according to some estimates . \nBy contrast , the number of birds found dead along the Gulf of Mexico coast is a little over 3,000 . \nJust over 500 sea turtles and 64 dolphins have also been found dead . \nBut that is partly a function of the leak 's geography ; turtles would not have been affected by the Exxon Valdez simply because they do not frequent the coasts of Alaska . \nConversely , the Exxon Valdez claimed the lives of several thousand sea otters - which do not live along the Gulf coast . \nTurtles are among the animals affected by the leak An important unknown - about which very little is known - is the importance of flows of oil deep underwater that were detected a couple of months ago and that almost certainly have dispersants mixed in . \nThe use of these chemicals is controversial . \nThey keep the oil away from shore - but the cost is paid in clogged wads of crude that sink to the sea floor . \nPaul Anastas , assistant administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency 's -LRB- EPA -RRB- Office of Research and Development , acknowleged that dispersants were far from perfect , but said their use here had been , on balance , positive . \n`` The purpose of the dispersants is to put the oil in a form that can be broken down and degraded by natural microbes , '' he said . \n`` Once it makes to it to shore it is causing an impact on our most sensitve ecosystem that is extremely difficult to clean up and has an extreme negative impact on the ecosystem of the Gulf .

'' \nBP 's Doug Suttles explains hitch The smaller containment dome would theoretically be less likely to get blocked by hydrates because it would contain less water . \nIt could be ready to deploy on Tuesday or Wednesday . \nTapping into the riser would be difficult , experts say . \nAnother solution might be to plug up the blow-out preventer at the well-head , which failed to cut the flow after the explosion on the rig last month , with a `` junk shot '' of rubber and another material , Mr Suttles said . \nMeanwhile , a relief well is being drilled - considered a more permanent solution to the leak - but that is weeks from completion . \n"}

'' \n`` I do not carry any candles for BP . \nNor am I terribly fussed if a US president thinks there are votes to be garnered by stirring up anti-British feeling . \nThe Brits will get over it . \nIt is fair to say that BP has badly fumbled its response to the crisis . \nIf prior negligence is proved , the company must surely stump up billions of dollars in recompense for the havoc wrought by the spill . \nAll that said , surely the leader of the world 's most powerful nation can think of better things to do than to think up new ways to vilify BP 's chief executive Tony Hayward ? '' \n`` By continually , and repeatedly referring to ` British Petroleum ' the politicos over the water are constantly pushing a subliminal line that it 's not America 's fault . \nThe key here is to refer to another nationality in order to ignore the reality that many of the staff involved before it went wrong are American . \nTo ignore the fact that the company is a merger of one of America 's own oil big boys .

{"id": "1367", "time": "2010-06-16", "text": "Just how sharply have the estimates changed ? \nUS scientists issued a figure of 35,000-60 ,000 barrels -LRB- 1.5-2 .5 million gallons -RRB- per day on 15 June . \nThe figure was accepted by US Energy Secretary Steven Chu as `` a significant step forward in our effort to put a number on the oil '' . \nBy contrast , an estimate announced by US officials on 26 April put the flow at just 1,000 barrels per day . \nThat figure was later revised to 5,000 barrels . \nThen it was 12,000-19 ,000 , then 20,000-40 ,000 . \nWhy does the flow rate keep rising ? \nNormally the flow from a well is measured on a rig but the flow meters on the Deepwater Horizon were destroyed along with the rig in the explosion . \nThe 15 June estimate is based partially on data gathered from pressure meters placed on the sea-bed on BP 's containment cap , which is collecting some of the oil . \nAnother method scientists have used to measure the flow is to combine data from satellite photos of the slick on the sea surface with estimates of the oil 's thickness . \nBut the reliability of this approach depends partly on how much oil has reached the surface , says Geoffrey Maitland , professor of energy engineering at Imperial College , London . \nExperts in fluid mechanics have been tracking particles coming out of the broken riser pipe and measuring their velocity . \nThey have been refining their models of the flow based on the levels of oil , gas and solid particles coming from the well . \nOther estimates are based on video from the downhole of the well . \nA team from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in the US is also using acoustic techniques to measure flow rates . \nHow much oil is being collected by BP ? \nBP says the containment cap -LRB- the lower marine riser package , or LMRP -RRB- it placed on the well 's damaged blowout preventer -LRB- BOP -RRB- on 3 June is collecting about 15,000 barrels a day , piping it up to a ship on the surface . \nEven if the amount of oil escaping is the low-end figure of 35,000 barrels , that leaves 20,000 leaking into the sea daily . \nThe British company was due , as of mid-June , to start up a second containment system -LRB- SCS -RRB- that would increase collection to 20,000-28 ,000 barrels a day . \nThe SCS is meant to take oil and gas from the BOP 's choke line through a separate riser pipe to another vessel on the surface , where the fuels will be burnt off . \nThe company plans to be able to handle 80,000 barrels of escaped oil per day by mid-July . \nBP `` under-estimated the flow rate '' and `` over-estimated their ability to fight against that flow rate '' , says Ian MacDonald , professor of oceanography at Florida State University . \nHe told the BBC : `` This was perhaps a fatal miscalculation ... with the result that this crisis has continued much longer , with much greater release of oil than would have been necessary had they -LRB- BP -RRB- made much more accurate flow rates at the very start . '' \nHow accurate are the latest measurements ? \nIt is very difficult to say because the models are constantly being revised and combined with observation . \nThe main plume of oil is being treated with dispersants and surfactants , wetting agents which lower the surface tension of the oil so it can mix with the water . \nThese make an emulsion which brings the oil more quickly to the surface , where it can be scooped up by collection vessels . \nThere are concerns that some of the oil is forming separate , smaller plumes below the surface , Professor Maitland says . \nThis may make it more difficult to estimate the total size of the spill . \nNot all the oil has surfaced yet , but it will eventually , because oil is lighter than water . \nThe uncertainty in measuring the total size of the spill is harming BP , Professor Maitland warns . \n`` It depletes confidence that BP have complete control of what is going on and their ability to collect the oil or cap it eventually .

'' \nIn response to the speech , BP said in a statement that it shared Mr Obama 's goal of cleaning up the oil spill and helping the people affected by it . \nThe firm said it was looking forward to Wednesday 's meeting `` for a constructive discussion about how best to achieve these mutual goals '' . \nIn the UK , Prime Minister David Cameron told the BBC that while BP would pay `` reasonable '' compensation claims , the firm needed `` certainty '' over the level of its liabilities . \n`` This is BP 's worry , that there wo n't be claims entertained that are three or four times removed from the oil spill , '' Mr Cameron said . \nPresident Obama : `` We will make BP pay for the damage '' Estimates of how much oil is gushing out of the well have again risen dramatically . \nA government panel of scientists now believes 35,000-60 ,000 barrels are leaking each day , up from its estimate last week of 20,000-40 ,000 . \nBP managed to place a cap over the leaking oil pipe earlier this month , and is now collecting some of the oil . \nOn Wednesday the company said it had begun operating a second containment system designed to bring oil and gas to the surface for burning , in an effort to increase the amount of oil that can be dealt with each day . \nIn his address , Mr Obama described the spill as an assault on the shores and citizens of the US that tested the limits of human technology . \n`` We will fight this spill with everything we 've got for as long it takes , '' he said . \nWe will fight this spill with everything we 've got for as long it takes '' End Quote President Barack Obama And he said it demonstrated the need to end the US `` addiction '' to fossil fuels and embark on a future fuelled by clean energy . \n`` I say we ca n't afford not to change how we produce and use energy - because the long-term costs to our economy , our national security , and our environment are far greater , '' he said . \nBut he gave few details and made no pledges about specific legislation , instead promising to look at ideas from Republicans and Democrats on the issue . \nPresidents use Oval Office addresses for what they regard as vital national issues . \nThe speech came as opinion polls suggest a majority of Americans disapprove of how Mr Obama has handled the crisis - the worst environmental disaster in US history . \nThe Republicans were quick to criticise the address , with party chairman Michael Steele accusing Mr Obama of exploiting the crisis for his own political gain . \nYou can follow the testimony of BP chief executive Tony Hayward when he appears before a US Congress committee on the BBC News website on Thursday 17 June , from 1400GMT -LRB- 1000 EST -RRB- . \nChannel 4 News Congress attacks Tony Hayward over BP oil spill - 41 mins ago Sky News BP Boss Heckled Then ` Stonewalls ' US Panel - 1 hr ago The Economist \\* BP and the oil spill : The oil well and the damage done - 1 hr ago The Independent BP chief Tony Hayward heckled by protester at US hearing - 2 hrs ago CNBC via MSN Money BP agrees to $ 20 billion fund for spill claims - 2 hrs ago The pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ? \n"}

'' \nA BP spokesman says Mr Hayward had not had a break since the spill began and was merely `` spending a few hours with his family at the weekend '' . \nIn a nationally broadcast TV advertisement , Mr Hayward pledges : `` For those affected and your families , I 'm deeply sorry . \nWe will make this right . '' \nTony Hayward apologises for the oil spill on the BP website He also promises BP would clean up every drop of oil and `` restore the shoreline to its original state '' . \nPresident Barack Obama says the following day that the $ 50m spent by BP on the campaign and allocated dividends should have instead gone towards the clean-up operation and compensating devastated local businesses . \n`` What I do n't wanna hear is when they 're spending that kind of money on their shareholders and spending that kind of money on TV advertising that they 're nickel and diming fishermen . '' \nAsked what he would tell people in Louisiana , where oil had begun to reach parts of the state 's south-eastern marshes , Mr Hayward tells reporters : `` The first thing to say is I 'm sorry . '' \n`` We 're sorry for the massive disruption it 's caused their lives . \nThere 's no one who wants this over more than I do . \nI would like my life back . '' \nThe statement was particularly criticised given that eleven people died in the drilling platform explosion that caused the spill . \nIn an interview with Sky News , Mr Hayward says he is not overly concerned by the amount of oil that is flowing into the Gulf of Mexico . \n`` I think the environmental impact of this disaster is likely to be very , very modest . \nIt is impossible to say and we will mount , as part of the aftermath , a very detailed environmental assessment as we go forward . \nWe 're going to do that with some of the science institutions in the US . '' \n`` But everything we can see at the moment suggests that the overall environmental impact of this will be very , very modest . '' \nIn an interview with the Guardian , Mr Hayward insists the leaked oil and the dispersant that is being released into the sea to try to tackle the slick should be put in context . \n`` The Gulf of Mexico is a very big ocean . \nThe amount of volume of oil and dispersant we are putting into it is tiny in relation to the total water volume . '' \nIn an interview with NBC , Mr Hayward insists BP was not at fault for the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon on 20 April and the subsequent oil spill . \n`` Well , it was n't our accident , but we are absolutely responsible for the oil , for cleaning it up , and that 's what we intend to do .

'' \n`` With respect , sir , we drill hundreds of wells a year around the world , '' he informed Republican committee member Michael Burgess . \n`` Yes I know , Mr Burgess replied dryly , `` That 's what 's scaring me right now . '' \nOver and over , the BP chief refused to agree with the conclusions of a group of angry , hostile Congressmen and women who seemed in no doubt , after their own lengthy enquiries , that BP had shown a reckless lack of attention to safety , Paul Adams reports . \nInfuriated by Mr Hayward 's inability or unwillingness to answer their questions , committee members resorted to expressing their disgust , more than one saying he felt insulted . \nEleven people died in the Deepwater Horizon drill rig accident , which left a ruptured well spewing hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico . \nDespite BP efforts to contain the leak , oil continues to enter the sea , threatening states along the Gulf coast . \nBP says it will withhold dividends until the end of the year as part of its response to the spill . \nThe long-term hope for ending the spill rests with two relief wells now being drilled , one of which has reached two miles -LRB- 3km -RRB- below the seabed , or about two-thirds of its way to its target , US disaster coordinator Admiral Thad Allen reported on Thursday . \nIt is planned is to seal the leak with concrete but that is not likely to happen until August at the earliest . \nBP 's shares rose more than 6 % after it agreed to put $ 20bn -LRB- # 13.5 bn -RRB- in a fund to compensate victims of the spill . \nThe increase halted falls that had led to the company 's stock value halving in recent weeks . \nCongressman Waxman said in his opening remarks that BP had `` cut corner after corner '' in order to save money , which led to the explosion and fire on board the Deepwater Horizon . \n`` We could find no evidence that you paid any attention to the tremendous risks BP was taking , '' he went on . \nThis is going very badly for Mr Hayward and for BP '' End Quote Mark Mardell BBC North America editor `` We reviewed 30,000 pages of documents from BP , including your e-mails . \nThere is not a single e-mail or document that shows you paid even the slightest attention to the dangers at this well .

'' \n`` Yeah , that 's what scares me right now , '' said Mr Burgess . \nA row erupted within Republican ranks after another Texan Republican , Joe Barton , suggested BP had been subjected to a `` $ 20bn shakedown '' by the Obama administration . \nMr Barton , the senior Republican on Mr Waxman 's committee , was rebuked by his own party leaders and retracted his words , the Associated Press reports . \n`` I regret the impact that my statement this morning implied that BP should not pay for the consequences of their decisions and actions in this incident , '' he said in a statement . \nEarlier , as Mr Hayward prepared to testify , a protester briefly disrupted the hearing , shouting that he should be `` charged with a crime '' before she was removed . \nShe was identified as Diane Wilson , a fisherwoman from Seadrift , Texas , near the Gulf Coast . \nExpressing his `` deep regret '' for the spill , Mr Hayward repeatedly stressed he was constrained in what he could say by the fact that a number of investigations into the explosion had yet to finish . \n`` There is nothing I have seen so far that suggests that anyone put costs ahead of safety , '' he said at one point . \n`` If there are , then we 'll take action .

'' \nBP said it would continue to co-operate with government inquiries and fulfil its commitments to clean up spilt oil in the Gulf . \nHalliburton , the company that cemented the Macondo well , and Cameron International , which provided equipment for the well , was not targeted in the lawsuit . \nTransocean disputed the charges brought by the government , saying that it should not be held liable for the actions of others . \n`` No drilling contractor has ever been held liable for discharges from a well under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 , '' the company said in a statement . \n`` The responsibility for hydrocarbons discharged from a well lies solely with its owner and operator .

'' \nHe added : `` With the emergency payments ... you 've got to allow those payments to go out with less corroboration than you would if you 're giving a lump-sum payment that is the total compensation . \n`` For the emergency payments , we 've got to err on the side of the claimant . '' \nMr Feinberg has said that individuals and businesses affected by the spill can file a claim for compensation for lost wages or profits , personal injuries or even death . \nHis latest comments came after BP said that its costs so far of tackling the oil spill and compensating victims had risen to $ 2bn , including $ 105m paid out to 32,000 claimants . \nOn 20 April , when the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded , the blowout preventer -LRB- BOP -RRB- device failed . \nThe most critical piece of safety equipment on the rig , it is designed to avert disasters just like the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . \nThe blowout preventer has giant shears designed to cut and seal off the well 's main pipe . \nThe control pods are effectively the brains of the blowout preventer and contain both electronics and hydraulics . \nThis is where Mr Benton said the problem had been found . \n`` We saw a leak on the pod , so by seeing the leak we informed the company men , '' Mr Benton said of the earlier problem he had identified . \n`` They have a control room where they could turn off that pod and turn on the other one , so that they do n't have to stop production . '' \nMr Benton said his supervisor e-mailed both BP and Transocean , the owner of the rig , about the leaks when they were discovered . \nHe said he did not know whether the leaking pod had been turned back on before the disaster or not . \nHe said to repair the control pod would have meant temporarily stopping drilling work on the rig at a time when it was costing BP $ 500,000 -LRB- # 337,000 -RRB- a day to operate the Deepwater Horizon rig . \nHenry Waxman , a House of Representatives Democrat who is overseeing congressional investigations into the rig disaster , has accused BP of taking safety shortcuts to save money . \nBP - In Deep Water , BBC One , Monday , 21 June at 2030 BST Then available in the UK via the link below `` BP appears to have made multiple decisions for economic reasons that increased the danger of a catastrophic well failure , '' Mr Waxman said . \nBP chief executive Tony Hayward , giving evidence to Congress , said : `` There is nothing I have seen in the evidence so far that suggests that anyone put cost ahead of safety - if there are then we will take action . '' \nCongress has identified numerous other problems with the blowout preventer , including design problems , unexpected modifications and a flat battery . \nEnd Quote Robert Peston BBC business editor The other major problems on the rig , Congress has said , centred on the cement job . \nCement in an oil well blocks explosive gases from escaping , and it appears the cement may not have been set properly on the Deepwater Horizon platform . \nBP said it had had indications of a successful cementing operation and the company that was in charge of the cement job , Halliburton , has said it was consistent with that used in similar applications . \nThe BBC spoke to several rig workers who were on the Deepwater Horizon rig and they said there had been pressure in April to work fast . \nWork to prepare and then seal the well was behind schedule and had to be completed before a production rig could move in and start turning profits . \n`` Too many jobs were being done at one time . \nIt should have just really slowed down and just took one job at a time , to make sure everything was done the way it should have been , '' said Mr Benton , who is now suing BP and Transocean for negligence . \nBP has responded to Mr Benton 's account saying Transocean was responsible for both the maintenance and operation of the blowout preventer . \nThe pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ? \n"}
{"id": "1619", "time": "2010-06-21", "text": "BP 's chief executive Tony Hayward has been under fire The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has been made worse for BP by the public-relation gaffes of those in charge of the company . \nA few misplaced words can cause a lot of damage , so why are they getting them so wrong ? \nThere 's a chronic foot-in-mouth outbreak at BP and it does n't look like it will be clearing up anytime soon . \nChief executive Tony Hayward has already been dubbed `` wayward Hayward '' by the media for his gaffes when speaking about the company 's massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . \nEven when he says very little , he gets it all wrong . \nFacing US politicians in Washington last week he was repeatedly criticised for dodging questions . \nOne frustrated congressman accused him of `` just kicking the can down the road like you have nothing to do with it '' . \n`` The Gulf of Mexico is a very big ocean '' - Tony Hayward `` There 's no one who wants this over more than I do - I would like my life back '' - Tony Hayward `` We care about the small people '' - Carl-Henric Svanberg He 's not the only one at BP to be struck down by the complaint . \nChairman Carl-Henric Svanberg also attracted criticism last week when he referred to those affected by the spill as `` the small people '' . \nHe apologised , saying his words were `` clumsy '' . \nCrises are unpredictable , but they are not unexpected . \nA good company prepares for the unexpected and a good PR team is poised to do damage limitation . \nSo why is BP getting it so wrong ? \n`` BP 's communication over the oil spill has often been inexplicable and at times simply shocking , '' says Sharon Francis , chief executive of Media First , specialists in communication training . \n`` You 'd think those in charge of one of the world 's biggest companies would know better than most that one stupid comment travels round the world in a nanosecond . \n`` BP was slow reacting to what happened and failed to express appropriate concern and compassion , which is vital . \nAs a consequence , any apology now just seems hollow . '' \nBP initially appeared to understate the extent of the situation , with Mr Hayward saying the spill would not be a major problem because the gulf was `` a very big ocean '' . \nContrition and reparation are called for , says Professor Stephen Brammer , who lectures on corporate reputation at Bath University . \n`` Say you are sorry as quickly as you can and tell the world what you are doing to put things right , '' he says . \nShow empathy with those affected Often over reaction is what 's needed , not trying to play things down . \nIn 1982 seven people in Chicago died after taking poisoned Tylenol tablets . \nJohnson & Johnson reacted quickly , including a huge US-wide recall of the product - some 31 million bottles - at an estimated cost of $ 100 million . \n`` A nationwide recall probably was n't needed , but it showed that the company was putting protecting the public above profit , '' says Mr Brammer . \nIt 's also crucial to express empathy and that you understand the people affected . \nSo far Mr Hayward 's biggest gaffe has been saying he wanted the crisis to end so he could have his `` life back '' . \nHe later apologised and said the remark had been `` hurtful and thoughtless '' , especially to the families of the 11 men who died when the well exploded . \n`` No one cares how the crisis is personally affecting the life of the head of BP , '' says Prof Brammer . \n`` Getting his life back probably means being able to drop his kids off at school again or take his wife out for dinner . \nIt was a stupid thing to say when he is dealing with such a catastrophe . '' \nThis series of public-relation gaffes meant Mr Hayward reportedly received intensive training for his appearance before addressing US politicians at a Congressional hearing in Washington last week . \nIt did n't help , say critics . \nHe was accused of dodging questions , the assumption being that he had been briefed by BP 's lawyers not to accept any responsibility . \nBut that does n't mean you simply shut down , says Mr Brammer . \n`` Trying to dodge things is ridiculous , it 's never a good reputation-management strategy . \nEven when you do not want to accept responsibility , you can distinguish between the legal and the moral . \nIt is never good to use the legal mechanism to prevent discourse . '' \nMedia consultants say BP has also suffered hugely because it has too few Americans leading its communications strategy . \nThis has been extremely costly because Britain and America may speak the same language , but they use it very differently . \n`` BP 's communication has been done in a very British way , it has been very self-deprecating , '' says Ms Francis . \n`` Americans do n't deal in such language , they do n't see themselves as ` little people ' - they are a can-do culture . '' \nSo why did a such a big company get it so wrong ? \nMost companies have strategies in place to deal with a crisis , say communication consultants . \nBut that 's not enough , they should have regular `` risk audits '' to make sure plans are up to date and not just `` filed away and forgotten '' . \nIt 's also should n't have a one-size-fits-all approach . \n`` I think that has been BP 's downfall , '' says Ms Francis . \n`` Situations vary and companies should adapt , like getting American PR people in to help in the case of BP . '' \nSo is there any way back for BP ? \nPossibly , but it will take years of the right action and words . \n`` It 's going to be facing a reputation issue for years , but it is possible to rebuild things , '' says Jonathan Hemus , crisis-management expert with Insignia communications . \n`` Other companies should look and learn from all of this .

{"id": "46", "time": "2010-06-17", "text": "By Jamie Robertson Presenter , BBC World News With its chief executive under fire during his appearence before US lawmakers this week , it ca n't be that much of a surprise that BP has lost its position , with its share price down by more than a third . \nShell has taken its place , which has a certain irony since BP overtook Shell as Europe 's largest oil company just before the Gulf oil spill . \nBP was cutting costs faster and more aggressively and reaping the rewards . \nAll that is rather academic now , and Shell 's investors are the happier bunch : for starters , they have a dividend , and they do n't have an oil spill . \nHowever , it is worth remembering that Shell is the second largest oil producer in the Gulf of Mexico , and although it and the other `` Big Oil '' brethren swear blind that the Gulf spill would never have happened on one of their rigs , offshore drilling could face serious obstacles . \nWhile the oil companies have been facing up to lower oil prices as the global economy makes its painful recovery , the miners have been ratcheting up their prices , thanks to China 's economy resuming its upward trajectory . \nThe king of the commodities is gold , with the yellow metal regularly testing new highs . \nSo Barrick Gold of Canada , the world 's largest gold miner , has stepped confidently into the Global 30 . \nBarrick 's profits doubled in the first quarter of this year , although the company claims it is not just the gold price that has pushed up its shares , but increased margins , reduced costs , and a pile of new projects ready to go . \nThe market has also been rumoring it is ready for a big merger - possibly with Australia 's Lihir Gold . \nRio Tinto also enters the index while BHP Billiton has moved out . \nThere 's no dramatic change here . \nThe two are evenly balanced ; both face the 40 % supertax being wielded by the Australian government , and both have massive international commodity operations , although Rio is bigger in iron ore and aluminium while BHP offers oil and gas exposure which Rio does n't have . \nAll the same , Rio 's shares have outperformed BHP 's since it abandoned the sale of a $ US19 .5 bn -LRB- # 13.2 bn -RRB- stake to its Chinese customer Chinalco . \nIt instead opted for a $ 15.2 bn rights issue and asset sales worth more than $ 10bn , which put its balance sheet on a more stable footing . \nBut its expansion plans are less impressive than BHP 's . \nRio expects to spend US$ 5-6bn compared with BHP 's US$ 11.5 bn . \nSo BHP 's absence from the index may be short lived . \nThe other big arrival in the Global 30 is Berkshire Hathaway in the financial sector . \nWarren Buffet 's investment vehicle is an anomaly : while it is one of the 20 biggest companies on the US market , the shares have been notoriously illiquid , not even meriting a place on the S&P 500 . \nBut its biggest acquisition ever , of the US railway company Burlington Northern , forced it to split its B shares into 50 - Burlington shareholders would n't accept anything bigger . \nThe surge in liquidity has given it an entree into global indices , and its value as an economic indicator , with its spread of business investments in everything from insurance to retail and manufacturing , is obvious : so optimists on the economy can take comfort from the fact that in the first quarter it bounced back from last year 's loss to report US$ 3.6 billion in net income . \nDiversification is a good bet in wild times . \nMobile phone firm Nokia has lost out to competitors such as Apple The Australian Wesfarmers group has also been gathering together a broad range of businesses - retail , hardware , resources , insurance and chemicals . \nThat 's protected the share price but it 's primarily in the Global 30 thanks to the turnaround of its Coles retail operation , which it bought back in 2007 in Australia 's biggest take-over yet . \nNow it 's thought to be looking for more acquisitions . \nThe world slowdown does n't really seem to apply to electronics , where the pace seems as feverish as ever . \nSamsung is back in the Global 30 thanks to a rebound in chip sales as customers started to buy PCs again . \nNokia is out as investors grow ever more impatient with its failure to find a credible competitor to Apple 's iPhone . \nSamsung came up with the Galaxy S , and it is staking much of its fortunes on tripling its 5 % smartphone market share this year . \nThe competition is cut throat as ever and one gets the impression that no one gets to stay as top dog for long - something that may well apply to global markets as a whole next year as well as this . \nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external Internet sites The pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ? \n"}

\nQuite simply , it means investors will not get any regular payments this year from owning BP shares . \nThat includes the first quarter dividend -LRB- about 9.5 pence per share -RRB- which had been due to be paid on 21 June and would have cost the company about $ 2.6 bn . \nThis will clearly disappoint BP shareholders , some of whom may have chosen BP because , in the past , it has been a regular dividend payer . \nThe last time that BP suspended a dividend payment was during World War II . \nThere wil be no second or third quarter dividends this year . \nPayments to shareholders may possibly resume for the fourth quarter of 2010 , which will become payable in early 2011 . \nI 'm saving into a pension . \nWill this affect me ? \nMany BP shareholders will be pension funds . \nSo the fall in the value of its shares and the axing of the dividend will have an impact . \nThe question is how big . \nPension funds nowadays only have about 25 % of their money invested in UK shares -LRB- most of which is in the FTSE 100 index -RRB- . \nThe rest is in the likes of overseas shares and bonds . \nThe National Association of Pension Funds -LRB- NAPF -RRB- , which represents a large part of the UK pension industry , estimates that 1.5 % of members ' money is invested in BP . \nYou could use the same sort of rough arithmetic on dividend income , too . \n# 1 in every # 7 of dividend income from FTSE 100 companies comes from BP . \nBut , as described above , pension funds have many more sources of income than just the FTSE 100 . \nBP 's own research says it accounts for 8 % of UK pension fund income . \nI have already retired . \nCould my pension be affected , too ? \nIf you are already receiving your pension after saving hard for years , recent falls in BP shares or the suspension in the dividend will not affect the income you receive . \nThat 's the same whether you are in your former employer 's final-salary scheme , which guarantees to pay a percentage of your last salary , or if you have already bought an annuity with a private pension pot . \nIt wo n't , of course , affect the state pension either . \nAnd if you are nearing retirement , do n't forget that most personal pension funds switch out of shares as retirement draws near . \nBP is likely to feature in a wide range of popular investments , from FTSE 100 index tracker funds , which are far and away the most popular type of share investment , to unit trusts and Child Trust Funds . \nYou may well have exposure without knowing it . \nSo is it time to sell my BP shares or get out of related investments ? \nA decision for you , I 'm afraid , and not something we can advise on . \nBear in mind some investments may incur penalties if you want to get your money out early . \nDid BP scrap the dividend because it could not afford it anymore ? \nBP decided not to pay dividends in 2010 for several reasons . \nThe key one is that it has agreed to pay $ 5bn into the compensation fund annually over four years . \nBP has a strong balance sheet with relatively low levels of borrowing , therefore paying $ 20bn into an escrow fund over several years is affordable . \nHad it been forced to put all the money into a fund immediately , this would have weakened the company very considerably , BBC business editor Robert Peston said . \nIt should be remembered too , that the $ 20bn is not the most it can be liable for . \nIt is possible that the compensation it must pay out - a process likely to last for years - will exceed that level . \nSome observers say it there is also an issue of trying to limit damage to its image - arguing it should not be seen to rewarding investors while many in the US are losing their livelihoods as a result of the spill . \nThe pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ?

'' \nMr Svanberg was also forced to apologise after telling reporters that BP was not a greedy company and that it cared `` about the small people '' . \nHe later said he `` spoke clumsily '' . \nThe last time that BP suspended a dividend payment was during World War II . \nThe company was due to make a $ 2.6 bn dividend payment on Monday , which has now been canceled . \nIn addition , BP said it would sell off `` non-core '' assets worth some $ 10bn in an attempt to cut costs in the coming year . \nBP 's chief executive , Briton Tony Hayward , and the boss of BP America , Lamar McKay , accompanied Mr Svanberg to the White House . \nMr Hayward , who has come under heavy criticism for his handling of the crisis , is scheduled to give evidence to a US House of Representatives committee on Thursday . \nThere remains some confusion over how far the definition of `` legitimate responsibilities '' should stretch . \nEarlier in the day UK Prime Minister David Cameron said BP was concerned the claims could be submitted `` three or four times removed '' from the spill . \nThe company has been accused of failing to follow proper procedures in the run-up to the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig on 20 April . \nThe blast led to the deaths of 11 people , caused the rig to sink and has since seen hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil spew into the Gulf of Mexico . \nSets salary limits at financial firms on federal bailout funds Oversaw funds after 9\\/11 terror attacks and 2007 Virginia Tech shooting Set fair market value of the `` Zapruder film '' of 1963 Kennedy assassination Assistant to Senator Edward Kennedy , 1977-1979 Some of that oil is now washing ashore in states along the Gulf coast . \nThe fallout is affecting businesses and wildlife , as well as wiping billions of dollars off BP 's value . \nBP 's share price rose in US trading after an earlier slump as news of the funding deal emerged , but dipped as the day wore on and more details emerged . \nIn its latest effort to contain the oil spewing into the Gulf of Mexico , BP announced on Wednesday morning that it had begun operating a second containment system designed to bring oil and gas to the surface for burning . \nBP managed to place a cap over the leaking oil pipe earlier this month , and is now collecting some of the oil . \nHowever , estimates of how much oil is gushing out of the well have again risen dramatically since the start of the crisis . \nA government panel of scientists now believes 35,000-60 ,000 barrels are leaking each day , up from its estimate last week of 20,000-40 ,000 . \nYou can follow the testimony of BP chief executive Tony Hayward when he appears before a US Congress committee on the BBC News website on Thursday 17 June , from 1400 BST -LRB- 1000 EST -RRB- . \nTelegraph \\* BP oil spill : costs could spiral up to $ 100bn - 2 hrs ago Canada.com to suspend dividend , sell US$ 10-billion in assets - 10 hrs ago Economic Times BP begins to ante up - 11 hrs ago USA Today OBAMA : BP plans $ 20B fund for oil workers - 11 hrs ago France24 OIL SPILL : BP chief Hayward vows to fix Gulf Coast spill - 12 hrs ago The pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ? \n"}

'' \nMr Martinez continued : `` No kind of alarms . \nWe did n't hear any kind of alarms until there was one explosion . '' \nThe accounts , from BP 's own investigations into the blast last month , describe how the blow-out was triggered by a bubble of methane gas that escaped from the well and shot up the drill column , AP reports . \nIt rapidly expanded as it burst through several seals and barriers before exploding , the documents say . \nDetails of the documents were revealed by Robert Bea , a University of California Berkeley engineering professor , who has worked for BP as a risk assessment consultant . \nBP spokesman John Curry would not comment on the events described in the internal documents . \n`` We anticipate all the facts will come out in a full investigation , '' he said . \nUS officials announced on Friday that they had closed Breton National Wildlife Refuge to the public after a silver sheen of oil reached the shoreline . \n`` The refuge closure is important to keep the public safe , to minimize disturbance to nesting colonial sea birds , and to allow personnel conducting cleanup operations and recovery efforts to work safely and efficiently , '' the US Fish and Wildlife Service said on Friday . \nThe BBC 's Rajesh Mirchandani , on Dauphin Island , an inhabited barrier island three miles -LRB- 5km -RRB- off the coast of Alabama , says there is a faint but distinct smell of oil in the air . \nSome scientists say the oil may be spread more widely . \nSmall , black particles have been found in samples taken from below the surface , away from the visible slick , our correspondent adds . \nAn estimated 5,000 barrels of oil a day has been leaking for 18 days from the well , 50 miles off Louisiana , since an explosion destroyed the Deepwater Horizon rig last month , killing 11 workers . \nAlthough the rig was operated by Transocean , it was leased by BP , which is responsible for cleaning the 3 million gallons that have so far leaked , creating a slick covering about 2,000 sq miles -LRB- 5,200 sq km -RRB- . \nThe company hopes the 98-tonne containment device , once operational , will allow it to collect oil leaking out of the well while it attempts to stop the leak altogether by drilling relief wells nearby . \nHOW THE OIL FUNNEL WORKS The funnel is a 40ft tall iron box , weighing 98 tonnes It will be placed over the leak , 5,000 ft down on the seabed BP hopes it will collect 85 % of the leaking oil and pipe it to the surface Earlier , remote-controlled submersibles guided the 40ft -LRB- 12m -RRB- funnel above the wellhead , some 5,000 ft below the surface . \nThe technology has only ever been used in shallow waters . \n`` It appears to be going exactly as we hoped , '' BP spokesman Bill Salvin told the Associated Press . \n`` Still lots of challenges ahead , but this is very good progress . '' \nNow that the containment device is on the seafloor , workers will need at least 12 hours to let it settle and make sure it is stable before the submersibles can hook up a pipe and hose that will funnel the oil up to a tanker . \n`` We are essentially taking a four-story building and lowering it 5,000 ft and setting it on the head of a pin , '' Mr Salvin added . \nIf the box works , another will be dropped onto a second , smaller leak . \nExperts warn that there is still a risk that any wrong move could damage the leaking pipe and make the problem worse . \nIt is also possible for the pipe to the surface to become clogged with ice , and for the subsequent separation of the oil , gas and water to cause an explosion . \nFears are growing for the safety of the area 's manifest wildlife In the meantime , residents of Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama , and Florida await news of when the oil will reach their shores . \nBP said emergency teams had been sent to Freemason Island , a favorite fishing spot for recreational anglers some 30 miles off Louisiana 's coast , to deploy inflatable booms to protect its prime marshland . \nFears are growing that sea life may have been severely affected in the area , which includes vital spawning grounds for fish , shrimp and crabs . \nThe attempt by BP to lower the funnel comes as Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar called for a halt to permits for new exploratory drilling in the US , pending a 30-day investigation into the cause of the oil spill . \nSome environmentalists are now calling for a permanent ban on offshore drilling as a result of the spill . \n"}

'' \nAttempt to cap oil leak The latest stage in BP 's efforts to contain leaking oil has involved lowering a cap onto the failed blowout preventer -LRB- BOP -RRB- valve system on the seabed . \nThe cap sits on the BOP 's lower marine riser package -LRB- LMRP -RRB- section . \nFirst , the damaged riser - the pipe which takes oil from the well - was cut where it nears the seabed using a remotely-operated shear . \nThis was completed at 1930 CDT on 1 June -LRB- 0030 GMT 2 June -RRB- . \nThe next stage was for a diamond wire cutter to saw through the riser close to the LMRP . \nThe blade got stuck and had to be removed but BP eventually cut through the pipe using giant shears manipulated by undersea robots -LRB- ROV -RRB- . \nAfter removing the pipe , the cap was lowered onto the LMRP enabling the leaking oil and gas to be funnelled to a drill ship on the surface . \nLatest estimates suggest more than half of the leaking oil is now being captured . \nBACK -LCB- current -RCB- of -LCB- total -RCB- NEXT The pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ? \n"}

'' \nHe added that `` constructive solutions '' were needed , emphasising that people `` remember the economic value BP brings to people in Britain and America '' . \nThe US is considering taking legal action to prevent BP paying dividends . \nAnd concern has been expressed by MPs about the damage that such action could do to one of the UK 's top companies . \nHowever the UK government has played down fears expressed by some senior figures of `` anti-British rhetoric '' in the US . \nThe US state department has said the oil spill will not affect the relationship between the US and Britain . \nBP 's shares recovered some of the losses during London trading hours to end 6.6 % lower at 365.5 pence . \nThe recent price moves mean the oil giant 's share price has almost halved since the Deepwater Horizon oil spill began on 20 April . \nThe company has come under increasingly sharp attack by some US politicians for its handling of the spill , described as the worst environmental disaster the US has faced . \nSome of the sharpest comments have come from President Obama , who said he was looking for `` ass to kick '' at BP , and that he would have sacked BP chief executive Tony Hayward - if he worked for him - over flippant comments about the scale of the spill . \nRobert Peston Business editor , BBC News Overnight , the US Justice Department said it was examining ways of forcing BP to suspend its dividend until BP 's full liability for the oil spill is known with more precision . \nAnd the Justice Department is only doing what influential US politicians are demanding . \nWhich is a serious concern to BP , in that it may be a British company by dint of history and legal domicile , but it is very American by virtue of its giant acquisitions of a decade or so ago . \nMy conversations with those at the top of BP indicate that they 're increasingly minded to go for a voluntary moratorium on dividend payments , to bring some kind of fragile truce to hostilities with the US government . \nBut President Obama should be aware that such a suspension of dividends would in effect deprive US savers of some $ 4bn of income per annum . \nOr to put it another way , in a world of global capitalism , Obama ca n't punish BP and expect all or even most of the pain to be felt in Britain . \nLondon Mayor Boris Johnson told the BBC that BP had paid a `` very , very heavy price '' , and expressed concern that the oil spill was beginning to damage the entire image of the UK in the US . \n`` I do think there 's something slightly worrying about the anti-British rhetoric that seems to be permeating from America , '' he told BBC Radio 4 's Today program . \nHowever , UK Foreign Secretary William Hague has downplayed the extent of anti-British feelings across the Atlantic . \n`` No-one has used an anti-British tone in anything that I 've detected , '' he told the BBC . \nAnd Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg also played down the prospect of UK-US relations being damaged . \n`` It is about dealing with the ecological problem and dealing with it as soon as possible , '' he said . \nHowever the former British ambassador to the US , Sir Christopher Meyer , told the BBC that the BP issue had become `` a bit of a crisis , politically '' . \n`` The government must put down a marker with the US administration that the survival and long-term prosperity of BP is a vital British interest , '' he said . \nHe added that with nearly 40 % of BP shares held in the US the company was `` a pretty vital American interest too , fully integrated into US energy infrastructure '' . \nAnd the remarks by President Obama prompted Royal Sun Alliance chairman John Napier to write an open letter to the president , saying criticism of the company lacked `` balance '' and was `` unstatesmanlike '' . \nHe told the BBC : `` The language and rhetoric of this dispute is going into the danger zone , is becoming too highly personalised and to that extent , the interpretation over here , not just by me but others , is that it has a certain anti-British rhetoric to it - and that has to be of concern . '' \nUS Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said that BP should compensate other oil companies that have had to lay off workers because of a moratorium on deep sea drilling announced by President Obama in response to the Gulf of Mexico spill . \nMeanwhile , the US Attorney General said he could not rule out taking action to force BP to withhold its next dividend payment - something which former Foreign Secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind said was `` quite intolerable '' . \nThe drop in BP 's share price is already bad news for UK pension funds , which invest heavily in the firm . \nThe oil company has said that it pays # 1 in every # 7 of dividends that pension funds receive from FTSE 100 companies . \nHowever the National Association of Pension Funds -LRB- NAPF -RRB- has insisted that BP 's woes `` should not have an immediate or serious impact on those saving into a pension , or on those who have retired '' . \nCable : `` I do n't want to get into the business of lecturing the American government '' It added that pension funds have shifted out of UK shares and that the average fund was now spread across many companies and many types of global asset . \nIn its latest update on the spill , BP sought to reassure investors that it was on a strong financial footing with a stronger-than-forecast cash flow . \nIt also said that the total actual cost to date was some $ 1.43 bn -LRB- # 1bn -RRB- . \nThis compares with a total of # 55bn that has been wiped off BP 's value since the spill began . \nMarket nerves have also been reflected in the value of BP 's bonds , which now trade at levels comparable with junk-rated companies . \nThis is despite the company continuing to enjoy high `` investment grade '' ratings from all three major ratings agencies . \nco. uk Scientists warn BP spill could be double initial estimates - 1 hr ago Guardian . \nco. uk BP oil spill : Nick Clegg pledges to avoid ` megaphone diplomacy ' with US - 3 hrs ago Marketing Week \\* BP brand faces further damage as oil crisis deepens - 4 hrs ago Philadelphia Inquirer As BP sinks , Britons worry - 6 hrs ago RTE Online Cameron urged to intervene in BP row - 8 hrs ago The pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ? \n"}

'' \nBP 's US assets are the result of mergers and takeovers of American companies . \nBP 's international expansion was one reason why dropping the name `` British '' made sense . \nSo , Sir Christopher said : `` BP is a pretty vital American interest - fully integrated into US energy infrastructure '' . \nAnd while the company may be based in London , and have a British chief executive , Tony Hayward , 39 % of BP 's shares are held by US institutions and individuals , according to figures on the oil giant 's website . \nAbout 40 % of the shares are UK-owned . \nMany observers believe the Obama administration 's recent harder line on BP has much to do with criticism of the president 's handling of the crisis and forthcoming elections . \nFurthermore , there appears little evidence that anti-British , as opposed to anti-BP , sentiment is widespread in grassroots America . \nAn - admittedly unscientific - trawl through various newspaper websites and blogs in Louisiana and beyond found no suggestion that the `` British '' were to blame . \nAs one oil industry analyst , who asked not to be named , told the BBC : `` I bet there was more anti-Yank feeling here when Kraft bought Cadbury than there is anti-Brit feeling in America over the oil spill . '' \nBP chief Tony Hayward has become a lightening rod for abuse and ridicule Prime Minister David Cameron is expected to raise the use of Mr Obama 's aggressive rhetoric during a regular telephone conversation with the president this weekend . \nBut the Foreign Secretary , William Hague , said on Thursday that he was not aware of any anti-British sentiment generated by the Gulf of Mexico disaster . \nEven so , some experts believe Mr Hayward should have kept a lower profile during the crisis , and left BP 's US executives to take the lead . \nJohn Hofmeister , former president of Shell Oil , the US subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell , said : `` I think it was a mistake for Tony Hayward to come and put his physical presence in the US . \n`` The US has its own culture and traditions . \nForeign companies can come and do business there , but they are not necessarily welcomed . '' \nMr Hofmeister agreed that Mr Hayward was `` damned if he did and damned if he did n't '' go to America . \nBut the former Shell executive added : `` BP has very senior executives in the US - Americans who are totally competent in what they do . \nI think it would be more appropriate for them to take the heat . \n`` There is something merciless about how the US political class will gang up on foreign business class . '' \nCritics of Mr Hayward say he has not distinguished himself during the disaster , making comments about `` wanting my life back '' and over-optimistic assessments about BP 's ability to contain the spillage . \nThe chief executive has become the lightening rod for abuse and ridicule , with chat show host Jay Leno summing up the mood when he called Mr Hayward `` Mr Haywire '' . \nBut , to paraphrase some of the Louisiana website comments : `` It 's not about being anti-British , it 's about being anti-incompetent .

{"id": "1329", "time": "2010-09-23", "text": "The escaping oil volume was calculated by studying high-resolution video clips US scientists who have analyzed videos of the oil gushing from the Deepwater Horizon well say about 4.4 million barrels of crude escaped into the Gulf . \nThis new figure is in good agreement with calculations produced by federal government advisers who used different estimation techniques . \nThe Columbia University team reports its findings to the journal Science . \nThey indicate the volume leaking from the well at one stage could have filled four Olympic-sized pools every day . \nMarine geophysicists Timothy Crone and Maya Tolstoy used a technique called optical plume velocimetry to study the oil escaping through the failed blowout preventer on the seafloor . \nThe technique analyses the images from video footage to gauge the velocity of flowing fluids . \nIt was originally devised by Dr Crone to study hydrothermal vents - volcanic areas in the deep ocean where super-heated waters are being spewed from cracks in the seabed . \nVelocimetry converts what is a flat , two-dimensional image in the video pictures into a volumetric flow rate . \n`` Using this optical image analysis method we can apply essentially a conversion factor for what the apparent motion is -LRB- in the video -RRB- and obtain what the average velocity is at the opening , '' explained Dr Crone . \n`` And if you know the average velocity at the opening , you can then multiply that by the area of the opening and that gets you the volume . \nThe work relies heavily on laboratory experiments which we have used to calibrate this method , '' he told BBC News . \nOne key assumption is the recognition that not all the plume seen in the video comprises oil . \nIt is thought only 40 % of it does , with the rest being gas and water . \nFor the Science study , the team assessed two short , high-resolution sequences of the BP Deepwater Horizon oil plume . \nThe impact on the economy and wildlife has yet to be fully assessed One of these 20-30-second sequences was taken while the collapsed riser pipe was still connected to the well 's blowout preventer . \nThe second sequence was taken after this riser pipe was cut and removed . \nCrone 's and Tolstoy 's analysis suggests that the average flow rate of oil from the well between 22 April -LRB- the day the Deepwater Horizon rig sank -RRB- and 3 June was 56,000 barrels per day . \nAfter the riser pipe was removed , the researchers say some 68,000 barrels of oil was flowing into the ocean each day , until the well was finally capped on 15 July . \nTheir total spill figure is 4.4 million barrels . \nThis number assumes constant flow rate and the subtraction of the 800,000 or so barrels BP managed to recover at the disaster site . \nThe researchers stress their figures have a large uncertainty of perhaps 20 % , but they compare well with the 4.1 million barrels estimate produced by the federal government 's Flow Rate Technical Group -LRB- again , taking account of the 800,000 barrels recovered by BP -RRB- . \nFour-point-four million barrels is 185 million US gallons , or just over 700,000 cubic metres . \nTo put it another way , the total volume is equivalent to about 280 Olympic-sized swimming pools -LRB- minimum specification -RRB- . \nThe explosion on the Deepwater Horizon killed 11 workers and injured 17 By comparison , the volume lost from the Exxon Valdez tanker in Alaska in 1989 , the largest previous US oil spill , amounted to 260,000 barrels . \n`` Our estimate should be viewed as preliminary , '' Dr Crone said . \n`` It was based on these two short clips . \nIt 's sort of a proof of concept . \nWhat we 'd like to do in the future is apply this technique to more videos - if they can be made available - to get a better estimate of how the flow rate changed over time . \nThis will help us narrow the uncertainties . '' \nCommenting on the research , Dr Simon Boxall , from the UK 's National Oceanography Centre , said the most important on-going issue remained not the size of the spill but its environmental impact . \n`` Whilst this may be the largest single marine spill of oil , it has not proven to be the most destructive , '' he explained . \n`` The depth of the spill , ocean conditions and the methods of coastal protection all helped to avoid catastrophic impact . \nSuch research methods have an important application in identifying spill rates in determining best practice during an incident ; but post-spill , it is the fate rather than volume of oil that still needs attention . '' \nThe federal government 's Flow Rate Technical Group estimated some 4.9 million barrels -LRB- see chart -RRB- came out of the well , with BP managing to capture only 800,000 barrels . \nThe pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ? \n"}

In simple language it 's a blame game Eleven people died when an explosion destroyed the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig on 20 April . \nSome 5,000 barrels -LRB- 210,000 gallons -RRB- of oil a day have been gushing into the sea since then , threatening the delicate ecosystem of the US Gulf coast . \nSoldiers using helicopters and bulldozers , helped by prison inmates , are battling to contain the slick . \nBP 's efforts to cap the well were set back at the weekend when a giant metal funnel lowered over the site suffered a build-up of ice-like crystals and had to be put aside . \nBP hopes to make a second attempt this week to seal the well . \nThe oil giant 's latest plan is to ram rubbish such as golf balls and shredded tyres into the leak to block the hole , says BBC North America editor Mark Mardell . \nThe broken pipe is almost a mile -LRB- 1.6 km -RRB- below the ocean 's surface , with little visibility for remote-controlled vehicles . \nA relief well is being drilled but may take up to three months to complete . \nIn Washington , BP , Transocean and a third firm , Halliburton , gave senators technical explanations of what went wrong . \nBut in simple language it was a blame game , our North America editor says . \nBooms have been partly successful although rough seas have washed oil over them Some controlled burning of oil has taken place , but it causes serious air pollution About 325,000 gallons of dispersant have been used , although scientists warn it may kill marine life A relief well is being drilled but could take many weeks A huge steel funnel suffered a build-up of ice-like crystals and had to be put aside Deepwater Horizon was owned and operated by Swiss-based Transocean , but was working on behalf of BP . \nLamar McKay , head of BP America , focused on a critical safety device , the 450-tonne blowout protector -LRB- BOP -RRB- . \nIt was supposed to shut off oil flow on the ocean floor in the event of a well blowout , but he said it had `` failed to operate '' . \nHe noted that BP had not owned the rig and so `` responsibility for the safety of drilling operations '' belonged to Transocean . \nBut Transocean chief executive Steven Newman said there was no reason to believe the BOP had been at fault . \n`` Offshore oil and gas production projects begin and end with the operator , in this case BP , '' he said . \nHe also pinned blame on the failure of a cement oil-well casing built by BP contractor Halliburton . \nHowever , Halliburton executive Tim Probert argued his firm had followed all requirements set out by BP and industry practices . \nSenate Energy Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman said the oil rig explosion had probably been due to a `` cascade of errors , technical , human and regulatory '' . \nThe BBC 's North America editor says the details of the engineering may be obscure , but the motivation is clear enough : no-one wants to say the loss of lives , the environmental impact or the economic effect was their fault . \nAccepting blame will have huge financial consequences . \nAnd President Obama wants new laws to lift the cap on how much firms are liable to pay for such disasters from millions to billions of dollars - and that would apply to this accident , our North America editor adds . \nAnnouncing a shake-up at the Minerals Management Service -LRB- MMS -RRB- , Interior Secretary Salazar said it was important to build `` a strong and independent organization holding energy companies accountable '' . \n`` The tragedy aboard the Deepwater Horizon and the massive spill for which BP is responsible has made the importance and urgency of our reform agenda even clearer , '' he added . \nCritics say the MMS - a branch of Mr Salazar 's Department of the Interior - has been riddled with conflicts of interest . \nThey argue that the two core responsibilities of the MMS are diametrically opposed - making money off the industry by collecting royalties , while cracking down on it in ways that may affect the industry 's bottom line . \nA 2008 internal investigation found some MMS employees had taken drugs and had sex with energy company representatives . \nSome staff had also accepted gifts and free holidays amid `` a culture of ethical failure '' , according to the investigation . \nThe interior secretary has been conducting a 30-day review of offshore drilling at the request of President Obama . \n"}

'' \nHuman hair , however , proved more effective - in part because the wool had been processed and so lost its lanolin coating , which naturally repels water and holds grease to keep sheep warm . \n`` Human hair grease acts as a spreading agent , to help the oil form a film on the surface . '' \nThe idea of using human hair to mop up oil spills dates from the Exxon Valdez accident in 1989 . \nWatching the unfolding disaster on television , Alabama hair stylist Phil McCory noticed how hard it was for volunteers to clean oil from otters ' fur , and thought to himself : `` If animal fur can trap and hold spilled oil , why ca n't human hair ? '' \nPrisoners in Manila bagged up their hair for a 2006 oil spill So he staged a home oil spill to test this theory , pouring a gallon of used motor oil into his son 's paddling pool . \nHe then dunked in a pair of his wife 's pantyhose stuffed with clippings from his salon . \nWithin two minutes , the DIY boom had sucked up all the oil . \nHe then parlayed this brainwave into a business making oil spill mats from hair purchased in China . \nFor the past 10 years , his company has worked with the Matter of Trust charity to establish a hair recycling system to find a use for the all the hair and fur cut off by stylists and pet groomers each day . \nThe charity 's figures suggest this amounts to 370,000 pounds of hair , and 300,000 pounds of fur , a day in the US alone . \nWhile fur , horse hair and feathers are also used in the booms , the charity says human hair seems to be most effective as it has less natural oil and so more capacity to catch spilled oil . \nA regular part of the BBC News Magazine , Who , What , Why ? \naims to answer some of the questions behind the headlines To make a hair boom , first cut the legs off a pair of tights , and fit the open end over a wide plastic pipe - this makes it easier to feed the hair and fur into the stocking . \nOnce it 's full , tie off the end and cover the resulting sausage in a strong mesh . \nWhile the charity welcomes all donations , there are a few caveats - it prefers freshly-washed hair and fur , and hair to be from the head only . \nThis is because each boom is hand-made , and its volunteers are unlikely to want to handle filthy - or intimate - off-cuts . \nBut what happens to all the oil-soaked hair ? \nAmong the options tried by the charity include feeding the whole mess to worms to break down into fertiliser . \n"}
{"id": "1338", "time": "2010-06-09", "text": "Thousands have submitted their ideas to BP We asked readers to submit their ideas on how the Gulf of Mexico oil spill should have been stopped . \nA selection of the hundreds we received has been assessed by Prof Iraj Ershaghi , director of petroleum engineering at the University of Southern California . \nBP 's cap on the well is currently , according to the company 's estimates , capturing more than half of the oil . \nBut could there be a better way ? \n`` Drill a hole next to the well . \nPlace a low-yield nuclear warhead and detonate it . \n`` The power will fuse the rock together and the intense pressure from the sea water will keep the rock in place thus sealing the leak . '' \n- Michael Murray , Greensboro , North Carolina , US Prof Ershaghi says : `` A nuclear blast would not fuse the pipe under the cooling effect of water but rather would create a crater and would make it impossible to control the flow . '' \n`` I think you should create a large fabric tube to help control the amount of oil that gets away from the leak . \nI think something like parachute cloth might work because that fabric is quite a tight weave - water passes through , but I do n't think oil would . \n`` It might have access panels , especially near the bottom where the actual leaks are occurring , but perhaps that would allow for some kind of pump to pump the oily water that would be held within the tube . '' \n- Elaine Seniuk , Enfield , Canada Prof Ershaghi says : `` What forces the oil and water to flow through the fabric is a pressure of close to 7,000 pounds per square inch . \nWe also need to realize the volume being produced -LRB- 15,000-20 ,000 barrels per day or 600,000 to 800,000 gallons a day -RRB- . \nThat means capacity requirements that are impossible to create or install under 5,000 ft of water . '' \n`` How about using small polystyrene beads impregnated with iron filings to cling to the oil , then pick up the beads with an electromagnet which could be mounted on any number of platforms such as vehicles or boats . \nSinking oil harder to collect `` Beads get processed to remove the oil , then re-used . \nCheap to produce , easy to collect from water , better than trying to scrape oil off difficult surfaces . \nBeads would be easily deployable by air\\/sea . '' \n- Alwyn Turner , Chapel-en-le-Frith , UK Prof Ershaghi says : `` They use straw to help in collecting oil . \nAny other type of material attachment could result in making the oil drops heavier . \nCausing the oil droplets to sink will not solve the spill clean-up as we will be polluting the water below the surface . \nPlease also realize , mass production of any new products on the scale of sinking miles of spilled oil on the surface requires months if not years of planning and manufacturing . '' \n`` How do we block any hole in the earth ? \nBy using the natural resources of the earth itself . \nI suggest that BP utilise barge after barge of rocks that will sink quickly and directly over the outpouring . \n`` Enough rocks to create a mini-mountain . \nSea bed sand might eventually fill the gaps in the rocks as a kind of cement . '' \n- Vernon Turner , St Ives , Cambridgeshire , UK Prof Ershaghi says : `` If BP had cut the riser during the first week and had installed a second blowout preventer , a massively heavy 48ft stack , it would have done the equivalent of what you are suggesting . \nBy dropping large pieces of rock , there is no way they can seal all the holes in between the boulders to stop the flow . \nUse of soft sand will not work for sealing the holes as the flow of high pressure oil and gas will blow away sediment and rocks . '' \n`` Wrap electromagnets at different sections of the pipe and secure . \nInject small metal material into pipe to be attracted to magnets . \nAs material adheres to inside of pipe , inject slightly larger material . \nMake sure electromagnets are powerful enough . \nLike ` top kill ' and would n't work `` Eventually , the flow will decrease and perhaps stop just like a clogged artery in the human body . \nRemember , power to the magnets must not stop until the pipe is safely capped . '' \n- Anon Prof Ershaghi says : `` BP was trying to inject high pressure mud and could not fight the upward flow of oil and gas . \nIt is hard to inject the materials you are suggesting with fluid unless they are pulverized . \nIf they could have been injected , they would have been subjected to the upward pressure and could not have entered the casing . '' \n`` I think that the hole could be plugged to greatly reduce the flow , if not end it , by sinking an old ship over the leak . \nA ship might not create a seal `` If extra ballast were added to the ship to make it even heavier , it would exert enough pressure to seal the hole . '' \n- Howard H Rothman , Bridgeport , Connecticut , US Prof Ershaghi says : `` If we used your idea , the weight of the sunken vessel must be enough to overcome the upward force of the fluid while also a tight seal is required over the casing . \nA better idea is still , as mentioned above , placing another blowout preventer after cutting the riser . '' \n`` What will contain it is simply an enormous funnel in thin mild steel which can be lowered over the whole mess with enough pipe of suitably flexible material and diameter to guide the oil to the surface , where of course it will need a constant supply of tankers to suck\\/pump it safely aboard . \nThe current cap is better `` Obviously the flow-rate and rate of rise needs to be well estimated to get the diameter of the mile of pipe to the surface . '' \n- G Vert Vaughan , Veliko Tarnovo , Bulgaria Prof Ershaghi says : `` What BP has done in terms of connecting the Lower Marine Riser Package -LRB- the cap on top of the blowout preventer -RRB- to take the oil to the surface is similar to your idea , except , they did not have to make a huge funnel to accommodate 800,000 gallons of oil per day . '' \n`` Manufacture a series of 30cm custom plugs , each tapered at the front like a bullet . \nEach plug must have the same diameter as the inner diameter of the tube -LRB- minus 2mm to prevent jamming on the way in -RRB- . \nHowever , along the sides of the plugs , cut 100 small diagonal incisions . \nThus the plug will look like it is barbed . \nDamaging the well casing would be catastrophic `` It will go in easily , but dig itself in when going out , plus the more pressure exerted by the gas , the deeper the plug will dig into the pipe sides . \nClearly , the plug must be made of a metal harder than the pipe , or it wo n't be able to do this . \nUse a pneumatic or even limited explosive charge to deliver the plugs . \nI suggest a minimum of two - that 's how we seal basement leaks in Canada , after all . '' \n- Dave Lundy , Canada Prof Ershaghi says : `` Maintaining the integrity of the casing is extremely critical . \nUse of any hard materials or force against the casing is counter-productive as bursting of the casing could occur . \nThat would make it impossible to control the flow . '' \n`` The most obvious solution to me is to use a bladder that is inserted deep into the pipeline , then pumped up with a high pressure medium . \nOnce the flow has stopped and the feed line removed , the end of the pipe may be sealed by whatever caps are required . \nCoiled tubing might have been an option `` Alternatively , once the pipe is repaired and if it is to be used again the bladder may be deflated . '' \n- Mike Konshak , Louisville , Colorado , US Prof Ershaghi says : `` BP could not have done anything of this sort until they cut the riser . \nOne practical solution similar to yours is the use of industry standard coiled tubing . \nYes , they could have done that to pump high pressure fluid to fight the well pressure . \nBut one has to be careful not to burst the casing . '' \n`` Being an ex-plumber , the only way to deal with a pressurized leak is to keep the open end and connect a fitting to the pipe , then shut the fitting when the pipe connection is made . \nUnderwater and at 5,000 ft , you would need to use a skirt , fixed to an open-ended pipe . \nThe skirt could be split on one side . \nThis could be drawn down over the broken pipe end and fixed to a sound portion of the broken pipe , away from the break . \nSimilar to using a second blowout preventer `` This could be fixed in place using traditional mechanical fittings , but it is not taking the strain yet , as the pressurized stream is going up the new open pipe and through the split skirt . \nThen you can slowly draw the skirt closed , re-strengthening the fixings on the sound part of the broken pipe , thus allowing the skirt to take more strain of the pressurized flow . \nThe skirt can be drawn to a close , as the fixings are made good behind it and the pressurized stream will flow up the new pipe to awaiting vessels . '' \n- Paul , Canada Prof Ershaghi says : `` The practical way to use your idea , as discussed above , would have been to actually install another blowout preventer over the existing one after BP managed to cut the riser . \nThey did not do that . \nStill , if the containment device does not stop the flow , they may have to resort to that option . '' \n`` To stop the oil flow in the pipe in the Gulf of Mexico , form a funnel that fits into the open pipe and also grips it below the top outside to keep it stable . \nPour lead balls of the right size into the funnel to definitely sink into the oil flow despite its speed . \nThey need to be as small as possible while being big enough to be sure to sink . \nThey must be less than about a third of the width of the opening in the funnel to avoid self-jamming in the funnel or pipe and not so large that venturi forces around the balls -LRB- from increased oil flow speeds passing the balls -RRB- stop them from sinking . \nLike the failed ` junk shot ' `` Reduce the size of the lead balls as the reduced oil flow speed allows smaller ones to sink . \nWhen enough lead balls have been fed in to slow down the oil speed , start putting clay balls into the oil pipe . \nWhen enough of them have been fed in , put in more lead balls -LRB- or steel balls would do by this stage -RRB- . \nThese last balls will , under the action of gravity , then deform the clay balls to form a seal in the pipe . '' \n- Peter Keogh , Olso , Norway Prof Ershaghi says : `` Your idea falls in the category of the junk shot that BP found was not successful . '' \n`` Could the pipe be crimped shut ? \nI have read that ` giant shears ' were used to cut the pipe , so why not ` giant pliers ' ? \nSince capping and siphoning seem problematic , crimping , even if not complete and permanent , should diminish the flow at least partially and until the relief wells or other means can ameliorate the situation . \nSimilar to what blowout preventer should have done `` Once crimping was used it would deform the pipe so that capping or siphoning would be almost impossible . '' \n- Julian P Crane , Everett , Massachusetts , US Prof Ershaghi says : `` Yes , if the blind ram - a device that forms a seal - had worked on the blowout preventer , that was exactly the way the seal process would have taken place to close the casing . '' \n`` Epoxy might be a better top kill method than mud , and in any case a heavier solid is needed - try bismuth and\\/or iron shot . \nDelivering the resin and catalyst into the well requires two tubes , though an intermediate pulse of isopropyl alcohol may have a chance or separating the two liquids in a single feed tube , there 'd be a risk of simply clogging the feed tube before it reached the well . \nFiring a warhead into the well not wise `` Another alternative plug is a torpedo , wire-guided , with a low speed mode -LRB- or restrictor -RRB- for manoeuvring into place , and an extended warhead holding just enough charge to split containers of epoxy monomer and catalyst . '' \n- Jeremy , New Jersey , US Prof Ershaghi says : `` A torpedo or any warhead entering the casing would have made this a major catastrophe as the loss of casing integrity would have resulted in a crater with continuous and uncontrollable oil flow for the next 30-40 years depending on the amount of oil in the reservoir . '' \n`` Use an umbrella plug , which would be deployed into the well to the point where the drill borehole breached the well , effectively capping from the inside . \nUmbrella could not withstand pressure `` You could let the pressure of the well secure the plug or fix it to the seabed . '' \n- Shayne Dawe , Plymouth , UK Prof Ershaghi says : `` Umbrella type materials that can collapse to fit the pipe and then expand under pressure can not withstand 6,000-7 ,000 pounds per square inch of pressure . '' \n`` They should drill another hole into the same well and continue collecting the oil . \nThis would diminish the pressure in the currently leaking system , and make it possible to seal the leak . \nRelief well must go in at an angle `` If it is possible to hit the current well by drilling into it at an angle , this ` shallow ' drill may be faster and easier to do than going all the depth into the reservoir . '' \n- Alex , Boston , Massachusetts , US Prof Ershaghi says : `` At the site there are a lot of vessels , the relief well needs to be away from them . \nYou have to go down and then angle it , when you dig the relief well . '' \n`` It appears that below the cut that they have made before capping the pipe , there is a section of the pipe that is bolted , which combines the two sections of pipe . \nWould n't it be possible to remove the bolts and attach a new section of pipe , bolting the new piece on incrementally , which would allow some leverage in allowing for a rotation of the new section into place . \nNecessary torque difficult under water `` The new section could have a valve that could be closed off once this section is put into place , thereby minimizing the pressure that they would face when installing this new section . '' \n- John Allison , Doylestown , Pennsylvania , US Prof Ershaghi says : `` Such operations would require a tremendous amount of torque and this is very difficult with robots and underwater . '' \n`` To clean up the spill itself they could use a hydrocarbon polymer which attaches itself to oil and produces a sponge-like material which would be easier to clean up , or scoop up . \nThese polymers are used , but sheer volume problematic `` They could even dye the polymer so that the resultant material is much more visible and again easier to collect . '' \n- Steve , Bermuda Prof Ershaghi says : `` Materials similar to what you are proposing are used , but the sheer magnitude of the amounts needed to treat the volume of oil and the timely spread and collection in a speedy manner is not easily manageable . '' \n`` I know that a lot of wells in the Gulf of Mexico are difficult to produce because of hydrate -LRB- methane ice -RRB- formation . \nThe containment dome failed because of this . \nHas the idea of promoting the formation of hydrates within the wellbore itself , to form an ice plug to stop the flow of hydrocarbons , been considered ? \nFreezing would not reliably block the well `` With a reservoir that does not have free water , and producing at above hydrate curve temperatures , the hydrates will not form until the gas has expanded and cooled the surrounding area -LRB- Joule Thompson effect -RRB- . \nHowever , if ice cold , fresh water were pumped into the wellbore , perhaps with some ice crystals or grains of sand , or something to promote the seed required to help the hydrate cage form , that may promote the formation of a hydrate plug within the wellbore itself . '' \n- Mike , Stony Plain , Alberta , Canada Prof Ershaghi says : `` You are correct . \nIn fact , hydrate can form near the mud line close to the sea bed . \nEven if some restrictions develop , this is not a reliable way to stop the flow . \nA simple change of thermodynamics can change the conditions .

came a day after he announced plans to bolster safety requirements for shallow-water oil drilling . \nHe said that drilling would continue , but it `` has to be done in a safe way '' . \nMr Salazar said the pause , which was put in place following the 20 April explosion of the Deepwater Horizon rig , would remain `` until we can have a sense of safety , until we have a sense that this can never happen again '' . \nMr Salazar also told the panel he would ask BP to repay the salaries of any workers laid off due to the six-month moratorium . \nThree committees and two subcommittees on Capitol Hill were to discuss matters related to the oil spill and oil industry on Wednesday . \nAmong the new safety regulations announced by Mr Salazar on Tuesday , oil companies drilling in US waters will now have to inspect their blow-out preventers and provide safely certificates . \nThe BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill is having a devastating impact on the environment and the economy of the Gulf Coast states and their communities '' End Quote Adm Thad Allen US Coast Guard The failure of the blow-out preventer on the Deepwater Horizon rig led to the oil spill , the worst in US history . \nA containment cap placed on the blown-out well last week is now helping to contain some of the leaking oil . \nAdm Allen said in a press conference on Wednesday that the containment operation was now catching up to 630,000 gallons -LRB- 2,864,037 litres -RRB- daily . \nHe said he hoped the existing containment structure would soon be able to hold 1.17 million gallons per day . \n`` We 're only at 15 -LRB- 15,000 barrels -RRB- now and we 'll be at 28 -LRB- 28,000 barrels -RRB- next week . \nWe 're building capacity , '' said Adm Allen . \nAt some point there might `` have to be a transition between a containment cap and a regular cap '' , he said . \nAdm Allen added that Obama administration officials were talking to BP about a longer-term containment strategy with `` built-in redundancies '' . \nThe government has estimated that 600,000 to 1.2 million gallons a day are leaking from the bottom of the sea . \nBP 's efforts to tackle the spill have come under close scrutiny BP has said it will donate net revenues from the oil recovered to a fund to restore wildlife habitats on the coastlines of four affected Gulf Coast states . \nHowever , a BP spokesman told the AP news agency that it could not say how much of the recovered oil had been processed . \nAdm Thad Allen wrote to BP on Tuesday demanding `` more detail and openness '' about how the company is managing claims for compensation payments to individuals and businesses in the region . \n`` The BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill is having a devastating impact on the environment and the economy of the Gulf Coast states and their communities , '' he wrote . \nMeanwhile , tests have shown that underwater oil plumes have traveled at least 64km -LRB- 40 miles -RRB- from the leaking well , the US government says . \nScientists noted that concentrations of oil in the plumes were `` very low '' , but said the plumes were very difficult to clean up , and they could damage the Gulf 's abundant sea life by depleting oxygen in the water . \nSpeaking on US network NBC 's Today show on Wednesday , BP spokesman Doug Suttles maintained BP 's position that no massive underwater oil plumes in `` large concentrations '' had been detected . \n`` It may be down to how you define what a plume is here , '' he said . \nOil has been leaking into the Gulf of Mexico since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded and sank off the coast of the US state of Louisiana , killing 11 workers . \nThe morning the rig exploded , a BP executive and an official from Transocean , which operated the rig , argued over how to proceed with the drilling , survivors of the blast told CNN . \nThe workers said BP had routinely cut corners and pushed ahead despite concerns about safety . \nA BP spokesman said it would not comment on specific allegations until an investigation into the accident was completed , but said that `` BP 's priority is always safety '' . \nBP chief Tony Hayward is scheduled to appear before Congress next week . \nBP shares fell 3.4 % on Wednesday over worries that the company will have to suspend its dividend payments to pay for legal claims and cleaning up the spill . \nAttempt to cap oil leak The latest stage in BP 's efforts to contain leaking oil has involved lowering a cap onto the failed blowout preventer -LRB- BOP -RRB- valve system on the seabed . \nThe cap sits on the BOP 's lower marine riser package -LRB- LMRP -RRB- section . \nFirst , the damaged riser - the pipe which takes oil from the well - was cut where it nears the seabed using a remotely-operated shear . \nThis was completed at 1930 CDT on 1 June -LRB- 0030 GMT 2 June -RRB- . \nThe next stage was for a diamond wire cutter to saw through the riser close to the LMRP . \nThe blade got stuck and had to be removed but BP eventually cut through the pipe using giant shears manipulated by undersea robots -LRB- ROV -RRB- . \nAfter removing the pipe , the cap was lowered onto the LMRP enabling the leaking oil and gas to be funnelled to a drill ship on the surface . \nLatest estimates suggest more than half of the leaking oil is now being captured . \nBACK -LCB- current -RCB- of -LCB- total -RCB- NEXT

{"id": "109", "time": "2010-06-09", "text": "By Richard Anderson Business reporter , BBC News BP has suffered a number of controversies in recent years It 's not often that a US president has cause to declare that , given the chance , he would sack the boss of one of the UK 's leading companies . \nBut that is precisely what Barack Obama said he would do on Tuesday , prompted by what he considers to be a series of misjudged comments by BP 's chief executive Tony Hayward following the company 's massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . \nAnd it 's a view shared by many critics , some of whom are BP shareholders , unimpressed by Mr Hayward declaring that he `` just wants his life back '' and that the Gulf is a `` big ocean '' . \nSuch comments have simply served to damage further BP 's already battered reputation in the US and fuel anti-BP anger among many Americans , particularly those directly affected by the spill in Louisiana and beyond . \nTo accusations of negligence and incompetence can now be added charges of indifference in the minds of those incensed by the scale of the spill and the time it has taken for BP to stem the flow of oil . \nBut Mr Hayward 's comments are merely an unfortunate aside to the crisis that engulfs one of the world 's leading oil and gas companies . \nTony Hayward 's handling of the disaster has been under scrutiny Shares in BP have slumped almost 40 % since the Deep Horizon oil rig exploded on 20 April , while the clean-up operation has so far cost the company $ 1.25 bn -LRB- # 862m -RRB- . \nA high cost certainly , but considering the company made a profit of $ 14bn last year , down from $ 25bn in 2008 , one that BP can afford to pay . \nThe 2009 profit was generated from revenues of $ 239bn and , even after its recent share price slump , BP 's market capitalization stands at $ 107bn . \nThe fact that it reports its profit figures in dollars should come as no surprise , for despite its name , BP is very much a global company . \nIt began life as the Anglo Persian Oil Company in 1909 , before becoming British Petroleum in 1954 . \nIn 2000 , it joined with Arco , the US petrol giant , and two years later acquired the German fuel group Aral and lubricant specialist Castrol . \nToday , the BP brand also encompasses the US convenience store group Ampm and the Wild Bean Cafe chain in the UK . \nIt operates in 80 countries across the world and sells its products and services in more than 100 . \nIt employs more than 80,000 people and runs 22,400 petrol stations globally . \nNor is the ownership of BP strictly British . \nThe company is 44 % - owned in the UK , split largely between 33 institutions and seven large individual investors . \nBut , since it is one of the UK 's biggest companies and a major constituent of the FTSE 100 index , many thousands of UK private investors will have exposure to BP though tracker funds and pensions . \nUS investors own 39 % of the company , including 25 institutional and 14 big individual investors . \nDespite its success , size and profitability , BP is no stranger to controversy . \nThe Deep Horizon spill is certainly a massive challenge to the company , both financially and in terms of public relations , but it is not the first time BP has been in the international spotlight . \nIn 2006 , a US congressional hearing accused BP of `` unacceptable '' neglect of pipelines in Alaska after it was forced to shut down oil operations in Prudhoe Bay because of leaking pipes . \nIn 2007 , the company was fined a total of $ 373m by the US Department of Justice for environmental crimes and committing fraud . \nThe fine included $ 50m relating to a Texas refinery explosion in 2005 that killed 15 people and injured 170 more . \nThe largest single fine of $ 303m related to a price manipulation scam in the propane market . \nLast October , BP was fined a further $ 87m for failing to correct safety hazards at the Texas refinery . \nThe company has also faced harsh criticism , from shareholders and environmental campaigners , about its plans to develop oil sands in Canada . \nThe methods used to extract oil from these sands give rise to far more carbon emissions than even standard oil drilling , they argue . \nTo some in the US , therefore , the Deep Horizon spill feels all too much like a terrible deja vu . \nIndeed , given its chequered recent history and experience of controversy , perhaps the most surprising thing about the Gulf oil spill is just how badly BP has handled the publicity surrounding it . \nThe pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ? \n"}

{"id": "2103", "time": "2010-06-07", "text": "By Damian Kahya Business reporter , BBC News Is investing in oil firms no longer such a good idea ? \nWe might not think of ourselves as shareholders in a big oil company , but many of us are . \nIf you hold an occupational pension you probably own shares in BP . \nInvestors will have watched last week 's news that the company is to delay a decision on its next dividend payment with concern . \nBP accounts for about 8 % of all the income going into the UK 's pension funds . \nBut just as the financial crash raised concerns over banking stocks , BP 's Gulf of Mexico spill is leading some to worry about the risks of owning shares in oil companies . \nLeading economist Lord Stern recently suggested environmental risks including climate change should be factored into long-term investment decisions . \n`` Investing long-term in ` dirty ' technologies is actually risking their clients money , '' he said referring to pension funds . \nBut is there an alternative ? \nMost British pensions are partly invested in shares linked to the list of the country 's biggest firms , the FTSE 100 . \nIt comes down to whether BP are doing the right and responsible thing when they are trying to improve safety and so on '' End Quote Adrian Lowcock Investment advisor , Best Invest BP is one of the largest on the list . \nBefore the oil spill it accounted for around 9 % of the FTSE 100 's value . \nIt is also one of relatively few stocks to pay a high dividend . \nBut as new oil gets harder to find , international firms are trying to find it in ever more hazardous locations - a mile under the sea , the Arctic and tar sands . \n`` Oil companies are increasingly being forced into these extreme frontier environments where the inherent risk is going up and up , '' says Seb Beloe , head of socially responsible investing at fund management firm , Henderson Global Investors . \n`` Maybe this will prove to be an isolated example , but I would n't be surprised if it was n't . '' \nMany pension funds do now take into account social , political and environmental risks . \nSome ethical investment funds do n't buy shares in tobacco companies But avoiding such stocks entirely is difficult . \nOther big players on the FTSE include fellow oil company Shell , mining giant Rio Tinto , cigarette firm British American Tobacco and defense contractor BAE systems . \nLeaving out shares in such firms could leave a portfolio unbalanced , and so vulnerable to problems in a particular industry , such as banking . \nInstead some pension trustees focus on pushing for companies they own to reform practices . \n`` It comes down to whether BP are doing the right and responsible thing when they are trying to improve safety and so on , '' says Adrian Lowcock an investment advisor from Best Invest . \nEven companies critical of BP , such as the Co-operative Group , own shares in the firm for their employee pension scheme . \n`` We engage with management on performance on environmental and social issues , '' says Mike Fox its head of UK equities . \nThere are some private income funds which avoid BP - available to a small number of people . \nHendersons has a fund which sold out of the stock after BP 's last safety incident in 2003 . \nSince the incident it had out-performed the FTSE by more than 2 % - most of that down to not owning plummeting BP shares . \nBut even that fund owns shares in a gas firm . \n`` If you want a dividend and you do n't want to be in oil and gas I do n't know if there is a fund that can meet those criteria , '' says Mr Beloe . \nThe situation is different when it comes to investments - such as a share ISA . \nBP boss Tony Hayward has delayed a decision on the dividend Here a range of products offer `` sustainable '' or `` ethical '' ways to invest . \nThere is considerable choice as to what areas you may want to focus on or avoid , from animal testing , to climate change , to encouraging renewable energy . \nBut these investments carry their own risks . \n`` Funds that choose not to invest in certain markets will always carry some volatility , '' says Mr Fox from the Co-op . \nTo begin with they sometimes exclude many of the companies which do relatively well during a recession . \n`` Ethical funds suffer from a lack of diversification , '' says Mr Lowcock . \n`` Defensive companies which are protected from downsides in the market such as alcohol or gambling may not be included . '' \nDuring the credit crunch some `` ethical '' investments which avoided oil and mining shares instead held shares in banks and small companies - two big losers . \nIndividual funds vary , but figures from the Investment Management Association -LRB- IMA -RRB- show # 1000 invested in an ethically filtered group of UK companies earned marginally less over the last one , three , five and 10 years than those in a generic basket . \nThe reverse was true for international investments . \nThe recovery has also been led by commodity companies - such as BP . \n`` That presents a real challenge , '' says Mr Fox . \n`` And we 've not been exposed to that , so the sustainable market has not been the best-performing . '' \nCurrently # 5.9 bn is invested in ethical funds - an all-time record . \nBut new sales have not been increasing . \nGross sales figures from the IMA showed ethical funds accounted for 1.3 % of gross sales in 2007 . \nThat figure had almost halved by the first quarter of 2010 . \nMany believe the economic recovery and BP oil spill could see a change in this pattern . \nBP 's shares lost a third of their value after the spill - nothing comparable happened after the Exxon Valdez disaster in 1989 . \n`` Things like socially responsible investment and corporate responsibility move in jumps due to shocks to the system , '' says James Marriot from Platform , an NGO critical of the oil and gas industry . \nHe calls stocks such as BP and Shell `` national treasures '' , held by investors because of their reputation for reliable high returns . \nSome , such as Lord Stern , are now arguing these should be seen as rather more risky investments than they were before . \nThe pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ? \n"}

'' \nHomeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano also appeared at Monday 's hearing , the first time senators were able to question officials about the response to the 20 April disaster . \nTarballs of oil are said to be more manageable She said the government was monitoring the loop current very closely and treating it as if it were a coastline . \n`` In other words ... if we were to see that the oil really was beginning to move toward the loop current we would begin doing some things in the way of dispersant and booming ... as if the loop current itself were a piece of the coast , '' she said . \nSenator Joseph Lieberman , who chairs the committee , said at the hearing that the government should not allow any new deep water wells to get permits or be drilled until the industry could prove it could prevent another failure of drilling equipment in deep waters or contain oil spills more effectively . \nBP America 's president , Lamar McKay , returned to the Senate for the hearing , having already faced questions along with other oil industry executives last week . \nI think we ought to be cautious in terms of defining what plumes are out there and how they 're behaving Scientists said on Sunday they had found vast underwater plumes of oil , one 10 miles long and a mile wide , lending weight to the fears of those who believe the actual spill could be many times greater than the estimate of 5,000 barrels daily . \nBut Mr McKay told senators : `` I think we ought to be cautious in terms of defining what plumes are out there and how they 're behaving . '' \nThe US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration cast doubt on the plume reports , saying no definitive conclusions had been reached because the findings were unverified . \nBP also said on Monday it had received 15,000 claims for compensation , and had already paid out on 2,500 claims . \nExperts warn that BP 's total liability for the spill could run into billions of dollars . \n"}

'' \nUS President Barack Obama had earlier called the incident the worst oil spillage disaster in US history . \nHe also said his administration would prosecute over the oil spill if laws have been broken , and promised to change the law if necessary to prevent another such disaster . \nThe nearly $ 1bn clean-up cost to date includes $ 40m in economic injury claims , as well as grants to the authorities in the US states located in the Gulf area . \nHowever , the latest fall in BP 's shares suggests that markets now expect the ultimate cost to the company from the oil spill to be much more severe than this . \nBP 's share price closed on Friday at # 4.95 , but fell to # 4.12 after the markets reopened on Tuesday - after a Monday bank holiday - before closing at # 4.30 . \nBP 's legal liability in the US is currently limited by law to a mere $ 75m , although this is expected to be increased to $ 10bn . \nOil booms - partly successful Dispersant used - scientists warn it may kill marine life Huge dome placed over leak - became blocked by ice crystals Mile-long tube - fails to suck up large amount of oil `` Top-kill '' method to pump heavy mud - abandoned `` The markets are pricing in an apocalyptic scenario , '' said Evgeny Solovyov , equity analyst at SG Securities in London . \nHe added that BP owns only 65 % of the oil well , meaning its legal liability will be limited to just $ 6.5 bn - although it could go higher if BP were found guilty of gross negligence or a criminal act . \n`` The markets seem to assume that BP will have to withdraw from America , '' he added , noting that there was talk among government lawyers about barring the oil company from US government contracts . \nBP is also the biggest participant in deep sea drilling in the Gulf of Mexico , and therefore is likely to be hardest hit by the moratorium on this activity announced by President Barack Obama . \nThe sharp fall in BP 's share price is bad news for UK pension funds , which are major shareholders in the firm . \nThe oil company has claimed that it pays # 1 in every # 7 of dividends that the pension funds receive from FTSE 100 companies . \nAlthough the price change does not directly affect BP 's ability to pay dividends , it does indicate that markets are anticipating a significant cut . \nSome oil analysts have also speculated that if BP 's share price continues to fall , the company may find that it becomes an affordable takeover target for some of its global rivals . \nBP now hopes to cap the leak by using undersea robots to slice through the damaged pipe to make a clean cut that can be connected to another pipe , capturing the leaking oil . \nHowever , this strategy may not stop the oil spill completely . \nThat will only happen once BP has finished drilling two new relief wells - something that is not expected to be ready before August . \nThe White House said the president had been informed that the flow rate could increase by as much as 20 % until the containment device was applied over the leak . \nUniversity of Alabama engineering professor Philip W Johnson told Associated Press news agency that although he was hopeful the plan would succeed , if the new cap could not be placed on the fresh cut , `` things will get much worse '' . \nThe system is similar to a previous containment dome plan that failed . \nMeanwhile , the oil giant said it was stepping up its containment strategy . \nIt said that the total length of the boom - used to collect oil floating on the sea surface - would be almost doubled to 3.7 million ft. . \nBP also now plans to use hoses and other equipment deployed in the failed `` top kill '' strategy to siphon off more of the leaking oil . \n`` BP 's priority is to keep as much oil as we can from causing additional harm to the Gulf , the shoreline and the people of the region , '' said BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward on Monday . \n`` This planned multi-step containment strategy is our best option for achieving this as we work hard towards completing the relief wells that will kill this well completely .

'' \nThat influence has led US politicians to look not only at the performance of companies like BP in the rich oilfields beyond America 's continental shelf , but to the performance of the federal agency which should have been keeping a close eye on the risky business of deep water oil exploration . \nYou do n't hear the mantra of ` drill , baby , drill ' right now as much as you did a month ago in congress To gain permission to drill anywhere in the Gulf of Mexico , BP has to submit a document called an oil spill response plan . \nIn its plan for Deepwater Horizon , BP claimed that in the unlikely event of a spill , it could cope with a worst-case scenario around 30 times bigger than the spill it is currently grappling with . \nThe federal regulator , the Minerals Management Service -LRB- MMS -RRB- , also decided to exempt BP from supplying an environmental assessment of Deepwater Horizon 's impact on the Gulf of Mexico , because it decided a spill would be small and unlikely to reach shore . \nKieran Suckling , director of the American environmental NGO , the Center for Biological Diversity , believes closer oversight by the MMS could have prevented the spill . \n`` The environmental documents would no longer be written by BP and the oil industry , they would have been written by government scientists , giving us an independent assessment of what was happening out there , '' he said . \n`` They could have required more safety equipment , required a better clean-up plan , a very large bond or they could have rejected the permit altogether and said ` no , we 're not going to issue this permit , this project is just too dangerous ' . '' \nUS President Barack Obama has already promised an end to what he calls the ` cosy relationship ' between the MMS and the oil industry . \nBut where does that leave BP , a company which was not so long ago reckoned to hold one in every six pounds invested by UK pension funds ? \n`` It will dent their reputation , it will give them a black eye , '' said Fadel Gheit , an oil analyst from the US investment bank Oppenheimer and Co. . \nIt 's unfortunate that right now there are people who have always been against domestic US exploration that are trying to take advantage of this situation `` Will they recover from it ? \nDepending on how severe this hit is going to be financially and on their reputation , they will recover . \n`` It 's a strong company with lots of resources and a lot of history and a good management team , '' he added . \n`` It will take time , will cost a lot of money and life will go on . '' \nHowever , that assessment is based on the well being shut off soon . \nAnd whatever the result of that operation , Gheit is sure that what will follow is a wave of regulation which the US oil lobby has fought long and hard to avoid . \nFor those on Capitol Hill who would like to see an America less dependent on oil , Deepwater Horizon could be a turning point . \n`` You do n't hear the mantra of ` drill , baby , drill ' right now as much as you did a month ago in Congress , '' said Democratic Representative Raul Grijalva . \n`` This could put more emphasis on alternatives and counter the economic argument by saying there is a cost if we do n't do this right , and the cost is ... borne by the US taxpayer , '' he argued . \nBut the oil industry still has friends on Capitol Hill who think responsibility for Deepwater Horizon lies not with the industry as a whole , but with BP and the federal government . \n`` We 've got experience from 30 years of drilling in the Gulf of Mexico that those safety mechanisms work when they 're used properly . \nWhat happened in this explosion is something that should not have happened , '' said Republican Representative Steve Scalise , whose Louisiana district is on the Gulf of Mexico . \n`` It 's unfortunate that right now there are people who have always been against domestic US exploration that are trying to take advantage of this situation , and to use it as an opportunity to say , ' I told you so , we should n't drill in the United States . ' \n`` That would be like raising the white flag because ultimately that would make the US even more dependent on the Middle East for oil . \n`` We have got to do is say ` we 're not going to tolerate this kind of failure of safety standards ' . \nWe 've got to hold every company , including BP to that standard .

'' \nHe added : `` It 's clear that this will be a transforming event in the history of deep water exploration . '' \nQuestions were raised in the memo as to whether proper procedures were followed in carrying out pressure testing and other activities in the 24 hours before the explosion . \nA worker for Transocean , the Deepwater Horizon rig 's owner , told US Coast Guard investigators he had heard senior managers complaining that BP was `` taking shortcuts '' by using seawater instead of drilling mud in the well before the blowout , according to witness statements seen by the Associated Press news agency . \nBP is under intense pressure to succeed with its latest attempt to stem the leak , after previous measures failed . \n`` I have to say that it will be a day or two before we can have certainty that it 's worked , '' Mr Hayward told the US network NBC 's Today show . \nIf pressure and density sufficient , oil and gas flow stops Coast Guard Adm Mary Landry said federal authorities had approved the `` top kill '' measure - the final authorisation needed for BP to decide whether to go ahead . \nSpeaking on a visit to California , President Barack Obama said : `` If it 's successful , and there 's no guarantee , it should greatly reduce or eliminate the flow of oil now streaming into the Gulf from the sea floor . '' \nHe said the `` heartbreaking '' spill highlighted the need to find alternative energy sources . \n`` We will not rest until this well is shut , the environment is repaired and the clean-up is complete , '' he added . \nIf the new procedure is used , heavy drilling fluids - such as mud - will be injected into the well about a mile -LRB- 1.5 km -RRB- underwater . \nEngineers hope to follow this with cement , designed to seal the well . \nThe company has said it estimates a 60-70 % chance of success . \nOfficials say the method has been used before in other areas of the world , but not at the depths required to stem the oil from the Deepwater rig . \nIf the operation goes ahead , it can be watched via a live video stream of the site , which currently shows plumes of oil and gas escaping from the well . \nA conservative estimate of the amount of oil escaping is about 5,000 barrels -LRB- 210,000 gallons , 795,000 litres -RRB- a day , while some scientists say it could be many times greater . \nThe US government has declared a `` fishery disaster '' in the seafood-producing states of Louisiana , Mississippi and Alabama . \nUltra-deepwater rigs and other equipment are at the site A massive containment and clean-up operation is under way , as the oil reaches the beaches and vulnerable marshlands of a 150-mile stretch of coast . \nSome workers involved in the operation are complaining of health problems after contact with oil and chemical dispersants , the Los Angeles Times reports . \nThe fishermen , who say they are suffering from nausea , dizziness and breathing problems , told the paper they were not issued with special equipment but were simply told by BP not to pick up oil waste . \nLouisiana Congressman Charlie Melancon has urged the federal government to set up mobile clinics in rural area to treat those affected , the paper reports . \nBP has said conditions are being monitored . \nMr Obama is due to make his second visit to the Gulf of Mexico region on Friday . \nHis visit will come a day after he receives a report into offshore drilling that is expected to recommend tougher regulations and demand more safeguards . \nIn the tests which began on Tuesday , five spots on the well 's crippled five-story blowout preventer were being checked to make sure it could withstand the heavy force of the injection . \nA weak spot in the device could blow under the pressure , causing a brand new leak at the site 50 miles -LRB- 80km -RRB- off the Louisiana coast . \nThe pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ? \n"}

'' \nMadeleine Morris BBC News , Pensacola , Florida Pensacola prides itself on its pristine , soft white sand beaches . \nHundreds of thousands of tourists flock here every year to surf , swim and sunbathe . \nBut this year , the area 's coastline is tarnished . \nCountless soft globules of tar - some as small as a coin others as big as a floormat - are washing up on shore . \nThe beaches are still open , but as oil continues to spurt from the broken well 90 miles away , residents know their troubles are just beginning . \nSo far the coastlines most affected have been in Louisiana , Alabama and Mississippi to the west . \nBut as the leak continues , it 's expected to enter a current that will move the oil from the Gulf of Mexico around the Florida peninsula , and onto the east coast of the state . \nAsked what amount of the estimate that represented , the BP chief executive said it was expected to be `` the majority , probably the vast majority '' of the oil gushing out . \n`` We have a further containment system to implement in the course of this coming week which will be in place by next weekend so when those two are in place , we would very much hope to be containing the vast majority of the oil .

'' \nBut the man in charge of the federal efforts to cope with the spill said no-one should be pleased `` as long as there 's oil in the water '' . \nCoast Guard Adm Thad Allen told CNN the spill was `` an insidious enemy that 's attacking our shores '' . \nThe Deepwater Horizon rig sank on 20 April after an explosion , killing 11 workers . \nBoth BP and the US government have been criticised for the response so far . \nThe environmental impact has been described as the worst in US history President Barack Obama has pledged to stand with the residents of Louisiana until they are `` made whole '' . \nMr Obama has said he will ensure that BP is financially accountable for the damaged caused . \nThe containment cap is designed to funnel most of the leaking oil to a boat on the surface . \nIt will be followed by a further containment system that involves using the pipes of a failed , previous operation to divert more oil to another vessel ; and by a separate method - due to be in place by the end of this month - which is expected to be able to operate in hurricane conditions . \nBP is also digging two relief wells which it hopes will provide a permanent solution to the leak - but they are not due to be completed until August . \nThe estimates for the total amount of oil that has leaked since the spill began vary widely from 20 million to 45 million gallons . \nFour states have so far been affected by the spill - Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama and Florida . \nThe oil risks affecting some of the famous white beaches of Florida , whose economy is heavily dependent on tourism . \nOne-third of the Gulf 's federal waters remain closed to fishing , and the spill has killed and injured birds and marine animals . \n`` These waters are my backyard , my life , '' boat captain Dave Marino from Myrtle Grove , Louisiana , told AP news agency . \n`` It 's a nightmare . \nIt looks like it 's going to be wave after wave of it and nobody can stop it .

'' \nThe US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration cast doubt on the plume reports , saying no definitive conclusions had been reached because the findings were unverified . \nBP said earlier on Monday it was managing to funnel the equivalent of 1,000 barrels a day of oil from the blown well to a tanker ship with the use of a mile-long tube . \nThat would amount to a fifth of the estimated daily spill of 5,000 barrels - an estimate made by the Coast Guard and BP . \n`` This is just containing the flow , later this week , hopefully before the end of the week , we 'll make our next attempt to actually fully stop the flow , '' BP Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles told NBC 's Today program . \nBP finally managed to insert the tube into the leaking pipe , using underwater robots , on Sunday at the third attempt . \nBut , in a joint statement , Ms Napolitano and Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar said the latest technique was `` not a solution to the problem and it is not yet clear how successful it may be '' . \nBP also said on Monday it had received 15,000 claims for compensation , and had already paid out on 2,500 claims . \nExperts warn that BP 's total liability for the spill could run into billions of dollars . \n"}

'' \n`` So who is in charge of stopping the oil spill , BP or the federal government ? \nThe fact that the answer to this question seems as murky as the water around the exploded oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico suggests that this is an excellent moment to recognize that our arguments pitting capitalism against socialism and the government against the private sector muddle far more than they clarify . '' \nthat there is a need for a rethink of regulation : `` BP has broken the mould of self-regulation . \nWith all companies now operating in its shadow , we need tougher enforcement of CSR -LRB- corporate social responsibility -RRB- . \nManipulation of objectives by PR departments has to stop . \nCongress should mandate that multinationals incorporated or operating in the US should create professionally staffed divisions to uphold Global Compact principles and core duties set forth in more enlightened codes of conduct . \nIn a move beyond feelgood ethics and anaemic committees , compliance divisions should report directly to chief management and the board of directors , and periodically file public sustainability reports to regulatory bureaux in Washington ramped up for rigorous oversight . \n`` Compliance divisions should act with independent authority -LRB- like police departments ' internal affairs offices -RRB- to enforce CSR and compel planning for worst-case scenarios . \nConventional risk assessment reports focus on what risks might impair investors ' confidence in a company . \nFuture ones should also examine the catastrophic risks that would undermine society 's confidence . '' \nIn the Guardian John Vidal argues that the Gulf disaster is only unusual for being so near the US : `` If this accident had occurred in a developing country , say off the west coast of Africa or Indonesia , BP could probably have avoided all publicity and escaped starting a clean-up for many months . \nIt would not have had to employ booms or dispersants , and it could have ignored the health effects on people and the damage done to fishing . \nIt might have eventually been taken to court and could have been fined a few million dollars , but it would probably have appealed and delayed a court decision for a decade or more . \n`` Big Oil is usually a poor country 's most powerful industry , and is generally allowed to act like a parallel government . \nIn many countries it simply pays off the judges , the community leaders , the lawmakers and the ministers , and it expects environmentalists and local people to be powerless . \nMostly it gets away with it .

'' \nHalliburton later issued a statement saying it believed there were significant differences between its own tests and those performed by the commission . \n`` The commission tested off-the-shelf cement and additives , whereas Halliburton tested the unique blend of cement and additives that existed on the rig at the time Haliburton 's tests were conducted , '' it said . \nThe company also denied any suggestion that it knowingly used a potentially defective product , suggesting that the failed internal tests were invalid because the cement mixture was different from the one eventually used in the well . \nHowever , the last-minute changes demanded by BP meant that the final cement mix was not tested fully , it admitted . \nEarlier statements by the company had said tests had shown the cement to be stable . \nHalliburton also criticised BP for not performing a cement bond log test , which checks the cement is secure after it has been pumped down the well , or properly interpreting the negative-pressure test . \nThe oil spill devastated wildlife along the Gulf Coast `` Given these numerous intervening causes , Halliburton does not believe that the foam cement design used on the Macondo well was the cause of the incident . '' \nThe BBC 's Iain MacKenzie in Washington says the oil spill commission 's findings go some way to supporting BP 's own investigation , which found failings in the composition of the cement . \nHowever , the full report has yet to be published and at this stage the investigators stop short of apportioning blame , our correspondent says . \nMr Bartlit also noted shortcomings by Transocean , which operated the Deepwater Horizon rig on behalf of BP . \n`` Because it may be anticipated that a particular cement job may be faulty , the oil industry has developed tests , such as the negative pressure test and cement evaluation logs , to identify cementing failures . \nIt has also developed methods to remedy deficient cement jobs , '' he wrote . \n`` BP and\\/or Transocean personnel misinterpreted or chose not to conduct such tests at the Macondo well , '' he added . \nBut Mr Bartlit also cautioned in his letter that `` the story of the blowout does not turn solely on the quality of the Macondo cement job '' . \nThe pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ? \n"}

Separately , BP said it could cover the costs of the clean-up and compensation claims without selling new shares , amid rumors that a Middle Eastern sovereign wealth fund was about to buy a stake . \nThe commander of the US Coast Guard in the Galveston region , Capt Marcus Woodring , said about five gallons -LRB- 19 litres -RRB- of tar balls from the Deepwater Horizon leak had been found on Saturday . \nBut he said it was impossible to confirm whether they had drifted from the site of the leak , about 550 miles -LRB- 885km -RRB- away , or had dropped off one of the ships carrying collected oil to Texas to be processed . \nThe joint BP-US government response team said there were doubts that the oil had drifted all the way from the spill . \n`` The testing found that the oil was lightly weathered , raising doubts that the oil traversed the Gulf from the spill source , '' a statement said . \nGalveston 's mayor , Joe Jaworski , said he was hopeful the analysis was correct and that the tar balls were not a sign of more oil to come . \n`` This is good news . \nThe water looks good . \nWe 're cautiously optimistic this is an anomaly , '' he said . \nTexas Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson meanwhile promised in a statement that any of the state 's coastline affected by the spill `` will be cleaned up quickly and BP will be picking up the tab '' . \nThe coasts of four other US Gulf states - Louisiana , Alabama , Mississippi and Florida - have so far been more seriously affected by the spill . \nTar balls and oily water were spotted on Monday near the mouth of Lake Pontchartrain , a large lake to the north of New Orleans , in Louisiana . \nThe world 's largest skimmer is one recent arrival to the Gulf Rough weather since Hurricane Alex passed through the Gulf , to the south of the spill , has hampered clean-up operations for the last week . \nTests of a giant tanker refitted to scoop up oil have been inconclusive because of high seas , the ship 's operators said . \nThe first of two relief wells being drilled to permanently cap the well is seven days ahead of schedule , but officials said on Tuesday that it was still likely to be mid-August before the operation could be completed . \nIn the meantime , some of the leaking oil is being piped to the surface from a cap over part of the well . \nBP spokesman Mark Proegler has said the company hopes to connect `` by the end of the week '' a third tanker , Helix Producer , to its collection system to increase capacity to 53,000 barrels a day from the current limit of 28,000 . \nThe Helix Producer will form part of a new collection system involving a so-called floating riser and four vessels which will be able to disconnect and reconnect quickly , reducing the time lost when collection is halted because of rough seas . \nThe new system should be able to handle up to 80,000 barrels of oil a day . \nThe Deepwater Horizon rig - operated by Transocean on behalf of BP and its partners - exploded on 20 April and later sank with the loss of 11 lives , leading to the worst oil spill in US history . \nUS scientists estimate 35-60 ,000 barrels per day are leaking from the well , about one mile -LRB- 1.6 km -RRB- below the surface of the water . \nMud that is heavier than the oil will be pumped into the well to stop the flow of oil . \nCement will then be pumped in to seal it . \nCBC Oil spill reaches New Orleans and Texas - 17 hrs ago Miami Herald Oil 's fingers reach into Louisiana 's inland waters - 23 hrs ago NPR Texas Tar Balls Mean Oil Now Fouls All Gulf States - 29 hrs ago The Independent BP oil spill hitting all gulf states - 33 hrs ago MSNBC BP spill now hitting all Gulf states - 38 hrs ago The pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ? \n"}
{"id": "516", "time": "2010-07-06", "text": "By Laurence Knight Business reporter , BBC News BP want some way to draw a line under the Gulf of Mexico disaster and move on Things are not so bad now . \nBP 's share price - which had more than halved since the Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion in April first triggered the company 's woes - has staged an impressive recovery in recent weeks . \nYet talk continues to circulate of a possible strategic investor in BP - either as a welcome provider of fresh capital to the company , or an unwelcome opportunist sniffing a bargain . \nSo what are the options now for BP ? \nOn 16 June , the cost of buying financial protection for one year against a possible debt default by BP reached a staggering 10 % . \nI think markets are -LRB- pricing in -RRB- a scenario considerably bleaker than will prove to be the case . '' \nEnd Quote Alan Sinclair Oil and gas analyst , Seymour Pierce During those panicky days , credit markets were in effect saying that a BP bankruptcy in the next few years was more likely than not . \nThings have calmed down since then , although the oil giant 's bonds still trade at prices comparable with companies rated `` junk '' , even though the credit rating agencies have yet to actually stick that ignominious label on BP . \nThe about turn has been extraordinary . \nBefore its money and reputation began bleeding away in the Gulf of Mexico , the oil giant was considered the safest of blue chip companies , because its debts were so low and its income so high . \n`` I think markets are -LRB- pricing in -RRB- a scenario considerably bleaker than will prove to be the case , '' says Alan Sinclair , oil and gas analyst at stock brokers Seymour Pierce . \nHe points out that just by canceling its remaining dividends this year , the company should already have enough money in hand to cover what he expects to be the $ 6bn -LRB- # 4bn -RRB- direct cost of the clean-up . \nThat is about double what the company has already forked out to date . \n`` If you add in all the civil liabilities ... I would be surprised if it comes to more than the $ 20bn they already agreed to set aside , '' Mr Sinclair adds , on the assumption that the relief wells currently being drilled succeed in stopping the leak in August . \nThe company could seek ways to limit its liability to the oil spill . \nThere is already a statutory limit under US law for oil spill costs of a mere $ 75m , but BP long ago waived this limit , as hiding behind it would have been politically untenable . \nHowever , BP had two co-investors in the Deepwater Horizon well - Anadarko of the US and Mitsui of Japan - who together own 35 % of the project . \nThe UK company has called on its partners to pay their share of the spiralling costs , and Mr Sinclair thinks that if it comes to a legal fight , BP would prevail . \nThe oil firm could also take more active steps to limit its liability , for instance through a selective bankruptcy of its US business . \nBut this would almost certainly be unpalatable to the company 's board , as it would enrage US politicians , including President Barack Obama , and probably cut off the entire US market to BP . \nSo the political reality is that BP 's liability in the Gulf of Mexico remains unlimited , and this continues to weigh down the company 's share price . \nStrategic investor or acquisition target ? \nIn this context , speculation has arisen that BP may look to an outside investor to provide a capital injection to help cover these costs . \nShare price lowest point -LRB- on 25 June -RRB- : 296p -LRB- 55 % fall -RRB- Credit default swap spread -LRB- 5 years -RRB- : 4.1 % per annum Data : Bloomberg as of 6 July 2010 Or alternatively it could fall victim to an unwanted suitor looking to buy up the company cheaply on the stock market . \nKuwait is high on the list . \nIt has had a relationship with the company ever since the UK government sold British Petroleum on the stock exchange in 1987 . \nBut Kuwait 's involvement in that flotation serves as a useful case study in the politics of such investments . \nThe Kuwait Investment Authority helpfully bought almost 30 % of the company after the sale was almost derailed by the stock market crash . \nBut the Arabs later came under pressure from Downing Street to give up hopes of a takeover and scale back their investment . \nYet today Kuwait may be the most attractive suitor . \nOn Monday , Libya voiced interest in making a grab for the company . \nResource-hungry China is also mentioned as a possibility . \nIts national oil company attempted to buy California 's Unocal in 2005 , only to be blocked by the White House on national security grounds . \nAmong fellow oil companies , the names of Exxon Mobil and Shell are also being bandied about . \nBut the resulting company might be unacceptably big and powerful for US and European anti-trust authorities . \n`` Even in Europe , the EU would have a fit about the anti-trust implications , '' says Mr Sinclair of Seymour Pierce . \nIndeed , he thinks the entire idea of an investor buying BP itself is questionable . \nLibya may be one of the less welcome suitors `` Why take on a company that is about to undertake several years of litigation ... -LRB- with -RRB- unquantifiable potential civil penalties ? '' \nInstead , he points to asset sales by BP as the likely way forwards . \nBP could for example spin off US subsidiary Atlantic Richfield to one of its rivals . \nOr it could sell individual wells and exploration rights to the Chinese . \nThis would minimize both political and anti-trust issues , and allow BP 's existing management to keep control . \n`` BP can afford to fork out $ 4bn a year by selling assets ... and being flexible about -LRB- capital expenditure -RRB- , '' notes Mr Sinclair . \nThe last possibility , and one that some market participants may be considering seriously again , is that BP will recover fully from its current debacle . \nHaving promised to set aside $ 20bn in a dedicated `` escrow '' account , some are hopeful there may be a tacit agreement with the White House that this figure will represent a cap on the company 's liabilities . \nThe pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ? \n"}

'' \nOil has been leaking from a damaged well in the Gulf of Mexico since a BP-operated drilling platform , Deepwater Horizon , exploded and sank in April . \nAnd though BP says it is now able to gather some 10,000 barrels of oil a day , using a device that siphons oil up to surface ships , thousands of barrels of oil continue to gush daily from the ocean floor . \nThe US administration has already called the leak the biggest environmental catastrophe in the country 's history . \nMr Chernyaev said that his team had held numerous discussions about the oil spill in the Gulf and the Russians would be ready to come to the rescue - but only if everything was done properly . \nThe subs have discovered reserves of gas hydrates on the bottom of the lake Standing on a barge that transports the two subs after their submersion , the Mir-2 captain underlined that the subs were probably the only deep-sea vessels in the world capable of stopping the leak . \n`` Our subs are unique . \nThere are two of them and they can submerge and work simultaneously . \nAlso , they are powerful enough to work with any other additional equipment . \n`` There are only four vessels in the world that can go down to 6,000 m - the Mirs , French Nautile and Japanese Shinkai . \nThe Mirs are known to be the best , and we have a very experienced team of specialists , '' he said . \nBut Mr Chernyaev added that such an operation would have a chance of succeeding only if BP or the US government asked the Russian government to join efforts to stop the leak . \nMr Chernyaev said the problem had to be addressed at the highest level `` It should all be decided on the government level . \nAsking -LRB- Anatoly -RRB- Sagalevich -LRB- of Russia 's Shirshov Institute of Oceanology , which owns the subs -RRB- to simply bring the Mirs over is nonsense . \nEven though we 're able to go to much greater depths than where the damaged well is located , we would n't be able to do much on our own . \n`` We need a team of international specialists and we have to know all the details and probably even build a special device to attach to the subs , and all this needs time , '' said Mr Chernyaev . \nHe explained that the subs had already worked in much harsher conditions , such as the Arctic . \nThe submersible 's pilot also said that the Russians were very surprised that BP and the US government had not asked them for help from the beginning . \n`` And we would not refuse to help , even though for us it would be very complicated , especially right now , when we 're already working on Baikal . \nBut it does n't look like anyone seriously wants our help , '' he added . \nMr Chernyaev was one of the pilots on the first manned descent to the seabed under the geographic North Pole , carried out using the Mir mini-submarines . \nThe expedition was widely reported as a bid to further Moscow 's territorial claims in the Arctic . \nThe Mir submersibles can dive to a depth of about 6,000 m The two submersibles started their third season of exploration in Lake Baikal on 1 July . \nOver the last two expeditions , they found reserves of gas hydrates on the lake bed - which some consider a possible alternative fuel source of the future . \nGas hydrates are usually formed in permafrost or deep in the oceans . \nThese are crystalline water-based solids ; gases such as methane are trapped inside them within cages of hydrogen-bonded water molecules . \nBaikal is the only freshwater basin where gas hydrates are found in its sediments . \nScientists say the depth of the lake - reaching 1,637 m - and extremely low temperatures of water near the lake bed both help gas hydrates form at depths exceeding 350m . \nThe current expedition aims to obtain important data about these findings , and is also searching for new life forms , which might be unique to Baikal . \nLocated in eastern Siberia , not far from the Mongolian border , the lake holds one-fifth of the planet 's fresh water and many unique species of plants and animals , among them the nerpa - a species of freshwater seal . \nThe pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ? \n"}

'' \nDoug Suttles , BP 's chief operating officer of exploration and production , said the company was spending $ 6m a day trying to clean up the spill and stop the leak . \nIt is more likely to prompt a gut feeling -LRB- in the markets -RRB- that the crisis will be expensive and damaging for the company Russell Corn , corporate analysis firm Diligence But he said it was n't clear what had caused the spillage . \nHe told US broadcaster ABC : `` The company that owned the drilling rig and that owned the blowout preventer was Transocean and they were actually operating the rig . \n`` At the time the accident happened , the safety devices , we would have believed would have stopped the flow of oil , they did n't do that . \nWe do n't know why they did n't do that and ultimately we will find out . '' \nBP 's share price has already taken a big hit - dropping by 6.5 % on Thursday after the US Coast Guard said five times as much oil as previously estimated was pouring into the gulf . \nOil industry expert Michael Lynch , writing on the website of Gerson Lehrman Group , said containment and remedial costs could easily exceed $ 500m - and a wave of litigation seems sure to follow . \n`` Control of the well is without question the responsibility of BP , '' he said . \n`` Should an investigation reveal some fault on the part of Transocean , it is possible they could be held jointly responsible . \nBut all of the indications are that the explosion was the result of a ` kick ' - abnormal pressure from the crude oil reservoir at the bottom of the well driving a volume of natural gas to the surface . \n`` In any event , the total cost to BP is likely to exceed $ 1bn and could rise to double that . \nWith crude oil prices at their present levels , BP could earn perhaps $ 20bn for 2010 before the disaster charges , '' he added . \nBP and Transocean officials are working with the US Coast Guard Russell Corn , Deputy CEO of corporate analysis company Diligence , told the BBC the disaster `` will be preoccupying senior management to an increasing degree '' . \n`` It is more likely to prompt a gut feeling -LRB- in the markets -RRB- that the crisis will be expensive and damaging for the company and will therefore result in some form of negative sentiment around the stock , '' he said . \nStephen Cheliotis , of The Centre for Brand Analysis in London , told the BBC that environmental disasters can badly affect the image of oil industry giants . \n`` It can have a major impact on a brand , and it can damage a brand in the long term , '' he said . \n`` A lot of people would link , for instance , Exxon with the Exxon Valdez disaster . '' \nHe added that the oil spill had come at a bad time for BP , in a week when it was announcing substantial profits . \n`` In the eyes of the public this might be seen as crass and might affect their opinion of the company , '' he said . \nTom Zara , of brand consultancy Interbrand in New York , said BP had worked to be associated with alternative energy and this incident will remind the world of the `` negative associations '' of fossil fuels . \nThere could therefore be an erosion of the goodwill of the brand overall , he said . \nHow BP responds will be crucial , he added . \n`` If the brand responds in the wrong way , it may be that long-term damage will be done to their ability to influence governments , NGOs and regulators . \nBut people wo n't stop buying from BP gas stations , '' he said . \nAlthough BP has emphasised its speedy response to the disaster - and its co-operation with US investigations into the accident - its reputation in the US has suffered following previous incidents . \nIn December 2009 a Texan jury awarded $ 100m -LRB- # 62m -RRB- in damages to 10 workers at a BP oil refinery who said a leak in 2007 had made them ill . \nBP maintained that any toxic substance had come from outside the refinery - the same plant that had suffered the explosion in 2005 - and the source of the leak was never identified . \nBut lawyers for the workers described BP as `` a serial polluter '' - and the jury backed their case . \n"}

'' \nMr Suttles estimated something between 1,000 and 5,000 barrels a day was leaking . \nMeanwhile , a firefighting expert said the disaster may become the biggest oil spill ever . \nMike Miller , head of Canadian oil well firefighting company Safety Boss , told the BBC World Service : `` Probably the only thing comparable to this is the Kuwait fires -LRB- following the Gulf War in 1991 -RRB- . \n`` The Exxon Valdez is going to pale in comparison to this as it goes on . '' \nScientists say only a quarter of local marine wildlife survived the Exxon Valdez disaster . \nThe scale of the operation to contain the oil spill and protect both the US coastline and wildlife is unprecedented , with the military and other government agencies collaborating with BP - which had hired the sunken rig - and industry leaders . \nHow the oil has spread Approximate oil locations 22 April - 15 May Efforts to stem the flow are being complicated by the depth of the leak at the underwater well , which is about 5,000 ft -LRB- 1,525 m -RRB- beneath the surface . \nA coastguard crew has set fire to part of the oil slick in an attempt to save environmentally-fragile wetlands . \nA `` controlled burn '' of surface oil took place in an area about 30 miles -LRB- 50km -RRB- east of the Mississippi River delta . \nBut Mr Miller warned that burning off leaking oil was not a long-term solution . \n`` The object of this game is to shut off the flow , '' he said . \nEngineers are working on a dome-like device to cover oil rising to the surface and pump it to container vessels , but it may be weeks before this is in place . \n1991 : 520m gallons were deliberately released from Iraqi oil tankers during the first Gulf War to impede the US invasion 1979 : 140m gallons were spilt over nine months after a well blow-out in the Bay of Campeche off Mexico 's coast 1979 : 90m gallons leaked from a Greek oil tanker after it collided with another ship off the coast of Trinidad 1983 : 80m gallons leaked into the Gulf over several months after a tanker collided with a drilling platform 1989 : 11m gallons were spilt into Alaska 's Prince William Sound in the Exxon Valdez disaster It is feared that work on sealing the leaking well using robotic submersibles might take months . \nBP is also working on a `` relief well '' to intersect the original well , but this is experimental and could take two to three months to stop the flow . \nSeventy vessels - oil skimmers , tugboats barges and special recovery boats that separate oil from water - as well as five aeroplanes , were working to spray dispersants and round up oil , BP said . \nEleven workers are missing and presumed dead after the worst oil rig disaster in almost a decade . \nLouisiana 's coast contains some 40 % of the nation 's wetlands and spawning grounds for countless fish and birds . \nAFP news agency reports that two Louisiana shrimpers have filed a lawsuit accusing the operators of the rig of negligence , and seeking at least $ 5m in damages plus undetermined punitive damages . \n"}

{"id": "1116", "time": "2010-07-13", "text": "By Finlo Rohrer BBC News , Washington There have been many devastating images from the Gulf WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THE OIL ? \n`` The good news is that oil is a natural product and is relatively easily degraded , '' says Prof Ed Overton , an environmental scientist at Louisiana State University . \nSome of the oil will be picked up by skimmers Oil which has not been dispersed or washed up on shore will be targeted by microbes . \n`` They use the oil as a food , '' says Prof Overton . \nThere is an advantage in that the spill happened in the warm Gulf of Mexico , where conditions are good for decomposition . \nIn colder climes , things can be harder . \n`` Contrast that with Exxon Valdez where you still have beaches where you can kick over cobblestones and still have pools of oil beneath them , '' says Stan Senner , director of conservation science for Ocean Conservancy . \n`` In the Gulf of Mexico it is a different environment . \nThere is some greater capacity for that environment to handle hydrocarbons . '' \nBut that is not to say the oil will totally vanish . \nThere may be oil which becomes buried on shore , and oil may end up at the bottom of the sea in anaerobic areas - places where there is no oxygen to allow the microbes to do their work . \n`` We have never seen these clouds or plumes of oil dispersed in tiny droplets in the water , '' says Mr Senner . \n`` We do n't know how much is ending up on the bottom . \nOnshore , we do n't know how much is being buried . '' \nWHAT WILL THE EFFECT BE ON THE WETLANDS ? \nThe Gulf Coast 's wetlands are home to a diverse range of wildlife `` The wetlands that are already impacted , if only the stems and the grass you see on the surface are affected then the recovery will be within one or two years , '' says Dr Larry McKinney , director of the Harte Research Institute for Gulf of Mexico Studies . \n`` If the oil has penetrated down to the roots , then you are going to lose those areas altogether . \n-LRB- Wetlands -RRB- will go to open water and will never recover . '' \nIt 's hard at this juncture to tell what the eventual effect will be on the northern Gulf Coast 's habitat . \n`` A coating on the leaves will kill the leaves but it does n't necessarily kill the plant , '' says Prof Overton . \n`` With events like this their impacts occur in different phases , '' says Mr Senner . \nFirst there is the initial wave of deaths , the animals that get covered in oil and die . \nLonger-lived animal populations will take years to recover The death toll Mr Senner is aware of already includes a `` thousand bird carcasses - half of them are oiled , others are just carcasses , a few hundred turtles , 50 or so dolphins '' . \nBut those small numbers reflect the fact that only a small percentage of carcasses are recovered . \n`` The assumption is that the actual mortality rate is many times what has been recovered , '' says Mr Senner . \n`` The rule of thumb for the bird carcasses is that they find one in 10 , but that could be low . '' \nThe question everybody will be asking is how quickly can animal numbers return to normal . \nIt all depends on the life span of the animal . \nIn the Ixtoc spill of 1979 , there was a 60-70 % reduction in shrimp in the year of the spill , but they were back to normal within one or two years , says Dr McKinney . \nThen there are longer-lived animals like dolphins , whale sharks and sea turtles . \nIf a single generation has been largely wiped out , numbers might not fully recover for 10-20 years . \nAnd then there are the truly long-lived organisms . \n`` For deepwater solitary coral communities , their lifespan is in hundreds of years , '' says Dr McKinney . \nWhat will the effect of widespread use of the dispersant Corexit be ? \nWill migrating birds be severely affected ? \nHow much oil has actually been spilled ? \nHow much is buried in fragile wetland habitats ? \nWhat is the effect of oil on deep-sea ecosystems ? \nThey could potentially be vulnerable to the oil or to patches of oxygen-depleted water created by the oil-eating microbes . \nWhen the microbes degrade the oil , oxygen is used up and carbon dioxide is produced . \nDr McKinney is worried about `` huge clouds of low-oxygen oil dispersant mix , -LRB- which is -RRB- methane-heavy '' . \nThe plus side for fish stocks on the other hand is that , severe as the damage might be , it will be mitigated by the break in fishing . \n`` They have closed such large areas of the Gulf that the pressure has been reduced , '' says Dr McKinney . \n`` Reducing the fishing pressure will allow more fish to remain alive and reproduce . '' \nSo stocks of fish like red snapper could be back to normal within two to four years . \nBut , the effect of the spill on species that are already under immense pressure - like Atlantic bluefin tuna - could be severe . \nHOW WILL ECOSYSTEMS BE CHANGED ? \n`` In ecosystems , when you wipe out large segments of them , the ecosystem responds to the absence of those things and other things come in to take their place and you do n't return to the way things were , '' says Mr Senner . \n`` Ecosystems are always dynamic . \nWhat we see in the Gulf of Mexico is an ecosystem that already had a number of stresses on it . '' \nSome animals and plants may be badly affected by the disruption of the spill and not regain their previous place in the ecosystem once conditions return to normal . \nBut they will be replaced by other organisms . \nA lot of the thinking about the effects of the BP oil spill is informed by the work done following the Ixtoc spill of 1979 . \nBut there are some aspects of the latest spill about which scientists find it hard even to speculate . \nMarine biologists will admit that not a great deal is known about the effects of oil on organisms in deep water . \n`` We know almost nothing about the ecology in the deep ocean , '' says Prof Overton . \nIt may offer only a crumb of comfort , but the 2010 spill will one day provide that knowledge . \nThe pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ? \n"}

ON Ruhrgas sold a Gazprom stake . \nAnd while the reasons for the sales might be unrelated to the general investment climate in Russia , they were seen by many as another example of investors ' fears . \nSeen in this perspective , the Rosneft-BP deal gives the Russian government a chance to show that the climate is not as bad as some critics say . \nAs Mr Dudley put it : `` It 's my hope that you will see this step of cooperation with Rosneft as a very strong signal from BP in our confidence in the investment climate in Russia . '' \nBut the shadow of Yukos , once a giant oil company owned by Russian oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky , could create troubles for both Rosneft and BP . \nAfter the oligarch found himself behind bars and the company went bankrupt in 2004 , Rosneft bought its main asset . \nAs a result , Yukos shareholders are suing Russia in the European Court of Human Rights , seeking $ 98bn -LRB- # 62bn -RRB- . \n`` BP shareholders should be concerned that once again the company has invested in a deal with Rosneft in assets over which there is a significant question as to security of Rosneft 's ownership , '' said Claire Davidson , who represents the former Yukos shareholders . \nMeanwhile , the former Yukos lawyer , Robert Amsterdam , believes that BP is taking a serious risk placing trust in the Russian officials . \n`` It is impossible to imagine a scenario in which the two companies -LRB- Rosneft and BP -RRB- have a dispute that is not artificially resolved in favor of Rosneft and its owners in the government of the Russian Federation , '' he wrote in his blog . \nOn the other hand , experts say that there are some risks in the deal for Rosneft as BP shareholder . \nFinancial services firm JP Morgan estimates that the total fine for BP could reach $ 69bn if the company is charged with gross negligence over the Mexican Gulf oil spill . \nAccording to estimates , BP and Rosneft will be required to invest up to $ 2bn in the first stage of the Arctic project - seismic testing and drilling wells . \nMr Putin said last week that Russia 's Arctic offshore might hold 5bn tonnes of oil resources and 10 trillion cubic metres of gas . \n`` These are serious figures that need further confirmation , but they are quite realistic and I hope that these estimated resources will become proven reserves , '' said Mr Putin . \nIf his words come to be true and the two sides manage to remain on good terms with each other , both BP and Rosneft could get a huge prize for what is seen by some as a gamble . \nThe pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ? \n"}

could throw them & I do n't blame them . \nThis tragedy is going to last for years at least 10 to 15 & President Obama will be probably gone from office in eight years ... but if this is not rightly

out paments fairly , & pay same as soon as possible . \nBP ... your die could be nearly cast . \nBP 's Tony Hayward has n't been very honest with the US media & he wo n't even give interviews directly with any of the big broadcasters , so the media in the US are really going for BP in a big way & they are pressurizing the Federal Government to act harshly against BP . \nBP are no angels in the debacle when they would n't allow scientists to study video of the daily output for analysis & wo n't even pay minimum compensation to businesses that are\\/have been ruined by the spill , or at least are delaying as long as they can the process . \nNot to talk of the environment that will take at least ten to fifteen years to put right ... & all the fixes have n't gone in any way to lessen the damage or to prevent the environment disaster spreading to a greater magnitude , in fact they 've made things worse . \nSo President Obama is in a Catch-22 conundrum ... his country is America & he has to do good by it 's citizens . \nHe will be going on National TV next week to tell the American people what he is going to do at this stage of this catastrophe to tell them how bad it is & is going to get after having taken advise from expert 's in the industry & from Professor 's of Engineering & Marine & Oceanography Science . \nThe main thing of this debacle is that there are human beings in the middle of it through no fault of their own that are without a living after the leak\\/fallout . \nThey are angry that now after the 20th of April explosion & its now June that nothing is solved or improving as regards the spill . \nThey are angry that BP is not being honest with them or has n't been since the first day being honest about the true amount of oil leaking & is playing about with offering an advance of conpensatiion that they promised to affected businesses over the last two weeks . \nThere will be inquirys & law suits a plenty now getting ready to hit the courts & BP may be forced now from the time the President speaks to pass over to the Federal government an x-amount of money to a fund for US government officials to pay out to sincere victims of this tragedy . \nWill Britain\\/US relations suffer ... most likely not because BP promised all along that they would do everything in it 's power to sort it out . \nIt has failed & failed miserbly ... & Tony Hayward could have been more forthright with the people mostly caugt up in its consequences . \nof course Transocean will be caught up in the court battles as well as another party responsible for the spill . \nBP has a bad record over a long period as regards safety , the proof is there if one researches same , but all that would fill a book . \nSo yes , BP has a massive problem on it 's hands & it 's getting worse by the day ... but one thing that would help greatly is if Tony Hayward would act & talk like he is really concerned for the two most important things in this tragedy , the environment & especially the human beings caught up in it . \nThen & only then can he get his LIFE that he craves so much with his lifestyle back . \nOne truth though for you Tony is , the road back home is going to take some time . \nAt 02:21 am on 16 Jun 2010 , AdamM wrote : Honestly it does n't matter who built the rig BP took liability over it when they leased the rig from the company .

For all his praise of the House climate bill and talk about the `` consequences of inaction '' and so forth , not once did he utter the phrase , `` It 's time to put a price on carbon . '' \nAnd that suggests to me that this speech was primarily about containing the damage to his administration , and was not the pivot point in the energy debate that many people were hoping for . \n2155 : Kedar from India writes : We make BP pay for this damage . \nWho will pay India for the Bhopal gas tragedy ? \n2152 : Taegan Goddard , Political Wire Though Obama called for a `` national mission '' to transition to clean energy , he was vague on what he actually wants to see in a comprehensive energy bill . \nIn doing so , Obama is just another president that has refused to ask Americans for the necessary sacrifice to finally achieve this greater national goal . \nHe missed a golden opportunity . \n2150 : Energy politics blogger David Roberts tweets : I feel like , unlike Congress , the public is desperate for purpose and ambition right now . \nEverything Obama 's doing is ... managerial . \nRead David Roberts 's tweets 2140 : Daniel K from Philadelphia , US , writes : I think Obama gave a good speech , and it was exactly what we need to hear from a leader about this crisis . \n2137 : The BBC 's Paul Adams in Washington When the president speaks from the Oval Office , it 's serious , and it 's personal . \nThis was Barack Obama attempting to show that he is now in charge of dealing with the worst environmental disaster in US history . \nHe spoke in lofty terms about moving away from fossil fuels , embracing a clean-energy future and shaping the country 's destiny . \nBut most Americans just want the leak to stop and that , two months after it began , remains a distant prospect . \n2135 : Bpdeadbirds uses data from a Deepwater Horizon Response report to provide updates on the total number of animals that have died apparently due to the spill . \nIt tweets : `` Today 's BP death tally : 770 birds , 341 sea turtles , 41 mammals .

'' \n2013 : President Obama takes a passionate tone , asserting that the `` the time to embrace a clean energy future is now '' . \nEmphasis on the `` now '' . \n2013 : Now , President Obama reflects President Johnson 's same concerns three decades ago : `` Time and again , the path forward has been blocked - not only by oil industry lobbyists , but also by a lack of political courage and candor . '' \n2011 : Mark Knoller from CBS News tweets : Obama concedes that no matter how effective our response becomes , there will be more oil and more damage before this siege is done . \nRead Mark Knoller 's tweets 2011 : The BBC 's Paul Adams in Washington At a time when the president and his administration face criticism over the speed and scale of the federal response , the president quickly sets out the extent of what he calls `` the largest environmental cleanup effort in our nation 's history '' , while admitting that `` there will be more oil and more damage before this siege is done '' . \n2010 : President Obama takes his first shot at his Republican opponents , saying that the mismanagement of the Minerals Management Service is `` emblematic of a failed philosophy that views all regulation with hostility - a philosophy that says corporations should be allowed to play by their own rules and police themselves '' . \n2009 : President Obama says an independent third party will adjudicate claims for compensation , but gives very few details about how that process will work . \nExpect Press Secretary Gibbs to be bombarded with questions about that in the coming days . \n2007 : President Obama 's tone is firm but calm and even . \nThis is no Lyndon Johnson `` bullhorn '' moment , but he 's not echoing Jimmy Carter 's `` malaise '' themes either . \nIt seems he 's doing his best to be reassuring . \nPerhaps the best analogy is President Clinton ? \n2007 : The BBC 's Paul Adams in Washington `` Unlike an earthquake or a hurricane , '' the president says . \nThis is not his Katrina . \n2005 : Mr Obama uses tough language with regard to BP , saying he will `` make them pay '' . \nBut he does n't dwell on BP , moving on to more positive news about the clean-up effort . \n2003 : Mr Obama opens by chronicling his response to the spill - perhaps an attempt to instil confidence in his management style ? \n2001 : Following the speech , White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs will answer questions from the public . \nFor more details go to the White House website . \n1957 : Some interesting poll numbers provide context for tonight : according to Gallup , 59 % of Americans believe BP should pay for damages and lost wages , even if it forces the company into bankruptcy . \nAnd 71 % do n't think President Obama has been tough enough on BP . \n1955 : Although Mr Obama is expected to have harsh words for BP tonight , Walter Shapiro of Politics Daily says : `` An Oval Office address is too rare and too important a presidential event to waste time scoring cheap political points at the expense of BP .

'' \nHis father taught him to make palm wine but today the trees yield only a quarter of what they once provided . \nKpor is a world away from the Gulf of Mexico . \nIn the Niger Delta , there is little independent monitoring of spills , and the companies themselves disclose virtually no data about their own pollution . \nBut , according to the Nigerian government , there were more than 7,000 spills between 1970 and 2000 . \nEnvironmentalists believe spills - large and small - happen at a rate of 300 every year . \nSite after site visited by the BBC - in both Bayelsa State and Ogoniland - had happened months before , and still not been cleaned up . \nIn May an Exxon Mobil pipeline in Akwa Ibom sprang a leak - one of several spills involving the company . \nEnvironmentalists , journalists and local people described oil leaking for days in a massive spill . \nThey say the leak was less than 300 barrels and that it was isolated on the same day . \nThe claims of the oil company , and the scepticism of environmentalists , are a good example of how little clear agreement there is about the size of spills . \n`` The Gulf of Mexico has drawn the attention of the whole world , '' says Erabanabari Kobah , a local environmentalist . \n`` Even the president of the United States must go there to see it . \nThe people there get compensation . \nBut here , you must go to court . \nYou can not win against the oil companies in court . ' \nThe oil industry is accused of a sharp double standard in its operations - of taking advantage of Nigeria 's lack of environment law and weak regulation , while observing higher standards of safety and maintenance overseas . \n`` It is a grave situation , '' says Kingsley Ogundu Chinda , environment commissioner in Rivers State . \n`` I blame the owners of the facilities . \nThey are economical with the truth . \nThey are not sincere in their practice . \nThey are not sincere with the people . '' \nHe also says the government has failed to force companies to observe the law . \nThe joint ventures operating here are effectively Nigerian companies , operating under Nigerian law . \nThe Bille 2 Awoba Flowstation is guarded by the military Shell , for example , owns only a 30 % stake in SPDC - the Shell Petroleum Development Company . \nThe rest is Nigeria 's national oil company , the NNPC , and smaller stakeholders . \nThe industry certainly has the spotlight - but not all of the power - nor all of the responsibility . \nIt is a dangerous and unpredictable business . \nOil workers and oil contractors are regularly kidnapped for ransom . \nHeavily armed militants blow up pipelines , stealing oil in a process known as `` bunkering '' . \nShell says most of the spills are caused by sabotage , and therefore beyond their control . \nIt is impossible to verify . \n`` We take every precaution that a spill as a result of our operation is kept to an absolute minimum , '' says Mutiu Sunmonu , Shell 's managing director in Nigeria . \n`` I can tell you that we have been able to achieve that in terms of the spills that are within our control . '' \nBut oil industry insiders also speak of derelict infrastructure . \nThey talk of decades-old pipelines , rusting oil taps , corroding manifolds , and historic underinvestment reaching back decades . \nWe decided to examine flow stations and pipelines for ourselves . \n`` Getting close is not easy , '' shouts Evangelist Ibinabobo Sanipe , over the roar of the speedboat . \nAs national secretary of the Oil and Gas Host Communities Association , he is traveling with us . \nOil companies ' business in Nigeria , and their participation here , is a force for good '' End Quote Mutiu Sunmonu Shell 's managing director `` The military guard this place fiercely , '' he warns . \nWe bounce above the waves towards a column of dark smoke on the horizon , it is the Bille 2 Awoba Flowstation . \nBefore long , a big military vessel warns us to pull over , with our hands in the air . \nBut with just a few jokes and handshakes , the soldiers are smiling and joking . \nWe continue our journey , having paid no bribe , and shown no identification . \nCloser to the station , orange flames flicker through the trees , and the air is thick with fumes . \nAnother military patrol is just metres away , behind the station , but we 're out of sight . \nFor 25 minutes , we film the roaring gas flares , before two men in a canoe ask us to leave . \n`` It is very disturbing , '' says Evangelist Sanipe . \n`` If Shell is serious about stopping sabotage and oil spills , we would not have got so close . '' \nBut protecting oil facilities from attack by armed gangs is the responsibility of the Nigerian military . \nIn the past , spectacular attacks on oil facilities in Nigeria have threatened the country 's energy security , and delivered shocks to the global oil markets . \nThe ease with which we reached the Awoba Flowstation will raise questions over the security of oil facilities . \nIt is clear that the desperate efforts to halt the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the US have prompted many Nigerians to look hard at their own environmental catastrophe . \nThere is a sense of anger , even among those a long way from the Delta . \nShell insists it is misplaced . \n`` I have no regrets , '' insists Mutiu Sunmonu , Shell 's managing director . \n`` I am convinced that the oil companies ' business in Nigeria , and their participation here , is a force for good .

'' \nThousands of barrels of oil have been leaking into the Gulf of Mexico every day since the rig sank . \nSome oil has washed ashore , but officials say the bulk of the slick remains a few miles from the Louisiana coastline . \nThe oil is already having a devastating effect on the area 's fishing industry , and officials fear much wider environmental damage if the full slick hits land . \nForecasters said south-westerly winds on Monday were pushing the slick towards Florida . \nMr Hayward said BP was making a three-pronged effort to stop the leak : Undersea robots are working on the safety valve which failed , allowing the oil to escape A containment vessel is being sent to the site and would , in effect , suck up the escaped oil BP is drilling a new well to help relieve the pressure and stem the flow from the rupture Experts warn that the cost of clearing up the spill could run into billions of dollars . \nBP has said it will honor legitimate claims for compensation from people affected . \nThe firm 's shares continued to fall on Monday , after previous trading had seen about $ 20bn wiped from its market value since the accident . \nUK markets were closed on Monday , but BP 's Frankfurt-listed shares opened 8 % lower before clawing back some of the losses . \nAnalysts say the costs associated with the slick are uncertain , meaning that the share price was likely to remain volatile while the leak continues . \nIn California , Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger withdrew his support for a plan to expand oil exploration off the state 's coast . \nHe said seeing TV images of the spill in the Gulf had changed his mind about the safety of offshore oil platforms in the Pacific Ocean . \nHe had supported more drilling as a way to ease the state 's budget deficit . \n"}
{"id": "1817", "time": "2010-06-24", "text": "In the Gulf of Mexico , oil continues to hemorrhage from a deep sea well nearly a mile beneath the ocean and about forty miles off the US coast . \nAlthough estimates vary , the growing consensus among scientists is that even with the cap that has now been placed over the leak , some 35,000 to 60,000 barrels per day of crude oil are continuing to flow into the waters of the Gulf . \nLatest estimates suggest that some 3m barrels of oil have already entered the seas since the Deepwater Horizon rig sunk on April 20 . \nParts of Caribbean at risk So far it has been the US that has suffered , but as the hurricane season gets underway and ocean currents undergo seasonal changes , there is a slight but hard to predict possibility that if the flow is not stopped in August when relief wells being drilled by BP are expected to be complete , some parts of the Western Caribbean could also be at risk . \nThe Caribbean islands might be affected us the leak is not contained Forecasting hurricane frequency , intensity and tracking is a far from exact science ; but the suggestion this year is that higher than average sea temperatures in the Caribbean Sea may result in greater activity and intensity and for hurricanes to form off the southeast coast of the US in the Gulf of Mexico , or in the northeastern Caribbean . \nConcern about the spill was raised when Cariforum Foreign Ministers met the US Secretary of State , Hilary Clinton in Barbados on June 18th . \nThere , in what was described as a sobering analysis , the Bahamian Foreign Minister , Brent Symonette , spoke about the consequences of the oil reaching Caribbean shores . \nMost experts believe this possibility to be slight . \nThis is because the ocean currents in and around the Caribbean move in north-westerly direction from the Eastern Caribbean to the Gulf of Mexico . \nThey then join the Yucatan Current and the Florida Current , looping southwards around the west coast of Florida before proceeding on and up the eastern coast of the US . \nA report from the Mona Institute of Applied Sciences -LRB- MIAS -RRB- at the University the West Indies suggests that as the oil disperses from the spill site it will in time likely travel south , join the loop current and eventually follow it around Florida and along the US Atlantic coast and away from most of the Caribbean . \nConfirming this , in the short term , charts and diagrams produced by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration -LRB- NOAA -RRB- suggest any oil bearing currents will follow an offshore course past Havana to the north of the Cuban coast , before turning and passing to the west of the Bahamas . \nHowever elements of unpredictability exist should any hurricane develop in the Gulf of Mexico causing sea surges and changes in the movement of the undersea currents . \nMIAS 's conclusion is that although any imminent threat to Caribbean beaches and wildlife seems unlikely , the Caribbean needs to formulate a response plan to protect the beaches that sustain its economy and wildlife . \nSuch considerations apart , the spill is having a number of immediate side effects . \nAlthough it has only marginally affected the timing of cruise ship sailings to the Caribbean , major lines like Carnival will not sail at night near the areas where the oil spill is . \nCruise lines like ` Oasis of the Ocean ' might not sail at night near the affected areas Cruise lines are also having to inspect ships for contaminated hulls . \nMore positively the price for Surinamese and Guyanese shrimp has surged as US Gulf Coast suppliers have had to turn to imports and cease domestic operations . \nMore significantly , what has happened is leading globally to questions being asked about the risks associated with the recovery of oil at greater or lesser depths in environmentally sensitive waters in regions such as the Caribbean . \nThis together with the continuing uncertainties surrounding oil prices and high levels of regional indebtedness suggests that the Caribbean as a whole ought to be giving greater thought to the promotion of investment in sources of sustainable energy and how this might be linked to investment , development assistance and to carbon credits . \nSome nations have already understood this . \nLast week a delegation from the Cuban energy sector has been in the UK and Italy meeting with industry specialists and potential investors and their advisers to discuss opportunities relating to using biomass , hydro power and other forms of sustainable energy including wind , solar and tidal action . \nWind farms are considered as efficient forms of sustainable energy During their visit what became clear was that Cuba was paying great attention to alternative approaches to power generation , in areas where other large Caribbean nations have equal or better opportunities to encourage investment and external support . \nThis is interesting , not least because Cuba has taken a conscious decision - despite its preferential arrangements with Venezuela , under the PetroCaribe accord - that it will develop a fully sustainable approach initially focusing on using sugar cane as the feedstock for the generation of energy . \nPresident Obama too , irrespective of the powerful US oil lobby , wants to begin to end his nation 's addiction to fossil fuels . \nHe is trying to build on the oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico to encourage a national sense of urgency . \nSpeaking from the White House he suggested that there was a need to embark on a mission to develop clean energy technologies . \nThe consequences of our inaction , he said , were in plain sight . \n`` Countries like China are investing in clean energy jobs and industries ... . \nEach day , we send nearly US$ 1 billion of our wealth to foreign countries for their oil . \nAnd today , as we look to the Gulf , we see an entire way of life being threatened by a menacing cloud of black crude '' . \nIn the Cariforum meeting with Hilary Clinton it was also recognized that energy security and mitigating the impact of climate change were linked and fundamental to the future development , growth and stability . \nPresident Obama 's message resulting from the Deepwater Horizon disaster is as much one for the Caribbean as for the people of the US . \nA heavily indebted region can not expect to receive for ever oil at subsidized prices from Venezuela , a nation that has economic problems of its own . \nIf Cuba can start down a road to developing new sources of energy with external participation , so too should the rest of the region . \nDavid Jessop can be contacted at david.jessop@caribbean-council.org \n"}

'' \nHow quickly things change . \nThen aged 50 , but looking much younger , Mr Hayward now wears a drained , slightly haunted expression . \nThe excitement he showed in the early days of his tenure seems absent today . \nNo wonder , after being declared public enemy No 1 in America . \nMr Hayward has been demonised by the US media as being responsible for the world 's worst environmental disaster - and , let 's not forget , for the deaths of 11 men in the rig explosion that preceded it . \nCritics argue that , as the man in charge , it is Mr Hayward 's job to take the heat . \nNor has he helped his cause with some misguided remarks about wanting his life back and optimistic comments about the clean-up operation . \nBut the hostility must be a crushing weight to bear , especially for a man whose declared intention on becoming chief executive was take a lower profile than his predecessor , Lord -LRB- John -RRB- Browne of Madingley . \nBy the time he departed Lord Browne had become as well known for his celebrity friends and political connections as for his business successes . \nMr Hayward 's appointment was in part a desire by the BP board to get back to basics . \nHe was seen as a old-school oil man , happier having a beer with rig workers than , like Lord Browne , drinking fine wine with prime ministers and presidents . \nWords such as `` informal '' , `` quiet '' or `` easy-going '' are often used to describe his manner . \nBorn in 1957 , the eldest of seven children , Mr Hayward gained a first class geology degree from Aston University , in Birmingham , and PhD from Edinburgh University at the age 22 . \nMarried , with two children , Mr Hayward considered going into academia , but instead went to BP in 1982 and was posted first to Aberdeen , home of the UK 's North Sea oil boom . \nMr Hayward has spoken frequently of his love of the offshore life and of touring the world in various BP jobs . \nBut he was eventually talent-spotted by Lord Browne , and became one of his Turtles -LRB- a name Browne gave to his inner circle of high fliers -RRB- a reference to the fearsome cartoon warriors , the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles . \nMr Hayward rose to become head of exploration and production , a key role in any oil company , and was long identified as Lord Browne 's likely successor . \nWhen Lord Browne resigned after having lied to a UK court about his relationship with a male escort , no one was surprised when Mr Hayward took over . \nBut he had already begun positioning himself , telling a conference some months earlier that BP needed to change its leadership style because it was `` too directive and does n't listen sufficiently well . '' \nMr Svanberg is coming under increasing pressure While Tony Hayward has been made the fall guy by US media for the oil disaster , chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg is increasingly under the spotlight from the UK press . \nSeveral commentators have queried Mr Svanberg 's lack of visibility during the crisis , with Financial Times columnist Jonathan Guthrie saying he is `` proving lower-profile than an agoraphobic prairie dog '' . \nThis may be about to change if reports are correct that Mr Hayward is returning to London , while Mr Svanberg now directs BP 's response to the growing political crisis the company is facing in America . \nMr Svanberg 's supporters point out that he only became chairman in January , and only joined the BP board five months earlier . \nHe has no oil industry experience , having most recently spent six years as president and chief executive of Swedish telecoms group Ericsson . \nHowever , while he may not have been able to answer detailed operational questions , critics say a chairman 's role is to take the lead in times of crisis , especially in dealings with governments and investors . \nWhen he was appointed chairman Mr Svanberg said last year that he recognized it was a big challenge `` following such a distinguished predecessor '' . \nThis predecessor was Peter Sutherland , who cut his teeth in Irish politics and at the European Commission , and is unlikely to have been found on the sidelines if the crisis happened during his watch . \nThere was , at the time , some surprise that BP had gone outside the industry to find Mr Sutherland 's replacement . \nBut , then , so did Royal Dutch Shell , BP 's bigger rival , when it appointed former Nokia boss Jorma Ollila as its chairman . \nMarried , with three children , Mr Svanberg , 57 , has had a distinguished career . \nBorn in the Swedish town of Porjus , inside the Arctic Circle , he received a Masters degree in engineering from the Institute of Technology at Linkoping University . \nAfter graduating in 1977 , he worked for ABB on various foreign assignments , then moving to security company Securitas . \nHe led the spin out of Assa Abloy from Securitas in 1994 and , with the help of numerous acquisitions , boosted turnover seven-fold . \nA big ice hockey fan and accomplished player in his youth , Mr Svanberg took the top job at Ericsson in 2003 , steering a then loss-making company through a big and often painful restructuring . \nHis reward was to be given the King of Sweden 's medal for his contribution to Swedish industry - and to have garnered enough plaudits to make him a contender to chair one of the world 's great energy groups . \nIronically , Mr Svanberg 's single biggest skill , according to one analyst who has watched his career , is `` stewarding companies through difficult times '' . \nThere are many observers who think that Mr Svanberg could be putting that skill to better use today . \nThe pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ? \n"}

{"id": "1356", "time": "2010-05-05", "text": "John Curry , from BP , explains how the funnel should work A giant iron funnel being built in a bid to halt the huge spill from a Gulf of Mexico well will be deployed to the seabed on Thursday , BP says . \nThe 98-tonne , dome-topped box being built by steel workers will be connected to a drill ship and lowered to the sea floor . \nBP has never deployed such a structure at a depth of 5,000 ft -LRB- 1,500 m -RRB- and difficulties may occur , it says . \n`` There 's no guarantees , '' BP boss Tony Hayward told AP news agency . \n`` We 'll undoubtedly encounter some issues as we go through that process . \n`` But if that was a good outcome , then you would have the principal leak contained by the early part of next week , '' Mr Hayward said . \nBP has accepted it is `` absolutely responsible '' for cleaning up the spill caused by a blast on a drilling rig . \nIts shares have plunged more than 15 % since the 22 April explosion . \nIt is estimated that the clean-up could cost BP up to $ 15bn -LRB- # 10bn -RRB- . \nBP insists that the rig 's contractor , Transocean , was to blame for the accident but , under US law , it has to bear the cost of the clean-up as the operator of the oilfield . \nArnold Schwarzenegger : `` It will not happen here '' Both companies are expecting lawsuits over the slick , which US President Barack Obama described as a `` potentially unprecedented '' environmental disaster . \nCalifornian Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has withdrawn his support for a plan to expand oil exploration off that state 's coast , saying he has changed his mind about the safety of oil platforms in the Pacific Ocean . \nAfter seeing television pictures of the Gulf of Mexico spill , he asked : `` Why would we want to take that kind of risk ? '' \nMeanwhile , weather conditions have improved considerably , allowing some 3,000 personnel involved in the clean-up operation to get back to work , the BBC 's Andy Gallacher in Louisiana reports . \nHe adds that winds and tides are now forcing the oil slick towards the coast of Florida , where Governor Charlie Crist has added 13 more counties to the six that are already under state of emergency . \nThe slick may not come ashore for at least three days , according to a Coast Guard official . \nThe 40ft -LRB- 12m -RRB- funnel resembles a primitive space rocket with a hole on top to channel oil through a pipe from the sea floor to the surface where it can be collected on a barge , Reuters news agency reports . \nHOW THE OIL FUNNEL WORKS The funnel is a 40ft tall iron box , weighing 98 tonnes It will be placed over the leak , 5,000 ft down on the seabed BP hopes it will collect 85 % of the leaking oil and pipe it to the surface It is being built at Golden Meadow , near Port Fourchon in southern Louisiana , by Wild Well Control , a company that specialises in controlling oil fires . \nA team of 25 people is working around the clock on the funnel , marine engineer Jason Holvey told the agency . \nIn theory , the system should collect 85 % of the oil rising from the sea floor . \nWhile the precise location of the leak is known , work will have to be carried out in the face of severe technical challenges , not least because of the softness of the sea floor . \nAsked by Reuters if he was confident it would work , BP spokesman John Curry said : `` We sure hope so . \n`` If not , we will keep trying other options until something does work . \nI think we have some great engineers and they have worked very hard . '' \nThe funnel will have to be tested before it can be shipped to the spill site . \nA back-up funnel is also under construction , AP said . \nMr Holvey said similar containment devices had been used in the Gulf before , but in shallow waters . \nThey were used , for instance , after Hurricane Katrina to channel oil to the surface that had spilled from platforms . \nThe US government has been putting pressure on BP to act quickly . \nIn a BBC interview , Hayward dismissed talk of a rift between BP and US officials , saying an `` incredible co-operative relationship '' had been established with the federal authorities . \nThousands of barrels of oil have been leaking into the Gulf of Mexico every day since the rig sank . \nSome oil has washed ashore , but officials say the bulk of the slick remains a few miles from the Louisiana coastline . \nThe oil is already having a devastating effect on the area 's fishing industry , and officials fear much wider environmental damage if the full slick hits land . \nOther efforts being made by BP , according to Mr Hayward , include using undersea robots to work on the safety valve which failed , allowing the oil to escape , and drilling a new well to help relieve the pressure and stem the flow from the rupture . \nBP has said it will honor legitimate claims for compensation from people affected . \n"}

'' \nBut another study , carried out by Swedish researchers in 1981 , appears to contradict that view . \n`` The oil from the Ixtoc I blow-out acutely affected the species and ecosystems in the Campeche Bay area through its chemical toxicity -LRB- in the vicinity of the well -RRB- and through its physical properties -LRB- stickiness -RRB- in a larger area offshore and along the coast , '' that study says . \nBeyond the academic debate , locals are adamant that the most obvious evidence of Ixtoc 's legacy are the black , rock-like formations of solidified oil that can be found in parts of the Campeche coast . \nThose were not here before the Ixtoc spill , they say . \nMany in Mexico believe that the Ixtoc episode could not only provide clues to the possible effects of the BP oil slick , but also offer more immediate guidance . \nAt the time of the Ixtoc crisis , Carlos Osornio was the chief offshore drilling engineer for Pemex and was part of the team trying to contain the leak . \nFrom those moments of tension and uncertainty he has this advice for the engineers at BP . \n`` My recommendation would be to build two relief wells , '' he told the BBC . \n`` It is the only and final solution they have . '' \nNo doubt those efforts to stop the flow of oil will be followed closely by the residents of the Campeche coast . \nThey fear that a busy hurricane season and changing currents could push some of the oil leaking from the BP rig to their shores - bringing with it the painful memories of Ixtoc , 30 years on . \nYou can listen to Does Nature Recover , Rajesh Mirchandani 's report from Mexico , on World Service Radio at 1100GMT , or watch it on BBC World News at 1100GMT on Monday 14 June . \nThe pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ? \n"}

{"id": "412", "time": "2010-09-08", "text": "Firefighters battled in vain to save the rig The Deepwater Horizon rig disaster caused the deaths of 11 crew and a massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . \nSince the 20 April catastrophe there has been much discussion in US Congressional hearings and the media about the sequence of events that led up to it . \nHere is a summary of what we know so far about the BP oil spill , and the primary questions that are still being investigated . \nThe Deepwater Horizon rig was drilling an oil well in the Macondo prospect that was intended to be plugged with cement and then completed later to become a production well . \nThe top of the well was about 5,000 ft -LRB- 1,524 m -RRB- beneath the surface of the Gulf of Mexico . \nThe Deepwater Horizon was owned and mostly staffed by employees of exploration firm Transocean , under contract to BP . \nBOP : Blowout preventer - stack of valves designed to stop blowouts Blind ram shear : Last line of defense in BOP - cuts pipe Centraliser : Device to keep pipe or casing in center of well Cement bond log : Tests to make sure cement is sound Annulus : Gap between pipe and rock , or between pipe and another pipe Underwater oil wells are not just holes with a drilling pipe stuck into them . \nAs the drilling is done , a fluid , usually mud is forced out of the drill bit and debris is thus pushed upwards . \nThis fluid also counteracts the pressure to stop oil and gas forcing their way upwards . \nOnce each passage of drilling is completed , metal casing is cemented into place in the hole . \nIn this case the well had already been cemented ready for abandonment . \nAt the point the disaster occurred , the well was essentially finished . \nHow cement and casing is placed in drilling borehole Drill , lowered from rig , bores through seabed creating a borehole for sections of casing pipe to be lowered into Casing pipe is lowered into borehole allowing cement to be pumped down the pipe to fix it in place Once the cement is set and secure another stage of drilling begins In his evidence to a Congressional committee on 19 May , Transocean chief executive Steve Newman noted that the well was `` essentially complete '' with drilling having finished three days before the disaster on 17 April . \nHe said : `` The one thing we do know is that on the evening of 20 April , there was a sudden catastrophic failure of the casing , the cement or both . \nWithout a failure of one of those elements , the explosion could not have occurred . '' \nCementing issues being investigated by Transocean include the type of nitrogen-foamed cement used , the volume and the time it was allowed to `` cure '' . \nThe BP investigation released on 8 September said data from the fateful day suggested that oil and gas had passed through the cement at the bottom of the well , through a device known as a `` shoe track '' and up the casing . \nThe cement used was foamed with nitrogen . \nThe BP team criticised providers Halliburton for doing `` inadequate lab tests '' on the cement mix . \nMuch has been made in Congressional hearings of the number of centralisers used . \nThese devices make sure that the pipe or casing is centralised during cementing , to ensure a good job is done . \nCongressmen say Halliburton recommended that 21 should be used , but BP decided only six should be used . \nIn an e-mail , a BP engineer said : `` But , who cares , it 's done , end of story , will probably be fine and we 'll get a good cement job . '' \nThe BP investigation said the 15 centralisers were ready for use on the rig , but workers wrongly thought they were of a type that would have caused problems . \nThey decided not to use them . \nThis decision was wrong , but did not contribute to the disaster , the BP team said . \nBecause of the importance of getting a good cement job in the well , one that is bonded both to the casing and to the geological formation in which the well is dug , a series of measurements called a `` cement bond log '' is usually run . \nA sonic scanning device is lowered through the well on a wireline . \nIt checks whether there are imperfections in bonding or other problems in the cement . \nIf there are , more cement can be squeezed into affected sections . \nDocuments presented to Congress show a team from Schlumberger were called to the rig to be ready to do such work , but that they departed on the morning of the disaster having been told their services were not required . \nOther documents suggest the cost saving in not having a `` cement bond log '' to be about $ 118,000 . \n`` The cement bond log not being done at that point was n't a wrong choice , '' said BP investigation team leader Mark Bly . \nHe did say that there should have been a `` risk assessment '' that might have included a cement bond log , but emphasised that it might not have spotted any problems . \nAnother issue was the type of casing that would be used on the final , bottom section of the well . \nBP opted for a single line of casing from the seabed down to the bottom of the well , Congressman say . \nThe more expensive option would have been to use a `` liner '' , a bit of casing hung from the bottom of the casing section above . \nInside this would have been a further piece of tubing called a `` tieback '' . \nThis arrangement would have created more barriers to the upward flow of oil and gas , but it would also have been more expensive . \nThe BP team found that the suggestion that the firm used the wrong well design by not opting for a `` liner with tieback '' had no bearing on the disaster . \nThis option would have guarded against oil flowing up the annulus , the space between the casing and the geological formation . \nBut BP believes it went straight up the casing . \nBP 's investigation said it took 49 minutes after the first oil and gas flowed up the well before Transocean workers on the rig took action to control the situation . \nBy extension , this suggests that they did not notice until that point that there was a big problem . \n`` It is also clear that the drill crew had very little , if any , time to react . \nThe initial indications of trouble and the subsequent explosions were almost instantaneous . '' \nThe surge of gas that reached the surface ignited . \nTransocean identified two nearby vessels , the rig 's own engines and some equipment as the possible source of the accidental ignition . \nBP 's investigation was unable to ascertain the cause of ignition . \nBut their team did identify one crucial decision leading to the blast . \nA worker pressed a button to send the flow from the well to a device called a mud-gas separator , but the valves at various points in the system could n't deal with the pressure and failed . \nA cloud of gas was soon all over the ship . \nInstead , the gas and oil could have been sent overboard , but that still might not have stopped the gas igniting . \nThis meant the sensors were active but the alarm would not actually sound , to avoid the crew being awoken at night . \nTransocean said the setup was standard practice and there were in any case hundreds of other alarms . \nIn the blast and fire , 11 rig workers died , with more injured . \nJust over 36 hours later the rig sank . \nWhatever the exact cause of what happened , it is clear there was some sort of gas-kick and blowout resulting in an uncontrolled upward surge of oil and gas flow to the surface . \nThe blowout preventer -LRB- BOP -RRB- is supposed to stop this happening . \nThe BOP , the size of a five-storey building , consists of a series of high-pressure valves , designed to prevent such a surge or kick from damaging the drilling operation . \nIn this particular BOP , built by US firm Cameron to specifications by Transocean , there are five ram-type preventers and two annular preventers , according to Transocean 's chief executive . \nThe crew on the rig tried to close the BOP manually , but it failed . \nA `` dead man '' automatic trigger also failed . \nAnd subsequent attempts to close it using remote-operated vehicles did not work . \nInvestigations into the US oil spill are focused on the blowout preventer system of valves on the seabed . \nThe system 's control panel is its electronic `` brains '' , keeping valves open to allow flow from well to rig . \nIn an emergency , hydraulic valves or shear rams should close shut on the pipe , sealing it and preventing flow . \nBACK -LCB- current -RCB- of -LCB- total -RCB- NEXT Two possible scenarios have been discussed . \nOne - suggested by Transocean - is that the kick was so catastrophic it pushed fragments of cement debris through the BOP so fast that it was damaged and could not activate . \nThe sheer force of what happened is indicated by the fact that cement debris traveled all the way up the 5,000 ft of riser and on to the deck of the drilling rig . \nThe other possibility is that the BOP was faulty in the first place . \nThere were initial allegations that the batteries in a control pod for the BOP may have been flat . \nThe BP investigation team said that one of the control pods did indeed have insufficient charge to activate the BOP . \nAnd the other pod had a faulty electrical coil and also could not work . \nWorkers on the rig had tried to activate the BOP manually but cables from the surface had been damaged . \nThe last line of defense in a BOP is usually the blind shear ram . \nThis device , activated hydraulically , uses piston-driven blades to cut the pipe , thus stopping the flow . \nThis did not work . \nOne possible explanation that has been suggested is that the section of pipe it was trying to shear was a section of `` tool joint '' . \nThese joints between the pipes are typically so strong that a blind shear ram can not deal with them . \nThe BP probe said this was not the case . \nAnother possibility is that something in the hydraulic mechanism of the blind shear ram had failed . \nThe failed BOP was removed from the top of the damaged well on 2 September and brought to the surface two days later . \nIt is now in the custody of the Deepwater Horizon Criminal Investigation Team and FBI Evidence Recovery Team and will be examined to determine what went wrong . \nThe pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ? \n"}

'' \nIn a statement , BP said the filing `` does not in any manner constitute any finding of liability or any judicial finding that the allegations have merit '' . \nBP said it would continue to co-operate with government inquiries and fulfil its commitments to clean up spilt oil in the Gulf . \nHalliburton , the company that cemented the Macondo well , and Cameron International , which provided equipment for the well , were not targeted in the lawsuit . \nAndy Gallacher BBC News , Miami Barack Obama called the oil spill America 's environmental 9\\/11 . \nIt was a catastrophe on such a huge scale that he addressed the American people from the Oval Office for the first time in his presidency . \nDuring that address , he promised US citizens that they would not have to foot the bill for the clean-up and that those responsible would be brought to justice . \nIt was a militaristic speech that talked of battle plans and a greener future . \nIt also set the tone for an administration that was determined to make BP and others pay for this country 's biggest environmental disaster . \nThis lawsuit will be the start of a long road of litigation that could last for years and cost BP and others dearly . \nCriminal probes are still under way and there is the potential for thousands of class-action lawsuits . \nBut for many , who depend on the oil industry for their livelihood , there has long been a desire to put this accident behind them and get back to work . \nBut the justice department said on Wednesday that the investigation into the oil spill was ongoing and that more defendants and charges could be added to the lawsuit . \nMr Holder did not specify a timetable for legal proceedings , instead saying the US would move as quickly as possible in the matter . \nTransocean disputed the charges brought by the government , saying that it should not be held liable for the actions of others . \n`` No drilling contractor has ever been held liable for discharges from a well under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 , '' the company said in a statement . \n`` The responsibility for hydrocarbons discharged from a well lies solely with its owner and operator .
