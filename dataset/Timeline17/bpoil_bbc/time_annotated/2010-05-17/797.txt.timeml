US says BP move to curb oil leak ` no solution ' A boom is erected in Louisiana to counter the spill
The success of a move by oil giant BP to curb a leak in the Gulf of Mexico is ` ` not clear '' and the technique provides ` ` no solution '' , the US has said .
It was responding to BP 's move to siphon oil from the leaking well head to a tanker on the surface .
A government statement said it would not rest until the leak was permanently sealed and the spill cleaned up .
BP executive Kent Wells earlier said that the siphoning process was ` ` working extremely well '' .
This was the third attempt it had made to insert a long narrow tube into the leaking pipe , using underwater robots .
It is thought that BP 's 6in - wide -LRB- 15 cm -RRB- tube and stopper could capture more than three - quarters of the leak , although a smaller spill nearby also has to be contained .
Mr Wells said on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2010-05-16">Sunday</TIMEX3> at the firm 's US headquarters in Houston , Texas , that <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="PXD" mod="MORE_THAN">over the next few days</TIMEX3> the company planned to slowly increase the amount of oil and gas flowing through the pipe to the tanker .
But a joint statement by Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano and Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar said the latest technique was ` ` not a solution to the problem and it is not yet clear how successful it may be '' .
The US government 's aggression against BP has n't lessened ...
I wonder whether the assault makes other big companies nervous It added : ` ` We will not rest until BP permanently seals the well head , the spill is cleaned up , and the communities and natural resources of the Gulf Coast are restored and made whole . ''
It was the second strong statement to BP by the government officials on the <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> crisis .
Earlier they sent a letter saying they wanted to be sure BP would honor commitments not to limit costs to a US statutory cap of $ 75 m -LRB- # 50 m -RRB- .
BP responded by saying it had already made clear its position on paying damages for the disaster .
It said <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-W19">last week</TIMEX3> the cap was irrelevant and it would settle all legitimate damages claims .
` ` What they are requesting in the letter is absolutely consistent with all our public statements on the matter , '' said BP spokesman David Nicholas on <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010-05-16">Sunday</TIMEX3> .
Earlier , scientists said they had found vast underwater plumes of oil , one 10 miles -LRB- 16 km -RRB- long and a mile wide .
Researchers from the National Institute for Undersea Science and Technology said they had detected the slicks lurking just beneath the surface of the sea and at depths of 4,000 ft -LRB- 1,200 m -RRB- .
Samantha Joye , a marine science professor at the University of Georgia , said : ` ` It could take years , possibly decades , for the system to recover from an infusion of this quantity of oil and gas .
` ` We ' ve never seen anything like this before .
It 's impossible to fathom the impact . ''
Chemical dispersants BP has been dumping underwater may be preventing the oil from rising to the top of the ocean , the scientists said .
The find suggests the scale of the potential environmental disaster is much worse than previously feared since the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig blew up on <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">20 April</TIMEX3> , killing 11 workers .
Some scientists cast doubt on BP 's estimate of the oil flow rate , saying the widely repeated figure of 5,000 barrels per day dramatically understates the real amount .
<TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="P1W">A week</TIMEX3> ago , BP tried to cap the well with a 100 - tonne box , but gave up after it became encrusted with ice crystals .
Mississippi has become the third US state to have traces of oil wash up on its coast , along with Louisiana and Alabama .
The spill is threatening to eclipse the <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="1989">1989</TIMEX3> Exxon Valdez leak off Alaska as America 's worst environmental disaster .
