Many in the tourism , fishing and other industries feared the region would never recover .
But Galicia has been regenerated in the eight intervening years , to such an extent that it is almost as if the accident never happened .
It is hoped Galicia 's story could provide inspiration for those in the Gulf of Mexico who are pessimistic that they will ever recover from the massive BP oil spill .
