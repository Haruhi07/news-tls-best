BP shares have risen sharply on speculation it may have buyers lined up for possible asset sales .
The UK oil firm is thought to be planning the sell - offs in order to fund cost of the Gulf of Mexico clean - up , which has <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> reached $ 3.5 bn -LRB- # 2.3 bn -RRB- .
BP shares closed up 9.5 % at 399.4 p on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010-07-12">Monday</TIMEX3> .
That is more than 30 % higher than the low hit on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2011-06-25">25 June</TIMEX3> , but 40 % off its pre - spill peak .
Among the rumored buyers are PetroChina and US oil firm Apache Corp. .

Speculation also continues that BP may become the target of a takeover - either friendly or hostile .
ExxonMobil is known to be eyeing its crisis - hit rival , as well as other oil majors such as Chevron , although any buyout would need approval from competition authorities in the US and , most critically , Europe .
BP chief executive Tony Hayward has also been soliciting friendly investments from sovereign wealth funds in the Middle East and elsewhere , with Kuwait among the longstanding shareholders .
Markets were also encouraged by faster progress by BP in dealing with the oil spill .
The company is preparing to fit a replacement cap over the leaking pipe on the ocean floor , which it hopes will be tighter than the <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> cap and will capture all of the oil flow .
Meanwhile , the drilling of two relief wells - which will be used to cut off the oil flow altogether - is on schedule , and expected to be completed in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2009-08" mod="START">early August</TIMEX3> .
The pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ?
