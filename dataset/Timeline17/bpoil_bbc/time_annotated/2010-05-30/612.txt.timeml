There is increasing anger in local communities at the failures The Gulf of Mexico oil spill is the worst environmental disaster the US has faced , a senior official has said .
White House energy adviser Carol Browner also said the US was ` ` prepared for the worst scenario '' that the leak might not be stopped before <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2009-08">August</TIMEX3> .
BP is to try a new tactic after its latest failure to halt the leak , but says there is no guarantee of success .
BP chief operating officer Doug Suttles said even if it worked it would only halt a majority of the spill .
At least 20 million gallons have <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> spilled into the Gulf of Mexico , affecting more than 70 miles -LRB- 110 km -RRB- of Louisiana 's coastline .
Eleven rig workers died when the Deepwater Horizon exploded and sank <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-W15" mod="APPROX">nearly six weeks ago</TIMEX3> .
Ms Browner , talking on NBC 's Meet The Press , said : ` ` More oil is leaking in the Gulf of Mexico than at any other time in our history .
It means there is more oil than the Exxon Valdez -LRB- in Alaska in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="1989">1989</TIMEX3> -RRB- . ''
Carol Browner on ` the biggest eco - disaster ever ' , on NBC 's Meet the Press She said she hoped the latest plan would work but admitted it would be a temporary measure and that a relief well <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> being drilled might turn out to be the permanent solution .
However , that will not be ready for <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P2M" mod="EQUAL_OR_MORE">at least two months</TIMEX3> .
Ms Browner said BP had been told to drill another relief well in case the first did not work .
In the meantime , BP is setting up its Lower Marine Riser Package -LRB- LMRP -RRB- to stem the flow .
It will use undersea robots to slice through the damaged pipe to make a clean cut that can be connected to another pipe , capturing the leaking oil .
The plan will take <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P4D">four days</TIMEX3> to set up .
However , BP said the operation had never been carried out at a depth of 5,000 ft and ` ` the successful deployment of the containment system can not be assured '' .
The White House said the president had been informed that the flow rate could increase by as much as 20 % until the containment device was applied over the leak .
University of Alabama engineering professor Philip W Johnson told Associated Press news agency that although he was hopeful the plan would succeed , if the new cap could not be placed on the fresh cut , ` ` things will get much worse '' .
The system is similar to a previous containment dome plan that failed .
Speaking on US television on <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010-05-30">Sunday</TIMEX3> , BP managing director Robert Dudley vowed the company would learn from its failed attempts and continue trying .
Oil booms - partly successful Dispersant used - scientists warn it may kill marine life Huge dome placed over leak - became blocked by ice crystals Mile - long tube - fails to suck up large amount of oil ` ` Top - kill '' method to pump heavy mud - abandoned
He said the company would know by the end of the week if the latest attempt had succeeded .
Mr Suttles earlier admitted its ` ` top kill '' operation to blast waste material and heavy mud into the ruptured well had failed .
` ` We have been unable to overcome the flow from the well , so we <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> believe it 's time to move on to the next of our options , '' he said .
Mr Suttles said he ` ` did not know for certain '' why it had failed .
Meanwhile at least 12,000 barrels -LRB- 504,000 gallons -RRB- are leaking into the Gulf <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EVERY">every day</TIMEX3> .
BP has spent more than $ 940 m -LRB- # 645 m -RRB- so far in trying to contain the disaster .
President Obama earlier expressed anger at the latest failure .
` ` It is as enraging as it is heartbreaking , and we will not relent until this leak is contained , until the waters and shores are cleaned up , and until the people unjustly victimised by this man - made disaster are made whole , '' he said .
Mr Obama toured the oil - hit areas on <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2010-05-28">Friday</TIMEX3> and said he would triple the manpower to contain and clean up the spill .
The pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ?
