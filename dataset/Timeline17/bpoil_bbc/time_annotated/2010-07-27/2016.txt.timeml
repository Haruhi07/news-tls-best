Greenpeace said it wanted the company to adopt greener policies BP filling stations across London have been shut down by activists .
Environmental group Greenpeace said it had cut fuel supplies to all 50 BP stations in the city .
The oil firm said 35 to 40 had been shut but many of them have <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> reopened .
The protesters stopped the fuel by removing safety switches on forecourts .
The action comes as BP reported an # 11bn loss after the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and confirmed chief executive Tony Hayward is to step down .
Greenpeace said it wanted the company to adopt greener energy policies .
A BP spokeswoman said a majority of the targeted fuel stations have reopened and the rest will resume normal service by the evening .
Greenpeace said the safety switches will be returned .
The action was described by BP as ` ` an irresponsible and childish act which is interfering with safety systems '' .
Greenpeace said the protest was being held to urge Bob Dudley , who will take over from Mr Hayward from <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-10">October</TIMEX3> , to move away from ` ` his predecessor 's obsession with high - risk , environmentally - reckless sources of oil '' .
At one station in Camden , north London , Greenpeace climbers replaced BP 's logo with a new version showing the green ` ` sunflower '' disappearing into a sea of oil .
At others , protesters put up signs saying : ` ` Closed .
Moving beyond petroleum . ''
The organization 's executive director John Sauven said : ` ` The moment has come for BP to move beyond oil . ''
A spokesman for the Metropolitan police said they were monitoring the situation but no crime had been reported and no arrests had been made so far .
The action follows the worst oil spill in US history , triggered by an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig off Louisiana in the Gulf of Mexico on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">20 April</TIMEX3> .
BP placed a containment cap on the well <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010-W29">last week</TIMEX3> , stopping the flow for the first time since <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-04">April</TIMEX3> .
The pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ?
