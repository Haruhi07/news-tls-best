The BBC 's Andy Gallacher explains BP 's new plan BP has delayed a key test on a newly installed well cap aimed at stopping the flow of oil in the Gulf of Mexico .
BP and US Coast Guard officials said further analysis was needed before pressure testing could begin .
If it proves successful , the well will be kept ` ` shut in '' and the leak halted until relief wells plug it entirely .
The blown - out well has been spewing oil into Gulf waters since <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2010-04">April</TIMEX3> .
The US administration has sent BP and other parties a new bill for the clean - up .
The administration says the latest bill is for $ 99.7 m -LRB- # 65.8 m -RRB- .
The oil giant has already fully paid the last three bills totalling $ 122.2 m -LRB- # 80.6 m -RRB- for costs related to response and clean - up of the spill , according to the Obama administration .
The test in the Gulf of Mexico , which was supposed to begin on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-07-13">Tuesday</TIMEX3> , will determine whether BP 's new cap can contain the oil .
Coast Guard chief Admiral Thad Allen said the extra analysis would continue into <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-07-14">Wednesday</TIMEX3> .
This latest move to stop the oil comes <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> after the containment cap was placed on the leaking well .
The sealing cap system never before has been deployed at these depths or under these conditions '' Work on the permanent relief well solution continues .
BP Vice - President Kent Wells said no promises could be made about whether the new cap would work .
` ` It 's not simple stuff .
What we do n't want to do is speculate around it , '' he said .
Shutting in the well would provide a temporary solution to the leaking oil .
BP is continuing work on the relief well that is expected permanently to stop the oil .
If the test goes as planned , it will mark the first time since the explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">20 April</TIMEX3> that the leaking oil has been stopped .
During the tests , BP will be monitoring the pressure of the oil in the well .
High pressure will mean the oil has been contained inside the wellhead .
But if the tests showed there was low pressure , Mr Wells said , this might indicate that oil was leaking elsewhere in the well .
He added that if pressure was low the cap would not be kept shut and ships on the surface of the Gulf would continue collecting oil .
NEW CAP FOR LEAKING
OIL WELL
In <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010-06">June</TIMEX3> , BP placed a cap , known as an LMRP cap , over the top of the Deepwater Horizon well so oil could be collected at the surface .
However , this continued to leak oil and has <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> been replaced with a better fitting device .
NEW CAP FOR LEAKING OIL
WELL When engineers removed the LMRP cap on <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2010-07-10">10 July</TIMEX3> , oil began to freely flow from the top of the blowout preventer once more .
However , the Q4000 containment system continued to take some oil to the surface .
NEW CAP FOR LEAKING OIL
WELL Engineers then bolted on a new capping stack onto the blowout preventer
-LRB- BOP -RRB- .
This allowed them to conduct a series of tests to see if the flow of oil could be stopped using the newly installed equipment .

During the test the three ram capping stack has been closed and all sub - sea containment systems collecting the oil temporarily suspended , effectively blocking the flow of oil from the well .
NEW CAP FOR LEAKING OIL
WELL
Once the tests have been successfully completed , BP will resume collecting oil .
The Helix Producer ship was <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> connected to the BOP to provide another collection route in addition to the Q4000 rig .
BACK -LCB- <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> -RCB- of -LCB- total -RCB- NEXT The testing will involve closing three separate valves that tightly fit together , stopping the oil from entering the Gulf .
BP expects no oil will be released from the well during the test process , but the company remains cautious .
` ` The sealing cap system never before has been deployed at these depths or under these conditions , and its efficiency and ability to contain the oil and gas can not be assured , '' it said in a statement .
If the cap is unable to take the pressure , a pipe will be connected to the cap to take oil to the ships .
Whatever happens , the well will still need to be plugged , which BP says may not happen until mid - <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2010-08">August</TIMEX3> .
The first of two relief wells has another 30 ft -LRB- 9 m -RRB- to drill before intercepting the leaking well , Mr Wells said .
He expects BP to complete the drilling by <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2010-07" mod="END">late July</TIMEX3> .
BP will then attempt to plug the blown - out well with mud and cement .
By <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2010-07-12">Monday</TIMEX3> , between 89 m gallons -LRB- 337 m litres -RRB- and 176 m gallons of oil had leaked into the Gulf , according to government estimates .
US President Barack Obama has labeled the oil spill the country 's worst - ever environmental disaster .
BP says it has spent $ 3.5 bn -LRB- # 2.3 bn -RRB- on the response effort so far .
The pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ?
