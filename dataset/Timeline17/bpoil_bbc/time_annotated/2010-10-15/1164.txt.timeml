Kenneth Feinberg oversaw compensation for victims of <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2001-09-11">the 11 September , 2001</TIMEX3> attacks
The administrator of a $ 20bn -LRB- # 12.5 bn -RRB- fund to compensate victims of the BP oil spill has said there is ` ` no doubt '' that fraudulent claims are an issue .
Kenneth Feinberg pledged to be vigilant over who received payments to protect the integrity of the fund .
About $ 1.3 bn has already been paid out in emergency payments .
There have been about 160,000 applications for compensation , Mr Feinberg told the BBC - about half filed in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P2W">the last two weeks</TIMEX3> .
` ` That 's some indication that citizens think that the program is available to generously pay them , '' Mr Feinberg said .
` ` There 's no doubt that fraud is hovering all the time over a program like this . ''
But he pledged each application would be carefully examined , saying , ` ` nothing would undercut the credibility of this fund more than fraud and the payment of ineligible claims . ''
The fund is to reimburse Gulf of Mexico residents and businesses for lost wages and profits and for personal injuries and clean - up , among other claims .
Those seeking compensation in return must give up their right to sue BP .
The oil spill , which began <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">20 April</TIMEX3> with the explosion of the BP - leased Deepwater Horizon drilling rig , caused widespread disruption along the US Gulf Coast .
An estimated 206 million gallons of oil flowed into the Gulf before BP capped the well in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-08">August</TIMEX3> .
The Gulf Coast Claims Facility , as the claims program is known , was set up in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2010-06">June</TIMEX3> amid fears BP would fail to heed President Barack Obama 's demand that it reimburse Gulf Coast residents for their losses .
The fund requires claimants to document their losses in their applications for compensation .

But Mr Feinberg , who oversaw compensation for victims of <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2001-09-11">the 11 September 2001</TIMEX3> attacks , said that about 5,000 claims had been made with no documentation at all .
The pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ?
