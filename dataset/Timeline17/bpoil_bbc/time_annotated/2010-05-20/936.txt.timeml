Greenpeace campaigners unfurled a protest banner at BP 's headquarters BP has said more oil than the 5,000 barrels <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> it initially estimated is flowing from a burst oil well into the Gulf of Mexico .
The energy giant said a long tube it inserted into the gusher at <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-W19-WE">the weekend</TIMEX3> was <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> siphoning 5,000 barrels <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> , but that more was escaping .
Meanwhile , US officials have ordered BP to use a less toxic chemical to disperse the crude .
The spill has reached Louisiana and is <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> threatening Florida and Cuba .
Oil has been gushing since the offshore drilling rig Deepwater Horizon , leased by BP , exploded off the coast of Louisiana on <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">20 April</TIMEX3> and sank <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010-04-22">two days later</TIMEX3> .
BP had stuck by its first estimate that some 5,000 barrels , or 210,000 gallons , <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> of crude was leaking from the well - despite claims from several experts that the figure was at least 10 times higher .
But BP spokesman Mark Proegler told news agency AFP on <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2010-05-20">Thursday</TIMEX3> : ` ` <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> that we are collecting 5,000 barrels <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> , it might be a little more than that . ''
A live video feed that shows the oil gushing from the well has been made available by BP after pressure from a US congressman .
It shows a large , flowing plume of oil and gas next to the tube that is carrying some of it to the surface .
Mr Proegler continued : ` ` We said from the beginning , our experts have been saying there really is no reliable way to estimate the flow from the riser . ''
The oil firm 's temporary solution has been to funnel the oil up to a ship , but on <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2010-05-16">Sunday</TIMEX3> it is preparing its latest attempt to seal the rupture .
Engineers are planning a so - called ` ` top kill '' operation , in which heavy mud would be injected to stem the oil flow , then cement used to block the well permanently .
The procedure has worked before to stop oil gushing above ground , but like other methods BP is exploring , it has never been used a mile below the sea , where the well is located .
The US Environmental Protection Agency -LRB- EPA -RRB- has told BP to use a new dispersant to contain the oil spill , as fears grow about potential damage from the use of such chemicals .
BP has used a number of dispersants , all approved by the EPA , to try to break up the crude .
Outrage from environmentalists over the ballooning slick - which is visible from space - has been mounting .
Greenpeace campaigners scaled the London headquarters of BP on <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2010-05-20">Thursday</TIMEX3> and unfurled a flag with BP 's logo and the words ` ` British Polluters '' .
An ocean <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> is threatening to carry the oil into the Atlantic It emerged on <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2010-05-19">Wednesday</TIMEX3> a small portion of the slick had entered the so - called Loop <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Current</TIMEX3> , which could take it to Florida and up the eastern US coast .
Florida 's state meteorologist said it would be <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DURATION" value="P1W" mod="EQUAL_OR_MORE">at least a week</TIMEX3> before the oil reached waters near the state .
Farther south , US officials have been talking to Cuba about how to respond should the spill reach the island 's northern coast , said a US state department spokesman .
