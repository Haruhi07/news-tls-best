The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has so far cost BP a total of $ 3.12 bn -LRB- # 2bn
-RRB- , the company has said .
The total includes the cost of containing the spill and cleaning up the oil , and the cost of drilling relief wells .
It also includes the $ 147 m paid out in compensation to some of those affected by the spill .
But BP again warned that the total cost of the spill is likely to be much higher .
The cost is already significantly higher than the $ 2.65 bn cost reported <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-W26">a week ago</TIMEX3> .
BP said there were <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> 44,500 people working on the spill response - nearly 5,000 <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010-W26" mod="MORE_THAN">more than a week ago</TIMEX3> .
But the company also confirmed that efforts to collect oil from the surface of the water had been temporarily placed on hold due to Hurricane Alex , which is <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> passing through the region .
Oil is continuing to leak into the Gulf of Mexico following the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2011-04">April</TIMEX3> .
BP said two relief wells being drilled to stop the leak are still on course for completion by <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2010-08">August</TIMEX3> .
Shares in BP rose more than 2 % at the beginning of trading in London .
They remain at around half their value before the disaster , however .
Investors remain uncertain over the eventual financial impact of the oil disaster , with estimates from analysts putting the final bill in the tens of billions .
Meanwhile the collapse in the share price has lead to speculation that BP may become a takeover target .
<TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2010-W26">Last week</TIMEX3> investment bank JP Morgan Cazenove suggested oil giant Exxon Mobil as a possible buyer , while Anglo - Dutch oil giant Shell has also been mentioned .
But analysts also suggest a potential role for state - backed oil companies such as China 's PetroChina or Kuwait Oil .
Media reports in the United Arab Emirates also indicate that Middle Eastern investors are considering buying stakes in BP .
The National newspaper , which is owned by the Abu Dhabi government , cited ` ` informed sources '' saying that ` ` BP knows there is potential support from the Middle East '' .
A BP spokeswoman refused to comment directly on the reports .
` ` We welcome new shareholders and existing shareholders increasing their holding , but there are no <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> plans to issue new equity , '' she said .
