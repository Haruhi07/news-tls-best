Inmates could help oil clean - up Criticism of BP is mounting in the US over its handling of the huge oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano urged BP to commit more resources to tackling the catastrophe .
Critics of the British oil giant also include President Barack Obama , who is due to travel to the region on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2010-04-25">Sunday</TIMEX3> to assess efforts to contain the spill .
The sprawling oil slick has begun washing up on the Louisiana coast and is threatening three other states .
Up to 5,000 barrels of oil <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> are gushing into the sea after the BP - operated Deepwater Horizon rig exploded and sank <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-W16">last week</TIMEX3> .
BP 's chief executive Tony Hayward is flying to Louisiana later to personally oversee the emergency mop - up operation .
Two natural gas platforms in the Gulf of Mexico had halted production because of the slick and one of them had been evacuated as a safety precaution , the command center co - ordinating the response said .
It said the gas production affected represented less than one - tenth of one per cent of the Gulf of Mexico 's daily total .
Analysts say the spill could rival the <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="1989">1989</TIMEX3> Exxon Valdez disaster as the worst in US history .
Mississippi , Alabama , Louisiana and Florida have all declared a state of emergency .
Animal rescue groups have been receiving their first patients - seabirds coated in oil .
Worsening weather conditions have been hampering efforts to contain the slick , <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> more than 130 miles -LRB- 200 km -RRB- long .

A BBC correspondent in the area says that at the moment the wind is keeping most of the oil offshore .

But the choppy seas mean that smaller boats that could help clean up the slick are unable to go out .
Forecasters also warned that strong winds over <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-04-25">Sunday</TIMEX3> could push the oil into inlets , ponds and lakes in south - east Louisiana .
The homeland security secretary flew into Louisiana on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-04-30">Friday</TIMEX3> to deliver a stark message to BP , which had been leasing the rig .
` ` We continue to urge BP to leverage additional assets to help lead the response in this effort , '' said Ms Napolitano .
After several unsuccessful attempts to plug the leak , she said , it was ` ` time for BP to supplement their <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> mobilisation '' .
By Joe Lynam , BBC business correspondent BP 's shareholders would probably prefer <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="PXY">a few years</TIMEX3> out of the limelight after a five - year period in which the firm 's reputation has been blown about .
The fire at a Texas City refinery , the leak of an Alaskan gas pipeline and the sudden departure of former boss Lord Browne , have all been PR disasters .
But this Gulf of Mexico leak may surpass all of them .
Apart from the environmental catastrophe , # 10bn -LRB- $ 15bn
-RRB- was wiped off the value of Britain 's third - largest company <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2010-W17">this week</TIMEX3> .
And <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> we learn that BP is not even covered by any external insurance and will have to meet compensation claims from its own resources - at a cost of billions of dollars .

And that does not even put a price on the damage to the reputation of a company which describes itself as ` ` Beyond Petroleum '' .
Some 1,900 emergency workers and more than 300 ships and aircraft are being sent to the disaster zone , President Barack Obama has announced .
In a White House statement , he said BP was ` ` ultimately responsible ... for paying the costs of response and clean - up operations '' .
Correspondents says the White House is desperate to avoid the kind of disaster that Hurricane Katrina brought to the region in <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2005">2005</TIMEX3> .
The president said he had asked Interior Secretary Ken Salazar to conduct a ` ` thorough review '' of the catastrophe and report back in <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DURATION" value="P30D">30 days</TIMEX3> on ways to prevent a repeat .
As the first strands of the slick reached the coast , Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal said the oil firm did not seem prepared for the clean - up job .
` ` I do have concerns that BP 's resources are not adequate , '' he said .
The first lawsuits have already been filed on behalf of fisherman , in what could end up as a barrage of litigation .
BP spokeswoman Sheila Williams told AFP news agency the energy firm was prepared to assume costs for the clean - up and for damages .
The BBC 's business correspondent , Joe Lynam , says that BP has no external insurance cover in the traditional sense , instead using a form of ` ` self insurance '' to cover major events like this .
The company would therefore have to cover the full cost of any legitimate compensation claims from the oil spill from its own resources , our correspondent says .
The oil giant 's chief operating officer , Doug Suttles , said it had mounted ` ` the largest response effort ever done in the world '' .
BP says it has begun using dispersants underwater in an attempt to break up the leaking oil at its source .
The oil giant has also dispatched remotely operated vehicles to try to shut off an underwater valve , so far without success .
The firm is also having a relief - well drilled to slow the leak , though experts say that could take <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DURATION" value="P3M" mod="EQUAL_OR_LESS">up to three months</TIMEX3> .
US Air Force planes have been deployed to spray oil - dispersing chemicals off the coast of Louisiana .
The US Navy and Louisiana National Guard have also been mobilised .
Fishermen - who face losing their livelihood from the spill - have been drafted in to help .
Wetlands off the Louisiana coast sustain hundreds of wildlife species and a major seafood and fishing industry .
The cause of <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2010-W16">last week</TIMEX3> 's blast , which left 11 workers missing , presumed dead , remains unclear .
It has emerged that BP <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2009">last year</TIMEX3> downplayed the possibility of such a disaster at the offshore rig .
In BP 's <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3> exploration plan for the well , the firm suggested an oil spill was unlikely or virtually impossible , AP news agency reports .
The US government said on <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2010-04-30">Friday</TIMEX3> it was putting on hold all new offshore drilling until the cause of the spill is investigated .
<TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2010-04">Last month</TIMEX3> , President Obama eased a moratorium on new offshore drilling .
