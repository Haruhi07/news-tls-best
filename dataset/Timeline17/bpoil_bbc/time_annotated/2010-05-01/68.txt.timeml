Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal warned the spill threatened their way of life Bad weather hampered efforts to tackle the huge Gulf of Mexico oil slick , with high seas and winds keeping boats and planes away from the clean - up site .
Reports suggest that the slick is growing rapidly - one report said it had tripled in size in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> .
Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal warned that the spillage threatened the very way of life of people in his state .
President Obama is due there on <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-04-25">Sunday</TIMEX3> as is BP head Tony Hayward , who has been criticised over the BP response .
Sheen from the spill has begun washing up on the Louisiana coast , fuelling fears of environmental disaster .
Up to 5,000 barrels of oil <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> are gushing into the sea after the British Petroleum - operated Deepwater Horizon rig exploded and sank <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-W16">last week</TIMEX3> .
Mississippi , Alabama , Louisiana and Florida have all declared a state of emergency , and analysts say the spill could rival the <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="1989">1989</TIMEX3> Exxon Valdez disaster as the worst in US history .
Mr Jindal said on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-05-01">Saturday</TIMEX3> : ` ` This is n't just about our coast .
It 's about our way of life in Louisiana : our shrimpers , our fishermen , our coast that makes Louisiana a sportsman 's paradise . ''
As pressure mounted on BP , the governor continued : ` ` We certainly have passed the point of waiting for clean - up plans from BP or the incident commander . ''
The state had started developing ` ` contingency plans '' , he added .
Worsening weather conditions have been hampering efforts to contain the slick , <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> more than 130 miles -LRB- 200 km -RRB- long .
Military planes deployed to spray oil - dispersing chemicals have also been grounded .
Rescue groups have been receiving their first patients - seabirds coated in oil - but a BBC correspondent in the area says that at the moment the wind is keeping most of the oil offshore .
The high winds are also forcing some of it over booms meant to contain it , however , and forecasters say that strong winds on <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-04-25">Sunday</TIMEX3> could push more oil onto the Louisiana shore .
Wetlands off the Louisiana coast sustain hundreds of wildlife species , and a major seafood and fishing industry .
The president of Louisiana 's Plaquemines Parish area , Bill Nungesser , said that the oil could cause enormous damage .
` ` We need to have something out there , '' he said .
` ` Once it gets into the marsh it is too late .
Once it gets behind these islands , through these little canals , you will never clean it up . ''
Reports suggest that the slick is growing rapidly .
Experts from the University of Miami said that the slick had tripled in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> , citing satellite images .
Two natural gas platforms in the Gulf of Mexico have halted production because of the spill and one of them has been evacuated as a safety precaution .
The command center co - ordinating the response said that the percentage of gas production affected was less than one - tenth of one per cent of the Gulf of Mexico 's daily total .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2010-04-30">Friday</TIMEX3> , Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano called on BP to commit more resources to tackling the catastrophe .
By Joe Lynam , BBC business correspondent BP 's shareholders would probably prefer <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="PXY">a few years</TIMEX3> out of the limelight after a five - year period in which the firm 's reputation has been blown about .
The fire at a Texas City refinery , the leak of an Alaskan gas pipeline and the sudden departure of former boss Lord Browne , have all been PR disasters .
But this Gulf of Mexico leak may surpass all of them .
Apart from the environmental catastrophe , # 10bn -LRB- $ 15bn
-RRB- was wiped off the value of Britain 's third - largest company <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2010-W17">this week</TIMEX3> .
And <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> we learn that BP is not even covered by any external insurance and will have to meet compensation claims from its own resources - at a cost of billions of dollars .

And that does not even put a price on the damage to the reputation of a company which describes itself as ` ` Beyond Petroleum '' .
The British oil giant says it has begun using dispersants underwater in an attempt to break up the leaking oil at its source .
It has dispatched remotely operated vehicles to try to shut off an underwater valve , so far without success .
It is also having a relief - well drilled to slow the leak , though experts say that could take <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DURATION" value="P3M" mod="EQUAL_OR_LESS">up to three months</TIMEX3> .
In a statement , Mr Obama said BP was ` ` ultimately responsible ... for paying the costs of response and clean - up operations '' .
The president said he had asked Interior Secretary Ken Salazar to conduct a ` ` thorough review '' of the catastrophe and report back in <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DURATION" value="P30D">30 days</TIMEX3> on ways to prevent a repeat .
BP spokeswoman Sheila William told AFP news agency the energy firm was prepared to assume costs for the clean - up and for damages .
BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam says that BP has no external insurance cover in the traditional sense , instead using a form of ` ` self insurance '' to cover major events like this .
The company would therefore have to cover the full cost of any legitimate compensation claims from the oil spill from its own resources .
The cause of <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2010-W16">last week</TIMEX3> 's blast , which left 11 workers missing , presumed dead , remains unclear .

But it has emerged that BP <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2009">last year</TIMEX3> downplayed the possibility of such a disaster at the offshore rig .
In BP 's <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3> exploration plan for the well , the firm suggested an oil spill was unlikely or virtually impossible , AP news agency reports .
