President Obama : ` ` This is good news ''
BP says it is encouraged by the first test data following its stoppage of the oil from its leaking Gulf of Mexico well .
President Obama gave a cautious welcome but added : ` ` It is important we do n't get ahead of ourselves . ''
Pressure within the well is steadily rising , a good sign , said Kent Wells , BP 's vice president .
The oil has been stopped for the first time since <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">20 April</TIMEX3> , as part of a 48 - hour test .
Spilled oil has damaged hundreds of miles of Gulf coastline since <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-04">April</TIMEX3> , with serious economic damage to the region .
BP has already paid out more than $ 200 m -LRB- # 130 m -RRB- in claims to 32,000 claimants .
A further 17,000 claims are being evaluated for payment , and more information is being sought on 61,000 other claims .
On the sea floor there is <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> no evidence of the well rupturing .
Eleven workers were killed in the Deepwater Horizon explosion , and the oil spill has raised fears of an environmental catastrophe .
The flow of oil was shut off at <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="1425">1425</TIMEX3> local time -LRB- <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="TIME" value="2010-04-20T19:25">1925 GMT</TIMEX3> -RRB- on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-07-15">Thursday</TIMEX3> .
The stoppage is part of a test of the integrity of the well .
When the oil stops gushing , everybody feels like we 're done - and we 're not '' End
Quote Barack Obama US president
If the pressure within the new cap on the well stays high , that could mean there are no other leaks or ruptures within the wellbore .
If it drops , that could suggest problems .
` ` The new cap is good news , '' Mr Obama said , noting that it would either mean the oil was stopped or that almost all of it would be able to be captured .
But he added : ` ` One of the problems with having this camera down there is , is that when the oil stops gushing , everybody feels like we 're done - and we 're not . ''
The pressure within the well is <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> 6,700 pounds per square inch -LRB- psi -RRB- and steadily rising , said Mr Wells .
If it were to drop below 6,000 psi that would probably mean there was a problem within the well .
If it continues rising and stays over 8,000 psi that would probably mean the well was intact , Mr Wells said .
There is <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> ` ` no negative evidence of any breaching '' of the sea floor , Mr Wells said .
BP will soon run another seismic survey to check for any evidence of ruptures .
NEW CAP FOR LEAKING
OIL WELL
In <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2010-06">June</TIMEX3> , BP placed a cap , known as an LMRP cap , over the top of the Deepwater Horizon well so oil could be collected at the surface .
However , this continued to leak oil and has <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> been replaced with a better fitting device .
NEW CAP FOR LEAKING OIL
WELL When engineers removed the LMRP cap on <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2010-07-10">10 July</TIMEX3> , oil began to freely flow from the top of the blowout preventer once more .
However , the Q4000 containment system continued to take some oil to the surface .
NEW CAP FOR LEAKING OIL
WELL Engineers then bolted on a new capping stack onto the blowout preventer
-LRB- BOP -RRB- .
This allowed them to conduct a series of tests to see if the flow of oil could be stopped using the newly installed equipment .

During the test the three ram capping stack has been closed and all sub - sea containment systems collecting the oil temporarily suspended , effectively blocking the flow of oil from the well .

Once the tests have been successfully completed , BP will resume collecting oil .
The Helix Producer ship was <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> connected to the BOP to provide another collection route in addition to the Q4000 rig .
BACK -LCB- <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> -RCB- of -LCB- total -RCB- NEXT BP is also resuming work on a relief well that has 30 ft left to drill before it hits the original leaking well .
Once the wells intersect , mud and cement will be used to permanently deal with the leak .
The <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> pressure test could last for <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DURATION" value="P2D" mod="EQUAL_OR_LESS">up to 48 hours</TIMEX3> , with BP and government experts reviewing results every <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="PT6H">six hours</TIMEX3> .
If the test is successful it is not clear what will happen next .
BP has suggested it might be possible to keep the well shut , with oil collection vessels left on standby .
But government incident commander Thad Allen has suggested the most likely outcome is the resumption of collection of the oil with four vessels and the capacity to collect 80,000 barrels - all or virtually all of the oil - <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EACH">each day</TIMEX3> .
