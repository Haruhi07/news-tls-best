The dome will be lowered 5,000 ft -LRB- 1,500 m -RRB- under water to funnel leaking oil to the surface BP has managed to seal the smallest of the three leaks spilling oil into the Gulf of Mexico , the company says .
Oil is still gushing into the sea at a rate of about 800,000 litres <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> , but officials say working with only two leaks makes tackling the spill easier .
A controlled burn of the slick to remove oil from open water has also begun , AP news agency said .
And a special containment box to funnel oil to the surface from the leaking well is being sent to the site .
Engineers plan to lower the 100 - tonne concrete and steel box over the site on <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-04-29">Thursday</TIMEX3> , using remote - controlled submarines , officials say .
BP has never deployed such a structure at a depth of 5,000 ft -LRB- 1,500 m -RRB- and difficulties may occur , it says .
The operation is expected to take <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P2D" mod="MORE_THAN">more than two days</TIMEX3> .
If successful , BP said it hoped to begin pumping oil to the surface <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010-W19" mod="START">early next week</TIMEX3> .
Describing the cap , coast guard officer David Mosley told AP news agency : ` ` It does n't lessen the flow , it just simplifies the number of leak points they have to address . ''
A burn was last tried on <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2010-04-28">28 April</TIMEX3> when thousands of litres of oil were successfully removed .
Favourable weather conditions have <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> allowed crews to begin burning off more of the oil where it is most heavily concentrated , AP said .
Concerns for the impact of the burn on wildlife in the area have been dismissed by the body co - ordinating the response to the spill .
` ` No populated areas are expected to be affected by the controlled burn operations and there are no anticipated impacts to marine mammals and sea turtles , '' the Deepwater Horizon Incident Joint Information Center was quoted as saying by AFP .
The spill was set off by an explosion that destroyed the Deepwater Horizon oil rig and killed 11 workers off Louisiana <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2010-04">last month</TIMEX3> .
A sheen of oil has already reached the shore in parts of Louisiana , but officials say coagulated crude oil is not expected to reach coastal areas until the end of the week , AFP reports .
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration -LRB-
NOAA -RRB- said the oil slick was not expected to move much in <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="PXD">the next several days</TIMEX3> .
BP has told members of a US congressional committee that up to 9.5 m litres <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> could spill if the leaks worsen , AP notes .
