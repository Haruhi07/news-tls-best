There is still oil out there BP has finished pumping cement into the top of its damaged Gulf of Mexico oil well as part of its ` ` static kill '' procedure .
The move comes the day after it was announced that almost three - quarters of the oil spilled had been broken down by natural forces or cleaned up .
Oil leaked into the Gulf from <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">20 April</TIMEX3> when the Deepwater Horizon rig explosion killed 11 workers .
The flow was stopped on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-07-15">15 July</TIMEX3> .
Work on a relief well can <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> continue .
Cementing through the top of the well is complementary to a ` ` bottom kill '' that will be carried out soon .
The cementing of the well ` ` will virtually assure that there will be no chance of oil leaking into the environment '' , US oil spill response commander Thad Allen told reporters .
The relief well is about 100 ft -LRB- 30 m -RRB- from intersecting with the damaged well .
It will then be killed with mud and cement from the bottom .
A government report has said only a quarter of the oil from the BP well remains and that it is ` ` degrading quickly '' .
The majority has been captured , burned off or evaporated , it states .
But more clean - up is necessary , officials warn .
Meanwhile , US President Barack Obama said on <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010-08-04">Wednesday</TIMEX3> he was pleased that the operation in the Gulf was ` ` finally close to coming to an end '' .
` ` Our recovery efforts , though , will continue .
We have to reverse the damage that 's been done , '' he said .
The report on the fate of the spilt oil was compiled by 25 of ` ` the best government and independent scientists '' , the National Oceanic and Atmosphere Administration -LRB-
NOAA -RRB- said .
About a quarter of the oil released by the well evaporated or dissolved in the Gulf in the same way sugar dissolves in water , federal officials said .
Another one - sixth naturally dispersed when leaking out of the well , and an additional one - sixth was burned , skimmed , or dispersed using chemicals .
At a news conference , NOAA administrator Dr Jane Lubchenco said degraded oil was not a threat any longer because ` ` when it is biodegraded it ends up being water and carbon dioxide so if it has been biodegraded , if it is gone , then it is not a threat '' .
However , nearly 53 m gallons -LRB- 200 m litres -RRB- of oil remain in Gulf waters , which is close to five times the amount of the 11m - gallon Exxon Valdez spill in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="1989">1989</TIMEX3> .
An estimated 4.9 m barrels of oil leaked into the waters of the Gulf during <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="P87D">87 days</TIMEX3> , with only 800,000 barrels being captured .
