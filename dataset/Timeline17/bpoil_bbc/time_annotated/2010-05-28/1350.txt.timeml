Oil spill is worst in US history The oil spill off the coast of America is <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> the worst in US history .
Oil company BP 's latest operation to stop the leak is continuing .
Mud is being fired into the broken pipe to try to plug it up .
It 'll be a while before we know whether the muddy plan has worked , but BP says things are ` ` going to plan '' so far .
US President Barack Obama is making his second visit to the site of the leak .
He says he thinks about the spill morning and night .
He 's not the only Obama who 's thinking about the spill .
The president revealed that his daughter Malia asked him <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-W21">this week</TIMEX3> : ` ` Did you plug the hole yet , daddy ? ''
Mr Obama is expected to announce tough new rules about offshore drilling .
The muddy plan <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> under way is called ` ` top kill '' and there are worries because it 's never been tried in such deep water .
The Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">20 April</TIMEX3> and since then it 's thought that more than 27 million litres of oil has leaked into the sea .
