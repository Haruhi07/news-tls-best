All the top men are US citizens , and it was the US arm of the company who has let the name of the entire organization down .
Had a US oil tanker crashed in Samoa , for example , the US administration would be doing all it could to avoid as much liability as possible .
The ` B ' in ` BP ' is what 's leaving the company open to be attacked by the USA so vehemently .
Yes , it 's a disaster ,
yes it 's a tragedy , yes people 's livelihoods are on the line , but no BP did n't try and cause this
and yes they were abiding by the rules and regulations as they were laid out .
If you 're going to have any sort of management system , you have to have some sort of emergency preparedness in place for a worst case scenario .
That is the responsibility of the company , not only for it 's own management system , but for anything that it may impact , particularly the surrounding environment and economy in this case .
So far there has been approximately 500,000 gallons of oil leaking out <TIMEX3 tid="t36" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EVERY">every day</TIMEX3> for <TIMEX3 tid="t38" type="DURATION" value="P1M" mod="MORE_THAN">over a month</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> .

Accidents are statistically predictable , not where , when and what but we know from decades of experience that , sooner or later , something involving oil spillage would occur , it was always just a matter of time .
It was unfortunate for us all that it has been of such proportions and that even though BP have made enormous efforts , spending vast amounts of money on the clean - up and on capping the vent , the expertise for coping with events like this , on this scale , has not been developed enough so as to be a speedy and definitively complete response .
This needs to change , if we are to continue drilling in deep waters for oil , we need to know we can shut down a blown vent within a matter of hours , this technological ability has not yet been developed to anything like a satisfactory degree .
International oil companies need to pool resources and knowledge to combat these kinds of accidents until we can put in place a comprehensive set of procedures and technologies enforced by law that companies must adhere to .

It is perfectly possible to ensure this kind of thing does n't happen
but when it does it needs to be sorted as quickly as possible .
BP could have been a bit quicker about trying to plug the hole but if they have said they will clean up the mess what more can they do ?
Surely the US Government could have stepped in at some point , or nominated another oil company if they felt it was necessary , rather than let it get worse and worse before saying how much of a disaster it is ?
However , it is a good demonstration of why we need to find other sources of energy that are n't so detrimental to the environment .
Liberal Democrats , are you listening ?
BP have been admirable in their response to this accident , they ' ve done everything in their power to stem the leak & offered far more money in compensation than they 're legally obliged to .
I ca n't help but feel the US administration could have done more to help instead of Obama ` getting angry ' that it was n't stopped as quickly as everyone would have wished .
If they are so critical of BP 's operations I feel BP should pull out of all US business & show them how much BP 's product is needed , but I suspect another middle eastern invasion would make up for the shortfall .
They are quick to point out that the kit is not theirs , but spend weeks trying one daft idea after another .
One of their executives was stated as claiming this kind of disaster was next to impossible .

I believe this is the last mistake we should make with oil drilling .
this accident is devestating and should send flags to all the governments of the world to put an end to oil drilling in deep sea zones , who knows what damage we could cause before its too late I ' m still baffled as to how any oil drilling has been allowed without any kind of contingency plan in place in case this scenario occurred .
I mean - they did realize it could happen , did n't they ?
If Obama thinks they could have done better , why did n't they lift a finger and intervene .
They left it to BP .

Yes it is an environmental catastrophe
but as long as we want to burn oil then we need oil companies to develop these fields .

The engineering problems of operating at a depth of 5000 feet are considerable .
This is the end of cheap oil .
BP will pay up but they and other oil companies will all increase the operating costs .

Union Carbide has not been forced to fully clear up the mess left at Bhopal .

As a member of an international forum based in America i see comments and links to American news items .
I had to laugh at one comment that said Obama was threatening to bring in the navy if BP did n't sort it out quickly , what i 'd like to know is , are the American Navy <TIMEX3 tid="t196" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> trained in oil production ?
I thought they were trained in combat .
Seems like Obama just wants the glory of sorting it out .
A comment on an American news channel from a member of the public said that it should n't be down to Obama and the American government , but that BP should ` step up to the plate ' I note though that the BBC seem to have more information in their news broadcasts than the Americans do , so i do n't know where the failure lies in getting the information lies .
I ' ve been following progress on the BP website , go look for the latest responses , watch the videos , BP so far have ` stepped up to the plate ' with over # 930 Million in resources and compensation payments , they also called in other experts from their competitors to sort out this problem , they are throwing everything thhey have at this , no expense spared , and this is apparently not BP 's disaster as BP only leased the equipment to contractors , it 's like blaming the hire shop for improper use , but BP are there sorting it out .
If that is n't stepping up to the plate , i do n't know what is .

it 's fairly unprecedented for an oil well leak to go on for so long .
Obama himself said the problem is compounded by the depth at which the leak is taking place .
with this in mind , I think it 's perfectly sensible to halt any further development until proper contingency plans are laid out .
Not funny is n't it ? ? ?
How the oil spill seems to have overshadowed the human death toll in the initial explosion .
People not knowing what to do ...
Piper Alpha all over again .
already it seems , IT IS NOT ABOUT THE PEOPLE .
I am amazed by the general ignorance of some of the posts here .
Not as simple as that .
This is about pressure .
You need a pressure equal to or above the pressure coming from the well formation .
This is why only a top kill or relief well will fix it .
You ca n't just plug the well with some chewing gum .

Oh and of course , those horrible nasty people at BP who wanted this to happen if you believe some of the drivel on here .
This is how it works .
The drilling of the well is contracted to a drilling company along with many other subcontractors .

In this instance , Transocean -LRB- US company -RRB- , a drilling company along with Halliburton -LRB-
A dick cheney company -RRB- etc . .
They employ drillers who control the drilling and the well control .
Above them they would have a tool pusher who is their senior superviser .
Then you would have the ` company man ' who is a representative from BP and makes sure the well is being drilled to plan etc . .
Above him you will probably an offshore installation manager or perhaps a rig superintendent employed by Transocean .
Then you would probably have a barge capatain or similar .
So <TIMEX3 tid="t288" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> we can see there are many people in the chain of command on the rig so before you brand BP as the culprit maybe you need to look at the whole picture .
Any one of these people are empowered when it comes to well control .
But no , you wo n't want to believe any of that because you believe everything you read in the press .
How dare anyone discredit these people who worked on the rig .
They have a dangerous job to bring the fossil fuels YOU demand .
Whatever happened was catrostrophic .
Nobody allowed this to happen .
There are decision making failures made in all parts of life .
These people would never in a million years jeopardize an incident that could wrecks lives like this .
Clearly there were failures .
Does n't take a rocket scientist to figure that out .
People who are going round saying ` it 's BP 's fault ' do n't know what they are talking about .
It 's ok for the US to make up some kind of skewed logic to go and bomb iraq or afghanistan but woe betide
anyone who cause any damage on US soil .
Its us , the consumers , who are really to blame for all this .
We want to drive grossly overpowered cars and SUV 's and yet we cry wolf when the by product of that demand causes environmental damage .
Surely all those fumes that end up in the atmosphere from all those millions of cars choking the atmosphere will have a far more wider reaching effect than an oil spill in the gulf ?
This issue is far bigger than it appears and should n't be a money making exercise for unscrupulous lawyers seeking to punish anyone who has a whiff of a connection with this incident .
There are people who have a legitimate right to feel angry .
The people who have lost loved ones , employees on the rig , and people who have lost their livelihoods .
These people are heroes because they are having to go through times that are far tougher than we could ever imagine .
So spare a thought and before you make crass and pointless comments , take some time to understand what is really going and show respect for the people who have truly been affected by this .

It does not seem like enough .
It is n't enough .
I could say the same thing about both the Obama administration and the corporate culture that many here have said .
But it deflects from the consequences of this gusher , that , quite frankly , has already changed the area .
The Gulf region will be contaminated far beyond my own life span .
In a very general sense , my reaction has been very emotional .
I ' ve been scared , sad , frustrated and angry .
The impact is devastating .

But my anger has been that BP has been playing at ` ` fixing '' this problem .
I think they should destroy the well and cut their losses instead of playing with top hats and domes and straws .
From my perspective , it is really difficult NOT to see this as corporate greed .

But if we are talking a financial bottom line , I would think that at the cost of this ` ` clean up '' , destroying the well would actually be a bit cheaper -- in the long run .

And , if they have to have that oil , drill again , close by , BUT THE NEXT TIME TAKING PROPER SAFETY PRECAUTIONS .
I ' m not sure what the rest of the world is hearing about this situation .
But this is what I ' ve heard and what has left an impression in my mind .
BP\/Transocean cut corners on safety measures , to what amounts to $ 500,000 for a safety component on the well head .
That 's why the methane was not sealed and the methane caused the explosion that resulted in 11 dead people and the gusher .
Because the well head is a mile down in the water , actual humans can not get to it .
It 's too deep .
There is also the fact that BP has a history , at least in the US , of failing to have proper safety measures in place -- on rigs and at oil plants .
This accident comes right after BP was fined the largest ever fine for safety violations for a follow up at a refinery in Texas that had previously had an event during which 15 people died .
So , I know for myself that I think BP has not learned from previous accidents -LRB- this Texas accident was within <TIMEX3 tid="t306" type="DURATION" value="PXY">the last few years</TIMEX3> , so it 's <TIMEX3 tid="t305" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> -RRB- .
To me , this seems as though BP thinks it 's easier and better financially to continue to payout these hefty fines than to actually ensure safety and protect people and the environment .
That being said , I also blame the US government .
This is just one more example of my government not watching out for its citizens ' interests but instead championing corporate interests .
We saw it in the banking industry .
These are the things that happen when government is not in the business of regulation .
Capitalism , in the <TIMEX3 tid="t307" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> US form , is idiotic .
It has been proven over and over in industry after industry that business will NOT regulate itself .

So , yes , I ' m sick that this is just one more thing down the line where the US government has failed to protect me from , via more stringent regulation and enforcement of regulations already on the books -- and for having sold my interests away to an oil rig in the Gulf .
But blame hardly satisfies me .
I know it 's important to know who to blame for what in order to remedy the process , the institution , etc . .
But the gushing continues .
We ca n't run away from it .
It 's knocking ...
It 's terrifying .
I want BP to actually do something .
Their efforts have been relatively minor in comparison to the problem .
Bring in the entire fleet , stop poisoning with chemicals , and blow the well head up and stop the gushing once and for all .

BP played the odds that nothing would ever happen and it lost .
The ad hoc nature of BP 's attempts clearly to stop the oil leak shows that BP never had any viable emergency plans to put into action .
Moreover big money corrupts absolutely and it seems that BP had a cozy relationship with the government agencies whose job it was to oversee and regulate offshore drilling .
The Bush administration shredded almost all drilling regulations and castrated the minerals and mining regulatory agency from imposing whatever regulations remained on oil companies .
Even Sarah Palin shouted ` ` Drill Baby Drill ! ''
in a typically dumb Republican fashion .
It 's an example of how big corporations influence government and when adversity strikes they try to circumvent their responsibility by passsing the blame onto someone else as occurred by company execs in testiomonials before Congress .
As the world 's technology grows and becomes more complex and intertwined , the solutions to the problems caused by this technology will have to become more complex .
Deep - sea oil rigs are complex .

The media has done an awful job of feeding the important facts , but ranting seems to sell more adverts .
Cleaning the shoreline is a different matter , but that seems hampered by lack of physical equipment .
Correcting that lack is not a matter of opening a can of people , nor of suggesting that if BP spent a tiny bit more money all would be well .
It is matter of increasing global production capacity and , however much we wish it were otherwise , that takes time .
There are some regulatory questions that would benefit from government attention , most notable is the desire to erect sand berms on barrier islands .
But BP is clearly doing most of the right stuff and the government is mostly doing the right thing by not getting in their way -LRB- too much -RRB- .
BP should have just come out with the truth to start and should have not taken all the shortcuts for faster drilling , replacing ` mud ' with salt water ... threatening news crews for filming what was going on in the coast .

The physical environmental consequences have been immediate .
Why should n't we expect the response to it be the same ?
Ultimately , the responsibility to look out for the public interest rests on the goverment and Obama 's reaction was a joke .
Literally a joke , for the first few days of the spill the adoring media was pushing headlines about how he was funnier than Jay Leno .
When he could n't avoid it anymore , he went into finger pointing mode .
He was blaming BP with one breath , and with the next he said they were better capable of handling it than the government .
What kind of leadership is that ?
BP really damaged themselves with the escalating barrels per day estimates .
I think they wasted a lot of time trying to save the well , but by that time it should n't have been their decision .
They made mistakes , but they are the only ones who accepted responsibility and worked to solve the problem .
That will go a long way in vindicating them .
The press shares some blame too .
They 're still extremely reluctant to point the finger at the only person who had the power to take control .
Environmentalists also refused to address the situation .
They put party politics over the environment .
They went off on rants about offshore drilling , but had no practical suggestions on how to deal with what was already happening .
They tolerated the federal inaction out of loyalty .
They too avoided criticizing the administration .
They reminded me of the feminists that defended Clinton 's womanizing .
That is just the clean up , the actual cause of the blowout is another story .
The people who are most to blame are the morons who are trying to blame Bush , Cheney and Palin .
Blaming politicians who are n't even in power anymore is ridiculous .
I have no issues with the response .
The planning of drilling this wellhead , the safety review , the poor execution , those are what we should be focusing on .
When an arsonist lights a building on fire , the police does n't start investigating the fire department for their inability to douse it quickly enough .
The urgent short term issue is to plug the leak , contain the oil , and perform the cleanup .
But the FAR more important issue is to reduce our dependence on oil over the longer term .
Fuel efficiency and renewable energy need to be our top domestic priorities , even above the economic recovery . ''

Risk is measured as the product of probability of the hazard occurring and the consequence .
For any system where the consequences of component failure are above the ` ` no way '' line of consequence then the safeguards for the probability of hazard occurrence must be infinitesimally low .
To achieve that there would need to be at least 3 levels of assurance i.e. warning when the first level of assurance fails with the second level kicking in immediately .
There should have been means of shutting down the oil supply at that stage .
If the second level of assurance failed then the third should kick in while the supply is shut down .

The fact that BP is shilling out a couple hundred million to plug up the spill is not sufficient , because our tourism and fishing industries -LRB- as well as those in Mexico and other countries affected by the spill -RRB- have lost billions .
The US government should fine BP enough money to compensate every person who has been made unemployed and\/or been made to suffer economically or in matters of health because it was their faulty equipment , their desire to put profits ahead of the health and well being of our planet and the people of the nations that border the gulf that caused this tragedy .
