The spill damaged wildlife and livelihoods along the US Gulf Coast The Obama administration blocked government scientists ' efforts to inform the public of worst case scenarios , a draft report said .
But spokesman Robert Gibbs said the White House had not tried to block ` ` the most accurate and timely information '' .
The commission was appointed by President Barack Obama .
The explosion on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig on <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">20 April</TIMEX3> killed 11 workers , and led to the pollution of hundreds of miles of shoreline and disruption of tourism and fishing before the leaking well was capped on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-07-15">15 July</TIMEX3> .
In preliminary findings released on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-10-06">Wednesday</TIMEX3> , the National Oil Spill Commission said officials were too optimistic about handling the disaster , one of the worst in US history .
In a briefing for journalists on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010-10-07">Thursday</TIMEX3> , Mr Gibbs said the draft ` ` has not necessarily been signed off by members of the commission '' .
The report suggests the White House was directly involved in controlling information from the spill .
The report says that during the crucial first <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P10D">10 days</TIMEX3> of the oil spill the government 's response ` ` seemed to lag '' - and that coastguard officials were ` ` overly - optimistic '' in believing BP could handle the incident .
Government scientists are accused of first underestimating the amount of oil pouring into the Gulf and then overestimating the quantity which had evaporated or otherwise been removed from the sea .
The report says the president 's adviser on energy policy , Carol Browner , stated wrongly on American television that three - quarters of the oil had ` ` gone '' , and that the White House blocked a request by officials to make public a worst - case scenario for the scale of the leak .

The panel , which cited interviews with government officials , said that in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2010-04" mod="END">late April</TIMEX3> or <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2010-05" mod="START">early May</TIMEX3> , the White House budget office had denied a request from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration -LRB-
NOAA -RRB- to make public its worst - case estimate of how much oil could leak from the Macondo well .

But the White House said in a statement that Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and Thad Allen , the retired Coast Guard admiral in charge of the response , had told the public the worst - case scenario could be more than 4.2 million gallons per day .
BP 's drilling permit for the well said 6.8 million gallons could pour from the well during the worst - case scenario .
NOAA and the Coast Guard later received an updated worst - case scenario just after the spill had begun , putting the estimate at 2.7 million to 4.6 million gallons per day .
The National Oil Spill Commission report says those numbers , which were used as the basis for the administration 's spill response , were never made public - though they appeared on an internal Coast Guard situation report .
The report also says the federal government used too much boom to stop the oil from spreading - especially in the US state of Louisiana , where directions went out to ` ` keep the parishes happy '' .
The pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ?
