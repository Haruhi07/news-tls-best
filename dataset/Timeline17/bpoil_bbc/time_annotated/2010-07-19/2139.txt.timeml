BP can keep oil cap closed for another day , says Allen Admiral Paul Zukunft , US Coast Guard : ` ` There is no new oil coming up at the source '' BP is being allowed to keep the cap on its damaged well shut for another <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P1D">24 hours</TIMEX3> , says the US official in charge of the Gulf of Mexico oil clean - up .
In a letter to BP , Adm Thad Allen expressed concern about a ` ` detected seep '' on the sea floor near the well and other ` ` undetermined anomalies '' .
The firm has pledged to monitor the sea floor for signs of a new leak closely .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-07-19">Monday</TIMEX3> , Coast Guard Adm Paul Zukunft said : ` ` We ' ve had no indication of oil being released at the site . ''
BP has noted that seepage can be a natural phenomenon .
The fears over seepage coincided with a bad day for the oil giant in the stock markets .
BP shares closed down more than 4.5 % in London and plunged sharply during early trading in New York .
After installing a new cap , BP has been doing pressure tests to see if the well can be kept shut .
Adm Allen has said that if methane was found to be seeping from the sea floor , this might mean oil was also leaking .
He has ordered BP to submit a plan to reopen the well in case oil is still leaking .
This would allow the crude to be piped to the surface .
But BP says it would take <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P3D">three days</TIMEX3> to start this process .
If the cap is reopened , the daily leakage of tens of thousands of barrels of oil could resume .
In a statement released on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-07-19">Monday</TIMEX3> , Adm Allen said a federal science team had held a conference call with BP representatives on <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="TIME" value="2010-07-18TNI">Sunday night</TIMEX3> .
He said the scientists had received the answers they wanted about how BP was monitoring the seabed in case of any new leaks .
The well began leaking oil into the Gulf after BP 's Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded on <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">20 April</TIMEX3> , killing 11 workers .
BP had hoped the cap could stay in place until relief wells stopped the leak for good .
I direct you to provide me a written procedure for opening the choke valve as quickly as possible ''

Quote Adm Thad Allen Letter to BP But with pressure readings from within the well lower than expected , scientists had raised concerns that oil could be leaking into the surrounding undersea bedrock .
And in his letter to BP chief managing director Bob Dudley , Adm Allen said : ` ` Given the <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> observations ... including the detected seep a distance from the well and undetermined anomalies at the well head , monitoring of the seabed is of paramount importance ...
` ` I direct you to provide me a written procedure for opening the choke valve as quickly as possible without damaging the well should hydrocarbon seepage near the wellhead be confirmed . ''
The flow of oil from the well was shut off by the cap on <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2010-07-15">Thursday</TIMEX3> and testing has continued since then .
The Gulf of Mexico spill has been described as the worst environmental disaster the US has seen .
The spill has affected hundreds of miles of Gulf coastline , with serious economic damage as tourists have avoided Gulf Coast beaches and fishing grounds have remained closed .
BP has put the costs of dealing with the disaster at more than $ 3.95 bn -LRB- # 2.6 bn -RRB- .
It has already paid out more than $ 200 m in compensation .
British Prime Minister David Cameron is to meet US President Barack Obama in Washington on <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2010-07-13">Tuesday</TIMEX3> , and BP is expected to be a key topic of discussion .
