By Laurence Knight Business reporter , BBC News BP want some way to draw a line under the Gulf of Mexico disaster and move on Things are not so bad <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> .
BP 's share price - which had more than halved since the Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-04-01">April first</TIMEX3> triggered the company 's woes - has staged an impressive recovery in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent weeks</TIMEX3> .
Yet talk continues to circulate of a possible strategic investor in BP - either as a welcome provider of fresh capital to the company , or an unwelcome opportunist sniffing a bargain .
So what are the options <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> for BP ?
On <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010-06-16">16 June</TIMEX3> , the cost of buying financial protection for <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">one year</TIMEX3> against a possible debt default by BP reached a staggering 10 % .
I think markets are -LRB- pricing in -RRB- a scenario considerably bleaker than will prove to be the case . ''
End Quote Alan Sinclair Oil and gas analyst , Seymour Pierce During those panicky days , credit markets were in effect saying that a BP bankruptcy in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="PXY">the next few years</TIMEX3> was more likely than not .
Things have calmed down since then , although the oil giant 's bonds still trade at prices comparable with companies rated ` ` junk '' , even though the credit rating agencies have yet to actually stick that ignominious label on BP .
The about turn has been extraordinary .
Before its money and reputation began bleeding away in the Gulf of Mexico , the oil giant was considered the safest of blue chip companies , because its debts were so low and its income so high .
` ` I think markets are -LRB- pricing in -RRB- a scenario considerably bleaker than will prove to be the case , '' says Alan Sinclair , oil and gas analyst at stock brokers Seymour Pierce .
He points out that just by canceling its remaining dividends <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2010">this year</TIMEX3> , the company should already have enough money in hand to cover what he expects to be the $ 6bn -LRB- # 4bn -RRB- direct cost of the clean - up .
That is about double what the company has already forked out to date .
` ` If you add in all the civil liabilities ... I would be surprised if it comes to more than the $ 20bn they already agreed to set aside , '' Mr Sinclair adds , on the assumption that the relief wells <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> being drilled succeed in stopping the leak in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2009-08">August</TIMEX3> .
The company could seek ways to limit its liability to the oil spill .
There is already a statutory limit under US law for oil spill costs of a mere $ 75 m , but BP long ago waived this limit , as hiding behind it would have been politically untenable .
However , BP had two co - investors in the Deepwater Horizon well - Anadarko of the US and Mitsui of Japan - who together own 35 % of the project .
The UK company has called on its partners to pay their share of the spiralling costs , and Mr Sinclair thinks that if it comes to a legal fight , BP would prevail .
The oil firm could also take more active steps to limit its liability , for instance through a selective bankruptcy of its US business .
But this would almost certainly be unpalatable to the company 's board , as it would enrage US politicians , including President Barack Obama , and probably cut off the entire US market to BP .
So the political reality is that BP 's liability in the Gulf of Mexico remains unlimited , and this continues to weigh down the company 's share price .
Strategic investor or acquisition target ?
In this context , speculation has arisen that BP may look to an outside investor to provide a capital injection to help cover these costs .
Share price lowest point -LRB- on <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2010-06-25">25 June</TIMEX3> -RRB- : 296p -LRB- 55 % fall -RRB- Credit default swap spread -LRB- <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DURATION" value="P5Y">5 years</TIMEX3> -RRB- : 4.1 % per annum Data : Bloomberg as of <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2010-07-06">6 July 2010</TIMEX3> Or alternatively it could fall victim to an unwanted suitor looking to buy up the company cheaply on the stock market .
Kuwait is high on the list .
It has had a relationship with the company ever since the UK government sold British Petroleum on the stock exchange in <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="1987">1987</TIMEX3> .
But Kuwait 's involvement in that flotation serves as a useful case study in the politics of such investments .
The Kuwait Investment Authority helpfully bought almost 30 % of the company after the sale was almost derailed by the stock market crash .
But the Arabs later came under pressure from Downing Street to give up hopes of a takeover and scale back their investment .
Yet <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DATE" value="2010-07-06">today</TIMEX3> Kuwait may be the most attractive suitor .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t37" type="DATE" value="2010-07-05">Monday</TIMEX3> , Libya voiced interest in making a grab for the company .
Resource - hungry China is also mentioned as a possibility .
Its national oil company attempted to buy California 's Unocal in <TIMEX3 tid="t38" type="DATE" value="2005">2005</TIMEX3> , only to be blocked by the White House on national security grounds .
Among fellow oil companies , the names of Exxon Mobil and Shell are also being bandied about .
But the resulting company might be unacceptably big and powerful for US and European anti - trust authorities .
` ` Even in Europe , the EU would have a fit about the anti - trust implications , '' says Mr Sinclair of Seymour Pierce .
Indeed , he thinks the entire idea of an investor buying BP itself is questionable .
Libya may be one of the less welcome suitors ` ` Why take on a company that is about to undertake <TIMEX3 tid="t42" type="DURATION" value="PXY">several years</TIMEX3> of litigation ...
-LRB- with -RRB- unquantifiable potential civil penalties ? ''
Instead , he points to asset sales by BP as the likely way forwards .
BP could for example spin off US subsidiary Atlantic Richfield to one of its rivals .
Or it could sell individual wells and exploration rights to the Chinese .
This would minimize both political and anti - trust issues , and allow BP 's existing management to keep control .
` ` BP can afford to fork out $ 4bn <TIMEX3 tid="t44" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> by selling assets ... and being flexible about -LRB- capital expenditure -RRB- , '' notes Mr Sinclair .
The last possibility , and one that some market participants may be considering seriously again , is that BP will recover fully from its <TIMEX3 tid="t46" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> debacle .
Having promised to set aside $ 20bn in a dedicated ` ` escrow '' account , some are hopeful there may be a tacit agreement with the White House that this figure will represent a cap on the company 's liabilities .
The pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ?
