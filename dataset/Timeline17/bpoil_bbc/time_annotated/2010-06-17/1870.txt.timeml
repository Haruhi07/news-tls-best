President Obama 's statement about BP 's compensation fund Oil giant BP is to put $ 20bn -LRB- # 13.5 bn -RRB- in a compensation fund for victims of the Gulf oil spill and will not pay shareholders a dividend <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2010">this year</TIMEX3> .
Barack Obama announced the compensation deal after talks at the White House with senior BP executives .
Shortly afterwards , BP chairman Carl - Henric Svanberg said dividends would not be paid for the rest of <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010">this year</TIMEX3> .
The payout fund is to be run by Kenneth Feinberg , a lawyer who oversaw compensation after the 9\/11 attacks .
In his <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> role as Mr Obama 's ` ` pay tsar '' , Mr Feinberg sets salary limits for executives at firms in receipt of federal bailout funds .
Mr Obama said a $ 120 m fund would also be set up to compensate oil industry workers .
He said he had heard growing concerns about the pace of compensation payments , and that the new fund would ensure all ` ` legitimate '' claims were paid .
` ` If you or your business has suffered economic loss as a result of this spill you will be able to file a claim , '' the president said .
Although BP has agreed to fund $ 20bn - roughly equivalent to <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">one year</TIMEX3> of BP 's annual profits - reports said there could be no cap on the amount BP might be asked to contribute to the fund .
The company will pay $ 5bn into the fund , called an escrow fund , before <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010" mod="END">the end of 2010</TIMEX3> , plus $ 1bn per quarter for the following <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P3Y">three years</TIMEX3> .
Speaking after the talks , Mr Svanberg expressed regret over the spill , saying BP felt ` ` sorrow and sadness for the tragic accident which should never have happened '' .
BP chairman Carl - Henric Svanberg after White House meeting ` ` Words are not enough .
We understand we will
and we should be judged by our actions , '' he said .
` ` We will live up to all our legitimate responsibilities . ''
Mr Svanberg was also forced to apologise after telling reporters that BP was not a greedy company and that it cared ` ` about the small people '' .
He later said he ` ` spoke clumsily '' .
The last time that BP suspended a dividend payment was during World War II .
The company was due to make a $ 2.6 bn dividend payment on <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-06-14">Monday</TIMEX3> , which has <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> been canceled .
In addition , BP said it would sell off ` ` non - core '' assets worth some $ 10bn in an attempt to cut costs in the <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">coming year</TIMEX3> .
BP 's chief executive , Briton Tony Hayward , and the boss of BP America , Lamar McKay , accompanied Mr Svanberg to the White House .
Mr Hayward , who has come under heavy criticism for his handling of the crisis , is scheduled to give evidence to a US House of Representatives committee on <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2010-06-17">Thursday</TIMEX3> .
There remains some confusion over how far the definition of ` ` legitimate responsibilities '' should stretch .
Earlier in the day UK Prime Minister David Cameron said BP was concerned the claims could be submitted ` ` three or four times removed '' from the spill .
The company has been accused of failing to follow proper procedures in the run - up to the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig on <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">20 April</TIMEX3> .
The blast led to the deaths of 11 people , caused the rig to sink and has since seen hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil spew into the Gulf of Mexico .

The fallout is affecting businesses and wildlife , as well as wiping billions of dollars off BP 's value .
BP 's share price rose in US trading after an earlier slump as news of the funding deal emerged , but dipped as the day wore on and more details emerged .
In its latest effort to contain the oil spewing into the Gulf of Mexico , BP announced on <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="TIME" value="2010-06-16TMO">Wednesday morning</TIMEX3> that it had begun operating a second containment system designed to bring oil and gas to the surface for burning .
BP managed to place a cap over the leaking oil pipe <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2010-06" mod="START">earlier this month</TIMEX3> , and is <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> collecting some of the oil .
However , estimates of how much oil is gushing out of the well have again risen dramatically since the start of the crisis .

A government panel of scientists <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> believes 35,000 - 60 , 000 barrels are leaking <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EACH">each day</TIMEX3> , up from its estimate <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2010-W23">last week</TIMEX3> of 20,000 - 40 , 000 .
