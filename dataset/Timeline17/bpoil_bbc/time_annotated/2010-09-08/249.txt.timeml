BP faces backlash over Gulf oil spill report The explosion on the Deepwater Horizon killed 11 workers and injured 17 Drilling firm Transocean branded the report ` ` self serving '' while cement contractor Halliburton said it contained ` ` omissions and inaccuracies '' .
BP blamed a ` ` sequence of failures involving a number of different parties '' for the spill .
It faces billions of dollars worth of compensation claims over the disaster .
Transocean dismissed BP 's report , accusing the oil giant of having designed a ` ` fatally flawed '' well and making ` ` cost - saving decisions that increased risk - in some cases , severely '' .
` ` This is a self - serving report that attempts to conceal the critical factor that set the stage for the Macondo -LRB-
well -RRB- incident : BP 's fatally flawed well design , '' the Swiss - based group said in a statement .
Halliburton also hit back at the 193 - page report .
` ` As we continue to review BP 's internal report published <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-09-08" mod="START">earlier today</TIMEX3> , we have noticed a number of substantial omissions and inaccuracies in the document , '' it said .
` ` Halliburton remains confident that all the work it performed with respect to the Macondo well was completed in accordance with BP 's specifications for its well construction plan and instructions , and that it is fully indemnified under its contract for any of the allegations contained in the report . ''
The rig exploded in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-04">April</TIMEX3> , killing 11 people , and an estimated 4.9 m barrels of oil then leaked into the Gulf .

BP leased the Deepwater Horizon rig from Transocean , and its cement contractor was Halliburton .
The BP report was critical of the processes and actions of teams from both firms .
The report , conducted by BP 's head of safety , Mark Bly , highlighted eight key failures that , in combination , led to the explosion .
BP said that both BP and Transocean staff incorrectly interpreted a safety test which should have flagged up risks of a blowout .
` ` Over a 40 - minute period , the Transocean rig crew failed to recognize and act on the influx of hydrocarbons into the well '' which eventually caused the explosion .
BP criticised the cementing of the well - carried out by Halliburton - and repeated previous criticism of the blowout preventer .
Among the other findings , the report said : There were ` ` no indications '' that Transocean had tested intervention systems at the surface , ` ` as was required by Transocean policy '' , before they were deployed on the well ` ` Improved engineering rigor , cement testing and communication of risk '' by Halliburton could have identified flaws in cement design and testing , quality assurance and risk assessment
A Transocean rig crew and a team described as ` ` mudloggers '' working for Halliburton Sperry Sun may have been distracted by what are described as ` ` end - of - well activities '' and , as a result , important monitoring was not carried out for <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DURATION" value="PT7H" mod="MORE_THAN">more than seven hours</TIMEX3> Crew may have had more time to respond before the explosion if they had diverted escaping fluids overboard .
` ` To put it simply , there was a bad cement job and a failure of the shoe track barrier at the bottom of the well , which let hydrocarbons from the reservoir into the production casing , '' said outgoing chief executive Tony Hayward .
` ` The negative pressure test was accepted when it should not have been , there were failures in well control procedures and in the blowout preventer ; and the rig 's fire and gas system did not prevent ignition , '' he said .
The blowout preventer that failed was recovered from the Gulf of Mexico on <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2010-09-04">Saturday</TIMEX3> .
It will be placed in the custody of the US Justice Department and examined .
BP 's incoming chief executive Bob Dudley said the report proved that the explosion was ` ` a shared responsibility among many entities '' .
The company said it had accepted all the recommendations in the report , and would implement them worldwide .
` ` We are determined to learn the lessons for the future and we will be undertaking a broad - scale review to further improve the safety of our operations , '' Mr Dudley said in a statement .
BP says dealing with the aftermath of the spill has cost $ 8bn -LRB- # 5.2 bn -RRB- , and it has already paid out about $ 399 m in claims to people affected by the spill .
A national commission is expected to submit a report to President Barack Obama by <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2010-01">January</TIMEX3> .
A Congressional joint investigation will submit a report later than month .

The US justice department is also investigating the disaster .
The Deepwater Horizon explosion according to BP <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="2011-04-19">19 April</TIMEX3> - ` Bad ' cement is pumped down casing to stop gas and oil -LRB- hydrocarbons -RRB- leaking into wellbore <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">20 April</TIMEX3> - Gas and oil leak through shoe track barrier and float collar valves Tests carried out on the rig incorrectly suggest pressure is at a safe level because the lie to check pressure is blocked The crew do not recognize there is a major problem or act to control it until the hydrocarbons are flowing rapidly up the riser
The crew close the blowout preventer and diverter , routing oil and gas to the mud gas separator -LRB- MGS -RRB- system rather than diverting it overboard The MGS is overwhelmed by the force of oil and gas which leaks into the rig 's ventilation system The heating , ventilation and air conditioning system is thought to have sent a gas - rich mixture into the engine rooms <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="2149">2149</TIMEX3> local time .
There are two huge explosions , killing 11 men <TIMEX3 tid="t36" type="DATE" value="2011-04-21">April 21</TIMEX3> - <TIMEX3 tid="t37" type="DATE" value="2011-04-22">22</TIMEX3> .
The BOP designed to work automatically fails to seal the well as control pods and cutter -LRB-
blind sheer ram -RRB- are not working The pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ?
