Oil firm BP has lowered a cap on to a leaking oil well in the Gulf of Mexico , in the hope of piping some of the oil to ships on the surface .
Video footage showed the cap lowered into place against pressure from escaping oil and gas .
BP said some oil had started flowing up the pipe attached to the cap , but it could take the rest of the day to determine how much .
The US Coast Guard said the cap would only be a temporary , partial fix .
Live underwater video footage from the site on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2010-06-04">Friday</TIMEX3> showed quantities of oil still escaping into the sea .
BP 's latest attempt to cap the well followed mounting criticism from US President Barack Obama .
He told CNN that he had not seen ` ` the kind of rapid response '' to the disaster that he would have liked and that BP had already ` ` felt his anger '' over the spill .
He said was ` ` furious at this entire situation '' .
The latest stage in BP 's efforts to contain leaking oil has involved lowering a cap onto the failed blowout preventer -LRB- BOP -RRB- valve system on the seabed .
The cap sits on the BOP 's lower marine riser package -LRB- LMRP -RRB- section .
First , the damaged riser - the pipe which takes oil from the well - was cut where it nears the seabed using a remotely - operated shear .
This was completed at <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="1930">1930</TIMEX3> CDT on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-06-01">1 June</TIMEX3> -LRB- <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="TIME" value="2010-06-01T00:30">0030
GMT</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010-06-02">2 June</TIMEX3> -RRB- .
The next stage was for a diamond wire cutter to saw through the riser close to the LMRP .
The blade got stuck and had to be removed but BP eventually cut through the pipe using giant shears manipulated by undersea robots -LRB-
ROV -RRB- .
After removing the pipe , the cap was lowered onto the LMRP enabling the leaking oil and gas to be funnelled to a drill ship on the surface .
Latest estimates suggest more than half of the leaking oil is <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> being captured .

He is due to visit the gulf later on <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2010-06-04">Friday</TIMEX3> - his third trip to the area since the leak began <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-W16">six weeks ago</TIMEX3> .
BP 's share price rose 4 % in early European trading .
Chief executive Tony Hayward is to hold a conference call with investors , which will be available to the public on the company 's website , from <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="1400">1400</TIMEX3> BST -LRB- <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="TIME" value="2010-06-04T13:00">1300 GMT</TIMEX3> -RRB- .
Mr Hayward is expected to try to reassure investors .
BBC economics correspondent Andrew Walker says one key question is whether BP will pay shareholders its dividend as normal .
He says if it does , this will go down very badly in the US , where pressure is mounting for BP to retain the cash for the clean - up .
Mr Hayward has said the results of the latest capping effort should be known later on <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2010-06-04">Friday</TIMEX3> .

Chief operating officer Doug Suttles said on <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2010-06-04">Friday</TIMEX3> : ` ` There is flow coming up the pipe .
Just <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> , I do n't know the exact rate . ''
BP has said it does not expect to be able to fully halt the oil flow until <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2010-08">August</TIMEX3> , when two relief wells will be completed .
In the first phase of the latest effort to contain the spill , robots cut a leaking pipe .
BP then used giant shears manipulated by undersea robots to snip off the end of the pipe , after a diamond - edged saw failed to do the job .

A funnel - like cap has been placed on top , which if successful , would improve oil recovery and BP would hope to collect the oil on a surface ship above the well .
The US Coast Guard said the placement of the cap was a positive development , but that it would be ` ` some time before we can confirm that this method will work and to what extent it will mitigate the release of oil into the environment '' .
Mr Hayward acknowledged that what engineers were doing had never been tried before , and said there were many challenges ahead .
The White House has been under increasing pressure to show the administration is in control of the response and clean - up efforts .
The government said on <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2010-06-03">Thursday</TIMEX3> it would send a $ 69 m -LRB- # 47.1 m -RRB- bill to BP for expenditure incurred from its response to the spill .
BP estimates that the disaster has so far cost the company about $ 990 m .
A ` ` top kill '' procedure , which had been considered the best hope for plugging the leak , failed over <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2010-W21-WE">the weekend</TIMEX3> .
The Deepwater Horizon drilling rig , leased to BP , exploded and sank in <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2010-04">April</TIMEX3> , killing 11 workers .
The pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ?
