BP has tried a number of methods to shut down the leak from the damaged oil well - often innovating as subsequent attempts have failed .
Although some of the methods have been tried and tested at incidents elsewhere in the world , they have not been carried out at such great depth as the Deepwater Horizon leak - 5,000 feet -LRB- 1.5 km -RRB- below the surface .
2 JUNE :
LOWER MARINE RISER PACKAGE After the failure of the top kill procedure , BP attempts to cut the top off the upper section of the blowout
preventer -LRB- BOP -RRB- and place a cap on it , sealing the leak and taking oil to a ship on the surface .
After a brief setback with some of the cutting equipment , the cap is installed and BP announces on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-06-04">4 June</TIMEX3> that it is collecting oil at a rate of 1,000 barrels <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> .
The latest stage in BP 's efforts to contain leaking oil has involved lowering a cap onto the failed blowout preventer -LRB- BOP -RRB- valve system on the seabed .
The cap sits on the BOP 's lower marine riser package -LRB- LMRP -RRB- section .
First , the damaged riser - the pipe which takes oil from the well - was cut where it nears the seabed using a remotely - operated shear .
This was completed at <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="1930">1930</TIMEX3> CDT on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-06-01">1 June</TIMEX3> -LRB- <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="TIME" value="2010-06-01T00:30">0030
GMT</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010-06-02">2 June</TIMEX3> -RRB- .
The next stage was for a diamond wire cutter to saw through the riser close to the LMRP .
The blade got stuck and had to be removed but BP eventually cut through the pipe using giant shears manipulated by undersea robots -LRB-
ROV -RRB- .
After removing the pipe , the cap was lowered onto the LMRP enabling the leaking oil and gas to be funnelled to a drill ship on the surface .
Latest estimates suggest more than half of the leaking oil is <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> being captured .
BACK -LCB- <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> -RCB- of -LCB- total -RCB- NEXT <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2010-05-26">26 MAY</TIMEX3> - <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2010-05-29">29 MAY</TIMEX3> : TOP KILL OF BLOWOUT PREVENTER - FAILED Turning their focus to the blowout preventer or BOP that sits over the well head , BP try to stem the flow of oil and gas and ultimately kill the well by injecting heavy drilling fluids .
The procedure includes injecting a ` ` junkshot '' of golf balls , rope and rubber into the BOP in a bid to block the flow .
Despite pumping more than 30,000 barrels of heavy mud itno the BOP and a range of junkshot , the operation fails to overcome the flow from the well .
<TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2010-05-16">16 MAY</TIMEX3> : RISER INSERTION TUBE - SUCCESS BP had some success with a ` ` riser insertion tube '' - a pipe with rubber diaphragm inserted into the leaking part of the riser pipe that is the source of the main oil flow from the well .
The insertion tuibe is connected to its own riser pipe that takes the oil and gas to the Transocean Discoverer Enterprise drillship , 5,000 ft -LRB- 1,524 m -RRB- above on the surface .
Methanol is injected into the tube to stop the formation of hydrates - crystals that could block the flow of oil and gas .
The tube tool has been able to collect about 3,000 barrels <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> of oil and some 14 million standard cubic feet <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> of gas .
The oil is being stored and gas is being flared on the drillship Discoverer Enterprise - which has the capacity to store 139,000 barrels of oil .
<TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2010-05-08">8</TIMEX3> - <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2010-05-18">18 MAY</TIMEX3> : CONTAINER DOME AND TOP HAT - FAILED Plans to place a large containment dome over the main leak and siphon oil to a ship on the surface is aborted as hydrates or ice crystals build up , blocking the pipes .
A smaller ` ` top hat '' dome is lowered to perform a similar task , but engineers decide to use insertion tube instead .
Underwater efforts to cap oil leak Initially , BP tried to lower a 125 - tonne , 18 - metre -LRB- 59 feet -RRB- high container dome over the main leak on the sea floor .
However , this failed when gas leaking from the pipe mixed with water to form hydrates , ice - like crystals , that blocked up the steel canopy .
Instead , engineers have lowered a smaller device onto the site .
Dubbed the Top hat , it will sit over the tear in the pipe and partially stop the leak .
To prevent the build up of hydrates , methanol is pumped into the top hat to disperse the water and gas .
The top hat is 1.5 m -LRB- 5 feet -RRB- high and 1.2 m in diameter .
Two special side lines are used to pump methanol into the top hat to displace water and gas leaking from the broken oil pipe .
This should prevent the build - up of hydrates .
Once in place , oil can be pumped up to the surface .
BP plan to lower the original subsea containment dome over the top hat to provide a better seal over the leaking site and pump oil up to the surface .
This time , it will be attached to a pipe that can pump warm water into the dome to prevent the build - up of hydrates .

Work on the first relief well started on <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2010-05-02">2 May</TIMEX3> , with the second starting on <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2010-05-16">16 May</TIMEX3> .
Both wells are expected to take <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DURATION" value="P3M" mod="APPROX">around three months</TIMEX3> to complete from the start of drilling .
