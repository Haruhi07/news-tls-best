One of BP 's partners in the deepwater well which exploded in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2010-04">April</TIMEX3> - leading to the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico - has refused to pay its share of the costs so far .
Houston - based Anadarko , which owns 25 % of the Macondo well , was asked to pay $ 272 m -LRB- # 180 m -RRB- by BP .
But an Anadarko spokesman said it was going to withhold payment .
BP said it was ` ` disappointed '' that the firm had ` ` failed to live up to their obligations '' .
` ` Anadarko 's refusal to pay their share will in no way affect BP 's commitment to stop the leak , clean up the spill , and pay all legitimate claims as quickly as possible '' , spokesman Mark Salt added .
He said another firm with a stake in the project , Mitsui Oil Exploration , had also not responded to a request to help pay for the spill .
BP 's bill so far has been more than $ 3.1 bn - and it has agreed to set up a $ 20bn fund to deal with compensation claims and clean - up costs .
But investors remain uncertain over the eventual financial impact of the oil disaster , with estimates from analysts putting the final bill in the tens of billions of dollars .
BP shares remain at around half their value before the disaster and there has been speculation that it may look to sell a stake of the business to outside investors .
Anadarko indicated <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010-06">last month</TIMEX3> that it felt it should not pay for the spill , with its chief executive Jim Hackett issuing a statement that blamed BP for ` ` reckless decisions and actions '' .
He accused the oil giant of failing to ` ` react to several critical warning signs '' as it drilled below the sea floor .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-07-08">Thursday</TIMEX3> BP said its operation to drill a new relief well to stop the Deepwater Horizon leak was ahead of schedule .
The new cap BP intends to install should make a more secure seal over the wellhead .
The company also plans to connect a third containment ship to capture more oil .
The pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ?
