BP reaches key ` milestone ' in halting Gulf oil leak BP CEO Tony Hayward says cutting away the riser was a ` very important step ' Oil company BP says it has cut a ruptured pipe from the leaking Gulf of Mexico oil well , a key step in the latest effort to cap the well .
BP chief Tony Hayward hailed it as an ` ` important milestone '' and said BP could know within the next <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="PT12H">12</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P1D">24 hours</TIMEX3> if the capping effort would succeed .
For <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> , undersea robots are preparing the well - head to receive the cap .
President Barack Obama is to visit the gulf on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010-05-28">Friday</TIMEX3> , his third trip there since the leak began <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-W16">six weeks ago</TIMEX3> .
The White House has been under increasing pressure to show the administration is in control of the response and clean - up efforts .
The federal government will send a $ 69 m -LRB- # 47.1 m -RRB- bill to BP Plc on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-06-03">Thursday</TIMEX3> for expenditure incurred from its response to the spill , the White House said .
Meanwhile , a detailed computer modelling study indicated that oil from the spill might extend along thousands of miles of the Atlantic coast and open ocean as early as <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-SU">this summer</TIMEX3> .
The National Center for Atmospheric Research said once oil entered the ` ` Loop <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Current</TIMEX3> '' , part of the Gulf Stream which sweeps around the Florida panhandle , it would be only weeks before it reached Florida 's Atlantic shores .
The latest stage in BP 's efforts to contain leaking oil has involved lowering a cap onto the failed blowout preventer -LRB- BOP -RRB- valve system on the seabed .
The cap sits on the BOP 's lower marine riser package -LRB- LMRP -RRB- section .
First , the damaged riser - the pipe which takes oil from the well - was cut where it nears the seabed using a remotely - operated shear .
This was completed at <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="1930">1930</TIMEX3> CDT on <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2010-06-01">1 June</TIMEX3> -LRB- <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="TIME" value="2010-06-01T00:30">0030
GMT</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2010-06-02">2 June</TIMEX3> -RRB- .
The next stage was for a diamond wire cutter to saw through the riser close to the LMRP .
The blade got stuck and had to be removed but BP eventually cut through the pipe using giant shears manipulated by undersea robots -LRB-
ROV -RRB- .
After removing the pipe , the cap was lowered onto the LMRP enabling the leaking oil and gas to be funnelled to a drill ship on the surface .
Latest estimates suggest more than half of the leaking oil is <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> being captured .
BACK -LCB- <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> -RCB- of -LCB- total -RCB- NEXT Speaking in Houston , Mr Hayward described the pipe - cutting procedure as ` ` simply the beginning '' .
BP used giant shears manipulated by undersea robots to snip off the end of the pipe , after a diamond - edged saw failed to do the job .
The challenge is <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> to place a containment cap securely over the cut and stop the oil flow .
The company hopes to collect the oil on a surface ship above the well .
` ` Our task is to contain the oil , ultimately to eliminate the leaking well , and most importantly , to clean up all of the oil , defend the shoreline and restore the shoreline where oil does come ashore such that we return it to its original state , '' Mr Hayward said .
BP estimates that the disaster has so far cost the company about $ 990 m in clean - up costs .
Two Democratic senators have written to Mr Hayward urging him to suspend payments to shareholders worth $ 10bn until all costs of the clean - up and compensation are paid out .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2010-06-02">Wednesday</TIMEX3> , BP said it would pay for the construction of six sand barriers off the coast of the US state of Louisiana .
The sand barrier project will push BP 's bill to about $ 1.4 bn .
BP share prices have continued to plummet in trading on the London Stock Exchange , amid news the US justice department has opened several civil and criminal inquiries into the Gulf spill .
Clean - up costs so far : $ 990 m -LRB- # 674 m -RRB- Estimated cost of sand barrier project $ 360 m -LRB- # 244 m -RRB-
Dividend payment <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3> : $ 10.5 bn -LRB- # 7bn -RRB- BP scheduled to make a first - quarter dividend payment to shareholders on <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2010-06-21">21 June</TIMEX3>
At its worst BP saw 34 % wiped off the company 's value Share prices on London Stock Exchange fell from a pre - disaster high of 655.4 pence to 429.75 p Mr Obama has used the disaster to urge Congress to pass a bill to overhaul US energy policy and end tax breaks for oil companies .
The oil began leaking into the Gulf of Mexico on <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">20 April</TIMEX3> when the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig , leased to BP , exploded , killing 11 workers .
BP is drilling two relief wells to permanently stop the leak but they are not expected to be completed until <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="2009-08">August</TIMEX3> .
A ` ` top kill '' procedure , which had been considered the best hope for plugging the leak , failed over <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="2010-W21-WE">the weekend</TIMEX3> .
Engineers were unable to pump enough heavy mud into the well to staunch the oil flow .
The pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ?
