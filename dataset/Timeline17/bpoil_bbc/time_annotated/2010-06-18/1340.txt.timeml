But BP 's chairman Carl - Henric Svanberg has said it remains a ` ` strong company '' despite the ` ` setback '' caused by the spill .
Mr Svanberg has also said that Chief Executive Tony Hayward would be handing over the day - to - day response to BP managing director Bob Dudley .
Mr Hayward was challenged by a US Congressional panel <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-W24" mod="START">earlier this week</TIMEX3> , and faced accusations that the company had ignored dangers when drilling in the Gulf .
James Hackett , chief executive of Anadarko Petroleum , said it was considering ` ` contractual remedies '' for what the company has described as BP 's ` ` gross negligence or wilful misconduct '' over the spill .
` ` The mounting evidence clearly demonstrates that this tragedy was preventable and the direct result of BP 's reckless decisions and actions , '' he said .
Mr Hackett added that Anadarko would have acted differently in the lead - up to the <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-04">April</TIMEX3> blowout .
The company is strong , the company has strong underlying performance - strong cash flow , strong operations '' End
Quote Carl - Henric Svanberg BP chairman BP responded that Anadarko was ` ` refusing to accept responsibility for oil spill removal costs and damages '' , despite a written agreement that the parties would share the costs of any clean - up after a spill .
The oil giant had said on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010-06-16">Wednesday</TIMEX3> that it expected its partners in the well - which include Anadarko and Mitsui , with a 10 % share - to meet their legal obligations .
President Barack Obama has vowed to make BP pay for the damage , and a criminal investigation is underway from which potential fines and damages could run into billions of dollars .
BP has agreed to put aside $ 20bn -LRB- # 13.5 bn -RRB- to compensate victims of the oil spill - and has vowed to help with the clean - up .
A containment cap and another device are capturing some 25,000 barrels of oil <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> - the latest estimates suggest 35,000 - 60 , 000 barrels <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> are spewing out .

At a US congressional panel on <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2010-06-17">Thursday</TIMEX3> , House committee on energy and commerce chairman Henry Waxman said BP 's ` ` complacency '' before the rig explosion had been ` ` astonishing '' .
He accused Mr Hayward of ` ` stonewalling '' for failing to answer his questions .

But Mr Svanberg defended the chief executive , saying the answers would have to wait until a BP inquiry into what happened was completed .
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal on <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2010-06-17">Thursday</TIMEX3> that BP had to pay ` ` a lot of money <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2010">this year</TIMEX3> '' .
` ` Whether the company can digest those expenditures , whether they will lead to the annihilation of the company or its break up is a matter of expediency , '' Mr Medvedev said .
But the BP chairman rejected his company was facing that prospect .
` ` The company is strong , the company has strong underlying performance - strong cash flow , strong operations , '' Mr Svanberg said .
But he added that it was impossible to know the final cost of the spill until it had been stopped .
BP says it will withhold dividends until the end of the year as part of its response to the spill .
