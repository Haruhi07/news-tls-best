US oil spill : BP ` recovering less oil ' than estimated Video from BP appears to show vast quantities of oil still leaking from the well BP has said the amount of oil recovered from a leaking Gulf of Mexico oil well on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2010-05-20">Thursday</TIMEX3> was less than half an earlier estimate .
BP said it had siphoned 2,200 barrels in the 24 - hour period to midnight on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-05-20">Thursday</TIMEX3> , down from an estimate of 5,000 barrels earlier in the day .
The US government has formed a team to develop a more precise estimate of the amount of oil gushing from the well .
BP will attempt to stem the oil flow <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-W21">next week</TIMEX3> , instead of <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-05-23">Sunday</TIMEX3> as hoped .
The oil leak began <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-04" mod="MORE_THAN">more than a month ago</TIMEX3> , when a rig leased by BP exploded .
Heavy rust - coloured oil has washed ashore , threatening wildlife The spill has reached Louisiana and is threatening Florida and Cuba .
Thick , sticky oil is washing on to miles of fragile Louisiana wetlands , with brown , foul - smelling globs coating reeds and grasses .
The crude oil has been flowing since the offshore drilling rig Deepwater Horizon exploded off the coast of Louisiana on <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">20 April</TIMEX3> and sank <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-04-22">two days later</TIMEX3> .
It was widely expected that BP would proceed on <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2010-05-23">Sunday</TIMEX3> with a so - called ` ` top kill '' operation to plug the well , which underwater video shows to be gushing oil and gas .
But BP chief operating officer Doug Suttles on <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2010-05-21">Friday</TIMEX3> said the move would be delayed until <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2010-W21">next week</TIMEX3> , perhaps on <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2010-05-18">Tuesday</TIMEX3> .
Steve Kingstone BBC News , Washington Increasingly , the oil pouring from the Deepwater Horizon spill feels politically toxic .
Under pressure from reporters , White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs pointedly refused to say that President Barack Obama had faith in BP as it struggles to contain the spill .
Mr Gibbs denied that the administration was a mere spectator in the unfolding disaster , but acknowledged that only the oil company possessed the technology to address the emergency 5,000 ft , or 1,500 m , beneath the waves .
In the ` ` top kill '' operation , heavy mud would be injected to stem the oil flow , then cement used to block the well permanently .
The delay was announced on <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2010-05-18">the same day</TIMEX3> the company indicated the amount of oil it has been able to capture from the well was significantly less than initially estimated .
A BP spokesman told Reuters news agency on <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2010-05-21">Friday</TIMEX3> that the company had only siphoned off 2,200 barrels , or 92,400 gallons , in <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DURATION" value="P1D">the 24 hours</TIMEX3> up to midnight on <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2010-05-20">Thursday</TIMEX3> .
` ` The flow changes , it 's not constant , '' BP spokesman John Curry said on <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2010-05-21">Friday</TIMEX3> .
But on <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2010-05-20">Thursday</TIMEX3> , a spokesman had said the company was collecting 5,000 barrels per day or more .
A live video feed showing the oil gushing from the well has been made available by BP after pressure from a US congressman .
It shows a large , flowing plume of oil and gas next to the tube that is carrying some of it to the surface .
It remains unclear exactly how much oil is streaming from the burst well 5,000 ft below the surface , and the US government has formed a multi - agency task force tasked with precisely gauge the amount .
Independent scientists have estimated the flow is as much as 10 times more than the widely distributed figure of 5,000 barrels , or 210,000 gallons , per day .
In the meantime , the Obama administration has asked BP to make public all measurements of the growing leak , air and water quality samples , trajectories of underwater plumes and locations of dispersants .
The request came in a letter to BP chief executive Tony Hayward from Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and Environmental Protection Agency -LRB- EPA -RRB- administrator Lisa Jackson .
It said : ` ` In responding to this oil spill , it is critical that all actions be conducted in a transparent manner , with all data and information related to the spill readily available to the United States government and the American people . ''
The officials said that despite claims by BP it was making efforts to keep the public and the government informed , ` ` those efforts , to date , have fallen short in both their scope and effectiveness '' .
They said it was ` ` imperative that BP promptly '' make public all data on the spill .
Also on <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2010-05-21">Friday</TIMEX3> , Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal demanded the federal government and BP commit to long - term clean up efforts until the tainted beaches and marshlands have been restored to their pre - spill state .
And a top coast guard official in Louisiana speculated that oil had washed ashore because the weather had been too calm for <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DURATION" value="P2D">the past two days</TIMEX3> to use chemical dispersants to mitigate the slick .
An ocean <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> is threatening to carry the oil into the Atlantic The EPA has told BP to use a new dispersant to contain the spill , as fears grow about potential damage from the use of such chemicals .
BP has used a number of dispersants , all approved by the EPA , to try to break up the spill .
It emerged on <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2010-05-19">Wednesday</TIMEX3> that a small part of the slick had entered the so - called Loop <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Current</TIMEX3> , which could take it to Florida and up the eastern US coast .
Florida forecasters said it would be <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DURATION" value="P1W" mod="EQUAL_OR_MORE">at least a week</TIMEX3> before the oil reached waters near the state .
Farther south , US officials have been talking to Cuba about how to respond should the spill reach the island 's northern coast .
The pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ?
