a bastion of defiance - occupies a significant place in the history of modern Syria . \nIn 1982 , then-President Hafez al-Assad , father of Bashar , sent in troops to quell an uprising by the Sunni opposition Muslim Brotherhood . \nTens of thousands were killed and the town flattened . \nThe city , with a population of 800,000 , has seen some of the biggest protests and worst violence in Syria 's 2011 protests . \nIt was slow to join in , but has now become one of the main focuses of the revolt . \nWitnesses and activists told Reuters that tens of people had also been injured after troops opened fire in western Damascus , in the north-eastern city of Hasaka , and in the coastal city of Latakia . \nMobile phone footage purporting to show tanks firing in Hama on Monday was posted on social media websites . \nBut Syrian state television has been showing its own footage , apparently also shot on mobile phones , saying it was taken in Hama on Sunday . \nIt showed some anti-government protesters carrying shotguns , sticks , and knives , and one man wearing an ammunition vest and carrying an AK-47 rifle . \nLater , it reported that a group of `` saboteurs '' had stormed the main courthouse in Hama and set fire to much of the building . \nBut Mr Hamawi told AP that a shell fired from a government tank had caused the fire . \nThe London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 24 people were killed across Syria on Monday , including 10 in Hama . \nThe current crackdown appears aimed at preventing protests from growing during Ramadan , when Muslims visit mosques for prayers after breaking their dawn-to-dusk fast . \nThe government fears the gatherings could then turn into large protests , observers say . \nThe UN Security Council is due to resume the debate on Wednesday . \nCouncil members including Russia , China , India and Brazil have been opposed to a draft resolution circulated by European members that would condemn Damascus . \nDiplomats said significant differences remained over the text and it had not been decided whether the end result should be a resolution or a less weighty council statement . \nRussia and some other countries are pushing for what they say is a more balanced text that would blame both Syrian authorities and the opposition for the violence , but Western nations say the two sides can not be equated . \nBut the latest violence has led to wider acceptance that the council must act . \nAs the council met again on Tuesday , UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon condemned the Syrian president . \n`` This is a totally unacceptable situation , '' Mr Ban said . \n`` I believe that he lost all sense of humanity . '' \nSyria 's anti-government protests , inspired by events in Tunisia and Egypt , first erupted in mid-March after the arrest of a group of teenagers who spray-painted a revolutionary slogan on a wall . \nThe protests soon spread , and the UN says 3,500 people have died in the turmoil - mainly protestors but also members of Syria 's security forces - while thousands more have been injured . \nAlthough the arrest of the teenagers in the southern city of Deraa first prompted people to take to the streets , unrest has since spread to other areas , including Hama , Homs , Latakia , Jisr al-Shughour and Baniyas . \nDemonstrators are demanding greater freedom , an end to corruption , and , increasingly , the ousting of President Bashar al-Assad . \nThe government has responded to the protests with overwhelming military force , sending tanks and troops into towns and cities . \nAmateur video footage shows tanks and snipers firing on unarmed protesters . \nThere may have been an armed element to the uprising from its early days and army deserters have formed the Free Syrian Army . \nSome of the bloodiest events have taken place in the northern town of Jisr al-Shughour . \nIn early June , officials claimed 120 security personnel were killed by armed gangs , however protesters said the dead were shot by troops for refusing to kill demonstrators . \nAs the military moved to take control of the town , thousands fled to neighbouring Turkey , taking refuge in camps . \nAlthough the major cities of Damascus and Aleppo have seen pockets of unrest and some protests , it has not been widespread - due partly to a heavy security presence . \nThere have been rallies in the capital - one with an enormous Syrian flag - in support of President Assad , who still receives the backing of many in Syria 's middle class , business elite and minority groups . \nThe Assad family has been in power for 40 years , with Bashar al-Assad inheriting office in 2000 . \nThe president has opened up the economy , but has continued to jail critics and control the media . \nHe is from the minority Alawite sect - an offshoot of Shia Islam - but the country 's 20 million people are mainly Sunni . \nThe biggest protests have been in Sunni-majority areas . \nThe uprising has cost 3,500 lives , according to the UN and Jordan 's King Abdullah says that President Assad should now step down . \nThe Arab League has suspended Syria 's membership and voted for sanctions . \nThe EU has frozen the assets of Syrian officials , placed an arms embargo on Syria and banned imports of its oil . \nBut fears remain of Syria collapsing into civil war . \nBACK -LCB- current -RCB- of -LCB- total -RCB- NEXT Hopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}

{"id": "121", "time": "2012-01-24", "text": "By Jim Muir BBC News , Beirut The scars of the Syrian conflict are plain to see on the streets of Homs After more than 10 months and 5,000 deaths , an end to the crisis ravaging Syria remains a distant prospect . \nThe only sure thing is that in the coming months , many more people will die violent deaths as the conflict becomes increasingly desperate and ugly . \nThere is no visible way towards a resolution of the struggle between a regime determined to cling to power , and a revolt which long ago passed the point of no return . \nIn the regional domain , the Arab League 's latest proposals have been rejected out of hand by Damascus , and dubbed `` unachievable '' by opposition activists . \nThe new league formula for ending the crisis is likely to become the standard adopted by Syria 's international critics , which will generally increase the outside pressure on Damascus and its allies but is unlikely to produce practical results in the near future . \nThe new Arab plan was modelled on the template fashioned for Yemen by the Gulf states , under which the embattled President Ali Abdullah Saleh left his country on Monday having devolved power to his deputy . \nThe league suggested President Bashar al-Assad should do the same in Syria . \nIts plan called for a dialogue between regime and opposition , formation of a national unity government , election of a constituent assembly , a new constitution , a referendum , and free elections . \nIt was immediately dismissed by the Syrian authorities as part of the `` ongoing conspiracy '' against the country , and a `` blatant interference '' in its affairs . \nArea : 5.25 million square miles Profile compiled by BBC Monitoring President Assad has long since launched what he calls a `` comprehensive reform process '' himself , involving the drafting of a new constitution and the holding of `` free '' multi-party elections in the coming months . \nWhile his plans have no credibility with the opposition or its external supporters , there was no way he was going to abandon them and accept outside diktats . \nThe Arab plan also called for the regime and its opponents to begin a dialogue under League auspices within two weeks . \nThat seems unlikely to happen . \nNeither side wants it . \nThe regime is averse to holding talks other than under its own umbrella . \nMost activists reject talking to a regime which they say has spilled too much blood for reconciliation to be possible . \nThe only part of the Arab League initiative that seems to have survived so far is the observer mission on the ground in Syria , whose mandate was renewed by the Arab foreign ministers for a second month on Sunday . \nThe monitors ' report has not been made public , though their commander , Sudanese General Mohammad al-Dabi , spoke about it at length at a news conference in which he attributed violence to both sides . \nRecourse to the UN is a scenario long espoused by much of the Syrian opposition and many activists on the ground , who want outside intervention to establish safe havens which they could use as launching-pads for ` liberating ' the rest of the country '' He argued that the mission had helped bring down the level of bloodshed , although activists say more than 800 people have been killed by security forces since the observers began deploying in late December . \nThe credibility of the mission - and the unity of purpose of the League effort - have already been diminished , certainly in the eyes of the Syrian regime , by Saudi Arabia 's withdrawal from the observer team . \nThe mission could be terminally jeopardised if the League were to refer the whole affair to the UN Security Council , a step which now seems likely . \nThe man leading the League campaign to end the Syrian crisis , the Prime Minister and Defense Minister of Qatar , Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim Al Thani , said that if Syria failed to adopt the new peace prescription , the League would hand the matter over to the Security Council . \nIn such a situation , Damascus would clearly be tempted to retaliate by asking the observer teams to leave , since the initiative on which their presence was based would have ended . \nSyrian forces are digging in , with no clear way out of the conflict Recourse to the UN is a scenario long espoused by much of the Syrian opposition and many activists on the ground , who want outside intervention to establish safe havens which they could use as launching-pads for `` liberating '' the rest of the country . \nBut there is no clear way forward in the international arena either . \nDivisions there were neatly underlined on Monday , when the European Union announced another round of sanctions against Syrian individuals and companies , while Russia was reported to have agreed to supply Damascus with 36 military jets -LRB- which will , however , have to be paid for -RRB- . \nHow solid the regime 's pillars of support really are , and how much they will be eroded as conditions deteriorate , is hard to predict '' Russia has made it clear that it regards even condemnation of Syria at the UN Security Council , far less the imposition of sanctions or any form of military intervention , as a red line . \nA Council resolution would be needed to cover anything approaching the kind of intervention many of the regime 's opponents would like to see . \nWith Russia and China poised to veto , that is simply not going to happen unless something changes radically . \nSo for the moment at least , Syria 's fate seems to be left largely to the internal dynamics of the conflict . \nThere , the trend in some areas has been increasingly towards an armed insurgency . \nWhole army units have yet to break off , and by and large the capital Damascus and the second city Aleppo remain relatively untroubled , although many people there are reported to feel that the tide is coming in . \nBut in other areas , the impression is of a slow fraying of the regime 's authority and control . \nIn parts of the third city , Homs , and other places such as Idlib province to the north-west , Zabadani in the west near Lebanon , and even some of the townships around Damascus , the control of security forces appears to be nominal , patchy or even non-existent . \nWhether this represents recognition of realities by the regime , or temporary restraint in deference to the presence of the Arab observers , is not clear . \nSince the monitors deployed , the authorities have made some gestures towards implementing the agreement covering their presence . \nThey have released some detainees , allowed some foreign journalists in with constraints . \nThe unrest has now spread to the outskirts of Damascus , where thousands attended the funerals of 12 people killed in the past three days in Douma -LRB- photo : AFP\\/HO\\/LCC -RRB- The mission commander , General al-Dabi , said that security forces had also stopped shooting at demonstrators , though activists dispute that . \nBut the Arab League resolution on Sunday reported that there had been only `` partial and insufficient progress in implementing some of the commitments taken on by the Syrian government '' when it signed the protocol . \nIt is hard to imagine that the monitors , if they stay , will be able , as per their mandate , to verify the regime 's complete compliance with the governing protocol which calls for all armed elements to be withdrawn , all detainees released , and all violence ended . \nMore likely , perhaps , the situation will simply grind on , with more armed attacks by rebels - three Syrian Army brigadiers have been killed in the past week alone - and further repression by regime forces and their militia auxiliaries , the shabbiha , drawn almost entirely from Mr Assad 's Alawite community . \nIt and other minorities such as the Christians have largely continued to support the regime against a revolt which is generally based among the poorer sections of the majority Sunnis . \nFearing a takeover by Islamist militants , some middle-class Sunnis and merchants favored by the regime have also tended to stick with the regime . \nAs the situation has worsened , confessional sentiment has also risen , aggravating fears of a slide into sectarian civil strife and disintegration . \nHow solid the regime 's pillars of support really are , and how much they will be eroded as conditions deteriorate , is hard to predict , especially once economic factors kick in harder as sanctions are tightened . \nBut barring an unpredictable collapse or an internal coup of some kind , the regime seems to have enough hard-core support - and the determination - to defend its grip on power for months to come , if not longer . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}

'' \nHe adds bitterly : `` The West still supports the regime as far as I am concerned . \nThe US could take him out in a week , but they do n't want democracy for us . \nI do n't know why . \nThey want the country to collapse . '' \nOutside , in this small Syrian town , the daily pro-democracy protest is going on . \n`` Men and women together , '' the colonel says , presenting the fact as another testament to the group 's moderation . \nSpeakers make the usual calls to remember the revolution 's martyrs . \nThere are the regular chants against President Bashar al-Assad : `` The Assad family are thieves '' is always popular . \nDespite the colonel 's remarks , the United States does want the Assad regime to fall . \nIt is one of the small ironies of the Syrian uprising that the US and al-Qaeda are on the same side here . \nBoth want the regime 's overthrow . \nStill , the US and other Western governments worry about who might replace Mr Assad . \nThe regime lies all the time . \nThey even lie about the weather . \nAre they telling the truth now that al-Qaeda is behind these bombings ? \nThe bombings are done by the regime '' End Quote Abu Laila Rebel commander The al-Nusra Front emerged earlier this year in customary fashion , with an internet video . \nThe Front for the Defense of the Syrian People , to give them their full title , say they are jihadis who have returned from other wars to fight here . \nThe video was illustrated with shots of tough-looking men training with weapons , somewhere in the desert . \n`` We bring glad tidings to the Islamic nation , '' their spokesman Abu Mohammed al-Gulani , announced on the video . \n`` We are Syrian mujahideen . \nWe are back from the various jihad fronts to restore Allah 's rule upon the Earth and avenge our people 's violated honor and spilled blood . '' \nWe do not know if this video is genuine , but - another irony of Syria - this kind of thing serves the propaganda interests of both the global jihad movement and the Assad regime . \nRegardless , some outside observers believe the men of the Nusra Front do indeed represent the future in Syria . \nAlastair Crooke , a former British intelligence officer who studies Islamist militants , says : `` The numbers were quite small in the beginning , but I think it has grown in this time . '' \nHe goes on : `` The point is that the hard element of the opposition , the armed , the combat-experienced part of the opposition that has come up from Libya or Iraq not only are at the vanguard , but are also pushing out all other forms of opposition . \n`` The only opposition that we are seeing in Syria at the moment is not peaceful protest . \nIt is characterised by extreme use of violence . '' \nThe recent car bombings in Damascus , which killed 55 people , are the result , says the regime . \nThey blame the attacks on Islamists , maybe al-Qaeda . \nThe Americans fear that might be true . \nThe Syrian people have been calling for outside help at their protests One reason to think it is that Syria 's democratic uprising has rescued al-Qaeda from a crisis . \nPeaceful revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt made them look irrelevant . \nNow , perhaps , they are back in the game . \nAnd if so , to what extent ? \nWe met Abu Laila , the commander of a small rebel group outside Homs . \nHe was perfectly suited to Syrian government propaganda . \nHe bore an uncanny resemblance to a young Osama Bin Laden - so much so , he told us , that he was usually asked to leave the room when foreign journalists arrived . \nSitting in a room containing Kalashnikovs , sniper rifles , rocket-propelled grenades and homemade roadside bombs , he says he did , in fact , fight in Iraq . \nThis was a matter of defending his tribe which is found in both countries , he said . \nHe met al-Qaeda people in Iraq , he goes on . \nBut , as it emerges during our conversation , he does not like al-Qaeda . \nHe fears them and what they would do in Syria . \nAnd he does not believe the bombings in Damascus were done by al-Qaeda . \n`` This lie is being used again and again by the regime '' , he said . \n`` The regime lies all the time . \nThey even lie about the weather . \nAre they telling the truth now that al-Qaeda is behind these bombings ? \nThe bombings are done by the regime . '' \nThen he switched from Arabic , to say in stilted English : `` I 'm Muslim , I am not al-Qaeda . \nWe do n't see any men from al-Qaeda in Syria , and we are not al-Qaeda . '' \nMany rebel fighters are deeply pious . \nBut there is a moderate tradition of Islam here at odds with al-Qaeda 's harsh ideology . \nThe suicide attacks and beheadings so familiar from Iraq have not , yet , come to Syria . \nNevertheless , al-Qaeda is working to gain a foothold . \nOne Free Syrian Army officer told me al-Qaeda figures have been visiting , trying to form new alliances . \nThey made a direct approach to a cleric near the town of Qusair . \nMoney , weapons and other support were offered , in return for allegiance to al-Qaeda . \nThey turned him away . \n`` The Syrians did not stand up because they want to declare jihad . \nThey stood up because they want freedom '' End Quote Wissam Tarif Pro-democracy group Avaaz A leading Lebanese militant allied to al-Qaeda fared worse . \nWalid Boustani had tried to declare an Islamic emirate in a Syrian town close to the Lebanese border . \nSome young men in the area joined up , but fell foul of his strict discipline . \nTheir families killed him . \nIn every battle the rebels fight , they are massively outgunned . \nBut Western governments hesitate about arming them , in case the guns end up in radical Islamist hands . \nThe former MI6 man Alastair Crooke worked in Afghanistan during the anti-Soviet jihad . \n`` At that time we also looked aside , '' he said . \n`` We did n't look at who our allies were or what their motives were when they joined in with us in trying to overturn or overthrow the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan . \nWe looked away because confronting communism in Afghanistan was so popular . \n`` And as a result of that , we ended up with groups that were highly dangerous . \nWe ended up with 9\\/11 and with two decades of the war on terror and bombs in London . '' \nWissam Tarif , of the pro-democracy group Avaaz , disagrees . \nThe street protest still matters much more to the outcome in Syria than the armed groups . \nAnd , he says , the demonstrators want freedom , not another kind of dictatorship . \n`` The Syrians did not stand up because they want to declare jihad , '' he said . \n`` They stood up because they want freedom , and I do n't think the Muslim Brothers or the Salafis or any Islamist model can offer them the freedom they have been fighting for for 14 months . \nThat 's another fiction and an unjustified fear from the West . '' \nDemocracy is emphatically not what al-Qaeda is fighting for . \nThe jihadis do not much like the Free Syrian Army , either , since they are fighting under the banner of democracy - rather than Sharia . \nStill , more than a year into the uprising , people are desperate for help from anywhere . \nA sign at this demonstration we attended this week said : `` If you do n't help us , we will die . '' \nOne of the most senior Free Syrian Army officers inside Syria , Col Kasim Saad Eddine , stressed to me that his troops were fighting for democracy , not Sharia . \nBut he said that if the West did not come to their aid , he worried the jihadis would find an opening . \n`` I tell the UN and the UN Security Council , the Syrian people ca n't take it anymore , '' he said . \n`` Our children killed ; our women raped ; our houses destroyed . \nIf no-one helps us , we will turn to the devil himself . '' \nIf al-Qaeda is here , and part of this struggle , the numbers are probably very small . \nWe did not meet their supporters or see their influence in many months of traveling with rebel fighters . \nBut that could change the longer this goes on . \nThe jihadists thrive on chaos . \nAnd they will find plenty of that in Syria . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}

'' \nIn his unscripted speech on the square , the president returned yet again to his favorite theme : Syria is threatened by a foreign conspiracy that is in league with `` terrorists '' within the country . \nHe is talking not only of Western powers such as the United States , which this week accused him of `` cynicism , '' but also of Arab states such as Qatar , one of the chief movers behind the Arab League monitoring mission being sent to Syria . \nQatar has now suggested the mission is so ineffective in stopping the violence that it should be withdrawn . \nAnti-government protests are moving ever closer to the city center Speaking anonymously - because the terms of their engagement forbid them talking to the media - some of the monitors tell me they are more afraid of going into pro-government areas than into opposition strongholds . \nCrowds have vented their anger on what they see as the monitors ' interference in Syrian affairs . \nAnd in the car park of the Sheraton Hotel , one of their bases , you can see the evidence of that anger - Arab League vehicles with windows smashed and plastered with stickers of Mr Assad , the bumpers caved in and tyres let down . \nAt the Foreign Ministry , spokesman Jihad Makdissi tells me that should not have happened . \nPeople have now been told , he says , to let the monitors work freely . \nAnd he is also keen to stress that the president 's talk of a conspiracy was `` for internal consumption '' . \nSyria wants the mission to continue , he says . \nBut on Thursday another 18 deaths were reported in the continuing struggle between demonstrators and security forces - bringing to more than 400 the number killed since the mission began in late December . \nMore than 5,000 civilians have been killed , says the UN More than 400 killed since start of Arab League mission on 26 December UN denied access to Syria Information gathered from NGOs , sources in Syria and Syrians who have fled Vast majority of casualties were unarmed , but the figure may include armed defectors Tally does not include serving members of the security forces In the meantime , Mr Assad continues to insist that he wants dialogue with opposition forces , and he has set out what he says is a timetable for democratic reforms . \nBut he has been saying the same thing for months , without any sign of his government reaching out even to those elements of the highly-fractured opposition that would be prepared to talk to him . \nIt is a stalemate , but a dangerous one in which more and more protesters , who once insisted demonstrations must be peaceful , now believe some of their number should carry guns - not to attack the security forces , but at least to defend themselves against attack . \n`` The regime is launched down a cul-de-sac '' , one Western diplomat tells me . \nAnd many fear that at the end of it will be even more violence . \nWatch Tim Whewell 's full report from Damascus on Newsnight at 10.30 pm on BBC Two on Friday 13 January 2012 . \n"}
{"id": "212", "time": "2012-06-04", "text": "By PJ Crowley Former US Assistant Secretary of State US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Russia must be at the table for a political transition in Syria to occur Syria may be at a tipping point , as UN Special Envoy Kofi Annan cautioned early last week , following the Houla tragedy . \nBut in his discussions with European leaders , which continue this week , newly restored Russian President Vladimir Putin made clear Houla would not be a pivot-point for Russian policy or a catalysing moment for the international community . \nUnlike Tunisia , Egypt , Libya and Yemen , which were resolved in days , weeks or months , events in Syria will grind on for months and perhaps longer . \nSyrian President Bashar al-Assad may be on his `` last legs '' , as US Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice suggested , but his demise will , more likely than not , be a long , painful process . \nThis transition , already a tragedy , will unfold in slow-motion . \nCongresswoman Jane Harman says there is `` little value '' in the Syria peace plan There was some anticipation that Houla - where an estimated 108 people were killed , many executed - would become for Syria what Srebrenica was for Bosnia . \nAfter the massacre of 8,000 men and boys in Srebrenica in July 1995 an ineffectual international response turned far more intense . \nWithin six months , a political agreement at Dayton , Ohio , ended the conflict and included a military intervention that enforced it . \nBut the present situation could resemble not 1995 but 1993 , when the conflict was still accelerating . \nInternational monitoring was ineffective , peace plans were developed and ignored and the international community , particularly the United States , was not yet sufficiently invested to stop it . \nResidents of Taldou village in the Houla region say that after an anti-government protest on 25 May , the army began an 18-hour bombardment Some accounts say rebel fighters attacked the military position from where shellfire was coming Unconfirmed reports say pro-government shabiha militia entered Taldou , killing people at home , shooting them in the head or cutting their throats UN observers say at least 108 people died , including 49 children and 34 women . \nNo more than 20 appeared to have been killed by shellfire A government investigation blames armed groups seeking to trigger foreign military intervention The first Bush administration hesitated to get significantly involved in the violent dissolution of the former Yugoslavia - former Secretary of State James Baker famously said : `` We do n't have a dog in this fight . '' \nWashington sought to avoid a public confrontation with Moscow as it managed the emerging `` new world order '' that would soon see the Soviet Union itself disappear . \nFormer US President Bill Clinton was elected to fix more urgent challenges at home - `` It 's the economy , stupid '' - not abroad . \nSomalia reinforced Clinton 's instinct to keep Bosnia at arm 's length . \nBut after the failure to intercede in Rwanda , confronted with the potential genocide in the Balkans , the United States became fully engaged . \nPropelled by his success in Bosnia , Mr Clinton devoted much of his second term to conflict resolution from the Middle East and Northern Ireland to Africa and Asia . \nIf Mr Bush and Mr Clinton felt a tail-wind as the United States emerged from the Cold War with unprecedented power , President Barack Obama felt a headwind from the squandering of that power during the Iraq War and the global economic crisis . \nThe Obama administration has clearly , if somewhat inconsistently -LRB- much firmer with dictators than monarchs -RRB- supported the dramatic political developments that have come with the Arab Awakening . \nBut , while broadly engaged politically , it has presumed from the outset that the US could only affect regional change on the margins . \nFor understandable reasons , Mr Obama has been far more focused on ending wars than starting them . \nThe exception , of course , is Libya , although the Obama administration went to great lengths to downplay its role , even declining to term the Nato intervention as `` hostilities '' for domestic legal and political reasons . \nYet , Libya looms large on all sides of the Syria debate . \nFor the Syrians , it set high expectations that the international community would provide protection as they mounted a political challenge to the Assad regime . \nVladimir Putin has indicated Houla was not a turning point for Russia 's position on Syria Nato , backed by an Arab League request and UN Security Council resolution , not only protected the Libyan people but also directly supported the rebel advance that eventually toppled Muammar Gaddafi 's regime . \nIf Libya , why not Syria The United States rejects the idea that Libya set a precedent for Syria , preferring to view all Middle East transitions on a case-by-case basis . \nIt remains sceptical of what can be accomplished in Syria militarily at an acceptable cost , particularly given Russian and Iranian political , economic and military support . \nThe ideal conditions that enabled the Libyan intervention - Arab League and UN support , and Nato and international participation - are now considered necessary pre-requisites for action in Syria . \nMaybe Syria , if and when For its part , Europe is now engaged in an existential economic struggle centred for the moment around Greece , but potentially affecting other countries as well . \nAnd in the eight months since Gaddafi 's death , two leaders who helped launch Nato 's Libya operation - France 's Nicholas Sarkozy and Italy 's Silvio Berlusconi - are no longer in office . \nProcess led by Syrian parties working with international envoy 2 . \nEnd to violence by all sides ; army troops to stop using heavy weapons and withdraw to barracks 3 . \nParties to allow humanitarian aid 4 . \nAuthorities to free detainees 5 . \nAuthorities to ensure freedom of movement for journalists 6 . \nAuthorities to allow peaceful demonstrations Europe is sympathetic to Syria 's plight , but has its hands full . \nAnother leader who allowed Libya to happen , Dmitry Medvedev , is now Russia 's prime minister and no longer responsible for international affairs . \nMr Putin , who is , will block aggressive international action that threatens the status quo and Russia 's already declining influence -LRB- not to mention market share -RRB- in the region . \nVoicing some support for a Yemen-style solution , Russia will seek to preserve the Syrian regime with or without Assad and is willing to bear whatever political costs the United States , Europe and the Gulf states can impose at present . \nGiven significant divisions within the Arab League , those costs are viewed as manageable . \nOver the weekend US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , while criticising Russia 's ongoing support of the Assad regime , reiterated that Russia must be at the table for a political transition to occur . \nNow back in the game , Mr Putin appears to be in no hurry to deal . \nWhether or not this is good for Russia , it is tragic for the Syrian people . \nPJ Crowley is a former US Assistant Secretary of State in the administration of President Barack Obama . \n"}

'' \nMr Van Rompuy 's call came as the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights -LRB- SOHR -RRB- said it had confirmed with local doctors that at least 80 soldiers had been killed in clashes with Free Syrian Army fighters over the weekend . \nHerman Van Rompuy said the EU and Russia both back the Annan plan At least 19 soldiers , eight rebels and 19 civilians were killed in violence on Sunday , the UK-based group added . \nAnother 89 were killed on Saturday , including 57 soldiers , which the SOHR said was the largest number of fatalities the military had suffered in a single day since the start of the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad in March 2011 . \nThe reports could not be independently confirmed . \nSOHR head Sami Abdul Rahman told AFP news agency that there had been a sharp increase in the number of clashes between the army and rebels over the weekend . \n`` Troops are vulnerable to heavy losses because they are not trained for street battles and are therefore exposed to attacks , '' he said . \n`` What exacerbates those losses is that the army is fighting locals of those towns and villages ... who know the area inside and out and enjoy public support , '' he added . \nMr Abdul Rahman said rebels had targeted military vehicles advancing on towns and villages , firing automatic weapons and throwing grenades . \nOvernight , there were clashes in the Idlib province , as security forces used tanks , rocket launchers and artillery to bombard the towns of Kafr Nabal , Maarat al-Numan , Ariha and Rama , according to the main opposition coalition , the Syrian National Council . \nPresident Assad : `` Our anger -LRB- at the Houla massacre -RRB- was indescribable '' The SOHR said at least two rebels were killed in Kafr Nabal , while two others died in separate incidents in the Damascus suburbs of Jubar and Douma . \nOn Sunday , President Assad told parliament that Syria was facing not an internal crisis but an external war , waged against it because of its support for resistance to Israel . \nIn his first public comment on the massacre at Houla , in which 108 people were killed on 25 May , Mr Assad said that even `` monsters '' would not have carried out such an act and it should prompt an end to bloodshed . \nSurvivors and human rights groups blamed the army and shabiha militiamen allied to the government for the deaths . \nMr Assad said the door remained open for dialogue with opposition forces . \nHe excluded those engaged in `` terrorist acts '' or taking orders from abroad . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}

{"id": "236", "time": "2012-02-02", "text": "By PJ Crowley Former US Assistant Secretary of State The narratives used were quite familiar : defending the status quo , supporting the aspirations for revolutionary reform and demanding responsible governance in accordance with international norms . \nBut the key players - the United States , Russia and the Arab League - had all traded places . \nAs if in the midst of a game of musical chairs , they were all advancing policy prescriptions markedly different than those held in previous decades , even in previous months . \nDuring most of the Cold War the United States was , by and large , the staunch defender of the status quo and supported existing governments regardless of how autocratic , corrupt or unpopular , as long as they sided with the `` free '' world . \nAll options were binary . \nThe watchword was stability . \nKnowns trumped unknowns , as Donald Rumsfeld might say , whether known or not . \nThe US pushed political transformations everywhere else . \nBut in the Middle East there were always more compelling priorities : the need for stable governments to offset revolutionary Iran ; fears of weapons of mass destruction -LRB- Iraq was about democracy only when the WMD went missing -RRB- ; energy markets to reassure ; and then terrorism to contain . \nReform , let alone genuine democracy , was an aspiration , but would follow other developments , such as Middle East peace . \nHillary Clinton has spoken about the importance of respecting the aspirations of the Syrian people To its credit , as the dictatorial dominos wobbled across the region , there was a brief hesitation and then a dramatic shift . \nUS policy left its traditional walled compound , moved to the street and embraced the unknown -LRB- except in Bahrain where , because of Iran , the binary logic still holds -RRB- . \nNow Russia is the great defender of the status quo . \nOne reason for that is commercial : Russia resents the fact that every time the UN is asked to take action , it is asked to pay the piper , especially the forfeiture of lucrative contracts involving Moscow 's shrinking armaments industry . \nRussia has been losing market share and influence in the Middle East since the end of the Cold War , notably in Iran -LRB- where Russia has actually been responsive to nuclear and weapons concerns -RRB- , Iraq -LRB- now buying American -RRB- , and Libya -LRB- which will undoubtedly shop in the future in Europe or the United States -RRB- . \nSyria is a last bastion and Moscow has drawn its line in the sand . \nMoscow has been an Assad family friend for decades and a major investor in Syria . \nOutgoing Russian President Dmitry Medvedev signed a lucrative arms deal with Syria in 2010 . \nHence , Russia has made it clear it will run cover for its valued client , for as long as it can , blocking significant action beyond diplomatic rhetoric . \nFriends do n't let friends get overthrown , especially after Libya . \nAs Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said this week from Australia , `` Regime change is not our profession . '' \nRussia was caught off guard in March 2011 by the unprecedented and bold Arab League call for a humanitarian intervention to protect the Libyan people . \nExperts fear the violence in Syria may tip into a protracted struggle or civil war Like China , it is no fan of the concept of a `` responsibility to protect '' and resists any notion that the international community can intervene in the sovereign affairs of nation states . \nIf Libya is a model of effective multilateral action , Russia will exercise its veto if necessary to ensure it does n't happen again - or at least any time soon . \nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton spoke at the UN this week about the aspirations of the Syrian people . \n`` Syria belongs to 23 million people , '' she said , `` not to one man or his family . '' \nRussia does not have an aspirational foreign policy . \nIts real focus right now is the political fortunes of Vladimir Putin , not Bashar al-Assad . \nUnexpected and unwelcome protests in Russia have challenged the legitimacy of Mr Putin 's arranged plan to return to the presidency for presumably another 12 years . \nAny UN resolution that appears to advocate term limits , much less regime change , will strike Russia too close to home . \nOf all the positional shifts , arguably the most remarkable is that of the Arab League , historically a steadfast supporter of non-interference in the internal affairs of other states , most notably its fellow members . \nThe call for Mr Assad to give way is out of character , but reflects the pressure these conservative governments feel to respond in a meaningful way to the clear regional call for change . \nFor the Arab League , Libya was a relatively easy lift - no-one liked Gaddafi and his antics . \nLibya was always a fringe regional player . \nSyria , on the other hand , is part of the region 's center . \nOne factor behind the Arab League 's shift is personal : Bashar al-Assad has ignored the advice of his peers repeatedly over the past several months , declining to present even the pretence of co-operation with the Arab League observer mission . \nAnother consideration is containment . \nThe expanding influence of Iran , with Syria 's help , is a major concern among the Sunni-dominated governments in the neighborhood . \nWhether Syria is yet a civil war , it is already a proxy war in the struggle between Iran and Saudi Arabia for ascendancy in the Gulf . \nA final factor is dynamic of the Arab awakening . \nThe Arab League , like the US , has begrudgingly recognized that the status quo is unsustainable . \nAll governments have taken some steps - modest in most cases - towards reform . \nRegional leaders are acutely aware of Mr Assad 's boast a year ago that the Arab Spring wo n't visit Syria . \nThey all know deep down that this is fundamentally not about foreign conspiracies . \nThey recognize in some way that they can no longer take their legitimacy to govern for granted . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}

'' \nIt had backed the Arab League observer mission and had persuaded the Syrian authorities to accept it . \nBut , he went on , Russia was not going to accept any resolutions that might open the way to foreign intervention or that would pre-determine the political outcome in Syria . \nMr Lavrov was clearly sceptical about what any UN resolution might achieve . \n`` What was the West 's game plan ? '' \nIf the violence continued , he argued , would you simply go back to the UN for another resolution ? \nThis was simply `` not a serious policy '' . \nIf the draft resolution did not apply equivalent restrictions on all parties - for the Russians that means the `` armed groups '' who they believe are fomenting the violence as much as the Syrian government - it was going to be unacceptable to Moscow . \nSimilarly , if it referred in any way to the Arab League peace plan which involves President Assad stepping aside according to a tight schedule , then this too was unacceptable to the Russians , as was anything that they believe might pre-determine the outcome in Syria . \nContrast all this with the Western view and the context of Saturday 's talks - reports of hundreds killed by Syrian government artillery in Homs . \nThe fact that the death toll was significantly scaled down by the evening does little to alter the horror of the events there . \nWestern leaders believed the Syrian government 's escalation of the violence required a prompt and unanimous condemnation from the international community . \nRussia fully supports the rights of the Syrian people for a better life . \nWe are not friends or allies of President Assad '' End Quote Sergei Lavrov Russian Foreign Minister But the broader context matters too . \nIn general terms , the West is far more enthusiastic than the Russians about the upheavals in the Middle East . \nMoscow has welcomed the advent of the Arab Spring in cautious terms , concerned by instability and the potential overthrow of established diplomatic patterns . \nIn the West there has been an altogether more jubilant tone . \nSyria is seen as the next outdated regime to fall and its departure would be a blow to Iran . \nAfter hoping that President Assad might deliver reform , he has turned his guns on his own people and the consensus in the West , along with the Arab League , is that he must go . \nSo where does diplomacy go from here ? \nThe sense of anger in Western diplomatic circles is palpable , and that is bound to have an impact on broader relations with Moscow . \n`` The Russians and Chinese have put themselves on the wrong side of history , and they will regret it , '' said veteran US Senator John McCain who is leading a Congressional delegation to the Munich conference . \n`` Did n't Mr Lavrov though have a point ? '' \n`` A UN resolution is not going to change President Assad 's approach ? '' \n`` No '' he said , such resolutions mattered . \n`` Secretary Clinton had gone the extra mile with Mr Lavrov here in Munich . \nShe was willing to make changes to the resolution . \nIt was n't set in concrete , '' he said . \n`` But Mr Lavrov wanted to gut the resolution , it 's as simple as that . '' \nWestern diplomats insist that the quest for a UN resolution condemning Syria will continue . \nMr Lavrov is heading to Damascus for some bilateral diplomacy of his own . \nWhat message will he carry with him to the Syrian capital ? \nRussia of course does not want to lose an ally , but it is undoubtedly in an uncomfortable position . \nIt wants any new Syria that may emerge to maintain its alliance with Moscow . \nBut there was perhaps just a hint of Moscow 's thinking in Mr Lavrov 's comments here in Munich . \n`` Russia fully supports the rights of the Syrian people for a better life . \nWe are not friends or allies of President Assad , '' he said . \nHe said it again a few moments later : `` We do n't have any special concern for President Assad . '' \nThat is one straw in the wind , though . \nWith the Assad regime struggling for its survival , Moscow may find that its efforts to manage regime change in Syria is just as fruitless as the diplomatic pressures coming from the West and the Arab League . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}
{"id": "292", "time": "2012-02-05", "text": "By Barbara Plett BBC UN correspondent The US accused Russia and China of shameful intransigence after the vote The UN resolution supporting an Arab League peace plan was the most determined effort so far by the Security Council to try and respond to the crisis in Syria . \nIt now lies in tatters after the double veto by Russia and China . \nThe scale of the defeat was registered in the gloom on the faces of Western and Arab envoys , and in the bitter exchanges in the council after the vote . \nUsing words like `` disgusted '' and `` appalled '' , Western diplomats accused Russia and China of holding the council hostage , and of complicity in the policy of repression carried out by the regime of President Bashar al-Assad . \nThe disappointment was all the deeper because this was the second double veto on Syria , and because this time agreement had seemed possible . \nThe resolution had the support of the 13 other council members and of the group representing the region - the Arab League . \nIn intense negotiations diplomats seem to have met many of the Russian objections : they took out reference to anything that might have suggested support for sanctions or an arms embargo , and added assurances that the resolution could not be used to authorise military intervention or regime change . \nThey removed explicit reference to the elements of the Arab peace plan - particularly a timetable spelling out a process for Mr Assad to hand powers to a deputy who would oversee preparations for new elections . \nAlthough they insisted that support for the plan itself was a red line . \nDespite all of this the Russians vetoed . \nIn broad terms , their decision was colored by the strategic and commercial interests they have invested in a decades-long alliance with the Assad regime , and by their policy of non-intervention in the affairs of a sovereign state . \nBut there were two other reasons why they refused to accept this specific resolution . \nFirst of all , they were never happy with the way it came about . \nThey supported the Arab League observer mission despatched to Syria in December , but they did n't think its conclusions warranted the subsequent league decision to promote a political process that in essence saw Mr Assad step aside . \nRather , the Russians suspected that the observer mission had been hijacked by Qatar and Saudi Arabia -LRB- countries hostile to Syria -RRB- backed by Western powers , and that their proposal was a thinly disguised attempt at regime change . \nBecause the Russians thought that was the real intention , it was always going to be very difficult to get their full support for the Arab plan , especially as the Syrian government had rejected it . \nEven in the last amendments they put forward , they were trying to weaken its elements , `` taking account '' of the timetable for political transition , rather than adhering to it . \nSecondly , the Russians highlight the element of armed conflict in the violence , rather than simply focusing on government repression of civilians . \nThey say the Security Council should also be making demands of the armed opposition , not just the regime , or it will be taking sides in a civil war . \nAgain , their last minute amendments reflected this view , declaring , for example , that any military withdrawal from cities and towns be done in conjunction with an end to rebel attacks . \nThis was just too much of a concession for the West to accept , especially on a day when government forces had been relentlessly shelling the city of Homs . \nThe British ambassador to the UN , Mark Lyall Grant , has promised to bring the Arab League plan back to the council if the bloodshed continues , although there is little to suggest the Russians would not again reject it for all the reasons they have cited . \nMore likely is that diplomatic efforts will run along different and possibly opposing tracks . \nWestern nations have said they will continue strong support for the Arab peace plan , working with the Arab League to pressure and isolate the Assad regime . \nRussia has also announced its own separate initiative . \nOn Tuesday Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and the head of Russia 's foreign intelligence service will go to Damascus . \nPeople will be waiting to see whether the Russians can succeed where the world has failed - in getting Mr Assad to sign on to a political transition plan that would end the conflict . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}

{"id": "230", "time": "2011-12-16", "text": "By Bridget Kendall Diplomatic correspondent , BBC News Russia has an old ally in Syria , but the political pressure is building to distance itself Syria has provided Russia with a close military ally in the heart of the Arab world since Soviet times . \nAnd up until recently , it has suited Moscow 's world view to stay friends with President Bashar al-Assad . \nIt fits Russia 's profile of itself as an independent Eurasian world power with its own priorities . \nThe spat between Russia and Nato over Georgia in 2008 accentuated the trend , prompting Vladimir Putin to announce he was reactivating closer links with old Soviet friends -LRB- Nicaragua and Venezuela in Central and Latin America , and Syria and Algeria in the Arab world -RRB- . \nAt the United Nations Security Council , Russia has repeatedly argued that its opposition to UN sanctions against Syria is consistent with a broader refusal to back outside interference in sovereign states , and an insistence that diplomacy is always preferable to coercion . \nThat position has hardened in the last decade or so , following the West 's interventions in Kosovo , Iraq and Libya . \nIndeed , Nato 's action in Libya is regularly cited by Russia as the main reason it blocked the UN resolution on Syria in October - precisely because , Moscow said , it feared the start of a slippery slope towards military action . \nRussia may want to proclaim its independence from the West , but it does not want to look isolated either '' Staying loyal to President Assad also reflects another Russian instinct : that stability is usually preferable to turbulence . \nAll the various-coloured revolutions in former Soviet republics which preceded the Arab Spring prompted wariness or downright hostility from Mr Putin 's government . \nAnd Russia is highly sensitive to the geography of the crisis and Syria 's relative proximity to its own unstable Muslim areas : if a full-blown civil war in Syria were to destabilise the entire region , Moscow 's nightmare would be to see trouble spilling over into the North Caucasus on Russia 's side of the border . \nBut as often with Russian foreign policy , one has to distinguish between posture and practicalities . \nRussia may want to proclaim its independence from the West , but it does not want to look isolated either . \nRemember what happened with Libya . \nOnce it became clear that Col Muammar Gaddafi 's days in power were numbered and other non-Western actors like Turkey and major Arab countries were losing patience , Russia too echoed the call that he should go . \nSo far Moscow has not done that with President Assad , though it has warned that the Syrian regime will not survive if it can not reform itself . \nBut in recent days the political pressure to do something at the United Nations has been mounting . \nA new UN report on human rights abuses in Syria asserted that the civilian death toll had risen to more than 5,000 . \nThe UN Human Rights Commissioner called for the Assad regime to be referred to the International Criminal Court . \nAnd Russia , seemingly , was stung by accusations that its intransigence was blocking UN action . \nFor Russia , a UN resolution could be the top of a slippery slope to military action - like in Libya It too wants to be seen to `` uphold human rights '' in Syria and criticise a `` disproportionate use of force by the Syrian authorities '' , as the new Russian UN text puts it - even if the same draft is also careful to insist on equivalence , and claim that `` extremists '' among the Syrian opposition are also responsible for the bloodshed . \nBesides this , the lessons of `` regime fall '' in Iraq and Libya must also be concentrating minds in Moscow about how best to protect its military and financial interests in Syria . \nRussia is a major arms supplier . \nIt has energy projects to protect in Syria and naval interests too : it would like to see the Syrian port of Tartus once again serve as a base for Russian ships as it did in Soviet times . \nAll good reasons to support the status quo , but only of course while President Assad remains a viable option . \nYet at a certain point , Moscow must know that it might have to abandon its long-time ally . \nOnce it makes the assessment that Mr Assad and his Alawite officers , some of them trained in Russian military academies , are likely to lose power , then Moscow needs to find a way to shift allegiances . \nHence the updated draft at the UN . \nHence - having ruled out sanctions altogether - the hint of a shift in the Russian foreign minister 's recent comments that `` if sanctions could help stop violence and maintain stability ... we would be the most decisive supporters '' . \nAnd hence , having criticised the Arab League a few weeks ago for suspending Syria 's membership , Russia 's current invocation of the Arab League as part of a possible solution , saying its efforts to encourage dialogue and deploy a monitoring mission in Syria should be supported . \nWhere this will lead Russian policy on Syria ? \nWho knows - especially if the Arab League backs not intervention but the establishment of safe havens for fleeing opposition activists . \nOne thing is clear : principle is all very well , but Russia 's priority may well be its interests , and how to secure whatever it can salvage for the longer term . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}

{"id": "260", "time": "2012-04-24", "text": "Syria crisis : Can UN mission succeed ? \nBy Jim Muir BBC News , Beirut The UN mission is seen by many as the last throw of the dice for a political solution in Syria Will the new acronym UNSMIS - the UN Supervision Mission in Syria - pass into the Middle East 's lexicon and take up its place alongside those of other deployments , such as UNTSO and Unifil , which have for decades been helping keep some of the region 's potential flashpoints from exploding ? \nOr will the mission collapse and withdraw in disarray , unable to carry out its task of monitoring compliance with an already highly compromised ceasefire , and with chief envoy Kofi Annan 's six-point plan for stabilising the country and fostering dialogue on its future ? \nThe Americans and others are clearly sceptical , and have already warned that their support for a renewal of the mission , when its initial mandate expires in three months ' time , should not be taken for granted . \nIt is certainly unlike any other peacekeeping mission the UN has embarked on in the Middle East , and possibly anywhere else . \nNormally it is a case of monitoring respect of a formal truce involving states , not trying to ensure compliance with a work-in-progress peace plan in a situation which in some ways resembles a civil war . \nSyrian-led political process to address the aspirations and concerns of the Syrian people 2 . \nUN-supervised cessation of armed violence in all its forms by all parties to protect civilians 3 . \nAll parties to ensure provision of humanitarian assistance to all areas affected by the fighting , and implement a daily two-hour humanitarian pause 4 . \nAuthorities to intensify the pace and scale of release of arbitrarily detained persons 5 . \nAuthorities to ensure freedom of movement throughout the country for journalists 6 . \nAuthorities to respect freedom of association and the right to demonstrate peacefully In other words , the observers are being expected to help create the peace they are supposed to be monitoring . \nMr Annan himself has said the Security Council 's decision to deploy 300 unarmed UN monitors is `` a pivotal moment in the stabilisation of the country '' . \nThat is certainly what he hopes : that the presence of the monitors will in itself help to bring the situation under control , by `` changing the political dynamics on the ground '' , as his spokesman Ahmad Fawzi put it . \nIt is clearly a gamble , a last throw of the dice for a political solution to the Syrian crisis . \nIt is hard to imagine any other peace project being more balanced and reasonable than the Annan plan , or garnering the unanimous international support that he has marshalled behind it . \nSo if this does not work , nothing will . \nIt will be back to a trial of strength on the ground , with predictably drastic consequences . \nDespite the obvious imperfections of the ceasefire , to put it mildly , the prognosis for the observer mission is not totally black . \nSyrian troops were supposed to have withdrawn from population centres by 10 April Violence has flared and sputtered in many places . \nBut overall the levels of hostilities and the casualty figures are below pre-ceasefire averages . \nThe tiny number of observers already deployed as the advance party have covered a surprising amount of ground , especially considering that they are also engaged in setting up liaison mechanisms with both sides and organising logistics for the full deployment . \nThere have been several instances in the past few days - in Hama and Douma , for example - where visits by the monitors have taken place peacefully , only for violence to erupt again the next day . \nIn both instances , the monitors returned later to verify what had happened . \nBut in Homs , where two observers are now permanently stationed , the casualty figures are no longer topping the nationwide lists as they did day after day before the monitors arrived . \nThe heavy weapons which wrought such carnage seem to have been more or less silenced there . \nSo the deployment of the full 300-strong contingent over the coming weeks should have a considerable impact . \nThey will obviously split down into small groups , and - presuming they get the freedom of access and mobility the UN has demanded and been promised - they should be able to move swiftly from one trouble-spot to another as required . \nTheir task is not just to monitor compliance with the truce , but to ensure that all clauses of the Annan plan are fully implemented . \nMost crucially , that means verifying regime compliance with the provision that it must withdraw its troops , tanks and heavy weapons from population centres . \nAccording to Mr Fawzi , Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallim has informed Mr Annan in writing two days ago that those provisions have already been carried out - despite much evidence to the contrary . \nBut the commitment is there , which means that confronting the authorities with evidence of breaches should in theory lead to their swift correction . \nMuch will depend not just on the regime 's intentions , but on those of the various armed opposition groups . \nOnce fully deployed , the UNSMIS monitors should be able to gauge the validity of the regime 's assertions that the post-truce violence has been provoked by the rebels - a contention strongly backed by Russia . \nIf either side , or both , decides to keep up the violence , the observers might ultimately face no choice but to withdraw , especially if the unarmed monitors start taking casualties . \nBut if the regime is clearly seen to be to blame , and consistently out of compliance with agreements it has signed , the consequences would be considerable . \nRussia , China and others who have protected Syria from punitive action by the Security Council would find themselves perhaps unable to continue doing so . \nIt is doubtful that Damascus can go it alone , especially without Russia . \nIf the Russians themselves remain as committed to the Annan plan as they say they are , and the rebel side complies , the regime may have no choice but to implement steps - such as freeing all detainees and allowing demonstrations to be held unhindered - that would threaten its grip on much of the country and weaken its position in any settlement dialogue . \nSome Arab analysts in touch with regime thinking believe it does understand that there will be a price to be paid for survival in any form - perhaps the formation of a government with opposition figures prominent in it . \nBut many obstacles will have to be overcome on the ground before events reach anywhere near that point . \nAnd given the fate of the ceasefire so far , optimism is in short supply . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}

'' \n-LRB- The Syrian authorities -RRB- are claiming that this has happened , '' he said , quoted by Reuters news agency . \n`` Satellite imagery , however , and credible reports show that this has not fully happened , so this is unacceptable , and joint special envoy Kofi Annan will be saying this to the Security Council today -LRB- Tuesday -RRB- when he addresses them in closed session .

'' \nUN political chief B Lynn Pascoe added that `` human rights violations are still perpetrated with impunity '' . \nOn Monday , UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon again insisted that Syria `` should provide full protection of our monitors and ensure their freedom of access , freedom of movement '' . \nThe UN says about 9,000 people have died since pro-democracy protests began in March 2011 . \nIn February , the Syrian government put the death toll at 3,838 - 2,493 civilians and 1,345 security forces personnel . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}

{"id": "194", "time": "2012-03-02", "text": "Robin Lustig | 16:21 UK time , Friday , 2 March 2012 Here 's a question for you to ponder over the weekend : if international military forces were to intervene in Syria , how likely do you think it is that they would be able to create a sustainable solution to the crisis ? \nThe question was asked in an interview this week by the NATO secretary-general Anders Fogh Rasmussen -- and I think it 's a good one . \nGideon Rachman , in a thoughtful column in the Financial Times , put it this way : `` Is it possible that , in intervening to stop one evil , we will create a greater evil in the future ? '' \nIf you or I had been trapped in the hell that was Homs over the past month , I 'm sure we would have been begging for foreign intervention , anything to bring to an end a bombardment that has killed countless innocent people , as well as dozens , if not hundreds , of anti-Assad fighters . \nBut if you or I were an Iraqi who had lived through the hell that followed the US-led invasion of 2003 , we may well have cursed the foreign forces that unleashed such horror on our country . \nThe dilemma faced by policy-makers is that stopping one evil does not necessarily protect us from future evils . \nBack in 1999 , at the height of the conflict in Kosovo , Tony Blair delivered a speech in Chicago in which he outlined five questions that he suggested need to be asked whenever international military intervention is being considered . \nAre we sure of our case ? \n-LRB- Blair commented : `` War is an imperfect instrument for righting humanitarian distress , but armed force is sometimes the only means of dealing with dictators . '' -RRB- \nHave we exhausted all diplomatic options ? \nOn the basis of a practical assessment of the situation , are there military operations we can sensibly and prudently undertake ? \nAre we prepared for the long term ? \nDo we have national interests involved ? \nSyria is not Kosovo , nor is it Iraq or Libya . \nBut if the aim of military intervention is to end the killing of civilians and enable the building of a stable , democratic state , well , let 's just say the lessons from Kosovo , Iraq and Libya are far from clear . \nAs Gideon Rachman pointed out in his column , there is always a risk that by stepping in to prevent people dying , you end up being responsible for even more people dying . \nSo suppose you simply wanted to offer a basic level of protection to the people of Homs or other cities in Syria where citizens are at risk . \nHow would you go about it ? \nSend in an international ground force , perhaps made up of Saudi , Qatari and Turkish troops ? \nTo take on the full might of the Syrian army ? \nThere 's been talk of creating humanitarian corridors , safe havens , or buffer zones . \nBut they would all need to be protected by military forces , and one of the lessons from the Balkans conflicts was that even limited interventions can quickly develop into something much more . \nThe assessment of the NATO secretary-general is that even if there were to be a UN mandate for military intervention -LRB- and there 's precious little prospect of that in current circumstances -RRB- , the mission would not have a high likelihood of success . \nIn other words , it would fail on the third of the Blair tests , even if all the others were satisfactorily answered . \nNone of this is meant to suggest that military intervention never works . \nIt ended the killing in Bosnia , although it has failed so far to put in place a stable democracy there ; ditto in Kosovo -LRB- although there is still violence , and countless unresolved issues -RRB- ; ditto in Sierra Leone and East Timor . \nAs far as Homs is concerned , it may be -- with the `` tactical withdrawal '' of the anti-Assad forces from the district of Baba Amr and the arrival of the Red Cross and Red Crescent -- that civilians will now at least be spared the constant fear of death by shelling or sniper fire . \nWhat we do n't yet know is whether the Syria uprising has reached a turning point : does the defeat of the rebels in Homs mean that government forces can now reassert control across the country , or will the rebels simply regroup and prepare for another stand elsewhere ? \nThe northern province of Idlib , close to the Turkish border , may well become the next flashpoint . \nAt 18:03 2nd Mar 2012 , XieMing wrote : The aim of this intervention is to weaken this of the seven governments targeted , including Syria and Iran -LRB- Gen.

conceded at the end of the meeting that it was `` pre-mature '' to plan for an intervention by NATO in Syria but surprisingly concluded that a military intervention would be counter-productive , because of the danger of igniting a civil war in the volatile sociology of Syria . \nHe did not mention the example of the ongoing sectarian civil war in Iraq but this would have been an obvious case study in which both the US and Britain played a big role in creating . \nHaving made major miscalculations of his own in copying the semi-successful Bush surge in Iraq with a corresponding surge of his own initiative in Afghanistan which has obviously reached a stage of failure with the Koran-burning and unauthorized slaughter of Afghan families near the Bagram base by a mentally deranged non-commissioned officer tragedies , President Obama is encouragingly showing a sober realism about US entaglements in the `` Arab Spring '' opportunistic interventionism advocated by his French and

{"id": "286", "time": "2011-06-21", "text": "Syria 's ruling Baath party is facing one of the gravest crises in its history What prompted the protests in Syria ? \nSyrians have endured decades of economic hardship , political repression and corruption under the rule of the Assad family , in power since 1971 . \nPresident Bashar al-Assad - who inherited power from his father Hafez in 2000 - had moved to open up the country 's economy , but continued to jail critics of the regime and maintained a stranglehold on the internet and media . \nThe country 's protests started in Deraa on 18 March Political parties and protests were banned and the emergency law - in place since 1963 - gave the authorities sweeping powers of arrest . \nThe protests kicked off in mid-March , inspired by the revolutions that toppled the leaders of Tunisia and Egypt . \nThey began in the southern town of Deraa , where several teenagers were jailed for spray-painting the popular revolution slogan , `` The people want the fall of the regime '' , on the wall of their school compound . \nResidents protested , calling for the release of the children and chanting `` God , Syria , Freedom '' . \nSecurity forces opened fire on the protesters , killing and wounding several . \nDays of unrest followed , with police shooting more people and protesters burning government buildings . \nThe turmoil in Deraa quickly spread to other towns and cities , including the third-largest city of Homs and Baniyas on the Mediterranean coast . \nProtesters have been calling for greater freedom , an end to corruption , and increasingly - the toppling of President Assad . \nHow has the government responded ? \nWhat is the extent of the crackdown ? \nEarly on in the protests , President Assad , 45 , appeared on television promising to speed up reforms . \nIn a major concession , he lifted the hated emergency law on 21 April . \nBut days later , he resorted to overwhelming force to try to put down the protests . \nOpposition channels have been airing footage of alleged abuses The government has sent tanks and troops into at least nine towns and cities . \nIn Deraa and Homs - where protests have persisted - the government has used tank fire to shoot down unarmed protesters , amateur video footage shows . \nSnipers fire from rooftops on residents who dare to venture outside . \nMen are rounded up and detained in house-to-house night-time raids . \nElectricity and communication lines are cut . \nRoads are blocked and hospitals raided . \nJournalists and UN observers are barred . \nTroops have now moved on the northern town of Jisr al-Shughour , after the government said 120 security personnel were killed there , prompting more than 2,000 people to flee to Turkey . \nHuman Rights groups say about 1,100 civilians have been killed and thousands arrested since pro-democracy protests began on 18 March . \nSeveral hundred members of the security forces are also believed to have died . \nThe government says it is pursuing `` armed gangs '' and `` terrorist groups '' . \nThe government has also announced plans to draft a new election law , but critics have dismissed it as a cosmetic move . \nHow close is Syria to the tipping point ? \nCorrespondents say the protests have not reached the critical mass - as seen in Egypt , Tunisia , or even Yemen . \nThe major cities of Damascus and Aleppo have seen small pockets of unrest , but confined to the suburbs or university campuses , due in part to a heavy security presence . \nAnd the protest epicentres of Deraa , Baniyas and Homs appear to have been silenced - for now - by a heavy military onslaught . \nBut there are conflicting reports about the recent violence in Jisr al-Shughour , with opposition groups saying it was sparked by a desertion from military ranks . \nThe deserters were then shot by loyal troops , they said . \nPresident Assad also has his supporters . \nThere have been massive pro-Assad rallies in the capital , organised by the government in a show of force . \nSome of the smaller protests at university campuses have been met by rival pro-government demonstrators . \nHow is Syria different from Egypt or Libya ? \nThere are several factors that complicate the crisis in Syria . \nMr Assad enjoys strong support within many segments of Syrian society , mostly among minorities , the middle class and the business elite . \nThere are fears of a civil war if President Assad should fall . \nSyria is made up of a precarious mix of confessions - 74 % Sunni ; 10 % Christian , 10 % Alawite , 3 % Druze and 3 % Other Shia . \nEven among those who want to see serious reforms , many would prefer to give President Assad time to implement them . \nUnlike in Egypt , there is no daylight between the army and the regime . \nThe armed forces are overwhelmingly made up of Alawites , so they too are in a fight to maintain their power and privilege . \nWhile there have been reports of low-level defections , the military command appears solid . \nSyria is a major regional power and any chaos here will cause knock-on effects in countries such as Lebanon and Israel , where it can use proxy groups such as Hezbollah and Hamas to cause trouble . \nIt also has close ties with Shia power Iran - an arch foe of the US and Israel - which could potentially draw Western powers into a dangerous Middle Eastern conflict . \nHow has the West responded and should more be done ? \nThe US and EU have strongly condemned the Syrian government 's violence against its own citizens and slapped sanctions on a number of senior Syrian figures . \nOn 18 May , the US imposed sanctions for the first time on President Assad himself , accusing him of human rights abuses . \nAt the start of June , US Secretary of State , Hillary Clinton , called for President Assad to reform or `` get out of the way '' . \nHowever , the Obama administration has no real levers with which to influence the Assad regime . \nWestern officials say they can not act robustly because - unlike with Libya - they do not have the backing of the Arab League , which has remained silent on the issue of Syria . \nThe UN Security Council is also split , with France and the UK proposing a resolution to condemn the crackdown , but nations including Brazil , China and Russia voicing concern that such a resolution could inflame tensions . \nThey also argue that they have no clear picture of Syria after Mr Assad . \nIn the absence of any clear opposition leaders who could unite its rival political , religious and ethnic communities , there are fears the country would descend into chaos . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}

{"id": "38", "time": "2012-08-10", "text": "By Jonathan Marcus BBC Diplomatic Correspondent Syria 's Kurdish activists have begun to take control of towns near the border with Turkey In any assessment of the potential winners and losers from the political chaos in Syria , the country 's Kurdish minority could be among the winners . \nThe Kurds make up a little over 10 % of the population . \nLong marginalised by the Alawite-dominated government , they are largely concentrated in north-eastern Syria , up towards the Turkish border . \nAaron David Miller , a distinguished scholar at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington DC , believes that the Kurds could be one of the main beneficiaries of the demise of the regime of President Bashar al-Assad . \n`` Syria is coming apart , and there 's not much chance it will be reassembled with the kind of centralised authority we saw under the Assads . '' \nFor the Syrian Kurds , whom he describes as `` part of the largest single ethnic grouping in the region that lacks a state '' , there is `` an opportunity to create more autonomy and respect for Kurdish rights '' . \n`` They have the motivation , opportunity , and their Kurdish allies in Iraq and Turkey to encourage them . \nBut what will hold them back is Turkey 's determination to prevent a mini-statelet in Syria along with the Kurds own internal divisions , '' he says . \nThe Kurdish factor in the Syrian crisis will prove to be as significant as the Kurdish question in Iraq '' End Quote Prof Fawaz Gerges London School of Economics `` It is unlikely , '' he believes , `` that Syria 's Kurds will be able to establish a separate entity in Syria . \nNor will the United States , nor the international community accept that . '' \n`` At the same time , the several dimensions of the Kurdish problem - the Iraqi Kurds ' growing determination to remain a separate entity ; Turkish determination to avoid another mini-Kurdistan along the Syrian-Iraqi border ; and the issue of the PKK , the armed Kurdish insurgents fighting the Turkish Army - will create a real flashpoint . '' \nThere in a nutshell is the scale of the problem . \nThe Kurds ' future in Syria will have an important bearing upon what sort of country it is going to become . \nBut the fate of the Syrian Kurds also has ramifications well beyond the country 's borders . \nThese processes are already under way . \nFawaz Gerges , professor of Middle Eastern Politics at the London School of Economics , told me that `` the Syrian Kurds have already seized the moment and are laying the foundation for an autonomous region like their counterparts in Iraq '' . \n`` The exit of Assad 's forces from the Kurdish areas has complicated the crisis and deepened Turkey 's fears that its borders with Iraq and Syria will be volatile for years to come , '' he says . \nTurkey has accused Syria of encouraging rebels from the Kurdistan Worker Party -LRB- PKK -RRB- `` The Kurdish factor in the Syrian crisis will prove to be as significant as the Kurdish question in Iraq . '' \nProf Ofra Bengio , head of the Kurdish Studies program at the Moshe Dayan Centre at Tel Aviv University , agrees . \n`` The Kurdish dimension is likely to become a potent factor in the near future because of the weakening of each of the states in which they live , because co-operation among the states for curbing the Kurds is non-existent , and because the Kurds have made headway in the United States and in the West , where they proved their loyalty and lack of religious extremism . \n`` In a word , the West might like to support them . '' \nIf a Kurdish spectre is stalking the region then it is probably Turkey that has most reason to be worried . \nEven as Ankara has watched developments in Syria with unease , its own struggle with guerrilla fighters of the Kurdish PKK -LRB- designated a terrorist organization by Turkey , the EU and the US -RRB- has flared up again . \nTurkey 's Foreign Minister Ahmet Davotoglu has insisted that the Syrian government is encouraging the PKK , to get its own back for Turkey 's insistence that President Assad must go . \nBut it is even more complicated than this . \nThe dominant Kurdish faction inside Syria is a close ally - some say even an off-shoot - of the PKK . \nIt has little love for the mainstream Syrian opposition championed by the Turks . \nWhilst fighting the PKK on one front , Turkey is desperately trying to curb the political ambitions of Syria 's Kurds by political means . \nIndeed the ramifications of the Kurdish issue go even further . \nProf Gerges insists that the Kurdish question `` is here to stay '' . \n`` It transcends national borders and has the potential to redraw the Sykes-Pico agreement , which , after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in 1918 , established existing nation-state boundaries . \nKurds in Syria have long complained of discrimination by the government `` Although it is too early to talk about the emergence of a greater Kurdistan , an imagined community of Kurds resonates deeply among Kurds across Turkey , Iraq , Syria and Iran . '' \nIt is in this sense the upheavals associated with the `` Arab Spring '' take on their full regional significance . \nThe Sykes-Picot Agreement -LRB- named not surprisingly after the two negotiators , Mr Georges Picot and Sir Mark Sykes -RRB- was a secret understanding made between France and Britain in 1916 for the dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire . \nThe agreement led to the division of Turkish-held areas of the Levant into various French and British administered territories which eventually gave rise to the modern-day states of Syria , Lebanon , Iraq and ultimately Israel . \nMany Syrian Kurds have fled to Iraqi Kurdistan to escape the violence Fawaz Gerges asserts that the events in Syria and their potential repercussions risk over-turning this familiar world ; a broader re-ordering of the region in which Kurdish aspirations are just one part of a very complex picture . \n`` Many of the problems in the contemporary Middle East are traced to that colonial-era Sykes-Picot map , which established the state system in the region . \nThe Palestine and Kurdish questions are cases in point . '' \n`` National borders do not correspond to imagined communities . \nAlthough the state system has established deep roots in the Middle East in the last nine decades , the current uprisings have starkly exposed the fragility of the colonial system imposed on the region . \n`` My take is that the great powers , together with their local partners , will fight tooth and nail to prevent the redrawing of the borders of the state system in the Middle East . \n`` For once the map is re-drawn , where would the limits be ? \nThere would be a real danger of perpetual instability and conflict , '' he says . \nThe Kurds of Syria , of course , are not in quite the same position as their brothers in Iraq and would find it much harder to break away . \nIn the back of the president 's mind , there may be the thought that empowering the Kurds is a way of weakening the Sunni Arab majority '' End Quote Joshua Landis Syrian expert Noted Syria expert Joshua Landis of the University of Oklahoma says that while Syria 's Kurds are a compact minority they are not a majority even in the north eastern border area with Turkey - where they constitute some 30-40 % of the population . \nThey have sometimes tense relations with local Sunni Arab tribes who see this as an integral part of Syrian territory , reinforced by the fact that this is an area rich in oil resources vital to the Syrian economy . \nProf Landis argues that what is going on in the Kurdish north-east offers a useful pointer to President Assad 's `` Plan B '' should his control over key cities like Damascus and Aleppo crumble . \nHe says that the `` embattled president withdrew government forces from the north-east because he could n't control it and wanted to focus on the most important battles in Aleppo and Damascus '' . \n`` But in the back of the president 's mind , there may be the thought that empowering the Kurds is a way of weakening the Sunni Arab majority and underlining the risks of fragmentation should his government fall . \nIt 's a strategy of playing upon divisions to sow chaos , '' he said . \nThis way , says Prof Landis , `` the Syrian Army - which is rapidly becoming an Alawite militia , whilst still the strongest military force - may lose control over large swathes of the country , but will remain a vital factor in determining the political outcome in Syria '' . \nIt is a bleak prospect . \nProf Landis asserts that President Assad `` may lose Syria , but could still remain a player , and his Alawite minority will not be destroyed '' . \n`` That 's the future of Syria , '' he says , with little enthusiasm . \n`` It 's what Lebanon was and what Iraq became . '' \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}

'' \nThe money will be spent on medical supplies such as trauma kits , surgical equipment , medicines and water purification and to assist local doctors with the means to gather forensic evidence for any potential trials in future . \nThe communications equipment includes mobile and satellite phones and radar equipment . \nThe Foreign Office says it will help protect activists overcome the Syrian government 's jamming and blocking techniques . \nThe foreign secretary added that body armor would be provided for civilians who were involved in the protection of others . \nMr Hague , who has also described the Assad regime as `` doomed '' , said it remains British policy not to send arms to Syria . \nBBC security correspondent Frank Gardner says the UK has been quite vocal at the UN but reluctant to get involved on the ground in Syria . \nBut the latest announcement is a realisation that the situation will continue to get worse if it does nothing , he added . \nFormer British foreign secretary , Sir Malcolm Rifkind , says the government should be doing more in Syria . \n`` The way in which you have to act is to actually take the very difficult decision of providing military support to the insurgents , '' he said . \n`` That way you may enhance the conflict in the short term , in the longer term you 're more likely to save thousands of lives . '' \nThe extra practical support for the opposition FSA will include more radio and satellite equipment The UK had previously made # 1.4 m available in `` non-lethal support to the political opposition '' in Syria which included training and assistance to human rights groups . \nThe # 27.5 m in humanitarian aid is for food , medical care , water sanitation and shelter in Syria , as well as for Syrian refugees who have fled to neighbouring countries . \nInternational Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell had announced this week that the amount of assistance being given to the refugees was being quadrupled . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n10th August 2012 - 14:44 Something for those who think that we should be taking sides in Syria should ponder on . \nWhat is happening in Syria today is very like the situation in Germany in the early 1930s when the Nazis and the communists used violence to polarise society . \nNeither side then deserved our support , and neither side now deserves it . \nIt 's the people caught in the middle of it that we must support and protect . \n10th August 2012 - 14:32 How can we send money to fund a war we 're not involved in ?! It 's small change but this has nothing to do with us . \n10th August 2012 - 13:06 As sad as it is to see the people of Syria being killed by their own , i just wish Britain would stay out of it , We get no thanks for the help we give and quite rightly none for the interfering we always seem to do , we cant afford to either . \n10th August 2012 - 11:55 Where does a country with billions in debt get an extra # 5 million to send abroad ? \nWorking for the NHS , this would pay for a substantial number of nurses and doctors to look after those paying the tax to fund this handout . \nInstead we 're continually cutting costs to a bare minimum which will have an affect on patient care . \n10th August 2012 - 10:20 If we are to send anything at all , it should be in the form of what is desperately needed , such as medicines , bandages & medical equipment , food etc. , and definitely not cash . \nWill our governments never learn ? \nWhatever future regime runs Syria will probably be far more radically opposed to the UK than Assad 's dictatorship - with our help . \nAll posts are reactively-moderated and must obey the house rules . \n"}
{"id": "157", "time": "2011-11-30", "text": "Syrians living in Turkey have joined in protests against President Assad Turkey is now one of the harshest critics of President Bashar al-Assad 's government in Syria . \nThis is in striking contrast to the warm personal relations established between Mr Assad and Turkey 's leaders up until this year . \nThe Turkish prime minister has publicly called on Mr Assad to resign , warning that he was turning into a leader `` who feeds on his people 's blood '' . \nTurkish actions , though , have been more cautious . \nIt has been two months since Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan promised to impose sanctions on Syria , but only now have they been announced . \nThey include a travel ban and the freezing of assets of those close to President Assad , severing relations with Syrian banks , and enforcing an arms embargo . \nIn that , they mirror those imposed by the Arab League last week . \nThere are no broader trade sanctions - trade between the two countries rose to $ 2.4 bn -LRB- # 1.5 bn , 1.78 bn euro -RRB- last year - nor any measures that could harm ordinary people , like cutting electricity exports or restricting the flow of water from rivers originating in Turkey . \nNone of this is surprising . \nThe Turkish government has often expressed its scepticism about the effectiveness of sanctions , and Turkish businesses have lobbied hard against any measures that might hurt them . \nTrade with Syria is in any case drying up quickly . \nThe Syrian economy is at a standstill , and Turkish entrepreneurs fear that transporting goods into or through Syria is no longer safe . \nThey are also concerned they may not get paid . \nThere has been a lot of talk about a possible `` buffer zone '' inside Syria , protected by Turkish troops . \nTurkish officials say it has been discussed , but would only be considered if the flow of Syrian refugees became an unmanageable flood , and if Turkey had international backing for such action , in the form of a UN resolution . \nThere has also been talk of `` protected corridors '' running from the Turkish border to troubled areas of Syria , like Idlib and Homs . \nBut again , Turkish officials insist this is a hypothetical scenario , and no-one has explained how such corridors would be protected . \nWhat is clear is how closely Turkey is now co-ordinating its response to the crisis in Syria with other countries . \nThe Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan felt personally betrayed by President Assad When the Arab uprisings started in January , Turkey often appeared to be acting alone , calling for President Mubarak to step down in Egypt before any other leaders ; arguing strongly against any intervention in Libya ; but then , in an about-turn , deciding to join the multinational operation supporting the Libya opposition movement . \nOn Syria , Turkish officials say , they found themselves in the forefront of President Assad 's critics after August , when months of Turkish effort to persuade the Syrian leader to embrace reform collapsed in acrimony . \nMr Erdogan felt personally betrayed by what he saw as broken promises by Mr Assad , and outraged by the continued killing of protesters . \nBut , say those officials , Turkey is more comfortable letting the Arab League , of which Syria is a proud founder member , take the lead in putting pressure on Mr Assad . \nTurkey is consulting Arab League members very closely about tackling Syria , but is being careful not to move ahead of it . \nThere has been surprisingly good co-operation too with France . \nTurkish-French relations had been very poor until this the middle of this year , due to President Nicolas Sarkozy 's very public opposition to Turkey 's EU aspirations , his comments about the slaughter of the Armenian population in 1915 , and his hostility to Turkey 's efforts to mediate in Libya . \nA visit by Mr Sarkozy to Turkey earlier this year - his first as president - was widely judged a diplomatic disaster . \nBut a more recent trip by Foreign Minister Alain Juppe has helped to smooth over their differences , and established common ground in their approach to Syria . \nBoth France and Turkey are leading sponsors of the main Syrian opposition group , the Syrian National Council , and both are working with SNC members to help prepare them for a transition . \nTurkey also gives sanctuary to military defectors who have formed themselves into the Free Syrian Army , although it insists it does not allow FSA attacks to be launched from Turkish territory . \nThe United States too is fully supporting Turkey 's role in Syria . \nIt suits the Obama administration 's back-seat approach to the Arab uprisings , to let a strong ally like Turkey do much of the leg-work in building the regional alliances needed to manage the Syrian crisis . \nIt must also be a source of some satisfaction in Washington to see the strains in Turkey 's relations with Iran over Syria - Turkey 's attempts to engage Iran over its nuclear program last year independently of the US caused some alarm there . \nFor Turkey , the most pressing concern is the impact it will feel from whatever now happens in Syria . \nThey share their longest frontiers with each other , and a civil war in Syria could have unpleasant consequences for Turkey , from waves of refugees , to increased attacks by Kurdish insurgents based over the border . \nTurkish officials say they have given up hope that President Assad can be part of a solution , but they are pressing the various opposition groups to take care not to allow the violence to escalate into a sectarian conflict . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}

'' \nQatar 's Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassim Bin Jabr al-Thani , meanwhile , said the 22-member Arab bloc would give Syria until Wednesday 's Cairo meeting to allow in observers or it would consider turning to the UN Security Council for action . \nThe league suspended Syria 's membership last month , and then imposed sanctions as it tried to persuade Damascus to accept a peace plan that includes the deployment of hundreds of outside observers . \nSome recent Syrian protests have criticised the Arab bloc for canceling a Syria-focused meeting on Saturday and extending a deadline for Damascus to end the crackdown and agree to the observer mission . \nEarlier this month Damascus said it would allow the mission to enter Syria on a number of conditions - including the lifting of sanctions . \nSome 200 members of the Syrian National Council are meeting in the resort of Gammarth north of Tunis in a bid to further unify the Syrian opposition . \n`` We need to emerge from this congress with a higher level of organization , clearer targets and more momentum , '' said SNC leader Burhan Ghalioun . \nThe congress opened on Friday evening and runs until Sunday . \nThe formation of the SNC was formally announced in Istanbul , Turkey , in September , but its leaders are mostly exiled intellectuals who have limited contact with those organising resistance inside Syria . \nEarlier this month , the SNC said it had agreed to co-ordinate action with the Free Syrian Army -LRB- FSA -RRB- , largely made up of renegade soldiers . \nThe council said the FSA had agreed to reduce attacks on government forces . \nAnalysts say the SNC may face a challenge from another opposition grouping , the National Alliance , which was formed in Istanbul on Thursday . \nForeign correspondents are largely banned from the country , making it difficult to confirm accounts of the unrest . \nPresident Assad has denied ordering security forces to attack peaceful protesters , and says the violence is being orchestrated by armed gangs . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}

people seemed to feel that things have changed . \nThat and many other factors will be tested as people come out of mosques all over the country after Friday prayers . \nOpposition leaders are looking for a big turnout as a show of strength . \nBut there are fears about how the security forces may react , especially if there are any acts of provocation . \nThe Local Co-ordination Committees -LRB- LCC -RRB- , an activist network , said shots were fired by security forces at several locations on Friday in a bid to disperse protests . \nA number of civilians were killed on Thursday , after the ceasefire came into effect at 06:00 -LRB- 03:00 GMT -RRB- , activists said , while the government said a bomb attack had killed one soldier . \nThe BBC 's Jim Muir in Beirut says it could be some time before a full picture emerges , but that the impression is the breaches of the ceasefire have not been as serious as some had feared . \nA spokesman for UN and Arab League envoy , Kofi Annan , who drew up the peace plan , said it had been `` relatively respected '' , but that the envoy was `` aware that we do n't have a perfect situation '' in Syria . \n`` There are detainees that need to be released , humanitarian corridors need to be opened , '' said Ahmed Fawzi , although he noted that Syria had granted entry visas to 74 media organizations . \nThe draft UN Security Council resolution calls on the Syrian government and opposition groups to comply with all aspects of Mr Annan 's peace plan , including troop withdrawals and an end to `` all armed violence in all its forms '' . \nActivist Mousab Hamdee on monitoring mission : `` We do n't want people to come and watch us dying '' It threatens unspecified `` further measures '' if the Syrian government `` does not implement its commitments '' . \nThe team of 10 to 12 observers would monitor the ceasefire and check the Syrian military was withdrawing from population centres in accordance with the peace plan . \nMr Fawzi said they were `` standing by to board planes and get themselves on the ground as soon as possible '' and would be followed by a larger mission of some 250 observers . \nSecurity Council diplomats - including those of Russia and China , who have vetoed previous resolutions - have all backed the idea of observers . \nThe ceasefire formally came into effect on Thursday - both sides vowed to observe it , but reserved the right to respond if attacked . \nMr Annan said Syria had not fully complied with the deal as it had yet to withdraw troops and heavy weaponry from towns and cities . \nSyrian-led political process to address the aspirations and concerns of the Syrian people 2 . \nUN-supervised cessation of armed violence in all its forms by all parties to protect civilians 3 . \nAll parties to ensure provision of humanitarian assistance to all areas affected by the fighting , and implement a daily two-hour humanitarian pause 4 . \nAuthorities to intensify the pace and scale of release of arbitrarily detained persons 5 . \nAuthorities to ensure freedom of movement throughout the country for journalists 6 . \nAuthorities to respect freedom of association and the right to demonstrate peacefully US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the ceasefire was important but was just a first step . \nHumanitarian groups must have full access , she said , and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad would `` have to go '' , a step which is not included in the peace plan . \nMrs Clinton said the US supported the deployment of an advance team immediately . \nBut she said the group , as well as any full monitoring mission would `` need complete freedom of movement , unimpeded communications , and access throughout the country and to all Syrians , as well as firm security guarantees from all parties .

{"id": "227", "time": "2012-04-13", "text": "Robin Lustig | 10:20 UK time , Friday , 13 April 2012 Suppose you are an opposition activist in Syria . \nYou live in Hama or Homs , Idlib or Deraa , one of the cities that has been under relentless attack by government forces for months . \nYou have seen friends and relatives killed . \nNeighbours have vanished ; some into jail , others have fled , across the border into Turkey , Jordan or Lebanon , anywhere out of range of Bashar al-Assad 's tanks , artillery , and rooftop snipers . \nYesterday morning , you woke up and it was quiet . \nPerhaps you heard the occasional chatter of an automatic weapon , the thump of an artillery shell or a mortar . \nNevertheless , it was -- relatively -- quiet . \nThe ceasefire seemed to be real . \nThe guns were silent . \nBut then you remembered . \nFor more than a year , you have risked life and limb for a single , simple cause : Assad must go . \nYou were ready to die for that cause , because you hated him , and his regime , so much . \nYet when the guns fell silent yesterday morning , Bashar al-Assad was still president . \nHis tanks and trucks still roamed the streets . \nThe eyes and ears of his secret police , the mukhabarat , were still everywhere . \nThe snipers , probably , were still on the rooftops . \nSo today , tomorrow , the next day , what will you do ? \nHow will you continue your fight without firing a gun ? \nYes , the Annan peace plan says a `` Syrian-led political process '' must follow the ceasefire . \nBut you do n't want a `` process '' ; you want victory . \nYou want to see Assad gone -- exiled like ex-President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of Tunisia ; or jailed like ex-President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt ; or dead , like Colonel Muammar Gaddafi of Libya . \nYes , of course , a ceasefire is a good start -- it means fewer innocent people will die -- but it is only a start . \nI am writing this early on Friday morning . \nWithin a couple of hours , tens of thousands of Syrians will flock to the mosques for Friday prayers . \nAmong them will be thousands of opposition supporters and activists . \nAnd I suspect they will want to show the world that their fight is far from over . \nAfter all , it 's only a couple of weeks since the Gulf states promised to pay the salaries of Syrian rebel fighters . \nIn Riyadh and Doha , they too are committed to seeing the downfall of the Assad dynasty . \nWhat better way to weaken the influence of feared Iran than to defeat its main Arab ally ? \nIn other words , even if as you read these words the ceasefire is still holding , the fight goes on . \nAnd remember , the ceasefire was only one element in the Annan plan . \nHave Syrian government forces withdrawn from population centres -LRB- paragraph 2 -RRB- ? \nHave they ensured the timely provision of humanitarian assistance to all areas affected by the fighting -LRB- paragraph 3 -RRB- ? \nHave they intensified the pace and scale of release of arbitrarily detained persons ; ensured freedom of movement for journalists ; respected freedom of association and the right to demonstrate peacefully -LRB- paragraphs 4 , 5 and 6 -RRB- ? \nIt 's not only journalists and analysts -- paid sceptics -- who doubt whether this ceasefire represents a real fresh start for Syria . \nEven the notoriously cautious UN secretary-general , Ban Ki-moon , who rarely utters a critical remark if he can help it , commented yesterday that `` the world is watching ... with sceptical eyes since many promises previously made by the government of Syria had not been kept . '' \nIt 's possible that , behind the scenes , President Assad 's allies in Moscow and Beijing have read him the riot act . \nIn public , both have urged him to implement the Annan plan in its entirety . \nHe may well have been warned that the patience of Russian and Chinese leaders is not infinite -- as one former pro-Putin MP told me a couple of nights ago : `` Moscow does not want to be seen always to be backing dictators . '' \nSo yes , the Syrian crisis may be entering a new phase -LRB- if , that is , the ceasefire has n't already collapsed by the time you read these words -RRB- . \nBut it ca n't be over , because the root cause of the violence remains : Bashar al-Assad is determined to stay in office , and millions of his fellow countrymen are equally determined to see him go . \nUS has made clear ceasefire implemented Thursday is only a STAGING POST in its plan for regime change in Syria . \nUsing G8 foreign ministers summit , Obama admin demanded govt of Bashir al-Assad comply with all UN proposals to end conflict with WESTERN-BACKED insurgents . \nOn the very first day of the ceasefire , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton insisted that Assad was not complying with all parts of 6-point plan drawn up by former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan . \nShe stated Annan plan is not a menu of options , it is a set of obligations . \ninstallation of UN monitors on the ground within a matter of days to focus their attention on any alleged breaches of the ceasefire by the Govt -LRB- I guess the opposition gets a pass , & any breaches by opposition can easily be blamed on Assad . -RRB- \nHilary Clinton sort of confirmed this interpretation when she stated : burden of fully and visibly meeting all of these obligations continues to rest with the regime . \nIn fact , she added US wants regime change & nothing less will do . \nShe said the US remains firmly resolved that the regime s war against its own people must end for good & political transition must begin . \n-LRB- Sound familiar ? -RRB- \nClinton 's opinions were seconded by Sarkozy and David Cameron . \nCameron added Syria needed a transition at the top to avoid civil war . \nBritish Foreign Secretary William Hague had threatened Wednesday that if a ceasefire is not upheld over the coming days we will want to return to the UN Security Council in attempt to obtain a resolution on Syria . \nWe will intensify our support for the opposition . \nUS had earlier told the press that President Barack Obama had spoken with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and agreed on the need for more resolute action by the UNSC given that Merkel shared concern that the Assad government was not complying with the terms of the agreement negotiated by Kofi Annan & continued to engage in unacceptable brutality against its own people . \nIn fact , the reality is Western powers are FUNDING & DIRECTING insurgency through the mechanism of the Syrian National Council as ell as work on the ground by their regional proxies , most notably Turkey , Saudi Arabia and Qatar . \nKey to creating the basis for a military intervention against Assad is likely to come from false flags = US and NATO working with opposition behind the scenes . \nThe Arab League , Ankara and the Gulf states are the instruments through which this is to be done . \nTurkey is host to the SNC leadership made up of ex-regime elements , Islamists & CIA assets , and its military wing , the Free Syrian Army . \nMany of the attacks on Syrian security personnel and other targets have been directly staged by these opposition forces . \nSaudi Arabia and Qatar are funneling in funds , weapons and fighters to the SNC . \nAttention is now concentrated on setting up a buffer zone on the Turkish border . \nThis will provide a bridgehead and base of operations for the SNC and various other covert operatives . \nMore importantly , its protection will be used to legitimize a wider military deployment and aerial attacks , as was carried out recently in Libya . \nTurkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu was called upon to brief the G-8 on Turkey via video . \nIt is unclear whether or not he will have broached the issue of a buffer zone . \nBut he did not need to . \nThe Turkish media is reporting the Govt is in the process of finalizing plans to seize Syrian territory by force & create a buffer zone . \nTurkey is considering whether to invoke a 1998 agreement with Syria that would sanction an armed intervention ; accord included Syria s pledge not to undermine Turkey s security . \nClinton had spoken earlier by phone about a buffer zone with Davutoglu . \nA State Department official said , Turkey always said there were two triggers for them on further involvement . \nan overwhelming number of refugees and they have told us the number is continuing to escalate , and Turkish Govt said on Tuesday that it expects the UNSC to adopt a decision that would include taking the necessary measures to protect the Syrian people because Assad has failed to live up to his commitments . \nHowever , the UN route towards military action is problematic given the opposition of Russia and China . \nClinton met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Thursday , but there has so far been no sign of Moscow agreeing to UN-sponsored action despite supporting Annan s plan . \nIt still insists publicly that the ONUS RESTS WITH OPPOSITION TO HALT VIOLENCE . \nMore significantly , Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan gave an interview with the daily Hurriyet in which he made an explicit call for NATO backing of any Turkish action against Syria . \nHe said against the violation of borders , a country has rights that belong to norms of the international law . \nMoreover , on the basis of article 5 of the Atlantic Pact , NATO has the responsibility to protect Turkish borders . \nWhat about Syrian borders ? \nMaking clear that the US is the major force being appealed to , he added up until now , this norm has been requested only once : it was requested by the US after the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001 against the World Trade Center and against the Pentagon . \nThe invoking of 9\\/11 by Turkey is shocking , given that it provided the pretext for devastating wars in Afghanistan and Iraq . \nSaudi Defense Minister Prince Salman bin Abdul Aziz also held talks on Syria at the Pentagon on Wednesday . \nHe met with Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and General James Mattis , who as head of US Central Command oversees troops in the Middle East , according to the Saudi Embassy . \nHe then held talks with Obama in the Oval Office , after which a White House spokesman said that the two discussed a range of bilateral and regional issues . \nErdogan is to hold talks with King Abdullah in Riyadh today , with Hurriyet reporting that Erdogan will tell Abdullah that Arab countries must take the lead in coordinated international measures against the Syrian government . \nUS action against Syria is bound up with its ongoing efforts to establish unchallenged global hegemony . \nAlongside Syria , the G8 meeting also discussed Iran the indirect target of the campaign to depose Assad and install a Sunni regime BEHOLDEN to US and allied with Turkey and the Gulf States . \nI consider this Syrian situation so unfair and unjust . \nRemember , there was a referendum in which majority of Syrians supported Assad , and which the west chose to ignore . \nI , like millions in Syria , am not an opposition activist . \nI am interested in living my life and providing for my children . \nI pray that my husband will return safely from his obligatory work trips to Homs , and that my children will return from the daily journeys they make to university near Dara'a . \nI do not want them to end up as so many others - kidnapped by those people who do not live in Syria call `` opposition activists '' and held for ransom and worse . \nI , like billions around the world , want a government without corruption , an honest police force and safe streets . \nI do not believe that violence is the way to achieve these things . \nBy the way , the streets in Syria used to be safe . \nI live in a relatively quiet part of the country and have witnessed no violence , but my relatives in Homs live in daily fear from your `` opposition activists '' . \nI do n't understand how people like you can sit in their comfortable homes or offices and wish full scale war on other people . \nI know nobody in Syria , whether pro- or anti- government who wants war . \nWhy not make an effort to understand the people and the country instead of following the herd , repeating the old cliches ?

'' \nThe Red Cross said it did not know how serious the situation was in Baba Amr . \n`` We really do n't know how many people are still in there . \nIt 's all a bit of a mystery to us , '' said the UK spokesman of the ICRC , Sean Maguire . \nWitnesses and activists say conditions in the district are terrible , with no power and little food , water and medical supplies . \nSyrian state TV has been broadcasting pictures of deserted streets laden with debris . \nPaul Conroy : `` We left behind what I fear is going to be the next Rwanda , the next Srebrenica .

'' \nHe called for security forces to be held accountable for their actions - noting that Mr Assad made no mention of this key demand in his address . \n`` These reform promises are just to deceive Syrians , and intended for world consumption , '' he added . \nSoon after the speech , protesters are reported to have taken to the streets in several cities including Hama , Aleppo and Latakia . \n`` No to dialogue with murderers , '' protesters were heard chanting in the Damascus suburb of Irbin , when reached by telephone by the Reuters news agency . \nAt the same time , rival rallies in support of the Syrian president were also reported at Damascus University and the nearby al-Umawiyeen Square . \nA few hours after the speech , a text message was sent out on mobile networks , calling on government loyalists to rally at Umayyad Square in central Damascus on Tuesday to show their support for President Assad . \nRateb Shallah , head of the Syrian Chambers of Commerce Federation , was at the speech on Monday and expressed confidence in the president 's promised reforms . \n`` I hope it will be a turning point in solving the crisis and that it will meet the demands of the Syrian people , '' he said . \nBut several of the youth protesters who watched the address on TV said they were disappointed . \n`` Next Friday will not be peaceful and the days to come will be difficult , '' said one , speaking in Damascus on condition of anonymity . \nAccording to Louai Hussein , another opposition activist , the speech was addressed to the president 's loyalists , not his opponents . \n`` Nothing new was said , '' says Mr Hussein , who is part of an opposition committee that published a roadmap for political reform a few days ago . \nThe roadmap outlines the steps needed to address the current crisis , but its main aim is to end the violence and killing . \n`` What was mentioned was very important , but it does n't solve the problem with the protesters . \nThere is a need for real freedom so that change can start , '' he added . \nIn his speech , delivered at Damascus University , Mr Assad stressed that the priority is for people to be engaged in the political process , and to contribute to decision making about political reform . \nThe fact that the president addressed youth at the university may be seen as an acknowledgement that parliament does not represent the people and that there is a pressing need for free elections . \nThe majority of protesters and opposition supporters believe that a political solution is the way forward , but for that to happen , there must be an immediate end to the repression and killing , they say . \nDivided Damascus -LRB- 18 Jun 11 | Middle East -RRB- \n"}
{"id": "25", "time": "2012-04-14", "text": "Jim Muir says there is little ceasefire left in Homs and Aleppo . \nThis video has not been independently verified The UN Security Council has passed a resolution authorising the deployment of an advance team of monitors to Syria to oversee the ceasefire there . \nA small group of observers is expected to arrive in Syria on Sunday . \nThe vote comes as a BBC reporter says the ceasefire appears to be in danger of collapsing in some parts of Syria . \nActivists said at least 20 people were killed as hostilities flared in the restive city of Homs and in a shooting at a funeral in Aleppo . \nUN resolution 2042 approves a team of up to 30 unarmed observers to deploy to Syria An initial group of six monitors will arrive in Syria on Sunday The rest of the advance team is set to follow later Once certain conditions are met , the UN will seek approval for an expanded force of about 250 observers Ban Ki-Moon has said he will set out concrete proposals by 18 April for this larger UN observer force The US ambassador to the UN , Susan Rice , condemned the bloodshed saying it raises `` renewed doubts about the sincerity of the -LRB- Syrian -RRB- regime 's commitment to the ceasefire '' . \nShe said the resolution was an important opportunity to stop the bloodshed , adding that the burden was now on the Syrian regime . \nBut Syria 's ambassador to the UN , Bashar Ja'afari , blamed opposition forces for the spike in violence , saying that more than 50 violations had taken place including `` many assassinations and sabotage operations '' . \nSyria 's opposition umbrella group , the Syrian National Council , welcomed the vote . \nBarbara Plett BBC UN correspondent This is the first time the Security Council has been able to adopt a legally binding resolution on the Syria crisis , which in itself is significant - it marks a narrowing of the differences in the international community that analysts say Damascus has exploited . \nBut agreement even on this technical issue was hard won , and shows that divisions on the Council remain over the nature of the conflict . \nWestern nations were able to keep the main emphasis on the regime 's responsibilities to meet its ceasefire commitments , but Russia insisted on also including the opposition 's obligations . \nAnd it was able to soften language on the conditions needed for the observers to operate effectively - the resolution now `` calls upon '' rather than `` requires '' the government to provide full freedom of movement and access . \nAll of which suggests each step of Kofi Annan 's peace plan will be contested , not only on the ground but also in the Security Council . \nThe resolution was passed unanimously after Russia approved a revised text , which authorised the deployment of a team of about 30 unarmed observers . \nDiplomats had revised a US-proposed draft on Friday to accommodate Russian objections . \nRussia 's ambassador said Moscow supported the resolution because of the need for a rapid deployment of observers . \nIndeed the UN has said that it intends to increase the deployment to 250 - but that is dependent on certain conditions and will require further approval . \nMeanwhile the BBC 's Jim Muir in Beirut , who has been monitoring developments in Syria , says that in parts of the country the ceasefire seems to be in danger of collapsing , unless something is done to shore it up . \nSaturday witnessed a surge in violence , with activists saying at least 20 people killed in several incidents around the country : In Homs activists said security forces pounded some quarters with tanks and rocket fire Violence was particularly acute in the Qarabis quarter of the city , where video from activists appeared to show immense destruction Several quarters of the city seemed to have a considerable presence of rebel fighters from the Free Syrian Army In Aleppo , in the north of the country , heavy casualties were reported from a shooting at the funeral of a protester Activists said security forces opened fire on mourners , but state television blamed armed rebels opening fire at random In Geneva , UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon welcomed the resolution and also announced that UN aid co-ordinator Valerie Amos would chair a humanitarian forum on Syria in Geneva on 20 April . \nBritish ambassador Mark Lyall Grant : '' Today 's resolution is absolutely clear about the commitments that the Syrian regime must now fulfil '' He said that about a million people had been displaced inside Syria over the past 13 months of fighting and added that many more had been forced to flee to neighbouring countries . \nMr Annan , the envoy for the UN and Arab League , drew up the plan which called for an advance monitoring team to be deployed immediately to Syria to observe compliance with the truce . \nMr Annan 's plan aims to end more than a year of violence in Syria which the UN says has killed more than 9,000 people , mostly civilians . \nThe resolution passed on Saturday expresses an intention to establish a full mission once there is a sustained cessation of violence . \nIt also puts the onus on the Syrian government to meet its ceasefire commitments . \nSyrian-led political process to address the aspirations and concerns of the Syrian people 2 . \nUN-supervised cessation of armed violence in all its forms by all parties to protect civilians 3 . \nAll parties to ensure provision of humanitarian assistance to all areas affected by the fighting , and implement a daily two-hour humanitarian pause 4 . \nAuthorities to intensify the pace and scale of release of arbitrarily detained persons 5 . \nAuthorities to ensure freedom of movement throughout the country for journalists 6 . \nAuthorities to respect freedom of association and the right to demonstrate peacefully The text `` calls upon all parties in Syria , including the opposition , immediately to cease all armed violence in all its forms . '' \nThe BBC 's Barbara Plett at the United Nations in New York says that it provides important backing to Mr Annan 's peace plan . \nSignificantly , it is the first time Security Council members have been able to overcome divisions and adopt a resolution on Syria , which is a diplomatic defeat for Damascus , she says . \nAnalysts say Russia appears to have been key to persuading President Bashar al-Assad to accept both the Annan plan and the ceasefire . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n14th April 2012 - 19:53 Russia and China and Iran have supported Assad and some sent weapons . \nThey should be ashamed of themselves . \nThey are responsible for so much suffering and killing and destruction . \nDoes Russia and China and Iran think that killing 9000 people and destroying everything is better than the regime change in Libya ? \nProper governments in 2012 do not kill their own people for protesting . \n14th April 2012 - 19:18 The power of any government surely rests with the rights of its citizens . \nWhen these citizens are subjected to violence on this scale , simply for protesting their ruling government 's policies , something must be done to protect their rights . \nThere can be no excuses for what has happened in Syria . \nThe UN must take a much firmer stance . \nWhilst caution is a virtue , it is now morally redundant . \n14th April 2012 - 18:48 Sadly , I think the odds of the ceasefire holding are little to none . \nAssad knows that his only method for retaining control in the rebelling areas is fear , and the rebels are probably a little too hopeful of Western intervention if it does n't work . \nIt boils down to blood , power and revenge , and no rules have ever kept those in check . \n14th April 2012 - 18:44 the UN should send a large armed peacekeeping force in NOW . \nall of Assad 's forces should be disarmed then all the rebel forces should be disarmed then pave the way for elections -LRB- use force if thay need to -RRB- but as soon as all the heavy weapons are held by the UN then most of the govment forces would be powerless to stop the people doing what thay want 14th April 2012 - 17:59 The deployment of monitors is an imperative step . \nThe Syrian government needs to be watched like an hawk . \nIn the same breath , rebels should follow the conditions laid down by Kofi Annan . \nThere are bound to be violations from both sides . \nThe killing of civilians should stop . \nImpartial observers should report back to the Security Council . \nConcrete action should follow . \nAll posts are reactively-moderated and must obey the house rules . \n"}

{"id": "253", "time": "2012-03-10", "text": "Kofi Annan wants a ceasefire and greater access for humanitarian aid As the special UN-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan embarked on what looked like a Mission Impossible that was unlikely to produce swift results , the way ahead in Syria was shrouded in the smoke of war . \nBut amidst the many confusions and complexities , there were a few elements that could be taken as givens unless something changes dramatically . \nPresident Bashar al-Assad and his associates will continue the campaign they launched in late January to crush all armed resistance and secure the country 's borders against the infiltration of fighters , guns and money . \nAccepting a ceasefire that fell short of that , would not only put on a level footing what the regime regards as armed terrorists implementing a foreign plot , but would also risk seeing large tracts of the country slipping permanently out of its control . \nFor the same reasons , any access for humanitarian aid will have to happen in co-ordination with the Syrian authorities . \nDamascus would see the establishment of cross-border aid corridors giving independent and unrestricted access to trouble spots as an unacceptable infringement of its sovereignty . \nIn these key positions , the regime seems to enjoy solid and crucial support from both Russia and China . \nSo there will be no immediate ceasefire , nor will blanket permission be given for aid deliveries outside regime control . \nAll that is quite apart from the positions adopted by most of the Syrian opposition , which also make an early peaceful solution look unlikely . \nMost groups refuse to consider talking to the regime - or at least President Assad - because so much blood has been spilled in ruthless repression that continues on the ground . \nMost activists simply want the downfall of the regime , not some compromise that would allow it to survive in a perhaps only slightly mutated form . \nThey would see negotiations now as being from a position of weakness , especially given the regime 's aggressive reassertion of military control since late January . \nMr Annan also finds himself in the anomalous position of representing an Arab League which has thrown its weight behind regime change too . \nThe League 's 22 January resolution , which triggered the regime 's crackdown , drops all mention of dialogue with Damascus , prescribes a menu for political change starting with President Assad handing power immediately to his deputy , and gives political cover for Arab states to provide military and other support to the opposition . \nMost opposition activists simply want the downfall of the regime , not a compromise That formula worked in Yemen . \nBut Syria is not Yemen . \nThe Arab League position is also supported by most of the Western powers and their allies . \nThat is sharply at odds with the balanced positions adopted by Kofi Annan himself , who insists that any political solution must involve dialogue with all the `` actors '' on the ground , necessarily including the regime . \nHe is against arming the opposition or any form of outside military intervention , arguing that they will complicate an already drastic situation . \nOn paper at least , that actually puts him closer to the Russian and Chinese positions than to those of the Western powers . \nHe will have to draw on all his considerable skills and experience if he is to find common ground between these polarised stands . \nClearly , that is going to take time , if it is indeed attainable . \nIf Mr Annan is to stand a chance of producing a peaceful political solution , he would have to persuade the Saudis , Qataris and other key players in the Arab League , and indeed the West , that pushing for regime change is going to plunge Syria and the region into deeper chaos . \nThe West , also set on regime change , finds itself casting around with few valid options for bringing that about swiftly and surely . \nNato and its member powers have from the outset ruled out external military intervention as in Libya , and they continue to do so for a wide variety of compelling reasons - despite the hopes of many Syrian opposition groups that they can somehow be drawn in . \nQatar 's Prime Minister has been pushing for Arab military intervention in Syria The West is also wary of pouring arms into the opposition , for fear of fuelling a sectarian civil war in which Sunni Islamist radicals could come to the fore - especially since al-Qaeda has begun urging jihadis to join the fray , raising anxieties on which the regime has skilfully played . \nThe Western powers ' strategy of economic and political sanctions has helped isolate and pressure the regime . \nIt is certainly feeling the pinch , as the value of the Syrian pound plummets , cash flows dry up , and industry and tourism grind to a halt . \nBut as Iraq showed , such pressures can continue for years without necessarily bringing about the desired result . \nThe Syrian opposition , still badly fragmented both politically and militarily , also finds itself in a bind . \nAfter months of ruthless repression , and the years that preceded it , taking up arms is a natural development , and one which has inflicted a cost on the regime . \nBut it is also playing the regime at its own game and engaging in a confrontation which the rebels could only hope to win decisively with the kind of outside intervention that tilted the balance so abruptly against Col Muammar Gaddafi in Libya . \nImagine what the situation might be there now , had Nato not intervened , and that might give some idea of what may lie ahead in Syria . \nIf Kofi Annan can not induce major shifts in position on the part of many of the key players in this bloody and convoluted drama , the most likely scenario will be this : The regime will complete its crushing of armed resistance wherever it finds it , with much of the immediate focus shifting north-westwards to Idlib province and the borderlands with Turkey . \nBut it will continue to face a low-level insurgency as well as civil protest in many -LRB- mainly Sunni -RRB- areas , where it has clearly lost the hearts and minds of the people . \nSome neighbors , especially Turkey , may become increasingly permissive in terms of allowing the cross-border fuelling of insurgents . \nAnd some Arab states , notably the Saudis and Qataris , may become more assertive and open in arming and financing the rebels , while the Western powers continue their efforts to unify the opposition and provide its military wing with non-lethal assistance . \nThis route could still lead to a collapse of the regime as its fabric slowly unravels , with accelerated military defections , the gradual spread of dissent and the worsening of economic and social conditions . \nBut , while there could be surprises , it risks being a long and brutal process which might tear the country apart at the seams - along fault-lines which run through the wider region . \nIt has in it the already apparent seeds both of a Syrian sectarian civil war and of the kind of regional and international proxy conflict which consumed neighbouring Lebanon for decades and which is still latent there . \nThe regime may ultimately be doomed , but the fact is that it retains some bedrock support not only among the party faithful but also among sections of society fearful of a plunge into the unknown . \nIt maintains an iron grip which has so far prevented military units defecting en masse , and it has shown every sign of determination to fight to the bitter end even if that means bringing the house down around it . \nGiven everything that has happened , few of the regime 's domestic or external adversaries believe that the inner circle of power is genuinely prepared to envisage a graceful transition to real democracy , either through negotiations or through the regime 's own reform process that should see multi-party general elections in May . \nThat , and all the blood , is why most of the opposition reject dialogue and regard mediation with the regime as simply buying it more time . \nKofi Annan has already won one Nobel Peace Prize . \nIf he can conjure a peaceful solution out of the elements he is working with now , he will surely deserve another . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}

despite misgivings from within the Assad family because he was a divorced father-of-five who was 10 years her senior . \nThey eloped after the death of Basil Assad , who had objected to the match . \nAfter receiving the blessing of Hafez , he was welcomed into the family and built a close relationship with Bashar . \nBushra reportedly nurtured the relationship through her influential role as the president 's secretary . \nFormer Vice-President Abdul Halim Khaddam said Gen Shawkat was a `` smart , cultivated , and courageous officer with great ambitions '' , who had established ties with intelligence chiefs and other powerbrokers . \nBut there were reports of friction with Bashar 's younger brother , Maher , who is alleged to have shot him in the stomach in 1999 . \nHe was allegedly flown to Paris for treatment at a military hospital . \nGen Shawkat later became the de facto chief of military intelligence , a title he officially acquired in 2005 . \nAfter the 11 September 2001 attacks , Gen Shawkat was one of the president 's main liaisons to intelligence agencies in the US and Europe and helped set up a US intelligence operation in Syria , which was later shut down after relations between the two countries soured . \nIn 2005 , Maher and Shawkat were both mentioned in a preliminary report by UN investigators as one of the people who might have planned the assassination of the former Lebanese Prime Minister , Rafik Hariri . \nThe next year , Gen Shawkat was named a Specially Designated National -LRB- SDN -RRB- by the US , allowing his assets to be frozen . \nIt said he had `` been a key architect of Syria 's domination of Lebanon , as well as a fundamental contributor to Syria 's long-standing policy to foment terrorism '' . \nThe US and EU imposed sanctions on Gen Shawkat in 2011 , accusing him of playing a key role in suppressing demonstrations . \nIn January 2012 , he was reported to have been involved in negotiations which led to an unprecedented truce between security forces and the rebel Free Syrian Army -LRB- FSA -RRB- in Zabadani , a mountain town north-west of Damascus . \nThe truce lasted just under a month , after which the military recaptured it . \nIn mid-May 2012 , opposition activists claimed that Gen Shawkat had died and been buried in his hometown of Madhala after being poisoned by rebels . \nInterior Minister Mohammed al-Shaar , Defense Minister Daoud Rajiha , National Security Bureau -LRB- NSB -RRB- chief Hisham Ikhtiar and Hassan Turkomani , assistant to the vice-president , were also allegedly killed . \nGen Turkomani subsequently appeared on TV to dismiss the report , while Mr Shaar denied them in a telephone interview , but Gen Shawkat did not do so , fuelling the rumors about his death . \nOn 18 July , state media reported that Gen Shawkat had been killed in a suicide bomb attack at the headquarters of the National Security Bureau . \nGen Daoud Rajiha was appointed defense minister in August 2011 , and remained in the post after a cabinet reshuffle in June . \nThe US and EU imposed sanctions on Gen Rajiha in May , accusing him of responsibility for repression The 65 year old had previously served as chief of staff of the armed forces for seven years . \nHe was promoted to the rank of general in 2005 . \nHe specialised in artillery at the Syrian military academy , from which he graduated in 1967 . \nIt is believed Gen Rajiha was a Greek Orthodox Christian , a rarity in the Syrian military and government , which is dominated by the Alawite sect of President Bashar al-Assad . \nIn March 2012 , the US Treasury imposed sanctions on Gen Rajiha for his role in the repression of dissent in Syria . \nThe EU also added him to its list of designated officials , saying he was responsible for the military 's involvement in the crackdown on protesters . \nHassan Turkomani , assistant to the vice-president Gen Hassan Turkomani was appointed assistant to the vice-president - with the rank of minister - in 2009 . \nHe was also said to been made a special envoy of President Assad . \nGen Hassan Turkomani : Long-standing senior member of ruling Baath Party Born in 1935 , Mr Turkomani joined the army in the 1950s . \nHe fought against Israel and in Lebanon , before being made a general in the 1980s and military chief of staff in 2002 . \nHis appointment as defense minister in 2004 - replacing Mustafa Tlas , who had been in that position for 32 years - went against speculation that the next postholder would be a civilian . \nA Sunni Muslim unlike many in the Syrian elite , Gen Turkomani was also a long-standing senior member of the ruling Baath Party , serving on its Regional Command and Central Committee . \nActivists say that after protests erupted against President Assad in 2011 , Gen Turkomani was appointed head of the security forces ' crisis management office , which is based at the National Security Bureau 's headquarters in Damascus . \nIn August , the EU imposed sanctions on the general as it targeted senior government officials . \nHisham Ikhtiar , director of the National Security Bureau -LRB- NSB -RRB- Born in 1941 , Gen Ikhtiar was the head of the Baath Party Regional Command 's National Security Bureau -LRB- NSB -RRB- , which co-ordinates the work of Syria 's intelligence agencies and formulates recommendations for the president . \nBetween 2001 and 2005 , he was in charge of the General Security Directorate -LRB- GSD -RRB- . \nGen Hisham Ikhtiar was a leading Baath Party figure and head of the National Security Bureau In 2006 , the US imposed financial sanctions on Gen Ikhtiar for `` significantly contributing to the Syrian government 's support for designated terrorist organizations '' , including Hezbollah . \nWhile at the GSD , Gen Ikhtiar directed activities that `` significantly contributed to the Syrian government 's military and security presence in Lebanon '' , it said . \nIn 2007 , he was included on a list of Syrians forbidden to enter US soil . \nGen Ikhtiar was reportedly charged with quelling the initial pro-democracy protests in Deraa . \nThe brutal crackdown launched by the security services in the southern city helped trigger the recent nationwide unrest . \nIn May 2011 , the US treasury department imposed sanctions on the National Security Bureau , saying it had directed Syrian security forces to use extreme force against demonstrators . \nThe EU and US later imposed individual sanctions on Gen Ikhtiar , with the latter saying he had directed security forces to `` use extreme force against demonstrators '' . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}
{"id": "56", "time": "2012-07-27", "text": "Robin Lustig | 12:14 UK time , Friday , 27 July 2012 The Battle of Aleppo seems to be shaping up into one of those key moments that could determine the outcome of what we can probably now call the Syrian civil war . \nIt is Syria 's second largest city and its commercial hub , classified by UNESCO as a world heritage site because of its priceless cultural and architectural treasures . \nUntil relatively recently , it had been able to stand aside from the turmoil that was tearing the rest of the country apart . \nA week after battles raged in parts of the capital , Damascus , now it 's Aleppo 's turn , as the rebels ratchet up the pressure in the apparent belief that their moment has come . \nSo where does that leave Syria 's neighbors , and where does it leave the rest of the world ? \nI was struck by a line in an impressively dispassionate report published by the defense policy think-tank the Royal United Services Institute : '' ... the question of some sort of Western intervention in Syria has shifted from a predilection to stay out of the conflict in any physical sense to an awareness that intervention is looking increasingly likely . \nWe are not moving towards intervention but intervention is certainly moving towards us . '' \nThe argument goes like this : increasingly foreign governments are worrying about what 's likely to happen when -LRB- not if -RRB- Bashar al-Assad is forced out . \nIn the words of RUSI 's director , Professor Michael Clarke : '' ... the regional implications of this dynamic of violence are more a driver of international diplomacy than the human misery inside Syria itself . '' \nSyria 's neighbor Lebanon is a tinderbox where just one spark can ignite a conflagration ; and Iraq and Iran , with their Shia majorities , are lined up against Turkey and Saudi Arabia , with their Sunni majorities . \nProfessor Clarke talks of an `` arc of proxy confrontation '' between Iran and Saudi Arabia , which could lead to all kinds of trouble . \nPerhaps the question should be not `` Will outside powers intervene in Syria ? '' \n, but `` Will they intervene more than they are already ? '' \nAs the RUSI report points out : '' Already , it is believed that western intelligence and special force operations are actively underway ... Western countries have backed the growing supply of arms , via Arab sources , to rebel forces for some months now ... Saudi Arabia and Qatar , with US and Turkish facilitation , have been arming and funding the opposition ; and this covert support has been substantially responsible for the progress opposition forces have made in recent weeks . '' \nOn the government side , the report says : `` Several Russian ships carrying a range of military equipment for the Assad regime are already at sea ... '' And the Iranians are unlikely to stand idly by if they see their strategic interests put at risk : in order to preserve their influence with Shia groups in Lebanon , for example : `` the Iranians would provide weapons , materiel and probably elements of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps to support Assad , as they did successfully with the Shia militias in Iraq . '' \nNo one is suggesting that the West is likely to mount an Iraq-style international ground invasion , nor even a Libya-style air campaign . \nBut RUSI 's Jonathan Eyal has this stark warning : `` Western governments which have long worked for Assad 's departure should now begin to fear what may lie in store . \nFor , instead of imploding as other Arab countries did when they were gripped by revolutions , Syria will explode , disgorging its troubles across the entire Middle East , with potentially catastrophic consequences which will need to be managed , since they look unlikely to be avoided . '' \nAnd he makes this additional point : `` President Assad was -LRB- note the past tense -RRB- the region 's last secular strongman , the last of the Arab leaders who repressed religious and ethnic differences in the name of a higher pan-Arab ideology . \nHis method of government is now as defunct as that of the Soviet Union or communist Eastern Europe , on which it was based . '' \nUntil recently , the conventional wisdom was that international intervention in Syria simply was n't on the cards . \nIf the RUSI report is right , it may be time to rethink some of those assumptions : just watch the price of oil if tensions rise and Western governments start to panic at the thought of further price pressures as they struggle to save their faltering economies . \nAt 12:20 30th Jul 2012 , BluesBerry wrote : Frankly , I do n't know hat is going to happen in Syria and surrounding area , but a read a confirmation yesterday that US-NATO supported `` Free Syrian Army '' was defeated in Damascus . \nGovt is in full control of the nation 's capital and has declared this victory . \nIn Aleppo , Govt forces have regained control of most of the city with pockets of rebel fighters still active in the S.W.

beginning in Tunisia with the Jasmine revolution followed by the Benghazi uprising in Libya and of course the anti-Mubarak youth uprising in Egypt in January of 2011 . \nThe Libyan overthrow of Khaddafy was facilitated only with the military assistance of NATO 's NFZ intervention which then morphed into a full scale air support of the Benghazi rebels exceeding the mandate of UN resolution 1973 . \nIn Egypt , the youth rebellion in January 2011 , believed to be a purely indigenous movement , succeeded in a remarkable three week period in peacefully overthrowing Mubarak . \nBy staying out of active defense of Mubarak , the military -LRB- SCAF -RRB- may have provided the means by which the rebellion succeeded . \nOne of the best discussions of these explosive movements of the Arab spring that I have seen is the Youtube discussion -LRB- Webster Tarpley in Press TV debate with Libyan Rebel Supporters -RRB- held by pressTV . \nir , held on April 6 , 2011 with a youth panel in Beirut and experts in Philadelphia , London , and Washington . \nJournalist Webster Griffin Tarpley advanced the theory that much of the Arab spring movements were planned and executed behind the scenes from Washington except possibly for the purely indigenous uprising in Tunisia . \nThis theory opposed by the other experts , claims that the Egyptian uprising was orchestrated by a group called Otpor responsible for the Serbian overthrow of Slobodan Milosevich and for the many `` colored '' revolutions in Eastern Europe that followed . \nThe fact that social media -LRB- Facebook -RRB- played such an important role in organizing the interaction between Egyptian youth groups such as Kefaya and April 5th tends to reinforce Tarpley 's conspiracy theories . \nNow in the current Syrian insurgency which is much more complex than the previous uprisings we need to step back also and try todisentangle some of the threads of the current upsurge in fighting between the Assad government and the rebels . \nThere is evidence that the boldly successful assasination of Assad 's inner circle of security and military leaders was plotted and carried out by Saudi intelligence services under the direction of their newly appointed head Prince Bandar bin Sultan . \nIt is unlikely that the intricate operation could have been planned or carried out by the Syrian rebels who lack the sophisticated ability to penetrate the Syrian high command structure . \nThe little reported assasination of the deputy Saudi intelligence chief in Riyadh and the still possibility of the mortal wounding of Prince Bandar himself was carried out in retaliation by the Syrians has been unconfirmed thus far . \nOf course , despite the widely believed reports in Western media that the Assad government was in full retreat and facing disintegration in Damascus as a result of the wiping out of the security high command has since proven to be wildly premature as the Syrians were able to wipe out much of the resistance in Damascus in recent weeks . \nThe uprising in Aleppo itself though still strong also shows signs of weakening as the Syrian military pounds their strongholds with artillery and helicopter gunships . \nThe inability of the expat anti-Assad movement to coalesce around a common agenda for proceeding with the overthrow of Assad frustrates the outside powers who have organized numerous get togethers -LRB- Tunis , Istanbul , Paris -RRB- . \nThe presidential re-election campaign in full swing in the US which has an inhibiting effect on western intervention at this crucial time frustrates hawks such as former head of the State Department Policy Planning Office , AnneMarie Slaughter , who wrote a scathing , `` we will pay a high price if we do not arm Syria 's rebels '' , in August 1st edition of the Financial Times . \nThe USA has been plotting to overthrow Syria since 2001 . \nThe campaign reached a frenzied tempo about 16 months ago . \nThe UK government , as obedient poodle , has copied the US , even to the wording of policies and announcements . \nIt has been bitterly disappointing that BBC management has , for due consideration received , filtered and biased the news to present a false story of events in Syria . \nEven the BBC Trust has been given funds by the US State Department . \nThe British public deserves a chance to know the

faces problems with consolidating his tenuous grip on Egyptian internal affairs with his uncertain relations with the military who resent any attempts to loosen their still strong grip over civil and economic control . \nRelations between the newly dominant position of the MB over Egyptian politics and the minority communities especially the Coptic Christians is also a potential threat to peace within Egypt . \nIt for this reason that I would advise President Obama not to get more deeply embroiled in the domestic affairs of Syria through deeper military involvement in their civil war . \nHe

{"id": "15", "time": "2012-07-27", "text": "By Wyre Davies BBC News Some Syrian Kurds have fled to Iraq , but the many remaining are asserting autonomy as the Assad regime becomes embroiled in conflict Like Iraq , Jordan and Lebanon Turkey has already absorbed - almost without hesitation - thousands of Syrians fleeing the fighting , in particular from the northern cities of Hama and Aleppo . \nTurkey is understandably concerned that the number of civilians fleeing across its relatively open southern border will increase as the fighting intensifies in Syria . \nSome of those refugees also bring their own political baggage with them and there have already been disturbances in the border camps . \nOccasionally ethnic and regional tensions spill over as thousands of displaced Syrians live cheek by jowl in tents under the blisteringly hot summer sum . \nBut for Turkey , the refugee issue is a mere inconvenience compared to what it thinks will be the biggest fall-out of the Syrian crisis - the Kurds and Kurdistan . \nIn an almost mirror image of what happened in Iraq after 1991 , Kurdish nationalists in northern Syria are making the most of the turmoil and violence in the rest of the country to strengthen their own identity and position . \nFor Turkey , it is like a red rag to a bull . \nAs the Assad regime pulls in regular Syrian troops from peripheral areas for the military assault on Aleppo , there is clear evidence that others are almost seamlessly moving in to the vacuum left behind . \nAnd in some Kurdish parts of northern Syria the opposition forces of the Democratic Union Party -LRB- PYD -RRB- and other smaller factions have all but taken over . \nThe leader of the PYD , Salih Muslim , spoke to the BBC in recent days about his movement 's strategy and aspirations . \n`` We are able to govern ourselves - we have the power for it , '' he said . \nMr Muslim was careful to insist , at this stage at least , that he was n't calling for an independent Kurdistan but an autonomous region within a new , democratic Syria . \nIt is thought that Kurdish militias now control at least four main towns and cities in northern Syria . \nThey reportedly include at least parts of Qamishlo , Efrin , Amude , Terbaspi and Ay El Arab . \nMore remarkable is that although there were sporadic clashes and some loss of life many of them appear to have been secured without much of a fight . \n`` We warned them to leave the Kurdish areas , otherwise we would resort to different measures , '' says Muslim , referring to civil administrators and officials from Damascus who used to run the towns . '' \nThey were aware of the people 's demands and that 's why they gave in without blood being spilled . '' \nTurkish Prime Minister Erdogan sees a Kurdish enclave in Syria a direct threat to Turkey Quite deliberately choosing to describe the region of northern Syria as `` West Kurdistan '' the PYD leader said most people in the region stood with the movement and supported their aims . \nThose aims are certainly not supported by the Turkish government , which has , for decades , fought its own often bloody battles with Kurdish separatists and nationalists of the PKK - the Kurdish Workers ' Party . \nIn a blunt message at the end of this week , Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan made it abundantly clear he saw the creation of a separate Kurdish enclave in northern Syria as a direct threat to his own country 's interests and security . \nMr Erdogan said that Ankara would not accept the creation of a `` terrorist '' structure in the region . \n`` It is our most natural right to intervene -LRB- in northern Syria -RRB- since those terrorist formations would disturb our national peace , '' said the Prime Minister in a television interview . \nTurkey , a one time ally of the Assad regime in Syria for pragmatic and economic reasons as much as anything , has all but given up on Damascus . \nOn more than one occasion Mr Erdogan has called on President Bashar al-Assad to stop the onslaught against his own people and to step down before more lives are lost . \nSome in Turkey also believe that a desperate President Assad has deliberately abandoned , or handed over , the northern regions to the PYD in order to create tensions with Turkey and also divide the already fractious opposition movements in Syria . \nThe crisis has emboldened Syria 's Kurds but some analysts say their relationship with the FSA is tense `` In the North , -LRB- Assad -RRB- has already allocated five provinces to the terrorists -LRB- Kurds -RRB- , '' Mr Erdogan was quoted as saying by a Turkish news agency last week . \nAnkara simply regards the Syrian PYD as a branch of its own , outlawed PKK . \nBut the criticism and allegations of trying to create regional instability are n't limited to the pariah that is the regime in Damascus . \nThe autonomous Kurdish administration in northern Iraq has now admitted it has been training Kurdish-Syrian fighters on its territory . \nIn a recent interview the regional leader , President Massoud Barzani , openly confirmed the presence of a military training camp where `` a good number of young Kurds '' have been trained . \nWith as many as 20million Kurds in Turkey alone , watching their brethren to the east quite literally marking out their territory , the famously nationalist Turks are , to put it mildly , concerned . \nTurkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davatoglu is being dispatched to northern Iraq in the coming days where , according to reports , he will talk with Kurdish officials there about the situation in Syria and Turkish `` sensitivities . '' \nMany things are still unclear ; relations between the Syrian Kurds and other opposition groups -LRB- the Free Syria Army -RRB- are said to be tense . \nIn some Syrian Kurdish towns under the de-facto control of the PYD , pro Assad troops have remained in their barracks , raising questions about a deal , of sorts , between Damascus and the Kurds . \nAnd , the biggest question of all , will Turkey carry out its threat to intervene militarily in northern Syria to prevent the creation of a Kurdish `` entity '' . \nOne thing is certain . \nIf and when President Assad is driven from power , the country he leaves behind will for some time be divided , damaged and violent . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}

also mostly army defectors - were hunted down by the army and killed the next day in an `` organised massacre '' . \nSyrian forces began shelling the restive city of Homs on 3 February , in what was to become a month-long bombardment . \nEarly reports talked of as many as 200 deaths , but one of the main activist groups later revised its confirmed number down to 55 . \nThe BBC 's Paul Wood , who was in Homs traveling with fighters from the Free Syrian Army , described a city under siege . \nThe bodies of 45 people , mostly women and children , were found in the Karm el-Zeytoun neighborhood of Homs on 12 March . \nNew York , 21 March 2012 The UN Security Council backed UN-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan 's peace plan to end all violence , provide humanitarian relief and secure a peaceful transition of power . \nThe Syrian government accepted the plan six days later . \nThe first UN observers , a group of just six , began their work to monitor the situation on the ground as part of the Annan peace plan . \nTheir numbers increased to nearly 300 over the following weeks , but with violence continuing to escalate they suspended their operations on 16 June . \nThe largest of a series of attacks blamed on suicide bombers in the capital , in which 55 people died after explosions outside the military intelligence building . \nMany of the attacks have targeted security facilities . \nThe government blames anti-regime forces and Islamist groups linked to al-Qaeda , but the opposition says the attacks are staged in an attempt to discredit them . \nThe village of Taldou , in the Houla region near Homs , witnessed one of the worst massacres in Syria 's uprising . \nUN observers confirmed that 108 people were killed , most of them women and children . \nSome had been killed by shell fire , but the majority had been shot at point-blank range or stabbed . \nThe government blamed terrorists , but survivors and human rights groups pointed the finger at the army and shabiha militiamen allied to the government . \nManaf Tlas , a general from a Sunni family close to the Assads , fled Syria , in the highest-level desertion of the regime so far . \nTwo weeks later , he was confirmed to be in France . \nOpposition activists and witnesses said army tanks bombarded the village for several hours before pro-government militiamen swept in , shooting and stabbing victims at close range . \nThey reported that as many as 220 people were killed , including a number of rebel fighters . \nThe Syrian government said at least 50 people were killed in Tremseh , but it blamed `` armed terrorist groups '' . \nDefense Minister Daoud Rajiha and his deputy Assef Shawkat , President Assad 's brother-in-law , are killed in a suicide attack during a high-level meeting at the national security headquarters , Syrian state TV says . \nGeneral Hassan Turkomani , an assistant to the vice-president , is also killed in the attack . \nThe interior minister and national security chief were said to be injured in the attack , which some analysts describe as a turning point in the fate of the Assad regime . \nThe rebel Free Syrian Army -LRB- FSA -RRB- and a jihadist group calling itself Lord of the Martyrs Brigade both said they were behind the bombing . \nReports say the bomber was working as a bodyguard for members of the inner circle . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}

'' \nMs Pillay said anyone who committed such violations would be held to account . \n`` There is no statute of limitations so people like -LRB- Mr Assad -RRB- can go on for a very long time but one day they will have to face justice . '' \nOn Tuesday , Radhika Coomaraswamy , the UN special representative for children and armed conflict , said they had received claims that the rebel Free Syrian Army was using children as fighters . \nThe UN says more than 9,000 people have been killed since the uprising against President Assad began a year ago . \nLate on Tuesday , several Syrian dissident groups meeting in Istanbul agreed to recognize the Syrian National Council as the official representative of the Syrian people . \nThe BBC 's Jonathan Head at the gathering said none of the delegates he spoke to believed President Assad was sincere , and the Syrian opposition would never accept any deal allowing him to remain in power . \nUS Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said President Bashar al-Assad would be judged by events . \nBut our correspondent says their disunity was openly on display , with constant disputes and walkouts . \nEarlier , a spokesman for UN and Arab League envoy Kofi Annan said he considered the Syrian acceptance of his six-point peace plan an `` important initial step '' but that implementation was key . \nMr Annan - currently in Beijing where he has held talks with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao - has written to President Assad urging him to put his commitments into immediate effect . \nUS Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said President Assad would be judged by events . \n`` Given Assad 's history of over-promising and under-delivering , that commitment must now be matched by immediate actions , '' she said . \n`` If he is ready to bring this dark chapter in Syria 's history to a close he can prove it by immediately ordering regime forces to stop firing and begin withdrawing from populated areas .

putting forward proposals to try to bring about an immediate ceasefire by both sides , access for humanitarian aid and the beginning of political dialogue . \nUN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon earlier warned of serious repercussions if the crisis in Syria is not resolved . \nSpeaking at a conference in Indonesia he warned the world could not afford to look away . \n`` We all have a responsibility to work for a resolution of this profound and extremely dangerous situation , a crisis that has potentially massive repercussions for the region and the world , '' he said . \nThe British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights gave details of army activity in the Khalidiya district of Homs and activists have also reported shelling in Rastan , north of Homs , and at Qalat Mudiq , northwest of Hama . \nSyria restricts access to foreign media which often makes it impossible to independently verify reports coming out of the country . \nThe UN says more than 8,000 people have been killed in the year-long uprising , while tens of thousands of people have fled their homes . \nOn Tuesday Russia warned Syria 's leadership it was making `` a lot of mistakes '' , signalling Moscow may be hardening its stance on Damascus . \nRussia is a key ally of Syria and , along with China , has twice thwarted attempts to agree to a UN resolution condemning Mr Assad 's actions . \nBut observers believe Moscow 's patience with Damascus has been wearing thin . \nMeanwhile the US campaign group Human Rights Watch -LRB- HRW -RRB- accused elements of Syria 's armed opposition of carrying out serious human rights abuses , including kidnapping , torture and execution . \nThe opposition Syrian National Council said in a statement that it `` deplores the reported incidents of human rights violations by armed opposition groups in Syria '' and it is working to ensure `` abuse does not happen in the fight for freedom '' . \nHRW has frequently accused Syria 's government of abuse over the past year of conflict . \nThe Syrian government has been trying to suppress an uprising inspired by events in Tunisia , Egypt and Libya . \nThe UN says thousands have been killed in the crackdown , and that many more have been detained and displaced . \nThe Syrian government says hundreds of security forces personnel have also died combating `` armed terrorist gangs '' . \nThe family of President Bashar al-Assad has been in power since his father , Hafez , took over in a coup in 1970 . \nThe country underwent some liberalisation after Bashar became president in 2000 , but the pace of change soon slowed , if not reversed . \nCritics are imprisoned , domestic media are tightly controlled , and economic policies often benefit the elite . \nThe country 's human rights record is among the worst in the world . \nSyria is a country of 21 million people with a Sunni Muslim majority -LRB- 74 % -RRB- and significant minorities of Alawites - the Shia heterodox sect to which Mr Assad belongs - and Christians . \nMr Assad promotes a secular identity for the country , but he has concentrated power in the hands of family and other Alawites . \nProtests have generally been biggest in Sunni-dominated areas . \nUnder the sanctions imposed by the Arab League , US and EU , Syria 's two most vital sectors , tourism and oil , have ground to a halt in recent months . \nThe IMF says Syria 's economy contracted by 2 % in 2011 , while the value of the Syrian pound has crashed . \nUnemployment is high , electricity cuts trouble Damascus , and critical products like heating oil and staples like milk powder are becoming scarce . \nPro-democracy protests erupted in March 2011 after the arrest and torture of a group of teenagers who had painted revolutionary slogans on walls at their school in the southern city of Deraa . \nSecurity forces opened fire during a march against the arrests , killing four . \nThe next day , the authorities shot at mourners at the victims ' funerals , killing another person . \nPeople began demanding the overthrow of Mr Assad . \nThe government has tried to deal with the situation with a combination of minor concessions and force . \nPresident Assad ended the 48-year-long state of emergency and introduced a new constitution offering multi-party elections . \nBut at the same time , the authorities have continued to use violence against unarmed protesters , and some cities , like Homs , have suffered weeks of intense bombardment . \nThe opposition is deeply divided . \nSeveral groups formed a coalition , the Syrian National Council -LRB- SNC -RRB- , but it is dominated by the Sunni community and exiled dissidents . \nThe SNC disagrees with the National Co-ordination Committee -LRB- NCC -RRB- on the questions of talks with the government and foreign intervention , and has found it difficult to work with the Free Syrian Army -

{"id": "279", "time": "2012-04-09", "text": "The unrest began in the southern city of Deraa in March The Syrian authorities have responded to anti-government protests with overwhelming military force since they erupted in March 2011 . \nThe protests pose the greatest challenge to four decades of Assad family rule in the country . \nHere is an overview of the uprising , in which the UN says more than 9,000 people have been killed by security forces and at least 14,000 others detained . \nIn February , the government put the death toll at 3,838 - 2,493 civilians and 1,345 security forces personnel . \nHow did the protests start ? \nThe unrest began in the southern city of Deraa in March when locals gathered to demand the release of 14 school children who were arrested and reportedly tortured after writing on a wall the well-known slogan of the popular uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt : `` The people want the downfall of the regime . '' \nThe protesters also called for democracy and greater freedom , though not President Assad 's resignation . \nThe peaceful show of dissent was , however , too much for the government and when people marched though the city after Friday prayers on 18 March , security forces opened fire , killing four people . \nThe following day , they shot at mourners at the victims ' funerals , killing another person . \nWithin days , the unrest in Deraa had spiralled out of the control of the local authorities . \nIn late March , the army 's fourth armored division - commanded by the president 's brother , Maher - was sent in to crush the emboldened protesters . \nDozens of people were killed , as tanks shelled residential areas and troops stormed homes , rounding up those believed to have attended demonstrations . \nBut the crackdown failed to stop the unrest in Deraa , instead triggering anti-government protests in other towns and cities across the country , including Baniyas , Homs , Hama and the suburbs of Damascus . \nThe army subsequently besieged them , blaming `` armed gangs and terrorists '' for the unrest . \nBy mid-May , the death toll had reached 1,000 . \nWhat do the protesters want and what have they got ? \nProtesters began somewhat cautiously by calling for democracy and greater freedom in what is one of the most repressive countries in the Arab world . \nBut once security forces opened fire on peaceful demonstrations , people demanded that Mr Assad resign . \nThe president has resolutely refused to step down , but in the few public statements he has made since March he has offered some concessions and promised reform . \nThe 48-year-long state of emergency was ended in April 2011 , while a new constitution offering multi-party elections was approved in a referendum in February 2012 . \nBut activists say that - as long as people continue to be killed - Mr Assad 's promises count for very little . \nMr Assad has made clear that he has no intention to step down End to the 48-year-old emergency law He revoked the emergency law on 21 April 2011 , but Syrian forces continued to open fire on demonstrations and detain people without arrest warrants Immediate end to extrajudicial killings and torture The president has rejected as `` false '' allegations made by the UN that Syrian security forces have committed crimes against humanity , including killings , torture , rape , imprisonment , and other forms of severe deprivation of liberty and disappearances Release of political prisoners and detained protesters Amnesties were offered to political prisoners in May 2011 , June 2011 and January 2012 . \nOfficials say thousands were released , but as many as 37,000 are still in prison , according to human rights activists Transition to a democratic , free and pluralistic society On 26 February 2012 , voters approved in a referendum a new constitution , which sees the inclusion of political parties beyond the ruling Baath Party , and drops an article making the party the `` leader of state and society '' . \nIt also limits the president to two seven-year terms . \nMr Assad has also decreed on 14 March that parliamentary elections will be held on 7 May . \nThe opposition has dismissed both the constitution and the elections Is there an organised opposition ? \nThe Syrian authorities have long restricted the activities of disparate opposition parties and activists , and they played a minor role at the start of the uprising . \nHowever , as the protests spread across the country and the government crackdown intensified , opposition groups publicly declared their support for the protesters ' demands and in October several announced the formation of a united front , the Syrian National Council -LRB- SNC -RRB- . \nSNC chairman Burhan Ghalioun wants to unite groups seeking peaceful change in Syria Led by the Paris-based dissident Burhan Ghalioun and including the Muslim Brotherhood , it aims to provide `` the necessary support for the revolution to progress and realize the aspirations of our people for the overthrow of the regime , its symbols and its head '' . \nIt hopes to offer a credible alternative to President Assad 's government and serve as a single point of contact for the international community . \nThe SNC , which is dominated by Syria 's majority Sunni Muslim community , has struggled to win over Christians and members of President Assad 's Alawite sect , who each make up about 10 % of the population and have so far stayed loyal to the government . \nThe council 's primacy has also been challenged by the National Co-ordination Committee -LRB- NCC -RRB- , an opposition bloc that still functions within Syria and is led by longstanding dissidents , some of whom are wary of the Islamists within the SNC . \nSeveral members of the SNC have also complained about its ineffectual leadership . \nThe disunity has frustrated the international community , so at the end of March 2012 all the main groups , with the exception of the NCC , put aside their differences and agreed that the SNC would be the `` formal interlocutor and formal representative of the Syrian people '' . \nThey were also united in their scepticism at the peace plan presented by the UN and Arab League envoy , Kofi Annan . \nThe opposition has also found it difficult to work with the Free Syrian Army -LRB- FSA -RRB- , a group of army defectors which is seeking to topple Mr Assad by force . \nBased in Turkey , its fighters have launched increasingly deadly and audacious attacks on security forces in the north-western province of Idlib , around the central cities of Homs and Hama , and even on the outskirts of Damascus . \nThe opposition has also found it difficult to work with the Free Syrian Army , a group of army defectors In January 2012 , residents of Zabadani , a mountain town 40km -LRB- 25 miles -RRB- north-west of the capital , said it had been `` liberated '' by FSA fighters . \nDays later , defectors seized control of Douma , a suburb 10km -LRB- six miles -RRB- from Damascus , for a few hours . \nBut in February 2012 , government forces launched an offensive on FSA strongholds in Homs . \nFSA fighters staged a `` tactical withdrawal '' on 1 March , after a nearly a month of intense bombardment in which an estimated 700 people were killed . \nTwo weeks later , troops took control of the northern city of Idlib from the FSA after four days of fighting , activists said . \nThe FSA 's leader , Riyad al-Asaad , claims to have 15,000 men under his command , though analysts believe there may be no more than 7,000 . \nThey are also still poorly armed , and many have only basic training . \nThe FSA agreed in March 2012 to abide by the terms of Kofi Annan 's peace plan , which demanded a ceasefire by all parties on 10 April . \nBut after the Syrian foreign ministry announced on 8 April that the army would not withdraw troops and tanks from populated areas until `` armed terrorist groups '' had presented written guarantees of a `` halt to all violence '' , the FSA cast doubt on the initiative . \nCol Asaad said that while the rebels were `` committed '' , they did not recognize the Assad government `` and for that reason we will not give guarantees '' . \nWhat is the international community doing ? \nSyria is a major player in the Middle East . \nAny chaos here could cause knock-on effects in countries such as Lebanon and Israel , where it can mobilise powerful proxy groups , such as the militant Hezbollah and Hamas movements . \nIt also has close ties with Shia power Iran - an arch-foe of the US , Israel and Saudi Arabia - which could potentially draw those powers into a dangerous Middle Eastern conflict . \nThe Arab League observer mission in Syria failed to halt the crackdown on dissent The Arab League initially remained silent on the issue of Syria - although it backed the Nato-led bombing campaign against Libya 's Col Muammar Gaddafi in a bid to protect civilians there . \nThe 22-member group called for an end to the violence , but cited hesitation over any action because of `` strategic and political considerations '' . \nBut in November 2011 , member states led by Qatar and Saudi Arabia surprised observers by voting to suspend Syria in an effort to force President Assad to end the crackdown . \nThe League later imposed economic sanctions when the Syrian government hesitated over allowing the deployment of an observer mission to verify its implementation of a peace initiative , which demanded the withdrawal of troops and tanks from the streets . \nDamascus eventually allowed in the observers in December 2011 , but they failed to halt the crackdown on dissent . \nIn late January 2012 , the Arab League laid out an ambitious plan of political reform , which called on President Assad to delegate power to a vice-president , to engage in proper dialogue with the opposition within two weeks , and form a government of national unity in two months . \nThe League said this should eventually lead to multi-party elections overseen by international observers . \nA week later , following a dramatic increase in violence , the League suspended its observer mission . \nThe League sought the support of the UN Security Council for its Syrian reform plan , rejected by Damascus on the grounds that it would infringe on national sovereignty . \nBut a UN resolution supporting the plan was vetoed by Russia , which has significant economic and military ties with Syria , and by China . \nIt was their second veto on Security Council action . \nMoscow has expressed concern that it would pave the way for military intervention . \nThe UN and Arab League dispatched a special envoy , Kofi Annan , to Syria in March In March 2012 , after a nearly month-long bombardment of Homs by government forces that left an estimated 700 people dead and outraged many in the international community , the UN and Arab League dispatched a special envoy , former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan , to Syria . \nHe proposed to President Assad a six-point peace plan that called for a UN-supervised ceasefire by all parties , a political process to address the `` aspirations '' of the Syrian people , the release of detainees , delivery of aid , free movement for journalists , and the right to protest . \nOn 27 March 2012 , Mr Annan said the Syrian government had agreed to accept the peace plan . \nSix days later , he told the UN Security Council that President Assad had committed to withdraw his security forces from populated areas by 10 April , with a general ceasefire within 48 hours contingent on that withdrawal . \nThough deeply sceptical , Western and Arab nations gave their backing to the initiative , while the opposition warned that it was likely a tactic by the Syrian government to prolong the crackdown on dissent . \nAs the ceasefire deadline approached , the violence continued unabated , with hundreds of people being killed in army assaults on opposition strongholds and clashes with rebels . \nThen on 8 April , the Syrian foreign ministry announced that the army would not withdraw until `` armed terrorist groups '' had presented written guarantees of a `` halt to all violence '' . \nThe rebel Free Syrian Army rejected the demand , saying its fighters did not recognize the government and would `` not give guarantees '' to lay down their arms . \nIs this a sectarian conflict ? \nSyria is a country of 21 million people with a large Sunni majority -LRB- 74 % -RRB- and significant minorities -LRB- 10 % each -RRB- of Christians and Alawites - the Shia sect to which Mr Assad belongs . \nFor years , Mr Assad has promoted a secular identity for the Syrian state , hoping to unify diverse communities in a region where sectarian conflict is rife - as seen in neighbouring Lebanon and Iraq . \nThe regime can still mobilise support , especially from minority groups and the upper classes However , he also concentrated power in the hands of his family and members of the Alawite community , who wield a disproportionate power in the Syrian government , military and business elite . \nClaims of corruption and nepotism have been rife among the excluded Sunni majority . \nAnd protests have generally been biggest in Sunni-dominated rural areas , towns and cities , as opposed to mixed areas . \nOpposition figures have stressed that they seek a `` multi-national , multi-ethnic and religiously tolerant society '' . \nBut there are fears of chaos and instability - even talk of civil war - if Mr Assad should fall . \nActivists say these fears are overblown . \nWhat is the economic fallout of the unrest in Syria ? \nMajor ethnic groups : Arabs -LRB- 90 % -RRB- , Kurds -LRB- 9 % -RRB- , Armenians , Circassians , Turkomans In June 2011 , President Assad warned Syrians that `` the most dangerous thing '' facing their country was `` the weakness or collapse '' of its economy . \nEven before the unrest , Syrians had endured decades of high unemployment , widespread poverty and rising food prices . \nNow , business , farming and trade have been hard hit by economic sanctions imposed by the Arab League , the European Union , the United States and neighbouring Turkey . \nSyria 's two most vital sectors - tourism and oil - have ground to a halt . \nThe IMF says Syria 's economy contracted by 2 % in 2011 , while the value of the Syrian pound has crashed to its lowest level in black-market trading . \nEven on the official exchange rates , the Syrian pound has plummeted by more than 60 % against the dollar . \nInflation is also increasing rapidly , with the official rate up to 11 % in March 2012 . \nUnemployment is estimated to have risen to more than 20 % since the uprising began . \nIn February 2012 , the government doubled customs duties , which analysts said would lead to smuggling and price rises . \nTowns and cities , including the capital Damascus , are suffering electricity cuts , and critical products like heating oil and staples like milk powder are scarce . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}

among them at least 30 civilians who died during Syrian army bombardment in the central province of Hama . \nHarrowing scenes were reported in the town of al-Latmana , where 17 women and eight children were said to have been crushed under the rubble of their homes in the second attack on the area in days . \nThe deaths come as a report by Human Rights Watch accused Syrian forces of carrying out more than 100 summary executions since March . \nThe report says most of the victims were civilians . \nJim Muir BBC News , Beirut Turkey is furious at the latest violence spilling over the border from Syria . \nThese are serious incidents which will exacerbate already high political tensions between Turkey and Syria . \nTurkey 's Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan is already very concerned about the conduct of the counter-insurgency in Syria . \nHe has strongly insisted on changes by the Syrian government and is gravely disappointed with his former ally , President Bashar al-Assad . \nPresident Assad is facing growing pressure from Turkey for some kind of action , perhaps involving a protected buffer zone or corridor , inside Syria . \nIt is all speculation at the moment , but this is the kind of thinking that could emerge the more we have these kinds of incidents and the more the peace process in Syria stumbles . \nIn the first of the skirmishes on the Turkish border at least two people died after people crossing from Syria into Turkey at Kilis were shot at by the Syrian army . \nThe governor of Kilis told the BBC that 18 people were also wounded . \nIn the second incident two Syrian refugees and a Turkish translator were wounded inside a refugee camp after being hit by stray bullets from clashes between Syrian rebels and troops , according to Turkey 's foreign affairs ministry . \nTurkey summoned Syria 's envoy to demand an immediate halt to such violence . \nIn a separate incident , a Lebanese cameraman for Lebanon 's Al-Jadeed television channel was shot dead amid gunfire in the border region between Syria and Lebanon 's northern Wadi Khaled district . \nAli Shaaban was killed and a colleague injured when a film crew from Al-Jadeed came under a hail of bullets from troops on the Syrian side of the border . \nLebanon 's prime minister condemned the killing of Mr Shaaban . \nThe BBC 's Jonathan Head , on the Turkey-Syria border , says the Syrian army has been careful to keep away from the border but that seems to have broken down this time . \nHe says incidents like this have inflamed emotions in Turkey and the Turkish government has almost given up on the ceasefire plan , brokered by UN-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan . \nTurkey has seen a sharp rise in the number of refugees coming over the border in the past week , and now hosts some 24,000 Syrians , including hundreds of army defectors . \nMr Annan will briefly visit Syrian refugees on the Turkish border on Tuesday , reports say . \nHowever , there are now serious doubts about whether Mr Annan 's ceasefire plan will come into effect on its Tuesday deadline . \n10 April : Government must withdraw troops and heavy weapons such as tanks from towns , cities and villages Following 48 hours : Ceasefire to be implemented on the ground with the onus on the opposition to follow the government 's lead 06:00 local time on 12 April : All forms of violence must be stopped on all sides Next step : All parties to hold talks on a political solution After having earlier agreed to Mr Annan 's plan , Damascus on Sunday called for written guarantees from rebel fighters to end attacks and a promise from foreign states not to fund them . \nIt said it did not want the rebels to exploit any troop withdrawal to reorganise and rearm themselves . \nThe rebel Free Syrian Army said although it backed the UN-Arab League truce , it refused to meet the government 's new demands . \nBrazilian diplomat Paulo Pinheiro , who is chairing a UN inquiry into the Syrian conflict , said the demands made by Syria were almost `` impossible '' to meet . \n`` I think that everybody in the world is worried that at the eve of the deadline , the government of Syria - instead of preparing to retreat - has escalated the military offensive , '' Mr Pinheiro said . \nChina on Monday called on the government and opposition in Syria to `` honor their commitment of ceasefire and withdrawal of troops '' . \nBut correspondents say Russia , Syria 's main ally , may now have to play a crucial role . \nSyrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem is in Moscow for talks . \nThe UN says more than 9,000 people have been killed in the uprising against Mr Assad 's rule which began more than a year ago . \nThe Syrian government says 2,000 security personnel have been killed in the uprising and blames the violence on `` armed gangs '' and `` terrorists '' . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}

{"id": "9", "time": "2012-07-16", "text": "By Jonathan Marcus BBC Diplomatic Correspondent Declaring a civil war could change how the outside world perceives the situation Syria 's deepening conflict has now turned into a full-scale civil war . \nThat 's the verdict of the UN 's Under-Secretary General for Peacekeeping Operations Herve Ladsous . \n`` The government of Syria has lost some large chunks of territory in several cities to the opposition , '' he says , `` and wants to retake control of these areas '' . \nThe pragmatic view is that if it looks and sounds like a civil war , then it is one . \nSyria is an internal conflict between different groups ; control over significant parts of national territory is being contested ; and the opposition aspires to take-over the running of the country , if necessary by forcefully deposing the Assad regime . \nBut , as Professor Fawaz Gerges , director of the Middle East Centre at the London School of Economics notes , `` designating the conflict as a civil war has no legal bearing '' . \nThe recognition of the crisis as a civil war matters more in terms of the perception of what is going on and what the international community can do about it . \nThe challenge is no longer President Assad versus the opposition , but Syrians battling one another and killing each other . '' \nEnd Quote Fawaz Gerges Director of the Middle East Centre at the London School of Economics `` Civil war status complicates the Syrian crisis and makes military intervention much more difficult than it already is , '' he argues . \n`` As Western politicians have repeatedly warned , how do you intervene when neighbor turns against neighbor and village against village ? '' \nSo what is to be done ? \nAs the death toll inside the country mounts , none of the available options facing potential external actors is terribly attractive . \nPersistent reports that the Syrian opposition is being armed by the Saudi and Qatari authorities seem to be borne out by their greater military effectiveness in recent weeks . \nBut Western military analysts say that while the opposition forces may now be able to give a better account of themselves , they can not yet defeat the government forces ranged against them . \nThis is still a very unequal struggle . \nI spoke to the veteran US diplomat Dennis Ross - now a senior policy analyst at the US think-tank the Washington Institute for Near East Studies . \nHis point was that we are likely to see similar consequences whatever policy outside actors choose ; Syria 's sad trajectory is already set . \n`` If we stay on the current track , '' he told me , `` the sectarian divide in the country will become unbridgeable ; we will see an increasing fragmentation of the Syrian state ; and civil war will become endemic . '' \nMr Ross , a veteran negotiator who has written a standard manual on diplomacy , suggests that there are four steps , which if taken together might alter perceptions even in Damascus . \n`` Russia plays a pivotal role , '' he says . \n`` Arab governments have to make it clear to the Russians that they can either be friends with President Assad or with the rest of the Arab world . \n`` If Russia helps with a political transition in Syria then there will be benefits for Moscow across the region . '' \nSome of the protests in Syria have taken on a more sectarian nature with religious messages on banners Groups like the Friends of Syria must also make it crystal clear that minority rights in any new Syria that emerges would be assured . \n`` The Saudis need to reach out to the Alawite community in Syria to offer them assurances , '' he told me . \nThat 's step two . \nStep three , Mr Ross argues , is to bolster the Syrian National Council 's -LRB- SNC -RRB- standing ; to have it , as he puts it , `` clearly anointed '' by the outside world . \nThis , of course , is problematic since the SNC 's imperfections are well known and it has struggled to put down strong roots inside Syria itself . \nFinally , he says serious planning must begin to establish safe havens in the northern part of Syria for fleeing refugees . \nHere too Mr Ross accepts there are problems . \nTurkey would want either a UN Security Council resolution or a Nato decision to establish such a zone , and neither is likely to be forthcoming . \nBut Dennis Ross believes that these four steps taken together could help `` to change the balance of psychology '' , not least in Moscow . \nProfessor Gerges also sees the increasing recognition of the Syrian conflict as a civil war as a deliberate attempt to telegraph a diplomatic message . \n`` My take , '' he told me , `` is that statements by UN and Western officials about Syria reaching the tipping point of all-out civil war are designed to impress on Assad 's allies , particularly the Russians , the urgency and gravity of the situation and the need to exert pressure on Assad to accept the Kofi Annan peace initiative . '' \nThe badly stalled Annan plan remains the only diplomatic template for Syria 's future . \nMany worry that events have already left it languishing in irrelevance . \nMeanwhile , events on the ground are getting ever more brutal . \n`` The challenge is no longer President Assad versus the opposition , '' says Fawaz Gerges , `` but Syrians battling one another and killing each other . \nThe decision by the International Committee of the Red Cross -LRB- the ICRC -RRB- to designate the violence in Syria as `` an internal armed conflict '' is a technical step - opening up the combatants to prosecution for war crimes if they breach the Geneva Conventions on the rules of war . \nBut in reality this threshold was crossed weeks ago with serious concerns about the shelling of civilian areas by Syrian government forces and the activities of pro-government militia units . \nA number of Western governments have already offered help to opposition groups to enable them to record what is happening and to gather evidence ; evidence that could be used in future war crimes trials . \nAt a more fundamental level , the semantic debate as to whether the violence in Syria constitutes a civil war or not is largely academic . \nThe fighting is now undeniably of a duration , intensity and geographical spread that raises serious questions about the long-term survival of the regime . \nIn the real world there are no tidy distinctions : armed insurrection ; civil war ; sectarian conflict . \nThe fighting in Syria has elements of all three . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}

'' \nBut he said it was unrealistic to expect Russia to persuade Mr Assad to step down . \n`` He will not leave power . \nAnd this is not because we are protecting him but because there is a very significant part of the Syrian population behind him , '' he said . \nMr Annan is expected to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin and Mr Lavrov during two days of talks . \nMr Annan is expected to ask Mr Lavrov to put pressure on the Syrian authorities to begin a political transition . \nThe BBC 's Steve Rosenberg in Moscow says Mr Annan knows Russia 's role is crucial for the success of his peace initiative , but there is little sign that the Kremlin is ready to do what he says . \nThe BBC 's Jim Muir says fighting has intensified in many parts of Syria Part of the reason for this is that the Russians fear even greater chaos and bloodshed post-Assad , he says . \nBut Moscow is also deeply suspicious of the West and reluctant to endorse regime change , our correspondent adds , although this could change if it decides its own economic and geopolitical interests are better served by Mr Assad going . \nUN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon is also expected to raise the Syrian issue with Chinese leaders when he arrives in Beijing for a China-Africa summit . \nChina has joined Russia in vetoing several Western-backed UN draft resolutions calling for tougher action . \nMeanwhile , the Syrian government has denied that it used heavy weapons in its attack on the village of Tremseh last Thursday . \nSyrian-led political process to address the aspirations and concerns of the Syrian people 2 . \nEnd to violence by all sides ; army troops to stop using heavy weapons and withdraw to barracks 3 . \nParties to allow humanitarian aid 4 . \nAuthorities to free political detainees 5 . \nAuthorities to ensure freedom of movement for journalists 6 . \nAuthorities to allow peaceful demonstrations Activists initially described fighting in Tremseh , which is near the city of Hama , as a massacre of dozens of civilians , but later accounts suggested most of the dead were armed rebels . \nUN observers at the scene have said Syrian forces used heavy artillery , tanks and helicopters , but Damascus has denied those allegations and says just two civilians had been killed . \nThe accusations , if proved , would mean Damascus had broken an agreement it made with Mr Annan . \nSeparately Morocco has become the latest of many countries in the region and around the world to expel its Syrian ambassador . \nThe country 's foreign ministry said in a statement that Nabih Ismail had been declared persona non grata . \nShortly afterwards Syria expelled Morocco 's ambassador in Damascus . \nSome 16,000 people are thought to have been killed since the uprising against Mr Assad 's regime began in March 2011 . \nAre you in Syria or do you have relatives there ? \nWhat is your experience of the unrest in the country ? \nIf you are happy to be contacted by a BBC journalist please leave a telephone number that we can contact you on . \nIn some cases a selection of your comments will be published , displaying your name as you provide it and location , unless you state otherwise . \nYour contact details will never be published . \nWhen sending us pictures , video or eyewitness accounts at no time should you endanger yourself or others , take any unnecessary risks or infringe any laws . \nPlease ensure you have read the terms and conditions . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}

'' \nState television said that in addition to the dead , several people on both sides were injured . \nIn January , the rebel Free Syria Army briefly seized several Damascus suburbs . \nThe latest incident follows bomb blasts in Damascus and the northern city of Aleppo over the weekend . \nThe car bomb that exploded in Aleppo on Sunday killed at least two people and injured 30 others . \nA day earlier , at least 27 people were reported to have been killed and 97 wounded in two explosions in the capital . \nState TV described the blasts as `` terrorist '' attacks . \nHowever , activists have accused the authorities of staging incidents to discredit opposition groups . \nReuters news agency on Monday reported residents of the eastern city of Deir Ezzor as saying that dozens of tanks had entered the city to try to dislodge Free Syrian Army rebels . \nOn Monday , a team of experts arrived in Syria to press Mr Annan 's proposals for a ceasefire and monitoring . \nAnnan spokesman Ahmad Fawzi told AFP : `` There are five people with expertise in peacekeeping and mediation . \nThey will be staying for as long as they are making progress to reach agreement on practical steps to implement Mr Annan 's proposals . '' \nIn some parts of Syria , rebel fighters , like these in Idlib province , openly brandish their weaponry Meanwhile , the head of the International Committee of the Red Cross -LRB- ICRC -RRB- , Jakob Kellenberger , traveled to Moscow to meet Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov . \nMr Lavrov gave `` positive indications of support ... for the initiative of a two-hour cessation of fighting on a daily basis '' , a Red Cross spokesman said . \nThe ICRC says the pause is needed for the evacuation of the wounded and to allow in food and medicine . \nMr Kellenberger added : `` I would like to note with satisfaction and gratitude that Sergei Lavrov shares our concern about these problems . '' \nRussia is a key ally of Syria and , along with China , has thwarted attempts to form a UN resolution condemning the repression . \nPresident Assad is trying to quell an increasingly armed rebellion that sprang from a fierce crackdown on peaceful pro-democracy protests a year ago . \nHe insists his troops are fighting `` armed gangs '' seeking to destabilise Syria . \nThe Syrian government has been trying to suppress an uprising inspired by events in Tunisia , Egypt and Libya . \nThe UN says thousands have been killed in the crackdown , and that many more have been detained and displaced . \nThe Syrian government says hundreds of security forces personnel have also died combating `` armed terrorist gangs '' . \nThe family of President Bashar al-Assad has been in power since his father , Hafez , took over in a coup in 1970 . \nThe country underwent some liberalisation after Bashar became president in 2000 , but the pace of change soon slowed , if not reversed . \nCritics are imprisoned , domestic media are tightly controlled , and economic policies often benefit the elite . \nThe country 's human rights record is among the worst in the world . \nSyria is a country of 21 million people with a Sunni Muslim majority -LRB- 74 % -RRB- and significant minorities of Alawites - the Shia heterodox sect to which Mr Assad belongs - and Christians . \nMr Assad promotes a secular identity for the country , but he has concentrated power in the hands of family and other Alawites . \nProtests have generally been biggest in Sunni-dominated areas . \nUnder the sanctions imposed by the Arab League , US and EU , Syria 's two most vital sectors , tourism and oil , have ground to a halt in recent months . \nThe IMF says Syria 's economy contracted by 2 % in 2011 , while the value of the Syrian pound has crashed . \nUnemployment is high , electricity cuts trouble Damascus , and critical products like heating oil and staples like milk powder are becoming scarce . \nPro-democracy protests erupted in March 2011 after the arrest and torture of a group of teenagers who had painted revolutionary slogans on walls at their school in the southern city of Deraa . \nSecurity forces opened fire during a march against the arrests , killing four . \nThe next day , the authorities shot at mourners at the victims ' funerals , killing another person . \nPeople began demanding the overthrow of Mr Assad . \nThe government has tried to deal with the situation with a combination of minor concessions and force . \nPresident Assad ended the 48-year-long state of emergency and introduced a new constitution offering multi-party elections . \nBut at the same time , the authorities have continued to use violence against unarmed protesters , and some cities , like Homs , have suffered weeks of intense bombardment . \nThe opposition is deeply divided . \nSeveral groups formed a coalition , the Syrian National Council -LRB- SNC -RRB- , but it is dominated by the Sunni community and exiled dissidents . \nThe SNC disagrees with the National Co-ordination Committee -LRB- NCC -RRB- on the questions of talks with the government and foreign intervention , and has found it difficult to work with the Free Syrian Army - army defectors seeking to topple Mr Assad by force . \nInternational pressure on the Syrian government has been intensifying . \nIt has been suspended from the Arab League , while the EU and the US have imposed sanctions . \nHowever , there has been no agreement on a UN Security Council resolution calling for an end to violence . \nAlthough military intervention has been ruled out by Western nations , there are increasing calls to arm the opposition . \nCorrespondents say a peaceful solution seems unlikely . \nSyria 's leadership seems intent on crushing resistance and most of the opposition will only accept an end to the regime . \nSome believe the expected collapse of Syria 's currency and an inability to pay salaries may be the leadership 's downfall . \nThere are fears , though , that the resulting chaos would be long-lasting and create a wider conflict . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}

'' \nIn the midst of all this , she speaks on the phone with her family every day to reassure them she is fine . \n`` I wonder why I am not afraid of being shot through the head , '' she says pointing to her forehead . \nThe Free Syrian Army has been on the offensive in several parts of the country `` But sometimes when you face death , you lose your fear .

'' \nMy apparently unenthusiastic neighbor at a concert given by Syrian hip hop group LaTlateh in Beirut seemed to be in good company . \nCrammed into a tiny , smoky concert hall , most of the unsmiling crowd was sitting at tables , and not a single person was dancing . \nThis was not a typical hip-hop concert . \nA Western observer might put the limp atmosphere down to the fact that the culture of hip-hop is still fledgling in the Arab world , its development stunted by its incompatibility with some Arab regimes . \nIn fact , hip-hop has never been so popular in the Middle East . \nMusic and revolution have always gone hand-in-hand and the Arab Spring is no exception . \nThe Syrian uprising is providing optimum conditions for straight-talking rap to flourish , and one particular Syrian band , LaTlateh , are articulating the feelings of a nation . \n`` I do n't like the music , but I like the words . \nI feel the words . \nThe lyrics really express my feelings . \nWe are n't dancing because we are listening to the lyrics , '' my neighbor said . \nLaTlateh is a Damascus-based three-piece hip-hop outfit comprising Al Sayyed Darwish , Watar and Abu Koulthoum . \nThey perform alongside producer Dab Snakkr , whose music documents the day-to-day struggle of the Syrian uprising . \n`` The situation in Syria is what motivates us to write . \nHow can we sit by and watch all the pain and suffering that is going on around us and not speak out ? '' \nIn the first few months of the revolution , so much of Syria 's cultural elite left the country , either hounded by the regime or in search of better working conditions . \nLaTlateh has garnered a huge following across the region because they remained in their base in Damascus , traveling between the embattled capital and Lebanon . \nThey write lyrics about Syrians , for a Syrian audience . \nThe boys , along with a wider group of Arab musicians , are contributing peacefully to the popular uprising through a movement called The Third Line . \nOf course there are always problems with cultural activities in Syria . \nThe regime was afraid of cultural expression '' The Third Line advocates a third alternative to the existing pro- and anti-regime dichotomy , and aims to uphold the truth and serve Syria 's national interests . \n`` Everybody has a view but there is hypocrisy on all sides . \nWe are trying to find the truth . \nThe third line is about breaking down divisions because each party is only benefiting from its own side , '' Dab Snakkr said . \nThe group want to promote freedom of expression and democracy and are against President Bashar al-Assad 's regime . \nEach member brings to the table his own interpretation of the situation in Syria , reflecting the conflicting opinions which exist in Syrian society . \nThe crisis in Syria has afforded LaTlateh a voice , but the group faced many obstacles before arriving at this point - and they are far from having overcome them all . \nAl Sayyed Darwish 's critique of early Arab hip-hop is nothing short of disparaging , and the group are keenly aware of the fact that real exposure for the Arab hip-hop scene has come with the revolution . \nWatar describes the pre-revolution hip-hop scene as weak . \nPrior to the uprisings , trying to make music in Syria 's political and financial climate was not easy . \n`` Our problems were pretty simple . \nThere was simply no support . \nWe did our first concert by paying for it ourselves , '' Watar says . \n`` We did other concerts with money from the US embassy and French cultural center - but it was only really symbolic funding . \nOf course there are always problems with cultural activities in Syria . \nThe regime was afraid of cultural expression , '' he adds . \nThe development of hip-hop in Syria has not just been limited by the political situation . \nMost Syrians ' experience of rap has been through mainstream US or British artists , rapping about issues alien to most of Syrian society . \nI stretched out my hand waiting for sustenance and pleasure I 've become like a bird chained to the wall Tomorrow when I travel and the homeland grows old , the new generation , the extinct generation , will understand that we really had no choice I have a desire to walk naturally along my road My name has become that of the free who remains incarcerated Its ironic , the regime got stuck in a street called Syria The atmosphere of the city is one of incurable faces The sky is squeezed , but there will be no revolutionary rain without stones We 've started to bury the cities and soon Qatar 's turn will come And we 've eaten so much death just so that you can stand on your feet again on Homs But there are some aspects of rap which parallel oral traditions in the Middle East - from the 1,000-year old Levantine tradition of Zajal , semi-sung , semi-spoken poetry battles akin to modern day rap battles , to the revered oral story-telling tradition of the Hakawati . \nThe situation in Syria has forced Syrian hip-hop onto the international stage . \nPolitical oppression means they can no longer perform in Syria and now LaTlateh is forced to widen its audience and travels the Middle East to perform . \n`` Syrian music is no longer cut off from the world . \nWe can now contribute as Syrians to the creative world in a way we could n't before , '' explains Abu Koulthoum . \nFor Dab Snakkr so far the uprising has meant that LaTlateh can express itself in a way they hope can be preserved , whatever the future holds for Syria . \n`` The most important thing right now is to create a space for free expression - a freedom of expression that was stifled to the point that two or three years ago we could not even imagine that a revolution would even happen . '' \n`` Whatever happens - whether the regime falls or not - we need to create this space and enlarge it .

'' \nKofi Annan : `` I will be sending a team in this weekend to pursue the discussions '' He also restated the main aims of his peace initiative - an immediate ceasefire by both sides , access for humanitarian aid , and the beginning of political dialogue . \nBBC Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen says it is an ambitious plan that at the moment looks more likely to fail than to succeed . \nMr Annan said he had urged the Security Council to speak with `` one voice '' . \nThe international community remains divided on Syria , with Russia and China both blocking UN Security Council resolutions on Syria and aid groups from 27 countries urging them to condemn the government 's use of violence . \nBut the two permanent members have backed Mr Annan 's peace mission . \nJonathan Head BBC News , Turkey-Syria border With refugees streaming across the border at a rate of up to 1,000 a day , Turkey is being forced to rethink its policy towards Syria . \nPublic anger over the reports of terrible atrocities by President Assad 's forces , and over the detention and alleged torture of two Turkish journalists , are also putting pressure on the government . \nThat may be why Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his ministers are for the first time talking openly about establishing a buffer zone , to protect civilians , inside Syria . \nIt would involve Turkish troops crossing the border to protect the buffer zone , and inevitably bring them into conflict with the Syrian army . \nThat is a very big step for Turkey to take , and it is unlikely to happen unless the flow of refugees becomes a tide of many tens of thousands , and Turkey gets a green light , if not from the UN - at least from its Western allies and the Arab League . \nMr Annan was speaking a day after the first anniversary of the country 's uprising , which has left more than 8,000 people dead . \nThe violence has continued despite a month-long observer mission sent by the Arab League in December and January . \nIts aim was to verify implementation of a now defunct peace initiative . \nFresh protests were held on Friday in cities across Syria - including Idlib in the north where the government has launched a fierce offensive against the rebel Free Syrian Army . \nMany anti-government demonstrators called for foreign military intervention . \nClashes between rebel fighters and the army were also reported in several parts of the country . \nPresident Assad insists his troops are fighting `` armed gangs '' seeking to destabilise Syria . \nThe Turkish foreign ministry on Friday issued a statement saying : `` Developments in Syria pose serious security risks for our nationals . '' \n`` Therefore it is strongly recommended that Turkish nationals currently in Syria leave and return home . '' \nThe ministry also said consular services in Damascus would end at the end of office hours next Thursday , but the consulate in the second city of Aleppo would remain open . \nTwo Turkish journalists are currently missing in Syria , and are reportedly in the hands of the security forces . \nSome reports say they have been wounded and tortured . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}
{"id": "210", "time": "2012-03-16", "text": "By Lina Sinjab BBC News , Damascus Thousands are still taking to the streets on a daily basis to call for freedom Nadine and George , whose names have been changed , are working on secret plans for civil disobedience against Bashar al-Assad . \nThey are part of a peaceful movement for change that has been lobbying against the Syrian president for a year . \nThey have so far dyed the water red in public fountains across Damascus , which they say represents the blood lost during the uprising . \nThey have also set up speakers in central squares to broadcast revolutionary songs , distributed flyers to encourage people to protest against the government , and shone lasers from top of Mount Qassioun , which overlooks the capital , calling for `` freedom '' . \nBut as the uprising enters its second year and the number of dead women and children increases , Nadine and George are having second thoughts . \nWhen I see this , how can I preach people not to take up arms - they have a right to defend themselves '' End Quote George Opposition activist `` We were going to throw eggs on pictures of the president tonight , but what would that help with all this blood ? '' \nNadine asks , looking at the latest pictures on the television of children massacred in Homs . \n`` When I see this , how can I preach people not to take up arms - they have a right to defend themselves , '' George adds . \nThey both look desperate - many activists in Syria are beginning to feel that the peaceful movement for change has reached an impasse . \nThousands of protesters are still taking to the streets on a daily basis to call for freedom , but the more violent the crackdown by security forces becomes the more opposition supporters are advocating armed resistance . \nThere are hardly any tourists in Syria . \nAt first sight , foreign visitors to Damascus would not feel much is different from last March . \nThere have , however , been dramatic changes . \nImages of the crackdown on dissent in Syria have caused outrage worldwide during the past year The capital 's streets are busy during the day , with people going to work and carrying out errands . \nBut the evenings are far quieter than usual and you can feel the tension everywhere . \nAlthough there are daily protests in various districts and suburbs of Damascus , the regime is still very much in control . \nPublic pictures of President Assad are more widespread than they were a year ago , as a result of a series of `` We love you '' campaigns run by his supporters . \nPictures of the violence and torture perpetrated by his government 's forces are meanwhile circulated over coffee inside people 's sitting rooms or around dinner tables . \nThe debate is always heated ; a political solution is needed . \nThis is the line that many here in Syria agree on , but how to proceed ? \nSitting at his desk , smoking a cigarette and mobile phone constantly ringing , Louai Hussein is the head of a new movement , Building the Syrian State . \nLouai Hussein holds the government responsible for what is happening in Syria He says the only way forward is a political solution and dialogue with the government on a peaceful transition of power . \n`` But the violence must stop first , '' Mr Hussein says . \nAlthough he holds the government responsible for what is happening in Syria , Mr Hussein fears arming the revolution will create more chaos . \nThe special envoy of the United Nations and Arab League , Kofi Annan , visited Damascus over the weekend and presented President Assad a peace initiative . \nMr Assad says a political solution will never succeed while `` terrorists groups '' are operating in the country , but Mr Hussein believes the former UN secretary general can find a solution . \n`` Mediation is the only way out . \nAll parties should be involved in a political solution . '' \nTaking up arms will be a dead end for the revolutionaries '' End Quote Bassam Youssef Secretary General , Together for Syria The rest of the opposition is split over whether to take up arms . \nMany protesters - particularly in towns and cities which have borne the brunt of the crackdown on dissent - want the international community to support the Free Syrian Army -LRB- FSA -RRB- , a rebel group led by army defectors who they say is protecting them . \nBut others believe that might only make things worse . \n`` They are armed because they are desperate and have lost hope of a political solution , not only because they are facing daily violence , '' Mr Hussein says . \n`` But if you provide them with some hope , they may give up on the military solution . '' \nBassam Youssef , another opposition figure , believes arming the opposition will only lead to a civil war . \nSeveral states have advocated arming the opposition in Syria so people can defend themselves `` Taking up arms will be a dead end for the revolutionaries , '' he says . \n`` It is the path the regime has pushed for , because it will distance the protesters from the civil nature of the revolution . '' \nMr Youssef is the secretary general of the Together for Syria movement , which was established in June and aims to achieve the end of President Assad 's rule through a transitional phase and the formation of a national unity government . \n`` The regime kept blaming the problem on armed groups , until the myth turned into reality , '' he adds . \n`` Now there are armed people within the opposition . \nThey had to because they needed to defend themselves . '' \nMr Youssef still believes that politicians and intellectuals should make efforts to convince people not to arm themselves , and that the only way out is to follow the non-violent path to revolution . \nMany in Syria , even the government 's supporters , believe there must now be a concerted effort to find a political solution . \nThe question remains , how far President Assad 's government - the most powerful side in this conflict - is willing to commit to one . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}
{"id": "76", "time": "2012-03-16", "text": "World press surprise at how Syrian conflict plays out Syrians rally in support of the regime on the first anniversary of the anti-regime revolt Many newspapers across the world are taking stock of the first year of the uprising in Syria , and judging that President Bashar al-Assad 's regime has so far come out on top . \nIn the Middle East , some papers applaud the opposition fighters for withstanding government attempts to suppress them for so long . \nOthers are surprised at how the conflict is developing into a long-term struggle that diplomacy can not influence . \nOne Russian paper editorial sees an end in sight with the eventual departure of Mr Assad , while a Chinese newspaper 's staunch opposition to outside pressure on Damascus remains undimmed . \nOne of the elements that has boosted Assad 's courage is that the West is not willing to intervene militarily in Syria , in contrast to Libya . \nAssad still has nothing to fear in this respect ... If we summarize the tragic balance-sheet of Syria 's last year , Assad and his supporters are in profit and those who revolted against him are in loss . \nHowever the real bill is being paid by the people . \nFor the opponents of the regime to stay steadfast for more than 12 months in different cities in the face of fierce military and security forces is amazing in every sense of the word . \nHowever , the question that remains is : How long will this steadfastness continue with the significant decline of Arab and international support that is being witnessed ? \nWhen the uprising started in Syria exactly a year ago , everyone knew it was going to be tough and harsh but no-one expected it to be so bloody ... Now , a year after the start of the revolution , the solution still seems to be far away , as neither the regime has crushed the revolution nor the revolution overthrown the regime . \nThe events of a whole year have proved that the Syrian people have taken an irrevocable decision to seize their freedom and dignity regardless of the sacrifices . \nThe Syrian crisis has entered the stage of attrition at all levels . \nIt is not clear how and when this could end . \nI will not feel sorry for the regime 's departure or feel happy if the opposition wins ... The exit from the Syrian crisis comes from inside Syria and not from other capitals or satellite TV channels . \nThe legitimacy of the opposition comes not from the support of Washington and its allies , but from the free will of Syrians . \nNo diplomat , even if they have Annan 's intellect , can reach a solution with Assad and other tyrants like him . \nDiplomacy can not convince the Assad regime to act contrary to its political trend since a regime that arose from violence , and continued to power through massacres , mass arrests and corruption , can not act contrary to its nature . \nThe Guardian has obtained hundreds of letters from the hacked mailbox of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad ... It gives rise to suspicions that this is a case of misinformation generated by sources close to the government - especially since the letters allegedly came straight from the president 's personal mailbox , which supposedly lacked proper security . \nAnd that is hard to believe . \nSuch regimes take security and confidentiality very seriously indeed . \nAssad showed himself as a strong figure who has the support of around half of the country 's population . \nHowever he was unable to carry out the requisite reforms in time ... In my view , ahead of the anniversary of the Syrian conflict , Russia , which unequivocally supported Assad for a long period of time , has adopted a course for his gradual removal from power . \nThe idea is for the Syrian president to retain power so that he can later give it up voluntarily . \nIt seems that the West is leaning towards the same idea . \nChina 's Huanqiu Shibao -LRB- Global Times -RRB- What Western countries want are naked interests . \nWhy else would they turn a blind eye to democratic reform in Syria and insist on overthrowing it ? \nThe scenes that occurred last year in Iraq and Libya are being repeated in Syria . \nThe Bashar regime is after all the legitimate government of a sovereign state , irrespective of whether it is good or bad . \nA country 's affairs can only be handled by that country itself and a country 's path can only be chosen by the people of that country . \nThis is a basic principle of modern international relations . \nBBC Monitoring selects and translates news from radio , television , press , news agencies and the internet from 150 countries in more than 70 languages . \nIt is based in Caversham , UK , and has several bureaux abroad . \n"}

'' \nOpening the summit , Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said : `` The Syrian regime should not be allowed at any cost to manipulate this plan to gain time . '' \nJim Muir BBC News , Beirut The Istanbul meeting faces a mass of dilemmas , contradictions and complexities , with no clear way forward . \nWestern leaders talk of the need to step up pressure on the regime and support the opposition . \nBut they have no intention of intervening militarily in any way , or even backing the rebels with weaponry . \nThe opposition is divided , and many of its fighters on the ground have been crushed by a ruthless crackdown . \nIt is under pressure to accept the peace plan of Kofi Annan . \nThe rebels know that in any talks , the balance of power will be heavily against them . \nSo there 's little reason to hope for a swift end to the violence other than on the regime 's terms . \nIt clearly believes it has little to fear from the Istanbul gathering . \nBut the BBC 's Jim Muir , in Beirut , says the Syrian government feels confident that it has little to fear from the Istanbul gathering - state television carried parts of the opening speeches from the conference live , dubbing it the `` enemies of Syria '' meeting . \nMrs Clinton called for a unified response on renewed action against Damascus should it fail to implement the Annan plan , saying `` we can not sit back and wait any longer '' . \nHowever , there remain a number of issues on which there appears little unity . \nA call by Burhan Ghalioun , leader of the main opposition Syrian National Council -LRB- SNC -RRB- , for `` security corridors '' inside Syria to allow the delivery of aid to civilians has so far not been heeded . \nThere is also serious division over arming the rebels . \nQatar and Saudi Arabia have argued strongly for such support , but most of those at the summit remain opposed . \nThey fear a flood of weapons could fuel a sectarian civil war . \nMr Ghalioun has also pressed for the SNC to be recognized as `` the sole legitimate representative of the Syrian people '' . \nBut French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said the conference had agreed to recognize it as the `` main point of contact '' . \nMr Juppe added that a deadline must be set for Syria to implement the Annan plan . \nThe head of the Arab League , Nabil al-Arabi , told the summit it should `` simultaneously call on the Security Council to take a binding decision ... to stop the violence in Syria '' . \nMrs Clinton and Mr Erdogan are both sceptical about Syria 's intentions on the Annan plan However , Russia and China have balked at Security Council resolutions and were pointedly absent in Istanbul . \nIraq is attending , although it had earlier suggested it might not . \nHowever , on Sunday Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki said he opposed arming the opposition and believed the Syrian government would survive . \nHe said : `` It has been one year and the regime did not fall , and it will not fall , and why should it fall ? '' \nThe Syrian government says it is close to ending the uprising . \nSyrian foreign ministry spokesman Jihad al-Makdissi told Syrian TV `` the battle to topple the state is over '' . \nViolence continued on Sunday , with more than 10 people reported killed , a day after more than 60 people died across the country . \nOur correspondent says that in the latest violence , activists reported attacks by security forces in areas near the Iraqi border to the east , and the Jordanian frontier to the south . \nThe UN believes at least 9,000 people have died in the year-long revolt against Mr Assad 's rule . \nThe Syrian government has been trying to suppress an uprising inspired by events in Tunisia , Egypt and Libya . \nThe UN says thousands have been killed in the crackdown , and that many more have been detained and displaced . \nThe Syrian government says hundreds of security forces personnel have also died combating `` armed terrorist gangs '' . \nThe family of President Bashar al-Assad has been in power since his father , Hafez , took over in a coup in 1970 . \nThe country underwent some liberalisation after Bashar became president in 2000 , but the pace of change soon slowed , if not reversed . \nCritics are imprisoned , domestic media are tightly controlled , and economic policies often benefit the elite . \nThe country 's human rights record is among the worst in the world . \nSyria is a country of 21 million people with a Sunni Muslim majority -LRB- 74 % -RRB- and significant minorities of Alawites - the Shia heterodox sect to which Mr Assad belongs - and Christians . \nMr Assad promotes a secular identity for the country , but he has concentrated power in the hands of family and other Alawites . \nProtests have generally been biggest in Sunni-dominated areas . \nUnder the sanctions imposed by the Arab League , US and EU , Syria 's two most vital sectors , tourism and oil , have ground to a halt in recent months . \nThe IMF says Syria 's economy contracted by 2 % in 2011 , while the value of the Syrian pound has crashed . \nUnemployment is high , electricity cuts trouble Damascus , and critical products like heating oil and staples like milk powder are becoming scarce . \nPro-democracy protests erupted in March 2011 after the arrest and torture of a group of teenagers who had painted revolutionary slogans on walls at their school in the southern city of Deraa . \nSecurity forces opened fire during a march against the arrests , killing four . \nThe next day , the authorities shot at mourners at the victims ' funerals , killing another person . \nPeople began demanding the overthrow of Mr Assad . \nThe government has tried to deal with the situation with a combination of minor concessions and force . \nPresident Assad ended the 48-year-long state of emergency and introduced a new constitution offering multi-party elections . \nBut at the same time , the authorities have continued to use violence against unarmed protesters , and some cities , like Homs , have suffered weeks of intense bombardment . \nThe opposition is deeply divided . \nSeveral groups formed a coalition , the Syrian National Council -LRB- SNC -RRB- , but it is dominated by the Sunni community and exiled dissidents . \nThe SNC disagrees with the National Co-ordination Committee -LRB- NCC -RRB- on the questions of talks with the government and foreign intervention , and has found it difficult to work with the Free Syrian Army - army defectors seeking to topple Mr Assad by force . \nInternational pressure on the Syrian government has been intensifying . \nIt has been suspended from the Arab League , while the EU and the US have imposed sanctions . \nHowever , there has been no agreement on a UN Security Council resolution calling for an end to violence . \nAlthough military intervention has been ruled out by Western nations , there are increasing calls to arm the opposition . \nCorrespondents say a peaceful solution seems unlikely . \nSyria 's leadership seems intent on crushing resistance and most of the opposition will only accept an end to the regime . \nSome believe the expected collapse of Syria 's currency and an inability to pay salaries may be the leadership 's downfall . \nThere are fears , though , that the resulting chaos would be long-lasting and create a wider conflict . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}

'' \n`` Silent joy and a fear of the unknown loom in Damascus , '' says pan-Arab daily al-Sharq al-Awsat . \nThe regime `` may not make it until the end of Ramadan . \nWho knows , it may not survive tonight ! '' \nPresident Assad has been dealt a `` death blow '' , says another al-Sharq al-Awsat commentary . \n`` The tyrant has become like a giant with his hands cut off ... -LRB- the attack -RRB- will make him follow the same path as -LRB- former Libyan leader -RRB- Gaddafi , who lived his final days alone and was killed by one of his aides .

'' \nThe predicted fall of the regime is a refrain in Arab national newspapers . \n`` This attack is full of significance and signs , '' says Qatar 's pro-government al-Watan . \n`` Foremost among them is the penetration of an agency that is not supposed to be penetrated ... It is a sign that the capital 's fall to revolutionaries is very close .

'' \nBut Syrian ruling party newspaper al-Baath is predictably defiant . \nIt says `` traitors , agents and mercenaries '' are mistaken if they think Syria will stop `` producing martyrs , brave and faithful men who are ready for sacrifice '' . \nAmong Syria 's non-Arab neighbors , Iranian hard-line conservative daily Qods says the appointment of a new defense minister , within two hours of the blast , `` points to signs of calm '' in Damascus . \nBut it warns that any collapse of the government `` will result in civil war '' . \nIran 's reformist daily Sharq acknowledges an `` unprecedented incident and a turning point '' . \nIt adds that Syrian opposition forces `` are trying to show that Kofi Annan 's ` Peace Plan ' is a failure '' . \nTurkish commentators are sombre . \nSyria is rapidly descending into civil war , says Taraf daily . \n`` Worse than that ... Syria has turned into an arena where world giants are clashing with each other .

{"id": "31", "time": "2012-07-19", "text": "By Jonathan Marcus BBC Diplomatic Correspondent Israel has accused Iran of being behind the attack in Burgas As the Syrian crisis worsens , if you thought that things in the Middle East were already complicated and unstable enough , then the attack on an Israeli tourist bus in Bulgaria has just made things that much worse . \nIsraeli security experts believe that this is just the latest - and the first successful - attack in a series of operations against Israeli targets around the world , planned by the overseas operational arm of the Lebanese group Hezbollah . \nAnd behind Hezbollah the Israelis see the hand of Iran ; an Iran smarting at a series of attacks against its nuclear scientists , widely believed to have been planned , maybe even carried out , by the Israelis . \nFor its part Hezbollah insists that it had nothing to do with the Bulgarian attack . \nBut a series of arrests - most recently in Cyprus - have given credence to Israel 's claims of a long-running Hezbollah plan to attack soft Israeli targets abroad . \nThe Burgas attack has potentially brought Israel into the frame of a crisis in which , up until now , it has been a concerned bystander . \nThe Syrian military is said to have redeployed troops from the Golan Heights to defend Damascus Indeed , the Burgas attack has the potential to exacerbate three over-lapping crises - the long-standing tensions between Israel and Hezbollah in southern Lebanon ; the growing chaos in Syria ; and the wider struggle between Israel and Iran focussed on Tehran 's nuclear program . \nThe stakes are high . \nA new regional conflagration beckons if any of the actors make a wrong move . \nIsrael has been watching events unfold in Syria with alarm , perhaps tinged with just a small measure of optimism . \nThe demise of the Assad regime - Iran 's principal Arab ally - would be a major blow to Tehran . \nIt would greatly constrain Iran 's regional ambitions . \nBut on the other hand , the Assad regime - father and son - have been known quantities . \nIsrael 's border with Syria on the Golan Heights has been its quietest frontier since the 1973 war . \nThe collapse of Syria into sectarian chaos - chaos that could well spread to Lebanon as well - is worrying Israeli political leaders and military commanders . \nThere have already been murmurings of concern at Syrian troop levels in the Golan being reduced as the regime pulls reinforcements into the center of the country . \nIsrael fears it could have an ungoverned space on its northern border akin to the growing security challenges posed by the breakdown of order in Egypt 's Sinai peninsula . \nAdd to this the fear of Syrian weapons - missiles and even chemical weapons - potentially falling into the hands of Hezbollah and it is no wonder Israeli military planners are uneasy . \nIsrael and Hezbollah in Lebanon have contrived an uneasy informal truce since Israel 's last major incursion into the country in 2006 . \nIran says its defences are prepared for any attack by Israel This operation was not a success for the Israeli military . \nHezbollah emerged battered but with its confidence enhanced . \nSince then it has dramatically built-up its ground-to-ground missile force . \nIsrael too believes that it has learned the lessons from its last military operation in Lebanon . \nBoth sides are preparing for the next round in their struggle . \nWhat links both the Syrian regime and Hezbollah in Lebanon - quite apart from their own close ties - is the patronage and support they both get from Iran . \nOf course Israel regards Iran 's nuclear program as a potential existential threat . \nIt has trained and planned for an attack against Iran 's nuclear facilities . \nUS pressure - not least the imminence of a US presidential election - tougher economic sanctions , and renewed efforts by the major players in the UN Security Council along with Germany to engage Tehran in negotiations have forestalled an Israeli attack up to now . \nBut three rounds of talks have not made any significant progress . \nIsrael is fast losing patience and Israel 's own domestic political circumstances may come into play . \nAfter the Kadima party quit the coalition a general election may be in the offing ; perhaps in early 2013 . \nCould this be a factor in determining the timing of a potential Israeli attack against Iran ? \nOf course such an attack could have dramatic consequences across the region . \nThe Burgas attack has thus added a new level of complexity to an already difficult strategic picture . \nIsrael will no doubt respond against Hezbollah ; but maybe not now . \nIt already has bigger strategic threats to worry about . \n"}

'' \nMr Annan has flown on to Qatar and will visit Turkey on Monday . \nBoth countries have taken a tough line against President Assad 's crackdown . \nSyrian troops are trying to crush an increasingly armed rebellion that sprang from a harsh crackdown on peaceful pro-democracy protests . \nThe UN says more than 7,500 people have died since unrest began a year ago . \nUK-based activist group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 58 people had been killed in clashes across Syria on Sunday . \nThe Observatory said 17 civilians and 12 rebels had died in a string of incidents in Idlib province . \nTight restrictions on independent journalists inside Syria mean the figures can not be verified . \nAlso on Sunday , gunmen in the north-western city of Aleppo killed former national boxing champion Ghiath Tayfour , Syria 's state news agency Sana reported . \nIt said an `` armed group '' opened fire on the boxer as he drove past Aleppo University . \nIt was not clear what the motive for his killing might have been . \nInternational disagreements have paralysed action on Syria , with Russia and China opposing Western and Arab calls for President Assad to stand down . \nThe US has drafted a fresh UN Security Council resolution but the state department said on Friday it was not optimistic that the text would be accepted . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}

tank seized from the military . \nThe rebels say they bombarded the base to the north of Aleppo , which had been used to launch artillery and air strikes on rebel positions in the city . \nIn Damascus , government forces launched two operations to root out rebel activists on Wednesday , killing at least 70 , the opposition has said . \nTroops reportedly went from house to house demanding to see people 's papers . \nActivists say the soldiers summarily executed many of their victims . \nSyrian state TV said `` dozens of terrorists '' surrendered or were killed in the operation . \nOpposition commanders in Aleppo said they used a tank captured from the army to bombard the Menagh air base , which lies between Aleppo and the rebel-held town of Azaz near the Turkish border . \nTheir claim was backed up by the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and an AFP news agency reporter . \nJim Muir BBC News , Beirut It 's hard to get a strategic overview of what 's happening in Aleppo , the scene of a vital battle which the regime can not afford to lose . \nBut it seems very different from what happened in Damascus , where government forces reacted swiftly and cleared armed rebels from the city in a methodical process that lasted less than a week . \nThe impression is that for the moment the initiative is with the rebels , still defending districts the government said it overran days ago , and fighting to expand . \nThat could change if the regime has been quietly massing the kind of manpower and firepower that could tilt the balance in the struggle for the city . \nBut if not , the scenario could be ominous for the regime . \nBy capturing a key checkpoint at Anadan , the rebels have opened a direct supply route to the Turkish border , from where they are reported to have received some shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles that could inhibit the regime 's air power . \nThe longer the situation remains unresolved , the stronger the rebels ' grip may become , as they pursue their goal of establishing a `` liberated area '' in Aleppo and neighbouring Idlib province to use as a springboard against the regime 's last stronghold , Damascus . \nThe commanders said government forces had been using the air base as a staging post for attacks on nearby areas . \nIt is one of the first uses of heavy weaponry by the rebels in the city , who are heavily outgunned by the military . \nThe fighting in Aleppo city appears to have settled into a stalemate . \nState TV , which had initially forecast that the city would be cleared of rebel fighters in just a few days , is now reporting only a few clashes with `` terrorist mercenaries '' . \nOn Wednesday , a prominent member of the opposition Syrian National Council , Burhan Ghalioun , who is in Paris , said they would `` automatically '' establish a headquarters in Aleppo if the city fell to the rebels . \n`` There will be nothing more that will stand in the way of the Free Syrian Army . \nHama , Homs to the outskirts of Damascus have in large part been liberated , '' he said . \nBut the tactics used by some of the rebels are proving controversial . \nVideo posted online shows rebel gunmen killing several prisoners who were said to belong to a pro-government militia in the city of Aleppo . \nThe prisoners , some of them bruised and bloodied , were put up against a wall half-naked and shot with Kalashnikov rifles . \nAmateur video shows rebels preparing to kill alleged Assad loyalists The opposition Syrian National Council has criticised rebels , and Human Rights Watch has said

Thursday , the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights published a more detailed account of the assault , saying pro-government forces arrested about 100 people and tortured them . \n`` On Thursday morning after the operation , the bodies of 43 people were recovered . \nSome of them had been summarily executed , '' the organization said in a statement . \nOther activist groups gave higher

{"id": "282", "time": "2012-08-02", "text": "By Yolande Knell BBC News , Golan Heights The shelling of villages by Syrian forces can be seen from parts of the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights The deepening crisis in Syria threatens to have a destabilising effect on all of its neighbors but Israel has a particular set of concerns . \nTechnically , the two countries have been in a state of war since 1948 . \nIsrael also continues to occupy the Golan Heights , Syrian territory which it captured in 1967 and later annexed , in a move that is not internationally recognized . \nYet under President Bashar al-Assad , there has been a long-standing truce and for the past 40 years the border between the two countries has been relatively calm . \nNow Israeli leaders are revising their strategic assessments . \nThere are worries that fleeing Syrian refugees could try to enter the Golan Heights and that Mr Assad 's missiles and chemical weapons arsenal could fall into the wrong hands . \nThe original Syrian population of the Golan is also closely following developments . \nOn top of a rocky mountain , Adeeb Safadi stands astride a disused Israeli military bunker and points out features in the green valley below . \n`` From here you can see my village , Majdal Shams , in the occupied Golan Heights . \nWe can see Syria and we can see the village that was bombed last week , '' he tells me . \nAs a university student , Mr Safadi was allowed to go to Damascus . \nHe stayed on in the Syrian capital to work until March this year when he was threatened because he had joined protests against the Assad government . \n`` The feeling was very nervous , '' he says . \nNow he is home , the fighting is getting nearer . \nFor the past few days there have been loud thuds as shells have been fired by Syrian forces just a few kilometres away across the armistice line . \n`` In the night everyone woke up because it 's so loud . \nThis was the first time that we could see the bombing here , '' Mr Safadi says . \n`` It was always far away in Homs and Damascus but last week it came too close to us . \nThe people in Majdal start to feel exactly what 's happening in Syria . '' \nSince the Syrian uprising began last year , small Friday protests against President Assad 's government have taken place in Majdal Shams , the largest Druze village in the Golan . \nHowever not everyone has joined in . \nIn fact , among the 20,000 Syrians in the Golan , who mostly follow the Druze religion , there are many staunch Assad supporters . \nThis has led to some angry confrontations on the streets . \n`` The army will succeed in crushing al-Qaeda forces and all the other forces that have tried to create chaos in the Syrian Republic , '' says 53-year-old pharmacist , Gandi Kalouni . \n`` Bashar will stay . '' \nStrong Syrian nationalist sentiment in the Golan historically meant loyalty to the Assad family . \nAs a minority group in Syria , the Druze , like the Christians , also favored its secular style of government . \nNow though , activist Wael Tarabay , believes that the brutality of Bashar al-Assad 's troops is changing attitudes . \n`` What 's going on on the ground in Syria will affect what 's going on the ground here , '' he says . \n`` Also unfortunately it 's the truth , that what 's going on here is influenced by the sectarian mentality . \n`` So if the Druze section in Syria will have a strong position against the regime , it may be automatically the same here . '' \nIn recent weeks as fighting has intensified in Syria , Israeli politicians and military generals have begun to speak of President Assad 's power slipping away and plan accordingly . \nIsrael will not sit idle and if we have information chemical agents or biological agents are about to fall into the hands of the Hezbollah we will not spare any effort to prevent it '' End Quote Danny Yatom former head of Mossad `` Syria used to be a regional superpower . \nIt now turned into a failed state with a regime that has no effective control any more over parts of the country , '' says chairman of the Middle East department at Tel Aviv University , Eyal Zisser . \n`` As far as Israel was concerned this was the devil we knew . \nWe knew it was an ally of Iran , we knew it supplied weapons to -LRB- the Lebanese militant group -RRB- Hezbollah and supported -LRB- the Palestinian militant group -RRB- Hamas but at the same time , this was a regime which kept the border with Israel very quiet for almost 40 years . \nNow there 's uncertainty .

{"id": "298", "time": "2012-08-02", "text": "By Jim Muir BBC News , Beirut Kofi Annan 's decision not to renew his mandate as special UN and Arab League envoy for Syria at the end of the month is clear recognition that the political process has failed , and that Syria 's fate will be decided by events on the ground . \nGiven his track record , had there been the slightest hope of advance on the political and diplomatic fronts , he would not have given up . \nThe UN and Arab League chiefs are now looking around to try to find a replacement . \nBut it 's hard to imagine any figure with anything approaching the stature and profile of Kofi Annan taking on the task , when the prospects for success are currently negligible . \nThe last round of international diplomacy lurched to a halt in July , when Russia and China vetoed a western-drafted resolution which would have done something to meet Mr Annan 's request for `` clear consequences '' to be imposed for non-compliance with his six-point plan . \nHe hit a similar dead end in efforts to persuade the regime and its armed opponents to call off the carnage and enter dialogue on a political solution . \nAt his last meeting with President Assad in Damascus on 9 July , the two men agreed to try to arrange localized ceasefires `` from the ground up '' in the hope of creating a constructive political climate . \nAll the most dire predictions about the consequences if the Annan plan failed , seem now to be coming true with bewildering rapidity '' That was a forlorn hope . \nThe violence redoubled , erupting for the first time in the two major cities which had so far been relatively untouched , Damascus and Aleppo . \nNine days after that last meeting , President Assad 's brother-in-law and three other top security figures , including the defense minister , were reported killed in an explosion in the capital . \nSince then , daily casualty figures have roughly doubled over previous highs . \nViolence has raged in many parts of the country - literally north , south , east and west - in addition to the two big cities . \nThe key battle is now being waged for control of Aleppo in the north , where rebel fighters have gained a strong foothold which government forces are trying - so far unsuccessfully - to dislodge . \nThe rebels have apparently managed to open a direct supply corridor to the nearby Turkish border , allowing fighters and munitions to flow in relatively unhindered - including , it is being reported , shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles which could erode the regime 's air-power advantage . \nNow there are reports that President Obama has signed a secret `` finding '' boosting covert US non-lethal support for the armed opposition . \nSyrian leader Bashar al-Assad counts Iran 's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad among his closest allies Syria has accused the US and France of openly and materially backing `` terrorists '' with communications equipment which is facilitating their `` criminal operations '' . \nIt has also accused Turkey of permitting al-Qaeda and other extremists to pass through the country and cross the border into Syria , and of allowing Israel , the US , Qatar and Saudi Arabia to set up intelligence centres there to direct the conflict . \nCertainly the trend seems to be towards growing outside involvement in what is rapidly becoming both a vicious civil war and a regional and international proxy struggle . \nOn the Syrian side of that equation , the regime already enjoys a close military relationship with Russia , and a strategic alliance with Iran . \nIranian leaders - visited earlier this week by the Syrian foreign minister - have been hinting that they and other `` friends and allies '' of the regime in Damascus would do more to help it survive if it came under mortal threat . \nPresident Ahmadinejad said Tehran would stand by Syria `` until good triumphed over evil '' . \nAll the most dire predictions about the consequences if the Annan plan failed , seem now to be coming true with bewildering rapidity . \nNo wonder he wanted out of it . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}
{"id": "21", "time": "2011-11-14", "text": "Like most Arab leaders , Jordan 's King Abdullah is still grappling with how best to respond to the growing crisis in Syria . \nBut he is now the first Arab leader to openly say President Bashar al-Assad should step down and `` make sure whoever comes behind ... has the ability to change the status quo '' . \nHis candid remarks , coupled with the Arab League 's bold suspension of Syria , are a turning point in the region 's approach to Damascus . \nSpeaking in a BBC interview during a visit to London , Jordan 's monarch said if the Syrian leader acted in `` the interests of his country , he would step down but he would also create an ability to reach out and start a new phase of Syrian political life '' . \nKing Abdullah still described Mr Assad as a leader who `` has reform in his blood . '' \nHis greatest criticism was directed at what he called `` the system '' that did not allow for reform . \n`` I think we would delude ourselves , '' he emphasised , `` in thinking that the system would change dramatically if the individual was gone . '' \nHis surprising candor comes after what he detailed as months of efforts by himself , and other leaders , to engage with an increasingly isolated Syrian president who still insists he is committed to reform . \nThousands of Syrians have fled across the border into northern Lebanon to escape the crackdown The UN says Syria 's eight-month long uprising has cost 3,500 lives , mainly protestors but also members of Syria 's security forces involved in the violent crackdown . \nThere is been no official response from Damascus yet to the king 's intervention . \nA spokesperson for the Syrian embassy in Washington , Roua Sharbaji , said : `` the Syrian president only derives his legitimacy from the Syrian people , and only the Syrian people are concerned with this matter '' . \nIn an interview with the BBC World Service , she said : `` We do expect neighbouring Arab states to play a more constructive role to help Syria overcome this crisis . '' \nThe Jordanian monarch said he had spoken twice to his neighbor earlier this year , and also sent his chief of royal court in June . \nIf Bashar has the interest of his country -LRB- at heart -RRB- he would step down '' End Quote King Abdullah of Jordan `` It became very clear to me that they were not interested in dialogue with Jordan or a lot of other countries unfortunately , '' he remarked regretfully . \nHe said the Syrian regime still believed it was in a `` fairly comfortable position and will continue to play groups off each other . '' \nHe said there still was not a `` cohesive opposition '' inside Syria because it would be `` oppressed very quickly '' . \nKing Abdullah has also come under unprecedented pressure for political reform in his own country . \nThere are still no strong calls for an end to the Hashemite monarchy but opposition groups are calling for a stronger , more representative parliament and an elected prime minister . \nKing Abdullah , who succeeded his father King Hussein in 1999 , has been talking about political reform since he came to power . \nHis critics accuse him of going too slowly and being wary of far-reaching democratic reform . \nAsked why his frequent changes of prime ministers and governments - three this year alone - had not resulted in significant reform , King Abdullah replied : `` Those who are scared of change , whether it is political or economic , have been very destructive over the past 12 years . '' \nBut he admitted he also had to `` shoulder responsibility '' . \nAs for Syria , beyond calling on President Assad to do more to bring about political change , the king admitted no-one had a clear idea of how to move forward . \n10 June : Turkish PM condemns the `` savagery '' of the response to the unrest 19 July : Qatar closes its embassy in Damascus after an attack by Assad loyalists 8 August : Saudi Arabia condemns crackdown and recalls its envoy in Damascus 10 August : US imposes new sanctions on Syrian telecom companies and banks 18 August : US , UK , Germany and France call on President Assad to step down ; US imposes full ban on oil imports 12 November : Arab League suspends Syria from the organization 14 November : Jordanian king openly urges Mr Assad to go ; EU tightens sanctions `` If there is a life after Bashar , what is it ? '' \nSpeaking of leaders across the region and beyond , he said , `` the unknown is scaring them more than the known '' . \nMr Assad 's supporters in a country comprising many ethnic and religious minoritieas also cite fears of possible chaos and collapse as a convincing reason to stick with the current order . \nKing Abdullah said concern about instability in Syria was heightened by other regional crises including the `` Iranian nuclear file '' and the absence of an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal `` which could be leading us into tremendous difficulty in 2012 '' . \nBut he was adamant that no country was seriously considering military intervention . \nHe warned that `` different countries have different agendas ... it would be playing ` Pandora 's box ' '' . \nLike all of Syria 's neighbors , Jordan is already giving refuge to thousands of Syrians fleeing across the border . \nThe king said his country would continue to `` open our arms '' to those who had to leave . \nSyria is also a critical trade route for Jordan , providing the kingdom with essential goods , including food . \nMany tribes straddle the frontier , relying on cross-border trade . \nTension between Arab neighbors can be explosive . \nBut concern over the consequences of speaking out seems to have been eclipsed by greater worry over the mounting violence next door . \nKing Abdullah said the Arab spring was `` not even half way through '' . \nHe expected `` tumultuous changes '' across the region for the next few years . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}

'' \nMr Lavrov said he had received no new proposals from France in their meeting , but that Mr Juppe had told him France was thinking about a new resolution focused on humanitarian aid . \nIn Beijing , Mr Zhai said that China did not approve of armed intervention or forcing so-called `` regime change '' in Syria . \nIn an interview posted on the Chinese foreign ministry website , he condemned violence against civilians and called for the government to respect the people 's `` legitimate '' desire for reform . \nHe also said sanctions or the threat of sanctions were `` not conducive to the appropriate resolution of this issue '' . \nA Chinese foreign ministry spokesman would not say if Mr Zhai would also meet Syrian opposition representatives during the two-day visit . \n`` I believe the message of this visit is that China hopes for a peaceful and proper resolution of the Syrian situation , and that the Chinese side will play a constructive role in the mediation , '' spokesman Liu Weimin said . \nLast week , Mr Zhai met a Syrian opposition delegation in Beijing . \nIn Syria itself , government forces are reported to have launched a new attack on the town of Deraa in the south of the country , where the rebellion first started in March last year . \nThere are also reports of violence on the eastern border with Iraq , and in Kfar Nabuda in the central Hama province , where a number of rebel soldiers are reported to have been killed , along with several civilians . \nActivists say at least 40 people were killed across the country on Thursday . \nThere are also reports of more shelling by government forces in Homs , which has along with Hama been hit by major government offensives . \nIn an interview with the BBC , Prince Hassan of Jordan said there was a danger of Syria `` subdividing '' along its various ethnic and religious lines , with each group `` afraid for their own future '' . \nHe called for `` heavyweight diplomacy '' to draw attention to the opposition within Syria , and said `` a conversation has to be held '' between the Syrian authorities and all opposition groups . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}

'' \nHeavy shelling was also reported in Homs , where the International Committee of the Red Cross -LRB- ICRC -RRB- last week tried unsuccessfully to arrange the evacuation of civilians . \nThe ICRC said on Tuesday it was returning to the city for a fresh attempt . \nEarlier , Mr Erdogan spoke of Turkey 's `` rage '' at Syria 's decision to shoot down the F-4 Phantom last Friday and described Syria as a `` clear and present threat '' . \n`` A short-term border violation can never be a pretext for an attack , '' he said . \nHe said the Turkish jet had been on a training flight , testing Turkey 's radars in the eastern Mediterranean . \nMr Erdogan said Turkey was adopting a `` common sense '' attitude , but that `` should n't be perceived as a weakness '' . \n`` Every military element approaching Turkey from the Syrian border and representing a security risk and danger will be assessed as a military threat and will be treated as a military target , '' he said . \nThe BBC 's Ian Pannell meets a family who are too afraid to take their wounded children to hospital Syria insists the F-4 Phantom was shot down inside Syrian airspace . \nNato , of which Turkey is a member , convened an emergency meeting of its ambassadors on Monday and afterwards expressed `` strong solidarity '' with Ankara . \nRelations between Syria and Turkey were already highly strained before the F-4 was shot down . \nThe jet crashed into the eastern Mediterranean and its two pilots are missing . \nThe Russian foreign ministry said on its website on Tuesday that the downing of the plane should not be seen `` as a provocation or a premeditated action '' . \nRussia is a close ally of Syria and , together with China , has blocked UN Security Council resolutions condemning Damascus for the continuing violence . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}
{"id": "28", "time": "2012-01-31", "text": "By Artyom Krechetnikov BBC Russian The Kremlin is against the call for President Assad to step down Syria 's President Bashar al-Assad has at least one ally on the UN Security Council : Russia , an ally adamant in its opposition to sanctions against Damascus . \nMany analysts believe this stance brings little benefit to Russia , and is more a product of domestic considerations and psychological complexes of the Kremlin 's ruling elite . \nLast October , Russia and China used their vetoes to stop a UN resolution that condemned the government of Mr Assad for the suppression of anti-government protests . \nNow , Moscow has once again threatened to wield its veto , demanding changes to the latest text . \nWhile Moscow does not wholly support the actions of the Syrian government , it opposes sanctions and has repeatedly stressed its opposition to even the slightest hint of intervention along the lines of that in Libya . \nThe Kremlin is also against the call for President Assad 's resignation , and insists that the blame for the crisis and thousands of civilian deaths can not be attributed to the Syrian authorities alone . \n`` We 're not ecstatic about Mr Assad , who always makes promises and does not keep his word , but we are convinced that Assad and Syrian society can talk to each other , and the political dialogue has not been exhausted , '' the Deputy Chairman of the Russian parliament 's foreign affairs committee , Konstantin Kosachev , told the BBC . \nThe draft resolution does not mention any possible military action against Syria . \nBut Russia wants to delete from it a call for Bashar al-Assad to hand over power to his deputy and a proposal to ban the sale of arms to Syria . \nRussia is a key weapons supplier for Damascus . \nProtesters in Homs step on an image of Russian PM Vladimir Putin Moscow 's most desirable outcome would appear to be saving President Assad , who would then implement some reforms . \nOn Monday Russia 's foreign ministry once again called for talks between the Syrian authorities and the opposition and suggested Moscow as a venue . \nWhile Russia insists on talks `` without preconditions '' , the Syrian opposition demands a ceasefire and an end to repression by government forces . \nOf particular concern for the West is the continuing delivery of Russian arms . \nAccording to some estimates , some 10 % of Russia 's global arms sales go to Syria , with current contracts estimated to be worth $ 1.5 bn -LRB- # 950m -RRB- . \nMoscow argues that is has not signed up to Western sanctions and has contracts with Damascus which must be honored . \nWestern observers generally see the situation in terms of geopolitical pragmatism : Syria is Russia 's long-time ally in the Middle East , and Russia maintains a naval base in the Syrian port of Tartus . \nBut Russia 's pragmatism is now being called into question . \nIt sends a simple and clear message to the population - we are strong , we are not afraid of anybody '' End Quote Alexei Vorobyov Political analyst Over the past 15 years the same scenario has been played out three times in different countries . \nAlthough with some reservations , Moscow supported first Slobodan Milosevic in Serbia , then Saddam Hussein in Iraq , and more recently Muammar Gaddafi in Libya , even though it had no means to translate that support into action , and even though the Kremlin did not want seriously to undermine its relations with the US and Europe . \nThe West achieved its aims in each case , while Russia appeared impotent and suffered political and economic losses . \n`` Russia is constantly losing allies . \nWith the exception of Belarus , Kazakhstan and Venezuela , there are practically no countries that may be called our friends , '' political analyst Alexei Vorobyov told the BBC . \nSo why are the Kremlin and foreign ministry following the same path again ? \n`` Although Putin likes the European way , he sees many parallels between himself and Assad , '' says the former head of Russia 's National Strategy Institute , Stanislav Belkovsky . \n`` It is a question of personal sympathy , and a feeling of possibly sharing the same fate . '' \nSome observers , especially from the opposition camp , are keen to suggest that Putin is mindful of the fate of Hosni Mubarak and Muammar Gaddafi , fearing that he might be next . \nBut others find such parallels too far-fetched . \nIt is difficult to imagine a civil war or military intervention in a nuclear state like Russia . \nAlexei Vorobyov has no doubt that the Kremlin 's foreign policy is largely addressed to a domestic audience . \n`` It 's not a struggle for Syria or Iran , it is a struggle against the West . \nOf course , it is just a pretend struggle . \nBut it sends a simple and clear message to the population - we are strong , we are not afraid of anybody . '' \nAmong those who shape Russian foreign policy , there is a widespread belief that if Moscow sticks to its guns it will eventually gain a strategic advantage . \nThey reason that sooner or later the West will stumble , either because of the economic crisis , or for some other reason . \nIn these circumstances , being seen as a leader of the camp rejecting Western values could bring great dividends . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}

government troops launched a ground offensive on rebels . \nSources on both sides say government troops tried to advance on several fronts after weeks of heavy shelling . \nSyrian officials said their forces were `` mopping up '' while activists said the attack had been repelled . \nMeanwhile , UN humanitarian chief Valerie Amos says she has been denied entry into Syria . \nIn a statement , Ms Amos said the refusal came `` despite my repeated requests to meet Syrian officials at the highest level to discuss the humanitarian situation and the need for unhindered access to the people affected by the violence '' . \nShe had been waiting in neighbouring Lebanon for the Syrian government 's response to her application , UN diplomats said . \nEyewitness : Jacques Beres from Medecins Sans Frontieres I ca n't really compare Homs to any other war zone I have worked in though - apart , perhaps , from Chechnya . \nI was based in a makeshift operating theater . \nEveryone is too scared to go to the state-run hospital - they are terrified of having a limb amputated , or of being kidnapped . \nOnly the Syrian army soldiers go there now . \nI operated on 90 people . \nWe could n't help those who had been injured in the chest and the head , only those with wounds to the abdomen and below . \n`` The people there are convinced that they will win . \nThey are very brave but they are also desperate at having been bombarded for so long . \nThey think they have been abandoned . \nOne of the two Western journalists still trapped in Homs is refusing to leave without injured Syrian civilians , say the Local Co-ordination Committees -LRB- LCC -RRB- , a network of activists . \nEdith Bouvier , who was seriously wounded last week in the bombardment of a makeshift media center , is asking the French ambassador to come personally and to do whatever he can , the LCC say . \nEarlier , the French government said it stood ready to evacuate Ms Bouvier and photojournalist William Daniels , who were on assignment for Le Figaro . \n`` We expect the government in Damascus to provide all the conditions for a safe and rapid evacuation , in particular an immediate ceasefire in Baba Amr , '' the French foreign ministry said in a statement . \nA Spanish journalist trapped with them , Javier Espinosa , has now escaped to Lebanon . \nAll three of them , and wounded British photojournalist Paul Conroy , were in a convoy to smuggle them out of Syria when it came under fire from Syrian forces . \nThe convoy split up , and the two French journalists were escorted back to Baba Amr . \nMr Conroy reached Lebanon on Tuesday and is now safe . \nCampaign group Avaaz , which organised the escape mission , said 13 Syrians died trying to smuggle the Westerners out of the country . \n`` Javier Espinosa risked his own rescue when he was separated as he stopped to attend to wounded activists as they were shelled , '' said Avaaz founder Ricken Patel . \nTwo journalists were killed in the shelling last week . \nExplosions echoed across Homs on Wednesday as the attack on Baba Amr began . \nOfficials in Damascus told reporters that clearing out the rebels would only take a few hours and that it had already become a mopping up operation . \nBut activist postings on the internet said the Free Syrian Army fighters had repelled repeated attacks by army forces and inflicted heavy losses . \nThe government has been reinforcing its troops around Baba Amr for some time . \nSyrian activists said at least 23 people were killed across Syria on Wednesday . \nThese figures can not be confirmed independently . \nThe BBC 's Jim Muir , in neighbouring Lebanon , says reports are circulating that the government has brought up units of the feared Fourth Armoured Division under President Assad 's brother Maher . \nFor both sides , the district has taken on symbolic significance , our correspondent says . \nUK Foreign Secretary William Hague urged Syria to abandon plans for a ground offensive and allow in humanitarian agencies , saying the assault was `` doomed to fail '' . \nThe humanitarian situation in Homs is believed to be deteriorating The US and France are leading efforts to draft a new UN Security Council resolution on the crisis , calling for an end to violence and access for aid . \nHowever , the text also suggests that Mr Assad is responsible for the crisis , Western diplomats say . \nOne diplomat told Reuters the draft had been circulated among `` a small circle of like-minded countries '' . \nThe text , which is still in its early stages , focuses on humanitarian aid for Syria , in the hope both China and Russia will back it . \nThey vetoed earlier Security Council resolutions in October and February , out of concerns that UN action could trigger Libya-style regime change . \nChina has indicated it is in favor of creating conditions for aid to be sent . \nForeign Minister Yang Jiechi told the head of the Arab League that China was willing to work with the Arab nations for '' a peaceful and proper settlement of the Syria issue '' , China 's official Xinhua news agency reported . \nChina has accused the West of pursuing `` hegemonistic ambitions '' in Syria under the guise of `` humanitarian concern '' . \nCorrespondents say it remains far from clear whether Beijing will or will not veto any new Security Council resolution . \nThe Syrian government says at least 1,345 members of the security forces have been killed combating what it calls `` armed gangs and terrorists '' , and puts the number of civilians killed at 2,493 . \nAre you in Syria ? \nDo you have friends or family in the country ? \nSend us your comments and experiences using the form below . \nSend your pictures and videos to

a center of anti-government protests - had been hit by mortars on Saturday , killing at least 15 people , and that army snipers had been deployed on rooftops . \nAfter a week under shellfire and virtual siege , conditions in Homs are reported to be getting desperate , with basic supplies running low . \nMeanwhile , Syria 's state news agency reported that the director of the Hamish military hospital in Damascus , Brigadier Dr Isa al-Kholi , had been shot dead on Saturday by an `` armed terrorist group '' outside his home in the capital 's northern Rukn al-Din district . \nThe BBC 's Jim Muir , in neighbouring Lebanon , says that although several officers of similar rank have been killed in combat in recent weeks , this is believed to be the first assassination of such a senior military figure in Damascus since the uprising against President Assad began in March . \nOn Friday , activists said at least 52 people were killed across the country by security forces , including 16 in Homs and 15 in suburbs of Damascus . \nHuman rights groups say more than 7,000 have died since March . \nThe government says at least 2,000 members of the security forces have been killed combating `` armed gangs and terrorists '' . \nThe UN General Assembly is scheduled to discuss Syria on Monday , when it will be addressed by the UN 's High Commissioner for Human Rights , Navi Pillay , but no vote on the resolution is expected by then . \nThe Syrian government blames `` armed gangs and terrorists '' for the violence There is no power of veto at the General Assembly but its resolutions have no legal force , unlike those of the Security Council . \nThe draft resolution circulated by Saudi Arabia `` fully supports '' the Arab League peace plan published last month , which called on Mr Assad to hand over power to his vice-president , and make way for the rapid formation of a national unity government including the opposition . \nWhile calling for an end to the violence by all sides , it lays blame primarily on the Syrian authorities , which are strongly condemned for `` continued widespread and systematic violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms '' . \nThe draft urges accountability for those guilty of human rights violations , but does not specifically mention the International Criminal Court . \nThere is also a request for Secretary General Ban Ki-moon to appoint a special envoy to promote a peaceful solution to the crisis - a proposal that Arab League Secretary General Nabil al-Arabi made this week . \nThe US ambassador to Syria , Robert Ford , on Friday posted satellite imagery on Facebook which he said showed heavy weaponry deployed outside urban areas , including Homs , Zabadani , Rankun and Halban . \nDigitalGlobe released this image allegedly showing tanks near the Al-Baath university complex in Homs `` When we see disturbing photos offering proof that the regime is using mortars and artillery against residential neighborhoods , all of us become even more concerned about the tragic outcome for Syrian civilians , '' he wrote . \n`` It is odd to me that anyone would try to equate the actions of the Syrian army and armed opposition groups since the Syrian government consistently initiates the attacks on civilian areas , and it is using its heaviest weapons , '' he added , referring to Russia 's belief that the rebels are equally culpable . \nThe satellite images are dated 6 February - the day the US closed its embassy in Damascus and Mr Ford left Syria , citing security concerns . \nMeanwhile , the government and rebel Free Syrian Army -LRB- FSA -RRB- , a group of army defectors , blamed each other for two bomb blasts in the city of Aleppo that killed 28 people and wounded more than 200 others . \nState television blamed the bombings on what it described as `` armed terrorist gangs '' , which it said had targeted a Military Intelligence complex and a riot police base but killed civilian bystanders , including children . \nThe BBC 's Jim Muir : `` State TV has been carrying some extremely explicit and lurid footage '' It broadcast gruesome pictures of the aftermath of the two attacks , with large craters and scattered body parts . \nThe FSA 's deputy leader told the BBC its fighters had been attacking the bases at the time , but were not responsible for the blasts . \nOpposition activists in Aleppo also blamed the government , saying it was trying to discredit the uprising . \nThey said there had been suspicious activity by security forces around the two bases before the explosions , and noted that state TV cameras had reached the sites within minutes . \nUS officials are reported to believe that two recent bombings in Damascus were carried out by militants from al-Qaeda in Iraq , and that the Sunni extremist group was also likely behind the attacks in Aleppo . \nThe officials cited US intelligence reports , which appeared to support President Assad 's accusation that al-Qaeda was involved in attacks on Syrian government forces , according to the McClatchy Newspapers . \nThe overall leader of al-Qaeda , Ayman Zawahiri , was believed to have authorised al-Qaeda in Iraq 's operations in Syria , the officials said . \n`` This was Zawahiri basically taking the shackles off , '' one added . \nOur correspondent says that such a development would not likely be welcomed by the bulk of the opposition movement , which has struggled for months to keep the uprising confined to peaceful massed protests . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}

{"id": "218", "time": "2012-02-10", "text": "Analysis : Syria 's complex and bloody crisis By Jim Muir BBC News , Beirut The crackdown is aimed at bringing key centres back under government control There are few certainties or even probabilities in the complex and bloody crisis in which Syria is now mired . \nIt is uncharted terrain for all - the regime itself , its population , its fellow Arab states , non-Arab neighbors Turkey and Israel , and the concerned outside world . \nHuge issues are at stake in the deepening struggle . \nThe collapse of the regime and a descent into chaos , in a country where sectarian and ethnic fault lines converge , would have huge repercussions in the wider region . \nIt would redraw its geopolitical map . \nIran would stand to lose a vital channel for support to its ally in Lebanon , Hezbollah . \nRussia would likely lose its most important Arab ally . \nAnd the possible emergence of a Sunni-led Syria , perhaps dominated by Islamists as seems to be happening in Egypt and elsewhere , would not necessarily be good news for the West and Israel either . \nOne thing that seems relatively safe to predict is that the regime 's current drive to crush armed rebels will continue until it has secured control of areas which had slipped out of its grasp in recent months . \nThe Free Syrian Army , patrolling near Homs , is under growing pressure It formally committed itself to that goal - at least for Homs and its province - in an interior ministry statement on Monday night . \nThe subsequent visit to Damascus by the Russian Foreign Minister , Sergei Lavrov , has clearly done nothing to curb the onslaught . \nIn fact , the campaign goes far beyond Homs and its environs . \nIt was launched a few days after the Arab League 's foreign ministers met in Cairo on 22 January and adopted a new peace plan for Syria , which called on President Bashar al-Assad to hand power to his vice-president and make way for the rapid formation of a national unity government including the opposition . \nThat implicitly scrapped an earlier Arab peace plan , adopted on 2 November , which Syria accepted and which it and Russia still support . \nThe November scheme called for an end to violence from whatever source , the withdrawal of armed forces , the deployment of Arab observers , the release of detainees , and rapid movement towards national dialogue . \nThe sudden adoption of a radically different plan , and the move to take the issue to the UN Security Council , apparently convinced Mr Assad that Syria 's powerful Arab adversaries - notably the Saudi-led Gulf states and especially Qatar - backed by Western powers , would stop at nothing to overturn his regime . \nDamascus had already accused those Arab powers of arming and financing rebel groups , with guns and money pouring into the country across porous borders from Turkey , Lebanon , Jordan and Iraq . \nSo the crackdown launched by Syrian security forces after the unveiling of the new Arab League plan is aimed at bringing key population centres back under government control , eliminating the armed opposition , and securing borders to stop the flow of weapons and money . \nIt has seen troops drive armed rebels out of the suburbs of Damascus itself , and put severe pressure on them in other places where they have taken root - Homs , Hama , Idlib , Deraa and elsewhere . \nHoms and Hama are strategically important because they control the highway between Damascus and Aleppo , the two big cities which have yet to be fully caught up in the revolt . \nHoms is also close to the Lebanese border . \nIdlib and its province in the north-west are important because they are adjacent to Turkey , where the rebel Free Syrian Army is based . \nIn recent days security forces have been on the move in towns , villages and country areas near all four borders , attacking any centres of armed resistance they can find . \nLebanese analysts well versed in Syrian affairs believe that , far from disapproving of the crackdown on armed rebels , the Russians may even have encouraged it . \nBut neither the Russians nor the regime itself can seriously think that crushing or curbing armed groups represents a solution to the entire crisis . \nMoscow is said to believe that `` armed extremist groups '' need to be eliminated because they would sabotage any compromise agreement reached through dialogue between the regime and its opponents . \nBy that reading , the current escalation would be more about affecting the balance of a future post-crisis Syria than pursuing the illusion that the entire uprising could be defeated by force , and that things would go back to how they were , as though nothing had happened . \nAs the continued defiance at Homs , Hama , Deraa and elsewhere have shown , it is not that easy . \nAlthough the escalation looks set to continue , it is not a comfortable time for Russia . \nAfter the Russian and Chinese veto of an otherwise unanimous Security Council resolution that would have adopted the second Arab League peace plan , with its call for Mr Assad to step aside , the powers that supported the torpedoed resolution are urgently seeking another way forward . \nAlthough there are no obvious answers , that process is bound to intensify and speed up the longer the bloodbath continues and the uglier it gets . \nCoalition of seven opposition factions , united against Assad regime Includes Kurds , tribal leaders , Islamists , democracy activists Formed last November after months of talks in Turkey Stated aim is to support the revolution and overthrow Assad Although external military intervention , as was seen in Libya , is being constantly ruled out , there is mounting pressure for some kind of action to halt the carnage , and ideas such as the creation of protected corridors for humanitarian aid , or safe-havens of some sort , are being increasingly discussed . \nThe creation of some kind of formal or informal coalition of powers to support the Syrian opposition has been proposed in different forms by a variety of quarters , including the US , UK , and Turkey . \nThat is far from being a straightforward proposition . \nBoth politically and militarily , the opposition is divided . \nThe main umbrella group in exile , the Syrian National Council -LRB- SNC -RRB- , has failed to unify with other opposition factions and agree on a shared platform . \nWhile it has generally supported the Free Syrian Army , it came under a blistering attack from the FSA commander , Col Riyad al-Asaad , just as the violence at Homs was reaching a crescendo . \nThe FSA itself faced a challenge from a new military body , the Supreme Military Council , set up this week under a more senior defecting officer , Gen Mohammed al-Sheikh , who has also installed himself in southern Turkey . \nBut these are wrinkles that could be smoothed out quickly under the pressure of time , events and a strong will from outside powers . \nAnd even if not , if the drive for an international consensus over Syria is abandoned , there is a strong danger from Russia 's viewpoint that the existing level of clandestine outside support to opposition rebels will be greatly stepped up , plunging the country into chaos and fragmentation , and clinching Moscow 's loss of its most important Arab ally . \nMoscow remains a key player for the regime , its opposition and at the UN The Russian calculation may be that it is better to use its undoubted influence with Damascus - with which it has a strategic relationship going back decades into Cold War and Soviet times - to play a leading role in brokering a Syrian settlement within an international consensus . \nThat is presumably why President Dmitry Medvedev , in conversations with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan this week , continued to propose the Security Council as the proper forum for elaborating an agreed strategy , despite the Russian-Chinese veto . \nEven the Syrian National Council , despite fury at the veto , has not ruled out a Russian role . \n`` Russia remains a potential mediator , '' the SNC said in its latest statement . '' \n-LRB- But it must -RRB- first use its influence on the regime in order to stop the killings immediately . '' \n`` A negotiated transition can only come afterwards , and will need to encompass the stepping aside of the head of the regime , a demand for which thousands of Syrians have died . '' \nThese two key demands are likely to be the focus of intense scrutiny as all sides consider their options under the pressure of events on the ground . \nThey imply that the regime has been defeated and must step aside - something that it is not ready to concede , apparently supported by Moscow . \nThe situation is far more complex than during the uprisings in Tunisia , Egypt and Libya . \nIn contrast to their ousted leaders , it does appear that the Assad regime still enjoys the support of significant sectors of the country 's patchwork society , increasingly polarised as the crisis deepens . \nAssad is still supported by large numbers of Syrians who fear chaos and Islamist rule By and large , his own Alawite minority apparently continues to stand with him , some no doubt fearful of the consequences of change . \nThe same seems generally to be true of other minorities , especially the Christians , with more questionable allegiance from the Kurds and Druze . \nSecular-minded and business circles within the middle classes of the majority Sunni community , especially in the two biggest cities , have also shown little enthusiasm for the revolt , which some fear might bring Islamists to the fore , especially now that armed action is increasingly in the picture . \nThe regime has also apparently been able to continue using the army and security forces in a repressive role without them going to pieces . \nThere have been individual or group defections on the ground , but not by whole units . \nWhat nobody knows - probably not even the regime itself - is how long it can go on using forces in which the rank and file are necessarily largely Sunni , to quell a largely Sunni-based revolt . \nThat may be one of the key constraints forcing the regime towards an eventual compromise . \nIf there is to be a chance of a peaceful transition , a Russian role might be vital in persuading the regime to give ground - something Moscow would likely only do if it were convinced that a balanced outcome , rather than a Western-dictated formula removing Syria from its sphere of influence , would result . \nOther formulae being explored , such as the idea of an enhanced , joint UN-Arab League observer mission and the appointment of a special envoy , would imply an international consensus and agreement to stabilise the situation . \nA UN observer mission could not be mounted without a resolution from the Security Council , which Russia and China would have to approve . \nIt could also not be deployed without Syrian approval , because observers are not mandated or equipped to fight their way in or impose anything , just to monitor , report , and hope that their presence has a calming and restraining effect . \nAs the powers consider all these complexities , the killing on the ground goes on , with every drop of blood shed - on either side - making a solution and eventual reconciliation more difficult . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}

'' \nMoscow 's long-standing position is that both the government and opposition in Syria are equally to blame for the violence and that the solution lies in bringing the two sides together for talks . \nBut so far there have been no negotiations . \nMr Kosachev made a surprisingly frank admission that his government 's policy on Syria could change abruptly . \n`` If and when we understand that the conditions for any political dialogue are exhausted , we will definitely stop preventing any further actions in the -LRB- UN -RRB- Security Council , '' he said . \n`` But we are not in that situation yet . '' \nIn a sign that the tempo of international diplomacy is quickening , Russia announced on Monday that it had offered to host talks in Moscow which the Syrian government has agreed to attend . \nBut an opposition organization , the Syrian National Council , rejected the offer saying President Assad had to resign before there could be any negotiations . \nMore defectors from the Syrian army are swelling the ranks of an armed opposition movement It is not clear so far whether Russia will use this to justify continuing support for the Assad government and a veto of the new resolution , or if it could decide dialogue is impossible and therefore let the resolution pass . \nIf ultimately Moscow does withdraw its support for President Assad , there are some who believe it could prove terminal for him . \n`` The regime would feel extremely isolated , would feel weakened and the morale of Assad supporters would decrease substantially , '' says Malik al-Abdeh , a Syrian journalist and opposition spokesman based in Britain . \n`` If there is a realisation within the regime that it is falling , that it has lost the confidence of its own allies internationally influential members of the regime will try to defect , perhaps escape to neighbouring countries and this is when the regime would probably crumble very quickly . '' \nTo compensate Russia for any loss of influence and trade in the Middle East , some analysts say countries such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates could step in . \n`` Russia 's strategic interests in the region do n't start and finish with Bashar al-Assad and in fact its strategic interests in the entire region do n't start and finish with Syria , '' says the director of the Brookings Centre in Qatar , Salman Sheikh . \n`` With regard to countries like Saudi -LRB- Arabia -RRB- and the UAE , there are certainly partnerships which can be formed and there are arms that can be sold .

the adjacent Sunni district . \nMore than 20 people have been killed in clashes which nobody doubts were related to the Syrian conflict , though there were conflicting recriminations . \nSunnis accused the Alawites and Damascus of stirring up the trouble to divert attention from Syria 's internal struggle and to warn the Sunnis against allowing Tripoli to become a rear base for the Syrian rebels , which it effectively is . \nAlawites accused the Sunnis of trying to impose a Salafi -LRB- fundamentalist -RRB- emirate and of arming and financing the Syrian Sunnis . \nRifaat Eid even suggested that the only solution was to invite the Syrian army in to impose order . \nMost parts of Tripoli are clearly badged with the symbols of the struggle . \nIn many areas , the black-white-and-green banner of the Syrian revolution flutters , in places more prominently than Lebanon 's own flag . \nBut in Jebel Mohsen , the posters are of Mr Assad and his father , the regime founder Hafez al-Assad , some of them featuring Rifaat Eid . \nBuildings on and near Syria Street , which runs along the front line just on the Sunni side , are pocked and battered by the various bouts of fighting . \nIt 's just a pity to see our city again having to pay for the wars of others '' End Quote Samer Annous Lebanese university lecturer People here are in no two minds about who is to blame . \n`` Every time we open up and try to work , they shoot at us again , so people close down again and run away , '' said Imad , a coffee shop owner . \n`` It 's all down to Bashar al-Assad . \nHe promised that if Syria does n't have security , he 'll set fire to the whole Middle East . \nNow he 's started with Lebanon , then it 'll be Iraq , Jordan , Turkey . \n`` He 's killing more than 100 of his own people every day . \nWe 're with the people who are being killed for no reason , '' Imad added . \nThere are widespread fears that more clashes between Alawites and Sunnis in Tripoli could spread along the sectarian and political fault lines that run through the country . \nThe Alawites may be a small minority , but they are connected to a Syrian-backed alliance which includes the Shia factions Hezbollah and Amal , as well as some Christian groups - among them the northern warlord Suleiman Franjieh in nearby Zgharta . \n`` All the elements of a civil war are present , '' said Samer Annous , a university lecturer and civil society activist . \n`` Poverty , rage among many people over things that are happening in Syria , sectarian divisions , corruption in government , the total collapse of the whole system . \n`` It 's just a pity to see our city again having to pay for the wars of others , regional powers including the Gulf states and the Syrians , '' Mr Anbnous said . \nThere is a widespread perception that a proxy struggle is already taking place , with Saudi Arabia and Qatar pouring funds into Tripoli through a proliferation of Salafi Islamist groups which have become increasingly active on the ground . \n`` It seems that there is a kind of competition between Qatar and Saudi Arabia to control the Sunni street in Lebanon , and especially in Tripoli , '' said Ziad al-Ayyoubi , another civil society activist . \n`` This is also directly related to the Syrian revolution . \nQatar is the lead country in the Gulf supporting the Syrian rebels . \nIt seems that it is using Tripoli and north Lebanon to get access to Syria . \nThere are a lot of expensive new weapons on the front line here , and they 're not left over from the civil war . '' \nOne of the best-known Salafi leaders in Tripoli , Shaikh Daai al-Islam al-Shahhal , also stressed the regional dimensions of the struggle . \n`` The end of the criminal regime in Syria is absolutely inevitable , '' he said . \n`` That will deal a huge blow to the Safavid -LRB- Iranian -RRB- project of which it is a cornerstone . \nIt will shake the Iranian and Iraqi regimes , and the allies of the Syrian regime in Lebanon . '' \nChief among those allies is Hezbollah , the most powerful force in Lebanon , including the Lebanese army . \nHezbollah 's reaction to a Syrian collapse would set the frame for what happens next in Lebanon . \nMr Shahhal said he believed a conflict was not inevitable . \n`` I think some voices within Hezbollah organization will call for preemptive steps to overturn the table in Lebanon in security terms . '' \n`` But there will also be wiser and more aware voices , which may prevail , arguing that Hezbollah should adjust to the new Lebanese reality , and content itself with being one of the effective political parties in Lebanon . \n`` If they turn back -LRB- from the Iranian project -RRB- , there would be no problems between them and us , '' Mr Shahhal said . \nHezbollah has so far been extremely restrained in its attitudes on the ground in Lebanon , while strongly supporting the Assad regime politically . \nThere is no impression at present that it is spoiling for a fight , and when 11 Lebanese Shia pilgrims were abducted by Sunni rebels in northern Syria two months ago - they are still being held - it discouraged its supporters from making trouble to press for their release . \nBut one man who believes civil war is already here is Hussein Ali , an 88-year-old Alawite shopkeeper who has lived in Tripoli all his life . \nOne of his shops was recently attacked and smashed by Sunni thugs who he believed belonged to organised Salafi groups , part of a campaign that has sent many Alawites fleeing from mixed areas . \nBut he refuses to be intimidated , and has reopened . \nHe is fiercely critical of the local Alawite leaders , who he believes are encouraging their followers on a suicidal course . \n`` The Alawite community here is small - they 'll get swallowed up like candy , '' he said . \n`` When the politics change , and the support from Syria goes , Hezbollah 's influence will go too . \nThe Alawites here seem to believe the Assad family in Syria is there forever . \nThey 've made a mistake . \nBut that does n't mean they deserve to be killed . '' \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}
{"id": "287", "time": "2012-06-29", "text": "By Imogen Foulkes BBC News , Geneva The meeting in Geneva will try to come up with a new strategy to end violence in Syria For 16 months , government troops and opposition forces have been fighting . \nThousands of civilians have died and thousands more have lost their homes in a conflict which has , UN human rights investigators say , been characterised by widespread rights violations such as torture , revenge killings and abduction . \nIn their latest report , the investigators warn that the conflict has now spread right across the country , and that sectarian violence is becoming more common . \nObviously no-one wants such a situation to continue . \nThe problem is that the big powers do not , yet at any rate , agree on how this conflict can be brought to an end . \nKofi Annan has outlined a plan for the transition of power in Syria The aim of the Geneva meeting is to try to get Kofi Annan 's six-point plan back on track . \nIn fact the plan has never really been on track . \nThe very first point on Mr Annan 's list , a ceasefire , has never been observed . \nNow Mr Annan hopes he can get agreement on a peaceful transition of power , something also envisaged in his six-point plan which called for `` an inclusive Syrian-led political process to address the legitimate aspirations and concerns of the Syrian people '' . \nMr Annan says he is optimistic that the Geneva meeting will come up with a strategy , but just hours before the senior diplomats were due to arrive , the signs were not good . \nRemember , this meeting almost did not happen at all because the big powers could not even agree on who should be invited . \nMr Annan , Russia and China had all suggested that Iran , as Syria 's neighbor and a regional power , should be at the negotiating table . \nThe United States and Britain said no , accusing Iran of unhelpful meddling in Syria 's conflict . \nIn the end Iran was left off the invitation list , and Russia agreed to come anyway , a compromise many observers viewed as a positive sign . \nBut now there is another , and even bigger , stumbling block . \nKofi Annan has apparently prepared a draft document outlining how a transition of power could happen , with the creation of a unity government followed by multi-party elections . \nBut who will be included in this unity government ? \nRussia believes the original `` inclusive , Syrian led process '' mentioned in the six-point plan means the international community does not have the right to exclude anyone , not even President Bashar al-Assad and his most fervent supporters in the government . \nMr Annan 's draft plan , however , reportedly suggests that a new transitional government `` could include members of the present government and the opposition , and other groups , but would exclude from government those whose continued presence and participation would undermine the credibility of the transition and jeopardise stability and reconciliation '' . \nBoth the United States and Britain believe that implies that President Assad would indeed be excluded - a precondition , imposed as it would be by foreign powers , that Russia almost certainly will not accept . \nBehind Russia 's reluctance to abandon President Assad completely lie Moscow 's concerns that its considerable financial interests in Syria could , perhaps literally , go up in smoke in a power change that could be chaotic and violent . \nAnd , closer to home , Russia has its own problems in the Caucasus ; the republics of Dagestan and Ingushetia are restive . \nVarious groups , including some Islamic extremists , are challenging Moscow 's power . \nShould this tension turn into something more violent , Russia does not want to see a precedent set by the situation in Syria , in which the international community is able to impose a solution which excludes the existing government . \nBut in demanding that President Assad step down , Britain and the United States must also face questions that so far they can not answer . \nWho will take power in Syria ? \nThe opposition is fragmented , and may not have the necessary unity to try to form a government . \nHow would multi-party elections be organised ? \nWould UN peacekeepers be required ? \nIf so , who would supply them ? \nBritain and the United States would be reluctant , given their long commitment to Afghanistan . \nMeanwhile , events on the ground in Syria seem to be overtaking the diplomacy in Geneva . \nThe opposition has said it will not participate in any transition which includes the current government , while President Assad has said he will not accept any solution imposed from outside . \nAnd the fighting continues , with heavy shelling reported in the suburbs of Damascus . \n`` Both sides are still convinced they can win militarily , '' said one weary diplomat in Geneva . \nUntil both sides are persuaded otherwise , the people of Syria are unlikely to get any relief . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}

{"id": "239", "time": "2012-01-18", "text": "By Barbara Plett BBC UN correspondent The Arab League monitors ' mission has been criticized as ineffective For the UN Security Council , much is at stake when it comes to the Arab League 's monitors in Syria . \nThere are two broad but opposing positions in the Council . \nBoth have tied their policies to the fate of the mission , which was given a month to observe Syria 's compliance with an Arab peace plan , and is expected to report back this week . \nIn essence , the divide is over whether the Security Council should get involved in the Syrian crisis . \nOn one side are Western nations -LRB- in particular Britain , France , the United States and Germany -RRB- which see the conflict as appalling government repression of peaceful protesters . \nThey seek a strong condemnation of Damascus and punitive action such as sanctions or an arms embargo . \nOn the other side are states led by Russia , which is intent on protecting its considerable strategic interests with a long-time Arab ally . \nBut it also believes that any Council intervention would have a hidden and counter-productive agenda of ousting the regime of President Bashar al-Assad , and fears a scenario where the UN backs one side in a civil war , as it claims happened in Libya . \nRussia is supported by countries such as China , India and South Africa , which worry that any outside intervention would make a bad situation worse . \nThey want the UN to stick to calls for political dialogue and prefer to leave the mediation in Arab hands . \nHence the importance of how the Arab League judges its mission , and what it decides to do next . \nWe might have a chance of avoiding a Russian veto only if we get a public and official request for action from the Arab League '' End Quote Gerard Araud French ambassador to the UN It might bow to growing criticism that its monitors are failing to stem the violence in Syria and refer the matter to the Security Council . \nCouncil members give considerable weight to regional requests , and Western powers believe such a clear signal could break Russian resistance to UN action . \n`` We might have a chance of avoiding a Russian veto only if we get a public and official request for action from the Arab League , '' says French Ambassador Gerard Araud . \n`` That is certainly a necessary condition , although I do n't know if it is a sufficient one . '' \nBut the Arab League could also decide to continue and bolster its mission , strengthening the hand of Russia , which has argued that the monitors are helping to stabilise the situation . \n`` We think they 've established a foothold there , '' says Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin . \n`` They 're in a better position than initially to have a restraining influence , so we hope they will continue beyond -LRB- one month -RRB- and as long as it takes for the political crisis to be brought to a halt . '' \nIt is not only the Security Council that is divided : members of the Arab League are also far apart . \nQatar is leading the drive against Syria , with quiet support from Gulf states . \nOthers like Algeria , Iraq and , according to a Western diplomat , even Egypt may oppose any referral to the Council . \nArab differences mirror the UN debate over the need for outside intervention and the desirability of regime change , even though they couch their concerns in the language of human rights . \nAnalysts say the Sunni Muslim Gulf states see the end of the Assad regime as an opportunity to weaken Syria 's Shia Muslim ally Iran , which they perceive as a growing regional threat . \nOther Arab governments see the end of the regime ushering in a sectarian and civil war that could suck in players from Israel to Iran . \nFor them , supporting the Arab mission is a way of avoiding any international action that could contribute to the break-up of Syria : not necessarily through a Libya-like Nato operation but through punishing sanctions , no-fly or buffer zones , or the creation of safe havens for the opposition . \nFor these states , the emergence of an armed resistance in Syria is every bit as alarming as the government 's repression . \nSome Arab countries say the monitors are having trouble with the armed resistance `` The feeling is that the Syrian government is in the process of making more of an effort , but the Arab League is especially having problems with the armed opposition and is not managing to penetrate neighborhoods that are today belonging to the opposition , '' Algerian Foreign Minister Mourad Medelci told journalists at the UN recently . \nGiven these divisions , the Arab League foreign ministers may be unable to come to a definitive conclusion about their monitoring mission when they meet at the weekend . \n`` The most likely -LRB- scenario -RRB- is a fuzzy outcome , '' says one Western diplomat , `` but then we would have to take stock of our options : we are not planning to let this drop . '' \nIndeed , the West can not afford to let Syria drop . \nSome of the ideas floating around here include requesting a special envoy of the Secretary General for Syria , or bringing the Qatari prime minister and Arab League secretary general to New York to brief the Security Council . \nBut that would be no substitute for the strong resolution condemning and perhaps sanctioning the Syrian government that Western states believe is long overdue . \nYet the bottom line remains that the strength of any Council action will depend on the strength of an Arab League mandate . \nAnd without a clear Arab referral to the UN , Western nations will likely face a Russian veto for anything other than the weakest of resolutions . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}

{"id": "59", "time": "2012-01-20", "text": "Robin Lustig | 10:05 UK time , Friday , 20 January 2012 Has the month-old Arab League mission to Syria been a dismal failure ? \nIs it time to admit that it has done nothing to protect Syrian civilians , or to pressure President Assad to call a halt to his security forces ' crackdown against anti-government protesters ? \nFacts are hard to come by in Syria , but the UN estimates that some 600 people have been killed in the four weeks since the Arab League observers turned up ; the US reckons the rate of killing has actually increased rather than decreased since the mission got under way . \nWhen I was in Cairo last week , I spoke to the Arab League 's secretary-general , Nabil el-Araby . \nHe readily admitted that President Assad has flagrantly ignored the agreement he signed with the Arab League -- and he left little doubt that he has made his deep displeasure known in private communications with Damascus . \nBut he does not accept the claim by some Syrian opposition groups that the mission has done more harm than good . \n-LRB- Nor does he accept that it has become , to use the word favored by one of his monitors who quit in disgust , a `` farce '' . -RRB- \nMr el-Araby says that at the very least , protesters have known that if they come out onto the streets to shout their anti-Assad slogans in the presence of Arab League observers , well , they wo n't be shot as long as the monitors are watching . \nWhat happens after they 've gone , of course , may be an entirely different matter . \nThink of the Arab League as a mini-EU . \nIt 's made up of 22 states -LRB- 21 now that Syria has been suspended -RRB- , and they 're as different as Kuwait is from Sudan , or Qatar from Egypt . \nNot one of them enjoys what you might recognize as a truly democratic form of government . \n-LRB- Post-revolution Tunisia is getting close . -RRB- \nSo when it comes to deciding what to do about Syria , it 's about as difficult as getting the EU to agree on what to do about the euro . \nLebanon , Syria 's nervous neighbor , and Iraq , which is close to Syria 's main ally , Iran , are both deeply opposed to any firmer action against the country 's current rulers . \nQatar , at the other extreme , is arguing for Arab military action to end the conflict . \nHow about referring the whole thing to the UN security council ? \nAfter all , that 's what the Arab League did over Libya , with an urgent request for a no-fly zone to be set up . \nThe request was granted -- and the rest is history . \nNever again is the line from Moscow -- and remember , Moscow has a security council veto . \nIn Cairo , Mr el-Araby is in close touch with senior Russian and Chinese diplomats , and he knows better than anyone where their red lines are . \nSo tell him there are demands that he goes back to the security council now and he asks : What 's the point , given the known positions of Russia and China ? \nAs long ago as last April , with the Syria protests less than two months old , I wrote : `` With no regional pressure for military intervention , and with no Western appetite for any more military adventures , the message for anti-government protesters in Syria seems inescapable : you 're on your own . '' \nIt may seem remarkable that eight months and several thousand deaths later , the message has n't changed . \nBut political realities are what they are : and quite apart from anything else , the Russian navy values its warm-water Mediterranean port at Tartous , just as much as the US Fifth Fleet values its home in Bahrain . \nIn other words , to use an appropriately naval metaphor , neither major power wants to rock the boat where its own strategic interests are at stake . \nThe likelihood in Syria , then , is that the military stand-off on the ground will be matched by a diplomatic stand-off at the UN . \nMy hunch is that the Arab League will issue a report that 's harshly critical of Bashar al-Assad , but will nevertheless agree to extend its observer mission 's mandate for another month . \nBelow the radar , and far from prying eyes , I suspect Western military trainers are hard at work coaching Syrian rebel defectors in camps across the border in Turkey . \nWhat the opposition need is to to be able to seize -- and hold -- some sizeable chunks of territory , and to form themselves into something resembling a cohesive political unit along the lines of the National Transitional Council in Libya . \nIf , over the coming months , the military balance swings the rebels ' way on the ground , the diplomatic balance may well follow . \nBut the initiative lies , as it has done all along , with the anti-Assad forces in Syria itself . \nAt 13:44 20th Jan 2012 , BluesBerry wrote : Turkey has been Syria s long-time ally , but is now taking an active role in attempts to get rid of Assad . \nAnkara is backing Western actions , allegedly providing a base for training Syrian rebels & even discussing a no-fly zone with the US . \nBack in 2002 Turkey , strictly following its newly-designed zero problems with neighbors foreign policy , was engaged in building strong economic , political , and social ties with neighboring countries . \nEverything was going to plan until the Arab Spring hit the region . \nTurkey faced a choice : to maintain its policy of engagement with authoritarian Arab leaders , or to take a different path . \nAt 13:45 20th Jan 2012 , BluesBerry wrote : Syria became the country which felt the full force of Ankara s u-turn when Turkey came out in support of Syria s opposition & aligned itself with the country s enemy the US . \nTurkey found itself in the frontline of the Syrian crisis last June when thousands of Syrians poured across its border , fleeing a government crackdown on the town of Jisr-al-Shughour . \nAt the time , the Red Crescent said it was caring for 30,000 refugees in camps just inside Turkish territory . \nThreats of the conflict spilling into Turkey caused Ankara to consider sending troops into Syria to create a buffer zone . \nIn the event , it was not deemed necessary , but the tensions did not help relations between the two neighbors . \nAt 13:45 20th Jan 2012 , BluesBerry wrote : Turkey claimed that the Syrian crisis could not be resolved through negotiations , that Bashar al-Assad could no longer be trusted , and started to act . \nTurkey has suspended energy cooperation with Syria and threatened to stop supplying electricity to the country . \nIt followed Arab League & announced a raft of punitive measures targeting President Bashar al-Assad s regime , provoking Damascus to suspend its free trade pact with Ankara . \nAs a result , cross border trade ground to a halt ; flourishing commercial links between northern Syria & south-eastern Turkey were severed . \nReports about American and NATO forces training Syrian rebels in the southeastern Turkish city of Hakkari added fuel to the fire . \nAt 13:46 20th Jan 2012 , BluesBerry wrote : Reports quoted in the Turkish daily Milliyet , former FBI employee Sibil Edmonds has said the bureau started a training program in Turkey back in May . \nShe also mentioned that US was involved in smuggling arms into Syria from Incirlik military base in Turkey in addition to providing financial support for the Syrian rebels . \nRussia s Kommersant daily also reported in November on operations being managed from Turkish territory . \nMeanwhile , rebel groups that attack government forces have frequently fled retribution by crossing the Turkish border . \nFinally , the most recent move from Turkey discussions with the US about a no-fly zone over Syria , in what looks suspiciously like a Libya-style scenario . \nNikolay Patrushev , head of the Security Council of Russia , said on January 13 that the United States & Turkey both NATO members were discussing the possibility of a no-fly zone . \nBack in 2003 , Turkey & Syria entered a golden era of bilateral relations , with a free trade agreement , a visa-free regime & several presidential visits . \nThe border areas became especially close families living on both sides felt they shared a common home . \nTo switch from a zero-problem policy with your neighbors to a problem-creating position , you need good reason . \nSo why has Turkey u-turned ? \nGeographically , politically & religiously , Turkey has always been the crossing point of decidedly-different worlds . \nAnkara has long harbored ambitions to be the region s powerful , leading state . \nBut the influence of Iran , Israel & Egypt complicated Turkey s path to its goal . \nThe Arab Spring has significantly shifted the years-long balance of power in the Middle East . \nTurkey has significantly increased its influence in the Middle East & North Africa . \nThe road Turkey is now following may look iffy , but no matter how dangerous its choice may be , there seems to be no way back . \nPersonally , I feel that Turkey came to a fork in the road , & chose wrong path . \nAt 15:38 20th Jan 2012 , BluesBerry wrote : President Obama voiced support for regime change in Syria on Tuesday as calls for intervention in the Middle Eastern country continued to mount . \nFollowing WH talks with Jordan s King Abdullah , Obama declared the actions of the Syrian Govt unacceptable & reiterated the US demand that President Bashar al-Assad relinquish power . \nObama praised the Jordanian monarchy for being among the first Arab states to demand Assad s ouster . \nAs in the US-NATO intervention in Libya , US is attempting to line up various dictatorial regimes close to US imperialism to provide a cover for a Western intervention . \nChief among these regimes is Qatar . \nIn an interview on the CBS news program 60 Minutes over the weekend , Qatar s ruling emir , Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani , declared his support for troops from other Arab states to be sent into Syria , ostensibly to stop the repression . \nAt 15:39 20th Jan 2012 , BluesBerry wrote : Syria s foreign ministry said that the country rejects statements of officials of Qatar on sending Arab troops to worsen the crisis and pave the way for foreign intervention . \nQatar played a key role in the US-NATO war for regime change in Libya , first serving as a leading backer of an Arab League resolution supporting foreign intervention on the pretext of setting up a no-fly zone . \nIt then took the lead in training & arming the so-called rebels in Libya , while sending large numbers of Qatari troops into the country to lead forces seeking to topple Col. Muammar Gaddafi and coordinate their ground attacks with NATO s bombing campaign . \nAt 15:40 20th Jan 2012 , BluesBerry wrote : Unmarked NATO warplanes are arriving at Turkish military bases close to Iskenderum on the Syrian border , delivering weapons from the late Muammar Gaddafi s arsenals as well as volunteers from Libya . \nIskenderum is also the seat of the Free Syrian Army , the armed wing of the Syrian National Council . \nFrench and British special forces trainers are on the ground , assisting the Syrian rebels while the CIA and US Spec Ops are providing communications equipment and intelligence to assist the rebel cause , enabling the fighters to avoid concentrations of Syrian soldiers . \nTurkey appears to be taking the lead in these operations , reportedly providing a base near the border for training Syrian insurgents and discussing with its NATO allies the possibility of imposing a no-fly zone over Syrian territory . \nCrisis is taking on the characteristics of a sectarian civil war , pitting elements of the country s Sunni majority population against the regime and its security forces , which are dominated by the Alawite Shia sect of Assad . \nIn the central city of Homs , the scene of some of the bloodiest clashes , there have been reports of killings and terror used to divide neighborhoods along sectarian lines . \nAt 15:40 20th Jan 2012 , BluesBerry wrote : The current course in Iraq coupled with the survival of an Alawite regime in Syria would create an Iranian sphere of influence stretching from western Afghanistan to the Mediterranean . \nThis would represent a fundamental shift in the regional balance of power and probably would redefine Iranian relations with the Arabian Peninsula . \nThis is obviously in Iran 's interest . \nIt is not in the interests of the United States . \nJust as Washington is pushing for regime change in Syria as part of its wider bid to prepare for war against Iran , which it views as an impediment to establishing its hegemony over the oil-rich regions of the Persian Gulf and Central Asia , so Russia and China , which have extensive interests in both Iran and Syria , have strongly opposed . \nRussia s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Wednesday that Moscow would use its veto if necessary to block any resolution in the United Nations Security Council authorizing the use of force in Syria . \nChina has indicated support for the Russian position . \nAt 15:41 20th Jan 2012 , BluesBerry wrote : Earlier this month , Russia dispatched an aircraft carrier-led naval battle group to the Syrian port of Tartus in what Moscow described as a gesture of friendship between the two countries . \nRussian officials have also dismissed US protests over a Russian ship s delivery of arms to Syria , noting that Moscow s actions while they may have cut across unilateral US and Western European sanctions have violated no international agreements . \nDo you really think that the world is as complex as you paint it to be ? \nOne is born , one lives and one dies : be one a tyrant or a pauper . \nOne of the worst inventions of man is the state . \nIt encourages competition and not cooperation . \nIt encourages rivalry rather than fraternity . \nIt also builds demigods ! \nReligion is the next worst construct of man . \nBut when religion and the state join the consequences are frequently appalling . \nIt is odd that the most religious societies are often the most barbaric . \nRather , let me rephrase that ; it is not odd at all ! \nVery few religions preach hatred , but so much evil is done in the name of religions , surely at some time this contradiction should trouble the adherents of every religion and their enthusiasts and followers . \nEvery human being matters and every human being is in the image of God is a basic tenet of the three religions of the book . \nWhy do their followers so often act contrary to their basic guiding light ? \nIn Syria why are the mullahs not counselling reconciliation and fraternity ? \nAnd if they are why are their followers ignoring them on both sides ? \nPeace is not the council of perfection it is the normal condition ! \nThe Middles East is full of puppet states that are so full of bile and hatred for their fellow man on can only despair . \nI ask again where are the arms coming from ? \nI also remind the USA that all wars end in PEACE . \nI feel it is necessary to remind the USA of this at regular intervals . \nI ask again where are the arms coming from and where is the money coming from to pay for these arms ? \nThe Syrian people will have to live with each other as they have done successfully in the past . \nThe time for talking and listening is never past ! \nIn response to # 10 `` John_from_Hendon '' Do you really think that the world is as complex as you paint it to be ? \nIn fact I believe it is far more complicated ... & therefore dangerous . \nI agree one of worst inventions of man is the state . \nIt encourages not just competition , but protectionism , & war . \nI also agree that religion is the next worst construct of man , & when state shakes hands with religion , the results are usually appalling . \nIt 's not religion that the world needs ; its spiritualism ; the realization that we are all one , & the Golden Rule . \nReligion is `` binding '' ; it fails to foster independent thought . \nAll religions by being exclusive , promoting differences , are actually contrary to spiritualism , contrary to a loving and merciful God . \nWhy do their followers so often act contrary to the book where all persons are created equal & in the image of God ? \nBecause religion is so weak that it must bind . \nIt must have commandments . \nIt must tell you what to think . \nIt 's not Syria that is the problem ; it 's not al-Assad . \nIt 's the Arab League , acting in conjunction with western powers in their attempt to remove al-Assad for another western puppet , as in Libya . \nIt is the west that is failing to preach reconciliation & peace , & what stops the west is GREED . \nWho placed the puppet-state leaders into their positions of power in the first place ? \nAs for the arms , former FBI employee Sibil Edmonds has said the bureau started a training program in Turkey back in May . \nShe also mentioned that US was involved in smuggling arms into Syria from Incirlik Military Base in Turkey in addition to providing financial support for the Syrian rebels . \nThe US can not stop its imperialism . \nWhat would it do with the hundreds of thousands of troops stationed around the globe . \nCan you imagine the unemployment rate , the insurrection ... the rebellion of persons with guns who know how to use them ? \nThe Syrian people - for the most - part support al-Assad , just as most Libyans supported Gaddafi . \nThe persons causing all this turmoil are external imports , even their Syrian Council is external to Syria . \nThank-you for your thoughtful response to my comments . \nAt 13:21 23rd Jan 2012 , ghostofsichuan wrote : Changes in the Arab world are coming slowly . . \nThe Arab league understands that any applications may also apply to themselves and most are hardly democratic in form . \nTraining and arms are good for the arms business but not good for the long term development of a country . \nNo one gives up power , it must be taken . \nIt can be taken in a number of ways . \nViolence resolves little and only creates a list to be punished when everything ends . \nOne problem is that everything must be put into some context of the desires of the West . \nLet the individuals countries work it out . \nIt may take longer than the media would like , but this is how things develop . \nWestern governments like credit for what they do but do not like blame . \nThe weak politicians of the West do their posturing with selfish motives and not by what might be a real and significant change . \nThe West is only available to promote business and banking interests . . \nthe people are of no interest . \nWelcome to my blog - I 'm Robin Lustig , and I present The World Tonight on BBC Radio 4 and Newshour on BBC World Service . \nThis is where I share thoughts on world events and point you in the direction of interesting comments I 've heard or read . \nYour comments are an essential part of making the whole thing work , so please join in . \nFor the latest updates across BBC blogs , You can stay up to date with World Tonight via these feeds . \nOurKingdom : I m not one for predictions , hence I admire those who chance it Robin Lustig , the excellent presenter of BBCs The World Tonight , has already scooped a prize , predicting in his blog on the 21st December that `` I think we ll hear less about Iran and more about Pakistan '' Iain Dale s Diary : Robin Lustig makes his predictions for 2008 . \nBrave man Liberal Conspiracy : Robin Lustig is the presenter of that late-night sanctuary , BBC Radio 4 s The World Tonight and also writes a rather tidy little blog These are some of the popular topics this blog covers . \n"}

'' \nThe suspension coincided with a major new escalation in the fighting . \nGovernment forces have moved to retake several eastern suburbs of Damascus seized by defecting soldiers , activists said . \nThey said at least 12 people had been killed and 30 injured . \nRami Abdul Rahman , head of the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights , says Saturday 's fighting was `` the most intense near the capital since the uprising began '' . \n`` The Syrian regime is trying to finish the uprising militarily now that the case is being taken to the United Nations , '' he added . \nThe Arab League says its monitors will remain at their hotels inside Syria for the time being . \nThe league 's mission was established in December to monitor Syria 's compliance with a plan to end the bloodshed . \nArab countries voted on Tuesday to extend the mission for another month . \nSince then conservative estimates say about 200 people have been killed . \nAs the violence escalated several Arab Gulf countries - including Saudi Arabia - decided to withdraw their observers . \n26 December : Arab League observers arrive in Syria , fanning out to troubled cities within days 29 December : Mission head Gen Mustafa al-Dabi says he saw `` nothing frightening '' during a visit , sparking outcry from activists 5 January : Exiled Syrian opposition leader Burhan Ghalioun tells BBC mission must prove itself or leave 11 January : Former mission member calls league mission `` a farce '' 22 January : Mission extended for another month 24 January : Gulf Co-operation Council pulls out of mission over crackdown The diplomatic focus now seems to be switching to the UN Security Council , with speculation that it may vote on a draft resolution on Syria in the coming days - although Russia still opposes the move . \nThe council met earlier this week to discuss the document drafted by Arab states , the UK , France and Germany . \nThose countries supported the league 's call for President Assad to hand power to a deputy , who would form a national unity government with the opposition within two months . \nThe draft resolution also calls for further measures if the Syrian government does not comply . \nBut Russia , an ally of Mr Assad , has said it will not back the text . \nHuman rights activist Ghias al-Jundi : `` The Arab League has prolonged the Syrian crisis '' Mr Arabi is to address the Security Council on Tuesday . \nHe has also been talking directly to Russian officials to try to persuade them to drop their opposition . \nMeanwhile , the opposition Syrian National Council -LRB- SNC -RRB- urged Syria 's diaspora across the world to stage protests outside Russia 's diplomatic missions , the AFP news agency reports . \nThe UN says more than 5,000 people have been killed since protests against the government of President Bashar al-Assad first erupted last March . \nSyrian officials say about 2,000 members of the security forces have been killed in the unrest , which has become increasingly violent as defectors from the army join the opposition . \nThese claims have not been independently verified . \nAre you in Syria or the wider region ? \nWhat is your reaction to the Arab League 's decision to suspend its mission ? \nYou can send us your views using the form below . \nIf you are happy to be contacted by a BBC journalist please leave a telephone number that we can contact you on . \nIn some cases a selection of your comments will be published , displaying your name as you provide it and location , unless you state otherwise . \nYour contact details will never be published . \nWhen sending us pictures , video or eyewitness accounts at no time should you endanger yourself or others , take any unnecessary risks or infringe any laws . \nPlease ensure you have read the terms and conditions . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}

'' \nOn a bedroom floor dozens of little children lie dead , their arms and legs strewn over one another . \nMany of their eyes are still open , bearing a look of shock and fright . \nThey are all covered with blood and obviously suffered terrible deaths . \nA girl , who is perhaps seven years old , wearing a headscarf and pink diamonte belt , lies face to face in death with a much younger boy . \nAnother little boy in a yellow jumper lies with his arms stretched out , almost cradling the head of the girl next to him . \nBlood covers both their faces and soaks their hair . \nPeople off camera are shouting : `` Oh God , oh God , oh God . '' \nAn activist in Houla told the Associated Press news agency that troops began the assault on Houla after an anti-regime demonstration following Muslim prayers on Friday . \nThe assault began with artillery shelling which killed 12 , he said - but scores more were butchered when pro-regime thugs known as `` shabiha '' then stormed the area . \nThe UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said more than 90 people had died in the 24 hours since midday on Friday . \nThe opposition Syrian National Council -LRB- SNC -RRB- said more than 110 people died and urged the UN Security Council to act , AFP news agency reported . \nAmong the dead were more than 56 children , the SNC 's Ausama Monajed told the BBC . \nHe said the regime was selecting vulnerable towns to `` teach the entire country a lesson '' . \n`` It is beyond humanity what we have seen , '' he said . \nActivists have called a day of mourning . \nHorrific video footage has emerged of dozens of dead children , covered in blood , their arms and legs strewn over one another . \nIt is unverified , but our correspondent says such images would be difficult to fake . \nIn one instance , six members of a family were killed when their house was shelled , the Observatory said . \nAt least 20 others were killed in violence elsewhere in Syria on Friday , according to activists . \nInternational media can not report freely in Syria and it is impossible to verify reports of violence . \nThe BBC 's correspondent Paul Wood and cameraman Fred Scott report from the rebel stronghold of Rastan Some of the 260 UN observers now in the country visited the Houla area after the assault , but there are no reports yet on what they found . \nEarlier , a spokesman for UN-Arab League peace envoy Kofi Annan said he was planning to visit Damascus . \nThe spokesman declined to give a date , but diplomats in Geneva told AFP that the former UN secretary general would make the trip early next week . \nMeanwhile , in a letter to the Security Council , UN chief Ban Ki-moon said the Syrian opposition controlled `` significant parts of some cities '' . \nHe said that `` established terrorist groups '' could have been behind some of the recent bomb blasts in Syria judging from the sophistication of the attacks . \nHe said the situation remained `` extremely serious '' and urged states not to arm either side in the conflict . \nEarlier this month , a bombing in Damascus left 55 dead in an attack which the government blamed on al-Qaeda . \nThe attack came amid mounting fears that the terrorist group was taking advantage of the conflict to gain a foothold . \nMr Ban said Syria `` has not ceased the use of , or pulled back , their heavy weapons in many areas '' - one of the requirements of Mr Annan 's peace plan . \n`` On several occasions , UNSMIS has heard the sound , or seen evidence , of shelling in population centres , '' he said . \nOn Thursday , a UN-mandated panel said Syrian security forces were to blame for most abuses in the conflict , which has continued despite the presence of the UN observers . \nMr Annan 's six-point peace agreement ordered a cessation of violence on 12 April . \nWhile casualties appeared to fall after the truce , the fighting quickly resumed to previous levels . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}

'' \nHe said the most important thing was to prevent the worst-case scenario of civil war . \nThere have been calls for more action to be taken in Syria to stop the violence , which has continued despite Mr Annan 's six-point peace plan . \nSpeaking in Oslo on Friday , US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton hit out at Russia saying she did not believe it was acting impartially . \n`` We know there has been a very consistent arms trade , even during the past year , coming from Russia to Syria . \nWe also believe the continuous supply of arms from Russia has strengthened the Assad regime , '' she told a news conference . \nOn Thursday , Western officials confirmed a report that a Russian cargo ship had delivered heavy weapons to the Syrian port of Tartus last weekend . \nMr Putin has insisted that Russia was not supplying Syria with arms `` that could be used in a civilian conflict '' . \nEarlier , the UN Human Rights Council said it wanted investigators to identify the perpetrators of the killings in Houla . \nNavi Pillay 's representative : `` Those who order , help or fail to stop attacks on civilians are individually criminally liable for their actions '' In the vote , 41 members voted in favor of the US-backed resolution condemning Syria , while Russia , China and Cuba voted against it . \nTwo other countries abstained and one was absent . \nResidents of the village of Taldou , in Houla , said militiamen had been sent in early last Saturday after the Syrian army unleashed a barrage of heavy weapons late on Friday in response to a local anti-government protest . \nThe UN high commissioner for human rights , Navi Pillay , said the killings in Houla may amount to crimes against humanity . \nShe said those who ordered attacks were `` individually criminally liable '' , and urged the UN Security Council to refer Syria to the International Criminal Court -LRB- ICC -RRB- , a move opposed by Russia and China . \nAs Syria is not a state party to the ICC the court has no jurisdiction to indict its citizens without a Security Council referral . \nMeanwhile , opposition activists said there had been another mass killing of civilians by pro-government militiamen . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external Internet sites 2nd June 2012 - 15:21 It 's hard to know who to believe regarding Syria . \nIt would n't be the first time our -LRB- Western -RRB- governments and media have misrepresented the facts . \nFor all its alleged faults , the Assad regime is tolerant towards religious minorities , including Christians . \nIt has also managed to keep the peace with Israel , despite the occasional tiff . \nPerhaps we should heed the idiom , `` better the devil you know ... '' 2nd June 2012 - 14:59 I 'm sure that since Assad claims innocence then he would welcome an investigative team of 10 police from each of the UN members . \n1930 people who could freely investigate who has committed these vile crimes . \nUnless , of course , he and his allies are guilty ? \n2nd June 2012 - 14:23 Arguably the UN would be dysfunctional without the permanent member vetoes . \nIt is certainly not fit for purpose with this system . \nIt was impotent to prevent war crimes in Iraq , Libya , Lebanon , Palestine , etc. . \nIt is a waste of space and should be abandoned . \n2nd June 2012 - 11:02 In my opinion the Syrians should sort this out themselves . \nIt is their affair and no one else 's . \nIntervening in it will just cause more problems . \nAll posts are reactively-moderated and must obey the house rules . \n"}

'' \nSo , in the words of Foreign Policy magazine this week : `` What the hell should we do about Syria ? '' \nOn the Today program this morning , the foreign secretary William Hague insisted that the priority remains to find some way to make the six-point peace plan drawn up by the international envoy Kofi Annan work . \nThat seems to be closer to forlorn hope than realistic policy . \nSo here are five alternative policy options , as collected by Foreign Policy from various US-based Syria analysts , which I summarise here for your benefit : Robin Yassin-Kassab , author of The Road from Damascus : `` The damage is already done . \nIt 's already too late for a happy ending . \nThe civil war is here , and the longer the stalemate lasts the deeper the trauma will be . \nThis is why I support supplying weapons to the Free Syrian Army . \nLet 's get it over with as soon as possible . '' \nRand Slim , of the New America Foundation and Middle East Institute : `` Time and again , Iranian senior officials have stressed the need for a political resolution to the Syrian crisis . \nThey have been reaching out to different groups in the Syrian opposition . \nAs the Western community keeps searching for a political solution in Syria , Iran might have some ideas about how to bring it about . '' \nBilal Saab , of the Monterey Institute of International Studies : `` Kofi Annan 's U.N.-backed plan has served its goal of exposing the Syrian regime before the world . \nBut that was all anyone could realistically hope ... It 's time for real and serious negotiations with Russia over not just Syria but a range of Middle Eastern issues of concern to both countries . \nBut the Yemenskii Variant -LRB- ie a plan similar to the one which levered President Saleh of Yemen from office -RRB- is not it . '' \nAndrew J. Tabler , of The Washington Institute for Near East Policy : `` As Syria 's conflict tragically unfolds , Washington may need to carry out surgical airstrikes or similar measures to stop regime forces from attacking civilians . \nIf those strikes are to succeed in toppling the regime , however , Washington and its allies will need to have cultivated an alternative leadership from the fragmented Syrian opposition . \nConflict will be the constant in Syria for the foreseeable future . \nBut conflict does not necessarily have to set off a generalized civil war -- the opposition on the ground has come together over one issue : Assad must go at all costs . \nThe question is how to get there . '' \nAndrew Exum , of the Center for a New American Security : `` As the United States works to facilitate a transition , it must also recognize the limitations of its leverage over Syrian actors , prepare for the likelihood of a long conflict in Syria , and work to mitigate the effects of that war on U.S. interests . \nThis means containing the conflict and discouraging human rights abuses while seeking a political solution . '' \nTake your pick -- or if you prefer , come up with an option of your own . \nA -RRB- Syria has long been the target of Western aggression . \nIraq , Syria , Lebanon , Iran , Somalia and Sudan are specified targets of US aggression -LRB- Gen. Wesley Clark , Winning Modern Wars , pg .130 . \nPoor Sunnis in Syria consider themselves oppressed . \nSaudi Arabia , Quatar , and even Turkey want to foster sectarian war in Syria to install fundamentalist Islamic rule and to thus weaken an ally of Shia Iran . \nB -RRB- The USA has for several years been engaging in massive psychological operations and propaganda that they call smart power . \nObviously biased minions , such as the State Department hireling now of Amnesty International , Ban Ki-Moon and Navi Pillay of the UN have been coopted to serve the US interests . \nSuch satellite leaders as Cameron of the UK and Harper of Canada unreflectively follow the bidding of their Washington masters . \nC -RRB- The media do the bidding of their paymasters and form public opinion . \nThe BBC received two million from the Foreign Office to expand their Arabic Service and to promote democracy -LRB- the same term used by the USA for their propaganda funding -RRB- . \nNot all the BBC has been so corrupted . \nThe notorious THE HUB continues unabated in its propaganda efforts , continuing with the assertions of a little boy . \nAmong other items , the boy said that the aggressors had beards and shaved heads . \nSomehow , BBC World and THE HUB did not mention this . \n-LRB- Beards and shaved heads belong to Salfists from the Gulf states -RRB- . \nAt 12:34 1st Jun 2012 , ghostofsichuan wrote : The West tends to have a list of pre-conditions before it will take actions involving what are determined to be `` in their interest .

{"id": "167", "time": "2012-02-09", "text": "09 February 12 16:07 GMT Associate Fellow , Royal United Services Institute Pressure is building on the Syrian army with a deepening armed uprising and growing defections . \nShashank Joshi of the Royal United Services Institute considers how the military , the foundation of Bashar al-Assad 's rule , is coping . \nLast year , late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi ordered his army to forcibly crush a burgeoning protest movement . \nThe eastern part of his army melted away immediately , and over eight months the rest progressively disintegrated to leave a rump of loyal , family-led units . \nThirty years ago to this month , President Hafez al-Assad of Syria ordered his elite forces to level the city of Hama in response to a surging Islamist rebellion . \nOnly one brigade defected . \nThomas Friedman - in his book From Beirut to Jerusalem - called this decisive brutality `` Hama rules '' . \nHafez 's successor and son , President Bashar al-Assad , is operating under `` Homs rules '' - neither those of Libya last year , nor Hama a generation ago . \nMr Assad 's security forces have been predictably resilient . \nA regime built around the Alawite sect has stacked its officer corps with co-religionists , fellow tribesmen , and family members . \nThe 4th Mechanised Division , which recently scrambled to regain control of Damascus ' suburbs , is drawn entirely from that sect . \nSo too is the Republican Guard and influential air force intelligence . \nThe Shabiha , an Alawite militia , has also been a useful auxiliary . \nIn short , Syria 's military has been turned into a ruthless confessional militia that is likely to see little future in a post-Assad Syria . \nAt the same time , no army can withstand stresses of this intensity and duration without suffering problems of morale , integrity and loyalty . \nThe country 's demography means that only Sunni conscripts can fill up the rank-and-file . \nAlthough the regime has sought to limit their role in combat , a steady trickle of defections has been unavoidable . \nThe military opposition 's commander Col Riad al-Assad , based in southern Turkey , claims to command 40,000 soldiers in his Free Syrian Army -LRB- FSA -RRB- . \nGen Mustafa al-Sheikh , the highest-ranking defector so far , has estimated the regime 's combat readiness as having fallen to `` 40 % for hardware and 32 % for personnel '' . \nHe argues that there is a grave shortage of manpower , that Sunni officers have fled or been removed , and that large parts of the army are secretly reaching out the FSA to defect . \nGen Sheikh , who has formed his own Higher Revolutionary Council to supersede the FSA , boldly predicts that `` the army will collapse during February '' . \nThat timeline is highly improbable . \nIt is as much an effort to garner international support and induce further defections , as it is an objective assessment of regime capabilities . \nEven if defections are as numerous as the opposition claims , that would still leave the ratio of government-to-rebel forces as more than four-to-one - a margin of superiority exceeding that seen in Libya , supplemented by militias , and with airpower held largely in reserve . \nAt the same time , President Assad 's force long ago passed the point at which they could hope for a final , decisive assault like that of Assad senior at Hama in 1982 . \nThe most important factor is the deepening and widening of the uprising over recent months . \nThose once wedded to peaceful protest now judge that taking up arms is the only viable option . \nOne important milestone has been the outbreak of violence this month in Syria 's second city , Aleppo . \nThe army is increasingly stretched across fronts that it did not have to worry about last year . \nIt took days to regain control of suburbs around Damascus , and the town of Zabadani - scarcely 20 miles -LRB- 32km -RRB- north-west of Damascus - was entirely seized by rebels last month . \nThese growing commitments thin out , and increase the strain on , loyal units . \nThe paradox is that more fighting means more defections , but failing to do so risks conceding territory on which the armed parts of the opposition can regroup and consolidate . \nMr Assad 's security forces do retain some advantages . \nLibya taught us that rebel control of territory can be tenuous and easily reversible . \nIndeed , Zabadani is falling back into regime hands . \nMoreover , the external support to Damascus outstrips anything that might be flowing to the FSA from Turkey , Saudi Arabia or Qatar . \nRussia has already sent tons of ammunition , and this lifeline is expected to remain open . \nGen Qassem Suleimani , commander of the elite Quds Force of Iran 's Revolutionary Guard Corps -LRB- IRGC -RRB- , has reportedly served as `` chief regime adviser and strategist '' . \nThe Guardian reports that he `` has taken up a spot in the war room '' alongside President Assad and his ruling clique . \nThere is also diplomatic succor . \nRegimes can hold together or fall apart based on perceptions . \nRussia 's angry veto of the modest UN resolution last week sent a powerful signal to those Syrian senior officers of wavering loyalty - Moscow is committed to preserving the regime in some form . \nIt is rational for officials and groups hitherto sitting on the fence to adjust their loyalty in line with Russia 's apparent commitment . \nOne hope is that even if President Assad is squeezed out , a Yemen-style stage-managed transition keeps the `` guts '' of the regime in place . \nSome vulnerable minorities who see Assad as guarantor of their safety , have compelling reasons to take a gamble on this outcome . \nA secret US diplomatic cable from Damascus in 2006 observed `` tremendous fear in the Alawite community about retribution if the Sunni majority ever regains power '' . \nAssad 's `` Homs rules '' mean that he has no strategy , only tactics : indiscriminate bombardment of a fragmented opposition , the sharpening of sectarian loyalty to force minority communities to pick sides , and outreach to foreign patrons with a stake in his survival . \nIt is hard to see how this can do anything but accelerate the militarisation of the opposition , induce greater countervailing help to the rebels from frustrated outsiders , and make it very hard for any pluralistic , democratic settlement to emerge from the wreckage . \n"}

{"id": "86", "time": "2011-10-05", "text": "China and Russia veto UN resolution condemning Syria Susan Rice walked out of the UN meeting when Syria 's envoy criticised the US China and Russia have vetoed a UN Security Council resolution condemning Syria over its crackdown on anti-government protesters . \nThe European-drafted resolution had been watered down to try to avoid the vetoes , dropping a direct reference to sanctions against Damascus . \nBut Moscow and Beijing said the draft contained no provision against outside military intervention in Syria . \nThe US envoy to the UN said Washington was `` outraged '' by the vote . \nSusan Rice , who walked out after the vote , said opposition to the resolution was a `` cheap ruse by those who would rather sell arms to the Syrian regime than stand with the Syrian people '' . \nThe result is a huge blow to European and US efforts on the Syria issue , the BBC 's Laura Trevelyan in New York says . \nMore than 2,700 people have been killed across Syria since the crackdown began in March , the UN estimates . \nThe government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad says it is in the process of introducing reforms and is speaking to members of the opposition . \nIt blames the unrest on armed gangs . \nNine countries backed the resolution in the 15-member council , while four more abstained during the vote late on Tuesday . \nLaura Trevelyan BBC News , New York Russia , an ally of Syria 's since the Cold War , has argued that a UN Security Council resolution on Syria could be used to justify military action against the government there - Moscow and Bejing say the UN resolution authorising the use of force to protect civilians in Libya was misused by Nato to bring down Col Gaddafi 's government . \nThough Western diplomats say they will not rest until the Security Council responds to the repression in Syria , this vote has exposed the deep divisions within the 15 members . \nMore than six months after the Syrian uprising began , the body supposed to promote international peace and stability has been unable to agree on a course of action . \nBut the resolution - which was drafted by France with the co-operation of Britain , Germany and Portugal - was still defeated because of the vetoes from two of the council 's five permanent members . \nThis was despite the fact that the text had been changed three times by the European allies , who had tried to accommodate Russia 's and China 's objections . \nThe resolution referred to `` targeted measures '' - instead of sanctions - if the clampdown in Syria continued . \nBut Russia 's UN Ambassador Vitaly Churkin said that draft was based on `` the philosophy of confrontation '' . \nHe said the threat of an ultimatum of sanctions against the Syrian authorities was `` unacceptable '' and that the approach went `` against the principle of a peaceful settlement of a crisis on the basis of a full Syrian national dialogue '' . \nHe repeated Moscow 's concerns that a resolution could lead to a Libyan-style foreign military intervention in Syria and said pressure should also be put on the Syrian opposition movement to refrain from violence and disassociate itself from `` extremists '' . \nBut Mr Churkin added that Moscow would like the Syrian regime to be `` quicker with implementing the promised changes '' . \nIn favor - Bosnia and Herzegovina , Colombia , France , Gabon , Germany , Nigeria , Portugal , UK , US China 's UN ambassador Li Baodong said that Beijing opposed the idea of `` interference in -LRB- Syria 's -RRB- internal affairs . '' \nHe added that `` sanction or threat of sanction does not help resolve the question of Syria '' but `` may further complicate the situation '' . \nThe Libyan conflict has sharpened divisions among Security Council members , with both Moscow and Beijing saying that the resolution authorising the use of force to protect civilians was misused by Nato to bring down Col Muammar Gaddafi 's regime . \nOur correspondent says Tuesday 's vote exposes the deep rift at the UN between the major powers , and the complete difference of approach in how to deal with Mr Assad 's government and its crackdown . \nAfter the vote , France 's UN Ambassador Gerard Araud said the veto showed `` disdain for the legitimate interests that have been fought for in Syria '' since the protests in the country began . \nBut he added that `` no veto can give give carte blanche to the Syrian parties who have lost full legitimacy in assassinating and killing their people '' . \nThere have been six months of protests in Syria and reports of some 2,700 deaths `` Calls from the Arab League for an end to this bloodbath and statements from neighbouring countries to the suffering of the Syrian people show that this veto goes against the sense of history underway in Syria and throughout the region , '' said Mr Araud . \nThe US envoy , Susan Rice , said : `` The United States is outraged that this council has utterly failed to address an urgent moral challenge and a growing threat to regional peace and security . \n`` Today the courageous people of Syria can now see who on this council supports their yearning for liberty and universal human rights and who does not , '' she said . \nSyria 's envoy to the UN , Bashar Jaafari , said his country was `` astounded '' by the council 's efforts to `` undermine stability , security and co-existence '' in the region and in Syria . \nMs Rice walked out in protest when Mr Bashar said the US was using its veto power to protect Israel , which could be seen as `` partaking in a genocide '' . \nWashington said earlier it hoped the council would send a strong message to Syria . \nGermany said the world had to show solidarity with Syrians on the streets . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}

'' \nThe latest violence comes less than two weeks after 108 people were killed in a massacre in Houla . \nHarrowing videos of dead children have been circulating on the internet purporting to show victims of the Qubair attack . \nAccording to clandestine activists , security forces bombarded Qubair , about 20km -LRB- 12 miles -RRB- north-west of Hama , late on Wednesday . \nQubair is a small farming settlement inside the Sunni Muslim village of Maarzaf , which lies close to Alawite villages . \nActivists blamed much of the killing on local pro-government Alawite militiamen known as shabiha . \nMilitiamen allegedly shot and stabbed many people , with some bodies reportedly set alight along with houses . \nThe Local Co-ordination Committees , a network of activists , said 78 people had died in Qubair , including 35 members of one family . \nThe BBC 's Tom Esselmont : `` The activists are comparing the killings to those in Houla '' Syria 's ambassador to the UN , Bashar Jaafari , denied Syrian government involvement in the killings and said the allegations were mere propaganda and not helping the situation . \nState TV reported that security forces had launched an attack on an `` armed terrorist stronghold '' in Qubair after appeals from citizens . \nIt said a UN observer team had entered Qubair and had `` witnessed a crime by the terrorists , who killed nine women and children '' . \nMembers of the international community in Damascus say that most victims at Houla were killed by gunfire raking rooms and not in execution-style killings , contrary to initial reports . \nAre you in Syria ? \nDo you have friends or family there ? \nSend us your comments and experiences using the form below . \nAt no time should you endanger yourself or others or take any unnecessary risks . \nSend your pictures and videos to yourpics@bbc.co.uk or text them to 61124 -LRB- UK -RRB- or +447624800100 -LRB- International -RRB- . \nIf you have a large file you can upload here . \nIf you are happy to be contacted by a BBC journalist please leave a telephone number that we can contact you on . \nIn some cases a selection of your comments will be published , displaying your name as you provide it and location , unless you state otherwise . \nYour contact details will never be published . \nWhen sending us pictures , video or eyewitness accounts at no time should you endanger yourself or others , take any unnecessary risks or infringe any laws . \nPlease ensure you have read the terms and conditions . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}

'' \nShashank Joshi Associate fellow , Royal United Services Institute So far , there is no sign that Houla will be a game-changer . \nFirst , remember that this massacre will be interpreted differently around the world . \nMany countries sympathise with the Assad 's government narrative that the opposition are Arab-backed Sunni fundamentalists and terrorists . \nJust as some critics argue that the massacres in Libya last year and Racak , Kosovo , in 1999 are exaggerated or fabricated , similar scepticism about Houla will persist , even in the face of incontrovertible evidence - and that will affect how the UN Security Council lines up on the issue . \nMoreover , the growing role of al-Qaeda and affiliated jihadist groups in Syria has , in recent months , become a further deterrent to intervention . \nAmerican officials are terrified that support for the opposition may end up in the hands of the very same people that mounted attacks on Western forces in Iraq just a few years ago . \nAbove all , however , no-one wants to pick a fight with Russia . \n`` Time is running out for the Assad regime to adopt the -LRB- Kofi Annan peace -RRB- plan , implement that plan and stop the torture , abuse and murder of their own people , '' he told the BBC . \nUS Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called it an `` appalling '' massacre , saying President Bashar al-Assad 's `` rule by murder and fear must come to an end '' . \nIn a statement on Saturday , Mrs Clinton called the deaths an `` atrocity '' and said Washington would increase pressure on `` Assad and his cronies '' to give up power . \nFrance 's Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said he was making immediate arrangements for a Paris meeting of the Friends of Syria group . \nThe group includes Western and Arab nations , but not Russia or China , which have blocked previous attempts to introduce UN sanctions . \nIn a joint statement , UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and UN-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan said the attack was a `` flagrant violation of international law '' . \nThey said the crime involved `` indiscriminate and disproportionate use of force '' and violated commitments by Syria 's government . \nIn April , Damascus pledged to implement a six-point plan brokered by Mr Annan , including a ceasefire and the withdrawal of heavy weaponry from urban areas . \nMr Annan is expected to visit Damascus on Monday to try to breathe life into the political process . \nBut the opposition Free Syrian Army -LRB- FSA -RRB- said it could no longer commit to the ceasefire unless the Security Council could ensure that civilians were protected . \nIn a statement , the FSA said that if urgent steps were not taken , then Mr Annan 's plan was `` going to hell '' . \nIt said killings in Syria were taking place `` under the eyes of the UN observers , '' and called on states to `` announce the failure of the Annan plan '' . \nViolence in Syria has continued despite the deployment of some 260 UN observers sent to oversee a ceasefire . \nThe head of the observer mission in Syria , Maj Gen Robert Mood , called the massacre a `` brutal tragedy '' , but did not say who carried out the murders . \nAfter a UN visit to the town on Saturday , he said they could confirm `` the use of small arms , machine gun , artillery and tanks '' . \n`` Whoever started , whoever responded and whoever carried out this deplorable act of violence should be held responsible , '' Gen Mood said . \nThe UN has confirmed the deaths of at least 90 people , but the opposition Syrian National Council , as well as rights groups , put the toll higher . \nActivists have complained that they called for help as the massacre was taking place . \nAbu Emad , speaking from Houla , said their appeals to UN monitors failed to produce action . \n`` We told them at night , we called seven of them . \nWe told them the massacre is being committed right now at Houla by the mercenaries of this regime and they just refused to come and stop the massacre , '' he said . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}
{"id": "18", "time": "2012-02-06", "text": "07 February 12 00:35 GMT As Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov heads to Syria for talks with President Bashar al-Assad , BBC Moscow correspondent Daniel Sandford assesses what he might hope to achieve from his visit . \nTuesday 's visit by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and the director of Russia 's Foreign Intelligence Service , Mikhail Fradkov , comes three days after the UN Security Council meeting in which Russia and China vetoed a resolution condemning the Syrian government 's violence against its citizens . \nSergei Lavrov has not revealed the details of the message he says he is taking to Damascus from his own head of state , Russian President Dmitry Medvedev . \nMr Lavrov said that those who `` hastily '' brought the resolution to a vote in the Security Council had ignored Russia 's request to wait until he had been to see President Assad . \nHe described comments by American and European leaders after the vote as `` indecent and hysterical . '' \nUS Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said : `` What happened -LRB- on Saturday -RRB- at the United Nations was a travesty ... Faced with a neutered Security Council , we have to redouble our efforts outside of the United Nations with those allies and partners who support the Syrian people 's right to have a better future . '' \nRussia has caused outrage in many Western and Arab countries by blocking attempts to use the United Nations to pressure President Assad to step aside . \nIf Assad 's government does eventually fall , Russia will lose its last remaining ally in the region , which makes its position look rather short-term . \nBut James Sherr , Senior Fellow of the Russia Eurasia program at the Royal Institute of International Affairs , explained that while the Russian position may seem strange to some , it is actually based on a quite simple logic . \n`` Russia is a country which derives a significant amount of its influence and image in the world from maintaining a very traditional strict dividing line between internal and international affairs , '' he said . \n`` This is a selling point , because Russia is able to say : `` Look we are not the United States , we are not the EU . \nWe are a reliable consistent partner '' . \nAnd in a world consisting still , overwhelmingly , of not terribly democratic states this is very important . \nAnd Russia ca n't just walk away from it . '' \nRussia has its last remaining naval base in the Mediterranean at the Syrian port of Tartus . \nRussia is also Syria 's main supplier of weapons . \n`` The base at Tartus is becoming a significant military base again , '' James Sherr said . \n`` And Syria is one of the few countries in the world to have had a consistent military relationship with both the Soviet Union and Russia . '' \nNonetheless there are signs that Sergei Lavrov and Mikhail Fradkov may use the meeting to encourage some sort of change in Syria . \nAs Sergei Lavrov explained to ABC Australia last week : `` We 're not a friend , we 're not an ally of President Assad . \nWe never said that President Assad remaining in power is the solution to the crisis . '' \nBut he also said : `` I do n't think Russian policy is about asking people to step down . \nRegime change is not our profession . \nIt is up to the Syrians themselves to decide how to run the country , how to introduce the reforms , what kind of reforms , without any outside interference . '' \nThat is where Western diplomats say a contradiction emerges in the Russian position . \nWhile it says that the people have a right to choose their leader , it does not allow for the international community to support a population trying to overthrow an unpopular government . \nThis means that , while Russia says it is trying to prevent an escalation of the conflict , some in the Syrian opposition claim that the Russian\\/Chinese veto is in fact driving them closer to all-out conflict . \nBut Sergei Lavrov said that the vetoed UN Security Council resolution had not put enough pressure on opposition groups and `` armed extremists '' to also withdraw their forces from areas of conflict . \n`` Such a resolution would have meant the Security Council was taking the side of one participant in a civil war , '' he said . \nHis meeting in Damascus is Russia 's chance to show that it has an alternative to end the spiralling violence in Syria . \n"}

'' \nAbd-al-Bari Atwan in London 's Arab nationalist Al-Quds Al-Arabi `` The double Russian-Chinese veto at the UN Security Council ... is an important turning point in international relations and the start of a new page in a Cold War of a different nature . '' \n`` Both the Syrian leadership and the Syrian people are aware that the parties attacking Syria have been left confused after the second double veto by Russia and China at the Security Council . \nThey are also aware that they will not find a way to continue their dirty tricks other than by escalating their media campaign through high-sounding rhetoric and false stories of fighting and defections in the Syrian army , which exist only in their sick minds . '' \nQasem Ghafuri in Iran 's Jaam-e Jam `` This veto shows that that the West 's attitude towards Syria is not to assist its people but to overthrow its government , which is completely contrary to the people 's wish . \nThe Arab League 's cooperation with America in this field has further revealed the face of this US pawn ... The veto also shows that Obama 's policy of improving ties with Russia and China has failed . '' \n`` Re-energising the Arab Initiative and the committee of Arab observers is the only way to stop the crisis from exploding and to resolve the crisis within the Arab arena ... We have to affirm an important truth , which is the failure of the military and security solutions in Syria just as they failed in Yemen , Libya , Tunisia and Egypt . \nThere is no real solution except a political solution and we hope that the regime takes this seriously . '' \nMazin Hamad in Qatar 's Al-Watan `` The Syrian crisis has entered a new phase of security and political escalation after Russia and China used their veto at the UN Security Council ... With the expectation of more bloodshed and resistance , civil war has unfortunately taken a step closer to reality . \nThe veto undermines the role of the UN and the international community at this stage , and it is becoming impossible to stop the killing machine in the Syrian city .

We must also understand that the interests of states change , and today 's veto may not last long . '' \nAndrei Yashlavsky in Moskovskiy Komsomolets Moscow daily `` Bashar al-Assad has turned into the proverbial ` suitcase without a handle ' - heavy to carry but a shame to give up . \nHence all the wavering in Russia 's position ... After all , Syria is one of the few strategic partners Russia has left in the region , and a not insignificant buyer of our arms . \nIn that respect Moscow 's logic is clear . \nYet it is equally clear that Assad 's prospects of a long and happy presidency are virtually nil , and then it will be extremely difficult to build relations with the new authorities . \nIt is not for nothing that the Americans have already openly stated that now the bloodshed in Syria will be on Russia 's and China 's hands . '' \nQu Xing of Foreign Ministry think-tank in Renmin Ribao `` The Syrian government should attach importance to the people 's aspirations for social change , and the current situation is unsustainable . \nThe Syrian opposition should understand that , if foreign countries intervene militarily , several generations in Syria will pay the price for it . \nThe Arab League and the Gulf Cooperation Council should understand that avoiding foreign armed intervention will be conducive to the overall interests of the Arab world . \nThe US and Europe should also understand that if an out-of-control situation in Syria causes the situation in the entire Middle East to go out of control , hits energy supplies and breeds extremist forces , this will benefit no one .

'' \nEarlier , Russia also defended its decision to veto the UN draft resolution , saying the proposal was unbalanced . \nThe double veto by Beijing and Moscow on Saturday drew an angry reaction from around the world . \nMrs Clinton said this was a unified international community seeking an end to the violence `` What happened ... at the United Nations was a travesty , '' US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said . \n`` Faced with a neutered Security Council , we have to redouble our efforts outside of the United Nations with those allies and partners who support the Syrian people 's right to have a better future , '' she added . \nAnalysts say Mrs Clinton appeared to be alluding to the formation of a grouping of nations similar to the Contact Group on Libya . \nThat group - a collection of Arab and other countries - oversaw international help for opponents of late Col Gaddafi . \nFrench Foreign Minister Alain Juppe called the Russian-Chinese veto a `` moral stain '' on the UN . \nHe said Europe would strengthen sanctions against Syria and eventually `` the regime will have to realize that it is completely isolated and can not continue '' . \nThe draft resolution - which had already been watered down in an apparent attempt to overcome Russian objections - was supported by 13 of the 15 members of the UN Security Council , when it was put to a vote . \nThe Syrian National Council , the biggest opposition group , said Russia and China were `` responsible for the escalating acts of killing '' , calling the veto `` an irresponsible step that is tantamount to a licence to kill with impunity '' . \nCoalition of seven opposition factions , united against Assad regime Includes Kurds , tribal leaders , Islamists , democracy activists Formed last November after months of talks in Turkey Stated aim is to support the revolution and overthrow Assad UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said the two countries were making a `` great mistake '' , accusing them of `` turning their backs on the Arab world '' . \nThe BBC 's Jim Muir in Beirut says the Russians do seem to be feeling the pressure . \nThey are sending their Foreign Minister , Sergei Lavrov , to talk to President Assad in Damascus on Tuesday . \nRussia would like to help mediate a political solution , but the opposition do not see the Russians as honest brokers , our correspondent says . \nAre you in Syria ? \nDo you have friends or family there ? \nSend us your comments and experiences using the form below Send your pictures and videos to yourpics@bbc.co.uk or text them to 61124 -LRB- UK -RRB- or +447624800100 -LRB- International -RRB- . \nIf you have a large file you can upload here . \nIf you are happy to be contacted by a BBC journalist please leave a telephone number that we can contact you on . \nIn some cases a selection of your comments will be published , displaying your name as you provide it and location , unless you state otherwise . \nYour contact details will never be published . \nWhen sending us pictures , video or eyewitness accounts at no time should you endanger yourself or others , take any unnecessary risks or infringe any laws . \nPlease ensure you have read the terms and conditions . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}
{"id": "127", "time": "2012-05-29", "text": "Syria crisis : Counting the victims By Jastinder Khera BBC News The number of those killed , the manner of their killing and the cause are all hugely disputed The movement of foreign media and independent human rights organizations has been severely curtailed within the country , making the verification of casualty figures almost impossible . \nRecently , the presence of UN monitors has provided another source of information - as with the massacre in the village of Taldou near Houla - but for the most part , the outside world has been reliant on casualty figures supplied by opposition activists . \nSyrian government sources and the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency Agency -LRB- Sana -RRB- have been issuing casualty figures for specific events , but official estimates of the overall death toll have been more sporadic . \nIn early April , Sana quoted a letter from the Syrian foreign ministry as saying 6,143 Syrians , including both soldiers and civilians , had died since the beginning of the crisis , placing the blame on `` armed terrorist groups '' . \nIn the same letter , the foreign ministry sharply criticised UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay for what it called `` bias '' in her comments on Syria . \nThe Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights -LRB- OHCHR -RRB- in Geneva had been providing some of the most widely quoted estimates of death toll earlier in the uprising . \nHowever , in December , the OHCHR stopped trying to produce estimates because verifying the toll had become too difficult . \nUp to that point , the OHCHR had been taking figures from `` five different organizations who were compiling lists , and then coming up with our own ... figures , tending towards the cautious end of the spectrum , '' according to Rupert Colville , spokesman for the OHCHR . \nIt is an approach that is also used by some activists ; sharing information in an effort to better corroborate it . \nTwo of the organizations that the OHCHR had used were the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights -LRB- SOHR -RRB- and the Violations Documentation Center -LRB- VDC -RRB- . \nThose behind these sites say they run verification on reports of casualties . \nAfter initial reports from activists and volunteers in the field , those at VDC say they try to add `` video clips , pictures of the martyrs , or any other details about the victim '' . \nThe data is periodically audited by sending it back to activists in the field for correction and addition of any missing information . \nHowever , VDC does admit that these steps `` do not present the possibility of a complete and full checking of the information '' . \nFurthermore , the methodologies of the different sites vary and the tolls they have arrived at differ greatly . \nFor example , as of 29 May , the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights had put the number of civilian dead at 9,183 , with 3,821 dead from the security forces . \nInitial casualty reports come from direct conversations with networks of activists , lists published by activists in Syria such as the Local Co-ordination Committees -LRB- in the case of VDC -RRB- , or tweets and email reports -LRB- in the case of Syria Tracker -RRB- Criteria for adding victims to the various lists differ , although most groups say they try to establish victims ' names , ages and location of death Verification procedures vary . \nSome try to reach the victim 's family , but many use photos and videos posted online for corroboration . \nThose at the VDC website say they periodically send data back to activists in the field for checking Some sites then collaborate with each other to cross-check lists of victims and information about them However , at the same time the VDC had a tally of 11,884 civilians killed and 2,159 casualties from the military and security forces . \nAnother opposition website referred to by some branches of the UN , Syria Shuhada -LRB- Syria Martyrs -RRB- , had an even higher number - 15,344 , of which it says 14,072 were civilians , the rest being defectors from the military . \nIt does not count deaths from regime forces . \nThe activists who run the Syria Shuhada website recognize that their estimates are consistently higher than those produced by other activists . \nOne reason they give for this is the wide range of sources that they gather their information from in the first instance . \nTheir figures are collated from other opposition websites and cross-checked , but they say that since becoming more well-known in Syria they have also received information directly from protesters ' `` committees '' . \nThe other reason for the higher figure is that they record deaths even when no name is given for the individual . \n`` Many of these have videos attached to them or are from sources we trust , '' the activists who run the website say . \n`` Other organizations do n't accept bodies with no names which seems ludicrous to us , '' they add . \nA UK-based activist who has been making his own efforts to compile casualty figures , Mahmoud Ali Hamad , says another issue is the large number of people who have been detained . \n`` If months have passed after someone being detained and they 're not heard of again and we do n't even know where they are - then they 're considered dead , '' he says . \nIt 's not fair to expect people in that situation to be unbiased '' End Quote Mahmoud Ali Hamad Activist `` Even before the start of the uprising , this is deep down in people 's consciousness in Syria , '' he adds . \nEven though many websites document victims ' manner of death , or keep separate lists of the detained , he suggests that this may be causing some discrepancy in the figures produced by different groups , if some are including the numbers of missing in their death tolls . \nThose trying to stay in touch with activists in Syria say the upsurge in violence this year has complicated the issue further as many of those who were reporting deaths to the outside world have been killed or displaced themselves . \n`` Lots of my contacts in Homs have died , and many people have left , '' Mr Ali Hamad says . \n`` It 's a chaotic situation . '' \nActivists in the US who set up the Syria Tracker website say that `` with the escalation of violence starting in February 2012 , some groups have needed to change their methodologies ... and relax some of the controls they are placing '' on recording deaths . \nMany of those in Homs trying to report casualty figures have themselves been killed , activists say And what of the danger of exaggeration of the data to garner sympathy for the opposition ? \n`` It 's not fair to expect people in that situation to be unbiased , '' Mr Ali Hamad says . \n`` This regime is their ultimate enemy . '' \n`` So even when I 'm talking to people who I went to school with , I am taking into account that they are traumatised people . \nI do n't take their word for everything .

{"id": "214", "time": "2011-08-30", "text": "30 August 11 11:00 GMT Associate fellow , Royal United Services Institute I argued in May that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad would probably survive , but new pressures , from within and without , are taking the country one step closer to the tipping point . \nThe initial judgement hinged on three factors : the regime 's loyal and powerful army ; the limited spread of protests ; and outside powers ' uncertainty in confronting the regime - out of fear for some , and interest for others . \nThe army is loyal because it is dominated by Alawi officers belonging to the same syncretic sect of Islam as the ruling dynasty . \nTE Lawrence - the British World War I officer dubbed Lawrence of Arabia - wrote of the Alawi that `` the sect , vital in itself , was clannish in feeling and politics . \nOne ... would not betray another '' . \nOrientalist musings aside , Syria 's army will not lightly dump Mr Assad . \nUnlike Hosni Mubarak in Egypt , civil and military fates are more closely bound together . \nSyria 's military might is also greater - four times the size of the Libyan army , protected by 100 more active surface-to-air missile sites , and materially helped by Iran . \nElite divisions of the army crushed protests sequentially , moving from one city to the other with gruesome efficiency . \nThe good , the bad and the confused Syria 's two largest cities , Damascus and Aleppo , remained quiet , allowing forces to concentrate their firepower where it was needed . \nIt helped that large parts of the population did not join the protests , either out of a direct stake in the regime - Sunni business elites , for instance - or simply out of fear of Lebanon-style civil war resulting from Syria 's kaleidoscopic ethnic and sectarian diversity . \nThat fear also paralysed the international community . \nSyria 's foes -LRB- Israel -RRB- , friends -LRB- Iran -RRB- and the confused -LRB- Turkey -RRB- saw nothing good coming from Syria 's implosion . \nOthers - like the US - had pulled most coercive levers over the past years , resulting in a sort of sanctions liquidity trap . \nThat is why Mr Assad had every chance of repeating the trick his father pulled in 1982 when , in an audacious bit of counterrevolution , he simply levelled the rebellious city of Hama and murdered up to 40,000 citizens . \nThe Syrian revolution of 2011 could also have been one more of those many abortive uprisings whose blood flecks the history of the modern Middle East , yet could not change its course . \nThings are no longer so clear . \nThe outside world is slowly getting its act together . \nThe US finally issued its `` magic democracy words '' -LRB- a term coined by US Middle East scholar Marc Lynch -RRB- and called for President Assad to go . \nNo-one expects that the words will wound themselves , but they tie American hands and thereby force the machinery of US foreign policy to churn out fresh ways of hounding Damascus . \nThey also send a powerful signal - not to Mr Assad , but to US allies and partners who now know that there may be a cost to hedging their bets . \nFor example , their firms may be caught up in sanctions , as has occurred in the course of US policy towards Iran . \nTurkey has grown frustrated with refugee flows , and is facing domestic pressure to act on the massacre of co-religionists . \nIt is treading carefully to avoid wrecking hard-won ties , but can not hold out for long . \nSaudi Arabia , a state not known for its squeamishness about crushing dissent through force , withdrew its ambassador . \nLast week , the world 's largest oil companies and traders quietly decided to stop dealing with the regime in anticipation of EU sanctions - oil exports are a third of the Syrian budget , and almost all go to Europe . \nThis makes it likelier that the largely Sunni trading classes of Damascus and Aleppo , pillars of the regime , desert with their financial and political capital once the cost of the status quo begins to bite . \nThe fall of Tripoli is important in this regard . \nOnly now have protests in the suburbs of Damascus begun to seep into the heart of the capital , forcing more checkpoints and helicopter patrols . \nThat has not happened in Aleppo . \nIf it does , then that still leaves just one piece of the revolutionary jigsaw left to fall in place : the army . \nThere has been a trickle of defections in the eastern tribal area of Deir al-Zour adjacent to Iraq , in the north-western province of Idlib , and in towns around Damascus and Homs . \nBut core units - more powerful than Gaddafi 's own special brigades - will not melt away or agree to a democratic transition . \nThe army might hold together , shed Mr Assad , and reconstitute itself around new elites - emergency surgery to save the regime , of the sort that the Egyptian generals tried and failed to perform . \nOr key loyalists could peel away to set in motion a civil war , fought against parts of the uprising fortified with departing army units . \nTurkey , Iraq , Lebanon and Israel would be the first to experience the fallout , with others not far behind . \nNeither looks an appealing outcome , but it is increasingly hard to see how Syria can now travel down any other roads . \nShashank Joshi is an Associate Fellow at the Royal United Services Institute -LRB- RUSI -RRB- , a defense think tank , and a doctoral student of international relations at Harvard University . \nSyria profile -LRB- 28 Aug 11 | Middle East -RRB- \n"}

'' \n`` The kingdom of Saudi Arabia ... demands an end to the killing-machine and bloodshed and calls for acts of wisdom before it is too late . '' \n`` Syria should think wisely before it is too late and issue and enact reforms that are not merely promises but actual reforms , '' he concluded . \nBBC Middle East correspondent Jon Leyne says the statement seems to be a co-ordinated move , following the Arab League 's own communique . \nThe 22-member league said it was `` alarmed '' by the situation in the country and called for an immediate end to the violence . \nThe six-nation Gulf Co-operation Council -LRB- GCC -RRB- also issued its first comments about the unrest on Saturday , condemning the `` excessive use of force '' and calling for an `` immediate end to the violence '' . \nKing Abdullah sent Saudi troops in March to Bahrain as part of a GCC force to help the country 's Sunni monarchy crush anti-government protests led by the Shia majority . \nSaudi officials also criticised the decision to put Egypt 's ousted president , Hosni Mubarak , on trial . \nOur correspondent says President Assad is now even more isolated . \nA US state department official said the Saudi monarch 's statement was `` another clear sign that the international community , including Syria 's neighbors , are repulsed by the brutal actions of the Syrian government '' . \nDiplomatic tension with neighbouring Turkey is also rising . \nPrime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Saturday that Ankara had `` run out of patience '' with President Assad 's regime and that it could no longer `` remain a spectator '' to events across its border . \nHe announced that he was sending Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu to Damascus on Tuesday to deliver a `` tough message '' . \nBut one of Mr Assad 's top advisers said he would be given an even tougher message to take home . \nUN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon spoke to President Assad by telephone on Saturday , urging him to stop the use of military force against protesters and to allow humanitarian missions into his country . \nLast week the UN Security Council also called on the Syrian leader to stop the violence . \nPresident Assad has insisted that his government is enacting reforms . \nHe blames the violence on `` armed terrorist gangs '' which he says are backed by foreign powers . \n`` Syria is on the path to reform , '' he was quoted as telling Lebanese Foreign Minister Adnan Mansour by the state news agency , Sana . \n`` To deal with outlaws who cut off roads , seal towns and terrorise residents is a duty of the state , which must defend security and protect the lives of civilians , '' he added . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}

'' \nIn another move today , Sheikh Ahmed al-Tayeb - the Grand Imam of al-Azhar , the leading authority in Sunni Islam - called for an end to what he called the `` Arab and Islamic tragedy '' in Syria . \nIt all appears to add up to more isolation for President Assad and the regime within the region , with the open criticism from Saudi Arabia on the personal authority of the king seen as the most significant . \nWe must not watch in silence while hundreds are killed and thousands more detained and tortured '' End Quote William Hague British foreign secretary Riyadh certainly has an interest in seeking to weaken Syria 's ties with Iran , but diplomats believe this is by no means its only calculation in making a move that contrasts with its usually more discreet regional diplomacy . \nThe British foreign secretary , William Hague , said in a statement issued on Monday evening that he condemned the violence against Syrian citizens in Hama , Deir al-Zour and other cities `` that shows no signs of ending '' . \nHe added : `` We must not watch in silence while hundreds are killed and thousands more detained and tortured . \nI therefore welcome the strong condemnation by countries across the Arab world and Turkey of the regime 's actions and am urgently working with partners on increasing the pressure further on President Assad and those around him .

{"id": "262", "time": "2012-03-01", "text": "Syria crisis : Opposition sets up military bureau The BBC 's Jim Muir says footage from Wednesday shows tanks and soldiers on the edge of Baba Amr Syria 's main political opposition group has formed a military bureau to unify armed resistance to the government . \nThe Syrian National Council -LRB- SNC -RRB- said the bureau would bring armed groups under a central command and control the flow of weapons to avoid `` chaos '' . \nThe government launched a ground assault in the city of Homs this week after weeks of shelling . \nThe UN 's rights council has passed a resolution condemning `` systematic violations '' against civilians . \nThe motion , supported by 37 nations , called for the regime to allow access for aid agencies , and demanded an immediate halt to the violence . \nChina and Russia , which have both vetoed UN resolutions on Syria , voted against the proposal . \nCuba also rejected the motion . \nThe vote carries no legal weight , but analysts say it may embolden diplomats to take a tougher line in UN Security Council debates . \nSNC leader Burhan Ghalioun announced the new military bureau at a news conference in Paris . \nHe said the uprising had begun as a non-violent movement , but the council had to `` shoulder its responsibilities in light of this new reality '' . \nMr Ghalioun said the bureau would function like a defense ministry and be staffed by soldiers from the main armed group , the Free Syrian Army -LRB- FSA -RRB- , as well as civilians . \nIt would control the supply of arms , track and organise armed groups , manage funding and seek guidance from foreign experts , he said , insisting its function was only to protect peaceful protesters . \nMr Ghalioun said the FSA had agreed to the new organization . \nHowever , the head of the FSA , Col Riyad al-Assad , has declared his organization will not co-operate with the new bureau , says the BBC 's Jim Muir , in neighbouring Lebanon . \nIt is extraordinary , our correspondent explains , because the announcement specifically mentioned that the bureau was being established in order to provide arms to the FSA , as well as political control . \nWhat Col Assad is saying is that the FSA does not want any political interference and has its own military strategy , which is to keep fighting the government , our correspondent says . \nForeign ministers of the six Gulf Arab states have said they will meet Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov next week to `` express disappointment with the Russian stance '' , according to the AFP news agency UN-Arab League peace envoy Kofi Annan has called for unity behind a single mediation effort Britain has confirmed it is withdrawing its remaining diplomatic staff from Damascus because of security concerns Syria has responded to criticism that it refused to allow UN rights official Valerie Amos into the country , saying she had requested `` an unsuitable time '' , and promising to continue consultations . \nThe Baba Amr district , where many opposition fighters are believed to be sheltering , has been under bombardment for almost a month . \nKofi Annan : `` It is when the international community speaks with one voice that its voice is powerful '' Many of the area 's estimated 100,000 residents have fled to escape the siege , and it is unclear how many are still trapped . \nGround troops moved into the besieged quarter earlier this week , and state TV broadcast footage of smashed and empty streets with the sound of gunfire reverberating . \nCommunication with the area has been largely cut off , and people are struggling to get in or out . \nGovernment officials claimed to have taken control of Baba Amr late on Wednesday , and said troops were now `` mopping up '' pockets of resistance . \nBut opposition activists strongly denied those claims , saying fighters from the Free Syrian Army had managed to push back regime forces . \n`` They 've been trying to enter the neighborhood of Baba Amr but the Free Syrian Army is fighting back , '' one activist said . \n`` It 's just miserable here in Baba Amr . '' \nWitnesses in Homs said the city had been blanketed in snow , which has slowed the military assault . \nBut the cold weather is making life difficult for residents , many of whom are without power and running low on basic supplies . \nOne resident told the BBC how people were trying to melt snow because they had no water . \nSeveral Western journalists trapped in the latest bombardment in Homs have managed to escape to neighbouring Lebanon in recent days . \nBut two French journalists , Edith Bouvier , who is seriously wounded , and William Daniels , remain unaccounted for . \nActivists say more than 7,500 people have died since the uprising against Mr Assad 's government began last March . \nThe government , however , says at least 1,345 members of the security forces have been killed combating `` armed gangs and terrorists '' , and puts the number of civilians killed at 2,493 . \nAre you in Syria ? \nDo you have friends or family in the country ? \nSend us your comments and experiences using the form below . \nSend your pictures and videos to yourpics@bbc.co.uk or text them to 61124 -LRB- UK -RRB- or +447624800100 -LRB- International -RRB- . \nIf you have a large file you can upload here . \nIf you are happy to be contacted by a BBC journalist please leave a telephone number that we can contact you on . \nIn some cases a selection of your comments will be published , displaying your name as you provide it and location , unless you state otherwise . \nYour contact details will never be published . \nWhen sending us pictures , video or eyewitness accounts at no time should you endanger yourself or others , take any unnecessary risks or infringe any laws . \nPlease ensure you have read the terms and conditions . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}
{"id": "85", "time": "2012-04-16", "text": "Tough though it has been , getting agreement on the ceasefire in Syria is the easy bit compared with what comes next . \nThe truce itself has been shaky , and has more or less completely collapsed in some areas , especially those , mainly Sunni , quarters of Homs such as Khaldieh where rebel fighters are still entrenched and where hostilities and bombardment have reached close to pre-truce levels . \nJust shoring up the ceasefire and preventing a major eruption of fighting across the board will in itself be a huge challenge . \nEven before the advance party of UN monitors began arriving on Sunday night , there were ominous signs . \nThe government - through an `` authorised military source '' - said that `` terrorist armed groups '' had escalated the violence in a `` hysterical '' manner as soon as the Security Council passed its resolution on Saturday authorising the deployment of the first 30 truce observers . \nIt said the security forces would take action to prevent further `` criminal attacks '' by the `` terrorist groups '' - in other words , the ceasefire could effectively be discarded wherever the authorities deemed fit . \nOpposition groups , including the Local Co-ordination Committees and the Muslim Brotherhood , called for a strict timetable for implementation of all six clauses of Kofi Annan 's peace plan , and warned that the opposition could not remain committed indefinitely to `` an empty truce '' if the regime continued violations and the wider process was not implemented . \nSo , with many violations reported by both sides in many places apart from Homs , it is clear that the truce could collapse completely unless reinforced by implementation of the six-point Annan plan and the deployment of observers , whose presence , the UN hopes , may help deter or inhibit acts of violence . \nAt this point , the key question could be : in whose interest is a ceasefire that holds on the basis of implementing all points of the Annan plan ? \nSyrian-led political process to address the aspirations and concerns of the Syrian people 2 . \nUN-supervised cessation of armed violence in all its forms by all parties to protect civilians 3 . \nAll parties to ensure provision of humanitarian assistance to all areas affected by the fighting , and implement a daily two-hour humanitarian pause 4 . \nAuthorities to intensify the pace and scale of release of arbitrarily detained persons 5 . \nAuthorities to ensure freedom of movement throughout the country for journalists 6 . \nAuthorities to respect freedom of association and the right to demonstrate peacefully The objective answer is that it is not to the regime 's advantage - indeed , it could prove fatal . \nBut it would benefit the opposition , or at least those elements of it who want a peaceful settlement short of the violent overthrow of the regime , which is far from being a realistic possibility at present . \nOne of the key provisions of the plan is the return to barracks of the armed forces , with their tanks and heavy weaponry - a withdrawal that was supposed to be completed by last Tuesday as the first step in the ceasefire process , before even the truce itself came into effect . \nIt has n't happened , and for good reason . \nThe regime is only maintaining its grip in many areas by military force . \nIf that iron fist is relaxed , it risks losing control of a large proportion of the country , whether to armed rebel groups whose movements are hard to prevent , or simply to a defiant and dissenting populace in the many places where hearts and minds have long been lost . \nThat could create a momentum which might carry through to the two big urban centres that have not yet been fully caught up in the revolt but where trouble has been on the rise , Damascus and Aleppo , with potentially fatal consequences for the regime . \nThat is why the government , having initially accepted the Annan plan , suddenly baulked and came up with a new raft of conditions and demands , including that the rebels must agree to disarm , that the opposition must give written guarantees of compliance , and that outside states such as Saudi Arabia , Qatar and Turkey must also give formal pledges to stop backing the rebels . \nUN Security Council resolution 2042 approves a team of up to 30 unarmed observers An initial group of six monitors arrives in Syria The rest of the advance team is set to follow later Once certain conditions are met , the UN will seek Security Council approval for an expanded force of about 250 observers Ban Ki-moon will set out concrete proposals by 18 April for this larger UN observer force In other words , a complete capitulation by the opposition , which would then enter any settlement talks in an extremely weak position , with the regime more or less free to dictate terms . \nBy contrast , a ceasefire in situ - as is theoretically in force right now - leaves rebel fighters in control in some parts of Homs and of Idlib province . \nDespite the ferocity of the crackdown unleashed in late January , the regime has not been able fully to restore its control over all areas by force . \nIf the Annan plan is implemented in full , regime dominance of the balance of power would be redressed even more towards some kind of equilibrium with the opposition , so that talks would take place on some kind of level playing-field . \nThere is much evidence that Russia is playing an absolutely crucial role in bringing about what regime compliance there has been so far . \nMoscow was instrumental in persuading Syria to accept the Annan plan in the first place , and then to drop the 11th-hour conditions it suddenly came up with . \nThat shows clearly that , while it can resist Western pressures and sanctions indefinitely , Damascus has no option but to bend when the Russians - with China tagging along - insist something must be done . \nWhat is equally clear is that more pressure from Moscow will be needed if all clauses of the Annan plan are to be implemented , especially the withdrawal of troops , tanks and heavy weapons . \nThe Russian role will clearly be equally crucial when , and if , it comes to dialogue between the regime and its opponents . \nIn many ways , Moscow will be the arbiter . \nThe alternative is stark : a return to the battlefield , with the regime trying to complete its control by force , and the opposition and its outside backers stepping up the arming and financing of rebel fighters , plunging the country into deep and prolonged chaos and a potential fragmentation that would have regional consequences . \nThat would not be in the interest of Russia or the regime 's other outside allies , such as the Chinese and indeed Iran . \nThey would risk losing their key Arab ally to an abrupt regime change pushed by regional and international rivals such as Saudi Arabia and the West . \nSo Russia is strongly motivated , and uniquely placed , to help act as midwife to political transition in Syria . \nUN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon : `` The whole world is watching with sceptical eyes '' What exactly Moscow has in mind as an endgame is not clear but will obviously be important . \nIt could be something akin to the transition from the Soviet Union to the Russia of today . \nOr perhaps Moscow sees it as a question of holding the ring while the Syrians themselves hammer out some kind of formula that would accommodate both the opposition and those still substantial sections of Syrian society that may still see the regime as a better alternative than sectarian chaos . \nWhat is clear is that Russia does not buy into the idea that President Bashar al-Assad and his inner circle can simply crush dissent by force and implement `` democratic reforms '' that remain cosmetic and leave the core of the regime intact . \nWork also needs to be done on the other side of the equation . \nIf a settlement is to have a chance , the opposition and its outside backers must be induced to give up their demand that Mr Assad must stand down as the first step in a transition process , and they must agree to talk to the regime . \nIn that sense , the Annan plan provided a face-saving way out for the Americans and others who had adopted the regime-change demand without having the means to bring it about swiftly or cleanly . \nIt also means that regional powers like Saudi Arabia and Qatar , who are engaged in a regime-to-regime vendetta with Damascus , would have to shelve their own ambitions , at least for the moment . \nA successful peaceful resolution in Syria will depend strongly on a continuation and strengthening of the international consensus and collaboration that allowed the Security Council finally to pass its first resolution on the Syria crisis on Saturday , covering the initial deployment of 30 observers . \nBut negotiations on the country 's future remain a distant prospect as the smoke of war continues to hang over Homs and other places . \nThe situation on the ground clearly must first be stabilised , at least relatively . \nA daily struggle can be expected over consolidating the ceasefire and implementing the Annan plan 's provisions . \nNothing will come easy . \nThe process involves a regime that is fighting for its survival and has shown it will stop at nothing to stay in power . \nSo the chances are that pressure will have to be applied every step of the way . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}

{"id": "168", "time": "2011-06-22", "text": "In the days after the alleged massacre of soldiers Jisr al-Shughour became a ghost town The Syrian government claims that armed outlaws carried out a `` heinous massacre '' in which 120 soldiers were killed at Jisr al-Shughour between 3 and 6 June . \nOpposition activists say it was one part of the army firing on another for refusing to kill protesters . \nThe BBC 's Gabriel Gatehouse has been investigating the now notorious incident at Jisr al-Shughour . \nAt the beginning of the month , the Syrian government said `` armed gangs '' had killed 120 of its soldiers in the town , which is near the Turkish border . \nThe opposition quickly came back with a rebuttal . \nThe demonstrators did n't deny the soldiers had been killed . \nBut they had been killed by the Syrian regime - shot , they claimed , for refusing to fire on unarmed protesters . \nIt is almost impossible to verify reports of the incident independently . \nBut amid the claims and counter-claims , a thread is beginning to emerge . \nOn 3 June , after Friday prayers , protesters gathered in Jisr al-Shughour to demonstrate against the Syrian government . \nAt least one man was killed . \nActivists say Baseel al-Masri was shot by government security forces . \nHis killing appears to have triggered a series of events that left more than 100 Syrian soldiers dead and caused thousands of civilians to flee their homes across the border into Turkey . \nMasri was buried the following day . \nMohammed Fazo , an activist using a pseudonym , told the BBC around 15,000 people attended the funeral procession . \nHe said he personally witnessed what happened next The Syrian government has been taking press and diplomats to alleged mass graves in the area `` During the funeral , snipers on the roof of the post office building fired at the protesters , '' he said . \nThis is apparently corroborated by another eyewitness , by the name of Abu Abdulla . \n`` There was indiscriminate shooting at the protesters , '' he told the BBC by phone . \n`` No-one can appreciate how bad it was unless they were there . \nThe shooting was so intensive as if they were firing at a herd of sheep . \nActually , they might have had more mercy on the sheep . '' \nSo what had started as a funeral quickly turned into another demonstration , which centred on the post office in the town 's central square . \nThe witnesses said angry protesters surrounded the building , chanting anti-regime slogans . \nThere , the demonstrators came under fire again , this time from inside the Post Office building . \nSo far , most accounts agree . \nBut what happened next is disputed . \nThe government says armed gangs stormed public buildings in the town , killing soldiers , civilians and security forces indiscriminately . \nBut other eyewitnesses say that the security forces , trapped inside their building and surrounded by an angry mob , called in support from the regular army . \nThousands of refugees fled Jisr al-Shughour for neighbouring Turkey Mohammed Fazo says that when the soldiers arrived , many refused to open fire when they realized the protesters were unarmed . \n`` When the army did not fire at us , the security services fired at the army personnel who refused to shoot at us . \nAnd then the army responded by firing at the security personnel who were firing on their own colleagues and shot them dead . '' \nNo-one we spoke to could tell us exactly how the standoff had ended . \nBut by Monday , most agreed , the State Security forces had been comprehensively routed and Jisr al-Shughour had become a ghost town . \nOut of the fog and confusion of the differing accounts , one man emerged as a hero for the protesters . \nA number of days after the battle in Jisr al-Shughour , a video was posted on YouTube . \nIt shows a slim , middle-aged man in military fatigues . \nHis name , he says , is Lt Col Hussein Harmoush . \nStaring directly into the camera , he reads from what is clearly a prepared statement . \nCol Harmoush 's desertion has become part of the mystery surrounding events at Jisr al-Shughour `` I declare my split from the army , '' he says , as he holds up what appears to be a military ID card for inspection . \nA reporter for Time Magazine tracked the colonel down in a village near the Turkish border . \nAccording to the article , Lt Col Harmoush said he and his men had been sent to Jisr al-Shughour to restore order . \nWhen the army began shelling the town , he said , he decided to defect . \nHe claimed to have taken 30 of his men with him . \nBut when the BBC finally tracked the colonel down on the phone , he told a story that was rather different from the myth that was already writing itself into the history books His defection , he said , had actually taken place four days after the killings in Jisr al-Shughour , on 9 June . \nFurthermore , he said he had defected on his own , and only joined up with a number of other defectors in the town later . \n`` I was not there at that time . \nI arrived there on 9 June , and when I arrived , there was absolutely no Syrian army there . \nFurthermore , he said , none of the other defectors he joined had been present at the time of the alleged massacre . \nHe admitted he had invented much of his initial story purely to keep the Syrian army at bay . \nBut , if it was n't Col Harmoush who led the fight against the security forces in the post office that crucial weekend , then who was it ? \nJisr al-Shughour has a history of rebellion . \nIn 1980 , a proportion of the town 's citizens rose up against president Hafez al-Assad , the current president 's father . \nThey paid a heavy price . \nTroops were sent in , sweeping through the town , seeking out and killing those they thought were responsible . \nThe Syrian government 's position is that their soldiers are going into towns and villages throughout the country to protect the local population and at their request . \nThe protesters for their part are adamant that they are all unarmed , and their demonstrations are peaceful . \nSo the idea that armed civilians could be attacking Syrian security forces is something neither side wishes to contemplate , in public at least . \nBut one protest leader we spoke to did admit that , in the case of Jisr al-Shughour , the local population may have had not only the motive but also the means to take up arms . \n`` We know that in bordering cities , there are weapons , '' said Amer al - Sadeq , an activist speaking from Damascus . \n`` If I have a pistol by my side and somebody is trying to come into my house to kill me , rape my daughters and kidnap them , I will never , ever hesitate to use that weapon to defend my house and to defend my household . \nSo I believe in that context , these events have happened in terms of self-defence .

'' \nThe authorities knew they could not keep the refugees trapped in schools without running into serious trouble with their Iraqi relatives . \nOn the same day of the march , a high-profile delegation from Baghdad arrived to sort out the problem . \nIt included the prime minister 's security adviser and the finance minister , who is himself from Anbar . \nA compromise was hammered out , under which refugees would be able to leave the schools provided they had relatives who could `` sponsor '' them , and provide written guarantees to the government . \nThe mechanisms to implement the agreement are still being debated by local authorities and the central government , but the incident highlights a wider divergence over the Syrian crisis . \nAs the Iraqi government watches with growing unease the gains made by the rebels in Syria , many in Iraq can not wait for a final blow to President Bashar al-Assad 's regime to be delivered . \nEveryone here knows the end of Mr Assad 's rule in Damascus could bring many barriers crashing down , including the border line cutting the Syrian desert into two . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}

afraid and angry . \nThe UN monitors have come to Syria to verify a ceasefire . \nBut the reality on the ground is that although government forces have withdrawn from many areas , attacks are ongoing . \nAnd without a real truce it is difficult to see how any kind of political process can begin . \nGovernment forces also continued to pound rebel-held districts of Homs , with the Syrian Observatory saying that mortar shells were landing at a rate of one a minute in Khaldiya and Bayada on Tuesday morning . \nHoms has been under almost continuous attack since the ceasefire began and some activists are warning there may not be much left to see if the UN observers do not come soon , reports the BBC 's Jim Muir in Beirut . \nThe military , tanks and heavy weapons were all supposed to have been withdrawn a week ago under Mr Annan 's peace plan . \nThe opposition Syrian National Council -LRB- SNC -RRB- accused the government of `` flagrant violations of the ceasefire '' and called on the UN observers to `` travel to Idlib and Homs immediately to see first-hand the massacres '' . \nBut the government said that `` armed terrorist groups '' had escalated their attacks leaving the authorities with no choice but to respond . \nFrench Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said any ceasefire violation should be met with a swift and firm response by the UN Security Council . \nAddressing an international conference on Syria in Paris , Mr Juppe also said that Western sanctions on the country were having an effect and that its foreign currency reserves had been halved . \nSyria 's foreign reserves were estimated at $ 17bn -LRB- # 10.7 bn -RRB- before the uprising began last year . \nOil production has also been reduced by 30 % , costing the government about $ 520m a month in revenue , according to French diplomats . \nUN Security Council resolution 2042 permits a team of up to 30 unarmed observers An initial group of six monitors has arrived in Syria The rest of the advance team is set to follow later Once certain conditions are met , the UN will seek Security Council approval for an expanded force of about 250 observers Secretary General Ban Ki-moon will set out concrete proposals by 18 April for this larger UN observer force Mr Juppe said the Syrian government was actively trying to evade the sanctions , and called for a solid international response to such `` maneuvers '' . \nBut Russia , which was instrumental in persuading the Syrian government to accept the Annan plan and the ceasefire , seems to be backing the government line in blaming the rebels , our correspondent says . \n`` There are outside forces that are not interested in the success of the current UN Security Council effort , '' Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said . \n`` They are doing their best to influence the Syrian opposition not to co-operate with the government in maintaining the ceasefire and setting up a future dialogue , '' he added . \nThe Arab League is meanwhile holding a ministerial meeting in Qatar , which Mr Annan is expected to attend to seek support for his plan . \nHowever , the emir of Qatar , which has openly advocated arming the opposition , has given the initiative just a 3 % chance of success . \n`` Earlier , we called for Arab military intervention to find a way out of the Syrian crisis , and spare the Syrian people further bloodshed . \nThe appeals for help from a people oppressed and killed every day are met only with silence , '' Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani said on Monday . \nThe UN says about 9,000 people have died since pro-democracy protests began in March 2011 . \nIn February , the Syrian government put the death toll at 3,838 -

\nRights groups said 11 people had been killed on Tuesday . \nSyria 's Foreign Minister Walid Muallem , in Russia for talks , said Damascus had taken steps to adhere to the plan by withdrawing some troops . \nHe blamed `` armed gangs '' for the continuing violence . \nUnder the peace plan - negotiated by the UN and Arab League 's special envoy on the Syrian crisis , Kofi Annan - Syrian troops were to have completed their withdrawal from population centres and stopped the use of heavy weaponry by Tuesday , ahead of a full ceasefire coming into place on Thursday . \nDamascus had agreed to the deadline , but on Sunday demanded written guarantees first that its opponents would give up arms , along with a promise from foreign states not to fund them . \nJim Muir BBC News , Beirut Mr Muallem 's suggestion that a ceasefire should coincide with the arrival of international peace monitors is getting things completely out of the sequence envisaged by Kofi Annan . \nThat called for the government to take the first step in pulling back its forces , and the opposition would follow suit in applying a ceasefire by Thursday morning . \nThe observers would then come in to monitor an existing peace , not be part of the stabilisation process in terms of going into a combat situation and trying to calm it themselves . \nIt indicates to me there is no clear way forward coming out of the meetings , unless there are things that have been decided behind the scenes . \nEverybody recognizes the Annan peace plan went as far as anybody could go in providing a balanced , peaceful political solution . \nIf this does n't work its very hard to see how any other plan could . \nSpeaking after talks with his Russian counterpart , Mr Muallem said army units had been withdrawn from some areas , a number of detainees released and agreement reached on getting humanitarian aid to those in need . \nBut he said that `` despite all these positive measures we noticed on a daily basis the escalation of opposition by the armed terrorist gangs '' . \nMr Muallem told the BBC Syria would only stop killing civilians `` when these groups stop killing '' . \nHe said a ceasefire could only come into force once a team of international observers had arrived , but also accused Turkey of supplying militant groups with weapons and allowing them to cross its borders , AFP reports . \nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the Syrian government `` could have been more active and decisive '' in implementing the plan , but that Mr Muallem had assured him Damascus was committed to it .

near the border with Turkey - and is threatening to spread eastwards towards its border with Iraq . \nAs anti-regime demonstrations continued in many parts of the country , the government on Wednesday mobilised its own demonstration of popular support as thousands of people turned out in a Damascus suburb to wave a giant Syrian flag 2.4 km -LRB- 1.4 miles -RRB- long . \nUN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay has repeatedly appealed to Syria to let in a humanitarian team make a proper assessment , but the Syrian authorities have refused . \nJim Muir BBC News , Beirut The people of Maarat al-Numan fear they may be next for the attention of the Syrian army 's troops and tanks , which have been gathering on the town 's outskirts for the past few days . \nAccording to residents and activists , many of the town 's 100,000-strong population have been fleeing in all directions . \nOfficials say they 're planning a `` limited military operation '' to restore security there . \nContinued anti-regime demonstrations are reported in many areas , including at Deir al-Zour in the east , Latakia on the coast , Homs and Hama in central Syria , and some suburbs of Damascus . \nBut in a big show of organised support for the regime , many thousands of people turned out to witness what 's being billed as the world 's biggest Syrian flag , running along a big stretch of main road on the western outskirts of the capital . \nThey waved pictures of President Assad and chanted slogans praising him . \nState TV said the event was organised to show the Syrian people 's cohesion , and rejection of foreign interference . \nBut despite being denied access by the Syrian government , the new UN report documents reliable evidence of widespread violations , says the BBC 's Imogen Foulkes in Geneva . \n`` The most egregious reports concern the use of live ammunition against unarmed civilians , including from snipers positioned on rooftops of public buildings and the deployment of tanks in areas densely populated by civilians , '' says the report . \nIt cites `` the excessive use of force in quelling demonstrators , arbitrary detentions , summary executions , torture '' . \nThe authorities appear to have denied civilians the right to food and medical care by laying siege to towns and preventing supply deliveries , it adds . \nThe preliminary report was commissioned by the UN human rights council in April , adds our correspondent . \nA more definitive account will have to wait until the Syrian government allows UN investigators in to see the situation for themselves . \nMeanwhile , Syria has called on the people of Jisr al-Shughour to return , three days after an army attack restored government control there . \nMore than 8,000 Syrians have fled from the north-western town into Turkey in the past week to escape military operations , which the government says are aimed at tackling `` terrorist organizations '' . \nSupporters of President Assad have unfurled a 2,000 ft flag in Damascus Officials said the city of around 100,000 people - which has been the focus of large anti-regime demonstrations - was returning to normal , but that army units were still pursuing `` militants '' through the hills around the town . \nDamascus says some 120 security personnel were killed by `` armed gangs '' in the town on 6 June , and on Wednesday state TV said a `` mass grave '' containing three bodies had been found . \nAt the same time , troops and tanks are reported to be massing for an attack on Maarat al-Numan , 25 miles -LRB- 40km -RRB- south-east of Jisr al-Shughour . \nOne eye-witness told BBC Arabic there were `` no more than 7,000 people '' left in the city , which has a population of some 90,000 . \nSyrian state media have reported attacks on government buildings and security headquarters in the town , which straddles the main highway between Syria 's two biggest cities , Damascus and Aleppo . \nMeanwhile , Jordan said it had reopened a border crossing 10km from the southern Syrian city of Deraa , where the current unrest started in March . \nAlthough it has not yet responded to the UN report , Syria has expressed `` surprise '' at Arab League Chief Amr Moussa 's position that the situation there was `` dangerous and worrying '' . \nSome 8,000 Syrians are now sheltering in refugee camps in Turkey Syrian rights groups put the overall death toll in Syria at 1,297 civilians and 340 security force members . \nRefugees arriving in Turkey describe the regime 's operation in the northern mountains as a `` scorched-earth '' campaign , and Syrian soldiers who deserted have said they were forced to commit atrocities . \nSyria has prevented foreign journalists , including those from the BBC , from entering the country , making it difficult to independently verify reports from there . \nEuropean powers are campaigning for a draft UN Security Council resolution condemning the crackdown , but they face opposition from Russia and China , both of whom wield veto powers and object to UN action against President Assad . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}

'' \nA Syrian general from a powerful family close to President Bashar al-Assad has defected and is on his way to Paris , French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius has said . \nMr Fabius described it as a `` hard blow for the regime '' that showed Mr Assad 's entourage was beginning to realize the regime was unsustainable . \nBrig Gen Manaf Tlas fled Syria via Turkey , his family confirmed . \nIf confirmed , it would be the highest-level defection since the unrest began . \nPro-government website Syriasteps said earlier Gen Tlas had made an `` escape '' , adding the move was `` insignificant '' . \nEarlier rumors about his possible defection in March proved to be false . \nIf confirmed , this would be the highest level defection and the first from the inner circle around the Syrian president since the popular uprising against him started in March 2011 . \nThis would also be damaging and embarrassing for the Damascus government , as it would be explained as an indication that cracks are appearing at the top of the ruling establishment and could encourage other Sunni defections . \nThe close relationship between Manaf Tlas and Bashar Assad goes back to the mid 90s when Bashar ended his medical career in the UK and was recalled to Syria to be groomed for succession following his older brother and heir apparent Basil 's sudden death in a road accident in 1994 . \nThe Republican Guard , of which Manaf Tlas was a top leader , is the main force responsible for the security and protection of the Assad government and is commanded directly by the inner circle in the presidential palace . \nAs such it is thought that he has a clear understanding and insight into how the Syrian government works at the top level and how the decision-making process worked since the start of the uprising . \nSpeaking at a meeting of Friends of Syria in Paris , Mr Fabius said : `` A senior official from the Syrian regime , a commander in the Republican Guard , has defected and is headed to Paris . '' '' \n-LRB- Mr Assad 's -RRB- close entourage is beginning to understand that the regime is unsustainable , '' he added . \n`` Even those close to Assad have begun to understand that one can not support a slaughterer like Bashar al-Assad . '' \nHis father , former Defense Minister Mustafa Tlas , is reportedly living in France . \nBrig Gen Tlas 's intentions may only become clear if and when he appears in public to outline his plans , the BBC 's James Reynolds on the Turkish-Syrian border reports . \nAmer al-Sadeq , a member of a Damascus-based opposition group , described the latest development as `` a good sign '' . \n`` Defecting soldiers , we see many of them , defecting officers , the more they come the better it is to make the regime weaker , '' Mr Sadeq told the BBC . \nBrig Gen Tlas , believed to be in his mid-40s , is a commander of a unit of the elite Republican Guard . \nAs a young man he attended military training with President Assad . \nBrig Gen Tlas has been under a form of home arrest since May 2011 because he opposed the security solution that the regime has been implementing , sources say . \nHe also was the first government official to meet the opposition back last year to try to start a dialogue and find a political solution to the 16-month crisis . \nUnlike most of Syria 's Alawite leaders , the son of former Defense Minister Mustafa Tlas is a Sunni Muslim . \nSyria 's majority Sunni community has been at the forefront of the revolt against the president and has borne the brunt of the state 's crackdown , which the UN estimates has left at least 10,000 people dead . \nFor decades , the Tlas family has given support to the Assad family , helping to ensure Bashar al-Assad 's succession to the presidency 12 years ago . \nManaf Tlas 's father , Mustafa , was Syria 's defense minister If Manaf Tlas ' permanent departure from Syria is confirmed , it would mark the first break of a member of President Assad 's close circle , correspondents say . \nObservers believe that the move may encourage other Sunni officers to consider their allegiances . \nGen Tlas 's departure comes as French President Francois Hollande is hosting a Paris Friends of Syria conference with representatives of more than 100 countries to try to find a way to end the violence in Syria . \nUS Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urged the representatives to persuade Russia and China to end their support for the Syrian regime . \nMember of Syria 's most powerful Sunni family Son of former defense minister Member of the ruling Baath Party 's Central Committee Close friend of Bashar al-Assad `` I ask you to reach out to Russia and China and to not only urge but demand that they get off the sidelines and begin to support the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people , '' she said . \n`` I do n't think Russia and China believe they are paying any price at all , nothing at all , for standing up on behalf of the Assad regime . '' \nShe also called on the UN Security Council to pass a resolution imposing immediate sanctions on Syria , including under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter , allowing for the possibility of military force . \nThe Paris meeting follows similar events in Tunis and Istanbul which demanded tougher action against the Assad regime . \nRussia and China , which both hold vetoes in the Security Council , are not at the meeting . \nUN diplomats are working on a document calling for restrictions on commercial activity if Mr Assad fails to abide by UN and Arab League envoy Kofi Annan 's ceasefire plan and roadmap for a political transition . \nThe roadmap - announced last weekend by Annan after a meeting of world powers in Geneva - includes an interim government to enable the Syrian people to live '' independently and democratically '' . \nThe Western powers believe that Mr Assad should play no part in Syria 's future , but the roadmap allows Mr Assad an effective veto over any interim candidate he opposes . \nSome 15,800 people have died in more than a year of violence in Syria , activists say . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}

'' \nAlthough Russia and China were not explicitly named , Mrs Clinton had spoken earlier of both countries as remaining on the sidelines . \n`` I do n't think Russia and China believe they are paying any price at all , nothing at all , for standing up on behalf of the Assad regime . '' \nBut Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Gennady Gatilov said the US secretary of state 's remarks were `` inappropriate '' and worrying . \nHe told Interfax news agency that Mrs Clinton had appeared to contradict what had been agreed after a meeting of world powers in Geneva last weekend . \nMoscow and the US were among the countries backing Kofi Annan 's roadmap for political transition , which includes an interim government to enable the Syrian people to live '' independently and democratically '' . \nThe Western powers believe that Mr Assad should play no part in Syria 's future , but the roadmap allows Mr Assad an effective veto over any interim candidate he opposes . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}

{"id": "43", "time": "2011-11-29", "text": "Syria : The view from next door As Syria faces growing economic sanctions , diplomatic isolation and condemnation over what the United Nations calls `` gross human rights violations '' for its crackdown on protesters , the BBC 's Jim Muir considers how the country 's immediate neighbors are reacting and how the outcome to the crisis may affect them . \nNobody is watching events in Syria more closely than the Lebanese , because none of Syria 's other neighbors stands to be affected as profoundly as Lebanon by what turn the crisis takes . \nSyria occupied Lebanon militarily from 1976 until 2005 , when it withdrew its troops under international and local pressure following the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri . \nSyrian troops in Lebanon for 29 years from 1976 Syria withdrew its forces in 2005 but retains influence through ties with Hezbollah Syria denies role in 2005 killing of Lebanese PM , Rafik Hariri , which UN-backed tribunal is investigating -LRB- Sources : EU data on trade -LRB- 2010 -RRB- , IOM , UNRWA , CIA World Factbook -RRB- Despite the withdrawal , Syria remains the determining influence in Lebanese politics , and has staged a strong political comeback through its local allies , notably the two main Shia movements - Hezbollah and Amal - and their network of Lebanese partners in different communities . \nAttitudes to Syria - friendship or hostility - divide the Lebanese more than any other issue . \nThe Sunni-based alliance known as March 14 , headed by Rafik Hariri 's son Saad , is fiercely opposed . \nIts rivals , the Shia-dominated March 8 coalition headed by Hezbollah , are strongly allied to Damascus . \nMarch 14 has clearly been delighted by President Bashar al-Assad 's discomfiture , and has even been accused of smuggling arms and money across the border from Sunni areas to fuel the uprising . \nHezbollah and its allies have been dismayed in equal measure . \nIf the Syrian regime , based on the Shia-offshoot Alawite minority , were to collapse and the Sunni majority take over , Hezbollah 's lifeline from its Iranian patrons would risk being severed , leaving the movement weakened both in the Lebanese political arena and militarily vis-a-vis Israel . \nEither outcome in Syria - survival or downfall of the regime - raises a clear potential for violent repercussions in Lebanon as the fortunes of local actors rise or drop . \nThe sectarian fault lines that connect in Syria run sharply through Lebanon , and there have already been tensions between pro-regime Alawites and hostile Sunnis in the north of the country . \nThe crisis in Syria presents its powerful , non-Arab northern neighbor Turkey with both risks and opportunities . \nWhen the uprising broke out in March , relations between Ankara and Damascus were excellent . \nMr Assad had a strong rapport with Turkey 's moderate Islamist Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan , who threw himself immediately into trying to encourage a peaceful outcome . \nFriction over Turkish projects using water from Euphrates river Tension in 1990s over Kurdish separatist presence in Syria Turkey backs Arab League stance on Syria sanctions But repeated interventions with Mr Assad drew a blank , leaving the Turkish leadership disillusioned and angrily accusing the Syrians of breaking promises . \nThereafter , Ankara became convinced that the downfall of Syria 's Baathist regime was only a matter of time , and that the sooner it happened , the better . \nUnusually , Turkey began allowing the Syrian opposition to meet and make declarations on Turkish soil , and gave sanctuary to refugees and military deserters . \nIt has become increasingly tough on the Syrian regime , and even became involved in the Arab League sanctions meetings . \nThe bottom-line risks underlying Turkey 's reaction are clear . \nInstability on its southern border is anathema . \nIt could face big waves of refugees , as happened with Iraq in the early 1990s . \nTurkey is vulnerable to the manipulation of its large Kurdish minority , and there were official suspicions that Syria may have had a hand in encouraging recent attacks by the militant PKK . \nInstability in Syria also threatens vital trade routes linking Turkey to lucrative Arab markets . \nBut the pro-active role now played by Turkey goes beyond defense of its interests to a more ambitious pursuit of opportunities . \nRegime change in Damascus in favor of the Sunni majority would deal a severe blow to Syria 's strategic ally Iran , Turkey 's main competitor for regional influence . \nIt would create a vertical Sunni axis to break the Shia crescent that links Iran , Iraq in its post-2003 Shia-majority form , Alawite-ruled Syria , and Hezbollah-dominated Lebanon . \nLike Lebanon , Iraq has found it hard to take a coherent and unified national position on Syria because of its own internal divisions . \nThe Shia-dominated government led by Nouri Maliki has been generally supportive of Mr Assad - although barely two years ago relations were at rock bottom , with Baghdad accusing Damascus of harbouring Iraqi Baathists and sponsoring bomb explosions in the Iraqi capital . \n1-1 .4 million Iraqis are living in Syria Tension over smuggling of militants and weapons across porous border into Iraq Ties frozen for a year in 2009 in row over Baghdad attacks Regime change in Damascus would clearly not serve the interests of the Shia majority political forces in Iraq , which are influenced to greater or lesser degree by Iran . \nReports that militant Shia leader Moqtada Sadr has been sending fighters to help Mr Assad combat the uprising have been denied , but were nonetheless politically indicative . \nWere the Sunni majority to be empowered in Syria , that would give a boost to the Sunnis in Iraq , politically dominant under Saddam Hussein but now reduced to a largely disgruntled minority . \nIraqi Sunni leaders have been taking a much less sympathetic line towards Mr Assad and his regime than their Shia counterparts . \nThe western areas of Iraq adjacent to Syria are largely Sunni , with tribal ties spreading over the border into areas like al-Bukamal and Deir ez-Zor where there has been serious unrest - and suspicions of cross-border support . \nIf the Sunni majority took over in Syria , that could bolster Iraqi Sunni sentiment in the western al-Anbar province and elsewhere , where some Sunnis are starting to push for the kind of federal autonomy enjoyed by Iraqi Kurds in the north . \nIraq 's Kurdish areas also abut Kurdish-populated parts of north-east Syria . \nSo a scenario in which Syria disintegrated into civil and ethnic strife could see stronger cross-border ties emerging between the Kurds , strengthening their aspirations for nationhood . \nLike a spouse trapped in an unhappy but inescapable marriage , Jordan 's relationship with its powerful northern neighbor has fluctuated sharply over the years , ranging between extreme tension and cautious cordiality . \nThey are bound together by many neighbourly bonds that make Jordan extremely sensitive to change and instability in Syria . \nTrade worth $ 0.6 bn -LRB- # 0.4 bn -RRB- in 2010 Syria is a vital transport route for essential good being taken to Jordan Many tribes straddle frontier , relying on cross-border trade . \nKing Abdullah was the first Arab leader to say President Assad should step down Syria controls the headwaters of the River Jordan on which the kingdom depends for much of its water supply . \nIt also straddles the overland route vital to Jordan 's trade . \nHundreds of Jordanian students are placed in Syrian universities , and there are strong tribal and family ties that cross the borders . \nBut politically the two countries are chalk and cheese . \nJordan is firmly in the pro-Western camp and in 1994 became the second Arab country , after Egypt , to sign a peace agreement with Israel , leaving Syria more isolated in its efforts to regain the occupied Golan Heights . \nJordan is also a basically Sunni country , while Syria 's Sunni majority is ruled by a regime dominated by its Alawite minority . \nAt times of tension in the past , Syria has accused Jordan -LRB- where there are pockets of Islamist militancy in the north -RRB- of stirring unrest among the Sunnis . \nBecause of all these sensitivities and vulnerabilities , Jordan has been very low-key in its reaction to the crisis in Syria - which began in Deraa , a southern city with strong tribal and family ties across the nearby Jordanian border . \nJordanian officials recently admitted that some arms and ammunition had been making their way across the border , though they said they were trying to stop it . \nThe official policy is non-interference , and even strong criticism has been couched as advice rather than intervention . \nWhen King Abdullah suggested in November that Mr Assad should step down , he was careful to say that that was what he would do in his position , rather than calling on him to do so . \nAs a country which has fought two wars with Syria and continues to occupy part of its territory , Israel clearly has an enormous stake in the outcome of the Syrian crisis . \nBut where Israel 's national interest lies is far from clear , and its leaders have been very circumspect in commenting on Syrian developments . \nFought wars in 1948 , 1967 and 1973 Also fought in Lebanon during civil war there 1975-1990 Unresolved territorial dispute over the Golan Heights 495,000 Palestinian refugees are registered in Syria . \nDespite the Assad regime 's much-vaunted `` resistance '' to Israel , its sponsorship of militant groups such as Hezbollah and Hamas , and its alliance with Iran , Israeli leaders have been divided over whether the survival of the `` devil they know '' would be preferable to the uncertainties of regime change and the possibility , however remote , of a radical Islamist takeover . \nIn practice , despite the fact that there is no peace treaty between the two countries , Israel 's front line with Syria on the Golan plateau has been peaceful since a truce was concluded in 1974 - with the exception of two incidents earlier this year when the Syrians , perhaps hoping to distract attention from the internal turmoil , allowed Palestinian demonstrators to approach the front . \nUnder the Assad family , Syria has engaged in peace dialogue with Israel - most recently through Turkish intermediaries two years ago - but even the failure of those initiatives did not lead to trouble . \nSo in some ways , Israelis might see their favored scenario as the survival of a regime which has proven containable , even though in 2007 Israel carried out an air strike on what it believed to be a nascent nuclear plant near Deir ez-Zor . \nBut ideally from Israel 's standpoint , the regime would emerge weakened to the point of having to drop its alliances with Iran , Hezbollah and Hamas . \nHowever , events may already have gone too far for that , and some Israeli leaders have concluded that the regime is likely to fall in months , opening a wide range of possible scenarios . \nIronically , Israel 's proximity and the sensitivities it arouses are the strongest deterrent to Libya-style Western intervention in Syria . \n"}

'' \nState media had earlier said the army was now in full control of the district , reporting that hundreds of `` terrorist mercenaries '' had been arrested or killed . \nOn Wednesday , Syria 's state military launched a large operation to retake Aleppo from the rebel fighters , who overran some districts three weeks ago . \nAleppo is Syria 's largest city , and Salah al-Din is considered a vital supply route for government troops coming from the south . \nThere were reports of further clashes overnight in the districts of Hanano , Saif al-Dawla , Shaar and Shakur , said the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights , quoted by AFP . \nThe Local Co-ordination Committees network of activists also reported shelling and gunfire in several districts . \nThe Syrian Observatory said at least 26 people were killed in Aleppo on Wednesday - it said they were among 130 people killed across the country . \nIranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has said the foreign ministers ' summit in Tehran will be a gathering of countries with `` a correct and realistic position '' on the Syrian conflict . \nHe said it would be an opportunity `` to replace military clashes with political , indigenous approaches to settle the disputes '' . \nForeign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi was quoted by state media as saying `` 12 to 13 countries from Asia , Africa and Latin America '' would be taking part , but did not name them . \nKuwait 's foreign ministry told al-Seyassah newspaper it would not be sending a representative . \nLebanon has also said it will not attend while Russia is sending its ambassador and not Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov . \nThe BBC 's Jim Muir in Beirut says this is a meeting of people who are already close to Tehran and to the Syrian regime . \nThere is deep scepticism in the West about Iran assuming a peacemaker role , given its recent strong commitments to the survival of the Assad government , our correspondent adds . \nEarlier this week , Iran 's security chief Saeed Jalili visited President Assad in Damascus , to pledge Tehran 's support . \nMr Jalili said Syria was one part of a vital regional alliance which he described as the `` axis of resistance '' , which Tehran would not allow to be broken . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}

'' \nJonathan Marcus BBC Diplomatic Correspondent Syria is one of Iran 's most important allies - a pro-Iranian foothold in the Arab Middle East and an important conduit for contacts between Tehran and Hezbollah in Lebanon , and Hamas in the Gaza Strip . \nReports that members of Iran 's Revolutionary Guards may be active in Syria is one reason why 48 Iranians were seized by Syrian opposition fighters . \nThe exact status of those kidnapped remains unclear , but the fears for their safety are real enough . \nBut it is regional political considerations as much as their fate that is driving this burst of Iranian diplomacy . \nIran sees Turkey as a competitor for regional influence . \nTehran is alarmed at renewed ties between Egypt and Saudi Arabia which constitute , at least in part , a thinly-veiled alliance of `` moderate Sunni Islam '' against Shia Iran . \nThe ultimate fall of the Assad regime could leave Iran dangerously isolated . \nIts diplomatic activism is an effort to underscore that whatever happens it remains an essential regional player . \nCorrespondents say `` axis of resistance '' refers to Iran , Syria , Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas in Gaza . \nIran has accused Turkey and some Gulf states of arming the Syrian rebels , in collusion with Israel and the US . \nTehran says it is planning an international meeting on Syria on Thursday . \nIt is also trying to secure the release of a group of Iranians abducted by rebels from a bus in Damascus on Saturday . \nAs well as Mr Jalili 's visit to Damascus , Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi has been holding talks in the Turkish capital , Ankara . \nIn a letter made public late on Tuesday , Mr Salehi asked the UN for help in freeing the hostages . \nAn unconfirmed report from the rebels has suggested that three of the 48 hostages they are holding have been killed by army shelling . \nMr Jalili , who heads Iran 's supreme national security council and is considered a senior aide to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , told reporters that `` kidnapping innocent people is not acceptable anywhere '' , Iran 's official news agency Irna reported . \nIran 's Deputy Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian has said it holds the US responsible for the hostages ' safety . \nHe said the US was supporting `` terrorist groups '' and despatching weapons to Syria , and was therefore responsible for the lives of those abducted . \nRebels say the group are members of Iran 's Revolutionary Guard . \nTehran says they are pilgrims who had been heading for a Shia religious site . \nThe BBC 's Jim Muir , in neighbouring Lebanon , said Syrian state media were giving the impression of it being business as usual in Damascus , despite Monday 's defection . \nSyria 's information minister played down the significance of Mr Hijab 's departure . \nSyria was a state of institutions , Omran al-Zoubi said , and the flight of some of its individuals would not affect the state , however prominent they were . \nBut reports of defections have continued , with Turkey 's foreign ministry announcing on Twitter that a general was among more than 1,300 refugees who fled across the border overnight . \nThe number of Syrians who have crossed into Turkey has risen to 47,500 , Ankara says . \nCivilians have become caught up in further clashes in the northern city of Aleppo The UK said on Tuesday it was quadrupling its aid for refugees fleeing fighting in Syria . \nRiad Hijab , appointed as prime minister less than two months ago , is the most prominent Syrian figure to defect so far . \nAlthough his whereabouts are unclear , his spokesman appeared on al-Jazeera TV in neighbouring Jordan saying that the prime minister had fled Syria with his family and was in `` a safe location '' . \nUS Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said on Tuesday that the international community had to plan for the fall of the Syrian regime . \nSpeaking in South Africa , she said : `` The intensity of the fighting in Aleppo , the defections , really point out how imperative it is that we come together and work toward a good transition plan . '' \nOn the ground in Syria , clashes have been reported in Aleppo and the army is said to have stepped up its bombardment of the northern city . \nGovernment forces are trying to dislodge rebel fighters who say they control up to half of Aleppo . \nOpposition activists report intense attacks on rebel-held areas on the north-east and south-west sides of the city . \nState media said troops had clashed with `` terrorists '' in several places inflicting heavy losses . \nFurther deaths were reported in Damascus on Tuesday . \nState news agency Sana said a `` terrorist hideout '' had been stormed by security forces . \nBritish-based activist group Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 270 people were killed across Syria on Monday . \nIt said 61 civilians died in Aleppo province alone . \nActivists estimate more than 20,000 people have died since the uprising against President Assad began in March last year . \nReports of casualties often can not be independently verified . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n7th August 2012 - 15:54 Quite sad what is happening in Syria . \nBoth sides screaming Allahu ak bar and killing each other : Syrians against Syrian ...

'' \nSyria 's Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem : `` We behaved in a positive manner '' Reacting to the statement , Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem reiterated that Damascus has accepted the Arab League plan - with what he stated were minor amendments designed to safeguard Syrian sovereignty . \nSpeaking to reporters in Damascus , Mr Muallem said `` slow and steady '' discussions were needed and warned against `` haste and overreaction '' . \nHe also criticised the league , saying `` parts of the Arab world '' were using the organization as a `` tool '' to involve UN Security Council in the crisis . \nA Western-backed draft resolution condemning Syria 's crackdown has been vetoed in the Security Council by China and Russia . \nTensions between the Arab League and Syria have increased as violence has escalated in the country . \nAllow foreign journalists to work freely Last weekend the league suspended Syria 's membership after it failed to honor the terms of its peace plan . \nSyria said it had agreed to the plan in principle , but was seeking amendments . \nReports said it wanted to reduce the number of observers from 500 to 40 . \nCritics accused Damascus of stalling for time . \nMr Assad told the Sunday Times : `` The conflict will continue and the pressure to subjugate Syria will continue .

taking place in Syria 's second city , Aleppo , say reports , as rebel fighters try to take control from the army . \nPro-government troops are bombarding the city with shells and rocket fire , and there are reports that helicopter gunships are being used . \nActivists say at least 33 people have been killed across the country on Tuesday so far . \nNine of those are reported to have died during a prison revolt in Aleppo . \nSyrian state television says the government has now regained control of most areas of Damascus which had been captured by rebels last week . \nIt broadcast footage showing soldiers apparently securing and checking heavily shelled suburbs in southern Damascus and the bodies of `` terrorists '' it says were killed . \nBut a fierce battle is taking place for control of Aleppo , Syria 's commercial center , after rebels launched a major offensive at the weekend . \nHeavy shelling and rocket fire were reported overnight and into Tuesday as the government attempted to take back the seized districts . \nResidents and activists told Reuters news agency the two sides were battling close to the historic Old City . \nThe British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said helicopter gunships had fired on several districts of the city . \nThe BBC 's Wyre Davies , on the Turkish border with Syria , says losing Aleppo would be a serious blow to the government so it is determined to use its far superior weaponry to halt the rebels ' advance . \nActivists say at least nine people have died in the revolt in Aleppo prison , where security forces are reported to have opened fire and used tear gas on detainees . \nThe general sentiment is that everyone here in Aleppo is terrified '' Government officials had previously denied there had been a defection . \nThe activist group the Local Co-Ordination Committee -LRB- LCC -RRB- said there was a `` catastrophic humanitarian situation '' inside the Homs jail . \nThe group called for international help to prevent `` mass executions '' of prisoners . \nThe Observatory , which said two prisoners were killed at the jail on Saturday , said it had received reports that a group of judges had been sent to the jail to investigate the uprising , which began over the weekend . \n`` It is possible their presence might lead to summary executions , '' the head of the Observatory , Rami Abdel Rahman , told AFP . \nThe group says that , on Monday , more than 116 people were killed across Syria , and that at least 33 had died by early afternoon on Tuesday . \nMore than 1,260 civilians , rebels and government soldiers have died since the fighting in Damascus and elsewhere intensified on 15 July , it says . \nForeign journalists work under intense restrictions in Syria so

officials killed in the 18 July bombing in Damascus A commander of Iran 's Revolutionary Guards , Brig Gen Masoud Jazayeri , said `` decisive blows '' would be struck against Syria 's enemies , `` particularly the hated Arabs '' , if they intervened in the conflict , Iran 's semi-official Fars news agency reported . \nThe surge in fighting in Syria coincides with widespread concern over Syria 's stockpile of chemical weapons . \nInitially three weapons production plants , including Al Safir southeast of Aleppo , which has been redeveloped in recent years Chemical plants said to be active near Homs and Hama from early 1990s Suspected stocks of mustard gas , sarin gas and VX nerve gas from late 1990s Source : Janes , US state department , International Institute for Strategic Studies Both the US and UN gave clear warnings to Damascus after an official said on Monday that while such weapons would not be deployed inside Syria they could be used in response to external aggression . \nIsrael and the US are concerned the weapons could fall into the hands of Lebanon 's Shia Islamist group Hezbollah , allied to Syria 's President Bashar al-Assad , and be used to threaten Israel . \nA senior Israeli defense official , Amos Gilad , said the weapons were `` under the full control of the regime '' , Reuters news agency reports . \nThe FSA said in a statement on Tuesday that the government had begun moving its chemical weapons stockpile to airports on Syria 's border a few months ago , in an attempt to put pressure on the international community . \nOn Sunday , the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that at least 19,106 people had been killed since March 2011 . \nThe UN said in May that at least 10,000 people had been killed . \nSyria blames the violence on foreign-backed `` armed terrorist gangs '' . \nIn June , the Syrian government reported that 6,947 Syrians had died , including at least 3,211 civilians and 2,566 security forces personnel . \nHopes

'' \nMaya 's experience in prison helped her break through the barrier of fear . \nSince that day , she has become involved on a daily basis in the uprising . \nBut she is now concerned about being arrested and has gone into hiding . \n`` I had to run one day from them and hide under a car in a car park . \nToday , I have a year of work as an activist against the regime and if they get me , it wo n't be easy , '' she explains . \nMaya 's mother was detained for a week by the security services and interrogated repeatedly . \nShe was used as a tool to get her daughter . \nNow , Maya and her mother can only see each other in secret . \nMaya has long been involved in defending women 's rights in Syria , but she says her primary goal now is `` freedom '' . \nMany women and children have killed by security forces in the crackdown on dissent `` When you are under heavy gunfire , women 's rights are considered luxury . '' \nAlmost everyone you ask among the opposition says Syria 's uprising started in reaction to what happened in Deraa last March . \nLocals took to the streets after 14 children were arrested and tortured for writing on the walls of their schools the slogan of the popular uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt : `` The people want the downfall of the regime . '' \nThey wrote the graffiti because their school teacher was arrested for expressing her wish that the revolution would start in Syria . \nSince day one , women have been behind the dissemination of news about the protests in Syria and the state 's crackdown on them . \nRazan Zaitouneh , a human rights lawyer , has been among the main sources of such information . \nHer network of lawyers and human rights activists on the ground are telling the world what is happening in Syria . \nMs Zaitouneh , along with many other activists , formed an opposition network that is now called the Local Co-ordination Committees -LRB- LCC -RRB- . \nShe is now in hiding in Syria , having been accused of being a foreign agent . \nIn the search for her , security forces detained her husband and brother-in-law for weeks . \nWomen have also sought to challenge critics of the uprising , who have said it is dominated by conservative Islamists and is sectarian in nature . \nIn the suburbs , where women used to stay at home ... -LRB- they now -RRB- get out of their houses and speak out loud '' End Quote Rana Opposition activist Many have pointed to video and pictures of anti-government protests across the country , at which the faces of the majority of women are covered . \nActivists say this is not because the women are conservative Sunni Muslims , but because they need to hide their faces out of fear of arrest . \n`` Women from all parts of society are involved in the protest movement - Christians and Muslims , liberals and conservatives , '' says Rana , a 25-year-old secular Muslim who has been active in the protest movement along with her husband since the start of the uprising . \nRana points to an example from Harasta , a suburb of Damascus , where women ignored the belief held by many conservatives that they should not sing in public and chanted : `` A woman 's voice is a revolution and a man 's silence is a sin .

'' \nSyria - which is not among the 159 nations signed up to the 1997 Ottawa Treaty banning the production , use and stockpiling of anti-personnel mines - has not publicly commented on the claims . \nThe size and origin of Syria 's stockpile of landmines is not clear , HRW said , but is thought to consist mostly of Russian-made weapons - some Soviet-era - such as PMN-2 anti-personnel mines and TMN-46 anti-vehicle mines . \nReports that Syrian troops were laying landmines first emerged last November , when a government official told the Associated Press news agency : `` Syria has undertaken many measures to control the borders , including planting mines . '' \nThe BBC 's Jonathan Head , reporting from Hatay on the Turkish side of the border with Syria , says he has seen refugees arrive who have lost limbs because of the mines . \nHe says the refugee camp at Hatay , run by the Turkish Red Crescent , is receiving up to 200 refugees a day as they flee the army assault on the city of Idlib and surrounding villages just across the border in Syria . \nKofi Annan , the former UN chief who has been appointed by the UN and Arab League to find a peaceful solution to the crisis in Syria , had what he called a `` useful meeting '' with the opposition Syrian National Council -LRB- SNC -RRB- . \nUK Foreign Secretary William Hague : ` The UN has failed on Syria ' He said they `` promised their full co-operation , which will be necessary if we are going to succeed '' . \nMr Annan , who is on the second day of his visit to Turkey , said he expected a response from Damascus later on Tuesday to `` concrete proposals '' he put forward during his meeting in Syria with President Bashar al-Assad . \n`` Once I receive their answer we will know how to react , '' he added . \nMr Annan has said his peace mission has three objectives ; to bring about a ceasefire , provide access for humanitarian aid and start political dialogue . \nBut he admitted on Monday , after talks with Turkey 's Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara , that the diplomatic process would take time and described the situation in Syria as `` very complex '' . \nOn Monday , UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urged the international community to speak with one voice on Syria . \nMrs Clinton told the UN Security Council that Syria 's `` horrific campaign of violence '' had `` shocked the conscience of the world '' . \n`` We believe that now is the time for all nations - even those who have previously blocked our efforts - to stand behind the humanitarian and political approach spelled out by the Arab League .

'' \nA senior official with the main aid agency working inside Syria , the Syrian Arab Red Crescent -LRB- SARC -RRB- , agreed . \n`` Some homeless people in Damascus are now having to live in schools , '' said Khaled Erksoussi of SARC , on the phone from Syria . \nThere was a sharp increase in the number of people living in such temporary accommodation this weekend when it became apparent that between 8,000 and 10,000 residents of the capital were seeking help of this sort . \nMany Syrians have fled across the northern border into Turkey `` They 're having to manage by living close to other families , '' Mr Erksoussi added . \n`` But these are urban people who are used to life in a big city . \nThey 're just not used to cooking together , for example . \nSome of them have lived for years in apartment blocks not knowing their neighbors . \nNow they 're having to rethink everything . '' \nFigures supplied by the UNHCR show the number of people forced to flee Syria is on the increase . \nJordan : 35,000 officially registered with the UN . \n1,000 a day arriving -LRB- on Sunday 22 July -RRB- . \nBut the Jordanian government tells the UN there are in fact between 90,000 and 150,000 Syrians inside Jordan - they just have not registered with the UN yet . \nLebanon : 30,000 Syrian refugees officially registered with the UN . \n18,000 arrived on 18-19 July alone , but are yet to register . \nTurkey : Camps here are run by the Turkish government , not UN . \nAnkara says there are 42,000 people in the camps . \nIraq : 7,500 - 10,000 Syrian refugees , most in Kurdish areas . \nWhile life in the refugee camps may be harsh and unexpected , the scale of suffering inside Syria appears to be on a much larger scale . \n`` We estimate that there are one-and-a-half million displaced people throughout the country , '' said Mr Erksoussi . \n`` But so far we have only helped about 950,000 of them with some food or medicines . '' \nMr Erksoussi said he thought that about 10 % of the entire Syrian population - or some 2.5 million people - had been directly affected by the conflict . \nThis includes people who have lost their jobs , for example , or families who are hosting the displaced in their homes or flats . \nThere have been two main international appeals for cash to help the homeless inside and outside Syria . \nThese appeals are separate to aid given directly , for example , by the Turkish government to the refugees in the camps it runs . \nThe first appeal was by UN agencies and non-governmental charities for refugees outside Syria . \nIt asked for $ 193m -LRB- # 124m -RRB- and has got approximately 25 % of that so far . \nThe second appeal was for those displaced inside Syria . \nIt asked for $ 180m and has also reached about a quarter of that target . \n`` We are urging all the countries who talk so much about caring for Syria to put their money where their mouths are , '' said Mr Erksoussi . \nHe said he was also appealing to all those engaged in the conflict to respect the neutrality of his volunteers . \nHe said five Syrian Red Crescent workers had been killed so far . \n`` That includes one who was sitting in the passenger seat of my car when I was driving . \nHe was shot by an unknown gunman and he died , '' he said . \n`` I appeal to everyone . \nYou can ask us for our ID papers in any language you like , but please do not use the language of the gun against unarmed volunteers . \nThere is no need to shoot us .

international response came hours after Syrian foreign ministry spokesman Jihad Makdissi gave Damascus 's first implicit acknowledgement that a chemical weapons stockpile existed . \nThe weapons were safely stored , he said , and Syria would never use them against its civilians but only `` in case of external aggression '' . \nIn an attempt to retain some doubt about his country 's unconventional weapons arsenal he later tweeted `` if they exist '' . \nThe US and Israel have expressed concern about the fate of Syria 's arms , with Israeli PM Benyamin Netanyahu speaking of a `` great threat '' of weapons sites falling into the hands of Lebanon 's Shia Islamist group Hezbollah , allied to President Assad . \nThe State Department in Washington said any possible use of such weapons would be ``

'' \nMr Lavrov urged the international community to co-operate with Mr Annan 's mission . \n`` This means no interference in Syria 's internal affairs and the inadmissibility of supporting one side in the conflict , '' the statement said . \nThe BBC 's Steve Rosenberg in Moscow says that these remarks suggest a very delicate balancing act by Moscow - on the one hand seeking to put pressure on Mr Assad and on the other warning the West not to favor the Syrian opposition . \nMeeting Mr Medvedev , Mr Annan said that `` Syria has an opportunity today to work with me and this mediation process to put an end to the conflict , to the fighting , allow access to those in need of humanitarian assistance as well as embark on a political process '' . \nHe has proposed a six-point peace plan , which calls on government forces to immediately halt the use of heavy weapons in populated areas . \nHe also wants the armed rebels to halt their attacks - which seems unlikely to happen either , says the BBC 's Jim Muir in Beirut . \nHoms has been relentlessly targeted , activists say Russia has vetoed two UN Security Council resolutions on the crisis in Syria , but last week , with China , supported a UN statement on the Annan mission . \nOur correspondent says that recently there have been signs Moscow is losing patience with Syria . \nSenior Russian officials have criticised the Syrian government for dragging its heels on reform , and accused it of making numerous mistakes . \nMeanwhile US President Barack Obama and Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan , meeting ahead of a nuclear security conference in South Korea , said they were looking for ways to bring about change in Syria . \nThe diplomacy comes as a new report by New York based Human Rights Watch -LRB- HRW -RRB- accused pro-government forces of forcing civilians to march in front of them as they advanced on areas held by the opposition in the northern Idlib province earlier in March . \nVideos obtained by HRW from opposition activists showed people dressed in civilian clothes walking in front of armed soldiers and fighting vehicles . \nWitnesses told HRW it was clear that the move was to protect the army from attack . \nAccording to the HRW statement , residents also said children had been placed on tanks and inside security buses . \nIn another development , the opposition Free Syrian Army and a rival military council have announced that they will work together to co-ordinate all military activity against the Syrian government . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}

a violation of Syria 's commitment to a UN-backed peace plan . \nThe observers saw pools of blood and bullet cases but have not determined the number of dead , who they were , or exactly who carried out the attack . \nThey did say the attack appeared to target specific houses or buildings used by army defectors or opposition activists . \nThis runs counter to some of the villagers ' accounts , which said that army tanks had randomly bombarded the village for several hours before pro-government militiamen swept in , shooting and stabbing victims , including civilians , at close range . \nSome reports say up to 200 people were killed . \nBut the government now says that only 37 people , including two civilians , died in the attack . \nIt also strongly rejected UN allegations that it used helicopters , aircraft or heavy weapons , saying only troops carriers and small arms , including rocket-propelled grenades , were deployed . \nThe government said five buildings housing what it termed `` armed terrorists '' had been targeted and that the area was too small to use tanks . \nActivist groups have been unable to determine a death toll . \nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights group said it had the names of 103 dead , including 50 rebel fighters . \nOther activists say many more bodies are lying in fields that residents can not reach because of army checkpoints . \nThe observers are continuing their investigation . \nCorrespondents say evidence has not yet been produced of any civilian massacre , although this remains one of the deadliest single incidents since the beginning of the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad in March 2011 . \nTremseh is a predominantly Sunni Muslim farming village about 35km -LRB- 20 miles -RRB- north-west of the city of Hama , surrounded by villages dominated by Alawites , the Shia heterodox sect to which President Assad belongs . \nAccording to initial accounts from activists and witnesses , a convoy of more than a dozen vehicles , containing uniformed soldiers and members of a pro-government militia - known as `` shabiha '' - as well as tanks and artillery , surrounded Tremseh at about 06:00 -LRB- 03:00 GMT -RRB- on Thursday , searching for members of the rebel Free Syrian Army -LRB- FSA -RRB- . \nAn image said to show relatives grieving for the dead in Tremseh A resident of the nearby Kfar Hod , Abu Mohammed , told the New York Times that the soldiers and tanks were deployed to the east of the village , from where they opened fire with heavy weapons and machine-guns . \nShabiha were deployed along the western edge of Tremseh and `` fired at anyone or any car that tried to leave the village '' , he added . \nThe River Orontes provided a natural barrier to the south . \nAn account published on Thursday afternoon said the electricity and telephone lines were also cut , causing people to gather in the streets `` in a state of fear and panic '' , `` unable to flee because of the blockade '' . \nIt appears that there were members of the Free Syrian Army in the village , but it is not clear how many and to what extent they resisted . \nActivists and witnesses said shabiha militiamen swept into the village after the bombardment . \nMany people were shot or stabbed , and dozens of bodies were burned or dumped in the streets , they added . \nThe UN Stabilisation Mission in Syria -LRB- Unsmis -RRB- confirmed there had been `` continuous fighting '' on Thursday in the Tremseh area , which had `` involved mechanised units , indirect fire , as well as helicopters '' . \nActivists later published a video online purportedly showing the blood-stained bodies of at least 15 young men laid out on blankets on a concrete floor , their faces or shirts drenched in blood . \nSome had wounds in their heads and chests . \nMost of the men were wearing jeans and t-shirts , though one had a camouflage jacket . \n3 Feb : At least 55 killed in Homs in month-long bombardment by military 3 Apr : Military attack on Taftanaz in Idlib . \nMass graves said to hold 57 people 25 May : Some 108 killed in Taldou , in Houla region , many of them women and children 6 Jun : At least 79 people , many of them women and children , killed in village in Hama province Another video showed an alleged survivor of the killings . \nThe narrator accused the government of `` ethnic cleansing '' . \nAbu Mohammed said he had visited Tremseh after the killings and seen bodies in fields , on streets and in homes . \nHe said about 50 bodies had been pulled out of the River Orontes , and that most of the victims were farmers . \nThe Local Co-ordination Committees , an opposition activist network , reported that more than 220 people had been killed in Tremseh . \nIt said : `` The same methodology , tools and means as previous massacres was used : forces of the regime 's army shelled the town , shabiha then stormed the town and killed and slaughtered individuals and then burned the wounded and the bodies of the martyrs . '' \nJaafar , an activist with the opposition Sham News Network -LRB- SNN -RRB- , told the AFP news agency most of those killed had been FSA fighters . \n`` At this stage , though we do not yet have the final count , the number of civilians killed by shelling is not more than seven , '' he said . \nThe state news agency , Sana , said `` tens of terrorists '' had overrun Tremseh , killing or wounding dozens of civilians and ransacking or destroying scores of houses . \nIt cited a witness , Abu Arif al-Khalid , who said the assailants had `` opened fire on -LRB- Tremseh 's -RRB- inhabitants and houses at random , killing more than 50 people , and blowing up houses '' . \n`` A woman and her child were killed by the terrorists before the eyes of all the people there , added Abu Arif al-Khalid , '' Sana reported . \nSecurity forces only arrived at the village after receiving calls from residents , officials said . \nOnce there , the troops clashed with the attackers , `` inflicting huge losses upon them , capturing scores of them , confiscating their weapons , among which were Israeli-made machine-guns '' , the Sana report added . \nSome of those captured were paraded on state TV , which also showed large quantities of arms and ammunition it said were seized . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}

'' \nJim Muir BBC News , Beirut The defection of Nawaf Fares is an embarrassing blow to the Syrian regime , and a clear sign of the stress the conflict is generating , but it does not necessarily herald a spate of similar desertions . \nThe government 's discomfort was reflected in an official statement from the foreign ministry in Damascus , lamely announcing that the ambassador had been `` relieved of his duties '' . \nUS and Syrian opposition officials seized on Mr Fares 's resignation as a sign that the regime is crumbling . \nBut the defection of the deputy oil minister earlier this year did not trigger a cascade of similar moves by officials , as he urged . \nAs with the case of Manaf Tlas , who fled the country last week , the ambassador may have had specific reasons for turning . \nHe is a Sunni tribal leader whose area around Deir al-Zour has been heavily battered by government forces recently , as had Gen Tlas 's mainly Sunni hometown Rastan . \nThe defections are clearly a sign of the times , but given the gravity of what is happening , it is surprising they have been so few and far between . \nLast week , it emerged that Brig-Gen Tlas had escaped Syria via Turkey , in what correspondents described as a significant blow to the Assad regime . \nBut it was unclear whether the general would support President Bashar al-Assad 's opponents in their efforts to overthrow the leader . \nMeanwhile , Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshiyar Zebari said Mr Fares , who defected on Wednesday , was in Qatar , a country sympathetic to the rebels . \nMr Fares , the first senior diplomat to abandon Mr Assad , has urged other politicians and military figures to follow suit . \nSyria responded by formally dismissing Mr Fares from his post . \nHis defection was first reported by Qatar-based TV channel al-Jazeera . \nHe confirmed his decision in a statement broadcast both on TV and on Facebook . \nWith Syrian revolutionary flags behind him , he read out the statement saying he was resigning both as Syria 's ambassador to Iraq and as a member of the ruling Baath Party . \n`` I call on all party members to do the same because the regime has transformed it into a tool to oppress the people and their aspirations to freedom and dignity . \n`` I announce , from this moment on , that I am siding with the people 's revolution in Syria , my natural place in these difficult circumstances which Syria is going through .

'' \nThis theme was echoed in a commentary in the United Arab Emirates ' Al-Ittihad newspaper , which warned of a change to `` the regional balance of power stretching from the Gulf , Iran to Lebanon '' . \nA commentary in Turkey 's Vatan said the Assad regime did `` not have much time left '' , which poses a problem to its `` closest ally '' Iran . \nMilliyet pointed to a global balance-of-power issue which may see the US using the Arab Spring as an `` excuse further to strengthen its position in the Middle East '' . \nIt said this should be of concern to Russia , which has supported both Syria and Iran , and places Turkey in an awkward position because of its `` unhesitant '' stance on the crisis . \nSyrian Twitter users were generally observed to be calling for more action from the Arab League . \nAddressing the League , prominent Deraa-based user @Taimhawi wrote : `` Your sanctions wo n't stop bloodshed , people want : a no-fly zone , isolated zone , expel ambassadors , support Free Syrian Army . '' \nDamascus-based @Sub7ei , a user with over 900 followers , took a similar line , calling on the League to take a firmer position through `` recognition of the National Council and explicitly inviting Assad to step down '' . \nSimilar sentiments were conveyed in a cartoon posted to the Jordan-based satirical website Mahjoob which was linked to by a number of Twitter users . \nIn the image , a meat-cleaver-wielding Assad is depicted butchering a corpse while Arab League delegates look on passively . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}

'' \nThe protests in Syria first centred on southern Deraa , an agricultural hub once considered a government stronghold . \nThey later spread to Latakia in the north , birthplace of former President Hafez al-Assad , and the Mediterranean coastal town of Baniyas , which has a strong conservative Sunni Muslim constituency . \nIt was then that the protests moved west to Homs , and to west-central Hama , the site of a brutally suppressed uprising by the Muslim Brotherhood in 1982 . \nBut it is the bombardment by the Syrian government on rebel parts of Homs that has captured the headlines in recent months . \nWhile the international community wrangled over how to deal with the situation in Syria in early February , reports from inside the city described days of relentless shelling of rockets and mortars . \nThe BBC 's Paul Wood , undercover in the city at the time , described how civilians were having to bury their dead during the night because it was too dangerous during the day . \nSyrian state television denied any bombardment , saying residents were setting fire to piles of rubbish on the roofs of their homes to trick the world into thinking that there was an attack . \nThe government said its troops were fighting `` armed terrorist '' gangs who were killing civilians in Homs . \nThe rebel Free Syrian Army have found themselves outgunned by government forces But correspondents in the city said the rebel soldiers of the Free Syria Army -LRB- FSA -RRB- were armed only with guns , no match for the artillery they faced . \nSnipers and tanks were reported on the streets as the bombardment centred on the district of Baba Amr . \nOn 21 February , Sunday Times journalist Marie Colvin spoke to the BBC of `` shelling with impunity , with merciless disregard for civilians '' . \nA day later , she and French photographer Remi Ochlik were killed in an attack on their makeshift media center . \nThe Syrian government launched its ground offensive into the district at the end of February , and on 1 March the FSA announced a `` tactical withdrawal '' from Baba Amr , saying they did not have enough weapons to defend the civilians . \nThe Red Cross was allowed into Homs to deliver humanitarian aid and help the wounded , but was refused entry into Baba Amr . \nThe UN 's humanitarian chief Valerie Amos was allowed to visit Homs on 7 March and spent an hour in Baba Amr . \nShe said the city had been `` completely devastated '' . \nReports of mass shootings , mainly of members of the same family , continue . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}

'' \nMany Christians - who together with Alawites make up about 10 % of Syria 's population - also feel they are walking a tightrope , scared of falling between the hammer of the regime and anvil of the rebels , and apprehensive about what the revolution may bring . \nAcross Syria , you will receive different answers to the question of who is `` playing the sectarian card '' in the uprising . \nThe opposition accuses the regime of seeking to sow panic and fear in a country where there are 29 religious minorities and ethnicities . \nSome Syrians are furious at both the regime and the opposition , accusing them both of destroying the country '' The regime meanwhile accuses the opposition of militarising the conflict and of `` Wahhabism '' , the strict interpretation of Sunni Islam adhered to by Saudi Arabia and Qatar , both countries that have condemned the crackdown on protests and advocated arming rebel groups . \nState media and government spokespersons are invoking the experiences of other Arab states , including Iraq and Libya , when warning of what might happen if `` mercenary elements '' succeed . \nSyrians who accept this message repeat the affirmation that their country is being targeted by outside powers and that `` the Arabs are the first to betray them '' . \nDespite this , the authorities have not jammed `` hostile '' foreign satellite channels or blocked internet services nationwide . \nHowever , telecommunications are frequently cut in opposition strongholds and I found it hard to receive calls or text messages from overseas and to communicate via the internet from my hotel , using services such as Skype . \nMoreover , state media boasted while I was in Syria that Air Force Intelligence had been able to monitor communications between Arab satellite TV stations and activists on the ground in Homs , and that they had hacked the activists ' satellite phones . \nArab journalists visiting Syria are viewed with suspicion by both the government and the opposition alike - there is no middle ground . \nThe regime 's supporters blame a `` media conspiracy '' for what is happening in Syria , noting that the Arab TV stations `` supported '' the uprising from the start . \nHamadiya market in central Damascus was bustling despite the power cuts The opposition meanwhile categorises every report from foreign media as `` with us '' or `` against us '' , and does not hesitate to accuse organizations of pro-regime bias . \nJournalists covering the opposition side and the armed resistance are smuggled across the borders with Lebanon and Turkey , while those granted a visa from the Syrian authorities - as I was - have to adhere to their rules . \nI only visited three cities - Damascus , Aleppo and Latakia - but no-one told me who to meet or what to say . \nOne simple event provoked laughter though . \nOne evening in Damascus , I persuaded my colleague to return to our hotel as he was feeling ill . \nI then wandered through the city markets and street alone . \nThe next day , he received a telephone call from a member of the security services asking him what I had been doing . \nAs it happens , I had interviewed a member of the opposition right in the middle of a demonstration by Assad supporters . \nHe described the government supporters all around him as `` simpletons who the regime and state media had fattened on fear '' . \nHowever , it is fair to say that part of the barrier of fear has been broken . \nMany Syrians say things and speak about issues that were forbidden a year ago . \nBut fear does remain , a legacy of the past . \nThe regime is betting on class and sectarian interests to keep it in power There are four pillars of the security apparatus in Syria - Military Intelligence , the General Security Directorate , Air Force Intelligence , and the Political Security Directorate - and they do not necessarily agree with each other . \nIt reminded me of what had happened to me when I arrived at Damascus airport with my equipment . \nI had to deal with representatives of all four agencies at the same time . \nThe first decided that my satellite phone was prohibited ; the second searched my protective jacket and helmet and let them through , the third searched my computer equipment and personal belongings , while the fourth checked my papers . \nThey finished with an apology , but it showed a desire to follow the rules more out of fear than out of a desire to mitigate risk . \nThe question I tried to ask everyone I met in Syria was whether they thought the regime could contain this crisis . \nOne journalist close to power answered simply : `` Maybe , but it will be a miracle . '' \nEqually , it seems pretty certain that many Syrians have not yet made up their minds . \nAnd some are furious at both the regime and the opposition , accusing them both of destroying the country . \nYou can walk around Damascus at night and , despite the electricity cuts , the restaurants and cafes are full and buzzing . \nHere , they do not hear the conflict or see the blood . \nThe regime is betting on class and sectarian interests to keep it in power . \nThe army remains committed to national defense and the preservation of the state To counter the economic sanctions imposed by the European Union and United States , the government has tried to institute a bartering system to sell what goods and produce it has in return for goods it does not have . \nIt has also sought to mitigate electricity shortages by ending the state 's monopoly on power generation and getting the private sector involved . \nThis has helped the regime co-opt businessmen and dissipate the public outrage over the power cuts . \nMeanwhile , the army has remained coherent in its commitment to national defense and the preservation of the state - or the perhaps the privileges enjoyed by its commanders . \nDuring my trip to Syria , I became used to seeing the coffins of dead soldiers at airports , surrounded by weeping relatives . \nI overheard the stories of conscripts from rural areas ; some of them spoke of their heroics but others spoke of the suspicion that their commanders treated them with , fearful of them leaving and not returning to their military service . \nAccording to many , the army is the only thing standing between the survival of the regime and its fall . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}

'' \nIn a clear reference to China and Russia , she appealed to the international community to `` say with one voice - without hesitation or caveat - that the killing of innocent Syrians must stop and a political transition must begin '' . \nHer words echoed those of British Foreign Secretary William Hague , and of Mr Ban who said the Syrian government had `` failed to fulfil its responsibility to protect its own people and instead has subjected its citizens in several cities to military assault and disproportionate use of force '' . \nHe said the Council must `` unite strongly '' behind UN and Arab League peace envoy Kofi Annan 's efforts `` to help Syria pull back from the brink of a deeper catastrophe '' . \nUK Foreign Secretary William Hague : ` The UN has failed on Syria ' Russia 's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the situation in Syria remained a `` grave concern '' but warned that change in the Arab world `` must not be achieved by misleading the international community or manipulating the Security Council '' . \nAfter the meeting , he said the Russian government was in regular contact with Syrian authorities and dismissed suggestions that Russia 's opposition to any resolution was single-handedly preventing a solution to the crisis . \n`` The founding fathers of the UN decided that unless the permanent members agreed on something , decisions could not be sustainable . \nLet 's try to be respectful of each other and each other 's positions , '' he said . \nBut UK Foreign Minister William Hague struck a more positive note . \n`` I think it is encouraging that the foreign minister of Russia and the Arab League had a discussion and the need for a political process has been recognized by Foreign Minister Lavrov , something we and many Arab ministers have called for all along , '' he said . \nThe attack in the embattled city of Homs happened hours after Mr Annan ended his two-day mission to Damascus . \nHoms has been under assault for weeks as government forces have tried to root out rebel fighters . \nParts of the city are devastated . \nHundreds of families fled the Karm el-Zeytoun area of Homs on Monday after reports of the attack in their neighborhood overnight , the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said . \nOne activist in Homs , Hadi Abdallah , told AFP the bodies of 26 children and 21 women were found , some with their throats slit and others bearing stab wounds . \nBoth the opposition Syrian Revolution General Commission -LRB- SRGC -RRB- and the Local Co-ordination Committees -LRB- LCC -RRB- , an activist network in Syria , put the toll at 45 . \nThe SRGC said that some of the victims had been burned alive with heating fuel poured over them and others had their necks and limbs broken . \nMulham al-Jundi , an opposition activist and member of the SNC , said Karm el-Zeytoun was experiencing a military bombardment similar to the one seen in Baba Amr district in recent weeks . \nThe BBC 's Jon Donnison : ` The Syrian government has acknowledged these deaths ' Reports are difficult to verify because of tight restrictions on independent media operating in Syria . \nFootage posted on YouTube , said to show the bodies of men , women and children killed in the attack , made for grim viewing , said the BBC 's Jon Donnison in neighbouring Lebanon . \nIn one video , at least 11 bodies can be seen , including at least four young children covered in blood , he adds . \nSyrian state television accused `` armed terrorist gangs '' of carrying out the killings , saying the bodies had been filmed in an effort to discredit the government . \nBoth the LCC and the Observatory blame the pro-government Shabiha militia for the attack . \nThe group has been blamed for many of the atrocities carried out since the uprising began nearly a year ago . \nKofi Annan left Syria on Sunday after two days of talks with President Assad , saying he was `` optimistic '' about the possibility of a ceasefire , humanitarian access to affected areas and future political dialogue . \nHe said he had presented Mr Assad with `` concrete proposals '' to bring an end to the bloodshed , but gave no hint that a deal was imminent . \nReports say Mr Annan is due to meet representatives of the opposition Syrian National Council in the Turkish city of Istanbul on Tuesday . \nAre you in Syria ?

'' \nActivists reported on Thursday that government forces had been shelling several towns , including Homs , Deraa and the Douma suburb of Damascus . \nThere has also been a huge rise in the number of refugees crossing from Syria into Turkey , with 2,350 over a 24-hour period from Wednesday to Thursday , more than double the highest previous total . \nThe BBC 's Jim Muir in Beirut says the activists are giving the clear impression that the Syrian regime is having a final crack at rebels before the ceasefire deadline . \nSyrian-led political process to address the aspirations and concerns of the Syrian people 2 . \nUN-supervised cessation of armed violence in all its forms by all parties to protect civilians 3 . \nAll parties to ensure provision of humanitarian assistance to all areas affected by the fighting , and implement a daily two-hour humanitarian pause 4 . \nAuthorities to intensify the pace and scale of release of arbitrarily detained persons 5 . \nAuthorities to ensure freedom of movement throughout the country for journalists 6 . \nAuthorities to respect freedom of association and the right to demonstrate peacefully Earlier Mr Ban urged members of the General Assembly to deepen their support for Mr Annan 's efforts because of the deteriorating situation on the ground . \n`` Despite the Syrian government 's acceptance of the joint special envoy 's plan of initial proposals to resolve the crisis , the violence and assaults in civilian areas have not stopped , '' he said . \n`` The situation on the ground continues to deteriorate . '' \nMeanwhile the International Committee of the Red Cross -LRB- ICRC -RRB- said that Syrian officials had agreed to it having an `` expanded presence '' in the country . \nSpeaking of the expanded Red Cross presence , ICRC President Jakob Kellenberger , who is at talks in Damascus , said : `` This means that we will have to rapidly build up our human resources and logistical capacity in Syria . \n10 April : Government must withdraw troops and heavy weapons such as tanks from towns , cities and villages Following 48 hours : Ceasefire to be implemented on the ground with the onus on the opposition to follow the government 's lead 06:00 local time on 12 April : All forms of violence must be stopped on all sides Next step : All parties to hold talks on a political solution `` This agreement is a sign of trust in the ICRC 's independent and neutral humanitarian action . \nIt should enable the ICRC and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent to meet increased humanitarian needs . '' \nThe two sides also agreed procedures for humanitarian ceasefires and visits to places of detention , the ICRC statement said . \nThe UN says the conflict has cost more than 9,000 lives since it began a year ago . \nThe Syrian government blames violence on `` terrorist gangs '' and says some 3,000 members of the security forces have been killed . \nForeign media face severe restrictions on reporting in Syria , and it is hard to verify the claims of either side . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}

'' \nThe BBC 's Jon Donnison says video purporting to show security forces looting homes has emerged They said the international community must give its full support to Kofi Annan , the former UN secretary general who is acting as the UN and Arab League 's envoy to Syria . \nMr Annan visited Syria last week to deliver a proposed peace plan to Mr Assad , and is to brief the UN Security Council on his mission on Friday . \nThe plan includes demands for an immediate ceasefire by both sides , access for humanitarian aid , and the beginning of political dialogue . \nA spokesman said he had received a response from Mr Assad but had questions about it and `` and was seeking answers '' . \nSyrian foreign ministry spokesman Jihad al-Maqdisi told the BBC that Mr Assad 's response had been positive because he wanted Mr Annan 's mission to succeed . \nBahrain added further pressure , announcing on Thursday it was closing its embassy in Damascus and withdrawing all staff from Syria because of deteriorating conditions . \nA number of countries , including the US , UK , Saudi Arabia , Netherlands and Italy have already closed or suspended their embassies . \nThe UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 20 people , including seven army defectors , were killed on Wednesday as the government began shelling Deraa . \nA day before , opposition activists said government forces had taken control of the north-western city of Idlib , after days of clashes with rebel fighters . \nSecurity forces were reportedly carrying out house-to-house searches in the area , which has been a stronghold of the Free Syrian Army -LRB- FSA -RRB- , the main armed rebel group . \nTom Porteous of Human Rights Watch said there were reports that 114 people had died in the Idlib in the past four days . \nFootage showing the scale of protests in Syria started emerging in March last year Reports are difficult to verify because of tight restrictions on independent media operating in Syria . \nThe violence comes two weeks after troops backed by tanks entered the shattered Baba Amr district of Homs , which had been under bombardment for almost a month , leaving an estimated 700 people dead . \nFrench foreign minister Alain Juppe insisted that the answer to crisis was not to arm the opposition . \n`` If we give arms to a certain faction of the Syrian opposition , we will create the conditions for a civil war ... and that could become an even bigger catastrophe than we have now , '' he said . \nThe first protest in Syria took place on the streets of Damascus , on 15 March 2011 , amid the wave of political unrest across the Middle East and North Africa . \nA few days later , there were clashes in Deraa , as crowds protested against the arrest and alleged torture of a group of schoolchildren who had written anti-government slogans on a wall . \nThe army was called into Deraa to restore order by the end of the month , but the unrest had already spread to towns and cities across the country . \nAs the army began firing on civilians , the initial calls for more political freedom escalated into calls for the removal of Mr Assad and his government . \nThe Syrian government has been trying to suppress an uprising inspired by events in Tunisia , Egypt and Libya . \nThe UN says thousands have been killed in the crackdown , and that many more have been detained and displaced . \nThe Syrian government says hundreds of security forces personnel have also died combating `` armed terrorist gangs '' . \nThe family of President Bashar al-Assad has been in power since his father , Hafez , took over in a coup in 1970 . \nThe country underwent some liberalisation after Bashar became president in 2000 , but the pace of change soon slowed , if not reversed . \nCritics are imprisoned , domestic media are tightly controlled , and economic policies often benefit the elite . \nThe country 's human rights record is among the worst in the world . \nSyria is a country of 21 million people with a Sunni Muslim majority -LRB- 74 % -RRB- and significant minorities of Alawites - the Shia heterodox sect to which Mr Assad belongs - and Christians . \nMr Assad promotes a secular identity for the country , but he has concentrated power in the hands of family and other Alawites . \nProtests have generally been biggest in Sunni-dominated areas . \nUnder the sanctions imposed by the Arab League , US and EU , Syria 's two most vital sectors , tourism and oil , have ground to a halt in recent months . \nThe IMF says Syria 's economy contracted by 2 % in 2011 , while the value of the Syrian pound has crashed . \nUnemployment is high , electricity cuts trouble Damascus , and critical products like heating oil and staples like milk powder are becoming scarce . \nPro-democracy protests erupted in March 2011 after the arrest and torture of a group of teenagers who had painted revolutionary slogans on walls at their school in the southern city of Deraa . \nSecurity forces opened fire during a march against the arrests , killing four . \nThe next day , the authorities shot at mourners at the victims ' funerals , killing another person . \nPeople began demanding the overthrow of Mr Assad . \nThe government has tried to deal with the situation with a combination of minor concessions and force . \nPresident Assad ended the 48-year-long state of emergency and introduced a new constitution offering multi-party elections . \nBut at the same time , the authorities have continued to use violence against unarmed protesters , and some cities , like Homs , have suffered weeks of intense bombardment . \nThe opposition is deeply divided . \nSeveral groups formed a coalition , the Syrian National Council -LRB- SNC -RRB- , but it is dominated by the Sunni community and exiled dissidents . \nThe SNC disagrees with the National Co-ordination Committee -LRB- NCC -RRB- on the questions of talks with the government and foreign intervention , and has found it difficult to work with the Free Syrian Army - army defectors seeking to topple Mr Assad by force . \nInternational pressure on the Syrian government has been intensifying . \nIt has been suspended from the Arab League , while the EU and the US have imposed sanctions . \nHowever , there has been no agreement on a UN Security Council resolution calling for an end to violence . \nAlthough military intervention has been ruled out by Western nations , there are increasing calls to arm the opposition . \nCorrespondents say a peaceful solution seems unlikely . \nSyria 's leadership seems intent on crushing resistance and most of the opposition will only accept an end to the regime . \nSome believe the expected collapse of Syria 's currency and an inability to pay salaries may be the leadership 's downfall . \nThere are fears , though , that the resulting chaos would be long-lasting and create a wider conflict . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}

'' \nBack in April , Mr Fabius 's predecessor as France 's foreign minister , Alain Juppe , warned that if the Annan plan failed then the UN would `` have to move to a new stage '' involving enforcement . \nUnder the Annan plan , all armed violence has to end and all parties must ensure provision of humanitarian assistance to all areas affected by the fighting . \nThe authorities are also required to ensure freedom of movement for journalists and the right for people to demonstrate peacefully . \nPermits UN Security Council to take action - military and non-military - if it determines `` any threat to the peace , breach of the peace or act of aggression '' exists Armed action can be taken if the council finds non-military steps would be , or have proved to be , inadequate Measures can include air , sea and land operations Action can be vetoed by any of the permanent Security Council members - US , Russia , France , Britain and China All UN members required to assist any armed action approved Armed action would be directed by UN Military Staff Committee , composed of permanent Security Council members ' armed forces chiefs Mr Fabius said the Annan plan would now have to be enforced `` under pain of very heavy sanctions '' . \nHe said he would get in touch immediately with his European and American colleagues to propose a raft of new , `` tougher '' measures that would hit not only Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad but also `` army officials and all those who support Assad '' . \nRussia and China both have a veto at the UN Security Council and have already blocked two resolutions calling for tougher action against Damascus . \nEarlier on Wednesday , Syrian forces seized control of the western mountain town of Haffa after fierce fighting with rebels . \nState media said Haffa had been `` purged of terrorists '' and government forces had `` restored security and calm to the area '' . \nThe rebel Free Syrian Army said it had pulled its fighters out of the area to spare residents from further massive bombardments . \nSyrian activists said at least 40 people were killed by security forces across the country on Wednesday . \nAt least 12 people , most of them women and children , died in attacks by helicopters and artillery on the rebel-held town of Rastan , north of Homs , activists reported . \nThe government said it had buried 27 military personnel killed in the conflict . \nUN observers were turned away from Haffa by pro-regime villagers As diplomatic moves over Syria intensify , the Russian foreign minister is due to meet British Foreign Secretary William Hague in the Afghan capital , Kabul , on Thursday . \nAsked by reporters whether he felt Syria had descended into civil war , Mr Hague said : `` I continue to put it the same way as the last few days , that Syria is on the edge of collapse or of a deadly sectarian civil war .

{"id": "78", "time": "2012-06-13", "text": "The BBC 's Middle East bureau editor Paul Danahar recently visited Syria , where he saw a population living in a state of fear and suspicion . \nHere he explains the dimensions to the conflict and why a solution is proving elusive . \nThe world spent too long looking at the Syrian conflict through the prism of the other Arab uprisings . \nThe regime was just another domino waiting to fall and that is how the world saw the crisis , in black and white . \nBut as the conflict became more complex it dissolved into shades of gray . \nThere was still the army and the protesters but there were new elements too . \nThe scale of the uprising and the size of the country has stretched the regime because it only trusts its most loyal brigades to tackle the serious flare-ups . \nThey fear defections will occur if they ask ordinary units to open fire on civilians . \nThere are not enough of these elite units to put out fires and then hold ground . \nSo the government created militias , or shabiha , for that task . \nThey told the Alawite community , from which most of the leadership is drawn : `` This is not a Syrian revolution , it is a Sunni revolution , so get on the right side . '' \nThey gave militias guns and they told them to protect themselves . \nMost people I met in Syria believed that while the shabiha work hand in hand with the army to attack the opposition held areas , they are also working alone to carrying out sectarian murders or settle local feuds . \nSome of these militias decided the best protection is the pre-emptive murder of the community next door . \nIt is not even simple on the opposition side . \nFrustrated by the willingness of the regime to shoot unarmed people and the world 's reluctance to intervene to stop them some elements of the opposition began a military fight back . \nIn some cases they found that the help they started to get from outside came with strings attached . \nThat has led , diplomats told me , to on at least one occasion other regional countries using their command and control of some opposition military units to wreck local ceasefires negotiated by the UN . \nIt is because of this kind of incident that Kofi Annan wants to widen the group of people dealing with a resolution of the conflict . \nMuch of what the Syrian government said may not have been true but some of it now is . \nIn some cases it has been a self-fulfilling prophesy . \nLarge-scale killings , like in Qubair , are believed to be the work of shadowy militias Some Islamic extremists are now in Syria and they have come with the experience of fighting in Iraq under their belt . \nThey have no real masters . \nIf you are not one of them you are against them and you are target . \nDamascus was until recent months fairly detached from this violence . \nNow it is a city constantly on edge . \nThe major bomb attacks in the urban centres scared some of the minorities and the people in the middle ground towards the government fearing the rise of jihadi groups . \nThe rise of the militias has scared them back towards the opposition fearing a sectarian civil war . \nEven those people once close to the regime are now nervous about falling foul of the security services . \nEveryone is scared of a knock on the door . \nMuch of what the activists have said may have been true but some of it is not . \nOne diplomat told me : `` This is also a propaganda war - you ca n't take anyone at face value now . '' \nThat is why the role of the UN is so crucial because despite the shortcomings of its present brief the world needs a neutral eye on this conflict . \nIn Libya last year a UN resolution was drawn up almost entirely based on the `` eyewitness '' reports that the government was bombing the population from the air . \nThe claim was wrong and it helped create bad blood between the members of the UN security council . \nSyria is paying the price for that now . \nThe UN mission on the ground has carried out a dangerous job but the status quo is quietly accepted as pointless . \nAny extension of their mission must include changes to the scope and size of their operation . \nSome in Syria think Bashar al-Assad has not been tough enough Some embassies closed for security reasons . \nSome closed because of pressure at home for a gesture , to be seen to `` do something '' . \nMany activists in Damascus told me this was short-sighted because they now have no-one to talk to . \nThose governments also now rely on second-hand information to shape policy . \nThe so-called `` Yemeni Solution '' is a case in point . \nSo many diplomats I spoke to in the weeks and months before I went into Syria thought this was the solution to the problem - replace the president and hand power to the lower downs and the problem would be solved . \nThen you hear that one of the chants among pro-regime supporters in Damascus is : `` Send Bashar to the clinic and Maher to the leadership '' - a call for the president 's brother to take over because some in the regime think the boss is too soft . \nReplacing the top tier of the regime might look neat on paper , but some of the people lower down are actually doing the killing , not just issuing the orders . \nDoes the world really want them in charge ? \nFinally any solution must deal with the very real fears of the minority communities , and most particularly the Alawites . \nPerhaps 30 % of the Alawite community is relatively wealthy . \nThe rest live in slums and survive only because of their government jobs . \nThey dominate the bureaucracy yet they make up only 12 % of the country . \nIf the revolution is about justice , then justice means kicking many of these people out of their jobs . \nThe world tried `` de-Baathification '' in Iraq and it was a disaster . \nAs uncomfortable as it may be , if the fabric of this society is to be held together , `` justice '' might have to wait a few years . \nThat suggestion provokes howls of protest from some in the opposition when it is mentioned . \nBut trying to shut down the debate by crying `` stooge '' will stop dialogue and that will cost lives . \nThe minorities need to believe they will have a future in a new Syria . \nThe opposition has to unify and offer these people a reason to put down their guns not convince them that they are in a fight to the death . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}

{"id": "48", "time": "2012-06-13", "text": "How Russian and Chinese media justify Syrian support As Russia and China remain steadfast in their refusal to back UN resolutions condemning President Bashar al-Assad , the BBC news website looks at media coverage of the Syria conflict in both countries and whether broadcasters tend to justify this stance . \nMost Russians get their information about the wider world from three dominant TV channels - Rossiya 1 , Channel One and NTV , which are controlled by the state and generally serve the interests of the Kremlin . \nRussian television suggests that Syria 's government is battling a violent insurgency Between them , these channels get around 50 % of the total TV audience . \nTheir share of the TV news audience is significantly higher . \nFor most of the current crisis in Syria , Russian TV has suggested that President Assad is facing a violent insurgency that has allowed Islamic terrorists and various criminal elements to wreak havoc in the country . \nThey frequently refer to the armed opposition in very negative terms , such as `` bandits '' , `` terrorists '' and `` armed gangs '' and they lay the blame for most of the violence at their door . \nGovernment forces are largely exonerated , and there is little or no mention of the Shabiha militias widely blamed in the Western media for carrying out atrocities . \nThe reporting of the massacre in Houla on 25 May was no exception . \nWhile early reports of the killings were headline news in most Western media , Russian TV initially tried to play them down . \nCorrespondents from Russia 's main TV channels go into the country with the blessing of the Syrian government , and do not run the same risks '' Later , it suggested that the deaths had been an `` act of provocation '' designed to discredit the Assad regime in the eyes of the world and pave the way for Western military intervention . \nA report on official channel Rossiya 1 on 28 May also questioned the West 's reaction to the massacre , suggesting that both Western media and diplomats were wilfully ignoring the possibility that anti-Assad forces -LRB- including foreign mercenaries -RRB- had been behind it . \nA regular feature of Russian television 's coverage of the Syrian crisis has been that Western media and the pan-Arab channel Al-Jazeera have been waging an `` information war '' against the Assad regime . \nAs the death of Sunday Times correspondent Marie Colvin showed , most Western journalists reporting from Syria are exposed to considerable personal danger . \nCorrespondents from Russia 's main TV channels , though , go into the country with the blessing of the Syrian government , and do not run the same risks . \nIn the days following the Houla massacre , Vadim Fefilov , a reporter from NTV - owned by gas giant Gazprom - filed a series of dispatches that purported to show how the violence is affecting ordinary Syrians . \nIn Damascus , he spoke to a cafe owner who complained of being `` terrorised '' and said the violence was hitting the economy . \nHe also met a Russian-speaking academic who said his daughter had been kidnapped . \nMr Fefilov also filed a story from Homs , where he filmed a boy in hospital said to have been wounded in an attack on his village by `` bandits '' . \nMr Fefilov said the attack had claimed the lives of 12 of the boy 's fellow villagers . \nIn all these cases , it was the armed opposition or criminal elements who were blamed for the violence . \nThere was no mention of violence from the government side . \nRadio stations and newspapers in Russia present a more balanced picture of the Syrian crisis , with some questioning both wisdom and morality of the Kremlin 's backing for President Assad but these media are not nearly as influential as the main TV stations . \nChina , which has aligned its position on Syria to that of Russia , has been using its state-controlled media to defend its support for President Assad and to criticise Western nations for aggravating the situation and using it to further their own interests . \nSome Chinese papers have suggested anti-Assad forces were behind the Houla massacre Chinese officials and media have expressed concerns over the increasing violence and humanitarian crisis in Syria , but they stress that the international community should not assume that the Syrian government is behind the violence . \nBeijing condemned the Houla massacre , but used the official media to dispute Western allegations of the involvement of pro-government forces . \nThe People 's Daily , the Communist Party 's main mouthpiece , suggested that anti-Assad forces were more likely to have committed the atrocity than the Syrian government . \nAn article published on 31 May in the paper 's overseas edition said that the Syrian authorities were `` the least '' likely to be behind the killings , because it was not in their interest to provide the international community with an excuse to intervene . \n`` Those forces which want to destabilise Syria so that they can fish in troubled waters are more likely to have been behind such incidents , '' the article said . \nThe paper accused some Western countries of `` politicising '' the Houla incident and using it as an excuse to `` suppress the Syrian government '' . \nThe official line dominates the heavily censored Chinese media , but many people have voiced different views on China 's increasingly dynamic internet . \nSome have criticised the Chinese government for siding with a dictator who massacres his own people , while others have questioned the wisdom of antagonising the international community , including much of the Arab world , over a country in which China does not have a big stake . \nThe Global Times , a nationalist tabloid run by the People 's Daily , has defended Beijing 's stance against domestic criticisms . \nIn an article published on 11 June , the paper said that `` China can not abandon the principle of opposing military intervention '' even though Mr Assad may eventually be toppled . \n`` Even if Assad leaves power , China wo n't be embarrassed for sticking to this principle , '' the paper said . \nWriting in the Global Times on 12 June , Shen Yi , a scholar at Fudan University , stressed that domestic public opinion should not be allowed to interfere with China 's policy on Syria . \nAccording to Shen , China should guard against such domestic interference because `` foreign policy should serve the long-term national interest '' . \n"}
{"id": "268", "time": "2012-02-24", "text": "By Jonathan Marcus BBC Defense and Diplomatic Correspondent , in Tunis Syrian opposition protesters clashed with police outside the talks in Tunis Urgency but also frustration marked this inaugural gathering of the Friends of Syria grouping . \nUrgency because of the worsening situation on the ground - but frustration because even the participants knew than none of the measures discussed at the Tunis meeting are likely to bring about the fall of the regime of Bashar al-Assad anytime soon . \nRumour has it that the Saudi Foreign Minister , Prince Saud al-Faisal , walked out early in frustration at the limited ambitions for this meeting . \nOr did he , as his officials say , have to go to a bilateral meeting ? \nIt is clear the Saudis do feel unhappy with the pace of developments and the kind of consensus-driven diplomacy that dominates these kinds of events . \nIn a meeting with US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , Prince Saud al-Faisal was asked if he thought arming the Syrian opposition was a good idea . \n`` I think it 's an excellent idea , '' he replied , suggesting that direction in which his country 's stance may be heading . \nI asked one prominent Western minister if he thought that certain Gulf countries might already be funding or delivering arms supplies to the Syrian opposition . \nHis answer was non-committal - accompanied by a smile and a wink - suggesting perhaps that this assertion was not too far from the truth . \nFor now it is events on the ground that are set to determine Syria 's fate , not diplomatic maneuvers beyond its borders '' So what was achieved here in Tunis ? \nThe main Syrian opposition group - the Syrian National Council - received a boost to its standing . \nIt is now to be seen by Western and Arab League governments as a legitimate representative of the Syrian people . \nNot `` the '' legitimate representative - it is not yet a government-in-waiting . \nThe hope is that it will step up its efforts to appeal to all sectors of Syrian society and that other groups will coalesce around it to form a much more representative body . \nIn truth though , diplomats have to deal with the opposition they have , not the one they would like . \nThere was also agreement to step up preparations to get humanitarian aid into cities like Homs . \nThe US and others are putting up money . \nBut this all depends upon the Syrian authorities granting humanitarian access . \nThe small-scale evacuation of casualties from Homs by the International Committee of the Red Cross -LRB- ICRC -RRB- and the Syrian Red Crescent Society is a small positive step , but nobody knows if it will lead to similar humanitarian opportunities . \nThe reinforcement of economic and diplomatic sanctions was discussed too , but as British Foreign Secretary William Hague admitted , their effect would be cumulative over time rather than immediate . \nHillary Clinton launched a stinging attack on Russia and China There were , however , some diplomatic fireworks . \nSpeaking at the end of the meeting , Mrs Clinton launched a stinging attack against Russia and China for their behavior in blocking a Syria resolution at the UN Security Council . \nIndeed Moscow came in for additional scorn for continuing to arm the Syrian military . \nThere is no disguising the dismay and some anger here , especially at Russia 's position , though the condemnation directed at Moscow could be counter-productive . \nIndeed , if there is to be any kind of transition in Syria - short of the wholesale collapse of the regime - Russian diplomacy , given its close friendship with the Assad family over the years , could be an asset . \nSo the success or failure of this meeting really depends upon how you view it . \nIn diplomatic terms there were some modest achievements . \nNew mechanisms have been put in place to keep the Syrian crisis at the forefront of the international agenda . \nFormer UN Secretary General Kofi Annan has been appointed as the joint UN and Arab League Special Envoy for Syria . \nAnd the Friends of Syria group is set to meet again soon - first in Turkey and then in France . \nIt looks like preparations for the long haul . \nViewed perhaps from the perspective of some of the key actors in the region and especially from the Syrian opposition 's point of view , this meeting fell way short . \nIt did little to change one fundamental fact . \nFor now it is events on the ground that are set to determine Syria 's fate , not diplomatic maneuvers beyond its borders . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}
{"id": "289", "time": "2012-02-24", "text": "China 's outspoken opposition to international action on Syria is not easy to explain In Tunisia , representatives of 70 nations are trying to find ways to pressure Syria into accepting a ceasefire , to allow humanitarian access , and to show support for Syria 's opposition . \nBut it 's in Beijing and Moscow , far away , where the power to end Syria 's bloodshed really lies . \nSo far China and Russia have provided the diplomatic support that has shielded Syria from international pressure . \nSome say their actions have emboldened the regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria to believe it can act with impunity . \nThey are the two major powers that have blocked efforts in the UN Security Council and the Arab League to force Syria to halt its military offensive against its own people . \nThey have vetoed UN resolutions and stalled efforts to condemn the actions of the Assad regime . \nRussia has clear interests in Syria . \nIt has long given military and diplomatic support to the Syrian government . \nIt supplies Syria with many of its guns , tanks and shells . \nIf the Assad regime fell Russia would lose much of its influence in the Middle East . \nMuch harder to explain is why China has taken the same line , and why it continues to stand so firmly against tougher action over Syria . \nChina does not have direct interests at stake in Syria in the same way that Russia does . \nIt does not sell Syria many weapons or rely on it as an ally . \nIn fact , standing up now puts China in an uncharacteristically exposed position . \nChina 's diplomacy is usually about keeping a low profile and leaving others to take the lead . \nSo what is China 's motivation ? \nThere are many theories . \nFirst is the explanation that China itself gives , publicly at least , that it has a long-standing policy of non-intervention and is sticking to that . \nBut this is not easy to square with the fact that China actively decided to veto the UN resolutions . \nIt did n't need to use its blocking power . \nRussia seemed set to frustrate action at the UN anyway . \nChina could have left Russia to veto action , and allowed the resolution to fail without sticking its own neck out . \nSecond is the explanation that this is a sign of China 's growing assertiveness - that China is starting to stand up for what it believes in . \nThe tension over the issue of Syria becomes more strained as Syrian army action intensifies But China 's veto has left Beijing open to criticism that it sides with dictators and repressive regimes and is encouraging Syria 's crackdown . \nSo this would be an odd issue to choose to make a stand over . \nThird is the idea that China and Russia were outraged by what happened in Libya - where they allowed a UN resolution imposing a no-fly zone but then saw it used by Western powers to bring down the Gaddafi regime - and do n't want a repeat of that experience . \nBut this also does n't stand up to much scrutiny . \nChina 's diplomats at the UN are said to be some of its best . \nThe idea they were blindsided and failed to realize that the UN resolution would bring Gaddafi under enormous pressure makes them look foolish and hardly seems credible . \nEven if it were true , it does not explain why China has blocked new UN resolutions that explicitly do not allow for intervention . \nFourth is the possibility that China is worried that radical Islamic groups are backing the uprising in Syria . \nBeijing may be concerned that their influence could end up spreading down the old Silk Road to China 's own Muslim populations in Xinjiang . \nThis is certainly a concern for China but probably not enough to shape its whole policy towards Syria . \nFifth , and plausible , is the fact that China along with Russia , both authoritarian states themselves , are concerned about the way repressive regimes have been falling in the Arab Spring . \nBoth Beijing and Moscow have shown they are concerned about the ripples from the Middle East , and both believe the UN Security Council has been used to help topple regimes the West does not like . \nSo backing Syria may be a way of trying to stop the dominoes falling . \nThe weakness with this argument is that the Assad regime may be doomed already . \nWhen the man expected to be China 's next president , Xi Jinping , was in Washington this month , the Obama administration told him that China risks being on the wrong side of history over Syria . \nChina could see its standing in the Middle East badly damaged . \nChina 's stance has already left it quite isolated . \nIn the UN General Assembly this month , 137 nations voted to back the Arab League 's plan to end the Syrian crisis , while only 12 nations , including China , opposed it . \nArab nations have implored China to back them but it has declined to . \nSo the final explanation is that Beijing is acting alongside Moscow as a deliberate choice , building a coalition of interests . \nRussia , with its bigger stake in Syria , may have sought China 's help . \nChina may have calculated that to abstain in the UN would have left it open to criticism anyway , and it is better to take an active position alongside Russia . \nChina may now be in a position to ask Russia to return the favor at a later date , perhaps over North Korea . \nBeijing 's Global Times newspaper , linked to the ruling Communist Party , said in Friday 's editorial : `` What 's important is that China co-ordinates well and maintains a tacit understanding with Russia on this issue . \n`` The issue of Syria has so far added points to the quality of strategic co-operation between China and Russia , and this should be seen as China 's achievement in a difficult environment . '' \nCivilians are continuing to die in Syria in their dozens . \nTo say that China 's achievement has been building closer ties with Russia implies that China 's diplomacy is not at all about principles and protecting civilians in a far-off nation , but about hard-headed self interest . \nIf that 's true , do n't expect China to change course over Syria any time soon . \nWho is the anonymous `` super fan '' who appears to have intimate access to , and candid photos of , new leader Xi Jinping ? \nSign in with your BBC iD , or Register to comment and rate comments All posts are reactively-moderated and must obey the house rules . \n24th February 2012 - 16:48 There is a more likely reason . \nChina knows that Iran will be next after the fall of Syria and does not want that . \nIt is your call why . \n24th February 2012 - 16:51 Or maybe China really does n't think Assad is doing anything wrong . \nAfter all , they have and would react to any uprising against their authority in exactly the same way . \n24th February 2012 - 16:57 China is a controlling and evil sleeping giant that is beginning to awake . \nIt shot and ran over its own students with its own tanks in Tiananmen square . \nWe should not be gullible enough to think that we as non - Chinese we will be given any less consideration ? . \nChina is economically raping every county in the modernized world of its manufacturing jobs , while undervaluing it 's dollar and protecting its own jobs . \nThe rules China plays by are most decidedly in their favor . \nWe need to start playing by their own rules to survive , before China 's economic and military influence dominates the planet . \n24th February 2012 - 17:06 China s non-interventionist policy should in fact be commended , not criticised . \nWhat I like about it is the fact that is amazingly consistent . \nThat s contrary to America s way of doing things . \nOne day it OK to invade Iraq and intervene in Libya , which is now heading into chaos . \nBUT it is not OK to intervene in Israel\\/Saudi Arabia or Bahrain when their Arab Spring was brutally crushed . \nAmerica is the biggest bully on the planet . \n24th February 2012 - 17:21 China do n't need Assad , what China needs is a regime that is not controlled by the west or looks to the west for support , China is not stupid , Syria and Iran are the back doors to China , so closing all the doors makes a lot of sense . \n"}

controlled by Lebanon 's Shia Hezbollah movement , an ally of the Syrian government - also reported that Syrian security sources had said that `` Syrian air defences shot down a Turkish warplane and hit another in Syrian airspace '' . \nMr Erdogan was also said to have told Turkish reporters on a flight back from Brazil on Friday afternoon that `` the other side '' had expressed regret over the downing of the F-4 , and also that the pilots had been recovered . \nBut in his televised news conference on arrival at Ankara airport , he indicated that the pilots were still missing and he appeared to play down suggestions of an apology . \n`` I can not confirm whether they have apologised or on what grounds they did so if they apologised , '' the Hurriyet website quoted him as saying . \nHe then went into a two-hour emergency meeting with his interior , defense and foreign ministers and the Chief of the General Staff , Gen Necdet Ozel . \nInside Syria , the violence has continued with state media reporting that `` armed terrorist groups '' had abducted and massacred 25 villagers in Aleppo province . \nActivists said that rebels had shot dead 26 government supporters who were believed to be militiamen . \nA video has been posted online , purporting to show the bodies of some of the victims in the village of Darat Izza . \nIn Aleppo city , activists said a number of people died when security forces opened fire on a demonstration after Friday prayers . \nInternational envoy Kofi Annan has said it is time for the world to exert greater pressure to help bring the violence in Syria to an end . \nHe was speaking in Geneva alongside the head of the UN observer mission , Maj-Gen Robert Mood , who suspended patrols in Syria at the weekend because of the risks to the safety of the 300 observers . \nMr Annan called for Iran to be involved in attempts to end the violence , a proposal put forward by Russia but rejected by the US . \nIn a separate development , the BBC has learned that UK government officials have decided to prevent the head of the Syrian Olympic Committee , Gen Mowaffak Joumaa , from traveling to London for the Games . \nThe visa ban is believed to be linked to his relationship to President Bashar al-Assad 's government . \nThe International Olympic Committee is expected to ratify the decision . \n"}

'' \nI was asked from London . \nIn Baba Amr , it certainly felt like one . \nBut we were seeing a battle over one city . \nAnd Homs is not Syria . \nNot yet , perhaps . \nIn Homs , the Sunni areas , such as Baba Amr , largely support the uprising . \nThey were being shelled by the Syrian army , from the Alawite and Christian areas , which largely support the regime . \nThere are Sunnis in the security forces ; Christians and Alawites have joined the revolution . \nIt is not yet a purely sectarian conflict . \nBut the pressures for it to become one are enormous . \nYousseff Hannah was a prisoner of the Free Syrian Army -LRB- FSA -RRB- - the rebel fighters who have defected from government forces . \nHe was on a mattress , his thigh bandaged , in the basement of a house near the town of Qusayr , about 25 miles -LRB- 40km -RRB- from Homs . \n`` Law and order , '' he told me , groaning from his wound , in reply to my question about his job . \nOne of his captors angrily interrupted : `` No. . \nYou are mukhabarat -LRB- secret police -RRB- . \nTell them you are mukhabarat . '' \nThe FSA had snatched him a few days before from his home . \nHe had been recovering there from the leg wound , received in Homs . \nFSA fighters showed me a film taken from the mobile phone of a captured Shabiha . \nPrisoners lay face down on the ground , hands tied behind their backs . \nOne-by-one , their heads were cut off '' Aged 45 , he was only a corporal , hardly a big fish . \nThe rebels said they had taken him because his family had their own checkpoint in Qusayr that was harassing people . \nThey wanted it to stop . \nFor too long , they said , people like him - protected by the regime - had felt they were untouchable , able to act with impunity . \nCpl Yousseff was a Christian . \nAfter he was taken , his relatives kidnapped six Sunnis , killing one in the process . \nIn return , around 20 Christians were abducted . \n`` Some hotheads have been kidnapping Christians , '' one of the senior FSA commanders in the area told me . \n`` We have got to calm this down . '' \nAfter several days of stalemate , everyone was released , unharmed , including Corporal Yousseff . \nThis was done as part of a deal for him and his family to leave Qusayr permanently . \nDiscussing the past tense few days , one of the Christian residents told me that Qusayr still had Christians who supported the uprising . \nFSA fighters were trained and disciplined during the attack - but eventually had to retreat About a dozen attended the big Friday protest . \nIn solidarity with them , the entire demonstration walked off when some at the front grabbed the microphone and started shouting Salafi -LRB- Islamist -RRB- slogans . \nEveryone felt the town had come close to tipping over into serious sectarian bloodletting that week . \nIs that the future for Syria ? \nMuch depends on the character of the FSA . \nAll of the fighters we met were Sunni . \nPerhaps that does not matter . \nThe commander near Qusayr told me they were fighting for all of Syria 's religions and sects : Christian , Muslim , Alawite , Sunni , Druze , Shia . \n`` We are experiencing freedom for the first time , '' said Maj Ahmad Yaya . \nBut his next words left no doubt , either , that for many , this is a religious - and Islamic - struggle against the secular Baath regime . \n`` For the first time , '' he went on , `` we are able to proclaim the word of God throughout this land . '' \nHomes in Baba Amr have been badly damaged by shelling The official doctrine of the FSA is that it is there only to protect the unarmed demonstrators . \nIn practice , the FSA is waging an escalating guerrilla war . \nWe followed Maj Yaya 's group of fighters as they attacked an army base near the town . \nThe attack was big , more than 60 men . \nIn contrast to the fighters in Libya , they were trained , disciplined and followed a plan . \nOne man said his brother was still serving in the area . \n`` What if he was in the base ? \nWhat if he was killed ? '' \n`` I feel very bitter about my brother but what happens is in God 's hands now . \nMay God help me , '' he replied . \nInevitably , they failed . \nAfter an hour of firing on the base they had to flee when the government troops started using heavy weapons , dropping mortar shells on the hill . \nAfterwards , one of the FSA fighters showed me a video he had filmed in December . \nThey had ambushed a convoy of armored vehicles . \nEight of the security forces were killed , 11 captured . \nThe video showed the prisoners , in camouflage uniform , lined up facing a wall . \nPresident Bashar al-Assad says his army is fighting armed gangs Some were still bleeding after the battle . \nTheir arms were raised . \nOne turned to the camera , looking petrified . \nThe man who 'd taken the pictures said that despite their army uniforms , their ID cards showed they were Shabiha -LRB- or ghosts -RRB- - the hated government paramilitary force . \n`` We killed them , '' he told me . \n`` Yes , of course . \nThey were executed later . \nThat is the policy for Shabiha . '' \nThese were Sunni Shabiha , he added ; the only Alawite had escaped . \nI checked with an officer . \nWhile soldiers were released , he said , members of the Shabiha were `` executed '' after a hearing before a panel of FSA military judges . \nTo explain , they showed me a film taken from the mobile phone of a captured Shabiha . \nPrisoners lay face down on the ground , hands tied behind their backs . \nOne-by-one , their heads were cut off . \nThe man wielding the knife said , tauntingly , to the first : `` This is for freedom . '' \nAs his victim 's neck opened , he went on : `` This is for our martyrs . \nAnd this is for collaborating with Israel . '' \nIn Homs , after we left , there were reports from human rights activists that the Shabiha , going house-to-house , had murdered three families , men , women and children . \nTo most FSA fighters , `` executing '' the Shabiha seems only just . \nSuch things will give Western governments pause as they decide whether , or , increasingly , how to help the FSA . \nWashington and London say they will not arm the rebels but they are thinking about how to assist in other ways . \nThat might include giving advice and sending supplies , perhaps including flak jackets . \nIf they help the rebels , will they fuel a civil war , or worse , a sectarian civil war ? \nIf they do not , how can the killings in Homs , and elsewhere , be stopped ? \nThe longer this continues , the more bodies pile up , the greater the desire for revenge on both sides . \nCivil war is not inevitable . \nBut Homs today could be Syria tomorrow . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}

'' \nMr Abdah added : `` The main problem is not the constitution , but the fact that the state has complete control over the army and security forces . \nAs long as you keep that , everything else is just empty promises . '' \n`` The proposed constitution does not tackle that in any way or form . \nIt is working towards keeping the current regime in place . '' \nIn a separate development , the SNC re-elected Burhan Ghalioun as its head at a meeting in the Qatari capital Doha . \nEarlier on Wednesday , activists said troops had begun shelling the nearby city of Hama . \nSeveral people had been injured by rocket and mortar fire in the districts of Arbain , Amiriya , Faraiya , Elilat , Bashura and Bab Qibli , and all telecommunications had been cut , they added . \nDuring the night , activists said the Hamidiyya district came under a constant hail of gunfire . \nThey said that for the first time , multiple rocket launchers were seen being taken through the city towards the embattled quarter , where fighters from the rebel Free Syrian Army , a group of army defectors , were believed to be entrenched . \nThe government has said little about the latest clashes , but state media reported that security forces had seized large quantities of weapons . \nIn a separate development , France 's foreign minister said it had started negotiating a new UN Security Council resolution on Syria with Russia . \n`` We are renegotiating a resolution at the UN Security Council to persuade the Russians , '' Alain Juppe told France Info radio . \nHe also said France wanted to discuss creating `` humanitarian corridors '' in Syria to `` reach the zones where there are scandalous massacres '' . \n"}

{"id": "91", "time": "2012-06-24", "text": "By Jonathan Marcus BBC diplomatic correspondent Turkey is still searching for the missing plane Turkey 's decision to call a Nato meeting to discuss the downing of one of its warplanes by Syrian air defences is a measure of the seriousness of the current situation but it also sends a signal that , for now at least , Ankara is looking for a concerted diplomatic response rather than taking military action of its own . \nAt the very least the downing of the Turkish jet risks a dangerous new twist in the Syrian crisis . \nSince the start of the unrest , concern at the escalating loss of life inside Syria has been coupled with fears that the violence could move beyond Syria 's own borders prompting a broader regional conflagration . \nThe violence has already seeped into Lebanon but the greater fear was that if the fighting spilled over the border , say into Turkey , or if somehow Hezbollah were to be encouraged by the Syrian regime to lash out at Israel , then this could become an inter-state conflict rather than an insurgency largely confined within the borders of one country . \nThe episode of the downing of the jet still raises many questions . \nWhere exactly was it when it was engaged by Syrian air defences ? \nWhy had it strayed into Syrian air-space for at least a small part of its flight ? \nWhy were measures not taken to alert the aircraft 's crew of their error before knocking the plane out of the sky ? \nWas this just a routine training mission as the Turks say , or was the aircraft seeking to monitor what was going on the ground ? \nWhat 's clear is that Turkey 's concern is shared by other Nato countries . \nBritain 's Foreign Secretary William Hague has expressed his grave concern at the shooting down of the aircraft , which he says , according to the Turkish authorities , had happened `` without warning '' . \nTurkey has now determined to take the matter to Nato , calling for an urgent meeting to discuss the situation . \nArticle 4 of the Nato Treaty allows for countries to consult together whenever `` the territorial integrity , political independence or security of any of the Parties is threatened '' . \nTurkey might have sought such consultations at earlier stages in this crisis , prompted for example by the flood of refugees across its borders or shelling from Syria into its territory . \nFor now at least Turkey is not seeking to invoke Article 5 of the Nato treaty which would require countries to offer it practical military assistance . \nThis is what happened after Iraq 's invasion of Kuwait when Saddam Hussein threatened Turkey . \nNato warplanes and air defences were , reluctantly it must be said , despatched to bolster its air defences . \nMany will wonder if this episode brings the likelihood of direct external military intervention in Syria any closer . \nThe answer is probably no. . \nThe situation on the ground is complex and messy and few countries have much appetite to become involved . \nIn addition the shooting down of the Turkish jet is a reminder of the capabilities of Syria 's air defences which are far more extensive than those of Libya , which still required a full-scale US air campaign to destroy . \nBut what this episode does do is to highlight the escalating dangers as the Syrian crisis continues . \nAs the bloodshed grows and the Assad regime becomes more desperate , so the risk of some untoward event happening which widens the circle of conflict grows accordingly . \nNato 's deliberations will raise the pressure on the Syrian regime but it is hard to see them having any practical effect in terms of convincing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to relinquish power . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}

{"id": "301", "time": "2012-02-13", "text": "13 February 12 09:54 GMT The situation in Syria has never looked bleaker nor closer to civil war . \nAlmost a year after the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad 's government began , Syrian security forces have stepped up military operations to crush the opposition movement in key cities and towns . \nIn Homs , the center of the revolution , the security forces are now using heavy weapons including artillery , rockets and mortars to bombard residential areas . \nThe result : in less than a fortnight , more than 400 people have been killed , including women and many children , according to opposition activists . \nThe BBC 'S Paul Wood , who witnessed the onslaught at first hand , has returned with stories of extraordinary brutality . \nHe was shown a video taken from the phone of a member of the feared government paramilitary force , the Shabiha . \nIn the video , prisoners are systematically beheaded as they lie on the ground with their hands tied behind their backs . \nIn response , rebel fighters say if they catch members of the Shabiha , they kill them . \nMeanwhile , the hand-wringing continues within the international community . \nThe latest Arab League proposal for a joint UN-Arab peacekeeping mission for Syria is more a mark of desperation about what to do than an idea that could be implemented in the current circumstances . \nAlready foreign military intervention has been ruled out partly because of concerns about the impact on the wider region , while diplomatic action in the UN Security Council is being blocked by Russia and China . \nAnd although officials say the situation in Syria is a `` human tragedy on a large scale '' , the idea of setting up humanitarian corridors and no-fly zones has been described by one Western diplomat as `` not realistic '' because they would need to be protected . \nThere is also reluctance among Western countries to start arming and training the Syrian rebels because it might tip Syria into a full-blown civil war . \nBut where Western countries now fear to tread , others seem to be stepping in . \nThe BBC has been told by a well-placed source who did not wish to be named that traditional smuggling routes through Iraq have been used since last autumn to ferry money to rebel fighters inside Syria . \nIt is alleged the money is coming from Saudi Arabia , after members of the Shammar tribe in eastern Syria who have joined the uprising against President Assad appealed for help from their fellow tribesmen in Saudi Arabia . \nThe smuggling routes pass through the Iraqi provinces of al-Anbar and Nineveh , where the long desert border with Syria is easy to cross . \nIn a recent interview with the AFP news agency , Iraq 's deputy interior minister Adnan al-Assadi confirmed these routes were also being used for smuggling weapons and Iraqi militants who want to fight alongside the Syrian rebels . \n`` The weapons are transported from Baghdad to Nineveh , '' he said . \n`` And the prices of weapons in Mosul -LRB- the province 's capital -RRB- are higher now because they are being sent to the opposition in Syria . '' \nThe movement of militants from Iraq into Syria could increase following the release of a video on Saturday by al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri , in which he called on Muslims across the region to support the Syrian uprising . \nThe Syrian rebels , who are believed to include several distinct groupings , including ordinary people protecting their communities , army defectors and militant Islamists , are also reported to have been buying weapons from Lebanon . \nThis is more difficult than the Iraqi route , but sources say an Islamist group based in northern Lebanon may itself be funnelling some supplies and fighters into Syria . \nBut in reality , the current supply routes through Iraq and Lebanon are extremely unlikely to make much difference on the ground where the rebels face a well-equipped army of more than 200,000 soldiers . \nWhat is not clear at the moment is whether key members of the Arab League will now consider providing weapons and training for the Syrian opposition , having pledged at their meeting in Cairo on Sunday to provide `` all forms of political and material support '' to the opposition . \n"}

'' \nThe presumed , unsaid subtext is : Russia will also make this task as difficult as possible . \nMoscow claims to have a special influence on the regime in Damascus , but it seems that instead of advising Bashar Assad to change his ways , Russian emissaries were telling him until recently - help us to help you . \nUse some creative window dressing and we 'll be able to defend you better . \nThe main goal for Moscow will continue to be a face-saving solution for Mr Assad '' This approach starts to wear thin as UN special envoy Kofi Annan 's mission fails and the Syrian regime 's legitimacy starts to hemorrhage with growing speed . \nThe Kremlin entertains the possibility of Mr Assad 's exit from the game but it still considers this possibility remote . \nIt thinks that with help from Russia , Iran and China , the Syrian leader has a chance of prevailing over his opponents . \nHowever , should the Assad clan be forced to leave , Russia will hope for and work very hard on creating a negotiations framework that would involve external players and possibly give Moscow some scope to bargain over its commercial and military interests in Syria . \nBut the main goal for Moscow will continue to be a face-saving solution for Mr Assad , which at least outwardly will not look like `` regime change '' in its classic form . \nOff the record , Russian officials like to point to the Yemen roundtable talks which eased veteran Ali Abdullah Saleh from the presidential chair , granted him immunity and installed his own vice-president as the head of state . \nBut with the Syrian drama 's tragic turn , such a scenario looks increasingly unlikely . \nWhich may well leave Moscow stuck with the Assad government till the bitter end . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}

'' \nThe UN and the US have warned of an alarming escalation in violence in Haffa , amid reports of a build-up of government forces around the town . \nUN monitors first tried to reach Haffa on Monday but were denied access . \nOn Tuesday , government forces gave them permission to pass through the last checkpoint before the town , but the monitors judged the situation to be `` unsafe '' and turned back , a UN spokeswoman said . \nAs they were leaving , an angry crowd threw stones and metal bars at the UN team before unknown assailants opened fire , the spokeswoman said . \nNone of the observers was hurt . \nThe BBC 's Barbara Plett , at the UN in New York , says UN officials have been speaking this week not only about an intensification of government military operations , including firing from helicopters , but also about a dramatic increase in more sophisticated urban attacks by the opposition . \nHillary Clinton : `` We have confronted the Russians about stopping their continued arms shipments to Syria '' Earlier this month , activists said Syrian government forces killed 108 people in the region of Houla , in Homs province , and 78 people in the village of Qubair , in Hama province . \nSyria blames the violence on foreign-backed armed terrorist gangs . \nThe UN monitors are in Syria to observe the implementation of a peace plan brokered by UN-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan . \nHowever , a ceasefire which was supposed to come into effect on 12 April never took hold . \nMr Annan has called for another international conference on Syria , but no date or list of participants has yet been announced . \nActivists said Syrian forces fired mortars at protesters in the eastern city of Deir al-Zour , killing at least 10 people . \nThey also reported clashes in central Homs province . \nThese claims can not be verified independently as Syria severely restricts journalists ' freedom of movement . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}
{"id": "175", "time": "2012-06-12", "text": "By Jonathan Marcus BBC Diplomatic Correspondent For the moment , that does not seem to be the case . \nIndeed , since the outset of the Syria crisis in March 2011 , there has been little appetite for outside military intervention . \nThis has been based on two assessments . \nFirstly , that this would be no simple military option : the situation on the ground in Syria is in many ways very different from that in , for example , Libya - the opposition is much more divided , the government 's security forces are much stronger , and Syria 's air defences are more effective . \nUS officials are unanimous in arguing that the Assad regime is doomed and can only hang on for a limited time , with or without increased US support for the Syrian opposition '' End Quote Joshua Landis Centre for Middle East Studies , University of Oklahoma Secondly , there has been a view that the implications of toppling President Bashar al-Assad could prompt a much wider wave of instability in the region . \nUnlike Libya , Syria - both politically and geographically - is a central player in the Arab world , and sectarianism and instability there could threaten both Lebanon and Iraq . \nThen , of course , there is the fundamental legal problem . \nConstrained by Russian and Chinese vetoes at the UN Security Council , there is no possibility of getting a resolution to authorise force . \nThat has not always mattered in the past . \nNato troops went into Kosovo , after all , to halt systematic abuses by Serbian forces . \nBut the absence of legal authorisation certainly precludes action when there is little enthusiasm for it in the first place . \nSo what are we to make of calls from senior Republican politicians in the US , like Senator John McCain , urging air strikes against Syrian security forces ? \nJoshua Landis , director of the Centre for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma , says : `` Despite the growing chorus of politicians calling for US leadership in Syria , the Obama administration is adamant that Washington should not take the lead , but follow regional partners , Saudi Arabia and Turkey . '' \nThe Obama administration has so far ruled out military intervention in Syria Mr Landis argues the simple fact is that the Obama administration sees no strong reason to intervene . \n`` US officials are unanimous in arguing that the Assad regime is doomed and can only hang on for a limited time , with or without increased US support for the Syrian opposition . \nI think they are right in this analysis . \n`` This means that the US has no compelling national security interest in jumping into the Syrian civil war that is emerging . \nThe regime 's days are numbered . '' \nMuch of the debate on outside intervention is vague . \nIt confuses and makes false distinctions between the different options and to a large extent glosses over many of the fundamental problems facing them all . \nThe main thrust of any external action would be essentially humanitarian in nature , a response to the growing plight of civilians in Syrian towns and cities who are under bombardment by government forces . \nEfforts could also be made to bring assistance to displaced refugees who have moved towards Syria 's frontiers with Turkey and Lebanon . \nThree related measures are being discussed . \nSuggested first by the then French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe last year , the idea would be to establish short corridors into Syrian territory through which humanitarian supplies could be delivered . \nThe establishment of safe areas within Syrian territory is an idea that has been broached by the Turkish Foreign Minister , Ahmet Davutoglu . \nSuch havens would be in border areas , acting as a place of safety where refugees could gather , be fed and sheltered , and so on . \nOften discussed in relation to both of the above , the suggestion is that Western air power could help ensure the safety of the zones or corridors . \nIn itself , air power would not halt the fighting . \nIt is not the Syrian air force that is primarily involved in offensives on opposition strongholds - although activists say jets and helicopters have been used to carry out reconnaissance and occasionally air strikes - but the government 's ground forces . \nBut a discussion of air power underscores that unless the Syrian authorities agree to allow humanitarian access , any safe zones or corridors would first have to be established by force and then defended by force . \nThe horror of Srebrenica in the Balkans showed what can happen if there is no will to defend a safe zone once created . \nThe key point here is that even the options directed primarily at humanitarian relief require significant military elements too . \nThey involve seizing and holding bits of Syrian territory and a willingness to take on Syrian forces if necessary . \nAir power would be crucial - though Western warplanes would have to contend with Syria 's reasonably sophisticated air defences . \nBoots would almost certainly be needed on the ground too . \nThese are not `` military lite '' options . \nChanging the balance of power These options seek to accelerate the processes already at work in Syria both by strengthening the opposition forces and thus seeking to increase the pressure on the Syrian authorities . \nAgain , a range of strategies is available . \nThe quality and quantity of weaponry going to the opposition seems to have improved in recent weeks Logistical support for armed rebel groups This has probably been under way for some time . \nThe idea is to provide medical supplies and non-lethal equipment such as radios to make the opposition more effective . \nFor some , this is seen as the thin end of the wedge , leading to the arming of rebel forces . \nThis is certainly what happened in Libya . \nThe aim here would be to limit weaponry and munitions going to the Syrian government . \nIn the absence of UN Security Council action , this would rest on shaky legal ground . \nIt might also mean being willing to halt Russian shipping , since it is Moscow that remains the Assad regime 's principle armourer . \nBoth Qatar and Saudi Arabia have voiced their support for arming the opposition forces in Syria . \nThere are strong indications that over recent weeks , the quality and quantity of weaponry going to the Syrian opposition has improved , as has their effectiveness . \nSimon Henderson , senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy , wonders if arming the opposition `` is necessarily the best tactic '' , and getting the Syrian army to flip might be a better way of getting rid of President Assad . \n`` Pressure needs to be put on different division commanders , '' he argues . \n`` The US can no doubt identify the commanders and possibly communicate with them - it did this sort of thing during the invasion of Iraq . '' \nIndeed , there have been persistent reports of the US flying drones over the country to gather evidence of humanitarian abuses . \n`` Of course , '' he notes , the risk is that `` this might only bring about a new military-led regime '' . \nAny attack against Syria would have to be on a much larger scale compared with that seen in Libya When the offensive against Homs was at its height , the US very publicly released satellite photos showing Syrian artillery batteries and rocket launchers attacking the city . \nThere were two messages here - one was that the world was watching and documenting what was happening ; the second was perhaps a potential threat - what can be seen from the air can be hit from the air . \nBut as yet there is simply no appetite in Washington to engage in another military conflict in the Middle East . \nAny attack against Syria would have to be on a much larger scale compared to the military operations launched against Libya . \nIndeed , initial US military assessments suggest that a protracted campaign against Syria 's integrated air defences , due to their location , could lead to serious civilian loss of life . \nFor now , such an operation is simply not on President Barack Obama 's agenda . \nAn active discussion about the merits or pitfalls of intervention is nonetheless being waged in both Arab and Western capitals . \nThe crisis in Syria is so serious and the stakes are so high that nobody wants to rule out any option . \nMuch , of course , depends upon how things develop . \nThere are fears further militarisation of the conflict could lead to prolonged civil war should Mr Assad go A central concern in the debate relates to weapons supplies and their impact , not so much on the struggle between the Assad regime and the opposition , but on the Syria that eventually emerges from this crisis . \n`` There are many divisions among the Syrian opposition , but all the militant groups want to bring down the regime , '' Joshua Landis says . \n`` The divisions will not minimize the impact of outside weapons supplies , but they will inhibit any stable government from replacing the present Syrian Army . '' \nSo could a further militarisation of the conflict lead to prolonged civil war should the Assad regime collapse ? \n`` Yes , '' Mr Landis answers . \n`` The sectarian and ethnic divisions in Syria are a recipe for prolonged struggle as is the case in Iraq , Palestine-Israel , and Lebanon . \n`` Decapitating the Syrian regime , through outside intervention , '' he believes , will provide no guarantee of ending the killing . \n`` On the contrary , it could well accelerate the killing if there is no unified leadership which can assume control of Syria and no militia that can impose some order in the place of the Syrian national army . \nIf the sort of civil war that Iraq experienced breaks out , the killing could well spike . '' \nSteven Heydemann of the United States Institute of Peace shares these concerns , but comes to a rather different conclusion . \n`` The further militarisation of the crisis is inevitable , '' he says . \n`` As the regime escalates its use of force against civilians , the armed opposition will expand , and will come to play an even more central role in the uprising than it has to date . \n`` Arms are flowing into Syria across all of its borders - to varying degrees - and the unwillingness of the West or Turkey to endorse the arming of the opposition will not affect this trend , '' he adds . \n`` The single biggest danger of militarisation '' , he warns , `` is that it empowers and gives legitimacy to the armed opposition and contributes to the marginalisation of the political opposition , which is perceived as ineffective in providing protection to civilians who bear the brunt of regime violence . \n`` Increasingly , it is the men with guns who wield power in areas outside of government control , with very troubling implications for Syria 's future . '' \nThe drivers will be events on the ground inside Syria and the reaction to these events from outside the country . \nSoner Cagaptay , a Turkey specialist also at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy , says that the evolution of Ankara 's approach is a case in point . \n`` Initially , Turkey sought to build UN-led action against President Assad . \nWhen that failed , Turkey turned to the Arab League and Friends of Syria group to build internationally sanctioned policy against Damascus , '' he says . \n`` At the same time , Ankara started to host and coach the Syrian opposition . \nNow , Ankara 's policy is entering a third phase , namely calling for humanitarian access for the civilians . \nThis suggests getting relief to the civilians . \n`` But '' , he adds , `` if that policy , too , fails to end the crackdown , the next step will likely be a move into phase four , namely actively arming the opposition in an effort to create a more robust resistance and protection for civilians against Assad 's crackdown . \n`` The final step in Ankara 's Syria policy , if this measure too fails to deliver a concrete victory , against Assad would be calling for a no-fly zone inside Syria to protect civilians . '' \nThe value of the Syrian pound has plummeted as a result of sanctions by the EU and US That , as discussed above , could be a prelude to some broader outside military intervention . \nBut there is a growing pessimism about what external actors can do . \nSo far , diplomatic efforts have delivered little . \nThe so-called Friends of Syria - perhaps as accurately dubbed `` the enemies of President Assad '' - have had only modest success in encouraging the Syrian opposition to become more united . \nThe plan by Syria special envoy Kofi Annan appears dead in the water . \nAnd proposals for a new diplomatic initiative involving Russia again seem to offer only limited hope of progress . \nPerhaps more encouraging for President Assad 's opponents is the impact of economic sanctions . \nJoshua Landis says sanctions are devastating the Syrian economy and have led to sharp falls in the value of the Syrian pound . \n`` They are encouraging some people to leave the country and others to take up arms . \nIt will not be long before hunger and deprivation begin playing an important role in the disturbances . '' \nFurthermore , Mr Landis says , the sanctions `` are weakening the government 's ability to reassure businessmen that the regime can provide for them '' . \nOver time , this will serve to detach key groups from their support for the regime . \nBut economic sanctions require considerable time to take effect and are a blunt tool ; harming the country 's economy inevitably hurts the ordinary man or woman in the street . \nSo with no immediate answers on either the economic or diplomatic fronts , each new massacre revives the calls for some kind of military action . \nOn one side of the argument , there is the fear that without a clear political framework for Syria 's future , the toppling of President Assad could simply precipitate the country 's fall into bloody chaos . \nThousands more lives could be lost . \nOutside intervention might sweep away the regime , leaving a situation like post-war Iraq , where sectarian violence dominated and Western troops were drawn into a quagmire . \nOthers argue the seeds of this catastrophic future can already be seen . \nAs the violence in Syria increases , so does the risk of the crisis spreading to neighbouring Lebanon and perhaps from there turning into a regional conflagration , maybe drawing in Israel or even Turkey . \nBetter , according to this argument , to act soon to dismantle the Syrian regime before the contagion spreads . \nUnpalatable intervention may be , but it is even worse , in this view , to stand by and watch the slaughter of innocents . \nWhat is clear is that there are no easy options . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}
{"id": "308", "time": "2011-04-26", "text": "By Fawaz Gerges Middle East analyst , LSE Protests have been staged in front of Syrian embassies across the world The Syrian regime has dramatically intensified its crackdown against the protesters in an effort to crush the opposition . \nThe country is now on the brink of all-out war . \nResidents say thousands of heavily armed soldiers , backed by tanks , are swarming the streets of their cities and towns . \nIn Deraa on Sunday , witnesses said that security forces had opened fire in the city , shooting indiscriminately , even though no protests were being held at the time . \nAlready , more than 300 people have been killed in a crackdown across the country , human rights groups say . \nHundreds more have been arrested . \nBut this is only a glimpse of the bloodshed we are likely to witness in Syria . \nUnlike in Tunisia or Egypt there is no daylight between the Assad regime and the Syrian army '' The Baathist regime , facing one of the gravest crises in its 40-year history , has unleashed its security apparatus , including army units , to try to break the will of the opposition . \nIt was a tactic used by former President Hafez al-Assad , father of the current leader , Bashar al-Assad , against opposition forces led by the Muslim Brotherhood in Hama in 1982 . \nSome 10,000 Syrians died as the town was virtually flattened by elite government troops . \nIt is well known that unlike in Tunisia or Egypt there is no daylight between the Assad regime and the Syrian army , particularly the presidential guard , a powerful elite force . \nDespite tentative reports about emerging fissures within some army units , the majority of Syrian special forces come from the minority Alawite sect of President Assad and are the spearhead of his regime . \nThere are many reports of crackdowns around Syria , despite the lifting of an emergency law last week They are in a fight for their own survival , as well as the survival of their community , not just the political leadership . \nWe will not see killings on the same scale as Hama , but it is clear that the regime is prepared to use massive force to crush the protesters . \nThe regime has other supporters - members of the Alawite and other minority groups , including Christians , Druze , and some Sunnis whom the regime has co-opted into the power structure over the years . \nBut the intensity and depth of the social uprising has exposed a major rift between state and society . \nAs more innocent blood is spilled , the divide deepens with devastating repercussions for social harmony and peace . \nEven in Syria , which has one of the most repressive security apparatus in the Arab world , the fear factor has gone . \nTens of thousands of Syrians have challenged the authority of the Syrian government . \nContrary to President Assad 's assertions , this is not a foreign conspiracy . \nIt is an internal uprising that encompasses multiple segments of Syrian society - middle-class professionals , human rights activists , the disadvantaged poor who have been hurt by years of drought and unemployment , and members of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood . \nThey are disillusioned by the fact that , more than decade after he assumed power upon the death of his father , the younger President Assad has not carried out many promised reforms . \nThese include opening up the political system , relaxing the heavy hand of the Mukhabarat -LRB- security services -RRB- and ending the monopoly of the ruling Baath Party on political life . \nUnlike his recent claims , Syria is not immune to the mutating democratic virus sweeping the Middle East . \nThe fact that it has reached Syria speaks volumes about the changing mood and psychology in the Arab world . \nThere is a new Arab citizen who feels empowered and emboldened - and determined to have a say in how their government is run . \nBut we have not yet seen in Syria the massive crowds along the lines of Tunisia , Egypt , Yemen and Libya . \nMany people worry about Syria being plunged into all-out sectarian war , like neighbouring Iraq . \nThey believe that President Assad could still rise up to the challenge and enact real change . \nThe protesters have worked hard to stress a non-sectarian , non-tribal , non-violent agenda . \nAlthough it is too early to know the exact composition of the protesters , a new Syrian identity appears to be emerging , anchored in inclusiveness and ethnic tolerance . \nOn Tuesday , more than 100 Syrian intellectuals who live abroad signed a petition condemning the killings and the brutal measures . \nThe intellectuals include Sunnis , Alawites , Christians , Druze and Kurds . \nThis is a testament to the maturity of Syrian society , despite decades of repression . \nThe response of the international community is important to impress upon the regime a sense of urgency to engage with the opposition and the necessity to resist the use of force against unarmed protesters . \nThe Obama administration has begun drawing up targeted financial sanctions against President Assad and senior members of his inner circle . \nAlthough the Western response is crucial , Syrians themselves will determine what happens in Syria in the next few weeks and months . \nThis is an internal crisis that pits the regime against critical social forces . \nA fierce battle of wills will determine the outcome of this structural crisis . \nFor now , the umbilical cord between the security apparatus and the political leadership has not been cut . \nThis is likely to allow President Assad to weather the storm in the short-term . \nBut in the medium and long term , the uprising could take on a life of its own . \nThe more the killings and bloodshed , the more it will fuel further protests . \nAs more Alawites and other fence-sitters step forward to join the protesters , the security forces will think twice about firing on unarmed civilians . \nThis is what tipped the balance of power in Yemen , where senior army officers defected to the side of the people as the protest movement grew . \nWhen President Ali Abdullah Saleh realized that he could no longer rely on the army , it spelled the beginning of the end . \nThe Syrian crisis will simmer , it will go several rounds . \nRegardless of whether the regime survives or not -

'' \nIf there is a scale of courage , Marie was at the top of it . \nBecause she knew the reality of war , and that there are no guardian angels . \nShe learned that her life was not charmed in 2001 , when she lost an eye covering the war in Sri Lanka . \nSince then , she wore an eyepatch that she managed to turn into an iconic fashion accessory by sporting a diamante version to parties . \nBut her injury was not something she shrugged off lightly . \nShe later suffered post traumatic stress disorder so badly she had to be hospitalised . \nSo her courage was not the bravado of the foolhardy who imagine themselves invulnerable . \nIt was the quiet determination of someone who had to do what she believed she was for , knowing the risks and possible consequences . \nTo tell the story and give a voice to the voiceless . \nDespite her injury and the mental scars that went with it , she plunged back into the fray , covering countless wars and upheavals all over the Middle East and elsewhere . \nHer former husband Patrick Bishop , who covered the Middle East with her for the Telegraph in the 1990s , said he had never seen her show fear at all . \nOne abiding memory I have is a visit they made to the village house I had in Cyprus in 1990 . \nMarie - who could be glamorous when she wanted to and was as at home in London high society as she was roughing it on warfronts - gave my daughter Shona a faux Coco Chanel handbag as an arrival present . \nIt was treasured for years . \n`` It was a pretty awesome handbag for a four-year-old , '' says Shona , now 25 , who does n't rule out that it had a formative effect on her current career as a stylist for fashion magazines . \nLike that other great American journalist the Syrian crisis has claimed in recent days , Anthony Shadid of the New York Times , Marie - despite all the awards and accomplishments and recognition - remained modest and self-deprecating . \nAt a wake held by colleagues in Beirut on Monday evening for Anthony , who was buried in his ancestral hometown in southern Lebanon the day Marie died , we agreed that our odd profession is a sort of transnational tribe which had lost one - now two - of its exemplary figures , the very best . \nLike Anthony , she loved life despite her dedication to the job . \nShe loved parties and dinners , and was an accomplished ocean-racing yachtswoman . \nWhen she got horribly lost walking the simple 100m route from her hotel to my flat in Beirut last week , she laughed when I suggested cruelly that her monocular situation must have meant she was walking round in circles . \nYet there was something of the anxious little girl about her as she set off into the unknown on that last fateful journey , knowing the dangers that lay ahead . \nShe took only a small knapsack containing her satellite computer , some granola bars and a jar of instant coffee she said she could n't live without . \nWe knew it would be freezing cold - it snowed in Homs while she was there - so I lent her a pair of ill-fitting , Y-fronted longjohns to keep her warm . \nThey seem to have worked . \n`` Have made it to the heart of Baba Amro , '' she wrote when she arrived . \n`` Warm legs but all else wet , muddy and cold . \nYou would love it here . \nNo Thuraya -LRB- satphone -RRB- but email and so we can communicate . \nMx '' When the shelling of Homs resumed on Wednesday morning , I sent a message to Marie , who 'd done a searing interview on the BBC the day before . \n`` Great stuff Colvin . \nYou 'll put me out of a job ... More shelling today ... hope you 're keeping safe . \nI hate to think what state my longjohns are in by now ... come back soon ! \nKEEP SAFE YOU MAD PERSON Hopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n"}
