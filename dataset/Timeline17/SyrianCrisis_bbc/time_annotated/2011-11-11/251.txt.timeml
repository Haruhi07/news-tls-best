Syria : HRW urges suspension by Arab League Doctor in Homs : ` ` It 's a horror story ...
we are really in crisis ... heroes are treating patients on the street '' Human Rights Watch has called on the Arab League to suspend Syria , saying the abuses against civilians in Homs are crimes against humanity .
The US - based group has issued a report documenting allegations of torture and unlawful killings in the city of Homs .
The city has been a focus for anti - government demonstrations .
Dozens were reported killed there on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2011-11-10">Thursday</TIMEX3> .
The UN says at least 3,500 people have been killed in Syria in protests against President Bashar al - Assad .
They were beating me , and pouring water on me , and then using electric stun guns ''
The government blames the unrest on armed gangs and militants and say hundreds of soldiers and police have been killed .

But Sarah Leah Whitson , Middle East director at Human Rights Watch said the city of Homs represented : ` ` A microcosm of the Syrian government 's brutality '' .
She said that the Arab League , who are due to meet to discuss the crisis in Syria , must apply pressure after the country failed to honor the League 's plan to end the unrest .
` ` The Arab League needs to tell President Assad that violating their agreement has consequences , and that it <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> supports Security Council action to end the carnage . ''
Syrian authorities had agreed in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-11" mod="START">early November</TIMEX3> to withdraw from restive cities , set political prisoners free and start talks with the opposition .

But , since then , the UN says that the killing has continued .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2011-11-10">Thursday</TIMEX3> , nearly 40 people were killed across the country , including five soldiers and an eight - year - old girl , Syrian activists said .
The eight - month - old uprising has become increasingly armed , with Syrian soldiers joining the anti - government protesters in some areas , including Homs .
The city has seen repeated clashes between army defectors and security forces , who have been mounting raids in pursuit of protesters .
Human Rights Watch said it had conducted more than 110 interviews with witnesses and victims of the violence in Homs , both the city and the surrounding province of the same name .
In a report , entitled We Live As In War , HRW documents what it says are ` ` dozens of incidents in which security forces and government - supported militias violently attacked and dispersed overwhelmingly peaceful protests '' .
The HRW witnesses describe security forces firing machine guns or heavier weapons into districts of cities where protests have been taking place , to frighten the residents .
The BBC 's Jonathan Head , in neighbouring Turkey , says the report backs up accusations against the Syrian authorities by activists .
Syrian forces have sought for months to quell anti - government protests However , the allegations can not be independently verified because the Syrian government has banned most foreign journalists from entering the country .
Checkpoints around the district are set up to control movement and troops in armored vehicles move in to conduct raids .
One resident of Homs told HRW that when he and others tried to bring food into Bab Sba ' district , security forces opened fire , killing one person and wounding another in his group .
One woman protesting in Homs on <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2011-08-15">15 August</TIMEX3> with her family told HRW : ` ` It was calm , so everything seemed OK .
` ` Then two cars showed up suddenly and opened fire , targeting people even as they were ducking and lying on the ground .
They were white Kia Cerato cars with tinted windows , like those used by air force intelligence , '' she said .

` ` The doctors were able to remove the bullet , but it left a lot of damage , '' she said .
Thousands of people have been arrested since the anti - government protests began in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2011-03">March</TIMEX3> .
While most are eventually released , HRW says several hundred are missing .
Former detainees interviewed by HRW described being tortured with heated metal rods , electric shocks , beatings and being forced into ` ` stress positions '' for long periods .

` ` They were beating me , and pouring water on me , and then using electric stun guns , '' he added .
HRW said it had independently confirm 17 deaths in custody .
Twelve of these people ` ` bore unmistakable marks consistent with torture , including bruises , cuts and burns '' .
