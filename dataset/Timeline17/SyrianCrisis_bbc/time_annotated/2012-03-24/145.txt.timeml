The UN - Arab League envoy to Syria , Kofi Annan , has arrived in Moscow amid reports of 24 new civilian deaths in Syria .
Mr Annan will try to persuade Russia to take a firmer stance against the Syrian government .
<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2012-W13">Next week</TIMEX3> , he will travel to China which , like Russia , has generally supported Syria at the UN .
Ten of the new deaths were reported in Homs , the city at the heart of the revolt against Bashar al - Assad .
` ` The shelling started like it does every morning , for no reason , '' an activist in the city 's Bab Sbaa district told Reuters news agency via Skype .
` ` They are using mortar and tank fire on many neighborhoods of old Homs . ''
The activist added that most residents in the area had fled to safer districts and many were trying to escape the city altogether .
Foreign media face severe restrictions on reporting in Syria , and it is hard to verify the claims of either side .
The Associated Press news agency has seen video apparently showing a huge explosion in Homs .
The footage , released by an activist group called the Shaam News Network , shows a large ball of fire and plume of black smoke .
According to the London - based Observatory for Human Rights , a total of 24 civilians died on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2012-03-24">Saturday</TIMEX3> as well as 15 soldiers and two rebels .
One activist , Nureddin al - Abdo , told AFP news agency that government troops backed by 26 tanks had attacked the town of Saraqeb in the north - western province of Idlib .
All the signs are that the regime intends to continue its drive unless armed rebels simply surrender , the BBC 's Jim Muir reports from Beirut in neighbouring Lebanon .
That is the message to Kofi Annan as he urges the government to call an immediate halt to the use of heavy arms in populated areas , our correspondent says .
Whether the route ahead lies with his peace efforts , or with further confrontation , the opposition clearly needs to unify its divided ranks , he adds .
It has announced moves to unite its fragmented military efforts and also to hold a meeting in Istanbul on <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2012-03-19">Monday</TIMEX3> , to try to bring the various political groups together behind a shared vision for Syria 's future .
Hopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir .
