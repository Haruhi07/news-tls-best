UN official : We are afraid of Syrian refugee crisis <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2012-04-27">27 April 2012</TIMEX3> Last updated at 03:12 GMT Help UN Secretary General Ban Ki - moon has said the Syrian government is ` ` in contravention '' of an internationally agreed peace plan .
Antonio Guterres , UN High Commissioner for Refugees , says he believes events such as a deadly explosion in Hama on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2012-04-26">Thursday</TIMEX3> will lead to increased rate of refugees attempting to flee Syria .
Mr Guterres told the BBC 's Katty Kay that his mandate required strict independence , in order to preserve asylum spaces in all countries , especially as ` ` the old crises never die '' .
` ` The international community has not shown the capacity to prevent conflict and to address conflict , solving it quickly before it becomes protracted and before the humanitarian impact becomes sometimes devastating . ''
Hopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir .
