The UN report documents <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P3M">the last three months</TIMEX3> in Syria , during which , the investigators say , the violence has reached new and terrible levels .
They have evidence that Syrian forces have shot dead women and children , subjected civilian areas to merciless shelling , and tortured wounded protestors in hospital .
These systematic violations were ordered by high ranking figures in the military and government , the report says .
The investigators have compiled a confidential list of names of those they believe are responsible and sent it to the UN Human Rights Commissioner .
The implication is that those people - and President Assad is likely to be among them - will <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P1D">one day</TIMEX3> appear at the International Criminal Court .
The new report finds that Syria has become increasingly militarised , and accuses security forces of gross and systematic human rights violations .
The evidence against some senior Syrian army officers and government officials is such that the team has sent a list of their names and their alleged crimes to the UN human rights commissioner .

The UN secretary general says he wants to send his humanitarian chief to Syria to negotiate access to Homs .
Dozens of people were killed in Syria on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2012-02-22">Wednesday</TIMEX3> , including journalists Marie Colvin and Remi Ochlik .
Their deaths brought further condemnation of the Syrian government , which has denied responsibility for the killings .
Aid workers trying to retrieve the journalists ' bodies say they may have to be buried in Syria , as the roads out of Homs are blocked by the Syrian army .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2012-02-23">Thursday</TIMEX3> , rockets , artillery and mortar rounds pounded the opposition stronghold of Baba Amr , Inshaat and Khalidiya , activists said .
Activist Hadi Abdullah told AFP that he could hear ` ` terrifying explosions '' .
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said a ceasefire was ` ` imperative '' to enable food and medical supplies to be brought into Homs , which has been under siege since <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2012-02-04">4 February</TIMEX3> .
The city is one of the focal points of the uprising against the government of President Assad .
UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said the international community would be looking at further ways to apply pressure to Mr Assad .
` ` It is a deeply frustrating situation that people have been dying in their thousands ... that the Assad regime has continued to act seemingly with impunity - but I think we can agree to a wider set of measures across a large group of nations , '' Mr Hague said .
The European Union sanctions on Syria could be tightened further , Mr Hague added .

Remi Ochlik were killed on <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="TIME" value="2012-02-22TMO">Wednesday morning</TIMEX3> in the house in which they were staying in Baba Amr .
Three other Western journalists were wounded in the strike on the house , among them a British photographer , Paul Conroy , whose injuries are not thought to be life - threatening , and the French reporter Edith Bouvier .
Her situation is believed to be more serious .
France and the UK have demanded that they be given urgent medical assistance .
The editor of the <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2012-02-19">Sunday</TIMEX3> Times , John Witherow , said he thought it was possible that the journalists had been deliberately targeted , speculating that government forces may have been able to use technology to identify their precise location .
` ` It seems to me perfectly reasonable to assume that they would have targeted them , '' he told the BBC .
World and Arab leaders are due to meet in Tunisia on <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2012-02-17">Friday</TIMEX3> to discuss Syria 's future .
But Russia , a key ally of President Assad , says it will not attend the ` ` Friends of Syria '' meeting because the Syrian government would not be represented .
Russia and China have faced Western and Arab criticism for blocking a UN Security Council resolution that would have backed an Arab League peace plan for Syria .
Opposition groups claim more than 7,500 people have been killed since the start of the uprising <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2011-03">11 months ago</TIMEX3> .
The Syrian government says at least 2,000 of its forces have died fighting ` ` armed terrorists , '' as it calls the rebels .
Hopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir .
