Syria unrest : Civilians need protection , says UN Activists said thousands of people protested in a number of Syrian cities on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2011-08-26">Friday</TIMEX3> A UN investigative team has wrapped up its visit to Syria , concluding that ` ` there is an urgent need to protect civilians '' from excessive force .
The team , the first Syria has allowed in since a deadly crackdown on protests began in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-03">March</TIMEX3> , said there was no countrywide humanitarian crisis .
The UN says more than 2,200 people have been killed in the violence .
The UN Security Council is split over whether to impose sanctions against Syria 's leadership over the crackdown .
Syria had refused for months to allow a UN mission into the country to investigate the violence .
The government allowed the team in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2011-W33">last week</TIMEX3> , promising full and unfettered access .
` ` The mission concluded that although there 's no countrywide humanitarian crisis , there is an urgent need to protect civilians from the excessive use of force , '' said UN spokesman Farhan Haq .
But the promised free access did not materialise .
` ` The constant presence of government officials limited the mission 's ability to fully and independently assess the situation , '' Mr Haq said .
In areas the team visited where there had been unrest , ` ` people ... said they felt extremely intimidated and under constant threat '' .
President Assad says his security forces are tackling ` ` armed criminal gangs '' Demonstrations against the rule of President Bashar al - Assad began in mid - <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-03">March</TIMEX3> and have since spread across much of the country .
President Assad has sent in tanks and troops to hotbeds of protest , activists have said , but the demonstrations have continued .
The government has blamed the unrest on ` ` armed criminal gangs '' .
Human rights groups estimate 500 soldiers have been killed in the unrest , which has seen thousands of people arrested .
Most foreign journalists have been barred from Syria , making it difficult to verify reports from local activists and officials .
Activists said at least three people were killed on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2011-08-26">Friday</TIMEX3> as thousands of people came out to protest in a number of cities after <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011-08-26">Friday</TIMEX3> prayers - the last in the month of Ramadan .
At the UN Security Council , the battle over what to do about Syria has heated up , says the BBC 's UN correspondent Barbara Plett .
Russia and a group consisting of the US , France , Britain , Germany and Portugal submitted rival draft resolutions on Syria .
The Russian draft calls for the Syrian government to speed up reforms and for the opposition to take part in political dialogue .
The US - European draft calls for a freeze of President Assad 's assets and an arms embargo against Syria .
Russia 's UN ambassador Vitaly Churkin said the Western group was ` ` stirring up the opposition '' in Syria .
Our UN correspondent says there is no immediate plan for a vote on the rival drafts .
Hopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir .
