By PJ Crowley Former US Assistant Secretary of State US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Russia must be at the table for a political transition in Syria to occur Syria may be at a tipping point , as UN Special Envoy Kofi Annan cautioned <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2012-W22" mod="START">early last week</TIMEX3> , following the Houla tragedy .
But in his discussions with European leaders , which continue <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2012-W23">this week</TIMEX3> , newly restored Russian President Vladimir Putin made clear Houla would not be a pivot - point for Russian policy or a catalysing moment for the international community .
Unlike Tunisia , Egypt , Libya and Yemen , which were resolved in days , weeks or months , events in Syria will grind on for months and perhaps longer .
Syrian President Bashar al - Assad may be on his ` ` last legs '' , as US Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice suggested , but his demise will , more likely than not , be a long , painful process .
This transition , already a tragedy , will unfold in slow - motion .
Congresswoman Jane Harman says there is ` ` little value '' in the Syria peace plan There was some anticipation that Houla - where an estimated 108 people were killed , many executed - would become for Syria what Srebrenica was for Bosnia .
After the massacre of 8,000 men and boys in Srebrenica in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="1995-07">July 1995</TIMEX3> an ineffectual international response turned far more intense .
Within <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="P6M">six months</TIMEX3> , a political agreement at Dayton , Ohio , ended the conflict and included a military intervention that enforced it .

But the present situation could resemble not <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="1995">1995</TIMEX3> but <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="1993">1993</TIMEX3> , when the conflict was still accelerating .
International monitoring was ineffective , peace plans were developed and ignored and the international community , particularly the United States , was not yet sufficiently invested to stop it .
Residents of Taldou village in the Houla region say that after an anti - government protest on <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2013-05-25">25 May</TIMEX3> , the army began an 18 - hour bombardment Some accounts say rebel fighters attacked the military position from where shellfire was coming Unconfirmed reports say pro - government shabiha militia entered Taldou , killing people at home , shooting them in the head or cutting their throats UN observers say at least 108 people died , including 49 children and 34 women .
No more than 20 appeared to have been killed by shellfire A government investigation blames armed groups seeking to trigger foreign military intervention The first Bush administration hesitated to get significantly involved in the violent dissolution of the former Yugoslavia - former Secretary of State James Baker famously said : ` ` We do n't have a dog in this fight . ''
Washington sought to avoid a public confrontation with Moscow as it managed the emerging ` ` new world order '' that would soon see the Soviet Union itself disappear .
Former US President Bill Clinton was elected to fix more urgent challenges at home - ` ` It 's the economy , stupid '' - not abroad .
Somalia reinforced Clinton 's instinct to keep Bosnia at arm 's length .
But after the failure to intercede in Rwanda , confronted with the potential genocide in the Balkans , the United States became fully engaged .
Propelled by his success in Bosnia , Mr Clinton devoted much of his second term to conflict resolution from the Middle East and Northern Ireland to Africa and Asia .
If Mr Bush and Mr Clinton felt a tail - wind as the United States emerged from the Cold War with unprecedented power , President Barack Obama felt a headwind from the squandering of that power during the Iraq War and the global economic crisis .
The Obama administration has clearly , if somewhat inconsistently -LRB- much firmer with dictators than monarchs -RRB- supported the dramatic political developments that have come with the Arab Awakening .
But , while broadly engaged politically , it has presumed from the outset that the US could only affect regional change on the margins .

For understandable reasons , Mr Obama has been far more focused on ending wars than starting them .
The exception , of course , is Libya , although the Obama administration went to great lengths to downplay its role , even declining to term the Nato intervention as ` ` hostilities '' for domestic legal and political reasons .
Yet , Libya looms large on all sides of the Syria debate .
For the Syrians , it set high expectations that the international community would provide protection as they mounted a political challenge to the Assad regime .
Vladimir Putin has indicated Houla was not a turning point for Russia 's position on Syria Nato , backed by an Arab League request and UN Security Council resolution , not only protected the Libyan people but also directly supported the rebel advance that eventually toppled Muammar Gaddafi 's regime .

If Libya , why not Syria The United States rejects the idea that Libya set a precedent for Syria , preferring to view all Middle East transitions on a case - by - case basis .
It remains sceptical of what can be accomplished in Syria militarily at an acceptable cost , particularly given Russian and Iranian political , economic and military support .
The ideal conditions that enabled the Libyan intervention - Arab League and UN support , and Nato and international participation - are <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> considered necessary pre - requisites for action in Syria .
Maybe Syria , if and when For its part , Europe is <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> engaged in an existential economic struggle centred for the moment around Greece , but potentially affecting other countries as well .
And in <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DURATION" value="P8M">the eight months</TIMEX3> since Gaddafi 's death , two leaders who helped launch Nato 's Libya operation - France 's Nicholas Sarkozy and Italy 's Silvio Berlusconi - are no longer in office .
Process led by Syrian parties working with international envoy 2 .
End to violence by all sides ; army troops to stop using heavy weapons and withdraw to barracks 3 .
Parties to allow humanitarian aid 4 .
Authorities to free detainees 5 .
Authorities to ensure freedom of movement for journalists 6 .
Authorities to allow peaceful demonstrations Europe is sympathetic to Syria 's plight , but has its hands full .
Another leader who allowed Libya to happen , Dmitry Medvedev , is <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> Russia 's prime minister and no longer responsible for international affairs .
Mr Putin , who is , will block aggressive international action that threatens the status quo and Russia 's already declining influence -LRB- not to mention market share -RRB- in the region .
Voicing some support for a Yemen - style solution , Russia will seek to preserve the Syrian regime with or without Assad and is willing to bear whatever political costs the United States , Europe and the Gulf states can impose at present .
Given significant divisions within the Arab League , those costs are viewed as manageable .
Over <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2012-W22-WE">the weekend</TIMEX3> US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , while criticising Russia 's ongoing support of the Assad regime , reiterated that Russia must be at the table for a political transition to occur .
<TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> back in the game , Mr Putin appears to be in no hurry to deal .
Whether or not this is good for Russia , it is tragic for the Syrian people .
PJ Crowley is a former US Assistant Secretary of State in the administration of President Barack Obama .
