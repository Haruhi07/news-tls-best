The unrest began in the southern city of Deraa in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2012-03">March</TIMEX3>
The Syrian authorities have responded to anti - government protests with overwhelming military force since they erupted in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-03">March 2011</TIMEX3> .
The protests pose the greatest challenge to <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P4DE">four decades</TIMEX3> of Assad family rule in the country .
Here is an overview of the uprising , in which the UN says more than 9,000 people have been killed by security forces and at least 14,000 others detained .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2012-02">February</TIMEX3> , the government put the death toll at 3,838 - 2,493 civilians and 1,345 security forces personnel .
How did the protests start ?
The unrest began in the southern city of Deraa in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2012-03">March</TIMEX3> when locals gathered to demand the release of 14 school children who were arrested and reportedly tortured after writing on a wall the well - known slogan of the popular uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt : ` ` The people want the downfall of the regime . ''
The protesters also called for democracy and greater freedom , though not President Assad 's resignation .
The peaceful show of dissent was , however , too much for the government and when people marched though the city after <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2012-04-06">Friday</TIMEX3> prayers on <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2012-03-18">18 March</TIMEX3> , security forces opened fire , killing four people .
<TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2012-03-19">The following day</TIMEX3> , they shot at mourners at the victims ' funerals , killing another person .
Within days , the unrest in Deraa had spiralled out of the control of the local authorities .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2012-03" mod="END">late March</TIMEX3> , the army 's fourth armored division - commanded by the president 's brother , Maher - was sent in to crush the emboldened protesters .
Dozens of people were killed , as tanks shelled residential areas and troops stormed homes , rounding up those believed to have attended demonstrations .
But the crackdown failed to stop the unrest in Deraa , instead triggering anti - government protests in other towns and cities across the country , including Baniyas , Homs , Hama and the suburbs of Damascus .
The army subsequently besieged them , blaming ` ` armed gangs and terrorists '' for the unrest .
By mid - <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2011-05">May</TIMEX3> , the death toll had reached 1,000 .
What do the protesters want and what have they got ?
Protesters began somewhat cautiously by calling for democracy and greater freedom in what is one of the most repressive countries in the Arab world .
But once security forces opened fire on peaceful demonstrations , people demanded that Mr Assad resign .
The president has resolutely refused to step down , but in the few public statements he has made since <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2012-03">March</TIMEX3> he has offered some concessions and promised reform .
The 48 - year - long state of emergency was ended in <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2011-04">April 2011</TIMEX3> , while a new constitution offering multi - party elections was approved in a referendum in <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2012-02">February 2012</TIMEX3> .
But activists say that - as long as people continue to be killed - Mr Assad 's promises count for very little .
Mr Assad has made clear that he has no intention to step down End to the 48 - year - old emergency law He revoked the emergency law on <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="2011-04-21">21 April 2011</TIMEX3> , but Syrian forces continued to open fire on demonstrations and detain people without arrest warrants
Immediate end to extrajudicial killings and torture The president has rejected as ` ` false '' allegations made by the UN that Syrian security forces have committed crimes against humanity , including killings , torture , rape , imprisonment , and other forms of severe deprivation of liberty and disappearances Release of political prisoners and detained protesters Amnesties were offered to political prisoners in <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="2011-05">May 2011</TIMEX3> , <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DATE" value="2011-06">June 2011</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="DATE" value="2012-01">January 2012</TIMEX3> .
Officials say thousands were released , but as many as 37,000 are still in prison , according to human rights activists Transition to a democratic , free and pluralistic society On <TIMEX3 tid="t38" type="DATE" value="2012-02-26">26 February 2012</TIMEX3> , voters approved in a referendum a new constitution , which sees the inclusion of political parties beyond the ruling Baath Party , and drops an article making the party the ` ` leader of state and society '' .
It also limits the president to two seven - year terms .
Mr Assad has also decreed on <TIMEX3 tid="t43" type="DATE" value="2012-03-14">14 March</TIMEX3> that parliamentary elections will be held on <TIMEX3 tid="t44" type="DATE" value="2011-05-07">7 May</TIMEX3> .
The opposition has dismissed both the constitution and the elections Is there an organised opposition ?

The Syrian authorities have long restricted the activities of disparate opposition parties and activists , and they played a minor role at the start of the uprising .
However , as the protests spread across the country and the government crackdown intensified , opposition groups publicly declared their support for the protesters ' demands and in <TIMEX3 tid="t45" type="DATE" value="2011-10">October</TIMEX3> several announced the formation of a united front , the Syrian National Council -LRB- SNC -RRB- .
SNC chairman Burhan Ghalioun wants to unite groups seeking peaceful change in Syria Led by the Paris - based dissident Burhan Ghalioun and including the Muslim Brotherhood , it aims to provide ` ` the necessary support for the revolution to progress and realize the aspirations of our people for the overthrow of the regime , its symbols and its head '' .
It hopes to offer a credible alternative to President Assad 's government and serve as a single point of contact for the international community .
The SNC , which is dominated by Syria 's majority Sunni Muslim community , has struggled to win over Christians and members of President Assad 's Alawite sect , who each make up about 10 % of the population and have so far stayed loyal to the government .
The council 's primacy has also been challenged by the National Co - ordination Committee -LRB- NCC -RRB- , an opposition bloc that still functions within Syria and is led by longstanding dissidents , some of whom are wary of the Islamists within the SNC .
Several members of the SNC have also complained about its ineffectual leadership .
The disunity has frustrated the international community , so at <TIMEX3 tid="t48" type="DATE" value="2012-03" mod="END">the end of March 2012</TIMEX3> all the main groups , with the exception of the NCC , put aside their differences and agreed that the SNC would be the ` ` formal interlocutor and formal representative of the Syrian people '' .
They were also united in their scepticism at the peace plan presented by the UN and Arab League envoy , Kofi Annan .
The opposition has also found it difficult to work with the Free Syrian Army -LRB- FSA -RRB- , a group of army defectors which is seeking to topple Mr Assad by force .
Based in Turkey , its fighters have launched increasingly deadly and audacious attacks on security forces in the north - western province of Idlib , around the central cities of Homs and Hama , and even on the outskirts of Damascus .
The opposition has also found it difficult to work with the Free Syrian Army , a group of army defectors In <TIMEX3 tid="t53" type="DATE" value="2012-01">January 2012</TIMEX3> , residents of Zabadani , a mountain town 40 km -LRB- 25 miles -RRB- north - west of the capital , said it had been ` ` liberated '' by FSA fighters .
Days later , defectors seized control of Douma , a suburb 10 km -LRB- six miles -RRB- from Damascus , for <TIMEX3 tid="t54" type="DURATION" value="PTXH">a few hours</TIMEX3> .
But in <TIMEX3 tid="t57" type="DATE" value="2012-02">February 2012</TIMEX3> , government forces launched an offensive on FSA strongholds in Homs .
FSA fighters staged a ` ` tactical withdrawal '' on <TIMEX3 tid="t59" type="DATE" value="2012-03-01">1 March</TIMEX3> , after a <TIMEX3 tid="t61" type="DURATION" value="P1M" mod="LESS_THAN">nearly a month</TIMEX3> of intense bombardment in which an estimated 700 people were killed .
<TIMEX3 tid="t63" type="DATE" value="2012-03-15">Two weeks later</TIMEX3> , troops took control of the northern city of Idlib from the FSA after <TIMEX3 tid="t65" type="DURATION" value="P4D">four days</TIMEX3> of fighting , activists said .
The FSA 's leader , Riyad al - Asaad , claims to have 15,000 men under his command , though analysts believe there may be no more than 7,000 .
They are also still poorly armed , and many have only basic training .
The FSA agreed in <TIMEX3 tid="t73" type="DATE" value="2012-03">March 2012</TIMEX3> to abide by the terms of Kofi Annan 's peace plan , which demanded a ceasefire by all parties on <TIMEX3 tid="t72" type="DATE" value="2012-04-10">10 April</TIMEX3> .
But after the Syrian foreign ministry announced on <TIMEX3 tid="t75" type="DATE" value="2012-04-08">8 April</TIMEX3> that the army would not withdraw troops and tanks from populated areas until ` ` armed terrorist groups '' had presented written guarantees of a ` ` halt to all violence '' , the FSA cast doubt on the initiative .
Col Asaad said that while the rebels were ` ` committed '' , they did not recognize the Assad government ` ` and for that reason we will not give guarantees '' .
What is the international community doing ?
Syria is a major player in the Middle East .
Any chaos here could cause knock - on effects in countries such as Lebanon and Israel , where it can mobilise powerful proxy groups , such as the militant Hezbollah and Hamas movements .
It also has close ties with Shia power Iran - an arch - foe of the US , Israel and Saudi Arabia - which could potentially draw those powers into a dangerous Middle Eastern conflict .

The Arab League observer mission in Syria failed to halt the crackdown on dissent The Arab League initially remained silent on the issue of Syria - although it backed the Nato - led bombing campaign against Libya 's Col Muammar Gaddafi in a bid to protect civilians there .
The 22 - member group called for an end to the violence , but cited hesitation over any action because of ` ` strategic and political considerations '' .
But in <TIMEX3 tid="t78" type="DATE" value="2011-11">November 2011</TIMEX3> , member states led by Qatar and Saudi Arabia surprised observers by voting to suspend Syria in an effort to force President Assad to end the crackdown .
The League later imposed economic sanctions when the Syrian government hesitated over allowing the deployment of an observer mission to verify its implementation of a peace initiative , which demanded the withdrawal of troops and tanks from the streets .
Damascus eventually allowed in the observers in <TIMEX3 tid="t81" type="DATE" value="2011-12">December 2011</TIMEX3> , but they failed to halt the crackdown on dissent .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t84" type="DATE" value="2012-01" mod="END">late January 2012</TIMEX3> , the Arab League laid out an ambitious plan of political reform , which called on President Assad to delegate power to a vice - president , to engage in proper dialogue with the opposition within <TIMEX3 tid="t87" type="DURATION" value="P2W">two weeks</TIMEX3> , and form a government of national unity in <TIMEX3 tid="t88" type="DURATION" value="P2M">two months</TIMEX3> .
The League said this should eventually lead to multi - party elections overseen by international observers .
<TIMEX3 tid="t89" type="DURATION" value="P1W">A week</TIMEX3> later , following a dramatic increase in violence , the League suspended its observer mission .
The League sought the support of the UN Security Council for its Syrian reform plan , rejected by Damascus on the grounds that it would infringe on national sovereignty .

But a UN resolution supporting the plan was vetoed by Russia , which has significant economic and military ties with Syria , and by China .
It was their second veto on Security Council action .
Moscow has expressed concern that it would pave the way for military intervention .

The UN and Arab League dispatched a special envoy , Kofi Annan , to Syria in <TIMEX3 tid="t91" type="DATE" value="2012-03">March</TIMEX3> In <TIMEX3 tid="t93" type="DATE" value="2012-03">March 2012</TIMEX3> , after a nearly month - long bombardment of Homs by government forces that left an estimated 700 people dead and outraged many in the international community , the UN and Arab League dispatched a special envoy , former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan , to Syria .
He proposed to President Assad a six - point peace plan that called for a UN - supervised ceasefire by all parties , a political process to address the ` ` aspirations '' of the Syrian people , the release of detainees , delivery of aid , free movement for journalists , and the right to protest .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t96" type="DATE" value="2012-03-27">27 March 2012</TIMEX3> , Mr Annan said the Syrian government had agreed to accept the peace plan .
<TIMEX3 tid="t100" type="DATE" value="2012-04-02">Six days later</TIMEX3> , he told the UN Security Council that President Assad had committed to withdraw his security forces from populated areas by <TIMEX3 tid="t101" type="DATE" value="2012-04-10">10 April</TIMEX3> , with a general ceasefire within <TIMEX3 tid="t104" type="DURATION" value="P2D">48 hours</TIMEX3> contingent on that withdrawal .
Though deeply sceptical , Western and Arab nations gave their backing to the initiative , while the opposition warned that it was likely a tactic by the Syrian government to prolong the crackdown on dissent .
As the ceasefire deadline approached , the violence continued unabated , with hundreds of people being killed in army assaults on opposition strongholds and clashes with rebels .
Then on <TIMEX3 tid="t106" type="DATE" value="2012-04-08">8 April</TIMEX3> , the Syrian foreign ministry announced that the army would not withdraw until ` ` armed terrorist groups '' had presented written guarantees of a ` ` halt to all violence '' .
The rebel Free Syrian Army rejected the demand , saying its fighters did not recognize the government and would ` ` not give guarantees '' to lay down their arms .
Is this a sectarian conflict ?
Syria is a country of 21 million people with a large Sunni majority -LRB- 74 % -RRB- and significant minorities -LRB- 10 % each -RRB- of Christians and Alawites - the Shia sect to which Mr Assad belongs .
For years , Mr Assad has promoted a secular identity for the Syrian state , hoping to unify diverse communities in a region where sectarian conflict is rife - as seen in neighbouring Lebanon and Iraq .
The regime can still mobilise support , especially from minority groups and the upper classes However , he also concentrated power in the hands of his family and members of the Alawite community , who wield a disproportionate power in the Syrian government , military and business elite .
Claims of corruption and nepotism have been rife among the excluded Sunni majority .
And protests have generally been biggest in Sunni - dominated rural areas , towns and cities , as opposed to mixed areas .
Opposition figures have stressed that they seek a ` ` multi - national , multi - ethnic and religiously tolerant society '' .
But there are fears of chaos and instability - even talk of civil war - if Mr Assad should fall .
Activists say these fears are overblown .
What is the economic fallout of the unrest in Syria ?
Major ethnic groups : Arabs -LRB- 90 % -RRB- , Kurds -LRB- 9 % -RRB- , Armenians , Circassians , Turkomans In <TIMEX3 tid="t111" type="DATE" value="2011-06">June 2011</TIMEX3> , President Assad warned Syrians that ` ` the most dangerous thing '' facing their country was ` ` the weakness or collapse '' of its economy .
Even before the unrest , Syrians had endured decades of high unemployment , widespread poverty and rising food prices .
<TIMEX3 tid="t112" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> , business , farming and trade have been hard hit by economic sanctions imposed by the Arab League , the European Union , the United States and neighbouring Turkey .
Syria 's two most vital sectors - tourism and oil - have ground to a halt .
The IMF says Syria 's economy contracted by 2 % in <TIMEX3 tid="t113" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3> , while the value of the Syrian pound has crashed to its lowest level in black - market trading .
Even on the official exchange rates , the Syrian pound has plummeted by more than 60 % against the dollar .
Inflation is also increasing rapidly , with the official rate up to 11 % in <TIMEX3 tid="t116" type="DATE" value="2012-03">March 2012</TIMEX3> .
Unemployment is estimated to have risen to more than 20 % since the uprising began .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t119" type="DATE" value="2012-02">February 2012</TIMEX3> , the government doubled customs duties , which analysts said would lead to smuggling and price rises .
Towns and cities , including the capital Damascus , are suffering electricity cuts , and critical products like heating oil and staples like milk powder are scarce .
Hopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by <TIMEX3 tid="t120" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir .
