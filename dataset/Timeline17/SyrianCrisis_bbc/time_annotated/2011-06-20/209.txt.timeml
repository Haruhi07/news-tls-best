<TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2011-06-20">20 June 11</TIMEX3> 16:14 GMT Supporters of Syrian President Bashar al - Assad say his speech was encouraging and responsive to people 's demands , but his opponents say they have heard it all before and that the only solution they will accept is the fall of the regime .
` ` We were not expecting something huge from the regime because we have seen their actions and know how they are dealing with peaceful protesters , '' Adel Othman , the Damascus spokesperson of the protest co - ordinating committees , told the BBC .
` ` They put the security solution as the only -LRB- priority -RRB- .

As for promises of reform , we are used to it What we want <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> is not reform , but to topple the regime and change it , '' says Mr Othman .
Protesters in the street have also been calling for an end to the violence and killing .
Human rights groups say at least 1,300 civilians and more than 300 soldiers have been killed since the protests started in mid - <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2011-03">March</TIMEX3> .
Another 10,000 people have been detained .
The regime claims that armed gangs are trying to hijack protesters ' legitimate demands by using violence against civilians , the army and security forces .
But the protesters insist they are peaceful .
` ` The problem is in the regime , '' says Mr Othman .
` ` What was offered does n't match the ambition of the street , so as local co - ordination committees , we refuse these offers . ''
He called for security forces to be held accountable for their actions - noting that Mr Assad made no mention of this key demand in his address .
` ` These reform promises are just to deceive Syrians , and intended for world consumption , '' he added .
Soon after the speech , protesters are reported to have taken to the streets in several cities including Hama , Aleppo and Latakia .
` ` No to dialogue with murderers , '' protesters were heard chanting in the Damascus suburb of Irbin , when reached by telephone by the Reuters news agency .
At the same time , rival rallies in support of the Syrian president were also reported at Damascus University and the nearby al - Umawiyeen Square .

<TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="PTXH">A few hours</TIMEX3> after the speech , a text message was sent out on mobile networks , calling on government loyalists to rally at Umayyad Square in central Damascus on <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2011-06-14">Tuesday</TIMEX3> to show their support for President Assad .
Rateb Shallah , head of the Syrian Chambers of Commerce Federation , was at the speech on <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2011-06-20">Monday</TIMEX3> and expressed confidence in the president 's promised reforms .
` ` I hope it will be a turning point in solving the crisis and that it will meet the demands of the Syrian people , '' he said .
But several of the youth protesters who watched the address on TV said they were disappointed .
` ` <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2011-06-24">Next Friday</TIMEX3> will not be peaceful and the days to come will be difficult , '' said one , speaking in Damascus on condition of anonymity .
According to Louai Hussein , another opposition activist , the speech was addressed to the president 's loyalists , not his opponents .
` ` Nothing new was said , '' says Mr Hussein , who is part of an opposition committee that published a roadmap for political reform <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">a few days ago</TIMEX3> .
The roadmap outlines the steps needed to address the <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> crisis , but its main aim is to end the violence and killing .
` ` What was mentioned was very important , but it does n't solve the problem with the protesters .
There is a need for real freedom so that change can start , '' he added .
In his speech , delivered at Damascus University , Mr Assad stressed that the priority is for people to be engaged in the political process , and to contribute to decision making about political reform .
The fact that the president addressed youth at the university may be seen as an acknowledgement that parliament does not represent the people and that there is a pressing need for free elections .
The majority of protesters and opposition supporters believe that a political solution is the way forward , but for that to happen , there must be an immediate end to the repression and killing , they say .
