Syria unrest : Reporters ' deaths spark Western outrage Marie Colvin and Remi Ochlik were killed in a makeshift media center in Homs <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2012-02-19">Sunday</TIMEX3> Times reporter Marie Colvin , an American , and French photographer Remi Ochlik died in shelling by Syria 's government forces .
The US said it was ` ` another example of the shameless brutality '' of the regime .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy said : ` ` That 's enough ...
The regime must go . ''
Syrian troops have been shelling opposition - held areas of Homs for weeks .
Thousands have died since the unrest erupted <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2011-03">last March</TIMEX3> .
The International Red Cross said it hoped <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2012-02-22">Wednesday</TIMEX3> 's deaths would draw the attention of the world to the many hundreds of other people suffering in Syria .
It earlier urged the government and rebels to agree to a daily ceasefire , to allow medical supplies to reach the worst affected areas and get civilians out .
However , there is no sign yet of this being agreed .
Colvin , 56 , and Ochlik , 28 , were reportedly staying in a house in Homs ' area of Baba Amr that was being used by activists as a media center when it was hit by a shell on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="TIME" value="2012-02-22TMO">Wednesday morning</TIMEX3> .
Marie would not want any tribute to leave out mention of the people she met , the stories she heard .
She often spoke of how humbled she was by the ` ` quiet bravery of civilians '' .
We ' ve come to expect that wherever something of consequence was happening , Marie would be there .
Her signature was not just to go to a story , but to stay for as long as she could , regardless of the danger or discomfort .
She admired the pioneering journalism of fellow American Martha Gelhorn .
I always saw her as the Martha of our generation : brave and beautiful .
A woman with a wicked laugh , a sensitive soul , and a steely determination to tell the stories that mattered .
She had both guts and glamour .
I remember a conversation long ago where she told me a partner wanted her to be what she called a ` ` Laura Ashley '' - pretty and perfect in the home .

But that was n't Marie
and she knew it .
She was , without exception , a kind and considerate colleague and fellow traveller , a woman who inspired and engaged .
At least two other foreign journalists were wounded , activists said .
One was named as British freelance photographer Paul Conroy , who was working with Colvin , and Edith Bouvier of the French newspaper , Le Figaro .
Bouvier was said to be in a serious condition .
The dead and the injured journalists are said to have been taken to a field clinic in Baba Amr .
Activists have expressed fears that Bouvier risks bleeding to death without urgent medical attention and they were trying to get her out .
Syrian state TV said the information ministry had asked officials in Homs to determine the location of foreign journalists because it had learned that some may have been injured .
In Washington , US State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said : ` ` This tragic incident is another example of the shameless brutality of the Assad regime . ''
Earlier , the US warned that it was not ruling out taking ` ` additional measures '' to assist the rebels if the government onslaught continued .
In Paris , French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said his country held the Syrian government accountable for the deaths .
` ` Damascus owes us an answer , '' Mr Juppe said .
UK Prime Minister David Cameron told parliament : ` ` This is a desperately sad reminder of the risks that journalists take to inform the world of what is happening , and the dreadful events in Syria . ''
Later , the Syrian ambassador to London was summoned to be told that the UK expected Damascus to arrange for the immediate repatriation of the journalists ' bodies and to provide medical treatment for the injured British journalist .

The editor of the <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2012-02-19">Sunday</TIMEX3> Times , John Witherow , said the newspaper was doing what it could to recover Colvin 's body and get Conroy to safety .
` ` Marie was an extraordinary figure in the life of the <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2012-02-19">Sunday</TIMEX3> Times , driven by a passion to cover wars in the belief that what she did mattered , '' he added .
` ` She believed profoundly that reporting could curtail the excesses of brutal regimes and make the international community take notice . ''
Her mother told journalists Colvin 's legacy was : ` ` Be passionate and be involved in what you believe in .

And do it as thoroughly and honestly and fearlessly as you can . ''
Ochlik had reported from Haiti and covered many of the <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> uprisings in the Arab world .
<TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2012-02-19">Sunday</TIMEX3> Times Editor John Witherow : ` ` She may have been targeted '' Colvin had been a foreign correspondent for the <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2012-02-19">Sunday</TIMEX3> Times for <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="P2DE">two decades</TIMEX3> , and had reported from several war zones .
She lost the sight in one eye in Sri Lanka in <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2001">2001</TIMEX3> after being hit by shrapnel .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2012-02-21">Tuesday</TIMEX3> , she told the BBC the bombardment of Baba Amr by Syrian government artillery and tanks had been ` ` unrelenting '' .
` ` I watched a little baby die <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2012-02-22">today</TIMEX3> , absolutely horrific , a two year old - found the shrapnel had gone into the left chest and the doctor said : ' I ca n't do anything , ' and his little tummy just kept heaving until he died .
That is happening over and over and over .
But increasingly , they have risked entering the country undercover , helped by networks of activists , to report from flashpoints .
<TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2012-01">Last month</TIMEX3> , the French television journalist , Gilles Jacquier , was killed in Homs while visiting the city on a government - organised trip .
Anthony Shadid , of the New York Times , died of an apparent asthma attack in Syria <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2012-W07">last week</TIMEX3> .
Hopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir .
