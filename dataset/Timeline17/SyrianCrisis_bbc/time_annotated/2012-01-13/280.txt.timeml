A car used by Arab League monitors was attacked in Damascus Damascus on a rainy <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2012-WI">winter</TIMEX3> 's evening .
The lights are blazing , the traffic flows smoothly , the smart boutiques of the new town and the souks in the old city seem busy enough .
But for all the assurances of the government , life in the Syrian capital is far from normal .
` ` We do n't work well , we do n't sleep well , '' one middle - class woman , a graphic designer in her <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="193">thirties</TIMEX3> , tells me .
` ` We are scared . ''
She does n't take part in street protests herself .
Like many others , she thinks it is too dangerous .

But she certainly supports their aim .
And those protests - once mainly in towns well away from Damascus - <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2012-SP">spring</TIMEX3> up ever more frequently in suburbs of the capital , creeping closer and closer , it appears , to the well - guarded center .
The impression of ever - deepening crisis is one the government is determined to resist .
<TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2012-W02">This week</TIMEX3> President Bashar al - Assad made what was said to be an impromptu appearance with his family on a huge city - centre square .
President al - Assad made a reportedly impromptu rally appearance He was cheered by thousands of supporters also said to have gathered spontaneously to greet him .
` ` Nothing was arranged beforehand , '' my government minder tells me .
` ` If people had known the president was going to appear , millions would have turned out to cheer .

But he just decided to stop to talk on the square because he 's that kind of person .
He lives among the people .
You can often see him in a local shop buying sweets for his children . ''
In his unscripted speech on the square , the president returned yet again to his favorite theme :
Syria is threatened by a foreign conspiracy that is in league with ` ` terrorists '' within the country .
He is talking not only of Western powers such as the United States , which <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2012-W02">this week</TIMEX3> accused him of ` ` cynicism , '' but also of Arab states such as Qatar , one of the chief movers behind the Arab League monitoring mission being sent to Syria .
Qatar has <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> suggested the mission is so ineffective in stopping the violence that it should be withdrawn .
Anti - government protests are moving ever closer to the city center Speaking anonymously - because the terms of their engagement forbid them talking to the media - some of the monitors tell me they are more afraid of going into pro - government areas than into opposition strongholds .
Crowds have vented their anger on what they see as the monitors ' interference in Syrian affairs .
And in the car park of the Sheraton Hotel , one of their bases , you can see the evidence of that anger - Arab League vehicles with windows smashed and plastered with stickers of Mr Assad , the bumpers caved in and tyres let down .
At the Foreign Ministry , spokesman Jihad Makdissi tells me that should not have happened .
People have <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> been told , he says , to let the monitors work freely .
And he is also keen to stress that the president 's talk of a conspiracy was ` ` for internal consumption '' .
Syria wants the mission to continue , he says .
But on <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2012-01-12">Thursday</TIMEX3> another 18 deaths were reported in the continuing struggle between demonstrators and security forces - bringing to more than 400 the number killed since the mission began in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2011-12" mod="END">late December</TIMEX3> .
More than 5,000 civilians have been killed , says the UN More than 400 killed since start of Arab League mission on <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2011-12-26">26 December</TIMEX3> UN denied access to Syria Information gathered from NGOs , sources in Syria and Syrians who have fled Vast majority of casualties were unarmed , but the figure may include armed defectors Tally does not include serving members of the security forces In the meantime , Mr Assad continues to insist that he wants dialogue with opposition forces , and he has set out what he says is a timetable for democratic reforms .
But he has been saying the same thing for months , without any sign of his government reaching out even to those elements of the highly - fractured opposition that would be prepared to talk to him .
It is a stalemate , but a dangerous one in which more and more protesters , who once insisted demonstrations must be peaceful , <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> believe some of their number should carry guns - not to attack the security forces , but at least to defend themselves against attack .
` ` The regime is launched down a cul - de - sac '' , one Western diplomat tells me .
And many fear that at the end of it will be even more violence .
