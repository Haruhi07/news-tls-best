Analysts say its ability to keep control of Aleppo is one of its key tests .
Separately , the UN Secretary General Ban Ki - moon has said that Islamist militants from al - Qaeda must be behind two deadly suicide car bomb attacks in the capital on <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2012-05-10">10 May</TIMEX3> .
