Syria crisis : Valerie Amos describes Homs ` devastation ' Baroness Amos -LRB- top left , in red -RRB- spent little <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="PT1H">more than an hour</TIMEX3> in Homs UN humanitarian chief Valerie Amos has said parts of the Syrian city of Homs have been ` ` completely devastated '' .
She said that it felt like the city had been closed down entirely .
Baroness Amos visited the city on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2012-03-07">Wednesday</TIMEX3> , briefly entering the bombed - out Baba Amr district .
Aid teams have waited days to go there , but aid officials said most residents had gone to areas already getting aid .
The government retook the district <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2012-W09">last week</TIMEX3> after fierce shelling .
Activists say troops committed massacres since they entered .
Damascus blames rebels for many deaths .
International media organizations are heavily restricted in Syria , making it impossible to verify the claims of either side .
The rebel Free Syrian Army left the city <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2012-W09">last week</TIMEX3> in the hope , it said , of protecting civilians from further violence .
Meanwhile there have been loud explosions and heavy shelling in Idlib , opposition sources said , amid fears the northern city could become the next major flashpoint as international attention is focused on Homs .
Jim Muir BBC News , Beirut Lady Amos has managed to do something that an International Red Cross convoy , waiting nearby , has been prevented from doing since <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2012-03-02">last Friday</TIMEX3> - to visit the shattered quarter of Baba Amr .
So she 'll have gained at least some impression of the scale of destruction the area has suffered , from <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P1M" mod="LESS_THAN">nearly a month</TIMEX3> of siege and pounding by artillery and tanks .
But much of the superficial damage , the rubble and broken glass , has been cleared away in a big clean - up operation that 's been going on for <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="P3D">the past three days</TIMEX3> .
The Red Crescent volunteers are reported to have concluded that the area remains largely deserted , though Syrian state televison has shown a number of families returning .
But activist groups are still reporting more killings - most <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> , the butchering of two families , of 13 and seven people , including women and children , in nearby farmland .
Such allegations ca n't be verified , and neither Lady Amos nor the Red Cross would be able to check them out .
She 's seeking unhindered access for humanitarian aid to all trouble spots .
What she 's been given so far is very much less than that .
Opposition groups said 39 people were killed throughout the country on <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2012-03-07">Wednesday</TIMEX3> , of whom 26 were in Homs , six in Idlib , three in Deraa and two each in suburbs of Damascus and Aleppo .
The UN says more than 7,500 people have died as a result of the violence in Syria <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="P1Y" mod="MORE_THAN">over the past 12 months</TIMEX3> .
The UN aid chief spent <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DURATION" value="PT1H">less than an hour</TIMEX3> in Baba Amr assessing its humanitarian needs .
She then moved on to other districts of the city , before returning to Damascus .
Baroness Amos ' said there were security issues in the city and that she heard gunfire there , her spokeswoman Amanda Pitt said .
` ` She says that the parts they saw were completely devastated , '' Ms Pitt said , quoted by AFP news agency .
` ` She said Homs feels like a city that has been completely closed down . ''
She was also not being allowed to enter opposition - held areas despite government assurances she could visit the whole country .
The Red Crescent has not yet been able to deliver any aid to Baba Amr .
` ` The Syrian Arab Red Crescent stayed inside Baba Amr for <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DURATION" value="PT45M" mod="APPROX">about 45 minutes</TIMEX3> , '' International Committee of the Red Cross
-LRB- ICRC -RRB- spokesman Hicham Hassan told Reuters news agency .
` ` They found that most inhabitants had left Baba Amr to areas that have been already visited by the ICRC and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent in <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2012-W09">the past week</TIMEX3> . ''
He said the ICRC aid had been delivering aid to other areas where people needed help , including Hama , Idlib , Deraa , areas on the outskirts of Damascus and the eastern city of Raqqa .
Staff from the ICRC were not with them as they were delivering aid to the village of Abil outside Homs at the time permission was given , and it is unclear whether they will be allowed to follow the Red Crescent in .
Baroness Amos has been urging the Syrian government to grant access to battle - scarred cities .
One woman told the BBC 's Paul Wood how two of her brothers were detained , and one was killed She is scheduled to meet the head of the Syrian Red Crescent , Abdulrahman Attar , on <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2012-03-01">Thursday</TIMEX3> .
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallim told her that the government would co - operate with her team and was trying to help civilians , according to Syrian state news agency Sana .
US President Barack Obama has described the situation in Syria as ` ` heartbreaking '' but said US unilateral military intervention in the country would be a mistake .
He said President Bashar al - Assad would fall , as other dictators had fallen , but the US would try to achieve this by working to isolate Syria .
` ` The notion that the way to solve every one of these problems is to deploy our military , that has n't been true in the past , and it wo n't be true <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> , '' said Mr Obama .
The US says it is proposing a new UN Security Council resolution demanding an end to violence in Syria .
Russia and China have vetoed two previous resolutions , saying they were unbalanced and only demanded the government stop attacks .
China , however , announced on <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2012-03-07">Wednesday</TIMEX3> that it had already removed most of its workers from the country .
Hopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir .
