The Syrian city of Homs has experienced days of heavy shelling Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao says Beijing will ` ` absolutely not protect any party '' in the conflict in Syria .
Speaking after talks with EU chiefs in Beijing , he said China would ` ` continue to play a constructive role '' .
China and Russia vetoed a UN resolution on Syria <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2012-02-04">10 days ago</TIMEX3> , sparking claims from the UN rights chief that action against protesters has intensified .
Meanwhile activists say the city of Homs , under heavy attack for <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P1W" mod="MORE_THAN">more than a week</TIMEX3> , is suffering fresh bombardment .

The Local Co - ordination Committees group said that the shelling was ` ` brutal '' and was the worst for <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="PXD">several days</TIMEX3> .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2012-02-13">Monday</TIMEX3> , the United Nations ' human rights chief , Navi Pillay , said the veto by China and Russia had encouraged President Bashar al - Assad 's government to carry out indiscriminate shelling of civilians in Homs .
In a special session of the UN General Assembly , Ms Pillay accused the Syrian government of launching an all - out assault to crush opposition dissent .
She said that at least 300 people had been killed in the assault on Homs , and that the number of dead and injured continued to rise <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EVERY">every day</TIMEX3> .
Mr Wen 's comments came as he addressed a joint news conference in Beijing 's Great Hall of the People with European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso and European Council President Herman Van Rompuy .
He insisted that China remained committed to peace in Syria .
` ` What is most urgent and pressing <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> is to prevent war and chaos so that the Syrian people will be freed from greater sufferings , '' he said .
` ` This accords with the fundamental interests of the Syrian people and also will contribute to the peace and stability of the entire Middle East region .
` ` To achieve this objective , China supports all efforts consistent with the UN charter purposes and principles , and we are ready to strengthen communication with all parties in Syria and the international community and continue to play a constructive role .
` ` China will absolutely not protect any party , including the government of Syria . ''
Mr Van Rompuy said all UN Security Council members should act on Syria .
As the European Parliament in Strasbourg prepares to debate the violence in Syria , a senior Liberal MEP , Guy Verhofstadt , has told the BBC Europe should consider giving weapons to the Free Syrian Army .
But other MEPs , including the British conservative MEP Charles Tannock , say the situation in Syria is too complex and advises caution .
Meanwhile German Chancellor Angela Merkel has praised the Arab League 's stance on the Syria crisis .
Arab League Secretary - General Nabil al - Araby calls for killings in Syria to stop ` ` <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3> ''
Speaking as she welcomed the organization 's Secretary General , Nabil al - Araby , to Berlin , she said the league 's ` ` firm '' position ` ` clearly points out the human rights violations committed by the Assad government '' .
` ` The European Union supports this position and we will underline it through further sanctions , '' she said .
Mr Araby said that the killings in Syria should stop ` ` <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3> '' , and said that the ` ` winds of change '' that had swept through the Arab countries in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2011">the past year</TIMEX3> had been about people demanding what Europeans had had for a long time : liberty , democracy , social justice , dignity and good governance .
Human rights groups say more than 7,000 have died throughout Syria since <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2011-03">last March</TIMEX3> .
The government says at least 2,000 members of the security forces have been killed combating ` ` armed gangs and terrorists '' .
However , Syria restricts access to foreign media and it is not possible to verify casualty figures .
Hopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir .
