Like most Arab leaders , Jordan 's King Abdullah is still grappling with how best to respond to the growing crisis in Syria .
But he is <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> the first Arab leader to openly say President Bashar al - Assad should step down and ` ` make sure whoever comes behind ... has the ability to change the status quo '' .
His candid remarks , coupled with the Arab League 's bold suspension of Syria , are a turning point in the region 's approach to Damascus .
Speaking in a BBC interview during a visit to London , Jordan 's monarch said if the Syrian leader acted in ` ` the interests of his country , he would step down but he would also create an ability to reach out and start a new phase of Syrian political life '' .
King Abdullah still described Mr Assad as a leader who ` ` has reform in his blood . ''
His greatest criticism was directed at what he called ` ` the system '' that did not allow for reform .
` ` I think we would delude ourselves , '' he emphasised , ` ` in thinking that the system would change dramatically if the individual was gone . ''
His surprising candor comes after what he detailed as months of efforts by himself , and other leaders , to engage with an increasingly isolated Syrian president who still insists he is committed to reform .
Thousands of Syrians have fled across the border into northern Lebanon to escape the crackdown The UN says Syria 's eight - month long uprising has cost 3,500 lives , mainly protestors but also members of Syria 's security forces involved in the violent crackdown .
There is been no official response from Damascus yet to the king 's intervention .

A spokesperson for the Syrian embassy in Washington , Roua Sharbaji , said : ` ` the Syrian president only derives his legitimacy from the Syrian people , and only the Syrian people are concerned with this matter '' .
In an interview with the BBC World Service , she said : ` ` We do expect neighbouring Arab states to play a more constructive role to help Syria overcome this crisis . ''
The Jordanian monarch said he had spoken twice to his neighbor <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011" mod="START">earlier this year</TIMEX3> , and also sent his chief of royal court in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-06">June</TIMEX3> .
If Bashar has the interest of his country -LRB- at heart -RRB- he would step down ''
End
Quote King Abdullah of Jordan ` ` It became very clear to me that they were not interested in dialogue with Jordan or a lot of other countries unfortunately , '' he remarked regretfully .
He said the Syrian regime still believed it was in a ` ` fairly comfortable position and will continue to play groups off each other . ''
He said there still was not a ` ` cohesive opposition '' inside Syria because it would be ` ` oppressed very quickly '' .
King Abdullah has also come under unprecedented pressure for political reform in his own country .
There are still no strong calls for an end to the Hashemite monarchy but opposition groups are calling for a stronger , more representative parliament and an elected prime minister .
King Abdullah , who succeeded his father King Hussein in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="1999">1999</TIMEX3> , has been talking about political reform since he came to power .
His critics accuse him of going too slowly and being wary of far - reaching democratic reform .
Asked why his frequent changes of prime ministers and governments - three <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011">this year</TIMEX3> alone - had not resulted in significant reform , King Abdullah replied : ` ` Those who are scared of change , whether it is political or economic , have been very destructive <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P12Y" mod="MORE_THAN">over the past 12 years</TIMEX3> . ''
But he admitted he also had to ` ` shoulder responsibility '' .
As for Syria , beyond calling on President Assad to do more to bring about political change , the king admitted no - one had a clear idea of how to move forward .

Jordanian king openly urges Mr Assad to go ; EU tightens sanctions ` ` If there is a life after Bashar , what is it ? ''
Speaking of leaders across the region and beyond , he said , ` ` the unknown is scaring them more than the known '' .
Mr Assad 's supporters in a country comprising many ethnic and religious minoritieas also cite fears of possible chaos and collapse as a convincing reason to stick with the <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> order .
King Abdullah said concern about instability in Syria was heightened by other regional crises including the ` ` Iranian nuclear file '' and the absence of an Israeli - Palestinian peace deal ` ` which could be leading us into tremendous difficulty in <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2012">2012</TIMEX3> '' .
But he was adamant that no country was seriously considering military intervention .
He warned that ` ` different countries have different agendas ... it would be playing ` Pandora 's box ' '' .
Like all of Syria 's neighbors , Jordan is already giving refuge to thousands of Syrians fleeing across the border .
The king said his country would continue to ` ` open our arms '' to those who had to leave .
Syria is also a critical trade route for Jordan , providing the kingdom with essential goods , including food .
Many tribes straddle the frontier , relying on cross - border trade .
Tension between Arab neighbors can be explosive .
But concern over the consequences of speaking out seems to have been eclipsed by greater worry over the mounting violence next door .
King Abdullah said the Arab <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2011-SP">spring</TIMEX3> was ` ` not even half way through '' .
He expected ` ` tumultuous changes '' across the region for <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DURATION" value="PXY">the next few years</TIMEX3> .
Hopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir .
