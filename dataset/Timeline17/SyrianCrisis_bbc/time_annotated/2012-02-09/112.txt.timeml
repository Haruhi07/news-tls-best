<TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2012-02-09">09 February 12</TIMEX3> 07:00 GMT UN chief Ban Ki - moon says the Arab League plans to revive its mission to Syria , and has sought help from the UN .
Mr Ban said the ` ` disastrous '' failure to agree a UN resolution on Syria had encouraged Damascus ` ` to step up its war on its own people '' .
The international community is struggling to find a way forward in the crisis after Russia and China blocked the resolution <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2012-W05">last week</TIMEX3> .
Syrian forces are continuing to attack opposition strongholds in the country .
Activists say shelling resumed early on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2012-02-09">Thursday</TIMEX3> in the central city of Homs - where the army launched an assault <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2012-W05">last week</TIMEX3> .
With several districts controlled by rebel forces - including many army defectors - Syria 's third - largest city has become a major focus of unrest against President Bashar al - Assad .
More than 50 people were killed there on <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2012-02-08">Wednesday</TIMEX3> alone , according to the UK - based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights .
Speaking at the UN , Mr Ban said : ` ` I fear that the appalling brutality we are witnessing in Homs , with heavy weapons firing into civilian neighborhoods , is a grim harbinger of worse to come . ''
He said Arab League chief Nabil el - Arabi had told him he intended to revive a monitoring mission in Syria , which collapsed <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2012-01">last month</TIMEX3> amid escalating violence .
Mr Ban said Mr Arabi had asked for UN help with the project and proposed a joint UN - Arab League observer mission , including a joint special envoy .
` ` In the <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">coming days</TIMEX3> we will further consult with the council before fleshing out details , '' Mr Ban said .
` ` We stand ready to assist in any way that will contribute toward improvement on the ground . ''
Earlier , the US rejected Russian calls for talks between the Syrian government and the opposition .
White House spokesman Jay Carney said President Bashar al - Assad had missed the ` ` opportunity '' for dialogue .
` ` From the -LRB- earliest -RRB- days of this situation in Syria , there was an opportunity for the Assad regime to engage in dialogue with the opposition , '' White House spokesman Jay Carney said .
` ` Rather than take that opportunity , Assad brutally cracked down on his own people .
We do n't think that that opportunity is available any more .
` ` It is clear that Assad has chosen a path and that choice has resulted in the deaths of many Syrians , including innocent children . ''
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov , who visited Damascus on <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2012-02-07">Tuesday</TIMEX3> , had said that President Assad was ready to talk with ` ` all political forces '' to end the violence .
But his comments were dismissed by opposition leaders and violence across Syria has continued unabated .
Mr Carney said the US planned to meet soon with its international partners to discuss ways to stop the violence in Syria and provide humanitarian aid .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> of intense diplomatic activity , Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said on <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2012-02-08">Wednesday</TIMEX3> that if the UN Security Council could n't protect Syrian civilians , then like - minded countries should find ways to do so .
He is due in Washington for talks with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2012-W07" mod="START">early next week</TIMEX3> .
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev , in a phone conversation with French President Nicolas Sarkozy on <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2012-02-08">Wednesday</TIMEX3> , urged the West ` ` to avoid hasty unilateral steps '' in Syria , Russian news agency Interfax reported .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2012-02-08">Wednesday</TIMEX3> witnesses in Homs ' Baba Amr district reported intense shelling by tanks , mortars , artillery and heavy machine guns .
` ` The situation is dire .
We are short of food , water and medical aid .
Doctors have collapsed after treating the wounded without rest for <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="P5D">five days</TIMEX3> , '' said activist Omar Shaker in Homs .
` ` We want Lavrov to come and spend a night in Homs to see what we have been passing through . ''
The Observatory also reported at least another eight civilians killed around the country on <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2012-02-08">Wednesday</TIMEX3> .
Syria restricts access to foreign media and casualty figures can not be independently verified .
The UN resolution backed an Arab League peace plan that would have seen President Assad hand power to a deputy to oversee a transition .
Russia , a strong ally of Syria , said that amounted to regime change .
The Syrian government blames the violence on foreign - backed groups and insists the Homs offensive will continue until ` ` order '' is restored in the city .
