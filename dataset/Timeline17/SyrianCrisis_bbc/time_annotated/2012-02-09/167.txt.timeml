<TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2012-02-09">09 February 12</TIMEX3> 16:07 GMT Associate Fellow , Royal United Services Institute Pressure is building on the Syrian army with a deepening armed uprising and growing defections .
Shashank Joshi of the Royal United Services Institute considers how the military , the foundation of Bashar al - Assad 's rule , is coping .
<TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011">Last year</TIMEX3> , late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi ordered his army to forcibly crush a burgeoning protest movement .
The eastern part of his army melted away immediately , and <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P8M" mod="MORE_THAN">over eight months</TIMEX3> the rest progressively disintegrated to leave a rump of loyal , family - led units .
<TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="1982">Thirty years ago</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2012-02">this month</TIMEX3> , President Hafez al - Assad of Syria ordered his elite forces to level the city of Hama in response to a surging Islamist rebellion .
Only one brigade defected .
Thomas Friedman - in his book From Beirut to Jerusalem - called this decisive brutality ` ` Hama rules '' .
Hafez 's successor and son , President Bashar al - Assad , is operating under ` ` Homs rules '' - neither those of Libya <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2011">last year</TIMEX3> , nor Hama a generation ago .
Mr Assad 's security forces have been predictably resilient .
A regime built around the Alawite sect has stacked its officer corps with co - religionists , fellow tribesmen , and family members .
The 4th Mechanised Division , which <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> scrambled to regain control of Damascus ' suburbs , is drawn entirely from that sect .
So too is the Republican Guard and influential air force intelligence .
The Shabiha , an Alawite militia , has also been a useful auxiliary .
In short , Syria 's military has been turned into a ruthless confessional militia that is likely to see little future in a post - Assad Syria .
At the same time , no army can withstand stresses of this intensity and duration without suffering problems of morale , integrity and loyalty .

The country 's demography means that only Sunni conscripts can fill up the rank - and - file .
Although the regime has sought to limit their role in combat , a steady trickle of defections has been unavoidable .
The military opposition 's commander Col Riad al - Assad , based in southern Turkey , claims to command 40,000 soldiers in his Free Syrian Army -LRB- FSA
-RRB- .
Gen Mustafa al - Sheikh , the highest - ranking defector so far , has estimated the regime 's combat readiness as having fallen to ` ` 40 % for hardware and 32 % for personnel '' .
He argues that there is a grave shortage of manpower , that Sunni officers have fled or been removed , and that large parts of the army are secretly reaching out the FSA to defect .
Gen Sheikh , who has formed his own Higher Revolutionary Council to supersede the FSA , boldly predicts that ` ` the army will collapse during <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2012-02">February</TIMEX3> '' .
That timeline is highly improbable .
It is as much an effort to garner international support and induce further defections , as it is an objective assessment of regime capabilities .
Even if defections are as numerous as the opposition claims , that would still leave the ratio of government - to - rebel forces as more than four - to - one - a margin of superiority exceeding that seen in Libya , supplemented by militias , and with airpower held largely in reserve .
At the same time , President Assad 's force long ago passed the point at which they could hope for a final , decisive assault like that of Assad senior at Hama in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="1982">1982</TIMEX3> .
The most important factor is the deepening and widening of the uprising <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="PXM" mod="MORE_THAN">over recent months</TIMEX3> .
Those once wedded to peaceful protest <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> judge that taking up arms is the only viable option .
One important milestone has been the outbreak of violence <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2012-02">this month</TIMEX3> in Syria 's second city , Aleppo .
The army is increasingly stretched across fronts that it did not have to worry about <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2011">last year</TIMEX3> .
It took days to regain control of suburbs around Damascus , and the town of Zabadani - scarcely 20 miles -LRB- 32 km -RRB- north - west of Damascus - was entirely seized by rebels <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2012-01">last month</TIMEX3> .
These growing commitments thin out , and increase the strain on , loyal units .
The paradox is that more fighting means more defections , but failing to do so risks conceding territory on which the armed parts of the opposition can regroup and consolidate .
Mr Assad 's security forces do retain some advantages .
Libya taught us that rebel control of territory can be tenuous and easily reversible .
Indeed , Zabadani is falling back into regime hands .
Moreover , the external support to Damascus outstrips anything that might be flowing to the FSA from Turkey , Saudi Arabia or Qatar .
Russia has already sent tons of ammunition , and this lifeline is expected to remain open .
Gen Qassem Suleimani , commander of the elite Quds Force of Iran 's Revolutionary Guard Corps -LRB- IRGC -RRB- , has reportedly served as ` ` chief regime adviser and strategist '' .
The Guardian reports that he ` ` has taken up a spot in the war room '' alongside President Assad and his ruling clique .
There is also diplomatic succor .
Regimes can hold together or fall apart based on perceptions .
Russia 's angry veto of the modest UN resolution <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2012-W05">last week</TIMEX3> sent a powerful signal to those Syrian senior officers of wavering loyalty - Moscow is committed to preserving the regime in some form .
It is rational for officials and groups hitherto sitting on the fence to adjust their loyalty in line with Russia 's apparent commitment .
One hope is that even if President Assad is squeezed out , a Yemen - style stage - managed transition keeps the ` ` guts '' of the regime in place .
Some vulnerable minorities who see Assad as guarantor of their safety , have compelling reasons to take a gamble on this outcome .
A secret US diplomatic cable from Damascus in <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2006">2006</TIMEX3> observed ` ` tremendous fear in the Alawite community about retribution if the Sunni majority ever regains power '' .
Assad 's ` ` Homs rules '' mean that he has no strategy , only tactics : indiscriminate bombardment of a fragmented opposition , the sharpening of sectarian loyalty to force minority communities to pick sides , and outreach to foreign patrons with a stake in his survival .
It is hard to see how this can do anything but accelerate the militarisation of the opposition , induce greater countervailing help to the rebels from frustrated outsiders , and make it very hard for any pluralistic , democratic settlement to emerge from the wreckage .
