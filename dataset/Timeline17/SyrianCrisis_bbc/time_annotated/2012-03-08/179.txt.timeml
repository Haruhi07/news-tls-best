Homs has suffered widespread devastation after weeks of bombardment Dozens of people have been killed in a suburb of Syria 's battle - scarred city of Homs , reports say , in what activists are describing as a ` ` new massacre '' .
Forty - four of those killed came from just a handful of families , the Local Co - Ordination Committees -LRB- LCC -RRB- said .
The reported killings come <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> after the UN 's humanitarian chief visited Homs , saying parts had been devastated .
Meanwhile a Syrian deputy oil minister posted a message on YouTube saying he had defected to the rebels .
Abdo Hussameddin is the highest level political figure to abandon the government of President Bashar al - Assad since the uprising erupted <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="XXXX">a year ago</TIMEX3> .
According to the LCC , the latest concentration of killings by security forces happened in the Jobar district of Homs .
The group said 20 of the dead belonged to a single family , and 16 to another .
It said the deaths were reprisal killings , <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">coming days</TIMEX3> after security forces retook Homs from rebels , having pounded the city for weeks .
The claims can not be verified as international media inside Syria are heavily restricted .
After visiting Homs , one of the first cities to join the uprising <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2011-03">last March</TIMEX3> , the UN humanitarian chief Baroness Valerie Amos said the bombed - out Baba Amr district felt like it had been closed down .
` ` The devastation there is significant , that part of Homs is completely destroyed and I am concerned to know what has happened to the people who live in that part of the city , '' Baroness Amos told Reuters news agency .
Activists said troops committed massacres after they went in to the district , but Damascus blamed the rebels for many deaths .
The BBC 's Jim Muir in neighbouring Lebanon says activist groups continue to report the summary execution of men from Baba Amr , the butchering of entire families , and the systematic mass rape of women .
Our correspondent says opposition groups are urging Baroness Amos to go back and delve deeper .
The UN says more than 7,500 people have died as a result of the violence in Syria <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="P1Y" mod="MORE_THAN">over the past 12 months</TIMEX3> .
Jon Leyne BBC News , Cairo This is potentially very significant .
One of the key elements we have seen in Syria is that the regime itself - the inner core - has not cracked .
If you look at what happened in Tunisia , in Egypt and in Libya , very quickly the regime broke apart and the leadership lost the support of key players .
That has n't happened yet in Syria - <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2012-05">this may</TIMEX3> be the first sign of it , or it may be just one isolated example .
As the deputy minister intimated in his video , anybody trying to defect from that inner core faces enormous pressure .
They fear their homes and families will be destroyed .
In a YouTube message posted late on <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2012-03-07">Wednesday</TIMEX3> , Mr Hussameddin , one of two deputy oil ministers , accused the government of ` ` barbarism '' .
He read out a four - minute denunciation of the regime he said he had served for <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DURATION" value="P33Y">the past 33 years</TIMEX3> .
` ` I am joining the revolution of the people who reject injustice and the brutal campaign of the regime , '' he said .
` ` I tell the regime , which claims to own the country , you have nothing but the footprint of the tank driven by your barbarism to kill innocent people . ''
He said he was stepping aside although he knew that his house would be burnt and his family persecuted by the regime .

The Syrian government has not publicly commented on Mr Hussameddin 's announcement .
Observers say public defections have been rare among civilian officials of the Syrian state , which is controlled by Mr Assad 's minority Alawite sect .
However , there have been high - profile defections from the military , including Gen Mustapha al - Sheikh who fled to Turkey <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2012" mod="START">earlier this year</TIMEX3> .
Also thousands of chiefly Sunni soldiers and conscripts are reported to have deserted since the start of the uprising .
A spokeswoman from the opposition National Transitional Council of Syria said she believed many more cabinet members and their deputies were prepared to defect .
In further diplomatic efforts to halt the violence , special envoy Kofi Annan is due to meet representatives of both sides in Damascus at <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2012-W09-WE">the weekend</TIMEX3> .
Speaking after talks in Cairo on <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2012-03-08">Thursday</TIMEX3> , Mr Annan , joint envoy for the UN and Arab League , rejected military intervention in Syria .
` ` I hope no - one is thinking very seriously of using force in this situation .
I believe further militarisation will make the situation worse , '' he said after meeting Arab League Secretary General Nabil al - Arabi .
Separately , Beijing announced on <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="2012-03-08">Thursday</TIMEX3> that its envoy had talks in Syria <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="2012-W10">this week</TIMEX3> with representatives of the government and the opposition .
China 's foreign ministry said envoy Li Huaxin met Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem and his deputy during a two - day visit .
Observers say Mr Li 's visit is Beijing 's latest attempt to counter charges by Western and Arab leaders that by vetoing two previous UN resolutions , China and Russia have aided the growing violence by Syrian government forces .
Hopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir .
