Syria crisis : Fighting in Aleppo amid rebel offensive A fierce fight began for control of Aleppo after a major offensive by rebels Fierce fighting is taking place in Syria 's second city , Aleppo , say reports , as rebel fighters try to take control from the army .
Pro - government troops are bombarding the city with shells and rocket fire , and there are reports that helicopter gunships are being used .
Activists say at least 33 people have been killed across the country on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2012-07-24">Tuesday</TIMEX3> so far .
Nine of those are reported to have died during a prison revolt in Aleppo .
Syrian state television says the government has <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> regained control of most areas of Damascus which had been captured by rebels <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2012-W29">last week</TIMEX3> .
It broadcast footage showing soldiers apparently securing and checking heavily shelled suburbs in southern Damascus and the bodies of ` ` terrorists '' it says were killed .
But a fierce battle is taking place for control of Aleppo , Syria 's commercial center , after rebels launched a major offensive at <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2012-W29-WE">the weekend</TIMEX3> .
Heavy shelling and rocket fire were reported overnight and into <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2012-07-24">Tuesday</TIMEX3> as the government attempted to take back the seized districts .
Residents and activists told Reuters news agency the two sides were battling close to the historic Old City .
The British - based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said helicopter gunships had fired on several districts of the city .
The BBC 's Wyre Davies , on the Turkish border with Syria , says losing Aleppo would be a serious blow to the government so it is determined to use its far superior weaponry to halt the rebels ' advance .
Activists say at least nine people have died in the revolt in Aleppo prison , where security forces are reported to have opened fire and used tear gas on detainees .
The general sentiment is that everyone here in Aleppo is terrified '' Government officials had previously denied there had been a defection .
The activist group the Local Co - Ordination Committee -LRB- LCC -RRB- said there was a ` ` catastrophic humanitarian situation '' inside the Homs jail .
The group called for international help to prevent ` ` mass executions '' of prisoners .
The Observatory , which said two prisoners were killed at the jail on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2012-07-21">Saturday</TIMEX3> , said it had received reports that a group of judges had been sent to the jail to investigate the uprising , which began over <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2012-W29-WE">the weekend</TIMEX3> .
` ` It is possible their presence might lead to summary executions , '' the head of the Observatory , Rami Abdel Rahman , told AFP .
The group says that , on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2012-07-23">Monday</TIMEX3> , more than 116 people were killed across Syria , and that at least 33 had died by early afternoon on <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2012-07-24">Tuesday</TIMEX3> .
More than 1,260 civilians , rebels and government soldiers have died since the fighting in Damascus and elsewhere intensified on <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2012-07-15">15 July</TIMEX3> , it says .
Foreign journalists work under intense restrictions in Syria so reports by both sides are hard to verify .
President Assad named internal security head Gen Ali Mamlouk as his new head of national security , replacing Hisham Bekhtyar , one of four senior officials killed in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2012-07-18">the 18 July</TIMEX3> bombing in Damascus A commander of Iran 's Revolutionary Guards , Brig Gen Masoud Jazayeri , said ` ` decisive blows '' would be struck against Syria 's enemies , ` ` particularly the hated Arabs '' , if they intervened in the conflict , Iran 's semi - official Fars news agency reported .
The surge in fighting in Syria coincides with widespread concern over Syria 's stockpile of chemical weapons .
Initially three weapons production plants , including Al Safir southeast of Aleppo , which has been redeveloped in <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent years</TIMEX3> Chemical plants said to be active near Homs and Hama from <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="199" mod="START">early 1990s</TIMEX3> Suspected stocks of mustard gas , sarin gas and VX nerve gas from <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="199" mod="END">late 1990s</TIMEX3> Source : Janes , US state department , International Institute for Strategic Studies Both the US and UN gave clear warnings to Damascus after an official said on <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2012-07-23">Monday</TIMEX3> that while such weapons would not be deployed inside Syria they could be used in response to external aggression .
Israel and the US are concerned the weapons could fall into the hands of Lebanon 's Shia Islamist group Hezbollah , allied to Syria 's President Bashar al - Assad , and be used to threaten Israel .
A senior Israeli defense official , Amos Gilad , said the weapons were ` ` under the full control of the regime '' , Reuters news agency reports .
The FSA said in a statement on <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2012-07-24">Tuesday</TIMEX3> that the government had begun moving its chemical weapons stockpile to airports on Syria 's border <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">a few months ago</TIMEX3> , in an attempt to put pressure on the international community .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2012-07-22">Sunday</TIMEX3> , the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that at least 19,106 people had been killed since <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="2011-03">March 2011</TIMEX3> .
The UN said in <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="2012-05">May</TIMEX3> that at least 10,000 people had been killed .
Syria blames the violence on foreign - backed ` ` armed terrorist gangs '' .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="2012-06">June</TIMEX3> , the Syrian government reported that 6,947 Syrians had died , including at least 3,211 civilians and 2,566 security forces personnel .
Hopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir .
