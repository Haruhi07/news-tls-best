Quote Farhan Haq UN spokesman The team , the first Syria has allowed in since the deadly crackdown on protests began , said there was no countrywide humanitarian crisis .
Syria had refused for months to allow a UN mission into the country to investigate the violence .
The government allowed the team in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2011-W33">last week</TIMEX3> , promising full and unfettered access .
` ` The mission concluded that although there 's no countrywide humanitarian crisis , there is an urgent need to protect civilians from the excessive use of force , '' said UN spokesman Farhan Haq .
At the UN Security Council , the battle over what to do about Syria has heated up , says the BBC 's UN correspondent Barbara Plett .
Russia and a group consisting of the US , France , Britain , Germany and Portugal submitted rival draft resolutions on Syria .
The Russian draft calls for the Syrian government to speed up reforms and for the opposition to take part in political dialogue .
The US - European draft calls for a freeze of President Assad 's assets and an arms embargo against Syria .
Russia 's UN ambassador Vitaly Churkin said the Western group was ` ` stirring up the opposition '' in Syria .
Our UN correspondent says there is no immediate plan for a vote on the rival drafts .
Hopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir .
