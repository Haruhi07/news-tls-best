Key events in Syria uprising , <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">one year</TIMEX3> on A coalition of 200 aid and rights groups has called on Russia and China to support United Nations ' attempts to end the violence in Syria .
Their appeal marks <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">one year</TIMEX3> since the first protests against Syrian President Bashar al - Assad .
Syrians had survived the crackdown with ` ` outstanding courage '' , the group said , but more than 8,000 had died .
The UN says it will send a humanitarian mission to Syria <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2012-W11-WE">this weekend</TIMEX3> to assess the situation .
Its representatives will be part of a delegation led by the Syrian government .
They will also be accompanied by staff from the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation .
They will visit a number of towns including Homs , Hama and Deraa to gather information and see living conditions for themselves .
In a statement , UN humanitarian chief Valerie Amos stressed the importance of ` ` unhindered access to identify urgent needs and provide emergency care and basic supplies '' .

Turkey says it has seen a sharp increase in the flow of refugees across its border in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent days</TIMEX3> .
` ` The number of Syrian refugees <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> staying in Turkey boomed by 1,000 in a single day and climbed to 14,700 total , '' foreign ministry spokesperson Selcuk Unal told reporters in Ankara , adding that he expected the numbers to continue rising .
Fergal Keane reports on how Syria 's violence is affecting the country 's children .
Some may find his report distressing .
Among the latest group was a general who had defected from the army , joining the six already in Turkey , said Mr Unal .
Meanwhile , thousands of people have joined a pro - government rally in the Syrian capital , Damascus , to denounce the ` ` year - old conspiracy '' against the regime .
Mr Assad has always insisted his troops are fighting ` ` armed gangs '' who are seeking to destabilise Syria .
In a statement , the 200 aid groups from 27 countries - including Human Rights Watch , Christian Aid , Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies , Civicus and International Federation of Human Rights - called on the Security Council to unite in passing a resolution condemning the Syrian government 's use of violence , torture and arbitrary detention against civilians .
` ` For a full year , the death toll in Syria has escalated to the horrifying total of more than 8,000 dead , including hundreds of children , '' said Ziad Abdel Tawab , deputy director of the Cairo Institute for Human Rights .
` ` Is n't it time for the world to unite behind effective steps to stop this <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> ? ''
Souher Belhassen , president of the International Federation for Human Rights -LRB-
FIDH -RRB- , said Syrians had ` ` survived with outstanding courage <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">one year</TIMEX3> of systematic and widespread crimes and bloodshed as the world stood by and watched '' .
` ` The international community must unite and help Syrians bring an end to the horror . ''
The BBC 's Jon Donnison says video purporting to show security forces looting homes has emerged They said the international community must give its full support to Kofi Annan , the former UN secretary general who is acting as the UN and Arab League 's envoy to Syria .
Mr Annan visited Syria <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2012-W10">last week</TIMEX3> to deliver a proposed peace plan to Mr Assad , and is to brief the UN Security Council on his mission on <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2012-03-09">Friday</TIMEX3> .
The plan includes demands for an immediate ceasefire by both sides , access for humanitarian aid , and the beginning of political dialogue .

Syrian foreign ministry spokesman Jihad al - Maqdisi told the BBC that Mr Assad 's response had been positive because he wanted Mr Annan 's mission to succeed .
Bahrain added further pressure , announcing on <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2012-03-15">Thursday</TIMEX3> it was closing its embassy in Damascus and withdrawing all staff from Syria because of deteriorating conditions .
A number of countries , including the US , UK , Saudi Arabia , Netherlands and Italy have already closed or suspended their embassies .
The UK - based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 20 people , including seven army defectors , were killed on <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2012-03-14">Wednesday</TIMEX3> as the government began shelling Deraa .
<TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DURATION" value="P1D">A day</TIMEX3> before , opposition activists said government forces had taken control of the north - western city of Idlib , after days of clashes with rebel fighters .
Security forces were reportedly carrying out house - to - house searches in the area , which has been a stronghold of the Free Syrian Army -LRB- FSA -RRB- , the main armed rebel group .
Tom Porteous of Human Rights Watch said there were reports that 114 people had died in the Idlib in <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DURATION" value="P4D">the past four days</TIMEX3> .
Footage showing the scale of protests in Syria started emerging in <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2011-03">March last year</TIMEX3> Reports are difficult to verify because of tight restrictions on independent media operating in Syria .
The violence comes <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DURATION" value="P2W">two weeks</TIMEX3> after troops backed by tanks entered the shattered Baba Amr district of Homs , which had been under bombardment for <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DURATION" value="P1M" mod="LESS_THAN">almost a month</TIMEX3> , leaving an estimated 700 people dead .
French foreign minister Alain Juppe insisted that the answer to crisis was not to arm the opposition .
` ` If we give arms to a certain faction of the Syrian opposition , we will create the conditions for a civil war ... and that could become an even bigger catastrophe than we have <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> , '' he said .
The first protest in Syria took place on the streets of Damascus , on <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="2011-03-15">15 March 2011</TIMEX3> , amid the wave of political unrest across the Middle East and North Africa .
<TIMEX3 tid="t36" type="DURATION" value="PXD">A few days</TIMEX3> later , there were clashes in Deraa , as crowds protested against the arrest and alleged torture of a group of schoolchildren who had written anti - government slogans on a wall .
The army was called into Deraa to restore order by the end of the month , but the unrest had already spread to towns and cities across the country .
As the army began firing on civilians , the initial calls for more political freedom escalated into calls for the removal of Mr Assad and his government .
The Syrian government has been trying to suppress an uprising inspired by events in Tunisia , Egypt and Libya .
The UN says thousands have been killed in the crackdown , and that many more have been detained and displaced .
The Syrian government says hundreds of security forces personnel have also died combating ` ` armed terrorist gangs '' .
The family of President Bashar al - Assad has been in power since his father , Hafez , took over in a coup in <TIMEX3 tid="t37" type="DATE" value="1970">1970</TIMEX3> .
The country underwent some liberalisation after Bashar became president in <TIMEX3 tid="t38" type="DATE" value="2000">2000</TIMEX3> , but the pace of change soon slowed , if not reversed .
Critics are imprisoned , domestic media are tightly controlled , and economic policies often benefit the elite .
The country 's human rights record is among the worst in the world .
Syria is a country of 21 million people with a Sunni Muslim majority -LRB- 74 % -RRB- and significant minorities of Alawites - the Shia heterodox sect to which Mr Assad belongs - and Christians .
Mr Assad promotes a secular identity for the country , but he has concentrated power in the hands of family and other Alawites .
Protests have generally been biggest in Sunni - dominated areas .
Under the sanctions imposed by the Arab League , US and EU , Syria 's two most vital sectors , tourism and oil , have ground to a halt in <TIMEX3 tid="t39" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent months</TIMEX3> .
The IMF says Syria 's economy contracted by 2 % in <TIMEX3 tid="t42" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3> , while the value of the Syrian pound has crashed .
Unemployment is high , electricity cuts trouble Damascus , and critical products like heating oil and staples like milk powder are becoming scarce .
Pro - democracy protests erupted in <TIMEX3 tid="t45" type="DATE" value="2011-03">March 2011</TIMEX3> after the arrest and torture of a group of teenagers who had painted revolutionary slogans on walls at their school in the southern city of Deraa .
Security forces opened fire during a march against the arrests , killing four .
<TIMEX3 tid="t48" type="DATE" value="2012-03-16">The next day</TIMEX3> , the authorities shot at mourners at the victims ' funerals , killing another person .
People began demanding the overthrow of Mr Assad .
The government has tried to deal with the situation with a combination of minor concessions and force .
President Assad ended the 48 - year - long state of emergency and introduced a new constitution offering multi - party elections .
But at the same time , the authorities have continued to use violence against unarmed protesters , and some cities , like Homs , have suffered weeks of intense bombardment .
The opposition is deeply divided .
Several groups formed a coalition , the Syrian National Council -LRB- SNC -RRB- , but it is dominated by the Sunni community and exiled dissidents .
The SNC disagrees with the National Co - ordination Committee -LRB- NCC
-RRB- on the questions of talks with the government and foreign intervention , and has found it difficult to work with the Free Syrian Army - army defectors seeking to topple Mr Assad by force .
International pressure on the Syrian government has been intensifying .
It has been suspended from the Arab League , while the EU and the US have imposed sanctions .
However , there has been no agreement on a UN Security Council resolution calling for an end to violence .
Although military intervention has been ruled out by Western nations , there are increasing calls to arm the opposition .
Correspondents say a peaceful solution seems unlikely .
Syria 's leadership seems intent on crushing resistance and most of the opposition will only accept an end to the regime .
Some believe the expected collapse of Syria 's currency and an inability to pay salaries may be the leadership 's downfall .
There are fears , though , that the resulting chaos would be long - lasting and create a wider conflict .
Hopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by <TIMEX3 tid="t52" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir .
