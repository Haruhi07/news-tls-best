-LRB- CNN -RRB- --
Islamists , leftists and union members marched <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-01-28">Friday</TIMEX3> in downtown Amman , demanding more significant economic and political reforms to help struggling citizens .
About 3,000 people gathered in the Jordanian capital for the event , according to national police spokesman Lt . Col . Mohammad Al Khateeb .
Half of those demonstrated , while the remainder walked alongside or watched from the sidelines .
Al Khateeb said there were protests in six other cities on <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2011-01-28">Friday</TIMEX3> , with crowd estimates totaling about 2,200 .
The demonstrations in Amman were the third in as many Fridays , with protesters gathering in front of the Al Husseini Mosque to decry government policies they blame for rising prices , low wages and unemployment .
Middle East to follow Egypt 's lead ?
Will unrest spread to other countries ?
Where does U.S. go from here with Egypt ?
There were also calls for Prime Minister Samir Rifai , who took office in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2009-12">December 2009</TIMEX3> , to step down , and for the dissolution of parliament .

The Islamic Action Front , the political arm of the Jordan branch of the Muslim Brotherhood , is also asking for an ` ` elected government . ''
<TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Currently</TIMEX3> , the prime minister and cabinet are appointed by King Abdullah II .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent weeks</TIMEX3> , the government has announced several measures intended to ease citizens ' economic hardships .
These included reducing taxes on fuel derivatives and effectively subsidizing basic commodities .
The government <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2011-W04">last week</TIMEX3> also announced a pay raise -- 20 Jordanian dinars per month -- for civil servants , military personnel and retirees .
Still , protesters contended <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2011-01-28">Friday</TIMEX3> that the measures do n't go far enough .
Besides their demands of Jordan 's government , those in Amman also showed solidarity with others in the Arab world who have <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> taken to the streets to demand certain freedoms and urge the ouster of their governments .
Chanting , ` ` Egyptian nation , our beloved -- your redemption is near , '' the Jordanian demonstrators spoke to the thousands of protesters in that north African country , who hit the streets <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2011-01-28">Friday</TIMEX3> calling for an end to President Hosni Mubarak 's 30 - year - rule .
