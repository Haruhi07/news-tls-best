Obama has not called Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak -- the target of the protesters ' anger -- ` ` but there is daily contact between the U.S. and Egyptian governments through various channels , including the embassies and other organizations in which Obama 's messages and concerns are relayed , '' Vietor said .
Obama received information on Egypt from National Security Adviser Tom Donilon on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-01-28">Friday</TIMEX3> and will get other updates later .
Servers of Egypt 's main internet provider were down <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-01-28" mod="START">early Friday</TIMEX3> , according to multiple services that check whether servers used by specific sites are active .
Servers for the Egyptian government 's sites and for the U.S. Embassy in Cairo also appeared to be down .
But at least one internet service provider , Noor , was still working .
` ` We are closely monitoring the situation and are aware that communication services , including social media , are being blocked , '' U.S. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2011-01-27">Thursday</TIMEX3> .
` ` We continue to urge Egyptian authorities to show restraint and allow peaceful protests to occur . ''
Obama has urged the government and demonstrators to refrain from violence as protests continued .
` ` It is very important that people have mechanisms in order to express legitimate grievances , '' he said .
Vice President Joe Biden told PBS NewsHour on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011-01-27">Thursday</TIMEX3> that Mubarak should listen to protesters .
He also said the embattled Egyptian president is no dictator .
Still , he said ` ` violence is n't appropriate and people have a right to protest . ''
On <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2011-01-26">Wednesday</TIMEX3> , White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said the U.S. administration was ` ` monitoring quite closely the situation in Egypt and continue to do so , obviously , in Tunisia . ''
The protests in Egypt started after weeks of similar disturbances sparked a revolution in Tunisia and forced then - president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali to flee the country .
` ` This is an important time for the government to demonstrate its responsiveness to the people of Egypt in recognizing those universal rights , '' Gibbs said .
