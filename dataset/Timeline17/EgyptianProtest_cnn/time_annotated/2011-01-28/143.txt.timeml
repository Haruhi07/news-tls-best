Cairo , Egypt -LRB-
CNN -RRB- -- ` ` Freedom ! ''
That word , yelled out in Arabic , reverberated <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2011-01-28">Friday</TIMEX3> along the banks of the Nile River in Cairo -- as well as in the port city of Alexandria , near the canal in Suez , and other pockets of Egypt .
Many demonstrators voicing their desire for a new government and new political future remained on the streets well into <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="TIME" value="2011-01-22TMO">Saturday morning</TIMEX3> , defying a curfew and revelling in a historic day in a nation whose history dates back millennia .
By <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2011-01-22" mod="START">early Saturday</TIMEX3> , police were nowhere to be seen in the capital of Cairo , with military forces deployed on streets all around the nation for the first time in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P3DE" mod="MORE_THAN">more than three decades</TIMEX3> .
They were ordered out by President Hosni Mubarak , whom many demonstrators were urging to step down or , at least , institute dramatic economic and political reforms .
` ` We want -LRB- Mubarek -RRB- to leave , '' said Ahmed , whose last name was withheld to protect his identity .
` ` His time is over , '' the 19 - year - old law student said <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2011-01-22" mod="START">early Saturday</TIMEX3> from Raml Square in central Alexandria .
Egypt 's ruling party headquarters on fire Police fire tear gas at protesters Suez crowds confront riot police Mubarak has been in power for <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P30Y">30 years</TIMEX3> , during which time Egypt has established itself as one of the most important powers in the region and a strong ally of the United States .
At the same time , the long - time ruler and his regime had a reputation for restricting freedoms and staunchly holding onto power .
Resistance in the past had often been stifled by either political manuevering or the police , members of which were out in full force <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2011-W04">this week</TIMEX3> .
But rarely have they met an opposition force as large , or as apparently determined .
` ` Police have always been violent , but we have n't seen it this way , '' Sarah Sirgany , a reporter for Daily News Egypt who has been posting regular developments on Twitter , told CNN 's Piers Morgan .
` ` We have n't seen this many people on the streets at the same time . ''
Video footage from <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2011-01-28">Friday</TIMEX3> showed throngs of protesters charging down a bridge over the Nile River in Cairo , overrunning police trucks that fired off tear gas with minimal effect .
Elsewhere , demonstrators torched and ransacked the headquarters of Mubarak 's ruling National Democratic Party .
When protesters circled the Ministry of Information in Cairo on <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2011-01-28">Friday</TIMEX3> , they were greeted by police , who responded with sharp cracks of gunfire .
It 's not clear whether police shot at protesters or into the air , whether their bullets were rubber or steel , whether anyone was wounded or killed .
There were many other reports of run - ins , and the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights reporting <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2011-01-28" mod="START">early Friday</TIMEX3> that the government had arrested more than 1,000 people , including political opposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei .
Mohammed Mansour , a resident of the Shubra neighborhood of Cairo , said that he and fellow demonstrators had been ` ` beaten and assaulted by police '' since <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2011-01-24">Monday</TIMEX3> , when the popular unrest began .
Continuing to fight <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2011-01-28">Friday</TIMEX3> , he said that his group had beaten back police , who retreated .
Later he claimed , protesters set fire to three police stations and about 20 police cars .
` ` We went out <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2011-01-28">today</TIMEX3> and we were ready to die , so our children can live in dignity , '' said Mansour .
Protesters ' interactions with Egypt 's military -- members of an army that is widely respected in Egypt -- were far more friendly .
In Cairo and Alexandria , many protesters greeted troops with embraces and cheers , some even shaking hands with soldiers .
Mansour , the Cairo resident , said he and fellow demonstrators celebrated when they saw troops roll into town , and they were not alone .
` ` It means we are victorious , '' he said .
` ` If the army comes out , that means the government ... is no longer in control . ''
In the wee hours of <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2011-01-22">Saturday</TIMEX3> , with the curfew ostensibly in effect , people continued to come up to friendly army troops , greeting them and posing for pictures by tanks .
Some military personnel were stationed outside burned out police stations , but did little to prevent people from going into them and coming out with chairs , tables and various valuables .
The army was n't the only side exercising restraint .
The Muslim Brotherhood sent its followers onto the streets after <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2011-01-28">Friday</TIMEX3> prayers , the first time Egypt 's large and venerable -- but illegal -- Islamic opposition called for protest during this round of demonstrations .

And when younger Muslim Brotherhood protesters seemed ready to hurl rocks at the police in Alexandria , Egypt 's second - largest city , older men put their arms around their shoulders , calming them down .
Just after <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="TIME" value="2011-01-22T24:00">midnight Saturday</TIMEX3> , Mubarak gave a speech defending and explaining the government 's response to the protests while saying that he 'd soon form a new government mindful of the demonstrators ' demands for policy changes .
Still that did n't appease many on the streets , who vowed to continue demonstrating again against what they felt was an unjust ruling government that needed a fresh start -- without Mubarak .
` ` We are one of the richest Arab countries , and we want to live , '' said a 20 - year - old student named Mohammed , whose last name was withheld to protect his identity , from Alexandria .
` ` Let a new government form , but if we do n't get what we ask for , we will go back to the streets again and again . ''
Another protester in Alexandria , an 18 - year - old taxi driver named Yousef , did n't even think the entrenched Egyptian ruler deserved even that much of a chance .
He said Egyptians should press on with their protests , following the lead of their fellow African nation Tunisia .
There , President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali left the country after <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DURATION" value="P23Y">23 years</TIMEX3> in power <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2011-01-29">following weeks</TIMEX3> of demonstrations against his rule .
The new government , under Prime Minister Mohamed Ghannouchi , announced new freedoms and promised to institute numerous democratic - minded reforms .
` ` They kept protesting until he fled the country , '' Yousef said of Tunisia .
` ` We will do more and more , we will continue our demonstrations , and we will do 3,000 times more of what the Tunisians did . ''
