CNN -RRB- --
Thailand 's Prime Minister has called on leaders troubled by civil unrest to exercise restraint , <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P1Y" mod="LESS_THAN">less than a year</TIMEX3> after a bloody military crackdown on the streets of Bangkok .
Abhisit Vejjajiva sent in government troops to quell long - running Red Shirt protests in the Thai capital <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010-05">last May</TIMEX3> .
Ninety - one people died and hundreds were injured in the street battles that followed .
But as thousands gathered on the streets of Cairo , Alexandria and Suez to demand an end to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak 's 30 - year - rule , Abhisit -- speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland -- told CNN leaders should respect the wishes of their people .
Abhisit said as long as demonstrators did not resort to violence , governments had a responsibility to restrict the use of force .
` ` When the protesters were peaceful -LRB- when they -RRB- were exercising their constitutional rights , there was absolutely no need for any kind of force to be used .
` ` Unfortunately in the protests in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-04">April</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-05">May</TIMEX3> there was violence -- grenades launched , invading hospitals and so on -- and we had to make sure that order had to be preserved . ''
He told CNN : ` ` For us what was important , we needed to enforce the law -LRB- and -RRB- at the same time , we had to exercise the utmost restraint , and try to address whatever legitimate grievances these people on the streets had . ''
` ` I hope that in a number of countries , they will be able to do the same . ''
Asked to offer advice to Mubarak , the Thai PM said : ` ` He should just respect the key principles of governance , respect the wishes of the people , and at the same time do his duties . ''
Thailand 's Red Shirt protesters took to the streets to call for the return of former PM Thaksin Shinawatra , who was ousted in a coup in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2006">2006</TIMEX3> .
As the demonstrations raged , Abhisit 's government imposed a state of emergency , putting the military in charge of security .
It was lifted in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-12">December</TIMEX3> .
Abhisit has pledged to hold fresh elections before <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2011" mod="END">the end of this year</TIMEX3> .
