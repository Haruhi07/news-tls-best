A transitional government is overseeing sweeping changes in Tunisia after massive demonstrations forced out the country 's longtime president and sparked similar protests across the Middle East .
Under president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali , the news media was tightly controlled .
Internet activity was monitored and access to some sites was restricted .
Police routinely stopped people without cause to check their identity and question them - it was a policy that the government said was needed to prevent terrorists from gaining a foothold in Tunisia .
Tunisians limited what they spoke about with friends and neighbors for fear that someone might be a police informer .
<TIMEX3 tid="t44" type="DATE" value="2011-02-08">Today</TIMEX3> , internet filters have disappeared and there is unfettered access to all websites .
Journalists are learning how to create a free press as they transform their newspapers , radio broadcasts and television stations .
People express their opinions openly in the streets .
Reforms are taking place in every region of the country , which is home to about 12 million people .
The question is , will these changes last ?

With protesters still in the streets of Cairo and newly appointed government officials meeting with some opposition leaders , Egypt faces an uncertain future .
The outcome will depend largely on the course charted by a transitional government .
Many other countries have been down the path Egypt finds itself on .

A popular uprising undermines the authority of a long - standing regime and a period of chaos ensues .
Transitional governments often take control and their success at ushering in change varies depending on a multitude of factors .
` ` In many of these cases , if the military splits or goes against the ruler and helps to bring in some transition with popular support , it still may take a cycle or more to get to an actual democratic regime or to accomplish real change , '' said Georgia State University political science professor Jennifer McCoy , citing past transitions in Latin American , Eastern Europe and the Philippines .
There is no guaranteed route to success , McCoy said , and often , while there may be some wholesale changes , the people in positions of authority remain at the top in transitional governments .
In a case where there is no clear leader or leading group such as in Egypt <TIMEX3 tid="t59" type="DATE" value="2011-02-08">today</TIMEX3> that spurred the change , it s very difficult to predict where it s going to go . ''
Click here for the entire interview : You can also listen to the CNN Radio Reports podcast on Coach Tom Walter donated a kidney to Wake Forest baseball player Kevin Jordan .
Wake Forest University outfielder Kevin Jordan and coach Tom Walter are recovering after surgery at Emory University in Atlanta , team spokesman Steven Wright said .

` ` But the coach did n't really seemed fazed by the surgery .
I do n't think it was a matter of making the decision so much as it was , ` This is how it has to be , so it is . ' ''
Jordan has a rare condition that causes abnormal antibodies to attack white blood cells and damage small blood vessels , the newspaper reported .
Walter reportedly stepped up after learning that none of the athlete 's relatives were a match .
The coach talked to USA <TIMEX3 tid="t64" type="DATE" value="2011-02-08">Today</TIMEX3> before the operation .
` ` When we recruit our guys , we talk about family and making sacrifices for one another , '' he said .
` ` It is something we take very seriously .
I had the support of my family , Wake Forest and my team .
To me it was a no - brainer . ''
Donating a kidney is an incredible act of generosity , but there 's something uniquely remarkable about this case .
The freshman from Columbus , Georgia , has n't even played a game with Wake Forest yet .
Jordan , who was the New York Yankees pick in the 19th round of <TIMEX3 tid="t65" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3> 's amateur draft , had only practiced with his teammates <TIMEX3 tid="t66" type="DATE" value="2010-FA">last fall</TIMEX3> at Wake Forest .
He started school at Wake Forest <TIMEX3 tid="t70" type="DATE" value="2010-08">last August</TIMEX3> , and endured hours of dialysis <TIMEX3 tid="t72" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> while keeping up with the demands of college ball and his school work .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t73" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent months</TIMEX3> , his health began to deteriorate , Wright said .
Next semester , Jordan will take time off at home to recover from the surgery .

But the coach has said he plans to be at Wake Forest 's first game against LSU in <TIMEX3 tid="t76" type="DURATION" value="P2W" mod="LESS_THAN">less than two weeks</TIMEX3> .
` ` He might not be catching fly balls , '' said Wright .
` ` But Coach Walter will be with his team . ''

Will Assange be extradited ?
--
WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange returns to court in London .
He 's fighting extradition to Sweden , where he 's wanted for questioning in a sex crimes investigation .
The 39 - year - old Australian has repeatedly said he is innocent and is confident he will be exonerated .
He has not been charged with a crime .
Assange 's lawyers have said Swedish prosecutors are attempting to discredit him because of his work with WikiLeaks , which published reams of classified government intelligence <TIMEX3 tid="t89" type="DATE" value="2010">last year</TIMEX3> .
The attorneys speculated that if Assange were extradited , Sweden could hand him to the U.S. , which could charge him with espionage , leading to his confinement in Guantanamo Bay prison and his execution .
The proceeding in London should wrap up <TIMEX3 tid="t90" type="DATE" value="2011-02-08">today</TIMEX3> .

There have been no reports of gunfire in Cairo , Egypt , <TIMEX3 tid="t91" type="DATE" value="2011-02-08">today</TIMEX3> , but Middle East expert Fouad Ajami cautions that that is no indication protesters are safe .
He says this is the most dangerous phase of the conflict for protesters because many of their identities are known to security services .
If President Hosni Mubarak 's administration survives , people speaking against Mubarak could face severe consequences , he says .
Ajami is a professor of Middle East studies at the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University .
Meanwhile , the White House 's position toward Egypt appears to be changing , and details are surfacing of abuse that journalists have suffered while trying to cover the protests .
