By the CNN Wire Staff Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah speaks at a rally <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2006-09-22">September 22 , 2006</TIMEX3> in Beirut , Lebanon .
Hassan Nasrallah : Arab regimes have lost the respect of their people Hezbollah leader taunts Egyptian government over support the organization has there Hezbollah emerges as a power as process for forming new government unfolds Anxiety , political division deepen ahead of anniversary of Rafik Hariri 's assassination
-LRB- CNN -RRB- --
The leader of the Hezbollah movement in Lebanon says that Arab regimes have been confronted by popular protest because of their alliances with the United States and Israel .
In a televised address carried by Hezbollah 's station al Manar , Hassan Nasrallah said those regimes had lost the support and respect of their own people .
Hezbollah -- a Shi'ite movement -- has often criticized the largely Sunni - led governments in the Arab world .

But Nasrallah 's language <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2011-02-07">Monday</TIMEX3> came close to promoting their overthrow .
The Hezbollah leader said he had not spoken before about the situation in Egypt because he did not want to be accused of meddling in Egypt 's affairs .
In a taunting reference to the Mubarak government 's claim that Hezbollah has been active in Egypt , Nasrallah said the militia 's friends and supporters there had recommended it should not speak up about the situation .
Nasrallah 's comments come as the people of Lebanon wait anxiously for the formation of a new government .
The Cabinet led by Saad Hariri was brought down <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011-01">last month</TIMEX3> , and Hezbollah has emerged as the most powerful force in a possible new government .
At the same time , tension is growing over the unveiling of indictments said to connect members of Hezbollah with the assassination of Rafik Hariri , Saad 's father , in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2005">2005</TIMEX3> .
Hezbollah has turned on the U.N. Special Tribunal on Lebanon that is investigating the assassination , describing it as a tool of Israel and the United States .
Saad Hariri says his party wo n't join the new government without guarantees it will respect indictments handed down by the tribunal .
Positions are hardening ahead of commemorations of the sixth anniversary of Rafik Hariri 's death on <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2011-02-14">February 14</TIMEX3> .

The daunting task of reconciliation has fallen to Najib Mikati -- a billionaire Sunni businessman involved in telecommunications , construction and other businesses .
He has said he wants to form a national unity government -- and is seeking to accommodate Sunnis , Shi'ites and Christians in government as he negotiates the bewildering alliances between Lebanon 's many parties .
Some Lebanese politicians , notably the veteran Nabih Berri , a Shiite , are talking optimistically about a new government being formed within <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P1W">a week</TIMEX3> .
Others foresee a much longer period of wrangling just as Lebanon awaits the publication of the tribunal 's indictments , which for <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> are sealed .
Lebanon 's old divisions -- Christian against Sunni against Shiite -- are <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> more complex .
Some Christian families , notably the Gemayels and their Kataeb party , are allied with the Sunni Hariri 's party and want to see Hezbollah 's wings clipped .
Besides its political strength , Hezbollah 's militia numbers thousands of well - trained fighters and tens of thousands of rockets prepared for war with Israel .
But another prominent Christian , Michel Aoun , is allied with the Shiite Hezbollah .
And Walid Jumblatt , the leader of the minority Druze community , has deserted Hariri for the pro - Syrian Hezbollah , even though Jumblat 's father was killed by the Syrians .
Aoun was brutally honest about his choice : ` ` We have the choice of stability at the price of justice by going with Hezbollah . ''
In other words , the publication of the indictments and any attempt to follow through with arrests would only destabilize Lebanon .
Many view Lebanon as an emerging battleground between Iran and Syria on the one hand and pro - Western forces on the other .
