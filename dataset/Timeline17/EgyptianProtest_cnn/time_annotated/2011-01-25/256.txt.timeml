People across Egypt took to the streets on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011-01-25">Tuesday</TIMEX3> in demonstrations against corruption and failing economic policies , rallies partly inspired by similar protests that rocked Tunisia <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2011-01">this month</TIMEX3> .
Thousands were protesting in the capital of Cairo , according to the ` ` Front to Defend Egypt Protesters , '' an alliance of lawyers who helped organize the events .
At first , witnesses said , the police were restrained in Cairo .
But later , they said , police fired around a dozen rounds of tear gas on the protesters , and people in the crowd threw the canisters back at the officers .
The group said about 200 demonstrators were in the southern city of Aswan , 2,000 in the eastern city of Ismailiya , and about 3,000 in the northern city of Mahallah .
Protest organizers said they hope to capture the regional momentum for political change set by Tunisians , who <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2011-01-15">10 days ago</TIMEX3> forced the collapse of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali 's 23 - year rule .
The Egyptian government did not issue permits for <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2011-01-25">Tuesday</TIMEX3> 's planned protests .
In an interview released <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2011-01-25">Tuesday</TIMEX3> with state - run al - Ahram newspaper , Interior Minister Habib Adly warned that ` ` the security agencies are able to stop any attempt to attend '' the demonstrations and called the efforts of the ` ` youth staging street protests ineffective . ''
By <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="TIME" value="2011-01-25TMO" mod="START">early Tuesday morning</TIMEX3> , more than 90,000 people throughout the country had pledged to participate in the event in a Facebook group called ` ` We Are All Khaled Said , '' named after an Alexandria activist who was allegedly beaten to death by police .
The Facebook group demands raising the minimum wage , sacking the interior minister , creating two - term presidential term limits and scrapping existing emergency laws that the group says ` ` resulted in police control '' over the people and the nation .
To highlight the role of police corruption , organizers tapped <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2011-01-25">January 25</TIMEX3> -- Police Day and a national holiday -- to hold protests .
Amnesty International released a statement <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2011-01-24">Monday</TIMEX3> ` ` urging the Egyptian authorities not to crack down '' on the planned nationwide demonstration .
The banned Muslim Brotherhood , the biggest organized opposition to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak 's regime , had stated it would not have an official presence at <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2011-01-25">Tuesday</TIMEX3> 's protests , but some of its members ` ` have reportedly been summoned and threatened with arrest and detention '' if they attend and protest , Amnesty International said .
