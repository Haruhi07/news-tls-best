In <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2011-02-07">Monday</TIMEX3> 's Postcard , Amany Eid , an Egyptian woman who was never politically active before , wrote about joining the demonstrations in Cairo 's Tahrir Square .
<TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> we see that Eid is just one of hundreds of thousands of Egyptians who are finding their voices for the first time in their lives .
<TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2011-02-08">Yesterday</TIMEX3> 's demonstrations in Tahrir Square were the largest yet and were relatively peaceful , thanks in part to the Egyptian Army .
While it is n't the army 's intention to help the youth - driven uprising gain ground , Kissinger Associates ' Jami Miscik explains , some of its actions are helping them continue the protests in a mostly violence - free setting .
That leads to the swelling of their numbers .
Eid , who participated in the Fortune - U.S. State Department Global Women Leaders Mentoring program <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010">last year</TIMEX3> , was back with the masses at Tahrir Square <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2011-02-08">yesterday</TIMEX3> .
Here is her report .
- Patricia Sellers
The numbers have increased to the extent that we can not walk without bumping into people .
We had to walk sideways .
Previously , Army checkpoints were to make sure that the protesters do not have weapons or explosions going into Tahrir .
Their role <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> is also to prevent the pro - Mubarak protesters from entering into Tahrir to avoid clashes with the anti- Mubarak protesters .
<TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2011-02-08">Yesterday</TIMEX3> I went into Tahrir from another direction and went through the ` ` citizens checkpoint , '' where citizens check IDs and look for weapons .
There is a physical search as well .
A friend of a friend is a police officer , completely anti - regime .
He wanted to come and protest as well as donate medicine .
At the checkpoint , he showed them his ID ; it has your occupation on it .
It said ` ` police officer . ''
They asked him to leave Tahrir -LRB- as big as it is -RRB-
or he would be escorted by the Army !
-LRB-
No police patrols or officers are there in Tahrir .
-RRB-
He left , to avoid being thrown out or beaten !
He did not utter a word to us or even say goodbye .
