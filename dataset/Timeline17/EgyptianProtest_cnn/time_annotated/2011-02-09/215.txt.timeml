2 men charged in death of Chicago teen who performed in inauguration event .
Ghonim , who <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> refers to himself as an Egyptian activist , describes himself as Head of Marketing Middle East & North Africa at Google on his LinkedIn.com profile .
His identity as a Google employee has helped bring attention to his role in the protests , but he was not in Egypt on business .
