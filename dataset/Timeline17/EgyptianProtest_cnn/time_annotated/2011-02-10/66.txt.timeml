Cairo , Egypt -LRB-
CNN -RRB- -- Thousands of Egyptian workers went on strike <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-02-10">Thursday</TIMEX3> to demand better compensation and transparency in executive salaries , authorities said .
The walkout included employees in the petroleum , railway and telecommunication industries , as protests demanding the resignation of President Hosni Mubarak dragged into their 17th day .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2011-02-09">Wednesday</TIMEX3> , tens of thousands of protesters jammed Cairo 's Tahrir Square , with so many spilling into a nearby compound of government buildings that government officials moved parliament to another site .
The government again sought to portray the imminent threat of chaos if the octogenarian president , Hosni Mubarak , were to end his <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P30Y">30 years</TIMEX3> of autocratic rule by stepping down right away .
Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit told PBS ' ` ` NewsHour '' <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011-02-09">Wednesday</TIMEX3> that the military might have to intervene if that were to occur .
` ` Do we want the armed forces to assume the responsibility of stabilizing the nation through imposing martial law , and the army in the streets ? ''
Aboul Gheit asked rhetorically .
` ` For the army to rule , to step in , to put its friends on the scene , that would be a very dangerous possibility . ''
Could Hosni Mubarak step down <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2011-02-10">Thursday</TIMEX3> ?
Protesters ' mood ` festive ' in Egypt Ghonim :
Welcome to Egypt revolution 2.0
He urged the protesters to adopt ` ` some rationality '' and said the self - proclaimed Council of the Wise , a group of prominent Egyptians from various walks of life , should determine a course of action .
Aboul Gheit told PBS that Mubarak 's interest was to protect the stability of the most populous nation in the Arab world .
That 's why he will not accede to the protesters ' demands that he relinquish power immediately , he said .
` ` He thinks that it would entail chaos and it would entail violence and it would entail also opportunities for those who would wish to act in a manner to threaten the state , the stability of the country and society , '' Aboul Gheit said .
Human Rights Watch has put the death toll at more than 300 since the <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2011-01-25">January 25</TIMEX3> rally that ignited the movement .
` ` Instead of running scared , the regime is fighting back with both words and violence to quash its opponents , portraying the opposition as a foreign - backed , un - Egyptian group of conspirators , '' Human Rights Watch said <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2011-02-09">Wednesday</TIMEX3> on its website .
` ` Sadly , its propaganda campaign appears to be as crude as its actual physical crackdown has been . ''
The protests were largely peaceful <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2011-02-09">Wednesday</TIMEX3> , with demonstrators in one rally composed solely of children who chanted anti - Mubarak slogans .
` ` We want the whole regime to end because they are not making our lives any easier , '' said 11 - year - old Yousef Saeed .
Some of their older relatives said they had brought the children to the square to witness history unfolding .
` ` It is the birth of freedom , '' said Saeed 's uncle , Mohammed Mostafa .
` ` Witnessing this event will engrave in them love of this nation , loyalty , freedom and respecting change .
I want them to be free . ''
But the prospect of freedom was competing with the cost of living as a motivator for some Egyptians , 20 % of whom live in poverty .
` ` Whether Hosni stays or Hosni goes , what 's important is that the youth get jobs , '' said Amgad , a mother of three living <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="PT1H">an hour</TIMEX3> outside Cairo , in the rural town of Fayoum on the Nile Delta .
Her work at a doctor 's office earns her $ 30 per month -- not enough to pay the electricity bill .
The embattled president , meanwhile , went about business as usual <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2011-02-09">Wednesday</TIMEX3> , meeting with his foreign minister and Russia 's deputy foreign minister , state - run television showed .
The unrest extended beyond Cairo .
Two people were killed and others were wounded in clashes with police in southern Egypt , state TV reported .
A journalist said the hostilities stemmed from complaints about a member of the police force in Kharga .
In the northern town of Port Said , protesters attacked the governor 's building over a land and housing dispute , state TV said .
The protesters were galvanized by the tears and words of an activist who was seized by security forces and held for <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="P10D">10 days</TIMEX3> before he was released <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2011-02-07">Monday</TIMEX3> .
` ` If you are true Egyptians , if you are heroic Egyptians , it 's time to step down , '' Wael Ghonim told CNN <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2011-02-09">Wednesday</TIMEX3> in a message directed to the ruling elite .
The 30 - year - old Egyptian father of two administered the Facebook page that is widely credited with calling the first protest .
Ghonim , on leave from his job at Google in Dubai , said he was prepared to die for the cause .
` ` Kidnap me , kidnap all my colleagues ! ''
Wael Ghonim said in comments that challenged Vice President Omar Suleiman to try to undo his efforts and those of his supporters .
` ` Put us in jail !
Do whatever you want to do .
We are getting back our country .
You guys have been ruining this country for <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DURATION" value="P30Y">30 years</TIMEX3> .
Mubarak 's regime said <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2011-02-08">Tuesday</TIMEX3> that it had discussed a number of reforms with leaders of various opposition groups and appointed a panel to look into amending the constitution .

But its insistence that Mubarak 's immediate exit was a recipe for chaos elicited impatience from the Obama administration .
Washington is calling on its African ally to expand negotiations with opposition groups , lift the 30 - year state of emergency and make constitutional changes to bring about democratic elections .
But White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs expressed impatience <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2011-02-09">Wednesday</TIMEX3> with the pace of progress on those matters .
` ` I think it is clear that what the government has thus far put forward has yet to meet a minimum threshold for the people of Egypt , '' he told reporters .
A short White House statement on U.S. Vice President Joe Biden 's telephone conversation with Vice President Omar Suleiman used the word ` ` immediate '' or ` ` immediately '' four times .
Biden ` ` urged that the transition produce immediate , irreversible progress that responds to the aspirations of the Egyptian people . ''
The statement also hinted the White House harbors doubts as to whether the Egyptian government is seriously committed to reforms , referring to the regime 's statements as ` ` what the government is saying it is prepared to accept . ''
Meanwhile , an Arab diplomat said that Saudi Arabia would consider matching the more than $ 1.5 billion in military aid that the United States provides <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="SET" value="P1Y" quant="EACH">each year</TIMEX3> to Egypt if Washington were to cut it .
