Like other regimes in the region , Syria faces political alienation , economic dislocation and corruption , but because it has been the subject of international sanctions , it is beholden to no Western powers .
This separates Syria from places such as Egypt and Tunisia , analysts told the magazine .
According to Human Rights Watch , security services have beaten and detained protesters .

A candlelight vigil in old Damascus for the Egyptian protesters was broken up by people in civilian clothing , and police nearby failed to intervene .

Internet filters have disappeared and there is unfettered access to websites .
Journalists are learning how to create a free press and are transforming their newspapers , radio broadcasts and television stations .
Reforms are taking place in every region of the country , and people are expressing their opinions openly in the streets , something that did n't happen under President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali .
Still , small incidents disrupt daily activity .
The incidents are widely believed to be perpetrated by people who once worked for Ben Ali 's secret police and are aiming to destabilize the transitional government .
<TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2011-W05">Last week</TIMEX3> : The north African nation charged Ben Ali , as well as his wife and several relatives , with maintaining and exporting foreign currency illegally , carrying weapons and ammunition without licenses and inciting armed violence among Tunisians .

The ex - leader fled to Saudi Arabia <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2011-01">last month</TIMEX3> after mass protests that left more than 100 people dead .
Protests there began when demonstrators -- credited with starting the ripple effect of protests across North Africa and the Middle East -- lashed out at poor living conditions , high unemployment , government corruption and repression .
Final results of <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2011-01">last month</TIMEX3> 's referendum show that the southern Sudanese voted almost 99 to 1 to split from the north , leading to what will be the world 's newest nation in <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2011-07">July</TIMEX3> .
An election official said the vote was peaceful and transparent and ` ` not a single person showed up to appeal the results . ''
Despite the vote 's smoothness , violence erupted on the north - south border when Sudanese soldiers loyal to Gabriel Tang , a southern Sudanese militia leader who fought in a 22 - year - old civil war alongside the Khartoum government , refused to turn in their weapons .
Fifty people were killed in fighting .
<TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2011-W05">Last week</TIMEX3> : Already faced with the expected secession of its oil - rich south and charges of genocide against President Omar al - Bashir , Sudan 's government began seeing signs of unrest .

The human rights group Amnesty International said more than 20 people still being held by police ` ` are at risk of torture or other ill - treatment . ''
Observers say that if the country does n't find a suitable end to its political turmoil , it could become a battleground between Iran and Syria on one side and pro - Western forces on the other .
Attempts to form a new government have been complicated by a U.N. tribunal probing the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri .
The tribunal is expected to implicate members of Hezbollah in the killing , which led the group to drop out of the government <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2011-01">last month</TIMEX3> .
<TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="2011-W05">Last week</TIMEX3> : Protests erupted in <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2011-01">January</TIMEX3> as President Michel Suleiman appointed Najib Mikati , a Hezbollah - backed politician , as prime minister .
Hariri initially urged supporters to stage a ` ` day of rage '' and show restraint in protesting the appointment , but the demonstrations quickly grew ugly as gunshots were fired and his supporters burned tires and garbage containers in various cities .
In addition to a promise to lift a state of emergency , the government also cut taxes on sugar and cooking oil and increased the supply of wheat , Time magazine reports .
The moves come after weeks of protests .
The Algerian Press Service has reported that the government is also taking measures to bolster youth employment .
Saad Djebbar , a London - based Algerian lawyer and political analyst , said he is skeptical .
` ` They want to produce some sort of trick that would show that reform is under way , like what Mubarak is doing in Egypt , who appears to be using all of the tricks in the book to avoid being removed , '' he said .
<TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="2011-W05">Last week</TIMEX3> : Responding to unrest in the region , President Abdelaziz Bouteflika said he would lift the state of emergency in effect for <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DURATION" value="P20Y" mod="LESS_THAN">nearly 20 years</TIMEX3> , according to the Algerian Press Service .
<TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DATE" value="2011-01">Last month</TIMEX3> , the country 's largest opposition party called for demonstrations demanding the release of detainees and the restoration of individual and collective freedoms .
Opponents blame the government for a spike in food prices and say the regime has failed to use Algeria 's vast energy wealth to better the lives of ordinary people .
