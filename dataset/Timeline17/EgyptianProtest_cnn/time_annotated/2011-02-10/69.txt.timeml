People wait in front of the Social Services Ministry to get financial help in Tunis , Tunisia .
Credit rating agencies have downgraded the debt of Tunisia , Jordan and Egypt A potentially toxic economic cycle could hurt Arab economies , analysts say Jordan objects to downgrade , may look for more U.S. aid -LRB-
CNN -RRB- --
The turmoil that 's roiled Arab states from Tunisia to Yemen is also creating a headache for those entrusted with reviving economies hard hit by rising energy and food prices , growing public debt and the prospect of more expensive borrowing on the international markets .
Since mid - <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2012-01">January</TIMEX3> , credit rating agencies such as Moody 's have downgraded the sovereign debt of Tunisia , Jordan and Egypt .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2011-02-08">Tuesday</TIMEX3> Moody 's changed the outlook on Jordan 's foreign currency bonds to negative from stable , citing ` ` fiscal and economic downside risks related to ongoing turmoil in the region following events in Tunisia and Egypt . ''
Moody 's said that Jordanian protesters ` ` could use the regional uprisings as an opportunity to express their discontent about high unemployment and the lack of development for low - income groups . ''
Standard & Poor 's , another major credit rating agency , made a similar move .
Jordanian officials are not happy with the downgrade , arguing that their public finances are sound -- Jordan 's foreign currency reserves actually rose <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010">last year</TIMEX3> and stand at about $ 12 billion -- and that the economy may grow as much as 6 % in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3> .
Protests there have been largely peaceful and far smaller than in Egypt and Tunisia .
But after pledging to cut the budget deficit , the government reversed course in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2011-01">January</TIMEX3> with a package of subsidies and salary increases amounting to some $ 600 million , to compensate for higher prices .
International bond markets are wary that governments may try to ` ` buy their way '' out of trouble , in the words of one analyst .
It is a potentially toxic cycle , according to regional economists .
Egypt and Tunisia have already suffered a loss of tourism revenue in peak season , while record - high grain prices and a surge in the price of crude oil have fueled inflation .
Jordan imports 90 per cent of its oil , and faces disruption to its gas supplies after an explosion at a pipeline in Egypt <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2011-W05">last week</TIMEX3> .
Like Jordan , Egypt has opted to spend more on subsidies for the poor .

The <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> street protests , <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> in their third week , have led stores , businesses , the stock market and banks to close -- a further cost .
Until the protests erupted , Egypt had a positive reputation in the international debt markets -- with attractive interest rates for investors , banks that had avoided high - risk investments , a manageable budget deficit and low overall sovereign debt .
Like Jordan , it was working to cut its budget deficit .

But markets abhor uncertainty and the government 's cost of borrowing has risen sharply since the protest movement erupted -- although it has fallen back slightly in <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent days</TIMEX3> .
<TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2011-W06" mod="START">Earlier this week</TIMEX3> , the Egyptian Central Bank intervened to support the pound against the dollar , spending precious foreign currency in the process .
And before the Egyptian stock market closed , some $ 5 billion was wiped off the value of Egyptian stocks in just <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DURATION" value="P2D">two days</TIMEX3> .
In addition , government wages and pensions in Egypt have been increased 15 per cent .
Credit strategists say any labor unrest -- especially at the Suez Canal where a strike began among service workers <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2011-02-09">Wednesday</TIMEX3> -- would put Egypt 's finances under further pressure .
Shipping has so far been unaffected by the labor action .
Market commentators say that international investors are already avoiding Egyptian Treasury auctions -- another is due <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2011-W07">next week</TIMEX3> -- meaning local banks are expected to pick up the slack .
One former Jordanian official told CNN that he hoped the country 's vulnerable economic state and its value to the United States as a reliable pro - Western ally would prompt greater financial support from Washington .
<TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2010">Last year</TIMEX3> , foreign grants -- mainly from the United States and Saudi Arabia -- totaled more than $ 400 million .

But there is pressure on the U.S. federal budget too .
