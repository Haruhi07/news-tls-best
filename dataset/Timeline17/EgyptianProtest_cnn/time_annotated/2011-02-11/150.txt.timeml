Cairo , Egypt -LRB- CNN -RRB- --
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak stepped down <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2011-02-11">Friday</TIMEX3> and handed over power to the military , his <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P3DE" mod="LESS_THAN">nearly three decades</TIMEX3> of iron rule ended by a groundswell of popular protests that began <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-01-25">January 25</TIMEX3> .
In a somber , one - minute announcement on state television , Vice President Omar Suleiman announced Mubarak 's resignation and said the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces will ` ` run the affairs of the country . ''
As Suleiman spoke , deafening cheers erupted among tens of thousands of Egyptians who thronged the streets of Cairo .
It was a moment they had sought throughout long , often tense days of demonstrations -- some of them violent -- that demanded Mubarak 's departure .
It was a moment that many in the Arab world 's powerhouse nation had not dared contemplate .
Chants of ` ` Egypt is free ! ''
and ` ` God is great ! ''
rose from the crowds , dizzy in the honeymoon of their success .
Some waved Egyptian flags ; others honked horns ; still others set off fireworks as they savored the scene .
Two major bridges over the Nile River resembled congested parking lots , and partiers packed streets throughout Cairo .
The state - run Middle East News Agency said some people had passed out from joy and others had suffered heart attacks .
` ` It was a sense of liberation for me , for every Egyptian , '' said opposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei .
` ` For the first time , Egypt has a chance to be democratic , to be free , to have a sense of dignity , of freedom .
So it 's amazing .
It 's just like something we never experienced in our lifetime . ''
A source with close connections to Persian Gulf government leaders said Mubarak , 82 , had fled to the Red Sea resort town of Sharm el - Sheikh , his presidency finished as abruptly as it had started in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="1981">1981</TIMEX3> , when he ascended to power after the assassination of Anwar Sadat .
The repercussions echoed far beyond Tahrir Square as the Swiss government moved <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2011-02-11">Friday</TIMEX3> to freeze assets belonging to Mubarak and his family , said Norbert Baerlocher , a spokesman for the Swiss Embassy in Washington .
Obama : ` Egypt will never be the same ' Woolsey : Next step marks Egypt 's fate Ghonim : Facebook to thank for freedom In a speech to the nation <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="TIME" value="2011-02-10TNI">Thursday night</TIMEX3> , Mubarak had indicated that he was delegating authority to Suleiman but made no mention of resigning .
Disappointed crowds calling for his ouster grew in number <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2011-02-11">Friday</TIMEX3> in Cairo and in other major cities .
By <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="TIME" value="2011-02-11TNI">Friday night</TIMEX3> , the protesters got what they were seeking .
But amid the euphoria , ElBaradei sounded a note of caution .
` ` We have challenges ahead of us , '' said the Nobel laureate , who some believe could emerge as Egypt 's next leader .
` ` I think we need to not worry about retribution .
Mubarak needs to go , and we need to look forward . ''
Amre Moussa , the Egyptian secretary - general of the Arab League , told CNN that the country should focus on instituting reforms and establishing democracy .
Asked how long it would take for the government to lift the 30 - year - old state - of - emergency laws , he said , ` ` The sooner the better ... six , <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="P7M">seven months</TIMEX3> . ''
Asked whether he will run for office , Moussa demurred .
` ` That is not an issue to discuss <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2011-02-11">today</TIMEX3> , '' he said .
` ` The time for such a question will come . ''
Gallery : Protesters celebrate Mubarak 's resignation Wael Ghonim , the Egyptian activist who became a reluctant hero of the revolution but has made clear that he has no interest in becoming a political leader , predicted that history books would describe Mubarak as a dictator .
Ghonim -- a Google executive on leave from his job whose Facebook page is credited with triggering the uprising -- was seized by security forces and held for <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DURATION" value="P10D">10 days</TIMEX3> .
His powerful television interview after his release <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2011-02-07">Monday</TIMEX3> galvanized the protesters in Tahrir Square .
He said he had felt certain that Mubarak would be forced out after a revolt in Tunisia forced that country 's leader to step down in <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2011-01">January</TIMEX3> , and he said he believed the Egyptian military could be trusted to respect the demands of the protesters .
Many protesters had been calling for Egypt 's army , which is respected within the country , to take over as interim caretaker .
<TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="TIME" value="2011-02-11TNI">Friday night</TIMEX3> , they voiced optimism that the military would pave the way for free and fair elections .
Throughout the uprising , the military both responded to the protesters and defended Mubarak 's regime .
It showed signs <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2011-02-10">Thursday</TIMEX3> that it was assuming a greater role when the supreme council met without Mubarak , who was then still the supreme commander of the armed forces .
<TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2011-02-11">Friday</TIMEX3> , it issued a communique stating that Egypt 's emergency laws , used by Mubarak throughout his tenure as president to rule with an iron hand , would be lifted , but only when conditions allowed .
After Mubarak stepped down , a military spokesman appeared on state television , expressing appreciation to the former president and saluting the ` ` martyrs , '' an apparent reference to those who died in the protests .
Human Rights Watch has documented more than 300 deaths since the uprising began <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2011-01-25">January 25</TIMEX3> .
Many of the pitched battles between security forces and Mubarak 's foes unfolded in the same places that were scenes of jubilation <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="TIME" value="2011-02-11TNI">Friday night</TIMEX3> .
But <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2011-02-11">Friday</TIMEX3> 's revelry could not push aside the looming uncertainty over what will come next in the Arab world 's most populous nation and how Egypt 's revolution , which succeeded on the 32nd anniversary of Iran 's , might affect the region .
Events in Egypt may extendfar beyond the country 's borders , Moussa said .
` ` Winds of change are sweeping the Arab world and the Middle East , '' he said .
In Washington , U.S. President Barack Obama said the people of this key U.S. ally have made it clear that ` ` nothing less than genuine democracy will carry the day . ''
He praised the Egyptian military for acting responsibly and said it <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> needs to help ensure a credible transition .
Among other things , Egyptian authorities need to set about ` ` protecting the rights of Egypt 's citizens , lifting the emergency law , revising the constitution and other laws to make this change irreversible , and laying out a clear path to elections that are fair and free , '' Obama said .
But two miles from the White House , at a meeting of the Conservative Political Action Conference , Rep. Ron Paul , R - Texas , said that the United States had invested billions of dollars over the years ` ` propping up that dictator '' and has little to show for it .
` ` Where do you think the money went ?

To a Swiss bank account , '' he said .
` ` It contributed to our debt , billions and billions of dollars , and all we get is chaos from it and instability . ''
A spokesman for Obama 's predecessor said <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="2011-02-11">Friday</TIMEX3> that former President George W. Bush ` ` congratulates the people of Egypt for taking an important and impressive first step toward freedom . ''
But the U.S. government 's applause for Egypt 's step toward freedom and away from Mubarak differed markedly from its previous stance .
At a joint news conference with Mubarak in <TIMEX3 tid="t36" type="DATE" value="2004-04">April 2004</TIMEX3> at Bush 's ranch in Crawford , Texas , he offered support for his Egyptian counterpart .
` ` Egypt is a strategic partner of the United States , and we value President Mubarak 's years of effort on behalf of the peace and stability of the Middle East , '' Bush said .
` ` President Mubarak can be confident in my friendship and America 's partnership as he moves forward to realize the hopes of his people . ''
Just where those hopes would lead was not clear in the heady hours after Mubarak 's resignation .
What was clear was that Mubarak 's imposition of military rule broke with Egypt 's <TIMEX3 tid="t37" type="DATE" value="1971">1971</TIMEX3> constitution .
The constitution allows for only two scenarios for a president to relinquish power .
The first stipulates that if the president has to step aside temporarily , the vice president steps into the top role .
That is what the regime briefly orchestrated <TIMEX3 tid="t38" type="DATE" value="2011-02-10">Thursday</TIMEX3> .
The constitution states further that , if the office of the president is vacated or the president becomes permanently disabled , the parliamentary speaker is to assume the role until new elections can be held .
Those elections , in turn , must occur within <TIMEX3 tid="t40" type="DURATION" value="P60D">60 days</TIMEX3> .
In opting for a third way , which put all power in the hands of the military , the regime in effect rendered the constitution inoperable .
A high - ranking Egyptian military official said the army 's command was discussing whether to dismiss Mubarak 's government and parliament and when the next election would be held .
But some analysts were sounding the alarm over the takeover by the military , which has suddenly become accountable for the nation .
` ` Suleiman 's statement is the clearest indication thus far that the military has carried out a coup led by Defense Minister Field Marshal Mohammed Hussein Tantawi , '' analysts with Stratfor , a global intelligence company , said in a statement .
` ` Egypt is returning to the <TIMEX3 tid="t41" type="DATE" value="1952">1952</TIMEX3> model of ruling the state via a council of army officers , '' the statement said .
` ` The question <TIMEX3 tid="t42" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> is to what extent the military elite will share power with its civilian counterparts . ''
Amnesty International warned that Mubarak 's departure did not mean an end to the police state .
` ` The repressive system that Egyptians have suffered under for <TIMEX3 tid="t43" type="DURATION" value="P3DE">three decades</TIMEX3> has not gone away and the state of emergency remains in place , '' said Salil Shetty , Amnesty International 's secretary general .
` ` Those in power must grasp this opportunity to consign the systematic abuses of the past to history .
Human rights reform must begin <TIMEX3 tid="t44" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> . ''
