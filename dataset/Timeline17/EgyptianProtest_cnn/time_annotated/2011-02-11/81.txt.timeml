Here in Hong Kong it s after <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="TIME" value="XXXX-XX-XXT02:00">2 am</TIMEX3> .
Even on one of my wilder <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="SET" value="XXXX-WXX-5TNI" freq="1W">Friday nights</TIMEX3> , I d normally be tucked up in bed by <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> .

But I m finding it almost impossible to tear my eyes away from the scenes on the streets of Cairo .
Egypt s future is far from secure .
But its present is rapturous , unbridled and ultimately momentous .
No <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="TIME" value="2011-02-11TNI">Friday night</TIMEX3> I have ever experienced equals that which Egyptians are experiencing <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> .
It s not difficult to feel invested in these scenes when you ve spent <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P18D">18 days</TIMEX3> writing Egypt s story without ever really knowing what the conclusion would be .
We don t know it <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> but the unique images we have broadcast on CNN -LRB- horses and camels rushing through Tahrir Square , thousands praying as protesters threw rocks behind them , apparent innocents taking bullets to the head , and Mubarak s none - too - ambiguous podium appearance just <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="TIME" value="2011-02-10TNI">last night</TIMEX3> -RRB- are indelible in the minds of viewers around the world .
We have introduced various players -LRB- opposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei , VP Omar Suleiman and protest talisman Wael Ghonim among them -RRB- , little knowing what their influence might be .
<TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> we watch Egypt come under the guidance of its enigmatic military , and the next chapter will be just as beguiling to behold .
The CNN team in Egypt has done a supreme job in telling this story and in attempting to represent the views of the entire Egyptian population -LRB- anti - Mubarak , pro - Mubarak and neutral alike -RRB- .

And their efforts have been reflected in the words of a man who has influenced developments in an unbelievably News Stream - friendly way .
Between Facebook page creation -LRB- and subsequent detention -RRB- , Twitter updates and a compelling interview with CNN s Ivan Watson , Wael Ghonim has been a worthy human face of this revolution .
And his appreciation is humbling : You guys have played a great role in saving the lives of hundreds if not thousands of people .
CNN did a great job .
You guys deserve a great recognition from the Egyptian people and we are not going to forget your role .
You guys are heroes as well .
You are part of the revolution .
You should be proud of yourself .
Stay with News Stream and CNN as a whole as we follow Egypt s progress to an uncertain -LRB- but certainly intriguing -RRB- future .
It 's hard to fathom how a company like Nokia has found itself in the position it <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> occupies .
It 's not just that Nokia is the world 's biggest handset maker -LRB-
it is -RRB- or the world 's biggest smartphone maker -LRB-
it is -RRB- .
It 's that Nokia used to get everything so right .
How did they manage to get it so , so wrong ?
There are several people in the CNN newsroom and elsewhere who refuse to accept my cynical standpoint on <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2011-12-25">Christmas</TIMEX3> .
I have grudgingly grinned and borne it , despite the following defenses for my dislike : The pressure .
What bright spark decided that <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2010-12" mod="END">late December</TIMEX3> was the time of year when we MUST ENJOY OURSELVES OR ELSE ?
Just because everybody has decided it s the season to be jolly , I must wait longer to get a drink .
I m really jolly <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> .
Pan pipe versions of Jingle Bells on loop in stores and stations .
As far as I m aware , reindeer are not native to the Andes and probably do n't visit .
Which brings me to ...
Secret Santa .
Oh wow , I really , desperately wanted a pair of Bart Simpson boxer shorts .
How did you know ? !
Santa generally .
Lying to children is neither big nor clever .

But while <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2011-12-25">Christmas</TIMEX3> has its plus points -LRB- family togetherness and food chief among them
-RRB- , I can not fathom why anyone would choose to celebrate Valentine s Day .
I m not the cynical one here .
The whole occasion is a cynically conceived and cynically executed exercise in fakery .
Fascinating to see @CharlesHodsnCNN commentate on the # Pope 's resignation as both a # CNN anchor and an Anglican clergyman .

I suppose ` ` Fireworks '' is at least apt .

Well , you ca n't say the soundtrack is n't varied .
<TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> we 're on Puccini 's ` ` Nessun Dorma '' .
