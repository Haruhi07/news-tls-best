Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak stepped down <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2011-02-11">Friday</TIMEX3> and handed over power to the military , his <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P3DE" mod="LESS_THAN">nearly three decades</TIMEX3> of iron rule ended by a groundswell of popular protests that began <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-01-25">January 25</TIMEX3> .
In a somber , one - minute announcement on state television , Vice President Omar Suleiman announced Mubarak 's resignation and said the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces will ` ` run the affairs of the country . ''
As Suleiman spoke , deafening cheers erupted among tens of thousands of Egyptians who thronged the streets of Cairo .
It was a moment they had sought throughout long , often tense days of demonstrations -- some of them violent -- that demanded Mubarak 's departure .
It was a moment that many in the Arab world 's powerhouse nation had not dared contemplate .
Chants of ` ` Egypt is free ! ''
and ` ` God is great ! ''
rose from the crowds , dizzy in the honeymoon of their success .
Some waved Egyptian flags ; others honked horns ; still others set off fireworks as they savored the scene .
Two major bridges over the Nile River resembled congested parking lots , and partiers packed streets throughout Cairo .
The state - run Middle East News Agency said some people had passed out from joy and others had suffered heart attacks .
` ` It was a sense of liberation for me , for every Egyptian , '' said opposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei .
` ` For the first time , Egypt has a chance to be democratic , to be free , to have a sense of dignity , of freedom .
So it 's amazing .
It 's just like something we never experienced in our lifetime . ''
A source with close connections to Persian Gulf government leaders said Mubarak , 82 , had fled to the Red Sea resort town of Sharm el - Sheikh , his presidency finished as abruptly as it had started in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="1981">1981</TIMEX3> , when he ascended to power after the assassination of Anwar Sadat .
The repercussions echoed far beyond Tahrir Square as the Swiss government moved <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011-02-11">Friday</TIMEX3> to freeze assets belonging to Mubarak and his family , said Norbert Baerlocher , a spokesman for the Swiss Embassy in Washington .
In a speech to the nation <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="TIME" value="2011-02-10TNI">Thursday night</TIMEX3> , Mubarak had indicated that he was delegating authority to Suleiman but made no mention of resigning .
Disappointed crowds calling for his ouster grew in number <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2011-02-11">Friday</TIMEX3> in Cairo and in other major cities .
By <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="TIME" value="2011-02-11TNI">Friday night</TIMEX3> , the protesters got what they were seeking .
