Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad gestures during a rally on Tehran 's Azadi Square on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-02-11">February 11</TIMEX3> .
Celebrations in Egypt coincided with the 32nd anniversary of the Islamic revolution in Iran .
But experts ask whether it will allow democratic change White House says Iranian government afraid of any challenges -LRB- CNN -RRB- --
In a few breathtaking weeks , the winds of change whipped from Tunisia east to Egypt and Jordan , bringing down two regimes and putting the third on notice that it must make democratic changes .
<TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> analysts , and a world suddenly focused on the region , are wondering whether those winds will continue blowing east into Iran and bring real democratic change or , instead , amount to only a whisper .
<TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">A year</TIMEX3> and a half after the Iranian regime brutally suppressed the so - called Green Movement , a new test of its openness to reform and patience may come <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2011-02-07">Monday</TIMEX3> .
The government -- which <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2011-02-11">Friday</TIMEX3> said the toppling of President Hosni Mubarak in Egypt ` ` joyfully '' coincided with the anniversary of Iran 's <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="1979">1979</TIMEX3> Islamic Revolution -- has rounded up activists after Iran 's two leading opposition figures called for a rally <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2011-02-07">Monday</TIMEX3> in support of the uprisings in North Africa and the Middle East .
From all appearances , the regime is not about to loosen its grip .

And , unlike Mubarak , it wo n't be caught off - guard by the zeal of protesters .
Danger of chaos in Egypt ?
Zakaria : Egypt events have ` huge impact ' Obama : ` Egypt will never be the same ' The Obama White House and some observers say Iran may not be as confident as it appears about demonstrations .
` ` They are scared , '' press secretary Robert Gibbs said <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2011-02-11">Friday</TIMEX3> hours after Mubarak stepped down .
` ` That 's why they threatened to kill anybody that tries to do this .
That 's why they have shut off all measure of communication . ''
Iranian authorities on <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2011-02-09">Wednesday</TIMEX3> warned against any attempt by the opposition movement to hold the rally , according to the state - run Islamic Republic News Agency .
It was unclear whether people will take to the streets , anyway .
` ` We definitely see them as enemies of the revolution and spies , and we will confront them with force , '' Revolutionary Guard Cmdr .
Hossein Hamedani told IRNA .

The Iranian regime on <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2011-02-11">Friday</TIMEX3> celebrated the <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="1979">1979</TIMEX3> revolution that dethroned the shah .
Opposition leaders Mehdi Karroubi and Mir Hossein Moussavi asked that the rally take place in Tehran 's Azadi Square , the site of mass protests by Iran 's opposition movement after the disputed 2009 presidential elections .
The International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran , based in the United States , called <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2011-02-11">Friday</TIMEX3> for an end to restrictions on the movements of Karroubi and Moussavi .
` ` The -LRB- Iranian -RRB- government is doing all it can to intimidate Iranians and deny their right to peaceful assembly , '' the U.S.-based group said in a statement .
` ` With <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> events in Egypt , we see another round of repression in Iran aimed at silencing a people frustrated and dissatisfied by the denial of their human rights . ''
Observers point to an interesting synergy between protests in Iran and Egypt .
They are waiting to see if what 's transpired in Egypt will ignite a substantial renewal of protests in Iran .
` ` I think that 's a very substantial possibility , '' Joshua Muravchik , a fellow at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies , told CNN <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2011-02-11">Friday</TIMEX3> .
` ` I think that the Green Movement in part inspired what has happened in Egypt .
Obviously , Tunisia is the most <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> inspiration . ''
` ` In <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2009-06">June 2009</TIMEX3> , when the Green Movement emerged , the internet was full of chatter by Egyptians sort of beating their breast saying , ` Why are we so lame ?
Look at that : a million Iranians out on the street standing up to their government .
Why ca n't we do that ? ' ''
` ` And that sort of stuck with them -LRB-
Egyptians -RRB- , I believe , '' said Muravchik .
` ` They kept having these small demonstrations and somehow it finally started to gather momentum and the snowball turned quickly into an avalanche . ''
` ` There 's no guarantee though that it will work in the reverse direction , '' he said , referring to Iran .
The disputed <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3> presidential election sparked widespread outrage within the Islamic republic , thrusting the depths of Iranian society into the global spotlight and inciting violence that had n't been seen in decades .
Iran quelled the demonstrations with a brutal crackdown against the peaceful street protests and the arrests of hundreds of activists , reformists and opposition figures .
A diverse opposition movement -- headed by reform candidates Moussavi and Karroubi -- grew into <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2011-02-11">today</TIMEX3> 's Green Movement , protesting for social justice , freedom and democracy .
Experts interviewed by CNN said they believe Jordan , Bahrain and Yemen will likely see significant democratic changes before Iran , and each face different circumstances .
The United States on <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="2011-02-11">Friday</TIMEX3> slammed Iran 's ` ` hypocrisy '' for arresting opposition figures and the blocking of world media outlets and websites .
` ` For all of its empty talk about Egypt , the government of Iran should allow the Iranian people the same universal right to peacefully assemble , demonstrate and communicate in Tehran that the people are exercising in Cairo , '' National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor said .
Iranian leaders praised the Egyptian and Tunisian uprisings and said they were reminiscent of the <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="1979">1979</TIMEX3> Iranian revolution that toppled the shah and ushered in a hard - line and theocratic Islamic republic .
Abbas Milani , director of Iranian Studies at Stanford University , said the Middle East is at a ` ` crucial tipping point . ''
If democratic voices and a government prevail in Egypt , he told CNN , Iran will feel an uptick in internal pressure to reform .
But , he and others said , there is a singular difference between Egypt and Iran .
The Egyptian military , while key to power in the country , did not clash with its citizens .
Iran 's Revolutionary Guard Corps -LRB- IRGC -RRB- was established after the Islamic Revolution to defend the regime against all threats .
The IRGC and its ` ` thugs '' have repressed Iranians , Milani said .
The Iranian military is not as well equipped and as politically oriented as the IRGC and played little , if any , part in the <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3> crackdown .
` ` I think they knew the military could not be depended upon '' because they might side with protesters , Milani said of the Iranian government .
The IRGC has ` ` expanded far beyond its original mandate , '' according to the Council on Foreign Relations , a U.S. foreign policy research center .
` ` <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="2011-02-11">Today</TIMEX3> the guard has evolved into a socio - military - political - economic force with influence reaching deep into Iran 's power structure , '' the CFR says , noting that several <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> and former IRGC members have been appointed to positions as ambassadors , mayors , undersecretaries , provincial governors and cabinet ministers .
Mohamad Bazzi , adjunct senior fellow for Middle Eastern Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations , said the IRGC will stand behind President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who helped consolidate their influence .
And Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has shown no signs of abandoning Ahmadinejad , Bazzi said .
Milani does n't expect the Iranian regime to allow large protests , but he believes ` ` major changes '' and an ` ` unstoppable democratic wind '' eventually will come to the republic .
Iran also must address significant economic problems , he added .
` ` The Iranian society has profoundly changed , ` ` he said .
` ` The regime has not . ''
Ali Alfoneh , a resident fellow at the conservative but non - partisan American Enterprise Institute , said he does n't expect to see major reforms in Iran , at least in the short term , but he believes dissidents were heartened by the Egyptian revolution .
` ` The Green Movement was almost dead and it has become energized , '' he told CNN <TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="DATE" value="2011-02-11">Friday</TIMEX3> .

Rapid changes in Egypt and the region make it difficult to predict what might happen in Iran , Bazzi said .
` ` Surviving the last round -LRB- of protests -RRB- strengthened the regime 's hand , '' he said .
The suppression ` ` put fear in the protesters , '' he said .
To succeed , the Green Movement will have to reach out to opponents and ` ` to the millions who are silent , '' said Bazzi , a member of the faculty at New York University .
Real change may not occur until the next presidential election , he said .
Still , the Iranian regime is probably somewhat concerned after what happened in Egypt .
` ` They are crushing anything that moves , '' Bazzi said .
Isobel Coleman , a senior fellow for U.S. foreign policy at the Council for Foreign Relations , said one big difference between Iran and Egypt are their economies .
Iran has a lot of oil , and it can afford to be ` ` more reactionary and revolutionary . ''
Meanwhile , the Obama administration will continue to pressure Iran over its nuclear program , human rights and influence with militant organizations that threaten Israel , among other governments .
Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin on <TIMEX3 tid="t39" type="DATE" value="2011-02-11">Friday</TIMEX3> questioned the White House 's handling of Iran .
` ` Media : ask ` ` Will Obama Admin exert as much ` constructive ' pressure on Iranian govt to change & allow freedom -- as they just did for Egypt ?
, '' she wrote on her Twitter account .
As the world turns its attention to Iran , especially in the <TIMEX3 tid="t40" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">coming days</TIMEX3> , questions remain on whether governments can change and still hold on to power .
` ` The experience of <TIMEX3 tid="t42" type="DATE" value="2011-02-10">the last days</TIMEX3> shows it is almost impossible to ask for democracy and not ask for a regime change , '' he said .
