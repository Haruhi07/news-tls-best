during Mubarak speech Cairo , Egypt -LRB- CNN -RRB- --
Major Egyptian opposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei warned of potential violent unrest after President Hosni Mubarak announced <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-02-10" mod="END">late Thursday</TIMEX3> he would not step down before <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-09">September</TIMEX3> elections .
Mubarak ` ` is gambling with his country '' in order to stay at the helm , ElBaradei told CNN 's Wolf Blitzer .
He reiterated the message of his Twitter account , which read , ` ` Egypt will explode .
Army must save the country <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> . ''
Major clashes between the people and the army , which Egyptians traditionally believe has been on their side , would be devastating , said ElBaradei , a Nobel Peace Prize winner and former director of the International Atomic Energy Agency .
Hosni Mubarak : I am not leaving Egypt Official : Mubarak to yield power to VP ElBaradei 's outlook had changed since hours before , when Egyptians , including thousands packed in Cairo 's Tahrir Square , expected Mubarak to step down rather than delegate powers to Vice President Omar Suleiman .
The arrangement failed to mollify opposition leaders or those who have rallied in Tahrir Square for <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P2W" mod="MORE_THAN">more than two weeks</TIMEX3> .
Another mass protest is planned again <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2011-02-11">Friday</TIMEX3> after prayer services .
` ` Mubarak is only one part of this regime , '' human rights activist Gigi Ibrahim , one of the Tahrir Square protesters , told CNN .
` ` People have been here for <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P17D">17 days</TIMEX3> , and they are not for Suleiman , either , '' Ibrahim said .
` ` Mubarak has lost all legitimacy , and <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> him handing over the power to the vice president is as illegitimate as Mubarak being in power . ''
ElBaradei told CNN that Egyptians will not accept the new arrangement .
` ` Suleiman is considered to be an extension of Mubarak .
Neither of them is acceptable to the people , '' he said .
` ` For the sake of their country , they should go . ''
ElBaradei said a leadership council and a caretaker government should rule the North African nation for <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">one year</TIMEX3> during a transition to a more democratic process .
Mubarak 's defiant remarks about foreign intervention , and his determination to see the transition through , was not what most in the Tahrir Square crowd wanted to hear .
many chanted as he spoke .
After the speech , parliamentary speaker Ahmed Fathi Srour told state - run Nile TV that Mubarak 's move had put the authority for the day - to - day running of the government in Suleiman 's hands .
The vice president referred to <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="P2W">the past two weeks</TIMEX3> as the ` ` revolution of the young people . ''
Suleiman told the protesters to go home and back to work .
That had not happened by <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2011-02-11" mod="START">early Friday</TIMEX3> .

In his words Yaser Fathi , one of the organizers of a post - speech protest in the northern city of Alexandria , told CNN hundreds of demonstrators marched to an Egyptian military base .
They asked the armed forces to intervene and shouted that ` ` the military must step in to get Mubarak out , '' Fathi said .
Khalid Abdalla , a demonstrator in Tahrir Square and star of the motion picture ` ` The Kite Runner , '' said <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2011-02-11" mod="START">early Friday</TIMEX3> that it 's ` ` an incredibly sad moment <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3> . ''
` ` Everyone 's lost , '' the actor said .
` ` People are trying to work out what more they can do . ''
Egyptian journalist , writer and blogger Ethar El - Katatney , appearing on CNN 's ` ` Parker Spitzer '' <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="TIME" value="2011-02-10TNI">Thursday night</TIMEX3> , likened Mubarak 's speech to American television 's ` ` Father Knows Best . ''
His earlier speech announcing he would step down in <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2011-09">September</TIMEX3> had gained him some empathy , she said .
El - Katatney said she was worried that <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2011-02-11">Friday</TIMEX3> could be ` ` bloody '' because of the people 's frustration .
Nobel laureate Ahmed Zewail , a potential Egyptian presidential candidate , said he sees ` ` several different scenarios '' through which a transition could take place .
` ` The important thing is that the army will protect this transition until a new Constitution is in place , '' Zewail told CNN before the Mubarak speech .
` ` I am very much appreciative of the fact that armed forces are controlling what 's going on . ''
Freed cyberactivist Wael Ghonim , who emerged as a reluctant hero of Egypt 's uprising , had seemed pleased with just the prospect of Mubarak leaving office .
He is on leave from his marketing job with the search engine Google in Dubai and was held for <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DURATION" value="P10D">10 days</TIMEX3> during the protests .
` ` Revolution 2.0 : Mission Accomplished , '' Ghonim wrote on his Twitter account <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2011-02-10" mod="START">earlier Thursday</TIMEX3> , before Mubarak 's speech .
