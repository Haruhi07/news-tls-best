-LRB- CNN -RRB- --
For <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P30Y" mod="LESS_THAN">nearly 30 years</TIMEX3> , one man dominated Egypt .
Hosni Mubarak , 82 , survived would - be assassins and ill health , crushed a rising Islamist radical movement , and maintained the peace with neighboring Israel that got his predecessor killed .
His government 's continued observance of the Camp David accords was the cornerstone of what peace has been achieved in the decades - long Arab - Israeli conflict .
But following the revolt that toppled Tunisia 's longtime strongman , demonstrators in the streets of Cairo stood up to riot police , chanting , ` ` Mubarak , Saudi Arabia is waiting for you . ''
Ultimately , the demonstrations helped bring down the man critics called Egypt 's last pharaoh .
Mubarak decided <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2011-02-11">Friday</TIMEX3> to step down , Vice President Omar Suleiman said on state television .
<TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> that Mubarak is finally exiting the political stage , the debate over his legacy is growing louder .
Longtime observers of the region say the stability Mubarak purchased for <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P3DE" mod="LESS_THAN">nearly three decades</TIMEX3> came at the cost of entrenched poverty and repression in the Arab world 's most populous nation .
` ` Egypt is a broken country , '' Fawaz Gerges , a professor of Middle Eastern relations at the London School of Economics , told CNN .
` ` It used to be the jewel of the Middle East .
It 's the capital of its cultural production . ''
But <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> , Gerges said , ` ` Egyptians have no outlets .
They do n't feel that they have a sense of hope for the future . ''
Mubarak was a Soviet - trained pilot who was chief of staff of Egypt 's air force during the <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="1973">1973</TIMEX3> Mideast war .
The early success of Egyptian pilots against Israel made him a national hero , and then - President Anwar Sadat made him vice president in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="1975">1975</TIMEX3> .
<TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="1981">Six years later</TIMEX3> , Sadat died in a hail of gunfire at a military parade , killed by Islamic militants from within the army 's own ranks after he took the dramatic step of making peace with Israel .
Upon assuming office , one of Mubarak 's first acts was to declare a state of emergency that barred unauthorized assembly , restricted freedom of speech and allowed police to jail people indefinitely .
He made extensive use of those powers in the ensuing decades .
The Egyptian army put down riots by disgruntled police officers in <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="1986">1986</TIMEX3> , and he threw an estimated 30,000 people in jail when jihadists carried out a string of attacks on tourists .
` ` He pretty much wiped them out , '' University of Michigan Professor of History Juan Cole said .
` ` It 's not an accident that they were in Afghanistan instead of Egypt . ''
The government penetrated opposition movements so thoroughly that ` ` if five people -LRB- sat -RRB- down to plot something , the fifth person -LRB- wrote -RRB- a report to Hosni Mubarak about it , '' he said .
The result was ` ` a regime that has very little legitimacy , but presents itself as something there 's no point in trying to change , '' said Nathan Brown , a professor of Middle Eastern politics at George Washington University in Washington .
But Brown said the <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2011-01-14">January 14</TIMEX3> overthrow of Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali , who fled to Saudi Arabia after <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DURATION" value="P23Y">23 years</TIMEX3> in power , changed the thinking of many in the region .
` ` I think what the events in Tunisia did was take that sense that nothing could ever change and lead a few people to question it , '' he said .
Mubarak headed off a similar movement in <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2005">2005</TIMEX3> , when Egyptians mounted large - scale protests to demand fundamental and widespread reform .
He intimidated the leaders of the officially banned but tolerated Muslim Brotherhood , harassed middle - class demonstrators and managed to pick off the leadership of those protests , Brown said .
But the most <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> protest movement had ` ` no real leadership , so it -LRB- could n't -RRB- be decapitated the same way , '' Brown noted .
Mubarak won four terms as president in elections that were considered formalities .
His fifth , in <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2005">2005</TIMEX3> , was Egypt 's first multi - party presidential vote , but it was widely criticized as a ` ` sham , '' Cole said .
Meanwhile , the country 's economy stagnated for the first <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DURATION" value="P20Y">20 years</TIMEX3> of Mubarak 's rule .
Development picked up in <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="200">the last decade</TIMEX3> , fueled by a move away from state control and by billions in tourist dollars , but gains were ` ` very unevenly distributed , '' Gerges said .
About 40 % of Egyptians <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> live in poverty , he noted .
The aging autocrat escaped at least two assassination attempts , including a close call in <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="1995">1995</TIMEX3> when Islamic militants opened fire on his motorcade at a pan - African conference in Ethiopia .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent years</TIMEX3> , Mubarak had several bouts of illness but never picked a vice president .
He was widely believed to have anointed his son Gamal as his successor , but later insisted he never intended for his son to take power .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="2003">2003</TIMEX3> , Mubarak collapsed while delivering a televised speech to the Egyptian parliament -- returning later to blame his illness on the flu .
He had back surgery in Germany in <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="2004">2004</TIMEX3> , returning in <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3> to have his gall bladder removed .
He largely withdrew from public view in <TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent years</TIMEX3> .
His domestic political situation was closely watched overseas , particularly in the United States .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t39" type="DATE" value="200">the past decade</TIMEX3> , Egypt has been a major player in Israeli - Palestinian peace talks , and it contributed troops to the U.S.-led coalition that drove Iraq out of Kuwait in <TIMEX3 tid="t38" type="DATE" value="1991">1991</TIMEX3> .
It receives about $ 1.3 billion in military aid from Washington <TIMEX3 tid="t42" type="SET" value="P1Y" quant="EVERY">every year</TIMEX3> -- second only to Israel -- and has received nearly $ 30 billion in economic aid since <TIMEX3 tid="t40" type="DATE" value="1975">1975</TIMEX3> , according to State Department figures .
But it opposed the U.S. invasion of Iraq in <TIMEX3 tid="t43" type="DATE" value="2003">2003</TIMEX3> , and while sticking with Camp David , Egypt 's ties with Israel amount to a ` ` cold peace , '' Cole said .
President Barack Obama said <TIMEX3 tid="t44" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> that Mubarak was ` ` very helpful on a range of tough issues , '' but prodded the Egyptian leader to take steps toward reform .
` ` You can see these pent - up frustrations that are being displayed on the streets , '' Obama said .
He urged the Egyptian government to avoid resorting to violence to put down the <TIMEX3 tid="t45" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> demonstrations , adding , ` ` I think it 's very important that people have mechanisms in order to express legitimate grievances . ''
Gerges said the Middle East has seen ` ` the barrier of fear '' removed since the events in Tunisia .
` ` Arabs really no longer feel terrified of the security apparatus '' in Egypt and elsewhere , he said .
` ` We 're going to have a new era of politics . ''
