ET -RRB- Egyptian Vice President Omar Suleiman says blame for some of the unrest in Egypt goes to the media .
` ` I actually blame certain friendly nations who have television channels , they are not friendly at all , who have intensified the youth against the nation and the state , '' Suleiman told state - run Nile TV .
` ` They are actually continuing .
They have filled in the minds of the youth with wrongdoings , with allegations , and this is unacceptable . ''
A change in Egypt is necessary but Obama repeats exactly the mistakes of Carter in Iran in <TIMEX3 tid="t165" type="DATE" value="1979">1979</TIMEX3> .
These mistakes result in the poor situation of the Iranian people , in the Iran -- Irak war then , and will cause simmilar results in the Arab world and the Israli -- Palestinian coflict <TIMEX3 tid="t166" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> .
It is easier to throw nice words than to solve the problems of Egypt which produces 1 million mouths to feed and supply new jobs <TIMEX3 tid="t167" type="SET" value="P1Y" quant="EVERY">every year</TIMEX3> .
A process of change should be gradual and controlled under the supervision of the army and the help of Western Powers .

I do n't understand why the death toll started over .
I guess the first 300 do n't count .
For all the people that say if Mubarak left it would be chaos and he should stay till <TIMEX3 tid="t175" type="DATE" value="2011-09">September</TIMEX3> . .
What if he had a heart attack and died ?

After all he is 82 !
And for all the people that say its just 6 - <TIMEX3 tid="t178" type="DURATION" value="P7M">7 months</TIMEX3> , just leave him till <TIMEX3 tid="t176" type="DATE" value="2011-09">September</TIMEX3> . .
If you are an owner of a business and your appointed manager killed your son will you still be able to honor your employment contract with him till it ends ? !
Egyptians want real democracy . .
Please respect that , and try to understand that the whole world does n't revolve around USA .
We are a peaceful nation that wants freedom , we do n't want war nor chaos .
If you ' ve actually saw any pictures for Tahrir square you 'll find that the people of the revolution are the men , women , youth , elders , as well as children of the Egyptian Society .
and besides mike only few accept differences mostly will never . .
try to realize most of us were assertive , selfish , opinionated and this particular feeling is very provocative .
I think we americans need to just keep our noses out of other countrys buisness , stop giving out money to fund wars and fix the problems we have in our own country first .
If money is so tough and the goverment is having to cut school funding and other important things we do nt have the money to support a war which has nothing to do with us .
