Egypt always was a nation , certainly before us - but they are throwing away their heritage -- I guess the mob mentality is human nature ...
such an incredible shame and loss to us all .

@Alj ... ...
Yes most societies have become notorius for their disposable ways .
There are many organizations that are more than happy to take what you consider trash .
The antiquities of past should be protected .
I am full support of change needed in countries living under corrupt governments , but such true treasures should not be put in harms way .
The peoples need to realize that this items can not be replaced and are a gatewway to the past .
Also the killing of others will never help either side as these individuals are not and should not be considerd ` ` disposable or trash '' .
I also realize that many feel that the life of Mubarak could be grouped as such .
@Tomcat , do YOU group the life of Mubarak as trash .
