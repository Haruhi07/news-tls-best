The Egyptian people are not buying what Hosni Mubarak is selling .
In fact , the anti - government protesters have only become more emboldened since Mubarak 's announcement that he 'll step down from the presidency - but not until <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2010-09">September</TIMEX3> .
But they want him gone <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> .
They think <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P30Y">30 years</TIMEX3> is long enough .
However , that does n't seem to matter much to Mubarak .
He told ABC 's Christiane Amanpour that he 's sick of being president and would like to leave office <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> .
But he says he ca n't for fear of the country slipping into chaos .
That 's as opposed to what we 're seeing in the streets of Cairo <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3> .
As for the people shouting insults at him , Mubarak says , ` ` I do n't care what people say about me .
<TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Right now</TIMEX3> I care about my country , I care about Egypt . ''
<TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2011-W05" mod="START">Earlier this week</TIMEX3> , President Obama seemed to suggest Mubarak step down sooner rather than later , saying an orderly transition to a new regime ` ` must begin <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> . ''
U.S. officials say the protest movement is n't going away - it 's only getting bigger .
They worry that the longer the crisis goes on without a resolution , the worse the economic impact and violence will become .
Already there are food and fuel shortages and bank closures .
Other world leaders have also called on Mubarak to step aside , including Turkey 's prime minister , who says Mubarak should ` ` satisfy the people 's desire for change '' without hesitation .
Others are suggesting an interim ` ` caretaker government '' that could oversee the upcoming elections .
Here s my question to you : Should Mubarak be forced out <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> rather than waiting until his term expires in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2011-09">September</TIMEX3> ?

The Middle East is starting to look like one big game of dominoes .
As the kings , unelected presidents and emirs watch what 's going on in the streets of Cairo , they ' ve got to be wondering if they 're going to be next .
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak 's days are clearly numbered .
At this point , it seems highly unlikely he 'll even make it through the rest of his term .
Mubarak would be following Tunisian President Zine El Abedine Ben Ali out the door after similar popular street movements pushed him out of power .
No doubt about it , some sort of genie is out of the bottle .
Yemen President Ali Abdullah Saleh says he wo n't seek re - election when his term ends in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2013">2013</TIMEX3> .
That 's after <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="P3DE" mod="MORE_THAN">more than three decades</TIMEX3> in office .
He also says he wo n't hand power over to his son .
Of course , he made that announcement ahead of a ` ` day of rage '' protest scheduled for <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2011-02-03">Thursday</TIMEX3> .
Thousands of people have already been demonstrating in Yemen in <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent weeks</TIMEX3> .
Over in Jordan , King Abdullah has sacked his government and appointed a new prime minister in the face of protests .
The king is asking the new government to implement what he calls ` ` genuine political reform . ''
It s funny how ` ` reform '' has suddenly become a priority in some of these countries after decades of repressive governments .
Meanwhile , demonstrators also are calling for change in Algeria and Sudan .
And in Syria , there are protests planned for <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2011-W05">this week</TIMEX3> .
Experts say these protests sweeping across the Middle East and North Africa are ` ` unprecedented '' and a ` ` watershed event for the Arab world . ''
For <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> , the leadership in Saudi Arabia and Libya seems secure , but it 's safe to say a new day is dawning .
Here s my question to you : What 's next for the Middle East ?

Somebody suggested , ` ` The devil you know is better than the devil you do n't know . ''
When it comes to Egypt , Hosni Mubarak is the devil we know .
Ruling for <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DURATION" value="P3DE">the last three decades</TIMEX3> , Mubarak has maintained Egypt as a moderate regional force in the face of extreme Islamist nations .
He 's also helped keep peace with Israel .
<TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> Mubarak says he 's not running for re - election
and it 's unclear how much longer he will cling to power .
Which brings us to who 's the devil we do n't know ?
History suggests we might want to watch what we wish for : Remember when the Bush administration pushed for democratic elections in Gaza and Hamas won ?

Or go back a little further : When the Shah of Iran was toppled <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="1981">30 years ago</TIMEX3> , the ayatollahs took over and Iran became an Islamic republic .

The Iranian Revolution was originally backed by many groups - much like the one in Egypt - but the extremists took control of the movement - and look where we are <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2011-02-03">today</TIMEX3> .
Some worry the same thing could happen in Egypt .
They fear the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood .
Even though the extremely conservative Islamic organization is banned from Egypt , it 's still the largest opposition group .
But not everyone agrees .
Egyptian opposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei rejects the idea that Islamic fundamentalists will take over .
The secular ElBaradei says he 's reaching out to the Muslim Brotherhood and that they need to be included in any new government .
Here s my question to you : What are the risks if Mubarak is removed from power in Egypt ?
As Egyptian protesters demanding reform fill the streets by the hundreds of thousands , it 's worth remembering that the U.S. helps control the purse strings in that country .
American taxpayers give $ 1.5 billion dollars <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> in foreign aid to Egypt , second only to Israel .
Although the White House has said it 's reviewing this aid depending on the military 's behavior - One top Republican says <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> is not the time to threaten to withhold any of this money .
Congresswoman Kay Granger - who chairs the house subcommittee in charge of foreign aid - says we should n't use the money as a stick to force Mubarak into reforms .
Granger says most of the $ 1.5 billion goes toward the military - which seems to be a stabilizing force among the demonstrators .
Granger says Congress should only consider withholding aid if there 's evidence that U.S. military equipment is being used improperly .
Several top Democrats are on the same page , saying the U.S. should remain committed to assisting Egypt .
They point to the close relationship between the two countries .
Nonetheless , some experts think cutting financial aid is the best way to get results .
A bipartisan group of former officials says the administration should suspend all aid to Egypt until the government : Agrees to elections <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">as soon as possible</TIMEX3> , allows banned candidates to run , immediately lifts the state of emergency that 's been in place for decades , releases political prisoners , and allows for freedom of the media and assembly .
Here s my question to you : Should the U.S. withhold any of its $ 1.5 billion in financial aid to Egypt ?
