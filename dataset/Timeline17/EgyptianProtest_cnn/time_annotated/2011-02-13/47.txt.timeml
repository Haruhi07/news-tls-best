` ` They need to come out of their headquarters and start talking to the people and tell us what is in store for us , '' ElBaradei told GPS .
And a prominent Egyptian activist credited with helping spark the revolution warned against taking too long to establish a new representative government .

<TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2011-02-13">Sunday</TIMEX3> 's military communique said new elections would be held for both houses of Egypt 's Parliament as well as the presidency .
Protesters had blasted the <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2010-11">November</TIMEX3> parliamentary elections as fraudulent , and calls for their annulment were among the major demands before Mubarak 's ouster .

Some protesters remained in the square <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2011-02-13">Sunday</TIMEX3> , vowing to keep protesting until Egypt is under civilian rule .
The Egyptian junta <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> has to grapple with the economic problems that fueled the revolt , including massive youth unemployment and economic underdevelopment .
The demonstrations virtually shut down Egypt 's economy , costing it vital tourism dollars as well .
New protests at the headquarters of the National Bank of Egypt appear to have forced the ouster of that institution 's chairman , Tarek Amer , and two top deputies , who submitted their resignations on <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2011-02-13">Sunday</TIMEX3> , according to an e - mail shared with CNN by a bank employee .
