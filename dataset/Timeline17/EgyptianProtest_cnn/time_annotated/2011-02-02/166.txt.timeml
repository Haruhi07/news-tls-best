Heavy gunfire reverberated in central Cairo before dawn <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2011-01-27">Thursday</TIMEX3> as supporters and foes of embattled Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak continued to face off at Tahrir Square , where chunks of concretes and Molotov cocktails were employed as weapons in the escalating crisis .
CNN personnel saw wounded people being carried into Tahrir Square , largely held by anti - regime demonstrators , through an entrance that leads to the nearby Egyptian Museum .
Several ambulances entered and left the square shortly before <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="TIME" value="2011-01-27T04:00">4 a.m. Thursday</TIMEX3> .
The source of the gunfire was not immediately known .
Voices were heard chanting a prayer after <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> of violent street battles in central Cairo .
Sustained automatic weapons fire , including from what sounded like a heavy machine gun , echoed around the square , the epicenter of <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P9D">nine days</TIMEX3> of protests calling for Mubarak 's ouster .
Anti - government demonstrators hunkered down behind makeshift barricades in the square and outside the nearby national museum against the onslaught , which demonstrators said included plainclothes police officers .
` ` They 're coming in with weapons .
They 're spreading violence , '' human rights activist Gigi Ibrahim told CNN on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2011-02-02">Wednesday</TIMEX3> .
` ` We ' ve had peaceful protests here since <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2011-01-28">Friday</TIMEX3> and no violence here .
Only <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2011-02-02">today</TIMEX3> were we faced with this really violent reaction . ''
The pro - government protesters were not impeded by the army when they entered the square , CNN 's Ben Wedeman said <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2011-01-27" mod="START">early Thursday</TIMEX3> .
Anti - regime protesters are <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> unhappy with troops , whose commanders had promised <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2011-01-31">Monday</TIMEX3> not to use force against peaceful demonstrations , for standing by , he said .
Small fires burned in the square <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2011-01-27" mod="START">early Thursday</TIMEX3> , some spreading to trees and walls .
Egypt 's health ministry reported three people were killed and 639 were wounded in <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2011-02-02">Wednesday</TIMEX3> 's clashes , according to the state television network .
Reported fatalities in <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="P8D">the previous eight days</TIMEX3> of demonstrations ranged as high as 300 , but CNN has not been able to independently confirm the death toll .
In one surreal moment , whip - wielding Mubarak supporters thundered through the crowd astride horses and camels , and at least one man was pulled off his mount and beaten .
A Mubarak supporter who spoke to CNN said the riders were pyramid workers who were protesting the negative economic impact of the crisis .
