The Middle East is starting to look like one big game of dominoes .
As the kings , unelected presidents and emirs watch what 's going on in the streets of Cairo , they ' ve got to be wondering if they 're going to be next .
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak 's days are clearly numbered .
At this point , it seems highly unlikely he 'll even make it through the rest of his term .
Mubarak would be following Tunisian President Zine El Abedine Ben Ali out the door after similar popular street movements pushed him out of power .
No doubt about it , some sort of genie is out of the bottle .
Yemen President Ali Abdullah Saleh says he wo n't seek re - election when his term ends in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2013">2013</TIMEX3> .
That 's after <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P3DE" mod="MORE_THAN">more than three decades</TIMEX3> in office .
He also says he wo n't hand power over to his son .
Of course , he made that announcement ahead of a ` ` day of rage '' protest scheduled for <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2011-01-27">Thursday</TIMEX3> .
Thousands of people have already been demonstrating in Yemen in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent weeks</TIMEX3> .
Over in Jordan , King Abdullah has sacked his government and appointed a new prime minister in the face of protests .
The king is asking the new government to implement what he calls ` ` genuine political reform . ''
It s funny how ` ` reform '' has suddenly become a priority in some of these countries after decades of repressive governments .
Meanwhile , demonstrators also are calling for change in Algeria and Sudan .
And in Syria , there are protests planned for <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2011-W05">this week</TIMEX3> .
Experts say these protests sweeping across the Middle East and North Africa are ` ` unprecedented '' and a ` ` watershed event for the Arab world . ''
For <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> , the leadership in Saudi Arabia and Libya seems secure , but it 's safe to say a new day is dawning .
Here s my question to you : What 's next for the Middle East ?
Interested to know which ones made it on air ?
Jack , Do n't worry about what 's next in the Middle East .
Worry about what 's next in America .
The riots in the Middle East are economic - related .
They 're driven by high unemployment , economic disaster , and a government that does n't do its job .
I ' m sure Greece , France and Ireland understand perfectly what 's happening in Egypt .
What 's next for the Middle East is playing catch - up on nearly a thousand years of human rights history , from Britain 's Magna Carta in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="1215">1215</TIMEX3> until a desperate Tunisian set himself on fire <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2011-01">last month</TIMEX3> .
In a let 's - get - it - done - by - breakfast world , already precariously balanced , this is not a task for the faint - hearted .
I think we can expect to see more people taking to the streets in other Middle Eastern countries seeking change .
It 's like a fever that sweeps over an area and everyone catches it .
What is next for us is higher oil prices .
Nick in San Diego writes : If we side with the people for democratic reform in that whole region and tell Israel to get serious concerning the Palestinians or the money stops NOW , we 'll be ok .
If not , brace ourselves for more 9 - 11 's .
What 's next is we finally see if democracy is really all we ' ve been building it up to be .
More of the same .
The Middle East has been a hotbed of unrest since God was a little boy .
It 's not going to change .
And our interference will only result in more Americans being sent home in pine boxes and a bigger hole in our budget .
It 's not our business .
I doubt seriously that the Egyptians are sitting about asking each other what 's next for Chicago or Des Moines .
Whatever happens , if it is not to the liking of Israel , the lid to Pandora 's box comes blasting off .
Driven by the victim mentality , Israel is the one to keep an eye toward .
With their overwhelming military power , and paranoid leadership , one wrong move by Israel could lead to the end of the world as we know it .
The Rapture , in other words .
Whatever is in store for the Middle East , the U.S. should let it play out without any interference or threats of action or fleet movements or disparaging remarks about the principle players .
It is time the U.S. learned to deal with the world as it is and stop trying to make the world over in its own image .
Hamas , Hezbollah and possibly the Muslim Brotherhood are legitimate political parties in some of those countries .
It is hypocritical and counterproductive to call for democratic elections , and then to vilify the parties that were democratically elected and refuse to deal with them because they have a different world view than we do .
We have to learn to find common ground and work with these groups .

They know the results of the nasty leaders in Iran and I believe they do not want to live that way .
I have faith in the people of Egypt .
Ken Krieger Cape Coral , Florida <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2011-02-02">February 2 , 2011</TIMEX3> at <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="TIME" value="2011-02-02T17:48">5:48 pm</TIMEX3> | What 's next for the Middle East ?
The Middle East is surely going through a series of domino effect because of these politicians and false promises .
One man will surely come out after the death of King Abdullah .
He will be from the descendant of the Prophet Muhammad -LRB- PBUH -RRB- .
There is nothing to be frightened of .
He loves humanity , he will rule with justice and peace and abide by the rules of the Qur ` an .
The genie is out of the bottle .
It looks like <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3> is going to be the year of massive upheavals throughout the Middle East and , possible , beyond .
I would not be surprised if the citizens of Iran return to the streets of Tehran and demand changes in their government .
North Africa , the Middle East , and repressive regimes in the neighborhood are liable to be scenes of riots and demonstrations the likes of which we have never seen and will remember for a long time .
The task for the U.S. and other democracies is to support those marching for freedom while not seeming to be pushing events in one direction or another .
Let them have their revolutions and let us accept the outcomes .
We have supported dictators for too long .

At long last people are standing up for themselves instead of beckoning the Western powers to bail them out .
Western countries had to fight for thier freedoms -- all of them hoad some sort of uprising 100s of years ago ... from the US to France to Britian and even non - Western Russia .
<TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> all we need is an uprising in North Korea somehow and we 're all set .
<TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="2011-02-02">February 2 , 2011</TIMEX3> at <TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="TIME" value="2011-02-02T17:52">5:52 pm</TIMEX3> | I am sure this is a sign that the Arab world is <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> going to fall in line with the West and begin to indoctrinate our values into its newly found democratic culture .
The world will be a Utopian paradise in no time ...
OR -LRB- more likely -RRB- this means that the status quo of the west hate rhetoric is about to intensify with younger , stronger , more militarized & aggressive leaders .
<TIMEX3 tid="t38" type="DATE" value="2011-02-02">February 2 , 2011</TIMEX3> at <TIMEX3 tid="t40" type="TIME" value="2011-02-02T17:54">5:54 pm</TIMEX3> | If we side with the People for demcratic reform in that whole region and tell Israel to get serious concerning the Palestinians or the $ $ $ stops NOW , we 'll be ok .
If not brace ourselves for more 911 's <TIMEX3 tid="t43" type="DATE" value="2011-02-02">February 2 , 2011</TIMEX3> at <TIMEX3 tid="t45" type="TIME" value="2011-02-02T17:54">5:54 pm</TIMEX3> | Next up is the emergence of the Muslim Brotherhood taking over all muslim countries , re - establishment of the Chaliphate , and world dominance of Islam .
It is afterall the goal of the MB to establish Islam throughout the worlsd , this is the first of it .
<TIMEX3 tid="t48" type="DATE" value="2011-02-02">February 2 , 2011</TIMEX3> at <TIMEX3 tid="t50" type="TIME" value="2011-02-02T17:55">5:55 pm</TIMEX3> | What does this mean for the rest of the world ?
Will new regimes spark more anti - western sentiment in the middle east , or will they stabilize this volatile region ? ?
<TIMEX3 tid="t53" type="DATE" value="2011-02-02">February 2 , 2011</TIMEX3> at <TIMEX3 tid="t55" type="TIME" value="2011-02-02T17:56">5:56 pm</TIMEX3> |
What if some of these new regimes , elected into office democratically , actually provide for their people , but are more authoritarian and Islam fundamentalist , perhaps anti - U.S.-anti - Israeli .
Be careful what you wish for .
<TIMEX3 tid="t58" type="DATE" value="2011-02-02">February 2 , 2011</TIMEX3> at <TIMEX3 tid="t60" type="TIME" value="2011-02-02T17:57">5:57 pm</TIMEX3> | Jack , do n't worry about what 's next in the Middle East .
Worry about what 's next in America .
The riots in the Middle East are economic related .
Driven by high unemployment , economic disaster , and a government that does n't do it 's job .
I ' m sure Greece , France and Ireland understand perfectly what 's happening in Egypt .

Increased oil profits for those who last the longest .
Middle - Eastern cultures are not breeding grounds for a stable democracy , they are hot - beds of centuries old superstitions , hatreds , igorance and corruption .
<TIMEX3 tid="t68" type="DATE" value="2011-02-02">February 2 , 2011</TIMEX3> at <TIMEX3 tid="t70" type="TIME" value="2011-02-02T17:59">5:59 pm</TIMEX3> | So what 's new that Revolutions occur with each new generation .
Times and needs change according to the new ideas and demands of the populace .
The U.S.A. constitution foresaw and provided the Power of Amendments in a peaceful manner .

And , all the more reason to avoid uprisings with the utilization of democratic concepts by and for the people .
By <TIMEX3 tid="t71" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> , Kingdoms , Monarchies and Dictators should be History , if not for the Human urge to maintain control and power over others .
Not wanting to relinquish power , foments Revolution , but the Ego is over powering to those few who think they know what is best for themselves and the Little People .
<TIMEX3 tid="t74" type="DATE" value="2011-02-02">February 2 , 2011</TIMEX3> at <TIMEX3 tid="t76" type="TIME" value="2011-02-02T18:02">6:02 pm</TIMEX3> | Dominoes ?
I will probably be more like a game of potato head - changing parts of the head while the restt of the body stays the same .
<TIMEX3 tid="t79" type="DATE" value="2011-02-02">February 2 , 2011</TIMEX3> at <TIMEX3 tid="t81" type="TIME" value="2011-02-02T18:03">6:03 pm</TIMEX3> | It is anyone 's guess what will happen next .
The people are speaking , with a very loud voice .
I think the model to look at is Glasnost with Gorbachev , seems like a similar situation .
I think Democracy will rise in these countries and there will be economic turmoil for a while before things stabilize .
<TIMEX3 tid="t84" type="DATE" value="2011-02-02">February 2 , 2011</TIMEX3> at <TIMEX3 tid="t86" type="TIME" value="2011-02-02T18:05">6:05 pm</TIMEX3> | What 's next ?
I fear more violence and bloodshed , but I also hope that the people in the Middle East will be able to achieve what most people want - a decent life with dignity and freedom , a life in which they can achieve their full potential .
Some autocrats make do lip - service to reform , but it will only be to silence their critics until those critics can be totally silenced .
<TIMEX3 tid="t89" type="DATE" value="2011-02-02">February 2 , 2011</TIMEX3> at <TIMEX3 tid="t91" type="TIME" value="2011-02-02T18:06">6:06 pm</TIMEX3> | This is an important opportunity for the U.S but from what I ' m seeing we are not taken advantage of it .
Tehran hang three people <TIMEX3 tid="t92" type="DATE" value="2011-W05">this week</TIMEX3> for <TIMEX3 tid="t93" type="DATE" value="2010">last year</TIMEX3> demonstrations .
They did it <TIMEX3 tid="t94" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> just in case anyone has any ideas to start the demonstrations again .
Ahmedinejad is an evil s.o.b and we can give him some of his own medicine .
All Hillary or Obama have to say is ` ` people should not put up with oppression and small time dictators '' .
I guarantee you the Iranian people will get the message .
<TIMEX3 tid="t95" type="DURATION" value="PXD">Some day</TIMEX3> they will hang Ahmedinejad and the mullahs from the balconies of Tehran .
<TIMEX3 tid="t98" type="DATE" value="2011-02-02">February 2 , 2011</TIMEX3> at <TIMEX3 tid="t100" type="TIME" value="2011-02-02T18:07">6:07 pm</TIMEX3> | The Middle East is heading into a revolutionary phase .
First Morocco and <TIMEX3 tid="t101" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> Egypt which is one of the bigger Middle Eastern prodomently Muslim nations .
I can see several of the other nations either falling or adjusting to the new trend .
The new trend is the Isalmic Brotherhood .
The Islamic Brotherhood is a pro - Taliban and promote strict discipline to Allah without question or doubts .
Once they are in control , Egypt will be in an even worse off situation .
One country that needs to be on heighten awareness is Israel .
The Islamic Brotherhood have stated that Israel needs to be destroyed .
<TIMEX3 tid="t104" type="DATE" value="2011-02-02">February 2 , 2011</TIMEX3> at <TIMEX3 tid="t106" type="TIME" value="2011-02-02T18:09">6:09 pm</TIMEX3> | Do n't know what to believe here , Jack .
I hope -- that this is the beginning of the internet being used as a powerful social tool for massive positive change .
I fear -- that the change could be a fall to decades of ruin unless reasonable governments are built rapidly -- usually its just a power grab , but this seems different .
I know -- that danger lies in masses of ignorant and uneducated people just expressing their anger -- education is the key to any county 's success .
<TIMEX3 tid="t111" type="DATE" value="2011-02-02">February 2 , 2011</TIMEX3> at <TIMEX3 tid="t113" type="TIME" value="2011-02-02T18:10">6:10 pm</TIMEX3> | Once consolidated the Muslim Brotherhood will turn toward Israel and WWlll will begin shortly after .
I have never seen anything like this .
The coming together of the Republican and Democratic elitists to denounce Mubarak after <TIMEX3 tid="t115" type="DURATION" value="P30Y">30 years</TIMEX3> of propping him up .
<TIMEX3 tid="t116" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> both party ` s seem to endorse the Muslim Brotherhood .
We , the people of America , have elected the stupidest most self serving congress in all of history .
This can not come out good and most probably turn out real bad for us here in the states .

They intend to take over all of the countries , and convert them to militant run countries , under the control of Al - Queda , and their allies .
Once they have gained control of the middle east , they will move to other countries one by one , and indeed , they have already inserted militant violence into many countries outside of the middle east , including Indonesia , Malaysia , Thailand , and African countries , including Somalia .

The Islamic populations of many western countries , are seeing the impact of violence in those countries , already , as well , to include France and Holland , as well as the UK .
This is , and has always been , a religious conflict , and it will eventually become world war 3 .

Libya actually has one of the worst oppressive regimen in the region .
actually we Libyan used to look to Tunisia and Egypt as a heaven comparing to our Gaddafi oppression , I think the problem is Libya has not usually had a fair share of media coverage as the other countries in the region .
Gaddafi regimen has being nothing but a mix of oppression and brutality for <TIMEX3 tid="t315" type="DURATION" value="P42Y">42 years</TIMEX3> .

Yet they keep having babies by the dozens -LRB- literally -RRB- .
Just how many jobs are there for billions of people ?
How much food grows in the desert ?
Is anyone talking about this ?

We can not afford top be on the fence .

Governments fell , autocratic families lost their reputations and power and all of Europe was reshaped as World War One raged and reformed countries and alliances .

Some democratic governments will come out as we expect and some wo n't but that should n't let us support a dictator again .

As provocative as <TIMEX3 tid="t508" type="DURATION" value="PXW">the past couple of weeks</TIMEX3> have been , the issues these citizens have been protesting against are the issues of their nation , and in all honesty , need to be addressed by the powers to be within their nation .
My fear is that OUR nation somehow sees this as a problem WE need to fix .
Hopefully , that will not be the case .

Whatever governments are formed in the wake of this are going to need aid and when they come knocking on the rest of the world 's door for it -LRB- certainly oil - rich Arab countries like Saudi Arabia wo n't help them - they never give to crisis funds -RRB- , we should negotiate a peace agreement that gives them autonomy over their lands , natural resources and governments but puts pressure on accepting Israel .
If they wo n't support that -- no aid .

But they could n't stop the advancement of <TIMEX3 tid="t519" type="DATE" value="19">20th century</TIMEX3> communications .
It was inevitable that people living behind the Iron Curtain would learn what life was like outside .
<TIMEX3 tid="t521" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> , thanks to <TIMEX3 tid="t520" type="DATE" value="20">21st century</TIMEX3> communications via the web , something similar is happening in the middle east .
A lot of what happens may be dependent on what they believe the rest of us have , which they have been denied .
of the world feel the need to be cautious of what they say publicly maybe the rest of us need to signal our support and encourage the Egyptians to choose a secular democracy that will last instead of just another oppressive theocratic regime .

What would be truly ironic , however , would be if Bush 's prophecy and hope for democratic states in the Middle East , came to pass .
According to our highly esteemed Vice President , Mr. Biden , Egypt is already in that column .
<TIMEX3 tid="t532" type="DATE" value="2011-02-02">February 2 , 2011</TIMEX3> at <TIMEX3 tid="t534" type="TIME" value="2011-02-02T18:30">6:30 pm</TIMEX3> | This is history being made right in front of our eyes .
This is control by fear and the toxicity of shame being cast aside for democracy and freedom .
This is absolute ideology that cripples everyone , even us , being shunned and replaced with truth and imagination by the youth in these countries .
Whether the path to God is through Jesus , Abraham , Buddha , or Mohammad , the goal of all of us to come together at the feet of this one God we all seek no matter the path we take .

And the young sisters and brothers of the Middle East are beginning on this path of unity and freedom .

To say that we did not see this coming is foolish .
Technology plays a very important role in people 's realization that they do not have to live the way the upper crust forces them to live .
An awakening of this sort should not be discarded in the U.S. among the ethnic groups here .

Hopefully I ' m wrong !

The only thing that is a predictable and clear outcome from what is going on is that The President needed to take a stand , and as usual , did not , and will notdo so in the future .
His inability to stand up for democracy and american values , even in the face of muslims clearly independently demanding it , demostrates the total ineffectiveness of his perceived politically correct policy of non interfearance in muslim foreign affairs .
It is totally pathetic that he does n't encourage their desire for freedom , and he does n't use the opportunity to warn against the Muslim Brotherhood who present such a threat to the future of their freedom .

Jordan is a modern and peaceful country , we have been affected by the rising food and oil prices like the rest of the world , it 's true that jobs are scarce due to the increase in the number of the population , but no one can call our King Abdullah a dictator .
There have been calls for the dismissal of Samir Rifaai 's government for months and months , way before what had happened in Tunisia and Egypt , our country is in no way ` ` in danger '' nor are we ` ` nervous '' or part of this domino scheme you speak of .

And not just in the Middle East , but everywhere .
The Egypt situation clearly shows the enormous power the general public has when it is able to organize and plan collectively .
Sure , when the voices of the majority are faint and distant , the Musharrafs and al - Gadaffis of the world can plant themselves at the top and use economies as personal fortunes .

But when the population integrates its anger , the guillotine is next .

Mummies that are their ancestors .

Well lets try south east
Asia -LRB- Bangladesh , and the likes , perhaps countries near Europe : Morocco , Turkey -RRB-
Surprisingly Libya will remain relatively stable .
America might want to review it 's exit strategy for the region .

If reform equals democracy ; Middle Eastern democracy will not look like American democracy .
We in the west need to be open to facilitate the discussions with these countries for them to define what democracy is to them and not place our form of government and governing on them .
We need to respect their culture
-LRB- s -RRB- .
How they do it and what it will look like will be different from how western governments govern but that is not to say that democracy in the Middle East will not work .

This revolution wo n't be isolated only to the Middle East , I ' m convinced it will spread down to the Southern part of Africa harboring many dictators well over 80 , and wish to continue rulling .
I think it 's time for people to excercise their power peacefully and kick out people like Mugabe of Zimbabwe , Paul Biya of Cameroon etc , who think dictatorship and bad governace is the way forward .
It 's time to bring in modern and 21 st century leaders .

What 's next for the Muslims in the Middle East is <TIMEX3 tid="t603" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> being played out on the big screen .
What 's next for the U.S. and the Western world depends on our ability to support the democratic ideals that we inspired in the first place .
The U.S. must vacate the cowardice idea of supporting Mubarak in the presence of an uncertain outcome .
This is our great opportunity to defy history and help forge a new path for the Middle East and a new future for our World .

I admire these people as they have the guts to step outside the box .
They can see a threat to their freedoms and take complete charge of restoring them or broadening them , even if it means blood shed .
Americans , the majority , think this reaction to their government is barbaric .
I tend to think it is heroic .

Egypt will partner with Iran and put pressure on the 2 remaining western - friendly states , Israel and Saudi Arabia .
Democracy in this region of the world means mob rule .
Without a foundation built on indiividual freedom , freedom of religion , separation of church and state , and equality for all citizens , democracy is no better than a dicatator .
Without a nation of laws , protecting it 's people from the government and placing the rights of individuals above the moral dictates of the ruler , the majority will suppress the minorities , in this case , in the name of religious rights .
People do n't seem to understand that Democracy is just a civilized way to transfer power and speaks nothing as to the nature of the power that will be wielded by the winners of elections .
In this case the majority view women as inferior and have no tolerance of religions outside Islam .
Indeed , good times are ahead of us .

Whether we end up with regimes such as that of Turkey or Iran depends on how fast western democracies line up with the side of the masses .

Who 'd have expected that a frustrated guy in Tunisia could ' ve sparked all of this .
The pressure has been on for a very long time , and too much pressure causes explosion .
There are important points that we all should learn from this .
Most importantly , in my own opinion is to support the new generation .
Those who are protesting peacefuly .
We need to show that the protesting peacefuly is the right thing to do , and that resorting to violence is not the answer .
We are witnesses the generation of Face Book and Twitter facing off with the generation of horses and camels .
If we do the right thing , I can see a different , more peaceful Middle East .
Information Technology did not only allow people in the Middle East to express their views , but more importantly , allowed them to see democracy at work in America and Europe , and they deserve no less .
