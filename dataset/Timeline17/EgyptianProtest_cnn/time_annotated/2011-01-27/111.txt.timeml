An earlier ruling from a lower court said Rahm Emanuel did n't meet residency requirements for mayoral candidates .

A roundup of <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2011-01-27">today</TIMEX3> 's CNNMoney news :
AT&T locks in 4 million iPhone users : <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2012-Q4">The fourth quarter</TIMEX3> marked the last full quarter of AT&T 's iPhone exclusivity agreement with Apple .

There has been a common thread in the <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> political upheaval in Tunisia and Egypt : Social media has played a role in both influencing the protests and reporting on them .
` ` Social media is key to the revolution taking place in North Africa , and <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="2011-05">this may</TIMEX3> actually be the first time a government leader has lost power because of social media , '' said Darrell West , the vice president for governance studies at the Brookings Institution , referring to the ousting of former Tunisian president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali .
However , social media is n't strictly a tool for those with a gripe with their government .
Governments themselves have shown a willingness to use websites like Twitter for their own means in the wake of unrest , according to James Carafano , a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation .
Any normal player might have gotten lost in the mayhem and hype of Brigham Young University 's most anticipated basketball game in school history .
Jimmer Fredette is no normal player .
The senior guard led the Cougars to a 71 - 58 rout of No . 4 ranked San Diego State <TIMEX3 tid="t37" type="TIME" value="2011-01-26TNI">Wednesday night</TIMEX3> at the Marriott Center .
Though the nail - biting action of two top-10 teams battling it out lasted until <TIMEX3 tid="t38" type="DATE" value="2010-Q4">the fourth quarter</TIMEX3> , the Aztecs fell short in their attempts to stave off Fredette 's offensive charge .
As SI.com s Kelli Anderson writes : ` ` The Aztecs , the best defensive team in the conference , threw all sorts of defenders at Fredette , from D.J. Gay to Billy White to Chase Tapley , sometimes two at a time .
The defensive pressure frequently forced him to change his mind in mid - air and pass instead of shoot -LRB-
and he coughed up the ball four times -RRB-
but he still filled the bucket . ''
The game marked Fredette 's 15th in which he scored 30 points or more , clearly making him one of the school 's most fabled athletes and one of the year s biggest successes .
He is on track to reach a rare milestone as well : nabbing a scoring title and the National Player of the Year award .
He would join Bradley s Hersey Hawkins and Purdue s Glenn Robinson as the only three players since <TIMEX3 tid="t39" type="DATE" value="1970">1970</TIMEX3> to achieve the honor .
These small hand axes are at least 100,000 years old .
A team of scientists found these tools in the United Arab Emirates .
Scientists have discovered new evidence suggesting that modern humans first left Africa to explore Eurasia much earlier than previously thought .
An international team of scientists has uncovered a tool kit that indicates that modern humans , who looked and perhaps behaved much like us , must have lived in eastern Arabia about 100,000 to 125,000 years ago .
The collection of small hand axes , scrapers and other tools was found in Jebel Faya , United Arab Emirates .
A report about the discovery appears in the journal Science .
The people who made these tools ` ` are our ancestors , I have no doubt about that , '' said Hans - Peter Uerpmann , of the University of Tubingen in Germany , who collaborated on the project , at a press teleconference <TIMEX3 tid="t40" type="DATE" value="2011-01-26">Wednesday</TIMEX3> .
But the findings still do not prove definitively that modern humans made these tools , as the researchers did not find human remains near them , said Ted Goebel , anthropologist at Texas A&M University , who was not involved in the study .
They potentially could have been made by Neanderthals or Neanderthal - like hominids , who were already in Eurasia at that time , Goebel said .
Almost 300 protesters arrived at Athens University <TIMEX3 tid="t41" type="DATE" value="2011-W04">this week</TIMEX3> and are staging a hunger strike .
Riot police in Athens , Greece , <TIMEX3 tid="t43" type="DATE" value="2011-01-27" mod="END">late Thursday</TIMEX3> surrounded a law school where 237 immigrants are waging a hunger strike , according to a Greek newspaper .
The protesters , who arrived <TIMEX3 tid="t44" type="DATE" value="2011-W04">this week</TIMEX3> from the Greek island of Crete , are demanding residence permits , Kathimerini reported , and the police arrived after failed attempts to move the protesters to another building in central Athens .
Athens University s Law School and the government have been at odds over whose responsibility it was to handle the demonstrators .
The prosecutor s office for the appeals court announced an inquiry into whether the university failed to take action to prevent the immigrants from occupying the building .
The Athens News Agency explained that under Greek law , university campuses are off - limits to police unless they have been invited or a serious crime has been committed .
Greece s majority party says leftists have abused the law and are using the immigrants as political pawns .

Los Angeles detectives assigned to the Grim Sleeper serial killer case say they are investigating two additional homicides that may be the work of suspect Lonnie Franklin Jr. , according to an aide for an L.A. councilman in whose district some of the killings took place .
