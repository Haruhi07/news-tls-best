The servers for the Egyptian government 's sites and for the U.S. Embassy in Cairo also appeared to be down .
` ` We are closely monitoring the situation and are aware that communication services , including social media , are being blocked , '' U.S. State Department Spokesman P.J. Crowley said <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2011-01-27">Thursday</TIMEX3> .

Government officials could not be immediately reached to comment on the internet and text message situation .

Opposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei arrived in Cairo on <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2011-01-27">Thursday</TIMEX3> and said ` ` there is no going back '' on change .
ElBaradei , the Egyptian Nobel laureate , said people have taken to the streets because they ` ` realize the regime is not listening , not acting . ''
` ` The barrier of fear is broken , '' ElBaradei said after he arrived in Egypt from Europe on <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2011-01-27">Thursday</TIMEX3> .
` ` And it will not come back . ''
<TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> ElBaradei has said he will take part in the protests and passed along ` ` advice to the regime : It 's <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> the time to listen to the people .
Make an innocent collective change . ''
He called for demonstrations to be peaceful and for the government of President Hosni Mubarak to stop detaining and torturing people .
He said that a violent response from the government is ` ` counterproductive '' and that the regime should promote democracy and social justice .
` ` I am asking the regime to listen to the people before it is too late , '' the opposition leader said , adding that he hopes to help broker a peaceful resolution to the unrest .

Asked <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2011-01-27">Thursday</TIMEX3> if the time has come for Mubarak to step aside , U.S. Vice President Joe Biden said , ` ` No , I think the time has come for President Mubarak to move in the direction to be more responsive to some of the needs of the people out there . ''
` ` A lot of the people out there protesting are middle class folks who are looking for a little more access , a little more opportunity , '' Biden said in an interview with PBS .
` ` I think that President Mubarak is going to respond to the legitimate concerns that are being raised . ''
The U.S. Embassy in Cairo issued a message <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2011-01-27">Thursday</TIMEX3> telling Americans that ` ` areas where people congregate after <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2011-01-21">Friday</TIMEX3> prayers should be avoided . ''
` ` While many of the demonstrations have focused on the downtown Cairo\/Tahrir Square area , violent confrontations have occurred at other locations both in the Cairo metropolitan area and in Alexandria , Suez , and other cities , '' it said .
At least six have died in the demonstrations so far , according to the Interior Ministry and media reports .

` ` It is very important that people have mechanisms in order to express legitimate grievances , '' he said <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2011-01-27">Thursday</TIMEX3> .
The State Department also weighed in on events in Egypt on <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2011-01-27">Thursday</TIMEX3> , with Crowley saying , ` ` We want to make sure that there 's no interference with the opportunity for the Egyptian people to use social media . ''
Crowley 's remarks followed reports that social media sites like Twitter have been blocked for many Egyptian users in <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent days</TIMEX3> .
` ` To the extent that we obviously see that , country by country across the region , people are watching what has happened in Tunisia ... they are drawing lessons from what is happening , '' Crowley said .
<TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="2011-01" mod="START">Earlier this month</TIMEX3> , street protests in Tunisia led to the ouster of Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali .
With all eyes in Egypt focused on the protests , some events have been suspended .
The Egyptian football federation has decided to postpone games scheduled for <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DATE" value="2011-01-21">Friday</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="DATE" value="2011-01-22">Saturday</TIMEX3> until further notice , according to Egypt 's official news agency .
A smattering of protesters were in the streets on <TIMEX3 tid="t36" type="DATE" value="2011-01-27">Thursday</TIMEX3> , after massive public protests on <TIMEX3 tid="t37" type="DATE" value="2011-01-25">Tuesday</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t38" type="DATE" value="2011-01-26">Wednesday</TIMEX3> calling for the ouster of Mubarak convulsed the nation and prompted a tough security crackdown .
One protester arrested in <TIMEX3 tid="t39" type="DATE" value="2011-01-25">Tuesday</TIMEX3> 's demonstrations told CNN <TIMEX3 tid="t40" type="DATE" value="2011-01-27">Thursday</TIMEX3> that his nose and glasses were smashed by police before he was taken to a military camp and placed in a ward with about 300 other activists .
` ` The conditions were terrible because very few were allowed to go to the toilet , and we had to stand on the cold tiles of the floor -LRB- which were -RRB- very dirty , '' said Ahmed , who would not give his last name .
Ahmed said he was disappointed by the United States ' reaction to the protests .
` ` The people of Egypt only want to see Egypt as a free , democratic country , and we would always assume that the United States is our model , '' he said .
` ` We ca n't understand how come this leader of the free world is looking the other way when it comes to our rights or freedom . ''
` ` The despotic regime that -LRB- the U.S.
-RRB- supports always demonizes the image of United States ... always putting blame on the United States for everything , '' Ahmed said of the Egyptian government .
Cairo was quiet <TIMEX3 tid="t42" type="DATE" value="2011-01-27">Thursday</TIMEX3> compared with <TIMEX3 tid="t41" type="DATE" value="2011-01-26">previous days</TIMEX3> , but there appear to have been smaller skirmishes , and more are anticipated as night comes .
In Suez , the port city east of Cairo on the Gulf of Suez , people congregated to demand the release of those detained , and clashes broke out between demonstrators and security forces .
The city has long been home to resentment against the government for economic and social reasons .
Hani Abdel Latif , an Interior Ministry official , said that 50 people demonstrated peacefully in Ismaeliya .
But there were news reports of clashes there .
In Egypt 's Sinai region , there were clashes between security forces and protesters , television footage of the scene showed .
Egypt briefly closed its stock market <TIMEX3 tid="t43" type="DATE" value="2011-01-27">Thursday</TIMEX3> after it fell sharply .
It reopened <TIMEX3 tid="t45" type="DURATION" value="PT1H">about an hour</TIMEX3> later .
At the same time , Egypt 's ruling NationalDemocratic Party made reference to the discontent on the streets .
Secretary - General Safwat al - Sherif said the party wants to talk with the youths who have been at the forefront of the protests .

The protest movement in Egypt has been fueled by blogs and social media sites like Twitter and Facebook .
ElBaradei , who is also the former head of the United Nations ' nuclear watchdog agency , has been posting messages of support for the demonstrators on Twitter .
` ` We shall continue to exercise our right of peaceful demonstration and restore our freedom & dignity .
Regime violence will backfire badly , '' he said in one of his latest tweets .
A Facebook page devoted to <TIMEX3 tid="t48" type="DATE" value="2011-01-21">Friday</TIMEX3> 's planned protests had more than 80,000 followers as of <TIMEX3 tid="t50" type="TIME" value="2011-01-21T14:00">2 p.m.</TIMEX3> ET <TIMEX3 tid="t49" type="DATE" value="2011-01-27">Thursday</TIMEX3> , compared with 20,000 <TIMEX3 tid="t47" type="DATE" value="2011-01-26">the previous day</TIMEX3> .
As he was waiting to leave Vienna , Austria , ElBaradei said he was going to Egypt to ` ` make sure that things will be managed in a peaceful way . ''
` ` I have to give them as much support , political support , spiritual , moral support , whatever I can do , you know , '' he said .
` ` I will be with them .
They are my people , and I have to be there , and I 'd like to see Egypt , a new Egypt . ''
In an interview <TIMEX3 tid="t52" type="DATE" value="2011-01-25">Tuesday</TIMEX3> on CNN 's ` ` Connect the World , '' ElBaradei disputed a <TIMEX3 tid="t51" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> comment by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton that the Egyptian government is stable .
` ` Stability is when you have a government that is elected on a free and fair basis .
And we have seen , you know , how the election has been rigged in Egypt .
We have seen how people have been tortured , '' he said .
ElBaradei was asked whether he would run for the presidency of Egypt .
` ` The priority for me , '' he said , ` ` is to shift Egypt into a democracy , is to catch up with <TIMEX3 tid="t53" type="DATE" value="20">the 21st century</TIMEX3> , to get Egypt to be a modern and ... moderate society and respecting human rights , respecting the basic freedoms of the people .
` ` Whether I run or not , that is totally irrelevant .

And I made it very clear , I will not run under the present conditions , when the deck is stacked completely . ''
The outpouring of protests has led to unprecedented violence <TIMEX3 tid="t54" type="DATE" value="2011-W04">this week</TIMEX3> .
Police turned water cannons and tear gas on protesters <TIMEX3 tid="t55" type="DATE" value="2011-01-26">Wednesday</TIMEX3> to try to break up anti - government demonstrations as the Interior Ministry warned it ` ` will not allow any provocative movement or a protest or rallies or demonstrations . ''
In the heart of Cairo , people were being beaten with sticks and fists and demonstrators were being dragged away amid tear gas .

In Suez , state - run Nile News TV reported violent clashes <TIMEX3 tid="t57" type="TIME" value="2011-01-26TNI">Wednesday night</TIMEX3> between security forces and protesters .
At least 27 people were wounded , Nile News said , most of them police officers .
Quoting provincial officials , the station said most of the clashes took place in the Alarbeen neighborhood and that looters attacked some shops .
The Muslim Brotherhood said 35 people were injured in Suez and that security forces in the city had implemented a curfew there <TIMEX3 tid="t59" type="TIME" value="2011-01-26TNI">Wednesday night</TIMEX3> .
Families and friends of people slain in Suez said angry demonstrations occurred because police did n't hand over the bodies of those killed .
