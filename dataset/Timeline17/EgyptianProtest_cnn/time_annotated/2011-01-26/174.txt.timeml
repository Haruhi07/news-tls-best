Cairo , Egypt -LRB-
CNN -RRB- -- Thousands of protesters spilled into the streets of Egypt on <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2011-01-25">Tuesday</TIMEX3> , an unprecedented display of anti - government rage inspired in part by the tumult in the nearby North African nation of Tunisia .
Three people died in the clashes between protesters and police , according to Egypt 's official MENA news agency .
Two demonstrators died in the eastern city of Suez , and one policeman was killed in Cairo , it said .
MENA reported that at least 49 people have been injured .
Earlier , Egypt 's Interior Ministry said that 36 police officers had been hurt during the protests .
Throngs in the sprawling capital city marched from the huge Tahrir Square toward the parliament building , according to CNN reporters on the scene .
Demonstrators threw rocks at police , and police hurled rocks back .
Tear - gas canisters were shot at demonstrators , and the protesters threw them back .
Protest organizers said they hope to capture the regional momentum for political change set by Tunisians , who <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-01-16">10 days ago</TIMEX3> forced the collapse of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali 's 23 - year rule .
Government : Keep protests in perspective Egyptian protesters run from smoke Gallery :
Protesters on streets in Cairo The grievances were foreshadowed by several Egyptians who set themselves or tried to set themselves on fire <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2011-01">this month</TIMEX3> , mirroring the self - immolation of a Tunisian man whose action spurred the uprising there .
The Tunisian uprising was the most successful revolt in the region since <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="1979">1979</TIMEX3> , but it is anybody 's guess whether uprisings will spread to other Arabic - speaking lands .
Juan Cole , a Middle East historian at the University of Michigan , says Tunisia is different from other Arab nations .
Tunisia , he said , is the ` ` most secular country in the Arab world . ''
Its traditions have favored women 's rights , and its Islamist influence is negligible .
The United States and other governments are monitoring the demonstrations in Cairo and elsewhere closely .
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urged all people to ` ` exercise restraint '' and supported ` ` the fundamental right of expression and assembly for all people . ''
` ` But our assessment is that the Egyptian government is stable and is looking for ways to respond to the legitimate needs and interests of the Egyptian people , '' she said .
To highlight the role of police corruption , the protest organizers in Egypt picked <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2011-01-25">January 25</TIMEX3> -- Police Day and a national holiday -- to hold protests .
The protests started off small , but they grew as people came to the center of the city from bridges over the Nile River .
Thousands protest corruption in Egypt Could Tunisia 's unrest spread to Egypt ?
Tear gas fired at Cairo protesters Witnesses said large groups of plainclothes police were heading to Tahrir Square .
Protesters had been expressing their anger over the rising cost of living , failed economic policies and corruption , but all those concerns were distilled into one overriding demand : the resignation of President Hosni Mubarak , in power for <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P3DE">three decades</TIMEX3> .
The outpouring included young and old , Christians and Muslims , students , workers and businesspeople .
` ` We breathe corruption in the air , '' said one demonstrator , who along with others said their children have no future .
At its peak there were perhaps 15,000 to 20,000 people in Tahrir Square , but that crowd later dwindled to about 5,000 to 8,000 .
The main road in front of parliament , Qasr Al - Aini , was closed to traffic .
The square is two blocks from parliament .
` ` Egyptians have the right to express themselves , '' Foreign Ministry spokesman Hossam Zaki said of the protests .
The Interior Ministry called on demonstrators to follow the law and avoid threatening the safety of bystanders , the public and private property .
Social media have been all - important in mobilizing and organizing protests .
But bloggers and others in Egypt reported problems with electronic communication later in the day .
Activists ca n't access their cell phones or text messages , and opposition websites ca n't be accessed .
Twitter was blocked in Egypt <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="TIME" value="2011-01-25T11:00" mod="APPROX">about 11 a.m.</TIMEX3> ET , the company said .
There were other demonstrations in Cairo suburbs of Heliopolis , Shubra Al - Khaima , Muhandasin and Dar Al - Salam .
One man said Egypt is not Tunisia , it 's Romania under Nicolae Ceausescu , a reference to the late and much - reviled communist leader .
The Front to Defend Egypt Protesters , an alliance of lawyers who helped organize the events , said that about 200 demonstrators were in the southern city of Aswan , 2,000 in the eastern city of Ismailiya and about 3,000 in the northern city of Mahallah .
The Egyptian government did not issue permits for <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2011-01-25">Tuesday</TIMEX3> 's planned protests .
In an interview released <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2011-01-25">Tuesday</TIMEX3> with state - run al - Ahram newspaper , Interior Minister Habib Adly warned that ` ` the security agencies are able to stop any attempt to attend '' the demonstrations and called the efforts of the ` ` youth staging street protests ineffective . ''
By <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="TIME" value="2011-01-25TMO" mod="START">early Tuesday morning</TIMEX3> , more than 90,000 people throughout the country had pledged to participate in the Facebook event ` ` We Are All Khaled Said , '' named after an Alexandria activist who was allegedly beaten to death by police .
The Facebook group demands raising the minimum wage , firing the interior minister , creating two - term presidential term limits and scrapping existing emergency laws that the group says ` ` resulted in police control '' over the people and the nation .
Amnesty International released a statement <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2011-01-24">Monday</TIMEX3> ` ` urging the Egyptian authorities not to crack down '' on the planned nationwide demonstration .
The banned Muslim Brotherhood , the biggest organized opposition to Mubarak 's regime , had stated it would not have an official presence at <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2011-02-01">Tuesday</TIMEX3> 's protests , but some of its members ` ` have reportedly been summoned and threatened with arrest and detention '' if they attend and protest , Amnesty International said .
Opposition leader and Nobel Peace laureate Mohamed ElBaradei posted statements supporting the protests on his Twitter account .
He also created a video statement addressing policemen that was released <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2011-01-24">Monday</TIMEX3> on YouTube .
` ` I sympathize with you because sometimes you are asked to do things that you do not want to do , '' ElBaradei said .
` ` <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DURATION" value="P1D">One day</TIMEX3> , I hope that you will regain your role as the protectors of the people ; rather than protectors of ... fraud elections .
I am sure that every one of you deep inside is looking forward to the day that his role will again be with the people and a part of them , rather than against them , '' he said .
Public sentiment against state security forces has grown <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> with alleged videos of police brutality shown on the internet .

A <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> report from Human Rights Watch said the problem is ` ` epidemic , '' and ` ` in most cases , officials torture detainees to obtain information and coerce confessions , occasionally leading to death in custody . ''
Some other human rights groups , such as the Arabic Network for Human Rights , have drawn a comparison between Egypt and Tunisia under Ben Ali , in terms of the level of government corruption and police brutality .
Adly , the Egyptian interior minister , dismissed any such comparisons , calling it ` ` propaganda '' that had been rejected by politicians as ` ` intellectual immaturity . ''
But one woman , identified only as Nahla , who planned to attend the <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2011-01-25">Tuesday</TIMEX3> protests , disagreed .
She wrote in an online post , ` ` I hope the -LRB- Tunisia - style -RRB- revolution will be taught in history .

And that Egyptians will learn in school later about the <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2011-01-25">January 25th</TIMEX3> revolution . ''
