Greece has sent military aircraft to evacuate 215 Greeks from Egypt , the official Athens News Agency said .
My thought is that people should fight for their freedom , because if not they would never be free . .

Obama has praised the cause -LCB- Egyptian President -RCB- in <TIMEX3 tid="t262" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3> possibly instigating the protests .
Right on buddy and my friend !
The Egyptians will not win .
The US\/Israel will not allow it .
If these protests achieve a revolution , then the Muslim Brotherhood will prevail .
The US will not allow this .
That is why the strategy <TIMEX3 tid="t263" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> is to calmly make Mubarak step down , as this way the government itself needs not change .
If on the other hand , Mubarak is forced out so will the <TIMEX3 tid="t264" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> government , and a true revolution will follow .
