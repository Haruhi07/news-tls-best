CNN -RRB- --
A record crowd in Cairo 's Tahrir Square swelled <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="TIME" value="2011-02-01TAF">Tuesday afternoon</TIMEX3> , a sea of Egyptians from every walk of life in a demonstration dubbed the ` ` march of millions . ''
Tens of thousands prayed on their knees on the asphalt in unison under the sprawling city 's <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2011-WI">winter</TIMEX3> sun , and then chanted ` ` leave , leave '' in a deafening roar to their president , Hosni Mubarak .
As the throngs congregated , Egypt 's Nile TV showed live pictures of car traffic crossing a bridge over the Nile River , with bulletins announcing that a curfew would be imposed again on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011-02-01">Tuesday</TIMEX3> starting at <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="TIME" value="2011-02-01T15:00">3 p.m.</TIMEX3> Soldiers and plain - clothed security officers searched demonstrators and controlled access to Tahrir , or Liberation Square , which has been the focal point of protests against Egypt 's embattled Mubarak , 82 .
After the first lines of security , scores of self - appointed volunteers from the protest movement conducted their own searches of bags , and ordered arriving people to show their identity cards as they streamed in .
One man handed out leaflets , urging demonstrators to behave in front of foreign journalists covering the event .
` <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2011-03">March</TIMEX3> of millions ' in Cairo Protester : ` We 're here for the future ' Protesters camp out in Cairo Gallery :
Protesters on streets in Egypt ` ` As you know all media organizations are here to follow your efforts , '' the leaflet read , ` ` In order to show Egypt in a positive light , we insist that you follow a peaceful approach in expressing your requests and ideas . ''
Men and women continued a practice that has sprung up here over <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2011-W04">the last week</TIMEX3> ... standing alone in the street , holding up hand - made signs , and posing proudly for the cell phone photos of passers - by .
` ` Mubarak has been here since Ronald Reagan , '' shouted one man , who held up a sign that said ` ` Get Out Mubarak '' in English .
Said El Sisi , 23 , said he and his father and brother traveled <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="PT2H">two hours</TIMEX3> on five different buses from their village outside Cairo to attend the demonstration .
` ` I 'd like to see change in my country , '' El Sisi said , as he walked slowly with hordes of people through security checkpoints towards the square .
` ` I 'd like to see a president in Egypt <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="SET" value="P8Y" quant="EVERY">every eight years</TIMEX3> like in other countries .
...
this is just the country of rich people .
I graduated from university and I speak four languages
but I ca n't find a job because of nepotism and corruption .
To do anything you have to pay money . ''
Many Egyptian opposition parties have embraced <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2011-02-01">today</TIMEX3> 's demonstration , which was promoted through fliers and leaflets , since the government has shut down almost all of the internet connections in the country .
` ` <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2011-02-01">Today</TIMEX3> we are all together in Tahrir Square , '' said George Issac , a member of the opposition group Kefaya , which means ` ` Enough '' in English .
` ` This revolution is a revolution of the young generation .
We are just supporters , '' Issac said .
He claimed Egypt 's long repressed opposition parties were working together with one goal , to remove President Hosni Mubarak .
In another part of Cairo , an aide to Ayman Nour said the former opposition candidate for president was holding talks with officials from the liberal secular opposition Al Wafd party .
` ` You can not call us Kefaya or Muslim Brotherhood or leftists or anything , '' Issac explained .
` ` We talk <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2011-02-01">today</TIMEX3> as Egyptians . ''
But Issac also said his party opposed the announced goal of some demonstrators , who planned to march from Tahrir Square to the Presidential Palace .
` ` I send a message for all the demonstrators .
Do n't leave the square , '' Issac said , in a telephone interview with CNN .
A march of tens of thousands of people , if not more , would put the protesters in tense confrontations with the Egyptian troops who have established checkpoints throughout the city .
At the outskirts of Tahrir Square , army officers drove a truck blaring patriotic music from loudspeakers .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2011-01-31">Monday</TIMEX3> , the military announced it would not use force against the demonstrators .
` ` The presence of the armed forces in the Egyptian streets is for your benefit to protect your safety and peace , '' an unnamed military spokesman announced on state television <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="TIME" value="2011-01-31TNI">Monday night</TIMEX3> .
` ` Your armed forces will not use violence against this great people , who have always played a significant role in every moment of Egypt 's great history . ''
And deeper in the throngs of jubilant protesters , one of the men who searched arriving participants wore a camouflage military uniform underneath civilian pants and jacket in an apparent effort to blend in with the crowd .
