By the CNN Wire Staff Protesters have embraced Egyptian troops since they were deployed on the streets
This is in sharp contrast toward how they ' ve approached the much reviled national police
The military is well represented in Mubarak 's government An expert says the military must decide how to keep order without antagonizing the public -LRB- CNN
-RRB- --
When tens of thousands hit the streets to decry an authoritarian regime -- calling for its overthrow , trying to overrun police , setting fires -- one might expect the arrival of army tanks would be met with fear , consternation and violence .

The warm embrace that demonstrators gave troops <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2011-W04">this week</TIMEX3> illustrated the military 's respected and central role in Egyptian society .
This fact makes the armed forces potentially a kingmaker in the <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> crisis , while also showcasing its challenge to somehow re - establish security without undermining its popularity .
` ` How they behave on the streets is going to matter a whole lot , '' said Shibley Telhami , a Middle East expert and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution think tank .
` ` That 's going to be the dilemma : Can they maintain the order without antagonizing the public that they need ? ''
The ascendance began in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="1952">1952</TIMEX3> , when the military helped overthrow Egypt 's ruling monarch .
Its support for a constitutional democracy and its performance in various wars and battles earned it the admiration of many Egyptians .
Celebrations mix wth violence in Cairo ` ` There 's a good reason that the Egyptian military is held in pretty high esteem , '' said Peter Bergen , a CNN national security analyst , author and fellow at New York University 's Center on Law and Security .
` ` The army has done relatively well . ''
All males between ages 18 and 30 must serve <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">one</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P3Y">three years</TIMEX3> , as the CIA World Factbook notes , meaning almost every family in Egypt has some personal connection to the military .
Still , one of the military 's biggest assets in the eyes of everyday Egyptians may be that it is not the widely reviled security force .
The U.S. State Department has frequently blasted Egyptian police for torture and otherwise depriving citizens of their civil rights , including in its most <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3> Human Rights Report .
` ` They 're held in great disdain by their own population , for very good reason , '' Bergen said .
` ` They know that security forces have tortured literally thousands of people ... for almost any reason . ''
This animosity boiled over <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2011-W04">this week</TIMEX3> , when angry demonstrators burned and ransacked police stations .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2011-01-28">Friday</TIMEX3> , there were reports of casualties after police fought back citizens ' attempts to take the Interior Ministry in Cairo , the security forces ' headquarters .
Just blocks away , in Tahrir Square , it was a very different and far more festive scene : Joyous demonstrators gathered near troops and embraced them , sometimes literally .
This showering of love on the military , which were deployed <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2011-01-28">Friday</TIMEX3> to patrol the streets for the first time since <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="198" mod="MID">the mid-1980s</TIMEX3> was repeated many times over throughout Egypt .
Video footage from Cairo showed some protesters celebrating by scaling tanks , with no repercussions .
Many of them smiled and shook hands with troops on patrol , with one soldier even cradling a baby and posing for a picture .
In Alexandria , where at least 2,000 gathered in Raml Square on <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2011-01-29">Saturday</TIMEX3> , protesters chanted , ` ` The military and the people together will change the regime . ''
That said , these same demonstrators were demanding the overthrow of President Mubarak -- a former hero in the Air Force and the commander - in - chief of the armed forces .
He has largely surrounded himself politically with other veterans , including <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2011-01-29">Saturday</TIMEX3> 's appointment of Omar Suleiman -LRB- a former lieutenant general in the army -RRB- as vice president , the first time Mubarak has tapped someone for that role in his <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="P30Y">30 years</TIMEX3> in power .
Experts are n't surprised Mubarak has moved to align himself with the military even more so , recognizing the armed forces ' place in Egypt .
Still , by doing so , he also created a quandary for the military : Do they back Mubarak , whom they report to ?
Or do they support the people , having largely been among them not long ago and wanting to preserve their reputation ?
Andrew Pierre , a senior fellow at the U.S. Institute of Peace , said he expects top military officials to remain loyal to the president .

But the rank and file are a different story , especially if they are called on to beat back civilians .
` ` They 're military people for <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">two years</TIMEX3> or so , and I do n't know that they will be willing to shoot their brothers and sisters and families on the streets , '' Pierre said , adding that midlevel officers may be most torn and ultimately determine what happens .
Through the first <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DURATION" value="P5D">five days</TIMEX3> of the crisis , the 450,000 - strong armed forces appeared to trying to have it both ways : refraining from acting against demonstrators , but at the same time vowing to bring order .
Still , even as it vowed to enforce a curfew from <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="TIME" value="2011-01-29T16:00">4 p.m. Saturday</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="TIME" value="2011-01-30T08:00">8 a.m. Sunday</TIMEX3> , there were no signs of the military doing anything to the hundreds who roamed the streets regardless .
Telhami , though , thinks that ultimately the military may have to decide where it stands : behind Mubarak or the protesters .

And their decision , many believe , will determine Egypt 's future .
` ` It 's all going to depend ...
on where the military will be , '' he said .
