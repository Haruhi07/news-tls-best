and only poor judgments can make people so angry I was probably the only one in the north or perhaps in the world who were with demonstrators States the reason why I left , I hope Egypt will have a better future A lot of pictures also pictures of myself with banner and Egyptian flags as demonstrators against the regime The riots in Egypt organized by Obama , Iran and the Muslim Brotherhood Mohamed Mustafa ElBaradei the Iranian traitor , the Muslim Brotherhood and Iran want to rule Egypt .
They want Repression of women , prohibition of education , high unemployment , radical Islam as Iran , Somalia and Afghanistan under Taliban rule ...

After <TIMEX3 tid="t159" type="DURATION" value="PXM">some months</TIMEX3> the Islamic extremists will take the POWER and people will be in worst situation then before ...
Do the people in Iran , Somalia , Afghanistan want the Extremists to rule ?
A call to all those who are K.B.E. , enjoy your cup or Tea .
A man of Peace will attain rank , his rank will be 10 bars of gold .
In the Royal Navy , a part of their sleeve insignia is the Circle of Life , incorporated with rank .
In the American Navy , a five pointed star is incorporated in their sleeve insignia along with their rank .
At present the Common Wealth is at war , a captain has 4 bars of gold on each shoulder board , a total of 8 bar of gold .
Add 1 bar of gold to each shoulder board and you attain the rank of Commadore , a war time rank , a Silver Star .
Let the ` ` Wise Men of the East '' follow the brightest burning star in the western sky .
If a true Democrocy is allowed to be established in the nation of Egypt , there is a good chance that Isreals southern flank will remain alligned with a friendly government .
Many milenia ago , Moses led the Isrealites out of Egypt and while in the Sinai , a burning bush became a sign post .
Days ago , I saw a burning bush in the Sinai .
Jordan ceeded the West Bank to Isreal , is it <TIMEX3 tid="t160" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> time for Isreal to ceed Gaza to Egypt ?
Not all Crowns will fall , yet the 12 Tribes of Isreal will reunite .

If President Barrack Obama is instramental in establishing a ` ` True Democracy '' in Egypt , where All are given a voice in government , and ALL are allowed to worship freely , he will truely earn a Prize for PEACE , A Nobel jesture ... ...
The youth of the Brotherhood of Islam will take care of the ` ` Khalif of Persia '' .
If Isreal is to remain a true Democracy , the nation will need to maintain a majority of the populations vote .
In a true Democracy , ALL religions of the world are allowed to worship .
Isreal will maintain control of The Holy City , but All will be allowed to worship freely .
All the Religions of the World .
A cornerstone of PEACE in the region will be established if a President is <TIMEX3 tid="t163" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> set , a President of limited Reign .
If the manuver is pulled off properly , Egypt will be an example for the Brothers of Islam , and All the Wise Men of the East will be able to arrive at their destination , The Holy City .
This manuver will benefit the American taxpayer the most , if we can eliminate AIDE to Egypt , Palestine , Isreal , Irac , Afghanistan , and Pakistan ; and remove a standing army in the region for decades to come , we will be able to AIDE the american tax payer in the furture .
Hopefully we will not have to raid the programs we have all paid into .
Commerce is King , weather you call it a King or a President .
Weather your business is ` ` manna from heaven ' or BLACK GOLD , business will be conducted .
A powerful standing army in the region is much more for control than for National Security .
Control of the Black Gold , and you must transit this to conduct your commerce .
Business men will always conduct their business , especially if they are among friends and brothers .
Give the Brotherhood of Islam an example they can ALL follow .
The Egyptians in Tahrir Square want a true Democracy , it is what they are asking for .
A proper transition will take time and work .
Mubarak is out at the end of this term , but in a true Democracy , he and his family would be allowed to stay in the country .
The wealth of the Mubarak Family could do wonders for the commerce of Egypt .
A call to all those who are K.B.E. , enjoy your cup of Tea , and let the ` ` Circle of Life '' be unbroken ... ... ... ...
A message to the children of Abraham .
To the kindom of Isreal , You know David was a soldier before he was a profit and a king .
To you I give Control of the Holy City .
To the Brotherhood of Islam , you know Muhamed was a soldier before he was a profit and a king .
To you I give Great Wealth , BLACK GOLD .
To the Brotherhood of Christ , I give you the Power to Enforce your Will , this is a Great Responsability .
Ensure your children and grand children are able to celebrate the Holy Day of <TIMEX3 tid="t164" type="DATE" value="2011-12-25">Christmas</TIMEX3> as you have .
A call to all those who are K.B.E. , enjoy your cup of Tea , and let the ` ` Circle of Life '' be unbroken .
