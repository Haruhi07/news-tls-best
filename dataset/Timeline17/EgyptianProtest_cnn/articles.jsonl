'' \nBut President Mubarak is not one to go off scurrying into the night . \nIt was a speech both defiant and patronizing . \nRemarkably , Mubarak managed to say all the wrong things at precisely the wrong time . \nThe feelings of jubilation , much in evidence yesterday , have turned once again to anger . \nEgypt is consumed by uncertainty and confusion . \nThere is a sense in the streets here that today could prove decisive . \nBut that 's what protesters said about previous `` days of rage , '' each of which re-confirmed the strength of this protest movement but failed to deliver a decisive blow to a stubborn president . \nThe military will come under growing pressure to choose between the regime it has long supported and the hundreds of thousands of Egyptians who are demanding genuine change . \nIt is a difficult choice , but one it may very soon be forced to make . \nOtherwise , Egypt is likely to settle into a dangerous pattern : continuous civil conflict with no resolution in sight . \nEllis Goldberg , professor of political science at the University of Washington and visiting professor of political science at the American University in Cairo : As with most of Mubarak 's speeches since the political crisis began , this one was a mix of pathos , defiance and threat . \nHe asserted that the committee he appointed to propose constitutional reform will have only limited scope and will be able to make it possible to end the state of emergency . \nHe did not offer to end it himself . \nHe rejected any far-reaching reform , such as his own departure , as foreign-inspired . \nTen days ago , Mubarak 's proposals might have worked . \nNo longer : None of the protesters trusts the president or any of his associates . \nBesides his remaining in power , he also made it clear that there would be no change in the overall system over which he has presided -- no change in government regulation of political parties , no changes to enhance the independence of the judiciary and no changes in the power of the office of president . \nAnger at Mubarak is deepening and widening . \nWorkers , including 24,000 at a large factory in the industrial belt of the Delta , are going on strike . \nLeading professional figures openly oppose the government . \nOne prominent judge has argued that the constitution need not be amended but can be rewritten in Tahrir Square . \nProtesters react to Mubarak speech What Mubarak is telling Egyptians Ambassador : Mubarak no longer has power ElBaradei : Army must save Egypt Mubarak did clearly say one true thing in his speech : The people of Egypt are in a ditch . \nThey agree , but they see him as the person who put them there and has prevented them from getting out . \nOn Friday , even larger protests will happen , and at some point , then or soon after , the army will have to decide how this all ends . \nEither it will let the protesters overwhelm key locations of authority , or it will use force to prevent it . \nFriday promises to be yet another big day in Cairo . \nThis was the voice of old-school authoritarianism . \nIt is the classic response of Arab leaders when faced with an internal threat . \nThey raise the specter of foreign interference , they label attacks on the regime as attacks on the people , they identify with the pain of the `` masses , '' and they position themselves as the ultimate defenders of the nation 's glory . \nThese are two men tone-deaf to the roar of the crowd . \nBoth of these speeches were thick with the language and cadence of the paternalistic past . \nAs one Egyptian tweeted moments after Mubarak 's speech , `` Father knows best . '' \nThe Egyptian president cloaked himself in the robes of the pharaohs , to which he is so often likened by his critics , invoking Egypt 's 7,000-year history and insisting that he `` will not accept or listen to any foreign interventions or dictations . '' \nPicking up on the same theme , Suleiman lectured `` the young people , heroes of Egypt , '' telling them to return home . \n`` Do not listen to the satellite stations that have no objective but to weaken Egypt and mar its image , '' he said . \n`` It is not about me , '' Mubarak said . \nAnd chants of `` leave , leave , leave ! '' \nthat erupted from the protesters in Tahrir the moment they realized he was not stepping down made that clear . \nThe idea that he is ceding some unspecified powers to Suleiman will simply not cut it with the masses on the streets . \nThe future of Egypt now lies with the Army . \nThe generals must now be weighing where their own long-term interests lie . \nWith more mass protests planned for tomorrow , the choice is clear : Turn on the people or tell the old man it is time to go . \nMarina Ottaway , director of the Middle East program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace : Mubarak 's defiant Thursday speech has done nothing to prolong his tenure in power . \nOn the contrary , it has made protesters even more determined to oust him , greatly decreased the already slim probability that Suleiman will be an acceptable interlocutor to members of the opposition and increased the probability of a military takeover . \nA tumultuous day in Egypt Cairo protesters on the move Obama reacts to Mubarak 's speech Suleiman 's brief speech after Mubarak 's address , in which he encouraged the protesters to go home and go back to work , was equally out of touch with the mood in the country . \nDelivered while growing crowds of demonstrators in Cairo and Alexandria kept up the chant of `` go , go '' that had started as soon as it became clear Mubarak was not going to resign , the exhortation for calm was futile at best . \nDemonstrations on Friday will be huge as a result and will not abate in the following days . \nSuleiman is unlikely to find participants for continuing dialogue among members of the opposition . \nAt this point , the army appears to be the only organization that can break the impasse . \nThursday morning , the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces , meeting without Mubarak , issued Communiqu Number One , pledging to continue searching for `` possible actions and measures to safeguard the aspirations of the Egyptian people . '' \nStay tuned for Communiqu Number Two . \nAs the maneuvering in Cairo continues , it is increasingly clear that the military will play a broad role in any process of transition -- much more than just maintaining security . \nIt is also expected to oversee the opening of the political system and the restructuring of the economy . \nHowever , there is no evidence that the military supports democracy or even considers it a good idea . \nIndeed , much of the political elite , of which the officer corps is a part , is skeptical of the desirability of open political competition . \nThey fear that it might be exploited by charismatic populist leaders -- particularly Islamists . \nA key question going forward is whether the military will allow free and fair elections that include peaceful Islamic groups . \nIf it does not , the legitimacy of a democratic transition will be seriously undermined . \nThe military may also be an ambivalent supporter of economic reform . \nIt has huge economic interests that include vast swaths of land and factories that produce everything from bread to refrigerators . \nAny serious effort at economic reform must reduce the military 's role in the civilian economy . \nWill the generals allow this restructuring to go forward , even when it challenges their economic interests ? \nIsobel Coleman , author of '' Paradise Beneath Her Feet '' and a senior fellow for U.S. foreign policy at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York : Thursday began as a day of great anticipation for Egyptians . \nThe army heightened expectations by announcing that the protestors ' demands would be met . \nEgyptian activist Wael Ghonim galvanized the crowds by tweeting `` mission accomplished '' to his followers . \nA mood of euphoria spread among the growing crowd in Tahrir Square over the notion that Mubarak would step down . \nThat mood quickly turned ugly as his televised comments made clear he was digging in his heels , reiterating that he would die on Egypt 's soil . \nAgain , Mubarak defied those who call for his departure . \nEven had Mubarak stepped down on Thursday , it would have met only the first of the protesters ' demands . \nThey seek the removal of the entire regime and wholesale constitutional change . \nMeanwhile , the regime continues to try to spin the story . \nIn his address , Mubarak appealed to the people , saying that the blood of martyrs would not be wasted and that he would not bow to foreign intervention . \nSuleiman echoed him , calling for unity and an end to chaos and rejecting the messages on satellite television -- in other words , go home and be quiet . \nThursday proved yet again that we should expect the unexpected . \nBut it is also clear that the protesters are not going to heed Suleiman 's words any time soon . \nKenneth Roth , executive director of Human Rights Watch : Pro-democracy protesters have every reason to distrust Mubarak , whose strategy has been to stall long enough to orchestrate a controlled transition in which the dictator may change but the dictatorship remains intact . \nHis aloof , out-of-touch speech did nothing to suggest a change of heart . \nWhoever remains atop the Egyptian government , concrete steps are needed immediately to lay the groundwork for free , competitive elections . \nThe stalling tactics must end . \nRather than claim that Egyptians are `` not ready '' for democracy -- Suleiman 's line -- the government should urgently lift the decades-old state of emergency and repeal laws that give the Interior Ministry broad powers to arrest and detain persons and limit the rights to freedom of speech , association and peaceful assembly . \nBy the same token , the attacks on demonstrators that have been sponsored and tolerated by the government must end , as should the ongoing detentions , mistreatment and torture , with serious abuses investigated and prosecuted . \nTo make elections meaningful , a committee that is genuinely independent of the government -- not Mubarak 's hand-picked cronies -- should be given authority to make the necessary legal and constitutional changes , to register political parties and to ensure that the basic freedoms of all competitors are respected . \nOnly these broad changes , enacted now , will ensure a genuine democratic transition , not just a new dictatorship . \nAfter decades of backing Mubarak , the United States and European Union governments should finally put the wishes of the Egyptian people first and use the considerable leverage provided by their massive aid to insist on these changes immediately . \nMubarak 's delusional efforts to reduce the democracy movement to foreign pressure show that he is feeling the heat . \nNow is the time to turn up the temperature . \nAfter Mubarak 's disappointingly tone-deaf speech to the people of Egypt on Thursday evening , events there could swell in a more outraged direction . \nStill , we must not lose sight of the longer-term dynamic for which we need to be prepared . \nAmerica needs to radically rethink its Egypt strategy . \nRemember that no matter who the civilian leader of Egypt is , its military -- America 's putative ally and client -- is still the most powerful institution behind the scenes . \nEven so , this is the time for the U.S. to reach out and establish working relationships across the spectrum of Egyptian politics . \nOnly by playing all sides -- even working with the Muslim Brotherhood -- can the U.S. be assured that it is not caught off-guard without any connections or leverage with whomever prevails in future Egyptian elections . \nPeople power is a lot more complicated than having one `` son of a bitch '' who answers the West 's calls , but that 's the price of democracy . \nIt 's not enough that the next president of Egypt not be Mubarak or Suleiman . \nIt 's far more important that the next president -- and every president thereafter -- not be a military strongman or authoritarian despot . \nThis can happen only through genuine constitutional reform . \nWhat so often holds back political progress -- for example , in countries like Ukraine -- is that the constitution is a chessboard on which the same few players constantly shift the rules to make sure that their portfolio reigns . \nIndeed , Mubarak has at most partially transferred some authority to the vice president , but power still resides with him and the military . \nInstead , Egypt 's constitutional system must be converted from a president republic to a parliamentary democracy . \nThis means the power must rest with a prime minister and with several independent political parties below . \nFor all the gridlock of parliamentary systems , we should still prefer that Egypt look like more like Italy than Algeria . \n"}

'' \nTantawi , who holds the title `` field marshal , '' received his first military commission in 1956 , He was born on October 31 , 1935 , and fought in Egypt 's 1956 war against Britain , France and Israel . \nHe also served during Egypt 's conflicts with Israel in 1967 and 1973 . \nTantawi was only recently made deputy prime minister . \nFormer President Hosni Mubarak appointed him to the position during the early days of the protest movement that eventually forced Mubarak from power . \nSince 1991 , Tantawi has held the position of defense minister , wielding near-exclusive decision-making power within the ministry . \nHowever , during that time , `` the tactical and operational readiness of the Egyptian Armed Forces has degraded , '' according to globalsecurity.org , a military analysis group . \nProtester ` not that worried ' about army U.S. Embassy cables released by WikiLeaks contain multiple references to Tantawi , his relationship with Mubarak and they way he is viewed by other Egyptian military officials . \nAnother quoted an unnamed Egyptian officer , who joked that Tantawi `` looks like a bureaucrat . '' \nThat cable went on to say he is openly mocked at clubs in Cairo where midlevel officers gather . \nThe cable claimed these officers mock him openly as `` incompetent '' and as `` Mubarak 's poodle . '' \nThe officers also say that Tantawi 's unwavering loyalty to Mubarak is `` running the military into the ground , '' according to the cable . \nMost significant for the hopes of democratic-reform advocates in Egypt , the cables say that Tantawi has always supported the centralization of power in Egypt . \nOne cable says he has become `` increasingly intolerant of intellectual freedom . '' \nAnother goes into greater detail on his position . \n`` Tantawi has opposed both economic and political reforms that he perceives as eroding central government power , '' according to the cable . \n`` He is supremely concerned with national unity , and has opposed policy initiatives he views as encouraging political or religious cleavages with Egyptian society . '' \nHe has revealed a willingness to use the military to control political groups like the Muslim Brotherhood , the cables say , and opposes economic reform because it reduces the Egyptian government 's control over prices and production . \nThat cable 's final assessment of Tantawi warned diplomats to `` be prepared to meet an aged and change-resistant Tantawi . \n... He and Mubarak are focused on regime stability and maintaining the status quo through the end of their time . \nThey simply do not have the energy , inclination or world view to do anything differently .

Sifry , Special to CNN An Egyptian man holds up a sign praising Facebook , joining other protesters in Cairo 's Tahrir Square on February 1 . \nThe role of social media in the Egypt revolution is under debate Micah Sifry says the internet alone did n't end Mubarak 's regime He says tools such as Facebook and Twitter were key for the organizers of protests Combination of social media and repressive conditions puts harsh regimes at risk , he says -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- `` People protested and brought down governments before Facebook was invented . \nThey did it before the internet came along . '' \n`` This is the revolution of the youth of the internet , and now the revolution of all Egyptians . '' \nAs we watch , transfixed by the sights and sounds of jubilation in the streets of Egypt , the question on many people 's minds is : How did this happen ? \nBut a far better way to ask that question is : Who organized this , and how ? \nMovements for social change do n't just `` happen . '' \nToo often , the media reports on them the way we talk about the weather or chemistry : Protest is said to `` flare up , '' `` gather steam '' and `` boil . '' \nOther times movements are said to take a country `` by storm '' or `` peter out . '' \nHaving grown up on such empty descriptions , it 's not surprising that we 're hearing so much today about Egypt 's `` Facebook revolution '' or its `` Twitter revolution . '' \nLacking any real knowledge of the forces on the ground , too many media outlets have offered us a view from afar , where some shiny new tools of communication are made out to be more important than the people doing the communicating and the messages and tactics they have chosen to use . \nThe role of the internet in Egypt 's revolution has definitely been overstated . \nIf you look at the available data on the degree of internet penetration in the country as well as the number of mobile cellular subscriptions per 100 people , the percentage of population under age 15 and the degree of urbanization , some intriguing facts jump out . \nWithout the relatively free arena of online social networking sites ... young Egyptians like Ghonim could not have built the resilient and creative force that finally toppled Hosni Mubarak . \nInternet access in Egypt is barely 20 % , much less than Tunisia or Iran , according to InternetWorldStats.com . \nMobile phone usage is much higher , at about 40 % . \nEgypt is also a very young and urban society . \nAbout a third of the population is under 15 -LRB- compared to 25 % in Tunisia and 28 % in Iran -RRB- , says the Population Reference Bureau . \nAnd close to half live in cities , where the gap between rich and poor is more extreme and gratingly visible than in the rural parts of the country . \nThese elements -- a rising level of connectivity combined with an exploding population of young people facing declining economic prospects since the global recession began a few years ago -- are probably the most critical underlying factors explaining Egypt 's explosion . \nThat said , Google marketing executive Wael Ghonim has a point -- and Malcolm Gladwell 's dismissive comment about the role of social media in social change was a case of over-correcting for the media 's failings . \nThe internet has made a big difference in Egypt . \nFor years , the country 's secret police and state-controlled media have very effectively suppressed most dissident activities . \nWithout the relatively free arena of online social networking sites and tools like Facebook , Twitter and YouTube , young Egyptians like Ghonim could not have built the resilient and creative force that finally toppled Hosni Mubarak . \nAs he told CNN 's Wolf Blitzer on Friday , `` We would post a video on Facebook and it would be shared by 50,000 people on their walls in hours . '' \nAlternative media channels are absolutely vital for freedom movements . \nBut the `` youth of the internet '' were more than that . \nA nucleus of human rights activists , lawyers , bloggers and labor organizers have been hard at work for several years in Egypt , risking prison , holding small rallies and vigils , raising consciousness online by distributing pictures and video of torture victims , writing protest manuals , mobilizing lawyers to petition arrested comrades out of prison and studying the lessons of other failed uprisings -- like the protests after Iran 's 2009 election -- in order to develop more nimble and less controllable strategies to build their movement . \nAlong the way , they devised some ingenious hacks around the police state , like using mobile phones and Twitter to share information about imprisoned activists and using international phone lines for sending text messages . \nThey learned how to make more effective online videos with the help of Peter Gabriel 's human rights group Witness , and how to use open source mapping tools with the help of the Kenyan nongovernmental group Ushahidi . \nAs Maryam Ishani writes in Foreign Policy magazine , `` By the time the November 2010 elections -LRB- in Egypt -RRB- rolled around , a new mechanism was in place . '' \nThe theory was that widespread election fraud would set off an Iran-like wave of protests , but apparently Egyptians were inured to stolen elections . \nIt would take the events in Tunisia in December , where a peddler named Mohamed Bouazizi set himself on fire to protest corruption , stirring mass protests there -LRB- which were also organized by online social network activists -RRB- to finally push Egyptians into the streets . \n`` If you want to liberate a society , just give them the internet , '' Ghonim said Friday . \nWell , if you add a free and open internet to a society with a large number of young people , give a majority of them mobile phones , and fail to offer them any chance of economic and social advancement , you will have ripened the conditions for changing the world . \nBut small groups of dedicated and organized people still have to make it happen . \nLike Margaret Mead once said , nothing else ever has . \nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Micah L. Sifry . \n"}

'' \nIranian authorities on Wednesday warned against any attempt by the opposition movement to hold the rally , according to the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency . \nIt was unclear whether people will take to the streets , anyway . \n`` We definitely see them as enemies of the revolution and spies , and we will confront them with force , '' Revolutionary Guard Cmdr. Hossein Hamedani told IRNA . \nThe Iranian regime on Friday celebrated the 1979 revolution that dethroned the shah . \nOpposition leaders Mehdi Karroubi and Mir Hossein Moussavi asked that the rally take place in Tehran 's Azadi Square , the site of mass protests by Iran 's opposition movement after the disputed 2009 presidential elections . \nThe International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran , based in the United States , called Friday for an end to restrictions on the movements of Karroubi and Moussavi . \n`` The -LRB- Iranian -RRB- government is doing all it can to intimidate Iranians and deny their right to peaceful assembly , '' the U.S.-based group said in a statement . \n`` With recent events in Egypt , we see another round of repression in Iran aimed at silencing a people frustrated and dissatisfied by the denial of their human rights . '' \nObservers point to an interesting synergy between protests in Iran and Egypt . \nThey are waiting to see if what 's transpired in Egypt will ignite a substantial renewal of protests in Iran . \n`` I think that 's a very substantial possibility , '' Joshua Muravchik , a fellow at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies , told CNN Friday . \n`` I think that the Green Movement in part inspired what has happened in Egypt . \nObviously , Tunisia is the most recent inspiration . '' \n`` In June 2009 , when the Green Movement emerged , the internet was full of chatter by Egyptians sort of beating their breast saying , ` Why are we so lame ? \nLook at that : a million Iranians out on the street standing up to their government . \nWhy ca n't we do that ? ' '' \n`` And that sort of stuck with them -LRB- Egyptians -RRB- , I believe , '' said Muravchik . \n`` They kept having these small demonstrations and somehow it finally started to gather momentum and the snowball turned quickly into an avalanche . '' \n`` There 's no guarantee though that it will work in the reverse direction , '' he said , referring to Iran . \nThe disputed 2009 presidential election sparked widespread outrage within the Islamic republic , thrusting the depths of Iranian society into the global spotlight and inciting violence that had n't been seen in decades . \nIran quelled the demonstrations with a brutal crackdown against the peaceful street protests and the arrests of hundreds of activists , reformists and opposition figures . \nA diverse opposition movement -- headed by reform candidates Moussavi and Karroubi -- grew into today 's Green Movement , protesting for social justice , freedom and democracy . \nExperts interviewed by CNN said they believe Jordan , Bahrain and Yemen will likely see significant democratic changes before Iran , and each face different circumstances . \nThe United States on Friday slammed Iran 's `` hypocrisy '' for arresting opposition figures and the blocking of world media outlets and websites . \n`` For all of its empty talk about Egypt , the government of Iran should allow the Iranian people the same universal right to peacefully assemble , demonstrate and communicate in Tehran that the people are exercising in Cairo , '' National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor said . \nIranian leaders praised the Egyptian and Tunisian uprisings and said they were reminiscent of the 1979 Iranian revolution that toppled the shah and ushered in a hard-line and theocratic Islamic republic . \nAbbas Milani , director of Iranian Studies at Stanford University , said the Middle East is at a `` crucial tipping point . '' \nIf democratic voices and a government prevail in Egypt , he told CNN , Iran will feel an uptick in internal pressure to reform . \nBut , he and others said , there is a singular difference between Egypt and Iran . \nThe Egyptian military , while key to power in the country , did not clash with its citizens . \nIran 's Revolutionary Guard Corps -LRB- IRGC -RRB- was established after the Islamic Revolution to defend the regime against all threats . \nThe IRGC and its `` thugs '' have repressed Iranians , Milani said . \nThe Iranian military is not as well equipped and as politically oriented as the IRGC and played little , if any , part in the 2009 crackdown . \n`` I think they knew the military could not be depended upon '' because they might side with protesters , Milani said of the Iranian government . \nThe IRGC has `` expanded far beyond its original mandate , '' according to the Council on Foreign Relations , a U.S. foreign policy research center . \n`` Today the guard has evolved into a socio-military-political-economic force with influence reaching deep into Iran 's power structure , '' the CFR says , noting that several current and former IRGC members have been appointed to positions as ambassadors , mayors , undersecretaries , provincial governors and cabinet ministers . \nMohamad Bazzi , adjunct senior fellow for Middle Eastern Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations , said the IRGC will stand behind President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who helped consolidate their influence . \nAnd Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has shown no signs of abandoning Ahmadinejad , Bazzi said . \nMilani does n't expect the Iranian regime to allow large protests , but he believes `` major changes '' and an `` unstoppable democratic wind '' eventually will come to the republic . \nIran also must address significant economic problems , he added . \n`` The Iranian society has profoundly changed , `` he said . \n`` The regime has not . '' \nAli Alfoneh , a resident fellow at the conservative but non-partisan American Enterprise Institute , said he does n't expect to see major reforms in Iran , at least in the short term , but he believes dissidents were heartened by the Egyptian revolution . \n`` The Green Movement was almost dead and it has become energized , '' he told CNN Friday . \nGallery : Protesters celebrate Mubarak 's resignation Woolsey : Next step marks Egypt 's fate Ghonim : Facebook to thank for freedom `` Revolutions take defections , '' Alfoneh said . \nRapid changes in Egypt and the region make it difficult to predict what might happen in Iran , Bazzi said . \n`` Surviving the last round -LRB- of protests -RRB- strengthened the regime 's hand , '' he said . \nThe suppression `` put fear in the protesters , '' he said . \nTo succeed , the Green Movement will have to reach out to opponents and `` to the millions who are silent , '' said Bazzi , a member of the faculty at New York University . \nReal change may not occur until the next presidential election , he said . \nStill , the Iranian regime is probably somewhat concerned after what happened in Egypt . \n`` They are crushing anything that moves , '' Bazzi said . \nIsobel Coleman , a senior fellow for U.S. foreign policy at the Council for Foreign Relations , said one big difference between Iran and Egypt are their economies . \nIran has a lot of oil , and it can afford to be `` more reactionary and revolutionary . '' \nMeanwhile , the Obama administration will continue to pressure Iran over its nuclear program , human rights and influence with militant organizations that threaten Israel , among other governments . \nFormer Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin on Friday questioned the White House 's handling of Iran . \n`` Media : ask `` Will Obama Admin exert as much ` constructive ' pressure on Iranian govt to change & allow freedom -- as they just did for Egypt ? \n, '' she wrote on her Twitter account . \nAs the world turns its attention to Iran , especially in the coming days , questions remain on whether governments can change and still hold on to power . \n`` The experience of the last days shows it is almost impossible to ask for democracy and not ask for a regime change , '' he said . \nCNN 's Joe Sterling , Samira Simone , Sarah Aarthun and Reza Sayah contributed to this report . \n"}

{"id": "237", "time": "2011-02-11", "text": "The future of Egypt could go in many different directions , analysts say Free and fair elections are the first step toward democracy Some fear the military will be loath to give up power when the time comes Pillars of the Mubarak regime are still in place and must be dealt with -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Amid the jubilant celebrations over Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak 's resignation Friday , analysts cautioned that the protest movement 's biggest challenges lie in the days ahead as the euphoria of revolution dies down and the reality of rebuilding a country sets in . \n`` Egypt 's problems began before Mubarak , and they will not end with his ouster , '' Kenneth Pollack , director of the Saban Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution , wrote in a commentary piece for CNN.com . \n`` Instead , they are the product of a corrupt , stagnant and oppressive system which Mubarak helped to build but now extends beyond his own person . '' \nWorld leaders have been pushing for an orderly transition since the protest movement first gained momentum late last month . \nThe calls grew only louder Friday after Egyptian Vice President Omar Suleiman made a somber one-minute announcement on state television announcing Mubarak 's resignation and the appointment of the Supreme Council of Armed Forces to `` run the affairs of the country . '' \nAmong other things , Egyptian authorities need to set about `` protecting the rights of Egypt 's citizens , lifting the emergency law , revising the constitution and other laws to make this change irreversible , and laying out a clear path to elections that are fair and free , '' U.S. President Barack Obama said Friday . \nIn the immediate future , the military -- largely respected by Egyptians -- will have to grapple with guiding the country of more than 80 million people through the transition amid massive problems of unemployment and considerable economic underdevelopment , said CNN correspondent Ben Wedeman , who is based in Cairo . \nOld Egypt dies , a new Egypt born `` All of that is going to pose quite a challenge , '' Wedeman said . \n`` They 're going to be learning along with the people of Egypt how to make a delicate transformation from a dictatorship to what everyone hopes is a democracy . '' \nOne fear is that the military will be loath to give up power in favor of a democratic system . \n`` Egypt has a long history of military rule , '' said Daniel Byman , a senior fellow on foreign policy for Brookings ' Saban Center . \n`` No one will be shocked if this military is not eager to pass things on to the Egyptian people . '' \nBut Byman also pointed out the solid reputation the military has among Egyptians . \nThroughout the uprising , the military both responded to the protesters and defended Mubarak 's regime , and many demonstrators had been calling for the army to take over as interim caretaker . \n`` The hope is that the military feels that its corporate image and pride will be destroyed if it created another dictatorship , '' Byman said . \nOne of the first things the military can do to show it has the interests of Egyptians in mind is lift the state of emergency -- used by Mubarak throughout his tenure as president to rule with an iron hand -- immediately , said Marco Vicenzino of the Global Strategy Project . \nThe military said Friday that it would be lifted , but only when conditions allowed . \nByman noted that while tanks are in the street and the emergency law is still in place , Egypt is still essentially operating as a police state -- one of the biggest objections of the nearly 3-week-old protest . \n`` The police are not there in the same repressive way , but that said , you have tanks in the street and right now there 's no organized alternative , '' he said . \n`` The question is , are there credible signs they -LRB- the military -RRB- are on a path that there 's no withdrawing from . '' \nTo help set that path , free and fair elections will be held in the next six to seven months , said Amre Moussa , Arab League secretary-general , who joined demonstrators in calling for Mubarak 's ouster , but said he has n't decided if he 'll run to succeed him . \nBefore those elections can be held , however , dramatic changes are needed as to who gets on the ballot , how political parties are formed and how Egyptians register to vote , said Joshua Muravchik , a fellow at the Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies , noting significant restrictions placed on the political process under Mubarak 's regime . \n`` This is all totally new for Egypt , '' he said . \nAnalysts agree that the future of Egypt could go in many different directions . \n`` When all the institutions are corrupt , who do you hand things off to ? '' \nByman asked , later adding that `` one very tricky point is that the Egyptian people have been unified on one thing : Mubarak must go . \nBut are they unified as to what Egypt will look like in the coming years ? \nYou need some unity and some vision . '' \nThere are a wealth of problems in Egypt and democracy is not a silver bullet that will cure them all . \n-- Joshua Muravchik , Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies Other question marks that remain are the future of Suleiman , a senior State Department official said Friday , and the role the Muslim Brotherhood may play in the new Egyptian government . \nThe Brotherhood is the largest and most organized opposition group in Egypt and has a religious and political agenda . \nSome fear that the organization could hijack the pro-democracy movement . \nA spokesman for the Muslim Brotherhood told CNN 's John King that his group trusts Egypt 's new military leadership to transition to a free and open democracy . \nEssam El-Erian said his organization , which has vowed not to field a presidential candidate , expects to be represented in a new parliament , but does not expect to win a majority of seats . \nAnother big obstacle will be reforming the country 's constitution in Mubarak 's wake . \nMubarak 's imposition of military rule Friday broke with the country 's 1971 constitution . \nThe constitution allows for only two scenarios for a president to relinquish power . \nThe first stipulates that if the president has to step aside temporarily , the vice president steps into the top role . \nThat is what the regime briefly orchestrated Thursday . \nThe constitution states further that , if the office of the president is vacated or the president becomes permanently disabled , the parliamentary speaker is to assume the role until new elections can be held . \nThose elections , in turn , must occur within 60 days . \nIn opting for a third way , which put all power in the hands of the military , the regime in effect rendered the constitution inoperable . \nMoussa said Friday that Egypt needs to have a `` modern constitution '' -- one that promises tolerance in light of what he called a `` renewed , positive relationship -LRB- across -RRB- all sections of Egyptian society . '' \nHowever , Pollack and others noted Friday , pillars of the Mubarak regime still remain in place , including the military forces serving as interim caretakers and the legislative parliament . \nHowever , a high-ranking Egyptian military official said that discussions were under way in the military Supreme Council about dismissing Mubarak 's government and parliament and the timing for elections . \nVicenzino said the military commission needs to begin a process of inclusiveness by reaching out to members of civil society to participate in the new political process . \nThe private sector , big industry , labor unions who represent millions of workers , must all be included in discussions going forward , Vicenzino said . \nStill , Johns Hopkins ' Muravchik cautioned that `` one election does not make a democracy . '' \n`` There are a wealth of problems in Egypt and democracy is not a silver bullet that will cure them all . '' \nAnd though the bubble of three weeks of tension burst Friday , the pressure could begin anew Saturday as some protesters said they would keep up the demonstration with more demands , including putting Mubarak on trial . \nCNN 's Laurie Ure , Elise Labott and Arwa Damon contributed to this report . \n"}
{"id": "78", "time": "2011-02-11", "text": "ANDERSON COOPER , CNN ANCHOR : Good evening , everyone . \nTo those watching in Egypt at this hour , sabah al khair . \nPeace be with you . \nLast week , as thugs descended on peaceful protesters in Liberation Square , we heard those protesters tell us that they were no longer afraid . \nTired of the indignities they had suffered at the hands of Mubarak for some 30 years , at the hands of his police and his thugs , they had defeated fear , they told us , the fear of Mubarak , the fear of those police , the fear of the repression and the torture and the torments . \nThey had defeated fear and there was no turning back . \nIt was just a hope 18 days ago , a hope that fear could be defeated . \nBut as the protests grew and the regime began to buckle , it became a belief and then a conviction . \nAnd , tonight , this night , this glorious morning in Cairo and throughout Egypt , it is fact . \nFear has been defeated in Egypt . \nAnd whatever happens next , good or bad , there is no turning back . \nThis is what liberation looks like . \nThis is what joy , long suppressed , long imprisoned , long tortured and tormented , this is what joy looks like and sounds like . \nTonight , Saturday morning in Egypt , the revolution has won . \nThe dictator , Mubarak , is gone . \nBut the new day dawning is not yet a democracy . \nThese people may have liberated Egypt , but the military now runs it . \nThey have always had a tight grip on the economy and a long history of wielding power . \nThis is the man believed to be in charge , Mohamed Hussein Tantawi , defense minister under Mubarak , now head of the military council running Egypt . \nThe council now ruling by decree , but promising to carry out constitutional reforms and respond to demonstrators ' demands . \nWe will talk in depth tonight about what happens next . \nBut , before we do , I just want to show you some of those remarkable moments today , as 80 million people in the world 's largest Arab country made history . \nLast night , at the s time , the dictator Mubarak and his henchman , Vice President Suleiman and dug in , patronizing protesters , unleashing their anger . \nWe can only assume the military finally had enough . \nJust after 6:00 local time , after a day of protests , right in the middle of evening prayers , the bulletin came on from state television . \nThe same network the day before had carried Mubarak defiantly refusing to step down . \nOMAR SULEIMAN , EGYPTIAN VICE PRESIDENT -LRB- through translator -RRB- : I have an important message from the presidency . \nIn the name of God , the most gracious , the most merciful , dear citizens , these are difficult times which our country has sustained . \nPresident Hosni Mubarak has decided to give up and commission the High Council of the Armed Forces to take over . \nCOOPER : The statement from Vice President Suleiman sudden and brief , but that is how the world changes . \nIt cost blood and it cost lives and it cost countless sacrifices . \nBut in the end , the regime fell with the blink of an eye . \nHere 's what it looked like just seconds later , people hugging , chanting : Egypt is free . \nYou 're an Egyptian . \nLift up your head . \nAnd they did , rich and poor , young and old . \nTo the young Google executive who took a leave of absence to help organize the revolution , this was an especially sweet moment . \nWael Ghonim , that 's him in his home when the news struck . \nHe now says Egypt will be a fully democratic state . \nThat is his hope . \nThe world , he says , will be impressed . \nThat is his belief . \nHe says he will not take part in any government , but that his work is done and in any case he 's no hero . \nWAEL GHONIM , GOOGLE EXECUTIVE : The real heroes are the ones in the streets . \nThe real heroes today are every single Egyptian . \nThere is no one leading this . \nAnyone who is telling you he is one of the leaders is not saying the truth . \nThe leaders , you know , on Tahrir Square was every single person there . \nThe leader in Alexandria is every single person there . \nCOOPER : Wael Ghonim today about an hour into Egypt 's new era . \nWe have a full interview with him in the hour ahead . \nA short time later , President Obama poured praise on the Egyptian people . \nBARACK OBAMA , PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES : This is the power of human dignity , and it could never be denied . \nEgyptians have inspired us , and they have done so by putting the lie to the idea that justice is best gained through violence . \nFor an Egypt , it was the moral force of non-violence -- not terrorism , not mindless killing -- but non-violence , moral force that bent the arc of history toward justice once more . \nCOOPER : The arc of history bent toward history once more . \nVice President Biden today calling on Iran 's government to follow Egypt 's example -- 32 years ago today , on this day , the shah 's regime collapsed , also in a popular uprising . \nTheocracy , though , followed though , not freedom . \nSome have similar concerns about Egyptian and the Muslim Brotherhood . \nOthers worry about the military breaking its promises . \nWael Ghonim says he understands those fears , but he puts his faith in 80 million Egyptians . \nAnd that sentiment is on the lips of many of those Egyptians tonight . \nFear has been defeated , they 're crying , and there is no turning back . \nJoining us once again , Ben Wedeman in Cairo and Ivan Watson in Cairo . \nAnd here with me , Professor Dr. Fouad Ajami of the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies and the Hoover Institution . \nFOUAD AJAMI , PROFESSOR OF MIDDLE EASTERN STUDIES , JOHNS HOPKINS SCHOOL OF ADVANCED INTERNATIONAL STUDIES : Well , what can I tell you ? \nI come from a generation whose heart was broken by Egypt . \nWe witnessed the defeat of Egypt , those of us Arabs born in the -- who came to politics in the '50s and the '60s . \nWe witnessed the defeat of Egyptian state in the Six Day War of 1967 , the collapse of the dream of Nasserism and the weakness of Egypt as a country . \nAnd here we are , we now have the glory of Egypt , that Egypt has given the Arabs the way forward , civilian politics , but resistance to the ruler and belief in democracy . \nCOOPER : And that 's why we hear Egyptians and especially children chanting , hold your head up high . \nThis was the chant of Gamal Abdel Nasser , by the way , in the '50s and the '60s , when they still loved him , which is asking Egyptians , who have been much trampled upon by the world , badly treated by the world , badly treated by colonial powers from the world over , and the Egyptians finally reached their dignity . \nThe tragedy of Hosni Mubarak was that here is a man who in fact took the dreams of Egypt and crushed them completely . \nHe crushed all independent people in the country , and he insisted on his own primacy over the country . \nAnd they were done with him . \nCOOPER : Ben , at this point , do we know exactly what happened ? \nBecause this hour last night Mubarak had go on state television and dug in , treating the protesters almost like children . \nSuleiman had also gone on state television . \nAnd then all of a sudden , hours later , he 's -- they 're announcing that he 's gone . \nDid the -- was this a coup ? \nDid the military just say to him , you have to go ? \nBEN WEDEMAN , CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : Well , we do n't really have the exact details , Anderson . \nBut I think it was a combination of factors . \nFor one , I think President Mubarak and the people around him miscalculated the reaction of Egyptians to his speech last night . \nThey did not realize that this simply was not enough for the people here in Tahrir Square and across the country . \nThey wanted him to go . \nIt was an equivocal demand , and they simply perhaps did not understand it . \nAnother important factor to keep in mind is that the labor movement over the last three days was becoming increasingly involved in the revolution , and that -- if you look at other revolutions , the overthrow of Nimeiri in the Sudan , and Ben Ali in Tunisia , it was the involvement of the trade unions later in the game that really brought down the regime . \nNow , I want to share one bit of sort of a symbol of how things have changed . \nThis is `` Al-Ahram , '' the state newspaper , and until recently , it was very much the mouthpiece of the regime . \nIts headline today , `` The People Have Toppled the Regime . '' \nThis is incredibly significant when you think that just a few days ago , it was President Mubarak on the cover almost every day . \nThis was the newspaper of the regime , and now the regime is gone . \nAnd this newspaper is selling like hotcakes -- Anderson . \nCOOPER : Save me a copy , if you can . \nBen , the -- I also understand on state television that President Obama ... COOPER : ... that President Obama 's speech was carried live on state television and that people have been calling into state television . \nThey have actually had kind of call-ins where people have been critical sort of everything , of corruption of the regime , of the state television , and that the anchors have been apologizing . \nWEDEMAN : Well , this was an interesting day , because we had this huge demonstration outside of state TV . \nAnd state TV was running a banner that only five of their anchors were there , because no one could leave or enter the building because of the demonstration . \nAnd , later -- by the afternoon , what happened was they started to take calls from demonstrators who were criticizing the state TV and its anchors , saying , look , you have been lying all these years . \nStop slandering the protest movement . \nAnd what you had was the anchors saying , we were caught in a trap , that we were under pressure , but now we 're going to tell the truth . \nAnd they started holding live interviews in front of the state TV building with the demonstrators . \nAnd when I saw that , I thought , there 's no way that this regime , the previous regime , I should stress , could go on when its mouthpiece started to talk basically the language of the protest movement , so a very dramatic change in the tone . \nAnd this was before , of course , the announcement that President Mubarak was stepping down -- Anderson . \nCOOPER : Ivan Watson , I hate to be the sober guy at the party who pulls you out of the fun to ask you serious questions . \nThat 's always the boring person at the party . \nBut I got to ask you , we now know that Swiss banks have frozen or asked -- the Swiss government has asked banks to freeze the accounts , any Mubarak-related accounts in Switzerland . \nThey say they do n't know how many there may be , but they have asked banks to look at it . \nAt this point , we believe Mubarak is in Sharm el-Sheikh . \nIs there any sense of what happens to him next , because some people have said they want to see him on trial . \nThere 's others who said they want to see the money returned that he 's taken . \nIVAN WATSON , CNN CORRESPONDENT : That 's been one of the demands that 's been growing over the course of the past two-and-a-half weeks , Anderson . \nAnd a big question is going to be , well , what are the demonstrators in Tahrir Square , for instance , going to ask for next ? \nAre they going to step down now ? \nAre they going to start tearing down the barricades and going home and tearing down the tents ? \nI was just walking around . \nNone of the barricades have really come down . \nThe tents are still there . \nThe security lines are still there , the young men patting you down . \nAnd I asked one of them , how much longer are you going to stay here ? \nHosni Mubarak has left . \nAnd this guy said one or two days . \nMy colleague Arwa Damon has been down there throughout the evening . \nAnd she said that there were two opposing viewpoints cropping up between different demonstrators , a larger group saying , OK , we did it , we won , it 's time to getting life back to normal , Wael Ghonim saying that as well on his Twitter account . \nAnother group saying , no , we have got to stay here . \nWe do n't trust what is coming next . \nWe have got to make sure that all the demands are met . \nAnd some of these people definitely want to see Hosni Mubarak and members of his inner circle tried for what they say are crimes . \nMany people accuse him of stealing from the nation here . \nCOOPER : Fouad , how dangerous is what comes next ? \nYou have this military rule . \nWe saw a member of the military on television today saluting , not just Mubarak , but the martyrs , the young people who have died in this revolution over the last 18 days . \nThere 's a lot of obviously popular support for the military right now . \nOver months , though , that can change . \nAJAMI : Well , look , all revolutions in the end have these -- all kinds of unforeseen consequences . \nThe Egyptians have now entered a new world . \nThey have shed the old world . \nThey will try to create this new country . \nThey will want some accounting of what happened . \nAnd for -- when you think of the legacy of Mubarak and what he did to this country , he can think about it in Sharm el-Sheikh or Germany or wherever he ends up . \nThe great Gamal Abdel Nasser , millions of people wept for him when he died in 1970 . \nI remember that funeral . \nIt was one of the great events in the modern Middle East . \nPeople committed suicide grieving for him , because they loved him so . \nAnd Sadat , he left behind the legacy of Camp David . \nHe was controversial in his country , but people loved him . \nHere is this man who looted his country , and he leaves this power vacuum . \nSo we return back to the military . \nIt turns out that the military is the only viable institution , because , in fact , Mubarak , he devoured the political life of the country . \nHe destroyed democratic institutions . \nCOOPER : He destroyed any real opposition . \nLike , we have a good friend , Saad Eddin Ibrahim , a great academic . \nHe just said a few words on television and he ended up being in prison for three , four years . \nThey have destroyed him physically and they wrecked his life professionally . \nYou have Ayman Nour , a great politician , a liberal politician . \nHe dares do -- he does something amazingly simple . \nHe runs against Mubarak . \nHe loses , and he still ends up in prison . \nCOOPER : He ran for president and was then imprisoned . \nCOOPER : And only got 7 percent of the vote , and yet still ended up in prison . \nAJAMI : Exactly , just for the temerity of having run against pharaoh . \nSo , you enter this world now in a power vacuum , because you have a man like Mohamed ElBaradei . \nHe lived in Europe for a good deal of his life . \nCOOPER : Right , 30 years he spent mostly overseas . \nAJAMI : So , you have this vacuum . \nAnd the Egyptian will have to figure out what kind of political future they want . \nCOOPER : Do you worry about a push too fast to elections ? \nI think -- I 'm not worried , to be honest with you , about anything . \nAJAMI : Because I think here 's where we were . \nWe were under an incredibly cruel man who had really pulverized the life of Egypt . \nSo I look forward to what Egypt itself will spawn by way of politics , by way of culture . \nAnd I think everything looks better than what this man had in store for them . \nCOOPER : See -- and I can of agree with you , because it feels like people have underestimated Egypt now for 18 days and underestimated these protesters all along the way , each step , wringing their hands , saying , wait a minute , this is bad , this is bad , this is bad , slow down , slow down , slow down . \nAnd yet Egyptians have something else in mind . \nAJAMI : And then there are these people who are second-guessing the Egyptians , and I think many in our own country , and this is a real moral embarrassment in this country , that many are second-guessing the Egyptians , or will they create decent politics , will they fall into a theocracy ? \nWill they break peace with Israel ? \nWill they do this ? \nWill they squander the kind of freedom and the kind of new order that they have gained ? \nWe must trust people with their own history . \nThis is really the lesson of Midan Tahrir , of Liberation Square . \nWe must leave it to them . \nEvery time we wrote them off , they surprised us . \nEvery time Mubarak thought that he scared them , they came out in larger numbers , as you saw with your own eyes . \nSo we must trust the willingness of the Egyptians and the ability of the Egyptians to keep their own world intact and to spawn a new and decent country for themselves and their children . \nCOOPER : We 're going to more with Fouad throughout this hour and Ben and Ivan and all our correspondents . \nA quick reminder , the live chat is up and running at AC360 . \nUp next , how the Obama administration handled the revolution and the serious challenges it faces ahead . \nAlso , Fouad mentioned a power vacuum . \nSo we will talk more about those concerns , mainly in America , that it 's going to be filled by radical Islam or by the military or involvement of Iran . \nWe will talk about that all ahead . \nIt 's very hard to understand what freedom means until you lose it and you try to find it . \nCOOPER : That 's one of the protesters or one of the people that we heard from in the square today . \nI think I misspoke today . \nI said that the military spokesman went on television and saluted Mubarak , as well as the martyrs , the young people who died in the revolution . \nI do n't think that 's accurate . \nI think he praised Mubarak verbally and I think he actually just paused to actually salute the martyrs . \nI just want to make sure we 're accurate in everything that we 're saying . \nTake a look at pictures , a scene that looks familiar , a scene of revolution , but this is not Egypt . \nThis is a video from 32 years ago today , the day of Iran 's revolution , an odd coincidence that Mubarak steps down on the same day that the Iranian government was overthrown in 1979 . \nWe can take at least one lesson from the pictures of celebration from 32 years ago , the lesson being the end of a dynasty is only the beginning of the story and there 's no way to know exactly how it 's going to play out , what forces and motivations will possibly replace a toppled regime . \nA lot of folks will say , well , look , Egypt is not Iran , very different . \nAnd we will talk about that in a moment . \nToday , President Obama acknowledged the significance of this day and the fact that the story is just starting to be written . \nOBAMA : There are very few moments in our lives where we have the privilege to witness history taking place . \nThis is one of those moments . \nThis is one of those times . \nThe people of Egypt have spoken , their voices have been heard , and Egypt will never be the same . \nBy stepping down , President Mubarak responded to the Egyptian people 's hunger for change . \nBut this is not the end of Egypt 's transition . \nIt 's a beginning . \nI 'm sure there will be difficult days ahead , and many questions remain unanswered . \nCOOPER : Let 's talk about the days ahead . \nJoining me now live from Washington , former CIA Director James Woolsey , at the State Department , foreign affairs correspondent Jill Dougherty , and in Washington John King , and of course back with us Professor Fouad Ajami of Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies , also a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution . \nMr. Woolsey , how -- what is your biggest concern in terms of the months ahead ? \nI 'm guessing it 's an Islamist takeover or something to do with the military . \nWhat 's your biggest concern and how does -- how do the Egyptian people avoid it ? \nJAMES WOOLSEY , FORMER CIA DIRECTOR : Well , one very much hopes that the excellent and disciplined behavior and peaceful approach that the Egyptians have shown in these two-and-a-half weeks continues . \nBut there 's a whole history of revolutions , the French , the Russian , the Iranian of ' 78 - ' 79 , in which it looks like the good guys are going to win , and they do at first , and then months later , in the tumult of the revolution , Bolsheviks kill the Mensheviks , the Khomeini supporters kill the liberals in Iran and so on . \nThis has happened a number of times . \nAnd I think what we have to do is do everything we can , while staying very much in the background , to perhaps help bring about some economic investment in Egypt , to help any way that we or other countries can , so that they can build an infrastructure for democracy at the same time they 're probably relatively rapidly going to hold elections . \nIt 's -- but this story is n't over yet . \nI hope it all continues this way . \nBut the history of revolutions sometimes goes much worse than that . \nCOOPER : Fouad , is an Iran-style theocracy possible ? \nAJAMI : Well , look , revolutions can -- can be hijacked . \nThey can be betrayed . \nAnd , as Jim rightly said , the -- the zealots can take them over . \nThe Iranian Revolution had two revolutions within it . \nIt had a liberal revolution which was defeated and a theocratic revolution , which won out . \nSo , there is -- all kinds of possibilities lie in store for the Egyptians . \nAgain , we have to look at Egypt . \nAnd , in 2011 , it 's not Iran in 1979 . \nAnd the conditions are very different . \nAnd , however , we can not just say , well , all right , that the liberal course for Egypt will hold . \nThis is a very poor country , which is not really -- kind of that 's not the fertile soil for democratic , liberal politics , when 40 percent of your population lives below the poverty line , another one of the gifts of Hosni Mubarak to his people . \nSo , you were right . \nWe have to be vigilant . \nAnd the Egyptians themselves , they have to guard these gains that they have secured in Liberation Square . \nCOOPER : Jill , what are communications like , do we know , between the U.S. and the Egyptian government ? \nIt 's been a real problem obviously for the past few days . \nMy understanding from the reporting of you and John and others in Washington is that the White House frankly did n't even have any advanced warning that Mubarak was going to be stepping down . \nDo we know now what the communications are like between the military that 's ruling and the White House and the State Department ? \nJILL DOUGHERTY , CNN FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT : Well , that 's one thing they 're looking at , Anderson , because right now they are telling us that they 're trying to figure out exactly how this military council will work , who exactly is in charge of it . \nYou know , sometimes , the leader of a group like that may not emerge for a while . \nHow do they talk to them , at what level ? \nThe bureaucracy here has to talk to the bureaucracy there . \nThey have to get a bead on what their policy is . \nThere are many , many questions . \nAnd they 're looking at that right now . \nIt 's not very clear at all . \nCOOPER : John , what are you hearing , what have you learned about what has transpired in terms of the White House and the government in the last 24 hours vis-a-vis Egypt ? \nJOHN KING , HOST , `` JOHN KING , USA '' : Well , we know of course there have been mixed signals . \nWe know yesterday morning , when the president said we are witnessing history , they thought and they had been told by senior Egyptian officials that Mubarak was going to leave yesterday . \nThey are quite happy he left today . \nTo Jill 's point , this is a fascinating moment , because , normally , it is the president and then his secretary of state who are the faces , the voices of American foreign policy . \nDuring this crisis , the most important voices were the secretary of defense , Robert Gates , and the Admiral Mike Mullen , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , who have personal relationships going back some 20 years with Field Marshal Tantawi and other senior Egyptian military officials . \nAnd Secretary Gates alone spoke to the Field Marshal Tantawi at least five times that we know of . \nThey wo n't tell us much about those conversations . \nBut , Anderson , going forward , those relationships are critical . \nSome of them date back to the first Persian Gulf War . \nI actually spent some time with then General Tantawi 's troops in the Saudi desert back in that war 20 years ago , before the ground war started into Kuwait to push Saddam Hussein out . \nAnd those relationships are critical . \nAnd yet Secretary Gates and Admiral Mullen are both due to leave the administration in the months ahead . \nSo , it 's interesting to watch diplomacy being run out of the Pentagon . \nCOOPER : Well , a lot of the officer corps in the Egyptian military , it 's my understanding , has actually been educated in the United States in military colleges and military schools . \nBen , how much is known about this guy Tantawi ? \nWEDEMAN : Well , we know that he 's really from the same generation of former President Hosni Mubarak . \nHe 's in his mid-70s . \nHe was trained -- he 's received training in the Soviet Union . \nHe seemed to be very much an establishment man , a cautious man , in dealing with the military . \nUnder Mubarak , the military was very pampered . \nThey were well-equipped , well-paid . \nBut the price was that they tried -- they stay away from politics . \nNow , the chief of staff , Sami Anan , is a different sort of man . \nHe was trained in the United States . \nHe 's a generation younger than Mubarak . \nHe 's somebody who has had much more easy and constant contact with the United States military . \nSo , it 's a mixed bag . \nNow , we do n't know an awful lot about the other members of this higher military council . \nOf course , nobody was really aware that such a council even existed until this crisis came . \nWell , sorry about that , a little unruliness here in Tahrir -- not surprising . \nCOOPER : Not surprising and probably welcome , after some of the unruliness we have seen . \nJim , at this point , it 's important to remember the Interior Ministry is a massive organization in Egypt . \nProfessor Ajami has said there are estimates of it having more than 1.5 million employees , intelligence agents , secret agents , informers and the like . \nThey -- that apparatus is still all there . \nWhat happens to it ? \nDo we know much about how it will work with the military ? \nWOOLSEY : I do n't think we do . \nAt least I do n't . \nI think that it 's obviously got to be scaled way down and back and controlled . \nI think that the only thing we have really got going for us and the Egyptian people do here really is the coherence between the Egyptian military and the population . \nYou saw those wonderful films of the Egyptian soldiers hugging some of the children and the demonstrator groups and giving people tea and so forth . \nA lot rides here on the military keeping things stable and working with whoever helps manage things anew in Egypt to scale back and down and control some of those outfits like the Interior Ministry people . \nCOOPER : Jill Dougherty , James Woolsey , John King , thank you . \nBen Wedeman , Fouad Ajami , please stick with us . \nComing up , two of the most compelling voices in Egypt 's revolution talked to us on this remarkable day , one a Google executive on leave , one of the stars of -- also , one of the others , a star of a critically acclaimed movie , both Egyptian . \nFirst , Wael Ghonim , a hero of the revolution . \nHere he is celebrating today in his family 's home when he heard the news . \nHis job , his family , his very life on the line , he emerged as a leader , a reluctant leader . \nHe was detained for more than 10 days , said he was ready to die for the cause . \nI talked to him just after the news came in that Mubarak had resigned -- that interview in a moment . \nAlso , we will talk to actor-turned-activist Khalid Abdalla , star of `` The Kite Runner . '' \nWe have been checking in with him all week . \nHe 's been setting the scene for us . \nTonight , you will hear from him how much that scene has changed . \nCOOPER : Welcome back . \nThose are the words today from a central figure in the Egyptian uprising . \nWael Ghonim is a Google executive on leave from his job , turned activist . \nSome people say the roots of the uprising can be traced back to what he was posting on Facebook . \nHe said , `` Welcome back Egypt '' today . \nA Facebook spokesman today called Ghonim a hero . \nToday , we can also call him a revolutionary . \nHe had a lot to lose : a family , a great job . \nHe was detained by security forces for ten days , remained blindfolded . \nNo one told him what was going on , whether he would live or die . \nJust a few days ago , he said he was ready to die for the cause . \nI spoke to Ghonim earlier today shortly after we all learned the Mubarak stepped down . \nCOOPER : Wael , your thoughts on this extraordinary moment ? \nWAEL GHONIM , GOOGLE EXECUTIVE\\/EGYPTIAN ACTIVIST -LRB- via phone -RRB- : I 'm proud to be Egyptian . \nI just want to say , you know , from the bottom of my heart congratulations to all Egyptians . \nAnd you know , I want to say welcome back , Egypt . \nI just want to say to Hosni Mubarak and to Omar Suleiman and to all those people who thought that -- that being in power means you can oppress people , you are responsible of the killing of 300 innocent Egyptians . \nYou guys are still going to pay the price . \nIt 's enough -- it 's enough for you guys that in the history books they 're going to -- they 're going to say one word to describe you , a dictator . \nToday , I am telling you Egypt is going to be a democratic state . \nEgypt is going to start all over , and you will be impressed how fast we will be developing . \nCOOPER : Did you believe this day would come when you set up that first Web site , when you were in detention , being blindfolded and held ? \nGHONIM : Personally I believed . \nBecause at the end of the day , you know -- at the moment you break the psychological barrier of fear , the moment you break the fear , the moment you convince people that , if they die , it 's better to die for a good cause than to live without dignity , which is something that we all worked on in our message at the very beginning . \nThen -- then you should be sure that you are going to win . \nCOOPER : And your thoughts at this moment almost must turn to all those who have lost their lives just in the last two weeks . \nCOOPER : So much blood has been spilled . \nGHONIM : Those people are the real heroes . \nThose people are the real heroes . \nYou know , like , there are lots of people that we know that have died . \nAnd also I would n't forget those who were arrested . \nThere are about a thousand people that , you know , no one knows where are they right now . \nWe are looking for them . \nWe want them back . \nI was not the leader , by the way . \nI was -- it just happened that I got all the attention that I do n't deserve . \nI 'm not downplaying my role ; this is the truth . \nThe real people you should be hosting on your show , it 's not me ; it 's actually the people in Tahrir Square , who slept in -LRB- UNINTELLIGIBLE -RRB- , who saw their friends and family dying beside them . \nThose are the real heroes . \nBLITZER : Wael , this is Wolf Blitzer in Washington . \nSo first Tunisia , now Egypt . \nYou 're giving Facebook a lot of credit for this ? \nGHONIM : Yes , for sure . \nI want to meet Mark Zuckerberg one day and thank him , actually . \nThis revolution started online . \nThis revolution started on Facebook . \nYou know , I always said that if you want to liberate a society , just give them the Internet . \nIf you want to have a free society , give them the Internet . \nI want to say a final word . \nThanks to you and you folks on Tahrir Square . \nYou guys have played a great role in saving the lives of hundreds , if not thousands of people . \nThis regime did not care about the people , and they would have killed a lot of people if there was no international media . \nCNN did a great job . \nYou guys deserve a great -- a great -- a commission from the Egyptian people . \nWe 're not going to forget your role . \nCOOPER : Wael , we just got a thing crossing the latest wire , saying that Egypt 's supreme military council will sack the cabinet , suspend both houses of parliament and govern with the head of the supreme court . \nYour reaction to that ? \nThey 're just -- here 's what I thought of in the military . \nThese guys do n't want to be in power . \nThese guys want Egypt to come back . \nAs we told you , even if I do n't trust anyone , I trust the Egyptians . \nThis is the time where history is being rewritten now . \nWe are dreamers , and we made it happen . \nAnd it 's time now to celebrate for a couple of days . \nAnd then -- and then go back and start thinking about how can we develop this country and what 's the best way ? \nCOOPER : It 's incredible when you think eight days ago , government thugs and mobs were hunting for reporters , looking at live shot locations , hunting literally for cameras to pull them off of balconies so that no one would see , so the world would not witness the attacks that were taking place in Liberation Square . \nI remember getting lit up with lasers -- with laser sights while doing live shots . \nAnother enduring voice of this revolution has been that of Khalid Abdullah . \nHe 's an actor turned activists . \nHe starred in `` The Kite Runner , '' traded the movie star life for a place in Liberation Square . \nThroughout the uprising , he 's given us his perspective every night on this program . \nJust last night he spoke in a tired voice about the Arab disappointment among the protestors . \nHe was sleeping in the square last night . \nToday , a new day in every sense of the word . \nI spoke to Khalid a few moments ago . \nCOOPER : Khalid , where were you the moment you heard the news ? \nKHALID ABDULLAH , ACTOR : I stepped out to a friend 's flat , because I had to record a message for a demonstration that was supposed to take place tomorrow in -LRB- UNINTELLIGIBLE -RRB- Square . \nWe were just downloading the footage . \nAnd in the middle of doing so , the footage turned out to be entirely irrelevant , because Omar Suleiman came on TV and gave all 12 seconds of his speech . \nAnd then suddenly , we ran out to the balcony , and then I just grabbed my stuff , ran down into the street . \nAnd then I just ran into the middle of the square . \nPeople were shouting and screaming and crying , saying that they were going to take their country into their own hands , that they were going to build it . \nPeople feel enabled ; people feel empowered . \nPeople feel like the -- you know , the country 's future is in their hands . \nIt 's a feeling that they 've never had before . \nAnd I think one of the most beautiful things I saw , because I -- you know , I took a long walk around , and I walked up to Asanir -LRB- ph -RRB- Bridge , which is where I came originally into Tahrir Square , which was a very cleansing feeling . \nBut the most beautiful -- the most beautiful sight was the sight of children chanting that they should -- you know , hold your head high , you 're an Egyptian . \nCOOPER : So many people around the world have watched this and , I think , underestimated you and the other protestors from the beginning , said , `` Oh , they 're too young . \nThey do n't know what they 're doing . \nThey 're too idealistic . '' \nAnd then they said , `` Well , they can never stand up to the government , '' and the protestors did that . \nAnd then they said the full demands will never be met , and the full demands were met . \nAnd now they 're saying , well , what happens now ? \nYou know , will this revolution be overtaken by a group like the Muslim Brotherhood or by the military ? \nDo you have faith that the Egyptian people have somehow found a voice and will not lose that voice ? \nABDULLAH : I know for sure . \nAnd also -- I mean , something to say about the Muslim Brotherhood is I think they have fundamentally changed over the , you know , over the last few weeks . \nThere they were , you know -- they 've been living in a -- they 've been living in the square , you know , in and amongst people from all walks of life . \nThe tent I was in , you know , directly -- directly next door to me were a whole group of Muslim Brotherhood , and I had a long conversation with them yesterday . \nAnd you know , I think the way that they think has changed . \nBut I mean , regardless of all that , I do n't think there 's any possibility of them coming to power . \nAnd as regards the military , I think the military knows that it 's in the service of the people . \nCOOPER : What do you see in the months ahead ? \nDo you see -- I talked to Mohammed ElBaradei earlier today . \nHe said , `` Look , we need a year . \nEgypt needs a year in order to develop democratic institutions , in order to develop parties , in order for people to grow and support different parties , and for free and fair elections to actually take place . '' \nDo you see a birth now of parties ? \nDo you see the birth of democratic institutions happening ? \nABDULLAH : In terms of political parties , I think now there 's going to be a flourishing of voices . \nPeople want to participate . \nAnd that 's an extraordinary thing . \nI mean -- and not just people who were here . \nI mean , not just Egyptians who were here . \nEgyptians who were abroad . \nWhat has happened here , you have to understand this , that under Hosni Mubarak there was no space for political participation . \nThere was no space for feeling like you were part of this country 's future . \nCOOPER : Khalid Abdullah , appreciate your time . \nThank you , Khalid . \nABDULLAH : Thank you so much . \nAnd I just need -- I just need to say to you again -- I just need to say it to you again : it has really meant so much , your coverage , to all of us here . \nSo thank you very much for everything you 've done . \nCOOPER : Thank you . \nIt 's an honor to be reporting on your efforts . \nEgyptians still celebrating , nearly 12 hours after the announcement Mubarak is stepping down . \nSome insights , some of the best sights and sounds , the most remarkable moments from all over the country that we 've heard in the last 12 hours . \nAnd we 'll some final thoughts from Dr. Fouad Ajami and Ben Wedeman and Ivan Watson and others on the ground . \nCOOPER : Well , today , revolution is what we witnessed : a long - ruling dictator driven from power and a long-oppressed people celebrating still in the streets , in that square , waving their country 's flags , honking horns , tasting freedom for the first time . \nThe Egyptian people are demanding democracy . \nWhether they get it , they are demanding it . \nRight now , today , old Egypt is dead . \nA new Egypt is born . \nOMAR SULEIMAN , VICE PRESIDENT OF EGYPT -LRB- through translator -RRB- : President Mohamed Hosni Mubarak has decided to step down as president of Egypt and has assigned the higher council of the armed forces to run the affairs of the country . \nHosni Mubarak is stepping down . \nGHONIM -LRB- via phone -RRB- : I 'm proud to be Egyptian . \nI just want to say from the bottom of my heart congratulations to all Egyptians , and I want to say welcome back , Egypt . \nMOHAMED ELBARADEI , OPPOSITION LEADER -LRB- via phone -RRB- : It 's a sense of liberation for me , for every Egyptian . \nA sense of emancipation of the whole Egyptian people . \nAnd for the first time , Egypt has a chance to be democratic , to be free . \nEgyptians have a sense of dignity , of freedom . \nSo it 's amazing . \nIt 's like 180 degrees . \nIt 's something we never experienced in our lifetime . \nBARACK OBAMA , PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATS : One Egyptian put it simply : most people have discovered in the last few days that they are worth something . \nAnd this can not be taken away from them any more . \nNIC ROBERTSON , CNN CORRESPONDENT : There 's a feeling of euphoria down here . \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : I 'm so excited . \nI can actually hardly hear what you 're saying , so I 'm just going to give them a chance to talk . \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : I am very happy now . \nAlways the people of Egypt are very happy because Mubarak is going . \nAnd we will rebuild Egypt . \nI repeat , we will rebuild Egypt . \nAnd I think we deserve this , as we make this . \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : I think it 's the best day ever . \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : Today is an overwhelming day for Egypt . \nEveryone is finally free . \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : We had a chance to taste freedom . \nCOOPER : Egyptians riding the wave of history today , harnessing that wave , and the wave washed us all today . \nIncredible day in history . \nLet 's get some final thoughts . \nIvan Watson is in Cairo , Ben Wedeman , as well . \nHere in New York , Professor Fouad Ajami . \nBen , your thoughts ? \nIt 's hard to process , probably but do you have a final thought for us tonight ? \nWEDEMAN : My thought is 18 days -- 18 days from the first what seemed like a modest demonstration , which grew very big to what we saw today . \nHuge demonstrations in Tahrir Square . \nHuge demonstrations outside the president 's palace . \nHuge demonstrations outside of state TV . \nWe really saw the ability of the Egyptian people . \nAnd the power of people to bring down a regime that so many people thought was permanent , could n't be shaken . \nIt 's been a life changing experience to see this happen in so short a period of time . \n18 days -- Anderson . \nCOOPER : Ben and your photographer Mary Rogers have covered it unlike anyone else . \nWill continue , no doubt . \nIvan Watson , a thought from you ? \nWATSON : I 've been covering this region in the Middle East . \nIt 's sadly all too often a blood-soaked region of conflict and extremism . \nAnd I just feel honored to have been able to witness up close a bright and shining very pure moment of history here where Arabs , Egyptians got up and taught me that they could do something just really , really beautiful and peaceful and make change and believe in it . \nAnd -- and it brings out an idealist in you in a world of cynicism . \nIt was really incredible . \nAnd this revolution was growing until the moment that we heard President Mubarak was -- ex-President Mubarak was stepping down . \nWe were watching the crowds coming up by foot from Tahrir Square six miles away to the presidential palace and the people who were already there embracing them . \nWhen that news hit , it was an explosion of joy and I saw two men drop to their knees and start praying right away . \nIt 's an amazing couple of weeks . \nCOOPER : Ivan , you and your photographer , Joe Durand -LRB- ph -RRB- and Tommy Evans and all the team from CNN on the ground and all the reporters , you 've risked your lives in the last two weeks , and we thank you for your reporting . \nFOUAD AJAMI , JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY : I echo these gifts -LRB- ph -RRB- that reporters have done the story heroically , I think . \nYou know , the Caireans , the people of Cairo , love their city , and they have this great label for it . \nThey call it `` Umya dinya '' -LRB- ph -RRB- , the mother of the world . \nThis is a city that was established a millennium ago , and it has fallen on hard times and they wish to rebuild it . \nThey wish to reclaim it . \nAnd the Egyptians have a memory . \nIt helps them that they have a memory . \nA good period in their history . \nThe inter-war years in Egypt were years of a vibrant democracy : women 's emancipation . \nGreat filmmakers , great artists , great novelists , genuine parliamentary competition . \nSo it 's not like they have to do something that they 've never done before . \nThey just have to find their bearing and they have to erase the legacy of this despotism , and they will find their way . \nCOOPER : Fouad , I appreciate you being with us in many of these 18 days . \nSome important news after the break . \nWe 'll be right back . \nCOOPER : Before we end , a quick check of the other day 's stories . \nJoe Johns has a `` 360 Bulletin '' -- Joe . \nJOE JOHNS , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Anderson , today was the last day in the briefing room for White House press secretary Robert Gibbs . \nPresident Obama bid him farewell by returning a tie to Gibbs , now framed , that Mr. Obama borrowed from him to give the keynote address at the Democratic National Convention in 2004 . \nGibbs will become an outside advisor to the president . \nAn unusual light show in eastern Ohio . \nA gas pipeline exploded last night , shooting flames 200 feet into the air , which could be seen for miles . \nThe explosion happened in a rural area . \nNo one was injured . \nAnd the condition of this humpback whale is likely due to scoliosis or curvature of the spine and not the result of a collision with a ship . \nThat 's what a marine expert told a newspaper . \nA pilot spotted the whale off Hawaii 's coast this week and assumed the whale was injured by a ship . \nJoe , thank you very much . \nWe 're going to continue to follow the story of Egypt in the days and the weeks and the months ahead . \nWant to thank you for sticking with us throughout this coverage . \nOur story of Egypt continues and so will our coverage . \nBack to Cairo at the top of the hour . \nMore history being made . \n"}
{"id": "150", "time": "2011-02-11", "text": "By the CNN Wire Staff The moment Egypt was free from Mubarak NEW : Moussa says it could take 7 months before state-of-emergency laws can be lifted U.S. has invested billions `` propping up that dictator , '' Rep. Ron Paul says of Mubarak Obama says the `` transition must bring all of Egypt 's voices to the table '' Cairo , Egypt -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak stepped down Friday and handed over power to the military , his nearly three decades of iron rule ended by a groundswell of popular protests that began January 25 . \nIn a somber , one-minute announcement on state television , Vice President Omar Suleiman announced Mubarak 's resignation and said the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces will `` run the affairs of the country . '' \nAs Suleiman spoke , deafening cheers erupted among tens of thousands of Egyptians who thronged the streets of Cairo . \nIt was a moment they had sought throughout long , often tense days of demonstrations -- some of them violent -- that demanded Mubarak 's departure . \nIt was a moment that many in the Arab world 's powerhouse nation had not dared contemplate . \nChants of `` Egypt is free ! '' \nand `` God is great ! '' \nrose from the crowds , dizzy in the honeymoon of their success . \nSome waved Egyptian flags ; others honked horns ; still others set off fireworks as they savored the scene . \nTwo major bridges over the Nile River resembled congested parking lots , and partiers packed streets throughout Cairo . \nThe state-run Middle East News Agency said some people had passed out from joy and others had suffered heart attacks . \n`` It was a sense of liberation for me , for every Egyptian , '' said opposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei . \n`` For the first time , Egypt has a chance to be democratic , to be free , to have a sense of dignity , of freedom . \nSo it 's amazing . \nIt 's just like something we never experienced in our lifetime . '' \nA source with close connections to Persian Gulf government leaders said Mubarak , 82 , had fled to the Red Sea resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh , his presidency finished as abruptly as it had started in 1981 , when he ascended to power after the assassination of Anwar Sadat . \nThe repercussions echoed far beyond Tahrir Square as the Swiss government moved Friday to freeze assets belonging to Mubarak and his family , said Norbert Baerlocher , a spokesman for the Swiss Embassy in Washington . \nObama : ` Egypt will never be the same ' Woolsey : Next step marks Egypt 's fate Ghonim : Facebook to thank for freedom In a speech to the nation Thursday night , Mubarak had indicated that he was delegating authority to Suleiman but made no mention of resigning . \nDisappointed crowds calling for his ouster grew in number Friday in Cairo and in other major cities . \nBy Friday night , the protesters got what they were seeking . \nBut amid the euphoria , ElBaradei sounded a note of caution . \n`` We have challenges ahead of us , '' said the Nobel laureate , who some believe could emerge as Egypt 's next leader . \n`` I think we need to not worry about retribution . \nMubarak needs to go , and we need to look forward . '' \nAmre Moussa , the Egyptian secretary-general of the Arab League , told CNN that the country should focus on instituting reforms and establishing democracy . \nAsked how long it would take for the government to lift the 30-year-old state-of-emergency laws , he said , `` The sooner the better ... six , seven months . '' \nAsked whether he will run for office , Moussa demurred . \n`` That is not an issue to discuss today , '' he said . \n`` The time for such a question will come . '' \nGallery : Protesters celebrate Mubarak 's resignation Wael Ghonim , the Egyptian activist who became a reluctant hero of the revolution but has made clear that he has no interest in becoming a political leader , predicted that history books would describe Mubarak as a dictator . \nGhonim -- a Google executive on leave from his job whose Facebook page is credited with triggering the uprising -- was seized by security forces and held for 10 days . \nHis powerful television interview after his release Monday galvanized the protesters in Tahrir Square . \nHe said he had felt certain that Mubarak would be forced out after a revolt in Tunisia forced that country 's leader to step down in January , and he said he believed the Egyptian military could be trusted to respect the demands of the protesters . \nMany protesters had been calling for Egypt 's army , which is respected within the country , to take over as interim caretaker . \nFriday night , they voiced optimism that the military would pave the way for free and fair elections . \nThroughout the uprising , the military both responded to the protesters and defended Mubarak 's regime . \nIt showed signs Thursday that it was assuming a greater role when the supreme council met without Mubarak , who was then still the supreme commander of the armed forces . \nFriday , it issued a communique stating that Egypt 's emergency laws , used by Mubarak throughout his tenure as president to rule with an iron hand , would be lifted , but only when conditions allowed . \nAfter Mubarak stepped down , a military spokesman appeared on state television , expressing appreciation to the former president and saluting the `` martyrs , '' an apparent reference to those who died in the protests . \nHuman Rights Watch has documented more than 300 deaths since the uprising began January 25 . \nMany of the pitched battles between security forces and Mubarak 's foes unfolded in the same places that were scenes of jubilation Friday night . \nBut Friday 's revelry could not push aside the looming uncertainty over what will come next in the Arab world 's most populous nation and how Egypt 's revolution , which succeeded on the 32nd anniversary of Iran 's , might affect the region . \nEvents in Egypt may extendfar beyond the country 's borders , Moussa said . \n`` Winds of change are sweeping the Arab world and the Middle East , '' he said . \nIn Washington , U.S. President Barack Obama said the people of this key U.S. ally have made it clear that `` nothing less than genuine democracy will carry the day . '' \nHe praised the Egyptian military for acting responsibly and said it now needs to help ensure a credible transition . \nAmong other things , Egyptian authorities need to set about `` protecting the rights of Egypt 's citizens , lifting the emergency law , revising the constitution and other laws to make this change irreversible , and laying out a clear path to elections that are fair and free , '' Obama said . \nBut two miles from the White House , at a meeting of the Conservative Political Action Conference , Rep. Ron Paul , R-Texas , said that the United States had invested billions of dollars over the years `` propping up that dictator '' and has little to show for it . \n`` Where do you think the money went ? \nTo a Swiss bank account , '' he said . \n`` It contributed to our debt , billions and billions of dollars , and all we get is chaos from it and instability . '' \nA spokesman for Obama 's predecessor said Friday that former President George W. Bush `` congratulates the people of Egypt for taking an important and impressive first step toward freedom . '' \nBut the U.S. government 's applause for Egypt 's step toward freedom and away from Mubarak differed markedly from its previous stance . \nAt a joint news conference with Mubarak in April 2004 at Bush 's ranch in Crawford , Texas , he offered support for his Egyptian counterpart . \n`` Egypt is a strategic partner of the United States , and we value President Mubarak 's years of effort on behalf of the peace and stability of the Middle East , '' Bush said . \n`` President Mubarak can be confident in my friendship and America 's partnership as he moves forward to realize the hopes of his people . '' \nJust where those hopes would lead was not clear in the heady hours after Mubarak 's resignation . \nWhat was clear was that Mubarak 's imposition of military rule broke with Egypt 's 1971 constitution . \nThe constitution allows for only two scenarios for a president to relinquish power . \nThe first stipulates that if the president has to step aside temporarily , the vice president steps into the top role . \nThat is what the regime briefly orchestrated Thursday . \nThe constitution states further that , if the office of the president is vacated or the president becomes permanently disabled , the parliamentary speaker is to assume the role until new elections can be held . \nThose elections , in turn , must occur within 60 days . \nIn opting for a third way , which put all power in the hands of the military , the regime in effect rendered the constitution inoperable . \nA high-ranking Egyptian military official said the army 's command was discussing whether to dismiss Mubarak 's government and parliament and when the next election would be held . \nBut some analysts were sounding the alarm over the takeover by the military , which has suddenly become accountable for the nation . \n`` Suleiman 's statement is the clearest indication thus far that the military has carried out a coup led by Defense Minister Field Marshal Mohammed Hussein Tantawi , '' analysts with Stratfor , a global intelligence company , said in a statement . \n`` Egypt is returning to the 1952 model of ruling the state via a council of army officers , '' the statement said . \n`` The question now is to what extent the military elite will share power with its civilian counterparts .

Uprising : ElBaradei : Army Must Share Power ; State Media Apologizing to People of Egypt for Spreading Lies ; Egyptian Citizen : ` We 've Had Our Chains Broken ' Aired February 11 , 2011 - 13:00 ET THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT . \nWOLF BLITZER , CNN ANCHOR : Let 's reset . \nIt 's the top of the hour right now . \nWe 're standing by , 30 minutes from now we 'll be hearing from the president of the United States . \nHe 'll be addressing the nation , indeed the world . \nMost specifically , he 'll be addressing the people of Egypt in a half an hour from the White House . \nWe 'll , of course , have live coverage of that . \nWe 're down in the square , Tahrir Square . \nWe 're all over Cairo . \nOutside of Cairo in Egypt there is massive celebration under way , right now . \nThe celebration , because within the past few hours , it 's become official . \nThe Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak is no longer the president of Egypt . \nHis vice president made the announcement on Egyptian television saying that the military , the Egyptian military , now , specifically , the high council of the Egyptian military , will supervise implementation on this road to democracy to free and fair elections , probably easier said than done . \nBut there 's celebration throughout Egypt right now because there 's high confidence and support for the Egyptian military . \nThe thought is if anyone can implement this transition away from dictatorship towards democracy , the military , which is highly respected , can do it . \nWe 'll see if that is doable . \nIn fact , we 're not only getting reaction from inside Egypt , you can see the flag waving , the celebratory events going on , but getting reaction from all of our correspondents from around the world . \nAnderson Cooper is joining us in our coverage today , so is Hala Gorani . \nGuys , a lot of us who watched Egypt over the years , have watched the Middle East over the years , ca n't really believe what 's going on . \nWithin 18 days , a dictator is removed . \nThere was some violence , but it could have been so much worse . \nThousands of people could have been killed . \nHuman rights watch says more than 300 were killed . \nThere still are plenty of people in prison , right now , but , at least , this is a step forward and both of you were there , Anderson . \nLet me go to you , right now , as we await to hear from the president of the United States . \nI want our viewers , here in the United States and around the world , on CNN International to get a flavor of this historic moment . \nANDERSON COOPER , CNN ANCHOR : I just got word that President Obama will no longer be speaking at 1:30 . \nWe do still expect him to speak , though it 's not clear at what time he will be speaking but that 1:30 time we 're told is no longer the time that he will be speaking . \nBut it is a remarkable turn of events . \nIn 18 days , one of the most powerful dictators , in the region , certainly , has left office . \nWe 're told he 's gone to Sharm el-Sheikh , although we have n't been able to confirm that . \nOur Ben Wedeman is standing by . \nBen , extraordinary is just the word I keep coming back to . \nSeeing the crowds , knowing -- seeing what we have seen over these last 18 days . \nDid you think this would come , when it began , when tear gas was flying and riot police were attacking these protesters , did you think that they had a chance to actually do this ? \nBEN WEDEMAN , CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : Anderson , I thought they had a chance , because , from the very beginning , the government overreacted to everything and what they got was equal and opposite reaction from the -- to prove that they were ready to carry this battle to the very end . \nWe saw them define a ban on the protests , we saw them incredibly organized , every time the police would crack down in one area , a crowd would show up in another . \nSo , from the very beginning , on the 25th of January , my sense was that this was not an ordinary day , that this -- these were not just the usual small protests easily suppressed by the police . \nThat this was a groundswell that really was not going to be stopped , and when -- on the 25th , when I was in Tahrir Square , and I saw the demonstrators pushing the police back near the parliament building , I realized that this was , potentially , the end of the Mubarak regime , simply because they were not ready to deal with this level of public defiance of a regime that has been in place for 30 years -- Anderson . \nANDERSON : I want to bring in , now , Hala Gorani who is watching this , as well -- Hala . \nHALA GORANI , CNN CORRESPONDENT : And , Arwa Damon is in the thick of it all , in the middle of it all , there , with those protesters celebrating . \nWe saw those tent cities a little bit earlier , Arwa , because there was a small core of activists determined to spend the night there , day in , day out digging in their heels until Hosni Mubarak stepped down . \nAnd there you have it , this sort of little village within a city within a state , and it 's the protesters in this square that ended up , through their actions and determination , forcing the resignation of Hosni Mubarak . \nArwa , you 're in the middle of it all . \nWhat are people telling you ? \nARWA DAMON , CNN CORRESPONDENT : I 'm sorry . \nCould you repeat that , please ? \nGORANI : What are people telling you , Arwa ? \nDAMON : Oh , you see this entire sea of people in front of me ? \nPeople from all walks of life , people happy , celebrating . \nThere was a live band on the stage , very , very happy I 'm being told , the Egyptian people are happy . \nThey have achieved -- they have achieved the unimaginable , and they can not believe -- I 'm just hearing from this young man that this dream has actually become a reality that they have freedom , and , now , I 'm going to put another young man on the phone to tell us exactly how are you feeling at this moment ? \nWe feel now we have -- Mubarak -- we will judge him now and - INAUDIBLE . \nDAMON : And there we have it , quite brief -LRB- ph -RRB- . \nIt 's quite chaotic here . \nMany people want to talk . \nEverybody reiterating the fact that they do love Egypt , and , yes , this is completely a victory . \nPeople having a lot of messages . \nThis young man also telling us that they removed INAUDIBLE Mubarak in three weeks and want the entire world to know this . \nEgyptians are the best . \nThey want that to get out to the rest of the world . \nYou have a message ? \nTell us what your message is . \nDAMON : And what happens next ? \nEverybody will go home and start working . \nThere will be a hope . \nBefore there was no hope , but from now on , they will see another hope , you will see another enthusiasment -LRB- ph -RRB- . \nYou will see that we want really new productivity in just a few years . \nDAMON : And just to add on to that idea , another man that I had met , a few nights ago , telling us that he learned a very valuable lesson from the youth that came together to start this demonstration . \nHe was saying that they INAUDIBLE finally be positive , that Mubarak 's regime had nothing but create ways negativity in this society . \nWith that , now , finally , they felt they can be positive . \nThere 's a doctor with me , right now , who , also , that wants to speak . \nI 'm assuming that you probably seen the worst of what happened after these devastations with the violence . \nYou had to treat many patients . \nWhat are your feelings right now ? \nCongratulations to all Egyptians but also Egyptians , we are -- our Egypt , our country , to get INAUDIBLE love , love freedom . \nDo a lot of sort of things to our country , we hope that the region will be good to this life . \nDAMON : A lot of hopes . \nA lot of opinions . \nA lot of enthusiasm , as you can , obviously , tell . \nPeople absolutely thrilled and very relieved , too . \nOne of the great concerns we had been hearing before was that all of the blood that had been shed here would going to be in vain if President Mubarak did not step down , but now the crowds , here , knowing and believing that everything that they 've had to sacrifice has been worth it . \nGORANI : All right , Arwa Damon , thanks very much , in Tahrir Square . \nAs much as we want to talk about the future , it seems people in Tahrir and around Cairo and the rest of Egypt , just want to , kind of , enjoy the moment -- Anderson ? \nANDERSON : Understandably so . \nIvan Watson is by the presidential palace . \nIvan , what are people , there , saying ? \nIvan Watson , if you can hear me at the presidential palace , what is -- what are people saying there ? \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : What do you want to do with Arwa ? \nANDERSON : Clearly we 're having trouble getting in touch with Ivan . \nWe have correspondents really -- the presidential palace is quite a distance away from Liberation Square , and , for many days , the protesters had talked about marching on the presidential palace , but there were about , at least , six checkpoints , according to our Ben Wedeman , military checkpoints between Liberation Square and the palace . \nSo , the idea of a large crowd actually marching and being able to get there , seemed unlikely . \nAnd every day , though there was talk about doing it , it never actually happened until a crowd actually did go there yesterday after Mubarak 's speech , when he was expected to step down , and really stunned people by not following through on that . \nInteresting to know , at some point , what happened between that speech and the Vice President Suleiman coming on television last night , saying -- explaining what the president had done , between then and now , what was it that made Mubarak , finally , and Vice President Suleiman , finally , face reality ? \nWas it the military coming to them ? \nWas it some sort of new assessment of what was happening on the ground ? \nAgain , at this point , we do n't know . \nWe have just gotten a report that Swiss authorities -- this has , actually , just crossed the wires . \nThe Swiss government has asked banks in that country to freeze any assets that might belong to Egypt 's President Hosni Mubarak or his family . \nThis according to a spokesman for the Swiss Embassy in Washington . \nThe Swiss government saying they do n't know of what funds Mubarak , or his family members , may have in banks in Switzerland , but they are authorizing and they are asking banks in the country to check and to freeze any assets that they think might belong to Mubarak and the family to stop any kind of money transfers , to stop any kind of money being withdrawn from any of those accounts . \nOn Tuesday , apparently , the finance minister in Switzerland asked the banks to look into Mubarak 's assets that might be held in that country . \nBut , apparently , according to him , the banks , yet -- do not , yet , have a clear picture of what kind of money is being held . \nAnd here we see a group of people , the Egyptian flag walking down the street . \nPity anyone stuck in traffic , tonight , in Cairo . \nThey are not going anywhere for quite a while . \nIvan Watson is standing by . \nIvan , we 've just heard that Swiss authorities are trying -- have -- or are asking banks in Switzerland to freeze any accounts . \nWe hear that a lot from people , now . \nThey want -- whether or not they want Mubarak put on trial , they want the money that he is alleged to have taken over the years . \nIVAN WATSON , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : That 's right . \nI mean , that was something we started hearing , Anderson , in recent days , amid some news reports that he had untold wealth , and we started seeing that appear in some of the protest signs , you know , that there should be investigations into corruption , into Mubarak 's alleged wealth , the wealth of his family . \nBy the way , Anderson , the sound of honking horns , here , typically , in Cairo , that 's because of gridlock traffic and frustrated drivers . \nThe sound in Cairo , tonight , they 're not honking their horns out of frustration . \nIt 's a celebration . \nAnd what 's amazing about it is four or five hours ago , the streets of the city were eerily , almost frighteningly , empty , completely empty . \nWe were able to drive through the city , not even pedestrians on the street , and now the people have poured out into the streets and we 're many neighborhoods away from Tahrir Square . \nThe flag waving INAUDIBLE , here . \nStreet parties at almost every intersection . \nI 've seen fireworks and confetti . \nOne woman , I asked her , are you scared about what 's going to come next ? \nAnd she said , no , because the military is taking over and I feel safe with them , and with their help , one day soon , we 'll be able to vote in presidential elections -- Anderson . \nANDERSON : And we hear those horns -- let 's just listen to some of the sounds in Cairo tonight . \nWATSON : It 's going to be a party out here all night , Anderson . \nANDERSON : There have been some estimates , Ivan , estimates of the Mubarak fortune range wildly from -- people say $ 20 billion to $ 70 billion . \nOften , those estimates turn out to be completely or wildly inaccurate . \nSeventy billion dollars would make him the richest man in the world . \nThat seems highly unlikely . \nEven $ 20 billion , which is a low estimate , would be an extraordinary sum . \nEven a billion dollars , frankly , or hundreds of millions of dollars would be extraordinary sums . \nAt this point we , frankly , do not know , nor does anyone , I think , how much money the Mubarak family may have been able to amass over the some 30 years of his reign . \nAnd , I think , you know , one of the things that another woman I was talking to , just now , and she was out with her daughters out celebrating , an American-Egyptian woman , dual national , she said that she had tried to start a business after moving from the U.S. back to Egypt , tried to start up a commercial business , but was stopped almost every -- at every juncture in a way by a system of corruption and graft , she said , that made it impossible to try to build something here and made it such that her daughters who were 18 years old , 20 years old , were all planning to leave the country to study outside of Egypt and pursue a life outside . \nThey did n't see a future here . \nSo if that 's starting at the level of a small business , a system of graft and corruption , you can just imagine how the money would flow upwards to the pharaoh who sat at the top of that financial economic pyramid . \nAnd it 's said the Mubarak family , the sons of Mubarak , have a number of companies that basically kind of get money through links with other foreign companies that do business in Egypt , perhaps through the military as well . \nBut , again , a lot of this will no doubt be investigated down the road as already this regime , in the last few days and weeks , we have seen this regime turning on itself , already starting to investigate itself , kind of throwing former ministers under the bus , essentially freezing their accounts in Egypt , taking their passports so they ca n't get away from the country , already investigating some of the ministers from past regimes under Mubarak . \nCOOPER : And now we 're seeing some fireworks , Wolf , over the square . \nThis , again , extraordinary images . \nAnd we have correspondents all throughout Cairo and we are trying to kind of give you as much of a sense in different parts of the city and just the scope of the celebrations tonight , Wolf . \nBLITZER : It certainly is a celebration in Cairo . \nThe fireworks , the chanting , the singing , the happy people . \nThey -- a lot of them , no doubt , ca n't believe this has happened . \nLet 's listen a little bit , watch the sights and listen to the sounds . \nThis has been a revolution , largely peaceful . \nThere was some brutal violence , yes , for days and , unfortunately , tragically more than 300 people , according to Human Rights Watch , were killed . \nThousands of others injured . \nBut today they 're celebrating . \nThey 're all smiles as Egypt is free . \nThat 's what they 're saying , Egypt is now free . \nLet 's go to Cairo right now . \nCNN 's Fionnouala Sweeney is watching what 's going on as well . \nFirst of all , Fionnouala , tell us where you are . \nCan you see these fireworks going off from your location ? \nFIONNOUALA SWEENEY , CNN CORRESPONDENT : We certainly can . \nI mean , I can tell you as I look here down to my left across the Nile , there is just a sea , a line of car lights and they 're all heading in one direction , which is Tahrir Square just behind me . \nI mean the excitement here is palpable , obviously , but I think some thoughts are beginning to turn now , Wolf , to what 's happened in the rest of the region . \nAnd on that note , we 've had some reaction , for example , from the United Arab Emirates . \nAnd they 're saying they have confidence in the higher military council that 's taking power . \nOf course , the UAE was rather against the protests and against particularly what it called foreign interference . \nWe also heard today from Iran 's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad celebrating the 32nd anniversary of the Islamic Revolution there , saying that these protests below me here and throughout the rest of this country would result in the end of what he calls U.S. and Israel 's interference in the region . \nA big question now , what happens in countries like Jordan ? \nSeveral hundred people demonstrating today in Jordan . \nOne on one side of the Egyptian protesters . \nThey said the Arab world is on fire . \nAnd on the other side of those protests , a rival group , calling for the ouster of the recently appointment Jordanian prime minister . \nAnd , Wolf , let 's not forget Israel , watching this very closely . \nCNN spoke to Avi Dichter a short time ago . \nHe is the former head of Shin-Bet in Israel . \nHe said , more or less that Omar Suleiman was a man that Israel could work with . \nBut Israel , where I was last week , very concerned , particularly along the border with Sinai , that any instability now could affect its security . \nBLITZER : But , Fionnouala , the Israelis , like the United States , have a pretty good relationship with the Egyptian military , which at least during this transition to elections is going to be in charge . \nIs n't that right ? \nSWEENEY : Well , indeed they do and that 's why Avi Dichter , the former head of Shin-Bet said in some comments to CNN in an interview a couple of hours ago , essentially that Omar Suleiman was a man who they said once he gave his word , he stuck by his word . \nHe was a man essentially that Israel can work with . \nBut , you know , everybody is really excited here , as you can imagine , but the dust has to settle . \nAnd when the dust settles , eventually there are going to be questions back as to how this country is going to be run . \nWill the state of emergency be lifted ? \nWill political prisoner , some ten thousand of them , be released ? \nWe also heard this is a fundamental question of human rights coming from the U.K. prime minister , David Cameron . \nDAVID CAMERON , BRITISH PRIME MINISTER : Good evening . \nToday has been a remarkable day , particularly for those people in Tahrir Square and elsewhere who have spoken out so bravely and so peacefully for change in their country . \nEgypt now has a really precious moment of opportunity to have a government that can bring the country together . \nAnd as a friend of Egypt and the Egyptian people , we stand ready to help in any way that we can . \nWe believe it must be a government that starts to put in place the building blocks of a truly open , free and democratic society . \nAnd , of course , what has happened today should only be the first step . \nThose who now run Egypt have a duty to reflect the wishes of the Egyptian people . \nAnd in particular , there really must be a move to civilian and democratic rule as part of this important transition to an open , democratic and free Egypt . \nSWEENEY : And those views of David Cameron being echoed by the German chancellor , Angela Merkel , and the European Union . \nBut just let 's go back to what we were talking about a moment ago , Wolf , yes , people are excited here . \nHosni Mubarak has gone . \nBut the question will remain once the dust settles , and it will be some time yet , has this regime changed and will it be enough to keep the country stable and the region beyond it ? \nBLITZER : Yes , David Cameron welcoming , obviously , what 's going on in Egypt right now . \nThe revolution has succeeded in Egypt . \nIt 's now approaching 8:30 -- it 's 8:22 p.m. in Tahrir Square right now . \nThe celebration , I think it 's fair to say , at least on this night in Cairo , elsewhere in Egypt , only just beginning . \nHala , it 's a momentous occasion and I guess it 's a cliche but history certainly is unfolding . \nThe celebration is just beginning and the process toward a true transition to democracy in Egypt , if indeed that transition unfolds as protesters hope that it will is just beginning . \nFrederik Pleitgen is not too far from where the demonstrators are cheering . \nThey 're waving their flags . \nWe saw small fireworks earlier over Tahrir Square . \nEighteen days is the time that it took for the people in that square , the demonstrators throughout Egypt , to force the resignation of what people thought was one of the most stable autocracies in the Middle East . \nNineteen days ago it was almost impossible to imagine this scenario . \nBut today we 're seeing the people of Egypt celebrating . \nMany when we asked them what comes next , sort of wanting to bask kind of in the joy of the moment . \nThey just want to celebrate today and perhaps think more about the detail tomorrow . \nBut there are challenges ahead . \nFrederik Pleitgen joins us now live . \nWhat 's your vantage point there , Frederik ? \nWhat have people been telling you about what comes next ? \nFREDERIK PLEITGEN , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : What comes next is really one of the big questions . \nBut let me show you our vantage point . \nWe 're obviously overlooking what 's been going on here on the square . \nAnd I can tell you , it is absolutely amazing . \nThere 's people dancing in the street . \nDown there , look , you see a whole crowd of people who are just absolutely excited . \nI think one of the questions that many people ask is , when these democratic elections are going to be taking place . \nObviously a lot of people that I 've been speaking to , Hala , say that they 're quite happy with the military taking over control of this country , at least for an interim period , and then they want to see democratic elections . \nOne of the things that I find the people who were down in Tahrir Square all this time had very little thought about was who their future president is going to be . \nEvery time you ask people who they think should rule this country after Hosni Mubarak , they always say , the people will decide . \nAnd that 's simply because there is really no clear leader . \nClearly a lot of people here are not happy with Omar Suleiman , but they have no idea who they want to come after this , Hala . \nGORANI : And state television is announcing that a statement from the military will come soon . \nEgypt is now ruled by the higher military council . \nPresident Hosni Mubarak a couple of hours ago transferring powers to the military , not to his vice president , seeing as too close to the old guard , the old leadership here or over there , I should say . \nI just got back . \nI 'm still saying here , Frederik . \nSo , looking forward then , we heard from Mohamed ElBaradei that a year sounded to him like a good kind of length of time before elections could take place in the country . \nDo protesters want elections earlier than that , though ? \nPLEITGEN : I think a lot of people would like to have elections earlier than that . \nI think right now we can see the mood that 's going on , on Tahrir Square from people that I 've been talking to really . \nThey 're really in this sort of -- just -- I would say democratic mood . \nThey want power by the people . \nThey want grassroots movement . \nGORANI : All right , we 've got to go to state television for an announcement by the military . \nUNIDENTIFIED MALE -LRB- through translator -RRB- : Oh , people , on this historic and decisive moment in the history of Egypt and with issuing of the decision of President Mohamed Hosni Mubarak to step down from the post of president and assigning the higher council of military to run the affairs of the nation . \nAnd as we all know the gravity and -- unfolding -LRB- ph -RRB- of this issue in face of the demands of our great nation everywhere to bring about decisive changes . \nThe higher military council is studying this issue with the help of God , the greatest , to reach the dreams of our great people . \nAnd a higher military council will later issue more statements to outline the measures and decisions that will be taken and followed , stressing at the same time that this is not a replacement of the logistical -LRB- ph -RRB- nation that we have . \nThe higher military council is expressing all its appreciation to President Mohamed Hosni Mubarak for what he has offered in the path of national service , this in time of war or peace and on his national decision and stance in putting interests of the nation at the forefront . \nAnd in this context , the higher military council is expressing all its appreciation for the life of the martyrs . \nThose who have sacrificed their lives for the freedom and security of their nations and for all the people of our nation . \nAnd God be in our help . \nPeace be upon you . \nGORANI : Go ahead , Wolf . \nIt 's a very brief statement . \nIt wo n't take long to sum it up . \nWOLF : Yes , no , it 's a very interesting statement that that military officer made to the people of Egypt , reaffirming what we had been told was happening , that the Egyptian military , specifically the higher council of the Egyptian military , would now run the affairs of the nation . \nObviously this is a new development for the Egyptian military . \nSomething they 're not necessarily used to . \nThey 're going to have some serious meetings now on what that means . \nI was intrigued and , Hala and Anderson , if you want to weigh in on this , on the appreciation that officer expressed to President Hosni Mubarak , now former President Hosni Mubarak , who made all these sacrifices , he said , for the Egyptian people , but now he 's gone . \nWe think he 's in Sharm el-Sheikh . \nWe 're not exactly 100 percent sure where he and his family are . \nWe do know , and , Anderson , you reported a little while ago , that the Swiss government says they are freezing any financial assets that Mubarak or his family might have in Swiss banks right now and there 's -- anyone can guess how much money they might have . \nVarious estimates from the low billion to as much as 70 billions of dollars that they 've amassed over the years . \nBut it 's clear that the military is now in charge of what 's happening . \nI 'm not exactly sure , maybe one of you can help me , what is going to be the role , if any , of the vice president , Omar Suleiman ? \nIs he running the situation right now or is he out of the situation as well ? \nCOOPER : I believe he 's out of the situation . \nI asked that question to Mohamed ElBaradei , and that was his understanding , as well , that he is gone from the situation , as well . \nWhether or not that 's true , I mean , this is a man , you know , who has long links with the military , who ran the intelligence services , so the whole Interior Ministry which has some million and a half employees by some estimates , secret police , informers , they have far more employees than the military has , the military , I think , has about a half million or so . \nSo it 's not clear to me exactly where Suleiman is , what role , if any , he plans to play . \nI think it 's also to point out , Hala and Wolf , not only did the military officer there want to specifically praise Mubarak , which I think is more of not wanting to humiliate the man -- and we started to hear that from a number of protesters and people like Mohamed ElBaradei , saying it 's important , you know , he does n't need to be humiliated , he does n't need to leave Egypt , but he just needs to go . \nYou also heard from that officer , which we have not heard from Mubarak and we have not heard from the vice president in the last two weeks , him saluting literally saluting what he called the martyrs . \nAnd for those in the audience , our viewers who may be wondering who the martyrs are , I believe he 's referring directly to the people whose lives , the protesters whose lives have been lost in the last two-plus weeks often in these demonstrations . \nIn the last couple of weeks , we would see people carrying posters , excuse me , people carrying posters with pictures of their loved ones who had been killed in the protest movement , and they were called the martyrs . \nSo I think that 's who at the end he was saluting in addition to Mubarak , Wolf . \nBLITZER : Yes , he may have been saluting those martyrs then , at the same time , as a military officer , he may have been referring to the martyrs over the years over the generations in Egypt , specifically the soldiers who died in battle on behalf of Egypt . \nGORANI : Yes , I think listening to that , yes , I think listen to that he was referring to those individuals who lost their lives over the last 18 days . \nThat 's what it sounded like to me . \nThe martyrs , it 's a way of describing in Arabic a very commonly used term for people who 've died sort of in the pursuit of a goal , in this case revolutionary overthrow of the regime . \nBut what I found interesting is that the military is positioning itself very neutrally there as a facilitator , sort of a political transitional entity and institution by on the one hand sort of praising Mubarak and expressing appreciation to Hosni Mubarak , but on the other hand also expressing appreciation to those martyrs as they 're commonly called in Arabic , those people who died in that struggle . \nSo it 's very interesting how in terms of public relations what the military is doing on this important day . \nBLITZER : You know , it 's also fascinating , especially to those of us who watched Egyptian state media over the years , earlier today even before the official announcement from the vice president that Mubarak was stepping down , we saw those anchors , those journalists apologizing to the people of Egypt for the lies in effect that they had been forced to tell over the years on Egyptian state media . \nI do n't know , Anderson , if you caught that or , Hala , if you saw that , but that was a dramatic development when you see these Egyptian journalists on state media apologizing to the people saying we did n't really mean to report all these awful things , but we had no choice . \nCOOPER : Well , you know , Shahira Amin , who was an anchor , resigned two weeks ago or maybe a week and a half ago because she did n't want to tell lies any longer . \nSo some people did make a stand earlier on , but obviously we 're now seeing a number of those anchors saying , you know , that they 're apologizing . \nIt was always interesting to hear from Shahira Amin . \nOnce she had resigned her position , she would describe how the lies were spread . \nThat basically they would get a press release from the Ministry of Interior dictating how they were supposed to discuss the protesters . \nTo talk about foreign influence , that foreigners were behind this , that the protesters were being paid , that there were , you know , foreign powers behind them , that they were eating Kentucky fried chicken and , you know , being fed while in the square , all of which were just lies spread by the state , which State TV very quickly was putting out . \nBLITZER : Yes , it was a major development . \nHala , you followed the Egyptian media for a long time . \nJust to see that unfold and if you had watched , if you had watched the Egyptian media over these past 18 days , Anderson is right , and Ben Wedeman had reported extensively for us about some of the outrageous allegations they were making against these demonstrators at Tahrir Square , allegations saying the U.S. or other foreign powers were funding them , were responsible for them and it was , you know , just wild , wild accusations . \nLet 's go back to Tahrir Square right now . \nArwa Damon is on the scene for us . \nDAMON : Well , celebrations are most definitely continuing . \nThere 's still a live band here . \nPeople still very happy and despite their exhaustion , very willing to continue expressing that . \nI 'm joined now by Ahmed -LRB- ph -RRB- . \nSir , what are your feelings right now ? \nDAMON : And what does this mean for you , for Egypt ? \nWhat sort of changes will you see to your day-to-day life ? \nWe 've had our chains broken . \nIt 's very hard to understand what freedom means until you lose it and you try to find it . \nDAMON : And you 're a businessman with a number of clothing shops around this very square , so you 've obviously taken a very severe economic blow . \nDAMON : How are you going to begin recovering from that ? \nWhat 's the next step for people like you ? \nI 'm looking at how much I can make after this revolution happened . \nIt 's beautiful because it 's just the kids next door who did it , who were unarmed , they had no political agenda , they are not , you know , political parties . \nThey are beautiful kids next door who did it only with determination and Facebook . \nDAMON : You know , this is obviously come at a great cost for all Egypt . \nDAMON : How is this country going to recover moving forward ? \nHow are the various social systems going to be brought back together again ? \nWe were being thefted -LRB- ph -RRB- for more than the amount of upon that it cost Egypt throughout this whole revolution there . \nSo I believe if we just weed out the corruption , we 'll pick up in no time . \nDAMON : And so the future most definitely a bright one , you would say . \nDAMON : The future is a very bright one . \nAs long as the military stands to their word and to give the power to the people , so that 's a very important issue . \nI 'm sorry if I interrupt you here because some people ask me to -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- to ask to free all of the political prisoners who are in prison knowing from them that this is CNN and the whole wide world can be watching . \nDAMON : Not a problem at all . \nThank you very much . \nDAMON : That just gives you an idea of how the revolution -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- . \nIt gives you an idea of the sentiment right now , some of the concerns that people do have for the future . \nThey have one for the moment and they most certainly are riding that wave of happiness right now , but it is going to take quite a lot of time to put the country back together again . \nBLITZER : The work is only just beginning I think it 's fair to say . \nBy the way , we 're just getting word from the White House , the president of the United States , Barack Obama , will address the nation , indeed , the world at 3:00 p.m. Eastern . \nThat 's a little bit less than an hour and a half from now . \nAt 3:00 p.m. Eastern , the president will be in the Grand Foyer over at the White House . \nHe 'll speak out on his reaction to the historic moment in Egypt right now , the revolution , which has succeeded . \nAt 3:30 p.m. Eastern , a half hour later , there will be a briefing at the White House , as well . \nWe 'll , of course , have coverage here on CNN . \nAnderson , all of this unfolding very , very rapidly . \nCOOPER : Very rapidly and a lot of unanswered questions and , again , I mean the story obviously of today and tonight is this extraordinary celebration . \nAnd the pictures tell that story extraordinarily well . \nThirty years of pent-up fear and anger and frustration and degradation exploding in just hours of joy . \nBut again , so many unanswered questions . \nExactly what does this mean to have this military government now ruling ? \nWhat happens , as that man mentioned in the square , to all the political prisoners , to all those who have been detained , an unknown number have been detained . \nWael Ghonim that we spoke to , that Google executive whose on leave who helped start these protests on his Facebook , he brought it up , as well . \nYou know , we do n't know how many -- he said there were as many as maybe a thousand people detained . \nWe , frankly , do n't know . \nI interviewed one reporter last night for radio for Europe who was arrested -- he was a Westerner arrested , held in detention for 28 hours and heard Egyptians around him being electrocuted by authorities and being beaten by people . \nAgain , we do n't know their names . \nWe do n't know how many people are still in detention . \nSo the question is what is going to happen to them . \nWill they continue to rule under emergency rule ? \nRemember , Mubarak has ruled for 30 years , his entire reign under emergency rule which allows secret police to arrest anyone at any time . \nTheir families are n't notified what 's happened to them . \nThere 's no way for their families to track down . \nThey 're in the custody of the secret police . \nSo there 's a lot of unanswered questions about what will happen in the hours and the days ahead . \nBut , again , for the people right now who have suffered for so long , perhaps those questions can wait just a few more hours to be answered while they celebrate freedom , something they are tasting really for the first time in their lives . \nFrederik Pleitgen is in Liberation Square , as well . \nFrederik , from your vantage point , what are you seeing ? \nFREDRIK PLEITGEN , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : Well , what I 'm seeing , Anderson , is how people are turning this main road , this main bridge that goes over the Nile , more and more into a party ground , if you will . \nHolding up traffic , people singing and chanting there in the streets . \nA lot of them , of course , just making their way over here right now . \nIt seems like almost all of Egypt is trying to make its way here . \nAnd , you know , again people as you said , they say right now this is their moment to celebrate . \nThey want to celebrate the fact that Hosni Mubarak has stood down . \nThey 're not really thinking very much , they say , about who the next president is going to be , about how their country will unfold . \nI think one of the things that was important in the military statement that we saw before was that the military was trying to ensure the people here that things would go in a non-chaotic way , in an orderly way , it would go on , their lives would not be unraveled because that 's obviously one of the things that the Mubarak government was talking so much about in the past couple of day . \nRemember when he was talking about how the foreign media was inciting people , how without Hosni Mubarak there would be chaos . \nI think right now the specter of that has sort of gone but the military saying that it would keep things this order . \nAnd so right now this is just a really massive celebration that is going down there on the 6th of October bridge across the Nile which , of course , also was a battleground only a couple of days ago . \nAnd you know , when I was down there , I was seeing people who were just bursting into tears , letting their emotions just go freely because so many of these people , you know , for the past 30 years , they just have n't been able to do that . \nAnd I 've spoken to people who said , they were sort of it their early 30s , and they were saying , you know , I 've never had anybody else except this ruler , anybody except Hosni Mubarak . \nAnd so for them this is obviously al a very new feeling . \nFreedom of speech , freedom of expression , being able to come out here and wave these flags and chant these slogans . \nSo it is an absolutely amazing experience , Anderson . \nCOOPER : And , Frederik , this is going to go on -- I mean , does anyone know how long it will go on for and are there any plans for people ultimately to leave the square ? \nI mean , once the celebrations die down , do we know , will protesters continue to stay in the square or is that -- is there a plan yet ? \nPLEITGEN : I do n't think there 's any plans whatsoever . \nAt least there 's none that I 've heard . \nI mean , this is probably , from the looks of it , is going to go on for the whole night , from what I can see , and probably for the better part of tomorrow as well . \nOf course , almost nobody works here tomorrow , so this is certainly a day that families will go out anyway . \nAs far as the square is concerned , I believe that the things in the square will go on for a couple of days to come simply because the square itself has become so much more , you know , sophisticated . \nThe whole infrastructure there , people were building houses , people were building toilets , they were building wash areas for the people . \nSo I think that will go on for a little bit and then it will probably die down at some point . \nAnd remember that this square has just become such a focal point of this nation that not everybody who is coming there was even a demonstrator . \nThere were people who were bringing their kids there just to show them what all of this is about , and that 's probably going to continue for the next couple of days . \nPeople are going to visit this place as such a historic place , as the place where the revolution that swept Egypt started and where it ultimately ended . \nAnd as the people who started it in that square , eventually brought down this strong man president who had ruled over this country for 30 years . \nPeople who at the beginning were laughed off , people -- you know , young people on Twitter and Facebook posting things on the internet who ultimately then started this thing that snowballed . \nSo I believe this is going to go on for another couple of days and certainly the celebrations down there in the street are going to go on , as well . \nIt might be a little slower in the mornings , but certainly this is going to go on for quite awhile . \nAnd if I may say one thing . \nI was obviously , being a German citizen , was in 1989 , and the celebrations there when the wall came down , took a very long time , Anderson . \nCOOPER : How does this compare in terms of crowds , in terms of atmosphere ? \nPLEITGEN : This -- it 's very , very similar . \nI mean , it really is . \nIf I remember the night the Berlin wall came down when the people were going from East to West Berlin and everybody was cheering on everybody , just a very positive atmosphere , a very chaotic one , but a very positive one . \nThis is definitely something that compares . \nAnd the time frame is almost the same . \nI mean the Berlin Wall was up for 28 years . \nHosni Mubarak was in power for 30 years , so I can certainly relate to what the people down there are feeling at this point in time . \nAnd just the sense of relief they have , the sense of exploring something new , exploring , as I said , these new freedoms . \nYou know , freedom of expression , being able to say whatever you want . \nBeing able to talk to our cameras . \nI mean , you witnessed it , as well , when you were in Tahrir Square , how everybody on that square wanted to come to you and tell you a story , tell you what was wrong with Egypt and tell it to the world . \nThat 's something these people have n't experienced in such a long time . \nYou could feel just how badly they craved to do that now that they can , Anderson . \nCOOPER : Extraordinary , Frederik , thanks . \nLet 's go back to Wolf . \nBLITZER : Anderson , thank you . \nIt 's amazing stories that we 're getting and these stories also , I think , are just beginning . \nWilliam Cohen , the former defense secretary during the Clinton administration , is joining us . \nAlso , the Egyptian journalist Mona Eltahawy , as well . \nLet me get to Secretary Cohen first . \nThe commander in chief of the Egyptian military , field marshal Mohammed Hussein Tantawi , I assume he 's the man in charge right now . \nYou know him , do n't you ? \nWILLIAM COHEN , FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE : I do . \nI worked with him while I was in the Pentagon , and he had served side-by-side with President Mubarak . \nNow , the question is , whether he will continue to remain the head of the military as such , or whether that will pass on to a younger generation remains to be seen . \nBut we had dealings with him , and he was very helpful in terms of communicating our ideals , as well , to that military . \nThat 's one of the many benefits , if you look at how this unfolded . \nThe professionalism of the Egyptian military , I think , also is a credit to our own military that had deep , deep ties with him and really inculcating those kind of values . \nRespecting people , not just using your force to hold them down , but rather responding to it in a very professional way . \nBLITZER : So , you 're encouraged that the military over this transition period towards elections and democracy is in charge . \nCOHEN : I 'm very confident on a temporary basis . \nWe 'll see as evolutionary process whereby the Egyptian people will now expect this military to maintain control and stabilize situations until such time as the building blocks for a true democracy can be established . \nThey 're very confident with that military now . \nBut they do n't want to see a permanent hold by the military over the society . \nBLITZER : Mona , before we talk politics , the future of Egypt , go ahead and just express your thrilling feelings right now , all of us who know you , just want to hear what you have to say . \nMONA ELTAHAWY , EGYPTIAN JOURNALIST\\/ARAB AFFAIRS ANALYST : I 'm ecstatic , Wolf . \nI mean I was on a radio show when the news came through and one of my friends called me from Boston , and he was just crying . \nHe was just saying , Mona , he 's gone . \nMona , he 's gone . \nI 'm going to start crying now just remembering it . \nAnd I went back on the radio show and I was just bawling my eyes out , telling them I can not express to you how ecstatic we all are . \nThere is a long road ahead , no doubt . \nBut this is the happiest day of my life , and we have to stop and celebrate and salute those courageous Egyptians who in 18 days , in a beautiful and peaceful way , brought down a dictator of 30 years . \nIt 's a wonderful moment . \nI can not be happier . \nI 'm so proud to be Egyptian . \nBLITZER : And so what do you say about president -- now former President Mubarak . \nWas he courageous in his final act , agreeing to step down , or basically had no choice and good riddance ? \nWhat do you say to Mubarak ? \nELTAHAWY : Well , first of all I 've got to say as an Egyptian , it 's wonderful to say former president because we have not been able to do that in a long time . \nI think when push came to shove , the armed forces -- and I got to say the Egyptian armed forces , I 'm sure they have great relationship with their American equivalent , but this is the Egyptian armed forces coming through for the Egyptian people with no help whatsoever , basically realizing it was a case of Egypt on one side and Hosni Mubarak on the other side . \nAnd they chose the right side . \nThey did the right thing . \nAnd Hosni Mubarak was trying to dig in his heels . \nIt showed how out of touch he was with what was happening in the country because the more stubborn he became , the more people poured out into the streets in the hundreds of thousands . \nI do n't think he was courageous . \nI think that he would have been courageous if at the very beginning when he realized the people 's will was for freedom , he would have said , I also choose Egypt rather than myself . \nUp until yesterday , he kept talking about himself and not Egypt . \nSo , I think the armed forces -- you know , all Egyptians recognize the armed forces today chose Egypt . \nBLITZER : They certainly did . \nSecretary Cohen , if you 're a dictator in Tunisia , you 're out . \nIf you 're a dictator in Egypt , you 're out . \nWhich dictators in the region should be pretty nervous right now ? \nCOHEN : Well , anyone who 's in power by way of dictatorial authority has to question this . \nEach country is different . \nThere are different economic situations , which might lend themselves to this kind of a revolution . \nBut I was thinking this morning as I was watching this unfold of Robert Kennedy 's words almost 50 years ago , maybe more than 50 years ago . \nHe said that each time a man stands for an ideal or acts to improve the lot of others or strikes out against injustice , he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope . \nAnd crossing each other from a million different centers and daring , these ripples can build a wave or stream that can sweep down the mightiest wall of oppression and resistance . \nThose words , I think , will be quoted by many people throughout the world today . \nThe Egyptian people , in terms of how they brought this revolution about , peacefully and vigorously , I think is going to be an example for many others . \nAnd hopefully it will end with a democratic process that will be put in place in a reasonably foreseeable time so that the Egyptian people can enjoy the fruits and benefits of a prosperous and democratic society . \nBLITZER : I think we have some reaction from Ban ki-Moon , who 's the United Nations secretary-general . \nIf we have that clip ready , let 's roll that now and then we 'll continue this conversation . \nWe 'll get that cued up and we 'll play it for our viewers later . \nLet me ask you what I asked Mohammed ElBaradei , Mona . \nWhat do you want to hear from the president of the United States say ? \nHe 'll be speaking to the American people in about an hour from the White House ? \nELTAHAWY : I want to hear President Obama to say , I salute the Egyptian people for showing the world they have led a peaceful revolution that is an example to everyone . \nAnd I also salute the armed forces for choosing Egypt . \nBut I tell the Egyptian armed forces that it 's very quickly time to move aside and make room for a civilian government in Egypt . \nBecause one of the demands of everyone in Egypt who joined this pro-democracy march and revolution was to get rid of Mubarak and his regime , but also to keep Egypt - or to make Egypt , rather -- a civilian state because we 've been ruled by army men since 1952 . \nSo , I think it 's important to get the moral support from the outside . \nI also want everyone in the United States and across the world to recognize what a turning point this is . \nHow peaceful it was . \nThink of every young Arab now watching what happened in Egypt today and what happened in Tunisia . \nThey 're understanding that through this empowerment , they can bring about change in their countries peacefully . \nThat is an incredibly intoxicating and empowering message because all we hear from the Middle East is violence and passive or violent Arabs . \nWe have now seen active , proactive , empowered Arabs showing the world , we can bring about peaceful change . \nIt 's a wonderful message . \nBLITZER : This is a moment for the United States , Secretary Cohen , right now to not only bask in the moment but to take advantage of this moment and continue to promote democratic reform throughout the region . \nIt started with promoting it in Iraq . \nIt hopefully will spread to Iran , and I would hope that the rulers in Iran are worried about what has taken place here because they can see the power of the people . \nAnd perhaps the United States can continue to raise that lamp of liberty very high , and they can sweep down that wall of oppression that exists in Iran . \nBLITZER : A lot of us remember that speech President Obama gave in Cairo in 2009 . \nI 'm not sure he expected that this would develop . \nI do n't know if that was a result of this or what the impact was , but it was a dramatic speech at the time . \nAnd now we 're seeing what 's happening on the streets of Cairo . \nAnd I suspect it will spread elsewhere . \nMona will be standing by . \nShe 's going to be helping us later when we continue our coverage . \nSecretary Cohen , thanks to you as well . \nWe 're not going anywhere . \nHala , about an hour or so from now we expect to hear from the president of the United States at the grand foyer at the White House . \nWe 'll get his reaction to all of this history . \nBut let me throw it back to you for the time being . \nGORANI : All right . \nWe 've talked a lot about the power of social media in all of this and the massive protest movement that forced the Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak to step down . \nWell , this Facebook page in memory of a young Egyptian businessman killed by police - we can put that up - helped sparked thousands of demonstrators to take to the streets on January 25th . \nI 'm talking about a Facebook page , if we can get it up , that 's fine . \nIf not , just a quick description . \nWe are all Khamid Saeed . \nThis is a young man who was beaten to death . \nWitnesses said two policeman attacked him and killed him . \nAnd this was really the virtual meeting point for pro-democracy , anti- regime protestors in Egypt . \nTwitter and Facebook was also used in Tunisia . \nAnd Wael Ghonim , the Google executive who was detained for 12 days said , look to Facebook for where the next revolution will take place . \nLawrence Pintak is in Seattle -- I believe you are ? \nHe 's the author of `` The New Arab Journalist : Mission and Identity in a Time of Turmoil . '' \nLawrence , really , Facebook is one of the characters in all of this in the way this drama , this revolution , has played out . \nLAWRENCE PINTAK , AUTHOR : Absolutely . \nAnd Hala , you said earlier , an 18-day revolution and you 're absolutely right . \nBut the reality is that these digital activists have been at work for years . \nThere was a strike a couple of years ago that was literally organized off a Facebook page . \nThe Egyptian bloggers had been using YouTube and Twitter to uncover torture and various other governmental malfeasance . \nSo , this has been a revolution , a digital revolution , in the making for quite a while . \nGORANI : What 's interesting is you mentioned quite a while . \nOver the years , I 've covered in the Middle East some of these bloggers that have been harassed and intimidated by secret police for posting videos online of alleged police torture , and that kind of thing , especially in Egypt . \nReally , taking huge personal risks in doing so . \nAnd I found it interesting that we should all look to social media to see where the next revolution will take place . \nWhat did you make of what Wael Ghonim said ? \nPINTAK : Well , I think he 's absolutely right . \nI think social media is a critical tool , organizing tool , for the activists . \nBut we also have to remember a place like Egypt only has about 20 percent Internet penetration . \nSo , this is an important tool for the activists to network . \nBut when the Internet was cut , when SNS was cut , phones were cut , people still turned out in the street because that 's the power of television . \nThe two of these things combined really is a perfect storm . \nWell , jokes are being exchanged now , the mood is a little lighter . \nOne of those tweeters has 30,000 , 40,000 followers , not exactly sure . \nBut so many people follow him . \nA joke he 's sharing , `` After victory Friday in Tunisia and liberation Friday in Egypt , Gaddafi has decided to abolish all Fridays . '' \nSo , now -- is it time , I think , for people to have a bit of chuckle after all the drama that led to this historic moment . \nAnd Lawrence Pintak , we appreciate your take on things . \nGORANI : We 'll take a short break . \nWe 'll be right back . \nStay with us for more of our coverage of this historic day in Egypt and around the Arab world . \n"}
{"id": "8", "time": "2011-02-11", "text": "Debate swirls over Mubarak legacy By the CNN Wire Staff Now that Egypt 's Hosni Mubarak is finally exiting the political stage , the debate over his legacy is growing louder . \nHosni Mubarak ruled Egypt for nearly 30 years , surviving would-be assassins , ill health He was a major player in Mideast politics , helping enforce the Camp David accords with Israel Mubarak did n't allow political dissent , and had a questionable economic track record Mubarak 's fall signals the start of a new era in Arab politics Cairo , Egypt -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- For nearly 30 years , one man dominated Egypt . \nHosni Mubarak , 82 , survived would-be assassins and ill health , crushed a rising Islamist radical movement , and maintained the peace with neighboring Israel that got his predecessor killed . \nHis government 's continued observance of the Camp David accords was the cornerstone of what peace has been achieved in the decades-long Arab-Israeli conflict . \nBut following the revolt that toppled Tunisia 's longtime strongman , demonstrators in the streets of Cairo stood up to riot police , chanting , `` Mubarak , Saudi Arabia is waiting for you . '' \nUltimately , the demonstrations helped bring down the man critics called Egypt 's last pharaoh . \nMubarak decided Friday to step down , Vice President Omar Suleiman said on state television . \nNow that Mubarak is finally exiting the political stage , the debate over his legacy is growing louder . \nLongtime observers of the region say the stability Mubarak purchased for nearly three decades came at the cost of entrenched poverty and repression in the Arab world 's most populous nation . \n`` Egypt is a broken country , '' Fawaz Gerges , a professor of Middle Eastern relations at the London School of Economics , told CNN . \n`` It used to be the jewel of the Middle East . \nIt 's the capital of its cultural production . '' \nBut now , Gerges said , `` Egyptians have no outlets . \nThey do n't feel that they have a sense of hope for the future . '' \nMubarak was a Soviet-trained pilot who was chief of staff of Egypt 's air force during the 1973 Mideast war . \nThe early success of Egyptian pilots against Israel made him a national hero , and then-President Anwar Sadat made him vice president in 1975 . \nSix years later , Sadat died in a hail of gunfire at a military parade , killed by Islamic militants from within the army 's own ranks after he took the dramatic step of making peace with Israel . \nUpon assuming office , one of Mubarak 's first acts was to declare a state of emergency that barred unauthorized assembly , restricted freedom of speech and allowed police to jail people indefinitely . \nHe made extensive use of those powers in the ensuing decades . \nThe Egyptian army put down riots by disgruntled police officers in 1986 , and he threw an estimated 30,000 people in jail when jihadists carried out a string of attacks on tourists . \n`` He pretty much wiped them out , '' University of Michigan Professor of History Juan Cole said . \n`` It 's not an accident that they were in Afghanistan instead of Egypt . '' \nThe government penetrated opposition movements so thoroughly that `` if five people -LRB- sat -RRB- down to plot something , the fifth person -LRB- wrote -RRB- a report to Hosni Mubarak about it , '' he said . \nThe result was `` a regime that has very little legitimacy , but presents itself as something there 's no point in trying to change , '' said Nathan Brown , a professor of Middle Eastern politics at George Washington University in Washington . \nBut Brown said the January 14 overthrow of Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali , who fled to Saudi Arabia after 23 years in power , changed the thinking of many in the region . \n`` I think what the events in Tunisia did was take that sense that nothing could ever change and lead a few people to question it , '' he said . \nMubarak headed off a similar movement in 2005 , when Egyptians mounted large-scale protests to demand fundamental and widespread reform . \nHe intimidated the leaders of the officially banned but tolerated Muslim Brotherhood , harassed middle-class demonstrators and managed to pick off the leadership of those protests , Brown said . \nBut the most recent protest movement had `` no real leadership , so it -LRB- could n't -RRB- be decapitated the same way , '' Brown noted . \nMubarak won four terms as president in elections that were considered formalities . \nHis fifth , in 2005 , was Egypt 's first multi-party presidential vote , but it was widely criticized as a `` sham , '' Cole said . \nMeanwhile , the country 's economy stagnated for the first 20 years of Mubarak 's rule . \nDevelopment picked up in the last decade , fueled by a move away from state control and by billions in tourist dollars , but gains were `` very unevenly distributed , '' Gerges said . \nAbout 40 % of Egyptians currently live in poverty , he noted . \nThe aging autocrat escaped at least two assassination attempts , including a close call in 1995 when Islamic militants opened fire on his motorcade at a pan-African conference in Ethiopia . \nIn recent years , Mubarak had several bouts of illness but never picked a vice president . \nHe was widely believed to have anointed his son Gamal as his successor , but later insisted he never intended for his son to take power . \nIn 2003 , Mubarak collapsed while delivering a televised speech to the Egyptian parliament -- returning later to blame his illness on the flu . \nHe had back surgery in Germany in 2004 , returning in 2010 to have his gall bladder removed . \nHe largely withdrew from public view in recent years . \nHis domestic political situation was closely watched overseas , particularly in the United States . \nIn the past decade , Egypt has been a major player in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks , and it contributed troops to the U.S.-led coalition that drove Iraq out of Kuwait in 1991 . \nIt receives about $ 1.3 billion in military aid from Washington every year -- second only to Israel -- and has received nearly $ 30 billion in economic aid since 1975 , according to State Department figures . \nBut it opposed the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 , and while sticking with Camp David , Egypt 's ties with Israel amount to a `` cold peace , '' Cole said . \nPresident Barack Obama said recently that Mubarak was `` very helpful on a range of tough issues , '' but prodded the Egyptian leader to take steps toward reform . \n`` You can see these pent-up frustrations that are being displayed on the streets , '' Obama said . \nHe urged the Egyptian government to avoid resorting to violence to put down the recent demonstrations , adding , `` I think it 's very important that people have mechanisms in order to express legitimate grievances . '' \nGerges said the Middle East has seen `` the barrier of fear '' removed since the events in Tunisia . \n`` Arabs really no longer feel terrified of the security apparatus '' in Egypt and elsewhere , he said . \n`` We 're going to have a new era of politics .

\nWhat do you want to see from this military government ? \nGHONIM : -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- -- today is like the day for celebration . \nToday is the day for celebration . \nIt 's very hard for me now to even think . \nWe have been -- we have n't been sleeping for a few days . \nWe 've been under a lot of war -- among the media war . \nI 'm was also -- I 'm also mind in the morning -- and a lot of people saying , Wael , you have been all the time logical and not emotional , what 's going on with you . \nSo I need to refer -- restore my calm attitude . \nI 'm not an angry person , and I became an angry person . \nI need to rest and sleep . \nSo does my friends . \nThere are a lot of grateful officials -LRB- ph -RRB- Egypt that we trust . \nThese guys -- there are a lot of people who care about Egypt . \nAnd today I think the problem is solved . \nThe real problem is solved because the people in power were the problem because they did n't want to leave , they were scared of , you know , losing power and then pay the consequences . \nNow as they lost power , there will be no problem . \nCOOPER : How concerned are you that the apparatus of the state repression , the secret police , the interior ministry are all still there ? \nGHONIM : Come on , they are not there . \nWe are much stronger . \nWe are much -- we are much stronger than all these guys . \nWe 're much stronger than all these guys . \nSo I met with the minister of the interior so many times . \nI speak to him one-to-one . \nI told him what I do n't like , I tell him -- so this is what works . \nI , you know , one year ago I said the internet is going to change the political scene in Egypt . \nYou know , today I will tell -- you know , on the 25th , I said that what was Egypt before 25th of January is never going to be like Egypt after 25th of January . \nToday , I 'm telling you Egypt is going to be a democratic state . \nEgypt will start a new start and you will be impressed how fast we will be developing . \nCOOPER : And your thoughts at this moment also must turn to all those who have lost their lives just in the last two weeks , so much blood has been spilled . \nThose people are the real heroes . \nThose people are the real heroes . \nYou know , like there are lots of people that we know that have died . \nAnd also , I would n't forget those who are arrested . \nThere are about a thousand people that no knows where are they right now . \nWe are looking for them . \nWe want them back . \nAnd , you know , the real heroes are the ones in the streets . \nThe real heroes today are every single Egyptian . \nThere is no one leading this . \nAnyone who is telling you he is one of the leaders is not saying the truth . \nThe leaders , you know , on Tahrir Square was every single person there . \nThe leader in Alexandria is every single person there . \nThis was a revolution . \nAs I told you guys on my interview this is a revolution 2.0 . \nJust like Wikipedia how everyone is contributing to the content and there is now master plan . \nOur revolution , everyone is contributing to the revolution and there was no master plan as well . \nCOOPER : Did you believe this day would come when you set up that first website , when you were in detention and blindfolded and held ? \nGHONIM : Certainly , I fully believed . \nI knew this from the day that I left Tunisia . \nI knew it that Hosni is going to leave Egypt . \nCOOPER : You knew from the day the dictator left in Tunisia that Mubarak would leave ultimately ? \nBecause at the end of the day , you know , at the moment you break the psychological barrier of fear , the moment you break the fear , the moment you convince people that if they die it 's better for them to die for a good cause than to live without dignity , which is something that we all worked on in our message at the very beginning , then you should be sure that you are going to win . \nBecause these guys are so corrupted , these dictators do n't care about the people . \nThey care about their lives . \nAnd for them life is much , you know , life is much worth it . \nAnd it 's shame for us , you know , I was -LRB- inaudible -RRB- went I said I was ready to die . \nI love my life . \nWe all want to live . \nWe do n't want to die . \nWe all want to live and we all want to build our country . \nWe all want to make our society free and open-minded . \nWe all want this country to go where it should be . \nWe should be among those great countries in the world . \nWe can do it and we will do it . \nWOLF BLITZER , CNN ANCHOR : Wael , this is Wolf Blitzer in Washington . \nFirst of all , do you trust the High Council of the Egyptian military to supervise implementation towards democracy ? \nGHONIM : I am not a political expert and I am -- such a question right now I would n't answer because I do n't have the background to answer . \nBut what I care about now is that everyone -- I trust 80 million Egyptians . \nI really trust 80 million Egyptians and I really trust that these people in the street now have broken the psychological barrier , after being ready to die for such a good cause of liberating their country , will always make sure that whomever in power is going to work on the people 's agenda . \nAnd I also believe that the army , that the Egyptian army , is so unique . \nAnd the fact that these guys really want the safety of Egypt . \nAnd they have already issued a report that says that they are respecting our demands , that they want to protect our demands , and we want our demands to happen . \nSo , definitely , the Egyptian army is trustworthy right now for me , and I 'm not really worried , because as I said , I trust 80 million Egyptians . \nBLITZER : The other question , Wael , I had is first Tunisia , now Egypt . \nYou 're giving Facebook a lot of credit for this ? \nGHONIM : Yes , for sure . \nI want to meet Mark Zuckerberg one day and thank him , actually . \nBLITZER : Tell us why you think Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg helped get people in Egypt and Tunisia and presumably other countries in the not-too-distant free . \nGHONIM : Well , I ca n't talk about Tunisia . \nI 'm talking on behalf of Egypt , because -- BLITZER : All right . \nSo tell us about Egypt . \nGHONIM : Yes , Tunisia was a bit of a different case . \nThis revolution started online . \nThis revolution started on Facebook . \nThis revolution started in June , 2010 , when hundreds of thousands of Egyptians started corroborating content . \nYou know , like , we would post a video on Facebook , it would be shared by 50,000 people on their walls within a few hours . \nWe -- you know , I always said that if you want to liberate us , society in Egypt , give them the Internet . \nIf you want to have a free society , just give them the Internet . \nThe reason why the Internet is -- like , help you fight the media war , which is basically a war that the Egyptian government , the Egyptian regime playing very well in 1970 , 1980 , 1990 . \nAnd when the Internet came , it really could n't . \nI 'm going to talk a lot about this . \nI plan to write a book called `` The Revolution 2.0 . '' \nThat will say everything about , you know , from the start , from when there was nothing until the end , and highlight the role of , you know , social media and the rest of the stuff . \nHALA GORANI , CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR\\/CORRESPONDENT : Wael , this is Hala Gorani at the CNN Center . \nI was just curious -- you know , you 've become an emblem for so many in this revolution , a figurehead . \nYour name , your appearances in Tahrir Square , I talked about . \nDo you want to now become involved in politics in your country ? \nDo you want to take on a leadership role in this pro-democracy movement , Wael ? \nGHONIM : I want to go back to my company and work . \nI do n't -- I think it will be a big mistake right now for me to be involved . \nAlso , if you read history , you know , the people who help making the revolution should not be part of the revolution afterward . \nI think my mission has been accomplished . \nI just need to work for a few days to make sure that the country is in safe hands , and then I need to disappear from the scene . \nI was not the leader , by the way . \nIt just happened I got all the attention that I do n't deserve . \nAnd I 'm not downplaying the role . \nThis is the truth . \nThe real people you guys should be hosting on your show is not me . \nIt 's actually the people in Tahrir Square who slept 18 days and saw their friends and families dying beside them . \nThose are the real heroes . \nAnd I want you -- I urge you to actually meet a lot of these guys , and do n't put a lot of spotlight on people like me . \nAt the end of the day , my role was accomplished . \nI really wanted this to be an anonymous movement until I was arrested and , you know , they found out . \nAnd then a lot of -- you know , a lot of speculation , and some news agencies announced that I was the admin of the page . \nI really did n't want to be known for this moment . \nI do n't want all the attention to come to me . \nMy mission is over . \nI want to go back to see my kids . \nI want to go back to start working , you know , do some work . \nI want to be a Normal person . \nAnd this is about the Egyptians heroes . \nThose guys -- I 'm not worried about this country having to see all these people in the street right now . \nBLITZER : Wael Ghonim , it 's been a pleasure listening to you and hearing from you . \nMore importantly , congratulations to all the people of Egypt right now . \nThis is truly a revolutionary day in the history of Egypt , a proud country with thousands of years of history . \nWe 're watching new history unfold . \nAnd we want to thank you for all your good work . \nThanks very much , and we hope to stay in close touch with you . \nGHONIM : I want to say a final word . \nThanks to you and you folks on Tahrir Square . \nYou guys have played a great role in saving the lives of hundreds , if not thousands , of people . \nThis regime did not care about the people , and they would have killed a lot of people if there was no international media . \nCNN did a great job . \nYou guys deserve a great recognition from all the Egyptian people . \nWe 're not going to forget your role . \nAnd I wanted to clarify when I said I did n't want to talk to international media . \nIt was only because I do n't want the regime to start doing media -- I have nothing against the American people , of course . \nMy wife is American . \nAnd I also have nothing against international media . \nIt 's just the fact that the regime had been , you know , misleading all the Egyptians and telling them the wrong messages . \nYou guys are heroes , as well . \nYou are part of the revolution . \nYou should be proud of yourself . \nBLITZER : Well , we just want to say the whole world was watching what was happening on the streets of Cairo , in part because of us , but in part because of other television satellite networks , in part because of you and what millions of Egyptians were doing on Facebook , on Twitter , and all sorts of other social network sites . \nAnderson or Hala , do you have a final thought you want to share with Wael before we let him go ? \nCOOPER : Wael , we just got a thing crossing the Reuters wires saying that Egypt 's Supreme Military Council will sack the cabinet , suspend both houses of parliament , and govern with the head of the Supreme Court . \nThat just tells me what I thought of the military . \nThese guys do n't want to be in power . \nThese guys want Egypt to come back . \nI think that we are on the right track . \nI think that even if -- I 'm not scared . \nI 'm not afraid of -- I mean , I do n't fear the history . \nAs I told you , even if I do n't trust anyone , I just 80 million Egyptians . \nThis is the time where history is being rewritten right now . \nAs I said on Twitter before , that day -- you know , the last line of corruption and , you know , oppression has been written . \nWe took a pen from them , we flipped the page . \nAnd now we 're drawing our future . \nWe are dreamers , and we made it happen . \nAnd it 's time now to celebrate for a couple of days , and then go back and start thinking about , how can we develop the strategy and what 's the best for us ? \nGHONIM : Wael , I just have one question . \nI think it 's going to be one of those moments when we all remember , you know , where we were when a historic event took place . \nWhere were you and what was your immediate reaction when you heard Omar Suleiman say the president has stepped down ? \nI was actually in my mom 's house with a lot of -- you know , we were meeting in my mom 's house a lot to decide -- like , a lot of activists . \nAnd we were having -- it was sort of like the center of my plan , of my planning session . \nSo I was there . \nAnd all of a sudden , like , I heard my mom screaming . \nI went out and , you know , it was amazing . \nShe started hugging me and kissing me and hysterically crying . \nAnd it was -- you know , the rest of the family came . \nIt was really good . \nBLITZER : All right . \nLet me just thank Wael again . \nWael , you 'll be happy to know the Twitter universe is exploding right now with your words that you want to meet Mark Zuckerberg . \nDo n't be surprised if you get a call from him sometime soon . \nWe wo n't be surprised either . \nI mean , ask him to call me . \nAsk him to call me . \nBLITZER : He 'll be calling you . \nI would n't be surprised . \nYou 'll let us know how that conversation goes . \nLet 's go to -- I think we 're going to go to Ivan Watson . \nHe 's over at the presidential palace . \nExcuse me , Arwa Damon . \nShe 's in Tahrir Square . \nLet 's go to Arwa first . \nWe 'll check in with Ivan in a few moments . \nBut Arwa , set the scene for us . \nAnd do me a favor when you 're there . \nI want to hear from the crowd . \nTake a moment and let 's hear what the folks are saying . \nARWA DAMON , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : First of all , the scene here is something completely unimaginable . \nThe ambience , the energy that has been emanating from these demonstrators who have been here day in , day out , for more than two weeks now , Wolf , they have truly achieved the unimaginable , and they 're fully aware of that . \nTo think that demonstrations that began through the Internet , through Facebook and Twitter , have now resulted in one of the Middle East 's longest-standing dictators stepping aside , it 's something that no one , not just me , in the entire region ever imagined could be possible . \nThe crowds are so happy at this point in time . \nThey erupted in complete celebration . \nStrangers hugging each other . \nPeople praising one another saying , `` Thanks to God , '' calling Mubarak -- keep bearing in mind , they still want to hold him accountable for the billions of dollars that he has managed to gather over the years that he 's been in power . \nThey also want to hold him accountable for the blood that has been spilled here . \nBut at least now they know and they say that that blood has not been spilled in vain . \nAnd I 'm sorry , Wolf . \nI did not catch the second part of your question . \nBLITZER : I want to hear a little bit of the sound from the people in Tahrir Square . \nIf you or your photographer can get that microphone up , let 's just listen and then come back in a few seconds and you 'll translate what we 're hearing . \nJust be quiet for a second . \nDAMON : How are you feeling ? \nDAMON : Wolf , I do n't know if you caught that , but two young men here very excited , unable to speak , unable to put their emotions into words . \n-LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- they 're busting out in song right now . \nWe 're not just a bunch of people . \nWe 're not just a bunch of people anymore . \nDAMON : Wolf , I do n't know if you heard all of that , but there you have it . \nThe crowd here now -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- . \nBLITZER : Yes , it 's hard to hear , but we made it out . \nThese people are really , really excited , Arwa . \nLet 's listen in once again , see if we can make out what 's going on . \nDAMON : Wolf , if you 're still with me , this is truly an incredible moment . \nCOOPER : Wolf -- one of the things , Wolf , that man was just saying is , `` We 're just not a bunch of kids . '' \nAnd what he 's referring to is comments made by Vice President Suleiman and President Mubarak over the last two weeks , basically categorizing these people as just young people kind of full of youthful exuberance , but who need to go on home , get back to work , go back to school . \nAt one point , the vice president was even saying , we 're not going to push them out , but we 're going to tell their parents to bring them home . \nIt was a patronizing attitude which infuriated many , and particularly last night , in the comments made by Suleiman and particularly by Mubarak . \nIt really angered people , feeling like they were -- like the blood that they had spilled and the sacrifices they had made had been ignored and was being -- and that they were being disrespected , as many people feel they 've been disrespected over the last 30 years by the secret police and by uniformed police there who kind of have a very heavy hand and a cavalier attitude and feel they can do whatever they want . \nIvan Watson is by the presidential palace . \nIvan , the scene there is , I assume , very similar to Liberation Square . \nBut this is the first time -- it was only in the last 24 hours that we had started to see even crowds going as far as the presidential palace . \nIVAN WATSON , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : That 's right . \nJust a few thousand people here this afternoon , and the crowd starting swelling . \nAnd when the news came out , my God , it was an explosion . \nNow it 's a big street party here . \nYou 've got people honking their horns . \nThere were fireworks , people throwing confetti , dancing in the street right here , as well . \nAnd what 's interesting , Anderson , before , many of the demonstrators were predominantly young men . \nBut now families are out in the streets with their kids . \nAnd I 'm right next to a 32-year-old out Rania Zaid -LRB- ph -RRB- , who is out here with her husband and little son Ali . \nWhy are you here ? \nHow do you feel right now , Rania -LRB- ph -RRB- . \nRANIA ZAID -LRB- ph -RRB- , PROTESTER : I 'm very happy because of the revolution . \nAnd I finally feel secure for my children . \nEgyptians and their culture and history really deserve freedom . \nWATSON : And people here saying they 've never seen a party like this before , Anderson . \nIt 's really -- I expect there will be dancing in the streets all night tonight here in Cairo -- Anderson . \nCOOPER : It 's incredible to see these pictures , Hala , that we 're looking at from Liberation Square . \nRight before , we were seeing the overpass , the highway overpass where , just a week ago , there were pro-Mubarak mobs throwing rocks from -- looks like there is a large bonfire in one part of the square . \nLet 's listen in . \nFrederik Pleitgen is there overlooking the scene . \nFrederik , are those fireworks or some sort of incendiary device someone is just kind of waving around ? \nFREDERIK PLEITGEN , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : Yes . \nI mean , it 's an absolutely amazing scene here . \nYou were talking about this highway overpass , Anderson , just a second ago . \nIf we pan down there , I can tell you that right now , it 's a big street party that 's going on . \nThe people are dancing in the streets . \nTraffic seems to be backed up almost all the way to Sudan , it looks like , there 's so many cars coming in . \nThere 's people walking around with giant Egyptian flags . \nAnd one of the interesting things that happened right after we heard the announcement , or shortly after , is that you 'll remember those barricades where that street fighting was going on just a couple of days ago , where the pro-and-anti-Mubarak protesters were beating up on each other . \nAll those barricades just toppled down , and an amazing amount of people charged onto Tahrir Square . \nAnd that 's where the crowd keeps going and going . \nThere 's more and more people now that these boundaries have come down who are charging in there . \nMeanwhile , right in front of us , on that big highway overpass , it 's becoming more and more of a parking lot , as there 's almost no way to get through here . \nPeople just absolutely dancing in the street , setting off fireworks , and walking around with these giant Egyptian flags . \nAnd really , the interesting thing is also the cheering just has n't died down ever since the announcement was made . \nAnd there still is a massive stream of people coming towards Tahrir Square . \nIt seems like thousands , tens of thousands , are walking over the streets below us , and also on that highway overpass -- Anderson . \nCOOPER : Frederik , I think it was exactly a week ago when you were -- had snuck back into the square after two days of heavy fighting . \nYou made your way into the square and actually were behind the barricades looking at the rocks and all the weaponry that the peaceful crowds there had had to try to assemble to defend themselves . \nIt 's an extraordinary turn of events one week later to see that same spot full of nothing but joy . \nIt 's an amazing turn of events . \nAnd , I mean , I remember that you were down there , as well , in that area when those people were facing off and those street battles were so vicious . \nI mean , if you just think back at all the things that we saw when we were down there , the camel and horse charge , the rocks flying back and forth , the sticks , as you said , those people who were fortifying those positions for such an amount of time , and then to have this end so peacefully is really a remarkable thing . \nAnd it 's something that we 've been seeing ever since those pro- Mubarak demonstrators came off the street , is that this crowd has just become absolutely peaceful . \nThey were still quite wary that the military might try and take the barricades down , might try and drive them off the square . \nHowever , the crowd itself , the anti-Mubarak protesters , always a very peaceful crowd , always intent on stopping violence , never letting a situation get out of hand . \nThat 's certainly the way it has been over the past couple of days . \nAnd one of the interesting things , Anderson , I have to say , form yesterday , last night , when we were hearing Mubarak 's speech , people were so angry . \nBut people then came up to me and they told me it is important that they can be angry , but they can not get violent , because they knew that their message was going to be much more powerful if they did n't become violent . \nAnd many of them believed that Hosni Mubarak was trying to incite them to be violent so that he could mount a crackdown . \nBut they said it is something that they can not do , and they really felt that their message would just have that much more impact if they remained nonviolent . \nAnd as we can see it seems to have had just that effect -- Anderson . \nGORANI : Fred , I have a quick question . \nWhere are all those tanks that were in Tahrir Square -- BLITZER : Hala -- hold on one second , everybody . \nJust stand by for one second . \nThe vice president of the United States , Joe Biden , is in Kentucky , and we 're told he 's speaking right now about Egypt . \nJOSEPH BIDEN , VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES : And we stood for and we continue to stand for a set of core principles . \nThe first is that violence and intimidation against peaceful demonstrators is totally , thoroughly unacceptable . \nSecondly , that the universal rights of the Egyptian people must be respected and their aspirations must be met . \nAnd thirdly , that the transition , the transition that is taking place , must be an irreversible change and a negotiated path toward democracy . \nNow , I would add one last point . \nAnd I think Mitch would agree . \nEven in this contentious political climate in which we work , on this issue the United States is largely speaking with one voice , Democrats and Republicans alike , speaking with the same voice . \nThis unity has been important , and it will be even more important in these delicate and fateful days ahead . \nSo I will not speak more about this today . \nI had planned on speaking more about it , but it 's much more appropriate that we all wait . \nAnd the president will deliver his statement on this in about an hour . \nBut what is at stake in Egypt and across the Middle East is not just about Egypt alone . \nIt 's not -- it will not just touch Egypt alone . \nYou may remember that all this began when a fruit vendor in Tunisia , fed up with the indignity of a corrupt government and a stagnant economy , literally set himself on fire . \nAnd in doing so , ignited the passions of millions and millions of people throughout that region . \nWord spread across national boundaries , and movements emerged , led by people no older than some of the students in this room using some of the same social media tools that the students in this room and many of you use , which I might add is a powerful example of our increasingly interconnected world . \nIt 's a vivid demonstration of the transformative times in which we live , times that many of you will have the opportunity to literally shape . \nFew generations ever have the opportunity just to bend history just a little bit . \nFew ever have that opportunity . \nThis generation and we do . \nAs we began the second decade of this young century , so much is in flux -- BLITZER : All right . \nSo there you have a little preview of what the president of the United States might be saying within about an hour or so from now . \nJoe Biden , the vice president , speaking in Kentucky as history unfolding in Egypt right now . \nHe says this is a pivotal moment in history right now . \nA fair statement indeed . \nKate Bolduan is over at the White House . \nAbout an hour or so from now we 'll be seeing and hearing the president of the United States . \nKate , what are they saying at the White House ? \nAny immediate reaction beyond what we just heard from the vice president ? \nKATE BOLDUAN , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Well , Wolf , we 're hearing -- the morning started pretty slowly and pretty quiet around here , and it is abuzz here at the White House right now . \nWe 're told that President Obama was informed of President Mubarak 's decision to step down when he was in the Oval Office , during a meeting in the Oval Office . \nAnd then the president himself stepped out of the Oval Office to the outer oval to actually watch several minutes of television coverage as the crowds were erupting on the streets of Cairo and really across Egypt . \nAnd what we heard from Vice President Biden right there , when he talked about the core principles that the U.S. stands for , that mirrored almost exactly what President Obama said in his strongly - worded statement that he put out last night talking about the universal rights of the people of Egypt needing to be respected , as well as a key phrase that -- a key phrase calling for `` concrete and irreversible political change to be set into action . '' \nI 'm sure that we 'll be hearing more of this from President Obama . \nAs you mentioned , we 're expecting to hear from him probably in about an hour to get his reaction to what is all unfolding on the streets of Cairo and what he is learning . \nBut I 'll tell you this , Wolf . \nOne of the last things that President Obama said in his statement last night I think is -- probably we 're going to hear more of in the days to come , as well as this afternoon . \nHe says that , `` I know the Egyptian people will persevere , and they must know that they will continue to have a friend in the United States of America , '' reaffirming that the U.S. supports the people of Egypt and really reaffirming what we have heard from this president all along , that the future of Egypt lies in the hands of the Egyptian people . \nBut as one White House official has told our John King , it 's a pretty unpredictable chapter that we are now entering . \nAnd I 'm looking forward to hearing from President Obama in about an hour and what he sees as the path forward could be -- Wolf . \nBLITZER : As they celebrate in Cairo , in Tahrir Square , we 'll be getting ready to hear from the president of the United States . \nWe 'll have live coverage here on CNN and CNN International in one hour or so from the White House . \nLet me bring back Hala Gorani . \nHala , I know that U.S. officials are relieved , at least right now , that the Egyptian military is taking charge , because the U.S. does have a very strong , important relationship with the Egyptian military , the highest leaders , the top commanders of the Egyptian military . \nAnd they have confidence that the Egyptian military right now , at least for a transition to democracy , to free and fair elections , they 're confident that the Egyptian military , better than any other institution in Egypt , can get this job done . \nSo they 're taking a little breath at the White House and they 're pleased by this latest turn of events . \nGORANI : Yes , they have a strong relationship with the Egyptian military . \nPeople in the streets are telling our reporters that they trust the military to transition the country . \nNow , that 's , of course , going to be something we 're going to have to look out for . \nBut look at these crowds , a live image of Tahrir Square . \nFred Pleitgen is , I think , in the middle of all of this . \nFred , we just the viewers to take in the atmosphere here . \nJust tell us what you 're seeing and what you 're hearing . \nPLEITGEN : Well , I have this great vantage point which is , of course , right above everything that 's going on here . \nAnd I can tell you it 's absolutely amazing to see . \nIt seems like almost all of Egypt trying to come here with their cars . \nPeople have been honking . \nPeople are waving the Egyptian flag . \nAnd there 's so many people who are just sort of dancing on the street , dancing around . \nIt really is a remarkable scene , especially in light of the fact that we saw so much violence in this area . \nAs you can see , the sort of massive highway overpass , one of the main thoroughfares through Cairo , is just starting to turn into a parking lot with more and more people coming here . \nAnd on the square , you can just see how it 's getting fuller and fuller as more and more people are coming in here , also waving Egyptian flags . \nWe 've been able to speak to some people who are down there , and many of them said that this was really the beginning of a new era for this country . \nThere were some actually who were calling for President Hosni Mubarak to be tried in court , but others were just saying they truly believe this is a new beginning for their country , this is their chance for freedom and democracy . \nAnd one of the interesting things that some were saying to us is they were saying that they hope that America will not intervene , will allow them to do this , and that America will have patience with these people who have just apparently , they believe , won their freedom . \nSo it really is amazing . \nAnd there 's so many people , also , Hala , who we saw who were crying , in tears . \nIt 's an absolutely remarkable scene -- Hala . \nWhere is the military , briefly ? \nAre the tanks still out there in Tahrir ? \nThe tanks still are out there . \nPLEITGEN : And if we -- I 'm sorry . \nIf we pan down there , you 'll see a couple of people that are sort of gathering around the tanks . \nSo the tanks are actually still there . \nThey 're keeping their positions . \nAnd the people , as you can see , they 're really obeying the orders . \nThere 's a bunch of cars in front of that tank . \nThey 're not moving past the tank to try and go down the highway overpass , although it seems some of them might have been trying to do that . \nSo it does appear , even though you have all of this going on , from our vantage point , at least , as though the military is still very , very well in control . \nWe have not had any reports of any violence , we 've had not any reports of any buildings , government buildings , or anything being damaged . \nIt still seems as though there is that amount of respect that we 've been seeing between the military and the people who -- the former protesters , who I guess are now people who are just celebrating this moment . \nSo it is a very peaceful moment . \nThere 's nothing of any sort of tension in the air between the military and the people . \nThe situation seems to be very much under control -- Hala . \nFred Pleitgen , thank you -- Anderson . \nCOOPER : Hala , we have with us watching this as well , Jim Woolsey , the former director of the Central Intelligence Agency . \nObviously , as a former CIA officer , as an analyst , it 's the job not to get I guess too caught up in the moment , but try to look down in the hours , days and weeks ahead . \nI point out today is actually the 32nd anniversary of the Iranian Revolution , a revolution which began with extraordinary excitement and was quickly overtaken in unexpected ways . \nAs an intelligence officer , what do you want to -- what questions do you need answered in the days ahead ? \nJAMES WOOLSEY , FMR . \nCIA DIRECTOR -LRB- via telephone -RRB- : Well , your reporter just quoted an Egyptian there on the street as saying Egypt now has a chance for freedom and democracy . \nAnd I think that is exactly the right way to phrase it , because there will be institutions and people trying to undermine that chance . \nI think first among them would be Iran , and Iran working with the Muslim Brotherhood the way they work with Hamas in Gaza . \nAnd the Egyptian military , because of its traditions and its being a draftee army and so forth , has good relations , as you 've seen , with the Egyptian people . \nAnd I think they will not be the problem . \nThe problem will be exactly , Anderson , what you drew the allusion to , the possibility that something may happen along the lines of what happened in Iran in '' 78 and ' 79 . \nAnd if that does happen , it will be Ahmadinejad and his regime , operating through Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood and similar organizations , to try to undermine this great and remarkable and wonderful opportunity for Egypt . \nCOOPER : It seems critical for that not to happen -- I mean , the critical steps for that not to happen are to try to build up democratic institutions in Egypt , which Mubarak , frankly , systemically dismantled , eliminated over the course of 30 years . \nSo the idea , I suppose it would concern you if there were calls for immediate elections because there really are n't many organized opposition forces that have any legitimacy other than the Muslim Brotherhood . \nWOOLSEY : Right , and that 's what happened in Gaza . \nHamas called for immediate elections , and we got one vote , one man , one vote once , and it 's now a theocratic dictatorship . \nRevolutions in the past have gone this way for all sorts of reasons . \nThe French revolution went that way . \nThe bad guys eventually took over . \nThe same thing happened in the Russian revolution ; it 's happened in Iran . \nThe phrase `` the revolution devours its children is an old one , '' and we all have to do everything we possibly can to work with the forces of stability and change in and Democratic and law-abiding direction in Egypt to help them economically , to help them politically and see to it that this does not become an Islamist operation the way Iran has and Gaza has , and I 'm afraid Lebanon may be on the way to being . \nCOOPER : When you heard Wael Ghonim saying -- calling this revolution 2.0 saying that Facebook , you know , is where this began for him at least , that 's where he started his activism , does the intelligence community understand that at this point ? \nI mean , are they on top of that kind of the Facebook , the Twitter , as a driving force in some of these movements ? \nWOOLSEY : They may be beginning to be . \nI know people who for years now have been trying to get them to help get the right types of equipment and software into places like Iran in order to take advantage of people 's desire for freedom . \nWe should have been doing exactly what has happened in Egypt . \nWe should have been trying to help foster that in Iran and help set up servers , protect their Facebook , protect their Twitter , everything . \nAnd we really have not . \nBut this is a good step because the administration is now starting to criticize the Iranians ' dictatorship for being hypocritical . \nIt was just on your screen . \nI wish they had done that and helped with the Facebook and the rest a year-and-a-half ago when all of the brave Iranians were slaughtered by the Iranian government . \nBut if we can maintain our support for a movement toward democracy and freedom and the rule of law , not just by one quick election in Egypt and do the same thing in Iran and in the rest of the Middle East , I think we can put aside this thing that Charles Krauthammer this morning . \nA great son of , he said until a week or two ago it was really just supposed to be George W. Bush , Tony Blair and a handful of neo-cons who thought there could be democracy and freedom in the Middle East . \nAnd it looks like we 've got a lot of Egyptians neo-cons out there . \nWhere did they come from ? \nCOOPER : Do you have any doubt there are other dictators in the Arab world and autocrats who are watching this with fear in their hearts ? \nWOOLSEY : I think there are probably quite a few , and if we can help work with them as we did at the end of World War II when the communists were working very hard , France , Italy and elsewhere to take over , we worked with the forces for democracy . \nWe had CIA operations , we had economic aid , we had the Marshall Plan . \nWe worked very hard , and we helped keep western Europe free during the Cold War because of some of the decisive steps that Harry Truman and others made in beginning in the late '40s . \nAnd we need to do that again . \nWe need to be on the side of the rule of law and a quick evolution toward democracy , but not necessarily in favor of really quick votes in places we do not want more Gazas with Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood organization running . \nCOOPER : Want to break back in Wolf , as we continue to watch , Wolf , these extraordinary developments . \nWOLF BLITZER , CNN HOST , `` SITUATION ROOM '' : And it might be good time to -- maybe Jim Woolsey wants to listen in to get some reaction from outside Egypt throughout the region . \nLet 's go to CNN 's Reza Sayah . \nHe 's in Islamabad , Pakistan , where folks are watching as they are all over the world especially in the Muslim world and the Arab world , Reza , with keen interest . \nWhat are you hearing ? \nREZA SAYAH , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : Well , Wolf , we 've been monitoring reaction from Iran , not so much in Pakistan . \nOf course , the images we 've seen today and over the past couple of weeks in Egypt remind many people of the uprising after the disputed 2009 elections in Iran . \nThat 's when Iran 's opposition movement to so - called green movements emerged , and I think a lot of supporters of that opposition movement today are looking at what 's happening in Egypt , the celebration in Cairo and I think for them , it 's bittersweet sentiments . \nThey were a civil rights movement , as well , and I think by nature , civil rights movements are very happy and thrilled when other civil rights movements are victorious . \nBut I think Iran 's opposition movement is looking at this celebration tonight and saying , this could have been us , this should have been us . \nThey too gave lives and lost lives in the streets of Tehran and other cities in Iran . \nThey too fought in the streets for much longer than the Egyptian movements did , but they did n't enjoy the rewards that the Egyptian people are enjoying tonight . \nSo , I think it 's a bittersweet moment for Iran 's opposition movement . \nThe uprising in Egypt had created a lot of buzz in Iran , and the question , could this spark a comeback for the green movement that had been mostly snuffed out on the streets . \nAnd I think when you look at what 's happening tonight with the resignation of President Mubarak , that 's going to add fuel to the fire . \nCould there be a comeback ? \nMany of you already know that on Monday , there 's been a protest , a rally proposed for by the two leading opposition leaders , Mir Hossein and Mousavi and -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- . \nIran 's hard-line leadership was quick to object to it and warn everybody not to come out . \nSo , it 's going to be very interesting to see what happens on Monday . \nWill the events in Cairo tonight spark a comeback in the streets of Tehran on Monday ? \nIf it does , if Iran 's green movement makes a comeback on Monday , there 's going to be very little doubt that it had a lot to do with the events in Egypt tonight . \nBLITZER : Yes , those dominos are beginning to fall . \nTunisia , Egypt , what 's next ? \nWell , you heard Wael Ghonim , the revolutionary , the protest leader in Egypt predict , look at Facebook and you 'll find out what is next . \nSo we 'll take a closer look at Facebook and we 'll take a look and see how this plays out in Iran , specifically among other countries in the region . \nReza , thanks very , very much . \nLet 's go back to Hala . \nShe 's watching all of this unfold , as well . \nGORANI : It 's 7:37 p.m. right now in Cairo , Egypt , a country that 's gone through a revolution . \nThe power of the people taking down this dictator in power for more than a generation . \nAnd Nic Robertson is overlooking Tahrir Square , the beating heart of this pro-democracy movement . \nWhat are you seeing from your vantage point ? \nWe 're looking at these pictures along with the rest of the world , Nic . \nTruly an historic , historic moment for that country and for the rest of the region , as well . \nTell us what you 're seeing . \nChecking that Nic Robertson is can hear me as we continue to let the pictures speak for themselves , really -- NIC ROBERTSON , CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : -- it just gives you an idea of the situation here that it is a carnival atmosphere . \nIt is people singing , people dancing , forming circles , dancing in circles , traditional dancing . \nBut I think while all this euphoria is going on here , it 's interesting to pause for a moment . \nI was talking earlier on with an Arab diplomat who has a very keen sense of what Saudi officials are thinking at this time . \nAnd he told me that just this afternoon , President Mubarak called King Abdullah in Saudi Arabia and told him that he was stepping down . \nNow , we know over the last few days that King Abdullah of Saudia Arabia has told president Mubarak to hang on , to stay in leadership , not to leave the country because this is something of great concern for Saudi Arabia . \nI talked with this same diplomat since President Mubarak has stepped down . \nand he 's told me that this is a very worrying situation for Saudi Arabia . \nThis is not what they wanted to happen here . \nThis message that a social network revolution can topple a leadership is very destabilizing for the region . \nThey believe that the only good thing that 's come out of the situation so far here in Egypt is the fact that the army is in control , and from what we 've seen down here in Tahrir Square this evening , the people very much support the army soldiers standing atop their tanks , standing at the site of their tanks being kissed by the people , hands being shaken . \nI saw one little boy with an Egyptian flag painted across his face , target a soldier 's sleeve . \nHe was so small , and the soldier bent down , and this young boy kissed the soldier on his cheeks . \nThat 's the sort of thing we 're seeing here . \nThat 's the affection people are showing for the army . \nIt does seem to be perhaps the only thing the people have in common with some of the leadership in the region . \nSaudi Arabia , in particular , the only thing they can take away from this right now is the fact that the army has a strong control and leadership role , Hala . \nGORANI : And Nic , we hear from some contributors who have n't necessarily been to Egypt , in fact , about fears coming from the United States . \nOther countries that Islamist movements would take over if snap elections took place , for instance . \nBut describe the diversity of the crowd . \nThat 's one of the things that struck me most , really , is the representative sort of -- how representative of society as a whole these demonstrators are . \nROBERTSON : And right now , it 's exactly as you saw it , Hala . \nIt 's a huge cross-section . \nA lot of young people , men , women , children , people coming down here with their families . \nAlmost surprising , you would think families would bring their families into this atmosphere . \nBut it 's a celebration . \nThis is weeks of relief . \nHow this will turn out being called out in raw emotion , raw euphoria , an electric atmosphere where everyone is represented here . \nThe Muslim Brotherhood , who people have feared could become the dominant political force here , really do n't have the political strength as people see it at the moment to become a dominant force . \nThey 've got political organization , some of the opposition groups have n't had . \nBut in a true democracy and other groups would have a chance to find their feet , build a power base , build support . \nAll these young people that signed up to Facebook to come out here on January the 25th , they 're not all Muslim Brotherhood . \nThese are all young people who are doing this out of the aspiration to have this revolution that we 've now witnessed here in the last few hours . \nSo , the notion that an Islamic group could come to the forefront here really does n't seem to be borne out by with we see on the streets . \nAnd even if you think about the Muslim Brotherhood , I was talking with a young man recently who was a third-generation Muslim brotherhood , but left the organization , an extreme intellectual . \nLeft the organization as other young followers had because he did n't think that they had a good vision for the future . \nThe young elements of the Muslim Brotherhood are also using Facebook and Twitter , and a part of this revolution , as well . \nAnd they do n't aspire to many of the things that people often fear that they might . \nSo , a huge diversity and huge current of differing opinions here , Hala . \nGORANI : All right . \nInterestingly , a leaderless pro-democracy movement . \nAnderson , we 'll have to see in the coming days how they organize themselves and what their relationship with the military morphs into , eventually . \nCOOPER : One person who has no doubt been thinking about that is Mohamed ElBaradei , Nobel laureate , also a man who returned to Egypt weeks ago to take part in this movement and is talked about as a potential leader of a future Egypt down the road . \nDr. ElBaradei , first of all , where were you when you heard the news , and what went through your mind and your heart ? \nDR. MOHAMMED ELBARADEI , NOBEL LAUREATE\\/EGYPTIAN OPPOSITION LEADER -LRB- via telephone -RRB- : Well , I was at home , and , you know , I have been going through up and down since yesterday hoping to hear that piece of news , and it finally came . \nIt was just a sense of liberation for me , for every Egyptian . \nA sense of emancipation of the whole Egyptian people , and for the first time , Egypt has a chance to be democratic , to be free , you know , to have a sense of - Egyptians can have a sense of dignity , of freedom . \nSo it 's amazing , it 's just like 180 degrees . \nIt 's something we never experienced in our lifetime . \nCOOPER : We were just talking to Jim Woolsey , a former director of the CIA , who was pointing out in the past other revolutions which have started out with such exuberance sometimes get betrayed . \nHow does that not happen this time ? \nWhat do you see happening in the weeks ahead ? \nELBARADEI : We -- I hope , you know , that we have to be -- the army is that to have to of course , share power with the people . \nI think , you know , with 10 million people in the street every day , I think the message was not only sent to Mubarak but the army that the people have to be in control . \nAnd we would have to be vigilant , we will have to ensure during the transition period we would have all the guarantees for a free and fair election . \nAll the guarantees for becoming a democratic institutions . \nAnd I have no doubt that people after going through what they have gone through are not ready to go back or to see their revolt , revolution aborted . \nCOOPER : Do you know , does Vice President Suleiman still have a role at this point ? \nIs he still vice president ? \nELBARADEI : I think , as far as I know , he is gone . \nI think , you know , because the army took over . \nSo the president is out and his vice president is out . \nAnd it would be the military command . \nAnd I was told that they will , as soon as possible , reach out to the -- to wide sector of the Egyptian society -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- . \nAnd I hope that will happen as soon as possible because the army is there to help the country through the transition , to ensure stability during this period . \nBut we need to go back to law and order , to the economy start to function . \nWe need to go back from a country that was going down the drain to a country that is looking to the future . \nCOOPER : For the -- originally you had wanted a three-member commission of sort of technocrats running the country in order to transition ultimately to a place where you get free and fair elections . \nBecause Mubarak has eliminated and systemically wiped out so many democratic institutions in the country , there really are not many democratic institutions . \nHow long a period of time do you think Egypt needs before you can have free and fair elections ? \nELBARADEI : Well , I 'd like -- I 'd like to see a year . \nA period of a year . \nI think that 's what we need at least to help get started , established . \nGet people to get engaged . \nWe have to start from scratch and to my mind I think we need a year . \nWe need a presidential -LRB- ph -RRB- council where we could have one military person sharing power with two civilians . \nWe need a government of national unity and we need to build all the institutions necessary . \nSo we do n't need to rush . \nWe need to make clear that , as you 've said , that we will not be -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- , you know , after what we have gone through and we have learned from the experience of everybody else . \nI just got the call from George Papandreou , who was telling me that Greece went through the same process and he would like to brief me on the difficulties of going from a dictatorship into democracy . \nAnd so I got people from the states , you know , Washington administration , telling us that they are ready to help the Egyptian people in every way they can . \nSo the good will is there . \nWe just need to make it on our own and we need to take the time to do it right this time . \nCOOPER : There are some in the crowd who are still calling for Mubarak to be put on trial in some way . \nIs that something you would want to see ? \nELBARADEI : I do n't want to see that right now , frankly . \nI mean the country needs to be united , to work towards a future . \nI mean we have so many challenges ahead of us and we would like to make sure that , you know , we need to build our economy . \nWe need to have a socially cohesive society . \nWe need to have -- build democratic institutions . \nI think we need to , you know , we need to , you know , not to worry about retribution at this stage . \nAnd I think as far as Mubarak personally is concerned , he should leave in dignity . \nI think that 's what -- I know the Egyptians are angry . \nI know the Egyptians are feeling , you know , terrible about all the killing and the torture and -- but at least Mubarak needs to go and we need to look forward . \nAt least that 's what I think and I hope that would -- I would tell people , let 's focus on the future . \nLet 's have a process of reconciliation at this stage . \nWhat we need is reconciliation between -- and a country at peace with itself . \nGORANI : I have a quick question . \nDo you trust the -- Mohamed ElBaradei , this is Hala Gorani at the CNN Center . \nELBARADEI : Hi , Hala . \nDo you trust the military for a full year ? \nI mean do you trust the military as an institution to usher the country sort of into a brand-new era of true democracy for Egypt ? \nDo you think that they will be able to do that as an institution ? \nELBARADEI : Well , Hala , I think , you know , we needed them and I tweeted this morning , in fact , asking for the intervention because the country was really going into a period of violence . \nI was afraid of a bloodbath here when people thought that Mubarak was going to resign yesterday and then he reversed his decision at the last minute and continued to hang on to power . \nSo there was a lot of anger , a lot of frustration in the street . \nAnd it was the right thing for the army to come . \nBut the army , I think , heard the Egyptian people . \nThey do not want to replace Mubarak by a military coup . \nThat 's not a gain in the cause . \nAnd the writing was on the wall . \nWe need to be liberated . \nWe need to be democratic . \nWe need social justice . \nAnd what I understand , Hala , that the army is going to reach out as soon as possible to a wide sector of the Egyptian society as possible . \nI 'd like that -- to see that started tomorrow so we can have a sharing of power , the civilian and the military , and tell them what our demands are , what they need to do . \nWe do n't have the experience of running the country , but we need it for ensuring any stability -- stability during this period of turbulence we are going through . \nWe need to make sure that the economy is started -- running again . \nWe need to make sure that tourists will come . \nLaw and order , you have heard about -- you know , Anderson got beaten here . \nYou know , it -- and many others . \nIt has been terrible for a few weeks . \nSo we have a lot of work on our hands and I hope the army will understand that we put our trust in them , but they need to -- they need to , you know , to live up to our expectation . \nBLITZER : Well , can I just ask one question to Mohamed ElBaradei before I let him go . \nThis is Wolf Blitzer in Washington . \nI 'm getting a lot of e-mails and tweets from Egyptians saying what about the money Mubarak may have -- may be worth , what $ 20 billion -- as much as $ 70 billion . \nThey want the money . \nIs that something that people should press for right now , Ambassador ? \nELBARADEI : Wolf , absolutely . \nI mean I think -- I think this is money that they owe to Egypt . \nI think the first thing -- I mean if we are not going for trial , but definitely we are going for the money . \nThis is the money that owed -- that they owe to the Egyptian people . \nAnd as soon as I see , you know , people from the army , I think that is going to be one of the priorities . \nBut we have to frozen -LRB- ph -RRB- all their assets outside . \nI mean this is dictatorship . \nYou know , we have suffered for 30 years and they have gotten -- got away with murder . \nBut at least the money that we need here for development should come back to the Egyptian people . \nIt 's the money that the Egyptian people , Wolf . \nBLITZER : And finally , President Obama is getting ready to address the nation in about a half an hour or so from the White House . \nGive me one point you really want to hear him make . \nELBARADEI : I want to hear him loud and clear that he is with the Egyptian people , that he make a commitment that they will never support an authoritarian system in Egypt any -- under any circumstances . \nThat they will put all their -- whatever they can under the disposal of the Egyptian people . \nI heard that already from Washington , but I would like to hear President Obama say that publicly . \nI think the Egyptian people need to restore confidence that Americans , the U.S. , means what they say when they talk about democracy , rule of law . \nAnd as you know , it has been , you know , they have been walking very tightrope . \nThe rope finally has been broken and we need to hear loud and clear that the Egyptian administration -- that the American administration , that the American people are all with us on our march towards democracy , freedom and justice . \nBLITZER : Mohamed ElBaradei , thanks very much . \nCongratulation to all the Egyptian people on this historic day . \nWe will stay in obvious close touch with you , as well . \nWe appreciate what you told us . \nELBARADEI : Thank you very much , all of you . \nGORANI : Well , we have reaction from around the world . \nIran , the UAE , Germany , all reacting to what 's going on inside of Egypt today because of its importance in the region and its importance as setting an example to the rest of the Arab world . \nBut today is a day to take in the atmosphere in Tahrir Square , that epicenter of the pro- democracy movement , and Arwa Damon is there among the crowd . \nArwa , has the sort of atmosphere kind of gone down a notch or are people still in full party mood around you ? \nDAMON -LRB- via telephone -RRB- : Hala , the party here is definitely still going on . \nThere 's live music on stage . \nThe atmosphere is truly electric . \nI 'm surrounded by a young group of friends . \nThey 've been out here demonstrating day in and day out . \nAnd I 'm going to ask this to one of them , Homas -LRB- ph -RRB- . \nWhat are you feeling right now ? \nWe just got our liberty . \nPeople here are so happy really . \nDAMON : And what is going to happen tomorrow ? \nBut it took -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- . \nWe are just -LRB- ph -RRB- proud to be Egyptians . \nDAMON : Hala , this crowd out here , as we just heard from Mohamed , yes , they have lost a lot , the country has sacrificed a lot to make this happen , but these demonstrators have also achieved what was truly unthinkable three weeks ago , that President Hosni Mubarak would no longer be the ruler of Egypt . \nAnd to think that all of this was started by a call to demonstrate on the Internet , on FaceBook and at Twitter , people right now relishing the fact that they are at the forefront of history . \nNot just making history in Egypt , Hala , but as we know so well , history across the entire region . \nGORANI : Let 's take a look at some of these scenes . \nAnd I saw one young man there holding up a sign that read FaceBook there , that he 'd scribbled FaceBook there on his sign . \nAnd Wael Ghonim , the activist whose FaceBook page served as a virtual meeting point for these activists , said he wanted to meet Mark Zuckerberg . \nThat that was one of his goals in life . \nI 'm sure he might be getting a phone call . \nLet 's take a look at these pictures . \nThe tent city in Tahrir Square on your screens now . \nAnd ordinary Egyptians waving flags . \nA day of national pride for those who say they were not going to give up until President Mubarak stepped down . \nAnd this day has come for them . \nAnd there we see Arwa . \nArwa , can you still hear me ? \nDAMON : Yes , I can hear you . \nGORANI : Tell me , who 's around you right now ? \nWho are the people around you ? \nSort of by and large , are they young , are they old , are they families ? \nWho 's come out tonight ?

Pollack is a senior fellow in foreign policy studies and the director of the Saban Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution . \nHe is the author of numerous books on the Middle East , including A Path Out of the Desert : A Grand Strategy for America in the Middle East -LRB- Random House , 2008 -RRB- . \n-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Egyptians deserve their time to celebrate . \nHosni Mubarak 's resignation is a dramatic victory for the protest movement born so suddenly on January 25 . \nAs recently as a few weeks ago , few Egyptians -- if any -- could conceive of such a thing . \nAs Americans , we should only bask in their reflected joy and allow them this moment to revel in what they have accomplished . \nBut the celebration can not go on for too long because there is still much to be done if they are to realize their dreams of a prosperous , modern , democratic Egypt . \nMubarak 's exit can not be seen as the ultimate triumph of Egypt 's pro-democracy protest movement , although it is an important victory on the way . \nEgypt 's problems began before Mubarak , and they will not end with his ouster . \nInstead , they are the product of a corrupt , stagnant and oppressive system which Mubarak helped to build but now extends beyond his own person . \nAnd large elements of that system remain in place . \nThe Egyptian military , particularly its senior officers and intelligence leadership , have been critical pillars of that system , and neither we nor the Egyptian people know whether they are ready to accept the far more important and expansive demands for democratization , rule of law and economic reform that the protesters -LRB- and so many Egyptians -RRB- desire . \nGhonim : ` I 'm proud to be Egyptian today ' This is particularly critical since it is the military itself which must continue to play the vital role of holding the nation together , preventing a descent into chaos , fending off more radical elements that seek to hijack the revolution and overseeing a peaceful transition to democracy . \nWhat 's more it is a process that will take years to get right , no matter how soon it starts , and the Army will have to remain patient with the trials of a new democracy throughout . \nWhile many -LRB- myself included -RRB- point to Turkey as a rough model , we should all remember that the Turkish military lost patience with democracy too many times in the past during its long transition . \nThere is another danger lurking , namely that conservative elements within the regime may believe that sacrificing Mubarak will allow them to avoid the wider reforms that the protesters seek . \nThey may well assume that they can make Mubarak their scapegoat , and that the ferocity he has stirred in so many Egyptian souls will be expiated by his departure . \nThey may believe that his resignation will sate the anger of most Egyptians , who will then lose their interest in the protests and go back to their jobs and their lives , effectively taking the wind out of the sails of the protest movement , and marginalizing the hard core that remain . \nAfter all , those who oppose the protesters have been playing for time ever since their half-baked effort to crush the protests failed . \nThey doubtlessly believe that the protesters and opposition leaders , such as they are , can more easily be dealt with if they have lost the leverage of labor strikes , million-strong marches and the international media attention they bring . \nCertainly the strategy of this regime in years past has been to promise modest reforms in times of stress and then to simply fail to deliver when passions cooled and external pressure moved on . \nNo one should assume that Mubarak 's resignation will mean the end of opposition from the vestiges of Mubarak 's regime . \nThe regime can endure , and those who benefited most from it may well plan to fight on without him . \nThus , the real challenge for the protest movement still lies ahead . \nCan they maintain popular backing to force the regime to make key concessions on the nature of governance in Egypt , like ending the national emergency laws , establishing a committee to revise the constitution manned by respected opposition leaders , limiting the regime 's authority over civil liberties and enacting far-reaching legislation until a new president and parliament can be elected under a new constitution ? \nIf they can not maintain popular support in the form of continuing demonstrations until they can secure those or other similarly meaningful curbs on the regime 's powers , they run a very significant risk of failure . \nMubarak 's fall is a great triumph for the Egyptian people , and they have earned their right to celebrate . \nBut it does not signal `` mission accomplished . '' \nIt can not be the end of their struggles , for if it is , it will also be the end of their dreams . \nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kenneth Pollack . \n"}

'' \nAs Suleiman spoke , deafening cheers erupted among tens of thousands of Egyptians who thronged the streets of Cairo . \nIt was a moment they had sought throughout long , often tense days of demonstrations -- some of them violent -- that demanded Mubarak 's departure . \nIt was a moment that many in the Arab world 's powerhouse nation had not dared contemplate . \nChants of `` Egypt is free ! '' \nand `` God is great ! '' \nrose from the crowds , dizzy in the honeymoon of their success . \nSome waved Egyptian flags ; others honked horns ; still others set off fireworks as they savored the scene . \nTwo major bridges over the Nile River resembled congested parking lots , and partiers packed streets throughout Cairo . \nThe state-run Middle East News Agency said some people had passed out from joy and others had suffered heart attacks . \n`` It was a sense of liberation for me , for every Egyptian , '' said opposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei . \n`` For the first time , Egypt has a chance to be democratic , to be free , to have a sense of dignity , of freedom . \nSo it 's amazing . \nIt 's just like something we never experienced in our lifetime . '' \nA source with close connections to Persian Gulf government leaders said Mubarak , 82 , had fled to the Red Sea resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh , his presidency finished as abruptly as it had started in 1981 , when he ascended to power after the assassination of Anwar Sadat . \nThe repercussions echoed far beyond Tahrir Square as the Swiss government moved Friday to freeze assets belonging to Mubarak and his family , said Norbert Baerlocher , a spokesman for the Swiss Embassy in Washington . \nIn a speech to the nation Thursday night , Mubarak had indicated that he was delegating authority to Suleiman but made no mention of resigning . \nDisappointed crowds calling for his ouster grew in number Friday in Cairo and in other major cities . \nBy Friday night , the protesters got what they were seeking . \n"}

'' \nThe drama that unfolded in recent weeks had been simmering for some time . \nA Facebook page called `` We Are All Khaled Said '' -- named after a 28-year-old Egyptian businessman from Alexandria who was beaten to death by police last June -- sprung up , calling for protests on January 25 . \nWord spread on the streets of Cairo that there would be demonstrations . \nNo one knew exactly what to expect . \nAs many as 20,000 protesters spilled into the streets in an unprecedented display of anti-government rage that first day . \nAt one point , cheering protesters in the world 's largest Arab nation broke through riot police who had lined Tahrir , or Liberation , Square . \nPolice lobbed tear gas and used water cannons . \nIn fact , they became more galvanized . \nEven as the internet , text messages and phone services were shut down by the government in the days ahead , the people refused to be silenced -- although many were : Human Rights Watch estimated that more than 300 people have been killed since the protests began . \nAnd the man behind the Facebook page -- Wael Ghonim -- would emerge as a national inspiration after he was detained by authorities three days after the protests began . \n`` I want to say to every mother and every father that lost his child , I am sorry but this is not our fault , '' Ghonim said in a tearful message after his release this week . \n`` I swear to God , this is not our fault . \nIt is the fault of everyone who is holding on to power .

'' \nIranian leaders praised the Egyptian and Tunisian uprisings and said they were reminiscent of the 1979 Iranian revolution that toppled the shah of Iran and ushered in a hard-line and theocratic Islamic republic . \nBut Iranian authorities have blocked reformist websites and detained several opposition supporters and activists , opposition website Saham News reported Thursday . \nThis comes just days after two leading opposition figures called for a rally on February 14 in support of the uprisings in North Africa and the Middle East . \nIranian authorities on Wednesday warned against any attempt by the opposition movement to hold the rally , according to the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency . \nOpposition leaders and former presidential candidates Mir Hossein Moussavi and Mehdi Karrubi requested permission to hold the rally earlier this week , according to Saham News , Karrubi 's website . \nIt was unclear whether the government has denied the request . \nMoussavi and Karrubi asked that the rally take place in Tehran 's Azadi Square , the site of mass protests by Iran 's opposition movement after the disputed 2009 presidential elections . \nFor nearly eight months , supporters of Iran 's so-called Green Movement chose major calendar days to protest in cities throughout the country . \nMany of the movement 's grievances were identical to those now being expressed in the streets of Cairo . \nProtesters condemned what they called an oppressive regime , demanded political and social freedom and called for a more representative government . \nIran eventually quelled the demonstrations with a brutal crackdown against the peaceful street protests and the arrests of hundreds of activists , reformists and opposition figures , some of whom remain behind bars . \nSince the unrest , Iranian authorities have rejected all requests by Iran 's opposition movement for peaceful demonstrations . \n"}

'' \nMajor clashes between the people and the army , which Egyptians traditionally believe has been on their side , would be devastating , said ElBaradei , a Nobel Peace Prize winner and former director of the International Atomic Energy Agency . \nHosni Mubarak : I am not leaving Egypt Official : Mubarak to yield power to VP ElBaradei 's outlook had changed since hours before , when Egyptians , including thousands packed in Cairo 's Tahrir Square , expected Mubarak to step down rather than delegate powers to Vice President Omar Suleiman . \nThe arrangement failed to mollify opposition leaders or those who have rallied in Tahrir Square for more than two weeks . \nAnother mass protest is planned again Friday after prayer services . \n`` Mubarak is only one part of this regime , '' human rights activist Gigi Ibrahim , one of the Tahrir Square protesters , told CNN . \n`` People have been here for 17 days , and they are not for Suleiman , either , '' Ibrahim said . \n`` Mubarak has lost all legitimacy , and now him handing over the power to the vice president is as illegitimate as Mubarak being in power . '' \nElBaradei told CNN that Egyptians will not accept the new arrangement . \n`` Suleiman is considered to be an extension of Mubarak . \nNeither of them is acceptable to the people , '' he said . \n`` For the sake of their country , they should go . '' \nElBaradei said a leadership council and a caretaker government should rule the North African nation for one year during a transition to a more democratic process . \nMubarak 's defiant remarks about foreign intervention , and his determination to see the transition through , was not what most in the Tahrir Square crowd wanted to hear . \nmany chanted as he spoke . \nAfter the speech , parliamentary speaker Ahmed Fathi Srour told state-run Nile TV that Mubarak 's move had put the authority for the day-to-day running of the government in Suleiman 's hands . \nThe vice president referred to the past two weeks as the `` revolution of the young people . '' \nSuleiman told the protesters to go home and back to work . \nThat had not happened by early Friday . \nGallery : Protesters take to the streets in Egypt Hosni Mubarak : In his words Yaser Fathi , one of the organizers of a post-speech protest in the northern city of Alexandria , told CNN hundreds of demonstrators marched to an Egyptian military base . \nThey asked the armed forces to intervene and shouted that `` the military must step in to get Mubarak out , '' Fathi said . \nKhalid Abdalla , a demonstrator in Tahrir Square and star of the motion picture `` The Kite Runner , '' said early Friday that it 's `` an incredibly sad moment right now . '' \n`` Everyone 's lost , '' the actor said . \n`` People are trying to work out what more they can do . '' \nEgyptian journalist , writer and blogger Ethar El-Katatney , appearing on CNN 's `` Parker Spitzer '' Thursday night , likened Mubarak 's speech to American television 's `` Father Knows Best . '' \nHis earlier speech announcing he would step down in September had gained him some empathy , she said . \nEl-Katatney said she was worried that Friday could be `` bloody '' because of the people 's frustration . \nNobel laureate Ahmed Zewail , a potential Egyptian presidential candidate , said he sees `` several different scenarios '' through which a transition could take place . \n`` The important thing is that the army will protect this transition until a new Constitution is in place , '' Zewail told CNN before the Mubarak speech . \n`` I am very much appreciative of the fact that armed forces are controlling what 's going on . '' \nFreed cyberactivist Wael Ghonim , who emerged as a reluctant hero of Egypt 's uprising , had seemed pleased with just the prospect of Mubarak leaving office . \nHe is on leave from his marketing job with the search engine Google in Dubai and was held for 10 days during the protests . \n`` Revolution 2.0 : Mission Accomplished , '' Ghonim wrote on his Twitter account earlier Thursday , before Mubarak 's speech . \nCNN 's Ivan Watson , Saad Abedine and Arwa Damon contributed to this report . \n"}
{"id": "171", "time": "2011-02-11", "text": "By Cynthia P. Schneider and Nadia Oweidat , Special to CNN Anti-government protesters walk in Tahrir Square during a candlelight vigil for those killed during the uprising . \nCo-authors : Washington paid little heed to rising level of anger in Egypt They say American support for President Hosni Mubarak regime was a mistake Now U.S. has to choose between regime and protesters , they say Authors : Standing on side of the protesters would affirm U.S. ideal of freedom Editor 's note : Cynthia P. Schneider , a former U.S. ambassador to the Netherlands , is a distinguished professor at Georgetown University , a senior non-resident fellow at the Brookings Institution , and co-director of the MOST Resource Center , which provides information about Muslims to the American film and television industry . \nNadia Oweidat is a Ph. . \nD student at Oxford University and a former research associate at the RAND Corp. -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The only surprise about the Egyptian revolution is that it took so long . \nDemonstrations have been increasing in the past few years , despite the brutality of the regime , and with them deep distrust and hatred for President Hosni Mubarak and his government . \nThe Egyptian regime , as well as Washington , underestimated the impact of events such as the murder of the young businessman Khaled Sa'id , who was pulled out of a caf in Alexandria in June 2010 , beaten by the police , and then left dead on the street . \nIf they had visited the Arabic Facebook page started by Wael Ghonim , `` We Are All Kaled Sa'id , '' they might have realized that it was only a matter of when , and not if , the uprising would begin . \nThe profound discontent , frustration and humiliation of the Egyptian people also resonates in recent literature and films , such as `` The Yacoubian Building '' by Alaa al Aswany . \nChronicling the corruption , unemployment and poverty that plagues Egyptian society , the film was a candidate for an Academy Award in 2008 . \nFor years blogs -- in English and in Arabic -- have decried the abuses of the government , and the hopelessness of life in Egypt for even well educated youth . \nOn a trip to Egypt last summer , we were shocked by the potency of hatred for the Egyptian president . \nOn a trip to Egypt last summer , we were shocked by the potency of hatred for the Egyptian president . \nAfter cussing Mubarak throughout the ride , a taxi driver broke into tears saying that his children had not eaten any meat for months . \nThat he was willing to run the risks inherent in openly criticizing the president shows how desperately he felt . \nNow , thanks to the youth who incited the protests , `` the jewel of the Middle East , '' has been unleashed after years of suppression under Mubarak . \n`` We 'd rather die with pride than live without it '' proclaims a poster in Tahrir Square . \nBut through the prism of government and politics , Egypt looked stable -- if repressive . \nInternationally , it has continued for the past thirty years as a force for peace in the Middle East and a buffer for Israel . \nThese priorities , and the misguided belief that supporting Mubarak 's harsh regime represented America 's security interests , appear to be guiding the U.S. response to the protests . \nWill the United States end up on the right side of history ? \nBlindsided by the onset of the revolution , Washington continues to underestimate the intelligence of the Egyptian people , their resolve to end tyranny , and their determination to accept nothing less than democracy . \nTo that end , the protesters have endured more than two weeks of regime brutality , hundreds of deaths at the hands of pro-Mubarak snipers and police -LRB- our sources in Egypt estimate at least 500 deaths , but the precise number can not be determined because hospitals are forbidden to give out names of the wounded and dead -RRB- , as well as severely limited food and medical supplies . \nPresident Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have attempted to walk a tightrope of supporting the democratic aspirations of the protesters and criticizing the regime 's violent tactics , while also calling for `` stability '' and a `` gradual transition . '' \nTheir mixed messages , calling for Mubarak to `` leave now '' and then backing his close confidant and former head of Intelligence Omar Suleiman to lead the transition , reflect the challenging complexity of the situation , but also they have caused confusion and disappointment for those on the ground in Egypt and their supporters around the world . \nAmerican authorities further impair their credibility when they refer to the `` negotiations '' with Suleiman . \nThese `` talks with the opposition '' have no legitimacy with the millions of protesters who are following the young leaders . \nNeither Mohammed El Baradei nor the youth leaders have participated . \nIndeed , the leaders of the revolution have declared repeatedly that they will not negotiate until Mubarak leaves , and , even then , not with members of his regime . \nThe Muslim Brotherhood , who did participate in the talks initially encouraged by the U.S. , has been widely discredited among the protesters for speaking to Suleiman . \nIn between fielding calls from American officials , Suleiman and Prime Minister Ahmed Shafiq have been appearing on Egyptian State TV to discredit the protesters , insisting they represent `` foreign interests '' identified variously as American intelligence , Israel , and Hamas -LRB- an odd combination made even odder because Hamas has not permitted demonstrations against Mubarak , at least until recent days -RRB- . \nThis tactic has backfired . \nThe proud and nationalistic Egyptians have been incensed by this accusation from a regime that has increased its own riches while dragging the country into poverty . \nIn his moving interview after having been released from prison , the emerging leader Wael Ghonim stated tearfully that what hurt him the most was being accused in prison of being paid by foreigners to protest . \nAs a Google executive living in comfort in Dubai , Ghonim did not need money ; but rather , he freely chose to travel to Egypt to participate in the demonstrations . \n`` How dare anyone doubt my love for Egypt ? '' \nAn Arabic Facebook page entitled , `` I delegate Wael to lead on my behalf '' has already accumulated almost 300,000 `` likes , '' and the number is increasing by the minute . \nWill the United States end up on the right side of history ? \nNo one can deny that history is being made in Egypt , nor can anyone predict how this uprising of rich and poor , Muslim and Christian , will end . \nWhile many maintain that the United States must choose between its security interests -- stability in Egypt and the region and its ideals of freedom , democracy , and self-determination called for by the protesters -- we think this is a false dichotomy . \nIt is in the United States ' long-term security interest to align itself firmly and unequivocally with the protesters . \nIt is time to `` walk the walk '' of Obama 's Cairo speech of June 2009 : `` All people yearn for certain things : the ability to speak your mind and have a say in how you are governed ; confidence in the rule of law and the equal administration of justice ; government that is transparent and does n't steal from the people ; the freedom to live as you choose . \nThose are not just American ideas , they are human rights , and that is why we will support them everywhere . '' \nThe cost of not redeeming the promise of Obama 's stirring words will be every bit as high as the risk of uncertainty of the future of the people 's revolution in Egypt . \nThe United States surely will not determine the outcome of the January 25 uprising . \nBut if America is standing on the sidelines , anxious about upsetting other dictator allies , and not firmly backing the voices of freedom and self-determination , it will have lost its credibility , and its `` soft power '' to persuade and influence . \nThere will be no more Cairo speeches ; no one will listen . \nNo one is better equipped than the United States to assist the new Egypt in building democratic institutions , but will the protest leaders turn to the government that backed Omar Suleiman as the transition leader ? \nIt is time to change the script , and to act on behalf of the United States ' true security interests by supporting human rights in Egypt , and the brave Egyptians fighting for them . \nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the co-authors . \n"}

'' \nFor some of the young Egyptians living abroad , the change in leadership has renewed hopes that one day they will be able move back to a country with renewed opportunities . \nStudent Mohamed Ibrahim , 22 , left Egypt three years ago . \nHe told CNN : `` Under Mubarak the main hopes for the young people were to travel abroad , leave and get a decent job outside of Egypt . \nBut now , from this moment , from this day , things will be different . '' \nBut for most , this was not a day to speculate on the future . \nThis was a day of celebration . \nCollege lecturer Khairy Eteiwy , 34 , summed up the mood : `` Tonight we have made history . \n`` We can now tell our children that we were here , we contributed , we 've done something amazing and that 's never happened before .

'' \nIt would take a dramatic turn of events for Mubarak to leave office , according to Kurtzer . \n`` I believe the only thing that will change Mubarak 's mind is a sit down with top military and security leaders who basically say to him , ` Your presence is putting the system in jeopardy .

'' \nBecause the Florida judge ruled that the individual mandate , the part of the law that says everyone has to buy health insurance , is unconstitutional , he says the whole law has to go out the window , Toobin said . \nToobin said it is important to note that several federal judges have found the law constitutional . \n`` This is why we have a United States Supreme Court , to settle when judges disagree with each other , '' Toobin said . \nThe nine justices `` have the last word , '' Toobin said . \n`` Nobody can tell them what to do or when to do it . '' \n-LRB- Updated at 5:37 p.m. -RRB- The U.S. Department of Justice says it plans to appeal the ruling of a federal judge in Florida , who earlier today struck down as unconstitutional key parts of the sweeping health care reform bill championed by President Obama . \n-LRB- Updated at 3:47 p.m. -RRB- A federal judge in Florida has ruled unconstitutional the sweeping health care reform law championed by President Barack Obama , setting up what is likely to be a contentious Supreme Court challenge in coming months over the legislation . \nMonday 's ruling came in the most closely watched of the two dozen challenges to the law . \nFlorida along with 25 states had filed a lawsuit last spring , seeking to dismiss a law critics had labeled `` Obamacare . '' \nJudge Roger Vinson , in a 78-page ruling , dismissed the key provision of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act - the so-called `` individual mandate '' requiring most Americans to purchase health insurance by 2014 or face `` I must reluctantly conclude that Congress exceeded the bounds of its authority in passing the Act with the individual mandate . \nThat is not to say , of course , that Congress is without power to address the problems and Inequities in our health care system , '' Vinson wrote . \n`` Because the individual mandate is unconstitutional and not severable , the entire Act must be declared void . \nThis has been a difficult decision to reach , and I am aware that it will have indeterminable implications . \nAt a time when there is virtually unanimous agreement that health care reform is needed in this country , it is hard to invalidate and strike down a statute titled ` The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act . ' '' \nOn the heels of anti-government demonstrations in Tunisia , thousands of protesters spilled into the streets of Egypt in a rare display of anti-government outcry . \nCNN reporters on the scene witnessed throngs of people in Cairo march from Tahrir Square to the parliament building . \nDemonstrators threw rocks at police , who threw them back and shot tear gas at the protesters , who also reciprocated . \nWhile Egypt estimated that there were 5,000 to 10,000 protesters , CNN estimated that the demonstration peaked at 15,000 to 20,000 protesters . \nThe protest 's organizers said they wanted to mirror the uprising in Tunisia , which 10 days prior had precipitated the end of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali 's 23-year rule . \nBefore the protests in Cairo , several Egyptians set themselves or tried to set themselves on fire earlier in the month , which also was reminiscent of Tunisia , where a man 's self-immolation spurred the uprising . \nThe Egyptian protesters - who included young and old , Christians and Muslims , students , workers and businesspeople - said they were angry over the cost of living , failed economic policies and corruption . \nThey demanded that President Hosni Mubarak , in power for three decades , follow the lead of Tunisia 's president . \n`` We breathe corruption in the air , '' said one demonstrator . \nTens of millions of people are

anti-gay slurs and sailors pretending to shower with each other aboard ship . \nIn early January , Honors was removed from his post commanding the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise . \nAn official 15-page statement that Honors gave to Navy investigators states that two commanding officers , two strike group admirals `` and myriad other senior military and civilian distinguished visitors '' were aware of the videos , according to the Navy Times . \nHonors made the videos in 2006 and 2007 when he was executive officer of the Enterprise , and they were discussed during meetings with the ship 's commanding officer and other leadership , the Navy Times reports . \nDuring these conversations , Honors received encouraging feedback about the content of the movies and was never told to stop making them , according to the report . \nHonors ' superiors did not respond to Navy Times ' requests for comment . \nA strong cyclone thrashed flood-ravaged Queensland , Australia , this week , but another

{"id": "36", "time": "2011-01-31", "text": "With Egyptian protesters hitting the streets for a week now , there is a growing sense of frustration at the lack of response from the U.S. Protestors hold an anti Hosni Mubarek sign in Tahrir Square during afternoon anti-government protests today in Cairo . \nMany point to the speech President Obama made to the Muslim world in Cairo in June 2009 . \nIn it , he spoke about Democracy and warned that governments ca n't suppress the rights of the people . \nSo ... almost two years later - these protesters want to know why President Obama is n't putting his money where his mouth is - and openly supporting them . \nSome in the Middle East are going even farther . \nThe Israeli newspaper Ha-aretz writes that Mr. Obama will be remembered as the president who `` lost '' Egypt , `` and during whose tenure America 's alliances in the Middle East crumbled . '' \nThe piece suggests President Obama has been too cautious - sitting on the fence and neither embracing despised leaders nor preaching for Democracy . \nBut supporters of the administration say that abandoning a key ally in a time of crisis would damage America 's interests in the region . \nWhat kind of message would it send to other allies ? \nAlso , others see Egypt as a moderate force in a region of Islamic extremists like Iran . \nThey say Egypt has helped keep peace between Israel and the Arab world . \nMeanwhile , there are signs that after 30 years , the White House is quietly preparing for a post-Mubarak Egypt . \nOne former Obama official tells the Los Angeles Times that the administration recognizes it has to be `` on the right side of history , '' and that it ca n't try to keep Mubarak in power at all costs . \nHere s my question to you : What is the U.S. role when it comes to violence and political unrest in the Middle East ? \nInterested to know which ones made it on air ? \nThere has always been conflict in the Mideast and we will continue to be affected by it as long as we are so dependent on their oil . \nOur sputnik moment should be making a car that can run on anything but oil . \nJust think of the peace we could have if we were n't always trying to pacify some oil-rich dictator . \nTo stay out of their business . \nWe have spent billions upon billions of dollars on corrupt governments all over the globe , and for what ? \nThe people of these countries know nothing of our generosity , do n't care about it and end up hating us regardless . \nThe U.S. should be very careful not to choose sides but support a more democratic government that gives the people more rights and freedom than they have now . \nThe U.S. has to walk a fine line when doing this . \nIt is like an outsider getting involved in a family argument . \nYou need to watch what you say and do or the whole family will turn against you . \nThe role of the U.S. in an unstable Middle East is to be `` on the right side of history '' ... These days , being on the right side means giving moral support to a downtrodden populace trying to oust a ruthless dictator , while giving the same dictator financial support to maintain a military for the purpose of putting down his enemies . \nA brilliant policy really , in its simplicity . \nBeing on both sides of history always guarantees you 'll come out on the right side . \nIt is long past time for us to stop sticking our noses in everyone else 's business . \nHow would we feel if another country interfered in our affairs ? \nPeter in Tarrytown , New York writes : It is time for the U.S. to fish or cut bait . \nEither we support democracy , civil and human rights and we oppose dictatorial countries or we do n't . \nWe have the opportunity now to back the citizens of Egypt or look like hypocrites . \nWhat do we stand for if we do n't support the citizenry of Egypt now ? \nMaybe if we had listened to the likes of Rep. Ron Paul , and at least considered a non-interventionist military foreign policy when it came to the role of the US anywhere in the world , we might or might not have been in the position of `` invading '' other countries . \nI am not not sure if I am a Paul supporter , I am just saying . \nWhen it comes to Egypt , we must look at our role in the past and see if it was necessary . \nIt 's funny because I am sitting in a Political Science class right now and we are discussing this very issue . \nHistorically , most of America s foreign policy is dictated by Wall Street , specifically what s in it for us ? \nIf a country has something we need , i.e. oil , gas , cheap labor , real estate for a military base , etc , then the U.S. is there with guns-a-blazin . \nBut if there is little or no financial pay off for our intervention , we just rationalize the unrest by stating it s a `` domestic dispute '' then do nothing aside from offering an obligatory million or two dollars in emergency aid six months down the road . \nIt is n't our affair , and we should not be meddling . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 2:03 pm | Jack : Good question , but no easy answers . \nThe Middle East will have to define itself and not the United States . \nWe will have to protect our friends , and hopifully make new friends down the road . \nIt is in the best interest of the United States ' National Security that Israel is protected from its enemies . \nPrayer and faith that all will turn out for the better in Egypt and the Middle East . \nTough question !!! January 31 , 2011 at 2:05 pm | make sure we do n't allow the suez canal to close . \nthat is probably the target anyway . \nIf that is lost we and all of Europe is a goner . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 2:11 pm | For me , the answer is very simple , we need to stay totally out of it , and any other countries problems . \nStop foreign aid to all countries , now , before we are in the same shape as they are . \nObama needs to stay here , in the good old U.S.A. and worry about whats going on right here . \nWe , the United States and are corrupt politicians need to stop trying to kiss every countries backside and stop being the police of the world just to gain favor , let some other countries help for a great change , do n't you think ? \nI really do n't understand how Obama or any of our corrupt politicians can give any advice to any country about what is the right or wrong thing to do , when they do n't have a clue as to how to fix our own problems . \nThe biggest joke of all was Janet Napolitano givng afghanistan advice on border security , what an idiot she is , give me a break . \nObam and Napolitano 's idea of border security is just turn your head and look the other way and let the invaders invade , what a joke the both of them are . \nWhat do you call 10 politicians jumping off a high cliff , a good start , that 's what ? \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 2:11 pm | Jack you guys just do n't get it . \nYou have no role of any kind in the middle east . \nYou are a customer for their oil and an easy money sorce . \nExcept for being an invading military force , that is where your role ends . \nThe second you tell them to do something they do n't want to do you will get told to go pound sand . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 2:13 pm | It is an internal matter , and we should be hands-off . \nWith the anti-American talk already swirling , the U.N not the U.S. needs to be the referee . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 2:33 pm | when is Washington going to understand that the U.S. role in the middle east should be limited to flying out Americans from trouble spots . \nEver since World War II our middle east policy has been totally dictated by two things , Israel and Oil . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 2:36 pm | It is long past time for us to stop sticking our noses in everyone else 's business . \nHow would we feel if another country interfered in our affairs ?? January 31 , 2011 at 2:37 pm | To me it should n't be anything at all but with the OIL situation we 'll try once again to buy peace to no avail . \nWe 'll just give them more money , which we have to borrow from China . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 2:38 pm | I think The United States needs to denounce any violence being used by either side . \nThe U.S. should be very careful not to choose sides but support a more democratic gov ' t that gives the people more rights and freedom than they have now . \nThe U.S. has to walk a fine line when doing this . \nIt is like an outsider getting involved in a family argument . \nYou need to watch what you say and do or the whole family will turn against you . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 2:38 pm | Personally , I think they have been acting wisely and diplomatically as a brilliant nation , and will succeed if they continue at the same pace . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 2:38 pm | To stay out of it ! \nAnd let the new freedom movement have it 's way . \nThese people want full employment and a democracy ! \nThey want to vote their leaders in , and have a job , what 's wrong with that ? \nThe Suez Canal is n't going to be shut down , that 's income and jobs for Egypt 's people . \nThis whole deal is about employment and what 's fair for all . \nWhile these people have `` their '' Revolution , Mubarak 's kid is toughing it out in Vienna ? \nLife is so tough for some ! \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 2:39 pm | Why would we have a role ? \nIt 's not our country and there is no invasion from some other country . \nIf this were happening in the USA do you think some other country is going to stick their nose in our affairs . \nNo they are not . \nWe need to simply watch the situation and keep our mouths shut . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 2:43 pm | untill we get our own house in order we should stay out of it . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 2:45 pm | It 's an internal matter that they need to figure out for themselves . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 2:45 pm | best option for United States is to keep our nose out of it BUT to let the Egyptian military know thru back channels that IF some radical Islamist group like the Muslim Brotherhood ends up in power , that will be the END of ANY American aid money or support for their country . \nI do n't think that they want to lose the 1.3 BILLION dollars of support that were give the Egyptian military every year . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 2:53 pm | I believe that the United States mst not be involved involved with the internal struggles of other countries . \nPresident Woodrow Wilson made this mistake by sending 100,000 US troops to Russia to adid in the counter-revolution against the Communists in 1919 . \nthis led to the Cold War . \nWhat happened in Russia was a civil war . \nWe had no business being there . \nthe same is true in Egypt . \nWe should support the activities of UN Peacekeeping Troops who are trained to keep the peace . \nWe got involved in Bosnia , Kosovo and Viet-Nam and look where it got us . \nUnited States troops should not be involved in warlike actions unless it is a threat against our national security or is a clear and present danger . \nAs a Viet-Nam Veteran I am speaking on behalf of thousands of veterans who `` Do n't want to study war no more . '' \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 2:56 pm | What it is and what it should be are two entirely different things . \nIt is a role where we meddle in everyone s business messing things up everywhere , including here at home . \nWhat it should be is to mind our own business and take care of our own problems we have more than enough . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 2:57 pm | Pooh pooh the violence , and try to direct the political unrest so that the protesters understand that the United States is not their enemy . \nThe truth of the matter is that political unrest leads to a power vacuum which can be exploited by Islamic extremists , since they are usually the most tightly organized political organizations and which are willing to say anything to achieve power . \nWe can only hope for the best -LRB- but expect the worst , because that 's what 's happened in both Iran and Lebanon -RRB- . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 2:59 pm | U.S. - Egyptian relations are aimed at maintaining regional stability , improving bilateral relations , continuing military cooperation and sustaining the 1979 Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty . \nThe United States should remain neutral as Egypt has been it 's own democracy for over 20 years . \nOther then helping to get U.S. citizens out that want to leave the area through the U.S. Embassy efforts we need to do nothing . \nEgypt 's problems are their own and unless they ask for assistance from the west we need to stay the hell out of their business . \nAny interference from the United States would only appear like an oil grab . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 3:05 pm | We have enough headache , and enough problems jack ... we need to stay away and fix our economy ... stay focus on Manufacturing ... strengthening dollar , and stringent immigration ... o.k. . . \nwhat nonsense you guys speak ... middle east ... middle east ... are they pumping oil to America ? \nwe liberated Kuwait ... fought for Saudi what did they give ... look at oil , it is going up ... up ... and up ... we need to produce more fuel-efficient automobiles till we do public transportation ... o. k , Again , GM lobby or buy all Cleveland transportation , lobby to cars and oil dependency ... ??? wake up ... January 31 , 2011 at 3:09 pm | To sit off to the side and see what happens . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 3:27 pm | Emphatically , NONE ! \nGet American citizens out and that is it . \nFunny how we had such a problem with Iraq having a dictator but not with Egypt . \nOr how we are not encouraging the citizens to revolt against a government that will not hold elections . \nOur government refers to him as `` president '' , I do not think that is the opinion of the Egyptian citizens . \nPerhaps we should all be taking to Facebook and Twitter to remind our government that we do not want to police the world . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 3:30 pm | To try and keep the peace , at all times , during these times as well as peaceful times . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 3:30 pm | None ! \nWe need to get our own house in order before dictating to other governments . \nLet the Middle East take care of their problems and we can take care of our many , many problems in the mean time . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 3:32 pm | We ned to urge Mubarak to impement changes to benefit the general population . \nSince it is not clear who is the principal force behind the potsts or what thier objectives are , it hard to formulate any respose . \nThere is already signs of anger towards the U.S. by the people who want Pres. Mubarak out . \nWe do n't need to aggrevate it or get mired down in it . \nWe 've messed around in the Middle East too much too often . \nThe US should be pushing the United Nations to take more leadership in promoting modern , responsible government in these member countries . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 3:48 pm | The U.S role is clearly to protect , preserve and sustain U. S national security interest and economical interest . \nS also has an obligation to it 's strategic allies like Israel . \nIn addition , the U. S , as does the rest of the global community , has a role in ensuring that the middle east region is one that is conducive for the peaceful existence of all countries in the region . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 3:51 pm | There has always been conflict in the mideast and we will continue to be affected by it as long a we are so dependent on their oil . \nOur sputnik moment should be making a car that can run on anything but oil . \nJust think of the peace we could have if we were n't always trying to pacify some oil rich dictator . \nWe could actually speak with our convictions instead of our pocket books . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 3:58 pm | What difference does it make , Jack ? \nYou do n't care what people think . \nYou and your ideological media cronies tolerate different responses based on who occupies the White House . \nBecause the White House is currently occupied by one of your own , any response , no matter how incompetent , will the be correct one in your eyes , and you 'll look for creative ways to defend it . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 4:05 pm | We need to recognize that the voice of the people creates the allies of the future . \nBenito Juarez , a Mexican hero , used to say ` Respect for the rights of others , is peace . '' \nThe u.s. role is to concoct a million reasons for oil prices to skyrocket , not one ounce of oil has been slowed since the uprising , but the u.s. oil companies and brokerage firms will find a way to sqeeze that extra buck from american pockets . \nand our do-nothing president will stand by and pretend nothing has happened . \ntoo bad , I was his biggest fan . \nI thinks Egyptions are better off than americans . \nwe just think we are doing better . \nlou in clearwater January 31 , 2011 at 4:17 pm | Jack , our country 's history suggestion we have rarely been on the side of the main street people . \nThis is principally because we have never learned to appreciative the culturally history of our opponents and its impact on our Strategic interests . \nIt seems our strategic interests are being defined by international corporations . \nHence we loose every time . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 4:23 pm | Remo , from beautiful downtown Pflugerville Texas We should let the region decide for themselves . \nWestern Europe and the U.S. have meddled enough and we have the poor results to prove it . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 4:23 pm | The stage was set in 1776 . \nOpposing democracy and the rights of man is not an option . \nIt 's important to be who you are in this life , in this world . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 4:24 pm | The role of the U.S. is to promote political stability , human rights and democracy in Egypt and in the rest of middle east region . \nTo effectively accomplish this goal , the Obama Administration must support the cause of the Egyptian people and nudge Hosni Mubarak to leave his leadership post and Egypt . \nThe U.S. must foster democratic and economic reforms in Egypt . \nThis requires the U.S. to pull out all of the stops and use all tools of influence neccessary to accomplish this agenda -- i.e. diplomacy and\\/or stopping military aid to Egypt , imposing economic sanctions and encouraging U.N. sanctions . \nFurthermore , the U.S. can and should also broker , support and oversee free elections in Egypt after Mubarak 's departure . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 4:28 pm | Indeed , has been intteresting to watch the Obama ADM with their finger to the wind giong from supporting he Dictator to `` not knowing what to do '' . \nThe world looks at Obama ADM as weak and indeed that shows worldwide ... partly responsible for what has happened . \nReading history alot , I wonder what Reagan , Eishenhauer or Truman would of done ? \nwe can advise the people in these areas but we have to stay out these areas . \nthe people of these areas must chose their own destiny so they can feel that they decided their future . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 4:41 pm | The u.s. needs to stop borrowing money to give israel and egypt billions of dollars . \nIsrael and egypt have budget surpluses and we have deficits . \nWe have homelesness , poverty , foreclosures , expensive health care , expensive college tuition , high energy bills , 70 trillion dollars in unfunded liabilities , high credit card rates , high bank fees , dropping home values , two unnecessary wars , and 16,000 murders per year . \nOur entire budget is borrowed money which we get from banksters who we bailed out with taxpayer funds . \nWe continue to loan banks trillions of dollars at 0 % interest so they can gamble it away on wall street instead of investing in america . \nObama and congress are fiscally insane , and have absolutely no concept of budget reality . \nWhere is the stability in the middle east we were promised when we invaded iraq and afghanistan . \nIt is time for politicians to help main street , instead of helping corporations , banks , wall street and countries who do n't need our help . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 4:52 pm | What is the U.S. role when it comes to violence and political unrest in the Middle East ? \nWhy should the US have any role ? \nThe US should adopt the Muslim act of charity system . \n1st you take care of yourself 2nd you take care of your family 3rd you take care of your parents 4th you take care of your siblings 5th you take care of your neighbors 6th you take care of your community -LRB- town , city -RRB- 7th you take care of your nation 8th you take care of other nations If our nation would adopt this charity system we would be doing so much better . \nIf you have money after taking care of yourself then you can share it with other . \nWe do n't have the money to support Israel , Egypt , or any other nation . \nWe need to take care of us first ! \nThis is a tough one . \nWe claim we want to help the citizens of the Middle East establish democratic governments . \nWe support Egypt 's Mubarak who is a dictator but paid by the US at a cost of 1 billion 5 hundred million dollars a year so the US can count on him to support our support of Israel . \nThe Saudis have oil , lots of clean oil and allow us military bases in their country . \nGreat cooperation and compromises will be needed to get us through this point in our relationships in the Mid-East January 31 , 2011 at 4:57 pm | Cliff Glass - Rego Park , New York The only reasonable action that President Obama can take in Egypt is to declare that all military aid will be immediately converted into humanitarian assistance and distributed to the Egyptian people via international organizations , such as the United Nations or the Red Cross . \nAssisting the people and not military regimes is the best way to ensure Middle East stability . \nLet the food , water , generators , and blankets be stamped '' made in USA '' instead of the tear gas cannisters and rubber bullets . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 4:59 pm | Ron Paul said it best when he said '' The terrorist are over here because we , our C.I.A is over there . \nAs a country we have innocent blood on our hands . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:09 pm | Not to be flip Jack but maybe we should mind our own business unless it ' s clearly a security threat to the United States . \nI do n't mean we become isolationists . \nThat did not work in the 1930 's when we turned our backs on Europe and the rise of Adolph Hitler . \nBut I think we have spread ourselves way too thin with a presense in just about every part of the world . \nLet 's work on protecting our borders and making things again . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:11 pm | This is the unfortunate by-product of creating alliances with dictatorships . \nNow the President is caught between a rock and a hard place . \nWhat kind of message does it send to other regime 's we are allied with , such as Saudi Arabia , if we jump at an opportunity to overthrow their government ? \nWhat we should be doing is pressuring our existing allies to reform or cut ties , and only make future ties with democracies . \nWe ca n't continue to stand for one thing and support the opposite . \nNo wonder we look like hypocrites . \nWe must however keep Egypt form becoming another radical religous country , just like we must keep America from becoming a right wing only , all christian country . \nI am glad I am not the President . \nI could do a term in Congress as I have the ability to become an elite jerk overnite too . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:16 pm | The impact of social media is undeniable , but whether it 's for good or ill remains to be seen . \nAnd therein lies the rub : instant communication , without the `` leavening '' of evaluation and reflection , can bring instant progress ... or instant doom . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:21 pm | January 31 , 2011 at 5:22 pm | I know we do seem to think we are the police chiefs of the world and now countries are expecting us to continue on as if we are . \nBUT we are n't -- we need to MIND our own business ! \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:22 pm | The United States basically should not stick its nose to other country 's internal affairs . \nThe whole Middle East historically was ruled by Kings and monarchs . \nEgypt is an ally , but they should resolve their issue in accordance to what is right and best for them . \nTo take side and play a major role not only emboldens some , but it also brings fear and uncertainty to other allies in that part of the world . \nWe have so much problem of our own here , so stick to domestic affairs and leave them alone . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:22 pm | We get it , publicly no head of state wants to take a stand one way or the other . \nPrivately , I 'm sure they 're all saying Mubarik is on his way out . \nOnce upon a time we used to have leaders with real guts , now everyone is so concerned with appearance it 's like all the world 's leaders are stuck in a high school mentality . \nSmall wonder more and more people feel the need to take matters into their own hands . \nObama has , frankly , been a real disappointment in this situation and I voted for him . \nWhere 's the guy who spoke so passionately about the rights of people during his campaign ? \nThat has to apply to everyone , not just one country , or it means nothing . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:23 pm | Here s my question to you : What is the U.S. role when it comes to violence and political unrest in the Middle East ? \nUmm ... to cause more of it ? \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:23 pm | The U.S. needs to stress the grave concern over the Muslim Brotherhood . \nWe 've already seen Lebanon 's government collapse and Iran is waiting silently . \nIf Egypt does collapse , which it probably will once Mubarak resigns and the Muslim Brotherhood finds a way into Egypt 's new government , this means ALL radical terrorist groups could be one step closer on its ambition to whip Israel off the face of this planet . \nThat whole region of the world will become a war zone . \nWe need to mind our own business . \nTheir culture has completely different values and objectives than ours . \nWe learned nothing from Vietnam . \nWe ca n't continue to meddle in other countrys affairs and when were not successful in ramming democracy down their throats throw money at the failure . \nWashington needs a mental enema . \nI feel the U.S. should simply be promoting democracy . \nOffering resources and finances to help ensure the framework of a monitored national election this year . \nIt would bring organized opponents to the forefront with positions , ideas and mandates and help put some faces to the unrest . \nIt is the most effective method of ensuring real change in Egypt is reflective of the majority of its citizens and avoids leaving any political void . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:25 pm | You ca n't keep them down on the Farm , once they 've seen Paris January 31 , 2011 at 5:26 pm | President Obama Did Speak About Democracy In His Speech In Cairo , Egypt Back In 2009 But That Does n't Mean We Should Be In Support Of Removing Anyone From Power ! \nThe Obama Administration Is Handling This Situation The Best Way They Can , It Unethical To Just Send Troops Into The Country And Remove Someone From Power That Is n't Hurting Nobody ! \nI Think The Best Thing Anyone Can Do Concering This Issue Is To Offer Our Support And Try To Talk Peacefully And Find Ways Together To Fix What 's Broken ! \nPlease Mr , Obama do not put all your money in Mubarak , put all you ' r money in the Eygption people they the one wll stay in the end ... you have to act now before time is all over , they 're looking for a leader jump in and get it , Mubarak all gone it 's the time to act . \nwe going anyway if you do or not . \nTucson , AZ -- The US has no good role to play in these events -- remember , Egypt is not our country ! \nWe must have good relations with the governments , but we do not get to choose those governments , and can not , without hypocrisy , support despots in suppressing their own peoples . \nBy emulating England in overthrowing popular governments we did not `` like '' , we have made many enemies around the world , in places where we need to have friends . \nWe screwed this up in Iran -- lets not screw it up in Egypt too . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:30 pm | The U.S. on the `` right '' side of Middle Eastern history ? \nWhen has this ever happened ? \nThe problem for the U.S. with this particular Egyptian uprising is that Mubarak is not overtly tyrannical like others the U.S. has made it 's foreign policy very clear with . \nHe is , in fact , the worse kind of tyrant , a soft , hidden one depriving his highly educated population of a fair chance at social mobility . \nObama , step up , and support the Egyptian people , they are LITERALLY fighting for the words you spoke about in your recent State of the Union . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:35 pm | Jack , if America talks the talk of democracy , she must be willing to walk the walk as well . \nFor the past 30 yrs , with 2 Billion dollar taxpayers money annually , American Govt has supported the Dictatorial and Anti-democratic regime in Egypt , Is this a role we the American people should be proud of ? . \nOur true ally are the Egyptian people who are calling for an end to dictatorship and entrenchment of democracy , and it is their voice we must listen to . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:37 pm | The U.S. role in the middle east is simply anything the israeli lobby -LRB- AIPAC -RRB- tells us to do . \nFrom the orchestrated financial collapse around the world to the local school board appointments , every thing is being micro-managed to the benefit of the overlords . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:41 pm | Jack , the role the U.S. has is to speak softly and carry a big stick , same as it has for years . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:42 pm | I wish democracy , freedom , and justice for everyone but why is it that everyone point 's fingers at President Obama when another country has problems ? \nNot just Egypt who I am praying for but any country or nation . \nOur country has its own problems and we 're still working on that right now while making steady progress . \nBush made a mistake by interfering when we invaded Iraq to take over and look at how that ended . \nA lot of people expect the US to act as the big brother for other countries out there and take over . \nI understand that what other countries do can sometimes affect us but what they do is really none of our business to a certain extent . \nThis is between the people of Egypt and their government . \nObama is the President of the United States , not the World . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:46 pm | Unfortunately , the US always comes to the rescue , whether or not it 's appreciated . \nWe are damned if we do , and damned if we do n't . \nLogically , we really ca n't do any different than what we 've always done , and that is to help . \nObama has already developed a rapport with Mubarik . . \nthey are waiting for us to help . \nEithery way and as always , The US loses . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:48 pm | I know this one , Jack . \nThe role of the U.S. in an unstable Middle East is to be `` on the right side of history . '' \nEvery politico and pundit worth his or her sound bite says so . \nThese days , being on the right side means giving moral support to a down-trodden populace trying to oust a ruthless dictator , while giving the same dictator financial support to maintain a military for the purpose of putting down his enemies . \nA brilliant policy really , in its simplicity . \nBeing on both sides of history always guarantees you 'll come out on the right side . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:53 pm | It is time for the U.S. to fish or cut bait . \nEither we support democracy , civil and human rights and we oppose dictatorial countries or we do n't . \nWe have the opportunity now to back the citizens of Egypt or support the citizenry of Egypt now ? \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 6:01 pm | Pleaseavknowledge the ongoing talks between the Obama administration and Mubarak , which most likely are suggesting he leave the country . \nAt the same time , the Obama Administration is working with leading members of the opposition to assist in their rise to power . \nHe is serious in his assisting the oppressed . \nIn the end , our president will be embraced by the protestors , as well as most of the world . \nI would guess , that no matter what the outcome , that conservative Americans will find fault with Obama 's actions . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 6:03 pm | The same as it should be here in the States when it comes to violence and political unrest . \nIf we are truly tired of the bickering in the nations capital . \nMaybe we should protest and demand our leaders to straighten up and do what 's right for `` We the people '' . \nIf we can spend 1.3 billion on Egypt and not knowing how many other countries . \nWe can surely trim back here and pay off our nations debt for the two wars in the wrong countries and other projects unknown to the tax payer . \nBefore we have even more political unrest . \nOh yes , your question , let 's clean up our own country first and put it back into order . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 6:04 pm | We would , of course , all like to have the President come out and speak strongly for the people and the ousting of Mumbarak , but the President has to act responsibly and resist the urge to do so . \nTo do so would be a self-glorifying act , it would make him ` look good ' but would not BE good for anybody . \nHe should not be criticized for not seeking his own glory . \nHe should be praised for working diligently behind the scenes to get the Egyptian people to the democracy they seek with as little violence or risk of a ` crack-down ' as possible . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 6:04 pm | The US is caught in the middle on this one . \nI say butt out and let things take their course . \nObama is doing the right thing . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 6:07 pm | For Obama to talk about a government `` not '' trampling on the rights of its citizens is like Janet Napolitano going to another country to give advice on securing their borders while proclaiming `` our borders are as secure as they have ever been '' . \nNeither of them walks the talk !! Our borders are still wide open and Obama 's attempt to take away our freedoms such as the internet and guns , says all there is to say !! One scenario bothers me . \nSo Obama says it 's time for Mubarak to go . \nIn response Mubarak mows down the protesters , says to hell with the Israeli peace treaty , and keep your 3 billion dollars . \nWe will get our weapons and aid from Russia and China . \nTwo countries that have no problems dealing with the worst despots on the planet as long as they can make a buck . \nWhat do we do then Jack ? \nOur role in Middle East unrest ? \nBecause of our foreign policy -LRB- and tax dollars , -RRB- the Egyptian people are oppressed . \nFor once , could n't we keep our nose in our own business ? \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | It is the same as it always should be Jack , protect America 's best interests . \nMake no mistake , due to Obama 's lack of action , our country just got weaker . \nWhere we had a dictator sympathetic to our and Israel 's interests , we will have a dictator rise to power who is sympathetic to Iran 's interest . \nWhen a democracy would promote the Muslim Brotherhood to power , who are decidedly anti-western and anti-Israel , it does not benefit us . \nThe whole region is crumbling and I hope people like the idea of paying high energy prices . \nWith Obama 's anti-commonsense domestic energy policies and him sitting idly by and watching more of the world 's oil supply fall into anti-American hands , we are all going to be in a world of hurt . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | if USA gets involved they blame us , if we do n't they blame us too , ca n't the countries take care of their own government and well being of their own region ? \nWe got enough problems here in USA to take care of , no matter the importance of the conflicts all over the world , we ca n't babysit everyone ! \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 6:21 pm | See who wins their election , call and congratulate them . . \nSame as you would do any other country ? \nWhy is it even a question ? \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 6:21 pm | Apparently , President Obama is not only making good on his Cairo Speech w years ago , he also is not making good on his Nobel Peace Prize . \nIt seems that our president is more concerned with the benefactors and Big Oil money that put him into office , than to see the Arab oil company supported dictatorships go down like a house of cards . \nCan we say Iran , 1952 and 1979 ? \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 6:21 pm | There is no right side history on this one . \nEgypt is a complex situation . \nDoes anyone really beleive that some of the faces , some of the current organizers that we see on TV are not radical muslims from Iran or elsewhere . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 6:21 pm | Mubarak has robbed the youth and future of Egypt through his greed and corruption . \nThe government housing is falling apart and they wo n't fix it because it might take a few pounds out of his pocket . \nPut him on the talk-show and lecture circuit and I guarantee he 'll consider leaving by the end of the week . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 6:21 pm | Let me ask this : What role should Egypt play when rioters take to our streets in Detroit , or DC or Nashville ? \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 6:21 pm | Obama was too quiet on health care reform . \nHe was too quiet on the oil spill . \nHe was too quiet on financial regulatory reform . \nHe was too quiet on the DADT repeal . \nQuiet is President Obama 's style , Jack . \nWe should stand up for ANY demonstrations that are peacefully demanding Democracy . \nWe are the United States . \nThat 's what we do ! \nWe lost a great opportunity last year to take a greater stand during the Iraninian demonstrations , we should stand up firmly on the side of the demonstrators this time , and not let this opportunity pass us by ... grow a spine President Obama ! \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 6:22 pm | Im 14 and am interested in this , i thing that obama should support the protestors fully . \nAnd preach democracy to the protestors . \nIn my opinion he is n't doing enough and is embarrassing the U.S.A January 31 , 2011 at 6:23 pm | when the American Media can put this much interest in American democracy and freedoms it would be warranted . . \nBut its kind of hard to spread democracy when the people at home dont have it . . \nBut just like the American media lookin for the Best ratings story . . \nNot Whats best for America . . \nSo Americans will never be truly free . \nKeep playin IRAN 'S game . \nthey been working the American Media for years . . \nIts a shame ... January 31 , 2011 at 6:23 pm | There 's a great divide between what the US role should be and what is being practiced . \nRight now , the US is looking for a stable and relatively unchanging leadership that 's relatively friendly . \nWe should 've gone about promoting our ideals -- democracy and fair elections -- but we did n't . \nNow , in the eyes of the Arab people , we are the enemy , and they are certain to vote against us . \nThat 's a risk that the US just does n't seem to want to take , so they continue down the path of old instead of making real changes . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 6:23 pm | What IS the role ? \nOr what SHOULD it be ? \nThe role of the US Govt and security forces has seldom been on the side of the angels since Reagan in South America and maybe before . \nIt has propped up dictators and embraced oppressors from Egypt to China and back . \nWhat it should NOT be doing is giving MONEY to said dictators ! \nIn fact , foreign aid should be suspended everywhere until we recover financially assuming we ever do . \nWhat it SHOULD be going is standing for something , standing for democracy , standing for civil rights , standing for individual freedoms . \nI know diplomacy is a matter of inches and intrigues but we have never become befriended for either our diplomacy or our billions . \nPerhaps we would do better to simply stand for what we used to believe in -LRB- and most Americans still do -RRB- . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 6:23 pm | It 's time to stop providing support to these ungrateful , terrorist nations . \nIt 's time that the muslim world step up and quit taking handouts and spend some of their oil money . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 6:23 pm | Jack , I see the role of the US in handling this unrest as a of peacekeeping in Egypt , IF the UN requests our intervention . \nWe all know what happened when we went into Iraq without the agreement of the UN . \nPersonally , I 'm getting tired of the world always asking the US to intervene and save them , while at the same time degrading us . \nSmartest thing this Administration could do ? \n... do nothing unless the UN requests it . \nBottom line ... we 're screwed either way . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 6:24 pm | Why do we think we are the sole country in the world who should dictate our politics upon foreign states ? \nLet 's get out of the Middle-East period , including Iraq , Afghanistan , and all other states including any foreign aid for Israel . \nI am tired of the US trying to police the world , when we can not take care of ourselves . \nLook at our homeless , our people dying in need of transplants , etc. . \nLeave the rest of the world alone and take care of trade , econonmy , health , welfare , etc. let 's be honest Jack , regardless of how the president responds to this crisis , he is going to get slammed by someone in the media . \nHis response has been absolutely correct . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 6:24 pm | We started a war in Iraq to establish a democracy there , we need to be consistent . \nWe are either pro democracy in all cases or we should stay the hell out of things that are none of our business !! We have enough political unrest here at home . \nMaybe we should clean our own house before we tell others how to clean theirs ! \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 6:25 pm | The Million dollar question : Walking the thin line between supporting natural pro-Freedom and Islamists totalitarians who 'd like to see another -LRB- Gaza style -RRB- Hamastan , or Iran oppressive regime ... How about some clarity from the W.H. Supporting `` mainstream '' Egyptian Arabs and denouncing the fascist ` Muslim brotherhood ' who was established in the 1920s inspired by European fascism and started its Jihad already against the Brits , and has been the main source of radical Islam , the mastermind of the massacre of 3,000 innocent people by radical Islam -- Khalid Sheikh Mohamed was a `` Muslim brother . '' \nSimply put the atrive for an all oppressive Sharia dominated Caliphate `` dream . '' \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 6:25 pm | A little honesty and integrity by the U.S. would go along way to minimizing unrest and curbing violence in the Middle East . \nWhy do you think there are people who burning old glory and scream death to America . \nEncouraging real democracy , instead of brutal dictators , would help too ... along with stopping the prosituting of America to the military industrial complex . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 6:25 pm | Our role is to remember we do n't have a vote . \nIt is up to the Egyptian people . \nThis is what we would tell them if they tried to influence the USA . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 6:25 pm | We have no role in this revolt . \nEvery time we pick a side that we think is the democratic force we wind up sorry . \nBacking the rebels in Cuba gave us Castro . \nHelping out the Shaw of Iran gained us the Ayatola and his puppet Amanutjob . \nSticking our nose into Iraq wound us up with the very strong possibility of fat guy in the black turbin . \nStay out of it and set up a relationship with whichever side comes out the winner . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 6:26 pm | The US should assist Egypt toward a more democratic state so that any power transition will go more like the Philippines when Marcos left and not like Iran when the Shah left . \nHow to do that is for the diplomats , not twitter or facebook or the world media -LRB- that 's you , Jack -RRB- . \nBy the way how can it be said that Obama lost Egypt if Mubarak leaves or the power structure changes ? \nIt was n't his to lose . \nNow if Maine decided to leave the US and become part of Canada ... THAT would be his loss . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 6:26 pm | Let us Note Jack , that POTUS warned against the repercussions of the activities of such regimes as we 've seen in Egypt , how unrest tends do become the ultimate fate for repression . \nWhat he infact did not do was threaten governments and peoples with drastic US policy towards them when they did things that were n't favorable . \nHello , did you see the inauguration and the new strategy not to lecture of countries ? \nThis is what happens when you make a deal with the devil you know . \nThe US government always seems to support Democracy abroad , but we get squeamish when we think the people may choose a form of government that could be anti-American . \nIt 's just another variation of support for the dictator 's of Iraq , Iran , Saudi Arabia , and on and on ... January 31 , 2011 at 6:26 pm | The U.S. can do what it has long been preaching the world on . \nWe have an opportunity to dramatically improve our image -LRB- and ultimately , our security -RRB- if we will more vocally support the uprising . \nWe had this opportunity in Iran many years ago , and sat on our hands . \nThe result has been plaguing us ever since . \nWe should not pretend that these events will end with Egypt . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 6:26 pm | Whats going on in Egypt , and other places around the world that we the United States always seem to stick our nose into , will happen and we should as Obama is doing , watch and see . \nThe last thing we need is to piss off more of our `` allies '' . \nOur influence has worn out its welcome . \nWe talk about free society and let the people decide , , well let em decide . \nEnough Americans have given there life to push our agenda across the globe . \nBring em home to protexct our borders , but I suspect that makes too much sense . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 6:26 pm | A democracy is a bottom up process . \nWe can not and should not attempt to impose it . \nThe US is doing exactly what it should do -- working privately with key players to assist in pushing Mumbarak toward a peaceful transition toward a real democracy . \nThe risks are far too great for the President to get ahead of this , he needs to keep doing what he is doing and keep pace with it . \nI am glad we have a President who does n't risk the fragile peace of the region just so he can look like a hero . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 6:27 pm | President Obama has to do the right moral thing , which is to side on the democratic aspirations of Egyptians ... do Americans know that their government gives $ 1.3 billion a year of taxpayers dollars in military aid to the Mubarak regime ? \nthat should stop first . \nStay out of their political business and just try being good trading partners . \nWe live in a world where controlling countries , people , and their resources just will not fly anymore . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 6:28 pm | The role of the US is simple . \nAs reported on CNN we now know that several US Presidents including Ronald Reagan supported President Mubarak knowing in full force he is a Dictator since he NEVER had an opposition party . \nSo the role is simple ; US policy cares about the government politicians they deal with , not the people of the country . \nWhat I despise so much is to see our leaders talk about the people of Egypt . \nWhere were they for them for 30 years . \nLaith F. Gulli , Columbus , Indiana January 31 , 2011 at 6:28 pm | As an Egyptian American , I and many like me see the US as a beacon of freedom and justice . \nPeople kill themselves trying to come to this country for the opportunites it provides and freedoms it affords . \nIf the US decides to abandon the plight of the Egyptian people for a better life and future in favor of a dictator then it will have truly lost the souls and minds of freedom seekers around the world . \nThe US should shock and awe the nay sayers and side with the people of Egypt . \nOther wise Al-Qaida will have a recruiting bonanza . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 6:28 pm | Jack we need to do what the French did and give support to the people . \nwhen those crazy Brition 's had the guts to stand up and say no more . \nYou may remember them George Washington , Adams , Jefferson to name a few . \nThe U.S. Government will not suffer from this we the people will and I think if you check American 's are for the freedon of the people . \nAnd I am ready to suffer a little for them . \nHell oil prices are going up and there is no interruption of the flow , but hey someone has to get rich out of this . \nWhat happened to the price control laws ?? I think Our government needs to look into why oil is going up and support the people in their fight for freedom . \nBut I bet they will screw it up again by not doing what is right . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 6:28 pm | I believe that the US should provide the only the influences that we would accept in the same situation . \nHow receptive would the US population be if the United States were in a similar national debate , and Russia or China attempted to influence the outcome ? \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 6:29 pm | Anything we do will be wrong . \nIf we do nothing we look weak or indifferent . \nIf we take action we will be seen as taking over the country for aour own purposes and we will be stuck in another quagmire just like we are in Iraq . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 6:30 pm | The US administration has not only to protect our own interests in the Middle East , but also to support and protect our Allies , like Israel ! \nIf we lose these Allies , then we will lose the only door to any potentiial peace in the Middle East . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 6:30 pm | Looking at our history of dealing with the Middle East after WWII , we should stay out of it . \nMeddling gets us nowhere . \nWe pay for it sooner or later . \nRecently it took 50 years before we paid for it ... with lives . . \nIt is time that we realize that our actions have consequences . \nWe 're dealing with those consequences now with some in the Middle East mistrustful of us and extremists from there attacking us . \nStay on the fence and let those folk govern as they see fit whether it is democratic or not . \nWe may not like it , but we must respect it . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 6:30 pm | The United States and Israel have no business trying to influence another country 's internal affairs . \nWe talk about promoting democracy but the minute a country begins the transition , the US and Israel are the first to raise concerns about who the new leaders of that country will be . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 6:32 pm | If we are asked for help we should do as much as we can . \nIf we are not asked then we should mind our own business unless we are threatened . \nDuring the Yom Kippur war Egypt lost 250 tanks , Israel lost 25 . \nEgypt can not make tanks planes , helicopters or any kind of military equipment . \nWhoever ends up on top they need us . \nJim Parker The U.S. 's role in Middle Eastern politics is right about where it should be . \nThe US should not try to influence the direction in which politics run in the world directly , but the US should be present enough to prevent another dictator from grabbing hold no matter their political alignment . \nIf the US does decide to back a leader who ends up declaring Marshal Law for another three decades , it may not be viewed as the country that lost Egypt , but when another revolt arises , no one wants it to be their fault . \nUnlike all the `` extremist '' theories you here , Egyptians just want a leader who listens and acts , not someone who will sit around and line his pockets with money and continue to let people suffer . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 6:35 pm | The problem , Jack , is that while we 've been happy with him , most Egyptians are unhappy among other things with Mubarak 's support -LRB- and ours -RRB- of israel . \nNo need here to get into Israel 's treatment of Palestinians . \nWe pushed Mubarak to help our ally and we 're going to suffer for that support in Egypt as elsewhere in the Arab world . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 6:35 pm | The U.S. should have no role in Middle East politics . \nWe have lost all credibility in the region with double standard policies . \nIsreal can have nukes but Iran 's can not have a civilian nuclear program . \nThe Shah was a dictator so he had to go . \nSaddam was a dictator who was supported by us in the war with Iran yet when time came this dictator too had to go . \nNow it 's Mubarak , U.S. supported him for 30 years even though he betrayed his people and all Arab countries . \nNow it 's time for this dictator to go . \nShame on the architects of our foreign policy as we have lost all of our credibility and respect around the world . \nsend in da CIA ... start r back . . \nif 1 there already . . \na usa friendly allie to power January 31 , 2011 at 6:36 pm | Joe Ft Walton Bch Fl Very simple . \nThe US need to tell Mubarak to step down . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 6:39 pm | Don t just stand there , President Obama , stand up for the people of Egypt . \nTell the dictator of Egypt to go . \nSend a message to the world ! \nRead more at the Internet Free Press . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 6:40 pm | Mr. Cafferty , the USA has a great opportunity to win the hearts and the mind of the Egyptian people in particular and the Arab world in general . \nThe Egyptians have decided to bring Mubarak 's regime downe . \nThis is historical moment of the Egyptians history and is going to be documented , so Mr. Pres. which side you want to be ; whether black or white ! \nit 's a decison that will affect a nation of 80 million people . \nWhat the heck is the right side of history ? \nWhy should we get involved in the way every country is run ? \nEgypt is a sovereign nation and the way the people and the leaders decide to run it `` Yes '' is our business but not our responsibility . \nHave we forgotten Iraq so soon ? \nWhatever US interests need to be safeguarded within the arab world need to be done within diplomatic circles when Jullian Assange is not listening . \nCouple of things we need to get into our psyche : 1 . \nDemocracy is not the best way of governance for all peoples 2 . \nThe US can not intervene in every country because their leadership or system of governance does not agree with ours . \nWe need to get ourselves together first . \nWe just had one of most uncivilized elections in history ! \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 6:49 pm | Anything that President Obama says will only serve the right wing . \nWhat a world we live in today . \nSo ... I guess we stay silent . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 6:50 pm | It is very easy for someone to criticize as to why President Obama has not made a decision on supporting either Presidendt Mubarak or the Egyptian people . \nMany factors to be considered , you can not go in and take over making decisions prematurely . \nIf President Obama would have chosen sides already , he would very likely be criticized for the decision made , as being premature and possibly wrong . \nIt 's one of those cases that you 're damned if you do , and you 're damned if you do n't . \nGive him a little bit of time , and I am sure that he will make a good decision , and a wise decision . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 6:52 pm | Mubarak has been your ally and had your support for 30 years , you ca n't just turn out on him when everyone is against him ! \n... i 've been anti-mubarak since the day i was born , but he still is my president Egypt is his responsibility and not yours ! \nyou ca n't turn against him and force him to step away for he has n't abandoned his country and ran away from his people Egypt belongs to the Egyptians and they so can take care of their country it 's their business not yours and all you can do is STAY OUT OF IT . \nbeing on the right side of history is to support the people and you 're already doing a great job using the media , i think that is support enough and you ca n't physically take any actions against either Mubarak nor the People . \nAnd i think that Mubarak is leaving he knows that ... he has no intention to stay as the acting president anymore . \nFor the first time in a 30 years he 's assigned a vice president and a whole new government ... kind of telling the people that he is leaving but he 's not going to run away and leave the country to burn with no one in charge ! \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 6:53 pm | We have meddled in Egypt for so long now that the Egyptians are looking to us for the support they have earned over these past 30 years . \nWe need to make sure they get a shot at democracy . \nWe should see that Mubarak steps down , and then make sure free and fair elections take place . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 6:55 pm | As a professor of international relations I sum up the issue of promoting democracy simply to my students : the US sees democracy , especially in other countries , as an outcome of the political process , while most states see it as a process itself . \nIf we knew for sure that the Muslim Brotherhood or a similar faction would n't gain power we would be more vocal in supporting the movement . \nTruth is , democracy will always be second to security and so Mubarak will always be attractive to US foreign policy . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 7:00 pm | Jack Cafferty sounds off hourly on the Situation Room on the stories crossing his radar . \nNow , you can check in with Jack online to see what he 's thinking and weigh in with your own comments online and on TV . \nWould you ride in a car that drives itself ? \nIs she the answer ? \nShould the #LoneStarState be allowed to withdraw from U.S. ? \n"}

'' \nIn it , she attacks the process of foreign aid by explaining that it 's ineffective . \nIn 2009 Time Magazine listed her as one of the `` 100 most Influential People in the World . '' \nAnd this month she 's out with her second book entitled `` How the West Was Lost : Fifty Years of Economic Folly -- and the Stark Choices Ahead '' in which she talks about the inevitable decline of the West and the forces that brought it there . \nHere 's your chance to ask Dambisa Moyo your questions . \nDo you agree with her assessment of aid ? \nof the West 's future ? \nSend in your questions and do n't forget to tell us where you 're writing from . \nI agree with your assessment that the West will fall eventually , all great empires -LRB- if you can collectively call the West an empire -RRB- have . \nDo you have a time frame of when this will happen and if another super power , say China , will emerge , or are super powers a thing of the past ? \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 12:26 pm | Reply I totally agree with this wonderful lady . \nI am British and when I think of the damage that has been caused around the world because of western greed and imperialism it makes me ashamed of my identity . \nI have recently been amazed and humbled by the show of passion and courage of the Egyptian people in the recent struggle for freedom . \nThe other day I said to myself that I wish I was born an Egyptian after seeing just what a wonderful people they are . \nYou know that things are heading downhill in the US in particular when you are afraid to question your own government and its foreign policies . \nUS Americans still have freedom of speech and that can never be taken away from you . \nWe are supposed to live in a democracy and yet we seem to be ignored lately . \nLove will defeat evil . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 12:35 pm | Reply Where you find India in economic order by say 2030 . \nI am writing from India January 31 , 2011 at 12:35 pm | Reply The very fact that so far the US housing market has not reached the bottom does prove that the golden era of western world is over . \nIn fact the downward fall of US housing market will continue and the bottom will not be reached in foreseeable future . \nRight now US investors are misguided by US stock market . \nBut let us not forget that Dow Jones index is not a true indicator of US economy because it is manipulated by rich and powerful . \nTo get a true feeling about the economy what the investors should be looking for are the number related to National debt , unemployment etc. . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 1:04 pm | Reply I completely agree with your stance on the negative effect of AID to Africa and why it is completely dead on arrival . \nI believe to be able to work our way out , Africa needs some bold leadership ! \nLook at us right now , we can not even take a bold stance on Cote du Ivoire , where do you think the bold leadership will come from and under what style of governance ? \nOn the future of the West and its decline , does it include the USA -LRB- the center of innovation and freedom our current world -RRB- ? \nI believe one should seperate Europe from the USA as inspite of the current problems , the US remains the place where people want to go and live their dreams freely . \nI believe it this part of the human spirit that makes society great . \nChina is limited by its authoritarian rule and lack of innovation -LRB- ps what have they invented in the last 50 years ?

\nFIrstly for those who still talk about Karl Marx and communism , I suggest that you immediately review your junior high history , communism has never worked , doesnt work and will never work , Reagan was right , the only and most efficient way to lead a society without enslaving its people is through unobstructed capitalism . \nThose of you that talk about inequality between the west and some countries in Africa and Asia , well that is a sad truth . \nThere is , however , no way in which America is to blame , if you want to blame the west , blame England , who controlled a third of the world ages ago just like the Soviets did . \nThe inequalities are due to geographical position , many people in the west are sending aid over to Africa , if this women has a problem with them not being distributed , then she should get out there and actually do something about it like find her own company to distribute them in a better way . \nFor those people who still believe that America will fall then remember that this country build the world up , why do you think the US is policing the world ? \nBecause no-one else will , if you think that your country is better because you dont have soldiers in Iraq and Afganistan then go ahead . \nIn the minds of the rest of the world you are cowards . \nWhich country will step in if America pulls out and lets countries like Iran and North Korea develop nuclear weapons and then watches as their unstable governments launch them at the rest of the world ?

'' \nSuch discussions , he said , `` will achieve the democratic process . '' \nMubarak called on new government leaders to `` stand against anyone committing any forms of corruption '' and stressed `` the necessity to continue with fair , serious and effective new steps for more political , constitutional and legislative reforms . '' \nAs he did in a nationally televised early Saturday , Mubarak referenced the unsettled security situation across the country , in part due to a void created after police largely abandoned their posts . \nHe called on new government leaders to `` stop all the violence by whoever commits it , '' while appearing to criticize the Muslim Brotherhood , the country 's largest opposition party . \n`` The citizens and the young people of Egypt have gone out to the streets in peaceful demonstration asking for their right for the freedom of speech , '' Mubarak said . \n`` However , their demonstrations have been infiltrated by a group of people who use the name of religion who do n't take into consideration the constitution rights and citizenship values . '' \nThe president claimed that such people of `` giving the chance for criminal groups to loot and confiscate public and private property , spread fires and spread fear . '' \nMubarak commanded the new leaders `` to take care of the people , '' so that they again felt safe from looters and other criminal elements . \nMubarak expressed hope that the military could succeed in protecting Egypt and its institutions and soon go back to its original goal , `` which is to defend the country and its sovereignty .

{"id": "188", "time": "2011-01-31", "text": "By John D. Sutter , CNN Is the internet the modern megaphone and is it essential for a protest movement ? \nProtests in the Middle East raise questions about the internet 's role in democracy Some say the internet is a human right ; others that it 's not necessary for protest Egypt has cut access to internet and mobile phones ; protests continue -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Are we in the age of internet revolutions -- where Facebook , Twitter and text messages are essential ingredients in democratic change ? \nOr , as the ongoing protests in Egypt perhaps show , is the internet only one tool in this process -- nothing more than the modern version of the telephone ? \nAs violent demonstrations continue on the streets of Egypt -- where many are upset with the results of Hosni Mubarak 's 30 years in power -- tech pundits and bloggers are trying to sort out the internet 's role in the situation . \nSome say Egypt is violating modern human rights by cutting access to the internet and to mobile phone networks . \nOthers say the fact that protests have continued despite these digital barricades reveals a massive hole in the argument that social media spawns modern revolutions . \n`` Where activists were once defined by their causes , they are now defined by their tools , '' Malcolm Gladwell writes in The New Yorker . \nTo help make sense of these complicated arguments , here 's a wrap-up of what people are saying about the internet 's role in Egypt , where unrest continues , and in Tunisia , where protests earlier this month toppled the government and set off a wave of unrest in other Middle Eastern countries : `` We want to make sure that Egypt is not interfering with the use of social media . \nThat 's a fundamental right as clear as walking into a town square . \nWe 're making these points clear to Egypt , publicly and privately . '' \nDave Pell , writing on the blog Tweetage Wasteland , says the internet is n't essential for revolution -- but it sure helps : `` Yes , folks . \nThe Civil Rights movement took place at a time before Twitter . \nFor those scoring at home , the same is true for every notable historical movement from the Big Bang through the release of Destiny Child 's Bootlylicious video . \nThe realtime , social web is clearly not a required element to organize and execute a high impact revolution . \nNeither is a megaphone , but it sure makes it easier for the folks in the back to hear you . '' '' \n... Do n't confuse tools with root causes , or means with ends . \nThe protests in Tunisia , Egypt and Yemen are against dictators who 've held power -- and clamped down on their people -- for decades . \nThat 's the fuel for the engine of dissent . \nThe dozen or more protesters that self-immolated in Egypt did n't do it for the tweets . \n` It 's about years of repression and dictatorship . \nRevolutions existed before Twitter and Facebook , ' Issandr el-Amrani , a Cairo writer and activist , said in a telephone interview from Tunisia . \n` It 's really not much more complicated than this . ' \nOnly about a quarter of the Egyptian populace is online , el-Amrani estimated . \nSo street protests have grown the old-fashioned way : by leaflets and spontaneous amalgamation . '' \n`` Humans are functioning as defacto news aggregators using the publication tools already available . \nThis , while not a novel idea , really hit home in the past two weeks with the two subsequent revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt . \nWhat I and you probably noticed was that interested people we followed took it upon themselves to become individual nodes of information , using the tools they had to serve as their own news networks . '' \nIn The New Yorker , Nicholas Thompson , a social media expert , writes that the internet can benefit both sides of a conflict : `` Governments control the pipes through which all that information flows . \nThis means they can block sites or , as Egypt has just apparently done , shut down the entire Internet and thus confuse everyone who has come to rely on it . \nIn Iran , the government clearly had some success using the Internet to disrupt and slow the green revolution . \nIn Tunisia , the government hacked the password of nearly every Facebook user in the country . \nHad Ben Ali not fallen so quickly , that information would have been extremely useful . \nTechnological tools can be used quite effectively by the masses , or by the man . '' '' \n... technology -- not just the Internet but also mobile phones -- make -LRB- sic -RRB- it easier to trace protesters and dissidents . \nIt would be very hard , for example , to trace the names of everyone who gathered on Minsk 's central square to oppose the results of the recent elections in Belarus before mobile phones became ubiquitous . '' \n`` I think the right to connect now becomes a fundamental human right . \nAnd the problem here is we see that government is the single point of failure for the internet . \nWhether that 's the kill switch , as Egypt has used it , or whether it 's the fact that they control the structure for the internet . \nAnd so our future -- the means by which we 're going to build the next society -- is vulnerable here , and that worries me . \nAt the same time , I celebrate the fact that the people in a nation can use these tools to take charge . '' \n`` Would the State Department have gotten involved early on -LRB- remember , their first public comment was in respect to Tunisian Net freedom -RRB- ? \nWould Al Jazeera -- without offices on the ground -- have been able to report on the unfolding story as they did ? \nMost importantly , would any of that have mattered ? '' \nInternet access is `` fundamental '' to the protests in Egypt , writes Khadija Sharife on the Huffington Post : `` More than ever , the internet remains a crucial vehicle of sustaining and transmitting resistance by allowing for Egyptians to ` network the world ' about the machinery of Mubarak 's brutal regime . \nWhile it is not technology that has given life to the revolution but Egyptians themselves , catalyzed in part by their Tunisian neighbors , access is fundamental . '' \nIn The New Yorker , Malcolm Gladwell points out that protests -- and revolutions -- occurred long before the internet . \nTake the Civil Rights movement : `` Thousands were arrested and untold thousands more radicalized . \nThese events in the early sixties became a civil-rights war that engulfed the South for the rest of the decade -- and it happened without e-mail , texting , Facebook , or Twitter .

'' \nJohnQuest said , `` I was a young man when he visited New York , I still remember how people -LRB- Non-Catholics -RRB- admired him . \nAlthough I came from a non-believing family , I understand how some would be inspired by him . '' \nThere were some dissenters , like Silicon Valley , who said , `` He may have done much good , but he continued the legacy of Paul VI being theologically stuck in the Middle Ages , betraying the spirit of the Second Vatican Council called by John XXIII to move the Church into the modern era . \nHad he allowed priests to marry and\\/or allowed women in the priesthood the abuse scandal would not have reached the proportions that it did . \nThis was a step back for the RCC . '' \nCatholic or not , many people expressed love for the pope . \nTheDandyMan wrote , `` Absolutely the greatest pope in history ! \nSaint Karol Wojtyla , you are one of the greatest men that ever lived . \nMay you inspire billions more in your sainthood . \nSigned , a non-Catholic . '' \nANON said , `` He is one religious leader in the modern history who was and still is loved by the followers of many other religions . \nI 'm a Muslim , and I love him . \nHe practiced what he taught -LRB- tolerance , for example -RRB- . '' \nMilton said , `` The entire World used to love him . \nRegardless of religion , caste and country everyone admired him . \nI traveled myself nearly 40 countries and wherever go , people were talking very highly about Pope John II and Mother Teresa . '' \nIn this case , `` he '' is Jared Lee Loughner , the suspect in the Arizona shootings . \nFamilies responded to this story and told us they thought it was a powerful look at what really goes on in a situation like this . \nWhat if , indeed ? \nWe heard lots of personal stories about battles with mental illness and lots of takes on what a concerned loved one should do and what hurdles the health care system may create . \nCheck out this opinion piece from Joshua Coleman , and you 'll find passionate responses , like from Blue2054 : `` Even if he is mentally ill , the parents of an adult can not have 100 % control over him . \nThey might be scared that he would harm himself but would never imagine -LRB- or want to imagine -RRB- him becoming a murderer . \nThat 's just how parents are . \nLove compels them to see the positive things in their child . \nThey knew that he had drug problems , they knew that something was wrong with him . \nThat was why the dad decided to inquire Jared about what was in the bag and cared enough to follow him . \nHe was suspicious but I am sure he never thought that Jared was going to kill someone . \nI am probably too young to judge the parents but I wish they atleast took him to a psychiatrist or sent him to rehab after he was suspended . \nIt 's an unfortunate incident . \nWhat 's even sadder is that the alleged main target is recovering but the 6 others around her had to die for no fault of theirs .

'' \nsashlina liked the article : `` It 's amazing how many of us can point fingers and act like we have a doctorate in Know-it-allism when in fact the writer is clearly writing to the blinded society and NOT justifying what happened . \nKudos to Coleman for sharing the lenses of we - the finger pointers . \nI can say that because my initial reaction was the same . \nIn the end , it 's not always possible to recognize the signs and\\/or stop evil from happening . '' \nStarting to regret that dancing fish tattoo ? \n`` When -LRB- astrologers -RRB- say that the sun is in Pisces , it 's really not in Pisces , '' Parke Kunkle , a board member of the Minnesota Planetarium Society , told the Minneapolis Star Tribune . \nWHAT ?! Well , wait a minute , Westerners generally adhere to the tropical zodiac , so maybe nothing 's changed at all . \nThat brings up the whole question of tropical and sidereal zodiacs , or whether this whole thing matters at all . \nCommenters went at it . \nSome were astrological devotees , some got lost in an endless sea of references to the very-similar-sounding astrology or astronomy , and quite a few simply thought the whole thing was a bunch of bunk . \nThere were a lot of astrology skeptics on our comment boards , and a few of them said they were determined to prove that free will trumps the stars any day . \nAmong the seeming optimists were Jonathan , who wrote , `` What a relief , I was worried there for a second that I was n't who I thought I was all these years . \nI was afraid I 'd have to learn a whole new personality . \nWhich is really bad , because the signs on either side of me do n't fit me at all . '' \nJulia was also relieved . \nI 'm not a goal-setting , hard-working Capricorn and I knew it . \nI 'm an aloof and eccentric Aquarius . \nLong live the Aquarians ! '' \nSome thought perhaps the astrological system could be further refined . \nAunt Linda took the time to pen a detailed explanation of the concepts at hand -LRB- omitted here -RRB- and concluded on this note : `` The Babylonians designed a system of astrology that was as accurate as possible for their day . \nWould n't it make sense for modern astrologers to do the same ? '' \nJoshua said , '' ` Fun and harmless . ' \nIs that why there 's people that wo n't leave their homes on days when their horoscope gives a bad outlook ? \nIs that why people spend all their money going to astrologers to get their fortunes read ? \nAstrology , tarot , etc , is all stupid B.S. that should be expunged from society , especially those astrologers that lie to their customers and tell them its real , when they know it to be fake . '' \nNeerav replied , `` I agree , Joshua . \nThe reality is , unless you believe in the idea of predestination , that you are in control of your destiny , and not what is told by the position of the stars and planets in an artificially -LRB- and arbitrarily -RRB- divided up sky . \nThis year , I am challenging each and every yearly astrology forecast for my zodiac sign -LRB- Ariers -RRB- in order to prove once and for all that they are useless and have no relevance to how we live our lives or determine our destiny . '' \nA fairly cynical hobart said , `` I think someone should do a study with 1,000 subjects and three treatment groups : 1 . \ntropical zodiac , 2 . \nsidereal zodiac , and 3 . \na postmodern random essay generator . \nEach treatment group writes a horoscope for each subject , and at the end o of the day , we see which one wins . \nI bet it 's a three-way tie . '' \nthis sucks said , `` So can I continue to blast the soundtrack for HAIR from my car or do I need to buy a new CD because of all of this ? '' \nBob replied , `` You should get a new CD because the music in Hair sucks , not because its inaccurate . '' \nIn a follow-up story , we received even more heated comments : RabiaDiluvio said , `` Breaking news : we just discovered that the Easter Bunny might be brown instead of white and Santa wears yellow and black sweaters on the weekend . '' \nDoomguy said , `` What a pile of crap . \nThe fact that your sign can shift over the centuries is just more proof that astrology is a fantasy . \nIn fact , some of the stars in the actual constellations themselves have moved since astrology was dreamed up . \nPlease people ... this is the 21st century . \nCan we move past invisible boogey men , fiery pits and pitchforks and the layout of stars in the sky somehow controlling your life ? '' \nneptuneguy said , `` If you are that concerned about your zodiac sign , then this may actually change your identity . \nFor the rest of the world , you might as well worry about changing your underwear .

'' \n-- JRR The viral story of Ted Williams , a homeless man with an amazing radio voice , captivated our readers . \nAn outpouring of support came for this man , who was given a job with the Cleveland Cavaliers basketball team as a result of the publicity . \nCheck out what CNN.com readers had to say about this and other stories on CNN.com . \nMost of the responses , like from Elliot , were in support . \nHe wrote , `` I am pleased to say that I 'm from Columbus as well . \nThis is truly remarkable and to watch this man this morning break down and cry because of the offers and gestures of kindness , it was amazing . \nI really wish him the best and want to thank everyone that has seen the same opportunity to ` HELP ' as we here locally saw . '' \nKevin Kunkel said , `` Big pat on the back to the Cleveland Cavaliers for being in a position and willing to give this guy a new chance in life . '' \nVeritas was among those who hoped this news would encourage more people to look at the homeless in a different light . \n`` God bless you William . \nHomeless does not mean hopeless . \nMany wonderful , talented , intelligent people are homeless due to the state of the economy . \nOnce someone is homeless even for a short time , opportunities dissipate for jobs . \nNo phone , no address , no transportation , no shower , no soap , and it goes on . \nWe should all thank God for the little things we often take for granted , and show our appreciation by helping those less fortunate . \nNo matter how little we have it is without a doubt more than someone else . \nBelieve me it will come back to you tenfold . '' \ngman asked , `` What the heck is wrong with people ? \nHe had a radio job and got into drugs . \nMany homeless people were skilled that ran into mental or drug problems , etc. . \nWhy is it such a shock that a homeless guy has a skill ? \nIt is insulting . '' \nCleareye was wary of the story , `` This is a little too perfect . \nNevertheless , if this guy cooked up this as publicity for himself , then cool . \nHe has a great look to go with the voice . \nHollywood here he comes ! '' \nBut most of the respondents were very supportive , and we heard from many in the radio industry . \nDan Brand-Levitan was in awe : `` Dude . \nI 'd love to have pipes like that . \nI 'm a former radio guy . \nHad to get out of the biz because the poor job markets and my debt load made it impossible . \nIf I had pipes like that , I 'd be in big with the money . '' \nMark Gunn said , `` I 've been in radio for 33 years and it 's stories like this that continue to make this a worthwhile career option . \nI am so very proud of this business right now . \nI listened to Ted this morning and the people that stepped up to offer him a second chance made for some really compelling radio . '' \nThe emotional scene of veteran Rep. John Boehner of Ohio inheriting the speaker 's gavel and shaking hands with Rep. Nancy Pelosi got commenters going . \nBoehner appeared to shed tears as he took the gavel , sparking a passionate debate about the future of Congress , and the true nature of the sobs . \n44mlm wrote , `` America , our long national nightmare is half over . \nIn 2012 we will finish the job . '' \nA commenter using the nickname BlubberingB and an avatar of an emotional Boehner wrote , `` Please call me Mr. Boehner . \nDo you have a Kleenex ? '' \nJPatcher responded , `` It shows they really do have emotions . '' \nSeveral commenters referencing the moment in question said the oversized gavel reminded them of the mallet used in the arcade game Whack-a-Mole . \nohcynicalone wrote , `` Boehner , dude , you ca n't look away like that when you play Whack-a-Mole . \nLook , there is a mole in a blue dress with pearls popping up beside you ! '' \nBut JonJon20 said that it 's `` hard to hit anything when you ca n't see through your own tears . '' \nFinally , 10001NYC echoed what still others were feeling : `` I love it when one group of lying , cheating , self-aggrandizing thieves turns power over to another group of lying , cheating , self-aggrandizing thieves . '' \nReaders had a strong connection to Rafferty 's work and shared personal stories about what his songs mean to them . \nMany commenters also talked about the still-undetermined cause of death and speculation that the crooner was abusing alcohol . \nFrom there , many commenters shared stories and opinions on alcoholism in society . \ndepeche68 wrote , `` I used ` Right Down The Line ' at our wedding going on three years ago , and it made me cry that night as I looked at my beautiful wife . \nHis music will be close to me forever . \nI am sorry it ended the way it did for Gerry . \nMaybe a few people will see the light before it is too late . '' \nepdm said , `` I 'd give my right arm to be able to write a song as great as ` Baker Street , ' and that was just one of many from this huge talent . \n... So sorry to learn of his painful last years . \nRest now , Gerry . '' \nwestTN said , `` His story reminds me why I stay sober . \nI did n't want to go out the way he did . \nI ` gave up the booze and the one night stands . ' \nSounds as if he could n't . \nI hope he found some peace before he died . \nThanks for the great tunes . '' \nThis was easily the most-commented story of the day . \nJust about every reader was outraged about something . \ntwirler wrote , `` No question the African slave trade , the Holocaust and the treatment of American Indians are gigantic horrors of human behavior . \nCan we learn from these events and go forward ? \nCan the generations of all races and religions in the 21st century be free of the blame and guilt and hate that belongs to perpetrators centuries ago ? \nWill the hatred of blacks toward whites ever end ? '' \nAnd mastmom said , `` Consider 205 years of slave ` trading . ' \nIt is a clean word -- trade . \nMuch cleaner than kidnapping . \nEight generations of people : children , women and men subjected to horrific lifelong physical abuse and suffering until their death . \nNothing in history compares to that misery . \neverything99 replied , `` If humankind is 1 million years old as they say , I am sure they have produced situations pretty much like this many times . '' \nSeveral readers took issue with the article and the responses it got , and much debate ensued . \namidiots wrote , `` My problem is people 's assumption that because Africans are involved in the slave trade , that Black Americans are to forgive modern racism or take credit for part of the problem . \n... White people asserted that the position of Blacks were less than human to justify the act and position themselves as the dominant race ... that is the beginning of modern racism . \nNot slavery but the idea that certain races are inherently stupid or less capable .

{"id": "45", "time": "2011-01-31", "text": "Protesters Call for `` March of Million '' ; Interview with Mohamed ElBaradei Aired January 31 , 2011 - 23:00 ET THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT . \nANDERSON COOPER , CNN ANCHOR : We are live in Cairo where it is 5:00 a.m. on this the 8th day of the uprising in Cairo . \nWhat this day holds nobody can tell . \nAnd this may be a make or break day for the Mubarak regime . \nThey are calling it a `` Million-Man March '' . \nThat is scheduled -- it is scheduled to start in some four hours from now . \nHow many people will actually show up ? \nWe do n't know . \nWhere they will go , we 're not sure what will happen , we simply ca n't tell . \nThe Mubarak regime is certainly trying to make it as difficult as possible for the protesters to gather , shutting off train service . \nThe last Internet provider ISP has shut down as well . \nAnd we anticipate the cell phone service will be cut shortly . \nThe Egyptian military has promised not to harm protesters , but as we saw today in Liberation Square , this situation can turn violent very , very quickly . \nCOOPER : From terror to triumph we still do n't know exactly what occurred in that situation that caused the military troops to fire in the air . \nIn the end the crowd was chanting `` The people and the military are one . '' \nBut take a look at the fear on the face of that Egyptian soldier holding his gun at the protesters ready to shoot . \nOthers finally shot in the air . \nThat is the look of fear , and we -- you rarely get to see that so clearly in the face of one soldier here . \nThe military obviously playing a crucial role and what -- how they react to this protest today may be a turning point , maybe a critical juncture . \nWe 'll talk to Ben Wedeman and others about that and what they anticipate . \nBut I want to tell you a few of the other updates . \nAs we said , cell phone service is likely to be cut here . \nAmerican civilians are trying to be -- are trying to evacuate as much as possible . \nAs many as thousands of -- a thousands of Americans were evacuated on Monday in special U.S. government charters , that they have to reimburse the U.S. government for . \nThey were sent to -- to sites in Europe . \nAnd from there it 's up to them to -- to -- to book their onward travel . \nU.S. Marines -- a special contingent of U.S. Marines is coming to the United States embassy to secure the embassy here in Cairo ; non - essential diplomatic personnel , their families are also being evacuated here . \nIt is a very tense situation on this the 8th day . \nThe U.S. now has named a special envoy , a former ambassador to Cairo , a retired State Department official who will be meeting with the Mubarak regime . \nBut what that regime decides to do frankly , at this point , is anybody 's guess . \nI want to show you a little bit of what we saw today in the hours that we spent in Liberation Square . \nCOOPER -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Tense moments today near Liberation Square . \nSoldiers fire into the air to keep protesters at bay . \nThe threat of violence is constant , but nothing so far has stopped the daily demonstrations for change . \n-LRB- on camera -RRB- : It 's about 4:00 in the afternoon . \nThe curfew began an hour ago . \nBut still more and more people are arriving here in Liberation Square . \nThey 're incredibly enthusiastic , even though it 's the 7th day of protests . \nThey are determined to keep this going . \nThey 're chanting saying they 're not going to leave this square until -- until Mubarak leaves . \n-LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Young and old , they seem to come from all walks of life , all with the same message for Mubarak . \nI mean , I do n't know what kind of language do we have to say it to him in , but he 's got to learn that people do n't want him . \nThey have seen what the police forces can do in his name and they will not accept him anymore . \nCOOPER : Overhead a military helicopter circles constantly , a reminder that Mubarak 's government is still in place . \n-LRB- on camera -RRB- : It 's difficult to get a sense of how large the crowd really is here in Liberation Square . \nBut it does -- you get a feel for it when you actually try to move through . \nIt 's -- it 's actually incredibly crowded . \nPeople are just packed wall to wall . \nThere is no central leadership or anything . \nThere 's sort of different groups chanting different slogans , all of them , of course , anti- Mubarak . \n-LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Hour after hour , the chanting continues , many are tired but they refuse to leave . \nThis is just the basic -- basic needs for a -- for any human being . \nYou know , a shelter to live in , you know food , education , medicine . \nCOOPER : That 's what people are wanting here ? \nBut the whole world is afraid that this government is going to turn into the harbor for terrorists . \nNo , this is actually not . \nWe hate terrorists as much as the whole world . \nCOOPER : This is n't about fundamentalism ? \nThe people actually -- they are under poverty level they live in Egypt right now . \nAnd it is -- this is the time -- this is the time for some kind of change to happen . \nOtherwise , we 're never going to be able to change . \nCOOPER : The Islamist group , the Muslim Brotherhood has begun to take part in the protests , but no one group here is calling the shots . \nWe have no problem with Israel . \nWe have peace -- peace agreement . \nMubarak tries to let the people think that the Muslim Brother will control the country and will start to be -- making a war . \nActually that is not true . \nWe -- COOPER : So if Mubarak leaves you do n't think the Muslim Brotherhood would take over ? \nWe 're not going to allow them . \n-LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Tomorrow a massive protest has been called , the pressure keeps building . \nThe protesters hope something soon has got to give . \nCOOPER : Some of the people on the scenes we saw today in Liberation Square . \nAnd as we said , it 's just four hours until this massive protest is planned . \nI 'm joined now by Ben Wedeman and Ivan Watson here in Cairo . \nAnd also in Alexandria , I 'm joined by Nic Robertson who 's there . \nBen , what are you anticipating was going to happen today ? \nBEN WEDEMAN , CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : Well , of course the job of anticipating has become very risky here , because this whole protest movement has just sort of popped up in the last week , so it 's very difficult to say . \nBut we know that people are walking to Cairo from the Nile Delta . \nWe know that despite the fact the government has cut the Internet , you ca n't send SMS 's , BlackBerrys do n't work . \nAnd in -- within moments we expect the cell phone system to go down . \nWe know that word has passed just by word of mouth , throughout the entire country . \nSo I think we can anticipate a huge demonstration . \nA million , it could be more , it could be slightly less . \nBut this will be probably the biggest demonstration we 've seen in Cairo yet . \nCOOPER : Are you nervous about it ? \nWEDEMAN : Of course I 'm nervous . \nI 'm nervous , because I have a family here . \nAnd we 've seen that since this has begun , the security situation in -- in Cairo has deteriorated dramatically . \nThis is one of the safest cities on earth under normal circumstances . \nBut at the moment we see the police , even though they 're back in small numbers , just disappeared . \nThey were pulled out of the country -- out of the city in the morning of Saturday . \nAnd basically , security is now in the hands of the army in some areas . \nBut for the most part in Cairo , it 's the job of people in the neighborhood going out with baseball bats , shotguns , whatever they can find because the worry is that this current political uproar is just sending this country down the drain economically . \nThe infrastructure is n't working . \nCOOPER : Now you -- we -- we 've heard from demonstrators that they plan to actually go to the residence of President Mubarak . \nIs -- is that likely ? \nWEDEMAN : I know that between the Tahrir Square and the Ipihadia -LRB- ph -RRB- Palace on the eastern edge of this city , there are around 20 army checkpoints . \nIt 's going to be very difficult for them to go , unless simply the army steps aside and says you can go . \nOtherwise it could be very difficult . \nWe 've heard that one of the targets of the demonstrations is state TV just up the block from here . \nThere you have it surrounded by tanks . \nThey 've now put barriers on the roads . \nSo there is a real anticipation that they could move towards some of these strategic sites . \nCOOPER : Ivan , you were out at the pyramids today , which are close to Giza , I believe which are -- are very close to the city . \nI just want to show some of that video that you saw . \nIVAN WATSON , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT -LRB- on camera -RRB- : Crews have been deployed around the city , and the tanks are even parked here at one of the ancient wonders of the world the Great Pyramids of Giza . \n-LRB- voice-over -RRB- : An army officer insisted the pyramids are still open for tourists , but the soldiers would n't let us come any closer . \n-LRB- on camera -RRB- : This is part of what has Egyptians so scared right now , a number of hotels and cabarets and casinos like this that were torched and looted in the first days of the protests . \n-LRB- END VIDEO CLIP -RRB- COOPER : It does seem , Ivan , in -- it seems to me that the Egyptian military have kind of clamped down today , in terms of making it more difficult for protesters to get access and journalists to get access . \nWas that your experience ? \nWATSON : Yes , they look like they have taken a more -- you could -- could say aggressive posture . \nAnd what was really striking is we heard some reports that hey , the -- the police were supposed to be back out on the streets . \nI saw a handful of traffic cops , really . \nAnd instead , what was really striking , was seeing just how much the military had fanned out throughout the city , in force , all the way up until Giza and especially in front of everything from telecommunications buildings , the cell phone buildings to -- to parliament and -- and important , you know , intersections as well apparently trying to fill in some of that law and order vacuum that Ben was just talking about . \nCOOPER : Nic Robertson , you are in Alexandria , which is to the north of where we are in Cairo . \nThere is a march planned there as well . \nWhat are you anticipating , what are you hearing about what 's going to happen ? \nNIC ROBERTSON , CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : They say there will be a million people here , they say they 're going to focus on gathering in the Martyr Square -LRB- ph -RRB- , the Martyr Square is also where the main rail station is here . \nSo they already know that if the rail networks are hit and trains ca n't run they 're may -- they 're going to lose people there . \nAnd they know they 're going to have a difficult -- they 're going to have difficulty organizing if the cell phones are n't working . \nSo they 've been through that on Friday , and they say that they 're going to push ahead regardless . \nIt 's hard to imagine that they will get a million people in this city . \nBut they know that this is a day where they need to really push up the momentum . \nAnd -- and they , unlike Cairo , perhaps , have fewer choices of -- of sort of buildings , government buildings that they can really target that might make a difference in toppling President Mubarak . \nBut -- but regardless , they 're going to gather , they say and -- and keep pushing and keep the men from going -LRB- ph -RRB- . \nSome people say well , it might be done by Friday and other people are kind of less optimistic about it , they say this may take a whole lot longer -- Anderson . \nCOOPER : Ben how will -- I mean , how much longer can this go on for without something breaking one way or the other ? \nWEDEMAN : It really ca n't go on much longer , because the economy 's at a standstill . \nThe stock market 's been closed now for two days . \nLast week it just went through the floor , it crashed . \nBanks are n't working , universities , schools , the railroad system is n't working , the Internet . \nI mean , basically , this country has come to a screeching halt . \nAnd the feeling is that people within the regime around Mubarak are going to have to calculate that eventually the costs of this shutdown are going to get so high that when they do take over , if they do take over from Mubarak , they 're going to be dealing with a massive mess in this country . \nSo we 're really teetering on the brink of chaos in this country . \nCOOPER : We were talking before we went on the air and you made some really interesting points about how people live here ; that a vast majority of people are living one day to the next . \nThey 're -- they 're working one day in order to earn money for their families that night to eat . \nAnd because they are not working and banks are closed , people just do n't have money . \nWEDEMAN : And basically 40 percent of the population lives on less than $ 2 a day . \nAnd what they -- what you earn in the day , you feed your country in the evening -- I mean you 're family in the evening . \nAnd so this explains why there has been so much looting , so much ransacking of stores and what-not because people live such a day-to - day existence . \nCOOPER : We 're going to have a lot more with Ben Wedeman , and Ivan Watson , Nic Robertson as well throughout this hour , the best correspondents in the region . \nWe 're going to continue to draw on their expertise . \nWe 're also going to show you the latest on American civilians trying to get out of this country , as I said , more than a thousand evacuated by U.S. charters today . \nThe airport is a -- is a disaster zone right now in terms of trying to get out . \nIt is very difficult for people . \nWe 'll also talk to two Americans who are stranded here right now and hoping to get out in the days ahead . \nCOOPER : It 's easy to find a number of businesses which have been looted in downtown Cairo . \nThis is a Samsung customer service center . \nThis one got broken into on Friday night . \nThere 's been a large group of people came , broke in , tried to take whatever they could . \nSince then we 've seen these civilian militias , these local neighborhood groups which have popped up on just about every street corner , particularly after curfew , they armed themselves with guns in some cases . \nBut more often than not with knives and clubs and sticks to try to -- not only to protect their homes , but also protect businesses on that street . \n-LRB- END VIDEO CLIP -RRB- COOPER : In a moment we 're going to talk to two young Americans who have been living here for several months . \nAnd are looking to get out or trying to get out in the next couple of days . \nWe 'll tell you about how difficult that is for them . \nBut first , I just want to tell you there are some 50,000 Americans who live and work in Egypt though , the exact number of who are in the country at this point nobody really knows unless they 've registered with the State Department , which most have not . \nSome 2,400 or so Americans have asked the U.S. State Department -- 2,600 , excuse me -- have asked the U.S. State Department for aid in getting out of the country . \nStarting today , the American government started flying out voluntary evacuations , families of -- of diplomats , but also tourists and others who are Americans who are living here who wanted to get out . \nThey 've flown out about 900 or so on Monday . \nThey hope to fly out another thousand or so on this day , Tuesday . \nIt 's already Tuesday morning here . \nI want to check in with Jill Dougherty who has the latest on the evacuation . \nJill what 's the scene ? \nJILL DOUGHERTY , CNN FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT : Well you know , Anderson , really they are using everything that they possibly can to get the word out . \nThat 's the main thing , because of course communications are basically down . \nThey do have a good Web site ; the State Department 's Web site has a lot of information if you can get Internet coverage . \nThey 're also using you know , radio , TV , social media , e-mail , whatever -- whatever is possible . \nAnd interestingly , they 're also encouraging people who have relatives who might be outside of the country , outside of Egypt to contact if possible their relatives and help them out and give them some information . \nOne thing that they do point out is , the airport apparently does not have a curfew , but the city does . \nSo they are saying , you know , if there 's a curfew in place then Americans should n't be going across the city to the airport -- Anderson . \nCOOPER : And at this point also , they 're -- they 're now going to be sending U.S. Marines to -- to basically secure the U.S. Embassy here in Cairo as well , correct ? \nDOUGHERTY : Yes , they 've -- they 've sent a team that 's going in there . \nThey 're pretty heavily armed and they 'll be you know , beefing up what you normally get at the embassy . \nAnd then also , Anderson , in terms of beefing up , they 're also beefing up the evacuation for Americans , because there are pockets of Americans throughout the country that might need some help . \nAnd so this is what P.J. Crowley , the State Department spokesperson told us today about that . \n-LRB- BEGIN VIDEO CLIP -RRB- P.J. CROWLEY , SPOKESMAN , STATE DEPARTMENT : Tomorrow we expect to begin to add other destinations . \nWe might have two flights tomorrow going to Frankfurt , but as we also have begun to do -- do surveys around the country . \nWe will , as soon as we can have flights go into Aswan and Luxor in -- in the next day or two , as we 've identified pockets of American citizens in those locations as well . \nDOUGHERTY : Yes , so they are using charter flights , they actually used a Canadian plane today . \nU.S. military plane , and eventually they 're hoping , as you said , tomorrow they 're going to be starting out and trying to do at least as well as they did today in getting people out . \nCOOPER : I appreciate that report . \nWe 'll continue to follow that . \nI want to introduce you to Jessie Sobrino and Tom Traylor , two Americans who have been living here . \nYou guys have been here what , for five or six months ? \nTOM TRAYLOR , AMERICAN STUCK IN CAIRO : Five months . \nJESSICA SOBRINO , AMERICAN STUCK IN CAIRO : Yes . \nCOOPER : So at what point did you decide it 's time to get out ? \nTRAYLOR : For me that decision was made -- you know , normally I 'm pretty comfortable walking around the city just about anywhere . \nBut in the last few days as I 've been out and people have kind of identified me as an American , and there -- they 've -- as an -- as an American they 've been saying , that you know , we 're pretty upset about your -- your country 's position on supporting Mubarak . \nAnd the minute that they started being hostile towards me that was like ok , I need to find somewhere else to go . \nCOOPER : Do you feel -- feel that as well ? \nSOBRINO : I do . \nFor me actually the turning point was about a day before him . \nJust because I 'm female I could n't go roaming the streets as much as Tom had the opportunity to . \nSo the anti-American friends made me really experience to the same extent , that 's the organization that I work for , I write reports mostly for the upper class businessmen . \nAnd given the economy my job 's really -- COOPER : And you live in a neighborhood , how -- how is the security there ? \nI mean , there 's no police around ? \nSo is there one of those neighborhood watches ? \nTRAYLOR : Well , you know we are very fortunate because we live in Zamalek , that the building we live in , because there are so many Egyptian families outside of our building at any one time , there could be like 20 to 50 armed men protecting our building . \nSo we 're very fortunate in that respect . \nI can imagine like being in some other neighborhood without having that and -- and it could be , you know , even with that -- still that presence , we still hear gunfire like every night . \nCOOPER : There 's no doubt there 's a lot of folks at the U.S. State Department working very hard , they 're probably understaffed trying to get people out . \nBut we 're hearing a lot of frustration from Americans who are n't able to contact the U.S. State Department . \nThey put out a statement the other day saying , well contact our Web site . \nBut obviously there 's no Internet service here . \nHow -- how -- what 's your experience been ? \nHave they -- have you called them ? \nSOBRINO : I mean I registered upon arriving here at the end of August . \nAnd then one of the roommates that we 're staying with called and said , here are the individual are here , here 's our home phone lines , and cell phones have been in and out . \nWe have n't had any direct contact . \nAnd everything we 've heard about the State Department has been through the media and not directly from an embassy representative . \nThe most -- the most helpful advice we 've gotten are from friends who are working for the embassy , but not directly from them . \nCOOPER : So are you planning to take a commercial -- because commercial flight are still going but a lot of commercial flights have been canceled or delayed and the airport scene is just a nightmare . \nI met someone when I flew in , on I guess it was on Sunday , who had been there for 48 hours and still no word . \nHow are you going to try to get out ? \nTRAYLOR : Well , fortunately for us , because we have a place to live , we 're able to contact our families , and we 're having them get tickets for us . \nAnd because we have a place to live , we can kind of hang out for a little bit you know , try to get past the rush of all the tourists getting out . \nAll of the foreign tourists are getting out as well . \nSo we 're able to contact our families , they are getting tickets for us , and then we 're just kind of waiting it out in Zamalek until -- you know , hopefully by the time we leave on Friday and Saturday , it will be a little bit calmer there . \nCOOPER : So you think Saturday you have a flight out ? \nTRAYLOR : As far as I know right now , on Saturday I have a flight out . \nNow , whether it happens , as we 're hearing from our friends that are at the airport right now that you -- you know , you could have a flight and the flight could be delayed for 24 or 48 hours . \nSo -- COOPER : So your friends are stuck at the airport ? \nSOBRINO : My grandmother was there for 36 hours . \nShe actually came to visit me on Thursday and ended up being stuck there for an extended period of time . \nCOOPER : You 're grandmother picked the worst time to visit you . \nI 'm sure your grandmother loves you very much but -- SOBRINO : She made it to London , though , so that 's good . \nAnd my flight 's going out to Paris on Friday afternoon hopefully and we 're going to try and get there about 24 hours in advance . \nCOOPER : What -- what do you want people in the United States to know about what 's happening here from your perspective ? \nTRAYLOR : I say from my perspective , that the first thing I 'd like people to know , is that for the most part the protesters that I 've encountered , and I 've been out a lot during the day , you know these are individuals who just want their freedom . \nAnd a very telling sight for me is that there 's a point where I was in -- I was observing one of the protests last Tuesday . \nAnd myself and a couple of other foreigners were maybe a little too close to the front and as people started to run away from the police , some Egyptian men saw us and they surrounded us to protect us from the crowd leader . \nAnd I -- I felt most of the time , like that -- that is how the protesters are reacting you know , this is all about them wanting freedom . \nAnd so they 've been very , very gracious to me as a foreigner . \nCOOPER : Are you concerned about what may happen today in the hours ahead ? \nTRAYLOR : Oh yes , absolutely . \nI mean , you know , we 're hearing from the friends that we have that this is going to be like -- this is going to be a very , very large day . \nAnd so you know , this is a day for me that I 'm going to be inside . \nCOOPER : Jessie and Tom , I want to thank you for being with us . \nI know it 's even a risk coming here . \nSo we do appreciate that , and wish you the best of luck in getting out . \nCOOPER : Thank you very much . \nWhen we come back , we 're going to have the conversation I had with Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei today . \nA former IAEA official , a Nobel Peace Laureate who is here , returned here on Thursday . \nWe 'll talk to him about what he sees the next step being . \nCOOPER -LRB- on camera -RRB- : There 's a much heavier presence of the Egyptian soldiers on the streets in Cairo . \nAnd they 're having a little bit of a heavier hand today . \nThey 're blocking off certain traffic routes , and they 're blocking off certain exits and entrances to the Square . \nSo it 's harder and harder to get to the Square . \nA lot of people say that they are trying to give a show of force or give a sense that they 're -- they 're in control of the situation . \nCOOPER : One of the things that President Hosni Mubarak has done officially and effectively over the last 30 years he 's been in power is , never really allowing significant opposition forces to grow in this country . \nSo if he is removed from power or steps down from power , there 's a real question about who would move in to fill that vacuum ? \nWould it be the military ? \nWould some other political figure arise ? \nWould the Muslim Brotherhood take on a greater role ? \nAnd , frankly , no one knows the answers to those questions , but one name that 's become more well-known in the last couple days is Mohamed ElBaradei , who was the former head of the IAEA . \nThat 's may be where you have heard his name , if you 'd heard it all . \nBut he 's lived most of the last three decades outside of Egypt . \nEven though he 's Egyptian , he 's lived outside of Egypt . \nSo he does n't really have a huge popular base of support in this country . \nHe only returned to this country on Thursday , but his name and -- it has become more well-known , he 's taken on more of a prominent role in the last several days . \nAnd there 's talk -- he has said that he 's had talks with the opposition figures and with the protest organizers to try to talk about forming some sort of government of national unity , if and when President Mubarak does leave . \nI talked to Mohamed ElBaradei earlier on Monday . \nCOOPER : What is happening today ? \nWhat are you doing today ? \nMOHAMED ELBARADEI , OPPOSITION LEADER : Well , what I 'm trying to do today is see the way forward , Anderson , when clearly people are going to continue to demonstrate . \nThere is a large demonstration planned for tomorrow . \nIt might be even bigger Friday if things does not move . \nI think the number one priority for the people and industry , everywhere right now is for Mr. Mubarak to get a dignified exit . \nCOOPER : There is concern in some quarters -LRB- ph -RRB- in the United States about what comes after Mubarak . \nWhat do you say to try to alleviate people 's concerns ? \nELBARADEI : I think that there 's friction , frankly in some quarters in the U.S. . \nOne , if democracy were to come here , they might automatically be hostile to -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- and that 's not true at all . \nYou know , we -- peace between democracies is much more durable than peace between dictators . \nCOOPER : How controlled are things right now , in terms of every day knowing what 's going to happen ? \nELBARADEI : Nobody knows . \nI mean , that is also -- COOPER : You do n't even know ? \nELBARADEI : I do n't even know . \nI mean as you can see , Mubarak is keeping mum -LRB- ph -RRB- . \nNobody knows what he 's thinking , why is he staying ? \nAs I mentioned yesterday , I think it was Fareed Zakaria , who has an -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- with this . \nHe now for , the sake of the country , should just go . \nAnd nobody knows what is -- what the new government is going to look like . \nPeople are not accepting just shuffling of people because it 's -- the demand for change is quite different from what -- you know , cosmetic changes . \nThey need a drastic shift . \nCOOPER : Secretary Clinton talked about -- calling for a transition to democracy which they say they 've been calling for , for 30 years . \nBut if you call for 30 years and you 've seen the outcome , things getting from bad to worse , do n't you think there 's something wrong ? \nAnd do n't you think that people then will not believe that you believe in your basic values , freedom , democracy , rule of law ? \nYou really have to be -- I mean you can not change things in Egypt , but you have to stand up and make it loud and clear that you are not in fear of a dictator . \nMubarak has been supportive of the peace process . \nMubarak has been helpful in many regional issues , but they have no reason to believe that a democracy here will not be as supportive of stability . \nIt would be durable stability . \nCOOPER : When you heard that Vice President Biden said he did n't consider Mubarak a dictator , what did you think ? \nELBARADEI : Did he say that ? \nThis was days ago . \nELBARADEI : I know Joe Biden , I 'll ask him to come here for a day and let us talk . \nI 'll take him out a day in the street and talk to the people . \nIf he finds one single Egyptian saying that Mubarak is not a ruthless dictator , I 'll be surprised . \nCOOPER : And your message to President Obama is what ? \nELBARADEI : My message to President Obama -- I have lots of respect for him , I worked with him in the last year at the IAIA , and I have much admiration for him . \nBut I tell him , you need to review your policy , you need to let go of Mubarak , you need to be -- you should n't be behind the curb . \nYou need to start building confidence with the people and not with the people who are smothering the people . \nCOOPER : Are you concerned that the protesters wo n't be able to maintain , you know , their energy ; that they wo n't continue to come out every day ? \nELBARADEI : I do n't think so . \nI think they 're determined . \nI have been talking to some of the leaders today . \nI mean , I think they are not going to let go until they see the back of Mubarak frankly . \nThe earlier he would do that the better , you know , for the country . \nI -- my fear , Anderson , is that we would have more violence if that was to happen . \nCOOPER : Do you fear a crackdown by Mubarak ? \nELBARADEI : I do n't see . \nI think if they do that that would be a bloody country . \nPeople now , as you have seen , they have been empowered . \nI mean they have been beaten . \nThey are not going to stop short of change of regime , change of Mubarak . \nCOOPER : If there is a transitional government , would you run for President ? \nELBARADEI : This is not -- and again , Anderson , this is not my priority at all . \nAt my -- at this stage , all I want to see is Egypt modern , moderate , democratic . \nAnd I would be -- I would have achieved the last mission of my life , if you like . \nI always said if people want me to run , I would not let them down . \nBut that 's not my priority . \nCOOPER : Can you predict what 's going to happen ? \nI mean , do you have a sense of if Mubarak leaves , when he might do that ? \nELBARADEI : I think within the next two weeks things have to be clear . \nI think within the next two weeks if things are not clear , I am afraid that things will escalate . \nThere 's no , as I said , there 's no going down . \nCOOPER : I 'm joined now by Robin Wright , senior fellow at the Institute for Peace ; also by John King , host of `` JOHN KING , USA '' . \nJohn , what are you hearing out of the White House in terms of how they are viewing the situation here ? \nJOHN KING , CNN HOST , `` JOHN KING , USA '' : Well , on a lot of points , they actually agree with Mr. ElBaradei in that interview . \nThey think the next two weeks are critical . \nThey also think , Anderson , the next 24 hours could be critical . \nThe administration wants him to leave . \nThey 're not saying that quite publicly ; but privately , they want him to leave . \nThey 're conveying that message . \nThey do n't want him to leave in a vacuum , however . \nThey want him to work with his current newly-constituted government . \nWork with Mr. ElBaradei and other people in the protest community to form some sort of an interim relationship that would then allow a period of time for democratic institution building and democratic elections . \nBut they do believe since -- they believe , number one , Mr. Mubarak is resisting that advice and digging in , and they think tomorrow could be critical . \nIf there are huge numbers of peoples in the streets , how does the army react ? \nAnd does the army then go to the President and say , Mr. Mubarak , you need to go ? \nThat could be the key moment . \nCOOPER : And Robin Wright , in terms of a transition to democracy , it is made all the more difficult because as I said , President Mubarak has not allowed there to be democratic institutions in this country ; has not allowed there to be real legitimate opposition groups . \nROBIN WRIGHT , SENIOR FELLOW , U.S. INSTITUTE OF PEACE : And that 's such a great deal of uncertainty . \nAnd for the Obama administration , that also makes life more difficult . \nIt 's an issue of trying to also create a sense of transition beyond Egypt , in the region generally . \nYou have very nervous allies whether it 's from Saudi Arabia or Israel concerned about what Egypt 's transition might look like and what it might lead to . \nAnd what impact it would have , because Egypt , as you know , has been always the intellectual center -- the political trendsetter in the region . \nAnd so there 's a lot to think about when it comes to who are the players ? \nAnd there are so few out there . \nThere 's a kind of hysteria in Washington about the Muslim Brotherhood , which has so far managed in any election to get no more than 20 percent . \nIt does have a solid 20 percent , but it is not considered , I think among Egyptians , as the obvious alternative . \nThat 's one of the problems . \nThe Muslim Brotherhood does not have the kind of significant support . \nSo who are the players ? \nAll the political parties that have been tolerated over the years have been very small and insignificant in terms of providing the leadership . \nThis is why Egypt is so interesting right now . \nIt 's something entirely different . \nCOOPER : It is very interesting Robin ; and John to Robin 's last point , John , when you 're out with the protesters , they make -- I mean , they bend over backwards to try to explain to me and all of us that the Muslim Brotherhood is only playing a small role in this . \nAnd that it is young people who are really the ones in the forefront of these demonstrations . \nIt 's not the Muslim Brotherhood . \nIt 's not Mohamed ElBaradei . \nIt is young people . \nAnd even today we were videotaping people praying during one the demonstrations . \nWe had a number of people come up and say you make sure you understand these are just prayers . \nThis is not a sign that we are all Islamists and that this is some sort of fundamentalist demonstration . \nHow real is that fear in the White House , John ? \nThe Muslim Brotherhood is maybe 25 percent , maybe 30 percent if there is an election tomorrow . \nWhat they do fear though , is because there are no other democratic institutions , no other political parties have been allowed to form and grow , that if you did this tomorrow , if you did this in two weeks , then what would happen ? \nWho would step into that vacuum : maybe some radical elements of the Muslim Brotherhood ; maybe some other radical onus -LRB- ph -RRB- ; maybe Iran would try to interfere ; outside forces would try to interfere . \nWithout any democratic institutions beyond President Mubarak , that is the administration 's fear , which is why they hope , Anderson , that President Mubarak will get the message , turn to his Vice President and his military chief and negotiate a transitional government that brings in Mr. ElBaradei , brings in some other people from the demonstrations and then has a several month cooling off period where you organize elections . \nThat 's what they want . \nThey do n't believe at this moment President Mubarak has gotten that message . \nThe President of the United States has called him . \nThe prime minister of the U.K. has called him . \nPrime Minister Merkel has called him . \nHowever , what they would like , but they know they ca n't get is for King Abdullah from Saudi Arabia or King Abdullah in Jordan to deliver that message . \nBut it 's the domino effect Robin just spoke about , that they do n't believe the leaders who know him best , who he trusts most would deliver the `` you need to go '' message because of the domino effect it would have on them . \nCOOPER : Do we know where Mubarak would try to go and live ? \nWould he try to live in the United States ? \nRobin knows a bit more about the region than I do . \nMost people think he would not come to the United States . \nWould he go to London , where his family is ? \nWould he go elsewhere in the Middle East ? \nIf that happened , that is a giant if . \nMake no mistake , if the United States could help privately negotiate a departure for him , they would be happy to do so . \nCOOPER : Robin Wright , I appreciate you being with us . \nThese are heady days here and difficult hours ahead . \nWe 're going to continue to follow it ; John King as well . \nWe 're going to have more live from Cairo . \nWe also just want to give you an update on the massive storm that is hitting the Midwest and also the plans to be heading east . \nWe 'll have that and more from Cairo in just a minute . \nCOOPER : Even though there 's not a large organization controlling these demonstrations , there are people trying to do the best they can . \nTrying to police order , trying to keep things orderly , make sure this does n't erupt into violence . \nThere are even people who are handing out food , they 're handing out dates like these to the crowd because people spend so much time here they get hungry . \nCOOPER : And that sense of policing the crowds , self-policing is going to be critical in the hours ahead as we anticipate a massive demonstration here in Cairo , also one called for Alexandria . \nAnd again these could be critical hours in the few hours ahead . \nWe 're coming up on the 6:00 hour here . \nThe demonstration is anticipated to begin around 9:00 . \nThe rallying point is just a few blocks from where I 'm standing in Liberation Square . \nWe 're going to have complete coverage . \nLet 's check in though with Isha Sesay who has a `` 360 News and Business Bulletin '' -- Isha . \nISHA SESAY , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Thanks Anderson . \nA federal judge in Florida has ruled President Obama 's health care reform law is unconstitutional . \nThe judge ruled that Congress overstepped its authority in passing the law , because it contains a provision requiring most Americans to buy health insurance by 2014 . \nThe Justice Department says it will appeal the ruling . \nA California man has been charged with making terrorist threats after allegedly targeting a mosque in Michigan called the Islamic Center of America . \nRoger Stockholm was arrested in the mosque parking lot allegedly with a large amount of fireworks in his car . \nHe 's being held on bond . \nOil prices are spiking amid concerns about the situation in Egypt . \nThe price settled at just over $ 92 per barrel today , the highest close since October 2008 . \nAnd a massive winter storm is heading toward the United States with more than 20 states expected to get at least some of it . \nMeteorologist Chad Myers joins us now with the very latest . \nChad , just how bad is it ? \nCHAD MYERS , AMS METEOROLOGIST : Well , it 's going to get worse . \nIt 's just starting , but it will be all the way -- these warnings all the way from Boston , all the way back down to El Paso , Texas . \nAnd if you 're in this , this is the zone of snow . \nThere will be just a slight area of ice below that , south of that , about 50 miles . \nSome spots could pick up an inch of ice . \nThat will bring down power lines , trees , and the like . \nThat 's what this is . \nThat pink area there , that 's the icing going on . \nHere comes the snow , Oklahoma City tonight , Tulsa , back up through Springfield and into St. Louis , then Chicago and then finally in to Detroit . \nIt is a big storm . \nIt continues to be a big storm as we move in . \nBut the good news is , it 's a fast storm . \nThis storm will take 36 hours to go from Texas to Massachusetts . \nIf it would be 50 hours or 100 hours the snow would be much deeper . \nI 'm assuming and expecting that we 're going to see 10 to 20 inches to be the max everywhere here in this dark purple . \nBut there may be some spots higher than that . \nThe problem is not going to be so much the snow , sure obviously 15 inches of snow is a lot . \nBut if you 're south of this line , south of Scranton , south of Pittsburgh , all the way back down even into Louisville and Columbus , Ohio and Indianapolis , that 's the line of ice that could even be more problem than the snow -- Isha . \nSESAY : Oh dear , weather woes for a lot of people . \nChad Myers , we appreciate it . \nSESAY : Anderson , let me send it back to you in Cairo . \nIt sounds a world away , Isha , from where we are right now . \nWe are -- as I said , we 're about three hours away from this demonstration . \nI can tell you , I already hear protesters off in the distance , people chanting off in the distance after morning prayers . \nIt 's going to be a very interesting day here to say the least -- potentially a dangerous day , but potentially also a critical day for the future of this country . \nI hope you stay with our coverage . \nWe 'll also be on the air of course tomorrow night live from Cairo as well with all the developments on Tuesday . \nWhen we come back , though our coverage continues ; I want to show you some of the most remarkable moments that we have witnessed over the last 48 hours over this weekend . \nWe 'll be right back . \nCOOPER : Just been checking my Blackberry . \nIt looks like cell phone service is still on here in Cairo , though we have been told to anticipate a shutoff of cell phone service . \nAll Internet connections now are down . \nThe last ISP server went down a short time ago . \nAlso the train service has been cut to Cairo . \nAll efforts by the government to make -- to lessen the impact of this large demonstration , which is anticipated to start in just a few hours ; I can already hear some protesters coming from one area heading toward Liberation Square to join up with a larger group . \nThat 's the staging point just a few blocks in that direction . \nAgain , we 're going to continue to cover it , be up all day and into tomorrow night to bring you the latest information . \nWe want to take a look back at some of the most dramatic moments that we saw today , Monday here , and also some of the most dramatic moments we saw over the weekend . \nGet -LRB- EXPLETIVE DELETED -RRB- out . \nWhat the hell do you want ? \nThe first choice -- Mubarak leaves . \nThe second choice -- we die here . \nWe have no choice . \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : We hate this person . \nHe 's a little -LRB- ph -RRB- person . \nNIC ROBERTSON , CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : How do you get the President out of the country ? \nBecause at the moment he sees the demonstration -- UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : We hate Mubarak . \nROBERTSON : This is what we 're seeing that we have n't seen before as well . \nLook , `` Foreign governments , stop hypocrisy , stand for Egyptians and freedom . '' \nIVAN WATSON , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : This has been an unmistakable show of military force . \nFighter jets flying low over Cairo 's Tahrir Square , Liberation Square which has been a symbol of defiance . \nThis country 's economy , its infrastructure has come to a screeching halt . \nWATSON : Soldiers have been deployed all around the city . \nAnd the tanks are even parked here at one of the ancient wonders of the world , the Great Pyramids of Giza . \nROBERTSON : Tracer fire flying in the air . \nThe demonstrators say that 's the army firing to warn them to stay away . \nThese people would n't be out on the streets if the government was in control . \nAt the moment , much of the attention is on this , Tahrir Square , the heart of the protest movement . \nCOOPER : Are you scared to be here ? \nThere 's like millions here so what am I scared of ? \nCOOPER : They 're calling for freedom and change and justice . \nThose are the words you hear a lot . \nAnd they 're saying that their demands have n't changed , they want Mubarak out . \nElBaradei is like over there with the crowd . \nEverybody wants to get a look at him . \nWants to hear anything he might have to say . \nWhat is your message to President Mubarak ? \nELBARADEI : He should leave tonight . \nSo certainly there is no indication that the movement is in any way waning , and it seems to be getting stronger by the day . \nCOOPER : All of our correspondents and camera crews and producers and engineers here are working literally around the clock day after day to bring you the best coverage we can . \nStay with CNN online and on television for the latest coverage from Egypt . \nJoin us again on 360 tomorrow night at 10:00 p.m. Eastern . \nI 'll see you then . \n"}
{"id": "71", "time": "2011-01-31", "text": "January 31 , 2011 | By Ashley Hayes , CNN Army soldiers stand guard outside the Egyptian Museum in Cairo 's Tahrir Square on Monday , January 31 . \nEgypt 's major archaeological sites , monuments and museums were under the protection of the country 's army on Monday , according to the nation 's Supreme Council of Antiquities . \nHowever , unease persisted among Egyptologists and archaeologists , who fear some of the nation 's priceless treasures may fall victim to looters or vandals , amid unrest and uprisings fueled by what protesters see as a lack of economic opportunity , widespread poverty and pervasive corruption . \nEgypt is `` the greatest open-air museum in the world , '' said Peter Der Manuelian , the Philip J. King professor of Egyptology at Harvard University . \nHe said he and his colleagues are `` trying to stay on top of -LRB- the situation -RRB- as best we can , '' given spotty internet service in Egypt . \nFriday night , a group of `` criminals '' entered the Cairo Museum using a fire department staircase , Zahi Hawass , secretary-general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities , told CNN early Sunday . \nOnce inside the museum , they went to the Late Period gallery , Hawass wrote . \n`` When they found no gold , they broke 13 vitrines -LRB- glass showcases -RRB- and threw the antiquities on the floor . '' \nThe intruders then went back to the gallery housing artifacts from King Tutankhamun 's tomb , where they opened one showcase , broke a statue of King Tut on a panther and threw it to the ground , he wrote . \nA group also entered the museum gift shop and stole jewelry , Hawass wrote in a blog post Sunday . \nA group of `` tourist police officers '' had stayed at the museum overnight , as they were unable to leave after the curfew took effect . \n`` These officers , and many young Egyptians who were also there , helped to stop more people from entering the museum '' during the protests , Hawass wrote in the blog post -- which he faxed to Italy so colleagues there could post it on his website in the absence of internet in Egypt . \nHawass told CNN early Sunday there were nine suspects , but in the blog post he said there were 10 . \nOne of them asked the people guarding the museum for water , he said , but `` they took his hands and tied him to the door that led to the gift shop so he could not escape , '' according to the post . \nHawass told CNN that when the suspects were apprehended , authorities found the remains of two mummies and some small artifacts with them . \nHowever , he said Sunday , everything that had been damaged can be restored . \n"}

Col. Mohammad Al Khateeb . \nHalf of those demonstrated , while the remainder walked alongside or watched from the sidelines . \nAl Khateeb said there were protests in six other cities on Friday , with crowd estimates totaling about 2,200 . \nThe demonstrations in Amman were the third in as many Fridays , with protesters gathering in front of the Al Husseini Mosque to decry government policies they blame for rising prices , low wages and unemployment . \nMiddle East to follow Egypt 's lead ? \nWill unrest spread to other countries ? \nWhere does U.S. go from here with Egypt ? \nThere were also calls for Prime Minister Samir Rifai , who took office in December 2009 , to step down , and for the dissolution of parliament . \nThe Islamic Action Front , the political arm of the Jordan branch of the Muslim Brotherhood , is also asking for an `` elected government .

{"id": "182", "time": "2011-01-31", "text": "January 31 , 2011 | From Dugald McConnell and Brian Todd , CNN While some governments are trying to walk a fine line between supporting Egypt 's president and supporting protesters in that tumultuous nation , Iranian officials are taking the side of the protesters . \nBut an Iranian opposition leader is making a competing claim of solidarity with the demonstrators , pointing out that when Iran 's leaders faced a similar movement in their own backyard two years ago , they crushed it . \nIranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi on Sunday praised Egypt 's protests , according to Iran 's semi-official Fars news agency , as did the speaker of Iran 's parliament , who said the parliament and the nation support uprisings against dictatorial regimes . \n`` The time has -LRB- been -RRB- reached to overcome puppet autocratic regimes by relying on the Islamic teachings , '' said speaker Ali Larijani , according to the news agency . \nAnd Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami , a top cleric in Tehran , was quoted last week by Fars as saying , `` An Islamic Middle East is being created based on Islam , religion , and democracy with prevailing religious principals . '' \nBut Iranian opposition leader Mir Hossein Mousavi says that his 2009 mass protest movement , which was violently crushed in the streets of Tehran , was based on the same grievances as the ones now seen in Tunisia , Egypt , and Yemen . \n`` Today , the slogan of ` Where is my vote ? ' \nof the people of Iran has reached Egypt , '' Mousavi wrote on his website . \nAnd in the Egyptian government 's confrontations and clashes with protesters , he says , `` We can identify a similar pattern '' to the crackdown by the Iranian government in 2009 . \nWith Iran 's regime and Iran 's opposition both trying to identify with Egypt 's protesters , `` there are two competing narratives , '' says Afshin Molavi of the Washington-based New America Foundation , which describes itself as a nonprofit , nonpartisan public policy institute . \nAnalysts say Iran 's leaders have a strategic interest at stake in the turmoil in Egypt : It is weakening Iranian leaders ' biggest archrival in the region -- the secular , pro-Western Hosni Mubarak . \nMubarak has been an ally of the West for decades , taking the opposite position from Iran on a number of issues -- opposing Iran 's nuclear program , supporting peace with Israel , and working to prevent border smuggling of weapons to Hamas militants in Gaza , according to American diplomatic cables released recently by WikiLeaks . \n"}

'' \nRight after that , the vice president 's office said that talks with opposition parties are already under way . \nRight now , it 's 1:00 a.m. in Egypt . \nA Monday scene in Cairo 's Liberation Square may be the calm though before the storm . \nIn just a few hours , massive demonstrations billed as a `` Million-Man '' march are planned across the country . \nAnd now we 're learning the Egyptian government is shutting down , get this , shutting down all mobile phone networks in the country ahead of the march . \nAlready , essential supplies are running very , very low . \nThere have been long lines in front of bread shops , food markets , gas stations and banks are closed . \nATM machines are in the dark . \nA lack of security and lack of cash paralyzing the Egyptian capital right now . \nAnd the military , the Egyptian military is n't just guarding the streets and strategic locations . \nModern weapons are now protecting the very symbols of ancient Egypt . \nCNN 's Ivan Watson is joining us now live now from Cairo with more . \nIVAN WATSON , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Well , Wolf , on this seventh day of protests , the crowd in Cairo 's central Tahrir Square of demonstrators was bigger than Saturday 's crowd , was bigger than Sunday 's crowd , bigger than ever , in fact . \nMeanwhile , out in the streets of the Egyptian capital , we saw troops , tanks , armored personnel carriers fanning out , a dramatic increase in the amount of troops in the Egyptian in the streets of the city . \nTake a look at this report . \nWATSON -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : One of the world 's most famous landmarks now guarded by army tanks . \n-LRB- on camera -RRB- : Soldiers have been deployed all around this city , and the tanks are even parked here at one of the ancient wonders of the world , the Great Pyramids of Giza . \n-LRB- voice-over -RRB- : An army officer insisted the Pyramids are still open for tourists , but the soldiers would n't let us come any closer . \nOn Monday , the troop presence was dramatically increased in Cairo , soldiers trained to defend their country from foreign enemies now taking on the duties of largely absent police -- an effort to restore law and order in a frightened city bearing the scars of several days and nights of unrest . \n-LRB- on camera -RRB- : This is part of what has Egyptians so scared right now , a number of hotels and cabarets and casinos like this that were torched and looted in the first days of the protests . \n-LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Most of the businesses in town are still closed . \nWith the normal working day cut in half by a curfew that started at 3:00 p.m. , Egyptians had a few short hours to shop for groceries -- among those foraging for food in largely empty streets , this family from Taiwan stranded while on vacation , hoping to catch a flight out of the country on Tuesday . \nAfter a week of sweeping historic changes , some Egyptians taking it upon themselves to clean up the debris left by days of protests . \n-LRB- on camera -RRB- : There is a civic-minded dimension to this protest movement here . \nWe have come to the street , and ordinary people , they 're not being paid to do this . \nThese are volunteers , students , demonstrators who are out cleaning up the streets . \nIs somebody paying you to clean these streets ? \nISRA NASRI , EGYPTIAN PHARMACY STUDENT : No , no , no. . \nNo somebody pay me . \nNo , I 'm just -- I 'm volunteer . \nI 'm coming -- no , no , no pay , no -- no money , no. . \nWATSON : And why -- why -- why are you volunteering ? \nNASRI : Because this my country . \nI wanted to clean it . \nWATSON : What is going to happen to your country ? \nNASRI : I do n't know , but I want it to better . \nThat 's all I want , to be better and to be -- to have a good president . \nWATSON -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : After years of fear , these Egyptians are no longer afraid to repeat this simple demand : They want a better government . \nWATSON : Now , Wolf , thousands of people were in Cairo 's central Tahrir Square this evening . \nAnd their demonstration had shifted more to a sit-in . \nThey set up tents . \nThey lit campfires underneath the palm trees . \nAnd as you mentioned , the vice president giving a televised address during which he called for dialogue with opposition parties and he said , yes , I agree there are problems , questions that have to be addressed that have been raised by the youth . \nThis has been very much a youth-driven movement so far of street protests . \nBut we are also hearing from an official inside the Information Ministry telling us that the phone , the cellular phone networks are likely to be cut off in the coming hours . \nThe train links have been cut off as well . \nIt does seem like efforts by the government to try to stop or at least reduce the number of people invited to participate in what opposition groups have dubbed tomorrow 's million man march -- Wolf . \nBLITZER : I just saw your tweet on that , Ivan , that the phone systems , the cellular phone systems , the mobile phone systems in Egypt are about to be shut down to try to stop people from getting involved in that march . \nBut that -- that potentially could have the opposite effect from the Egyptian government 's perspective . \nIt could really embolden those young people especially to go out there , given how sophisticated the Egyptian mobile phone system is right now . \nWATSON : Well , what we saw was the cellular phone networks were shut down on Friday , and you had running street battles taking place between demonstrators and the police , which have now largely evaporated from the streets . \nWe do n't see them out in uniform anymore , except for a few traffic cops I saw today . \nAnd , instead now , the big rallying point has become this central square , Tahrir , or Liberation , Square . \nAnd that 's a place where people are gathering . \nAnd they 're not communicating via Facebook or Twitter or e-mail . \nInstead they 're simply handing out flyers , photocopies and that is where you will see posters that have been put up inviting people to participate starting at 10:00 a.m. local time in what has been dubbed a million man match . \nWe will just have to see what 's going to happen later on Tuesday . \nBLITZER : Ivan , we will stay in touch with you and all of our reporters in Cairo and Alexandria , elsewhere in Egypt . \nWe also have some extraordinary images just coming in showing just how tense the situation on the streets of Cairo is right now . \nThis amateur video that we 're about to show you shows a confrontation between security forces and a gathering crowd . \nShots are fired and the threat seems to subside as the crowd starts chanting the people and the army are one . \nThe U.S. has launched around-the-clock efforts to airlift , to evacuate Americans out of Egypt . \nThe State Department now saying it 's evacuated more than 1,000 people today , hopes to evacuate another 1,000 tomorrow . \nHere 's the State Department 's spokesman , P.J. Crowley . \nP.J. CROWLEY , U.S. ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE FOR PUBLIC AFFAIRS : Roughly 2,600 people have contacted by a variety of means and registered with us that they wish to leave the country . \nObviously , today we 've , kind of , put a pretty good dent in that number , but , obviously , that will -- that will go up -- will fluctuate day to day , as American citizens make their own decisions about whether to stay in Egypt or to -- to leave . \nAnd just a reminder , American citizens who have the ability to get out through commercial means are doing so at the same time . \nSo we 're a source of -- of support , but -- but , you know , there are still commercial flights coming in out of Cairo . \nBLITZER : Scrambling to keep up with the events in Egypt , the Obama administration today brought together a group of outside experts on the Middle East to discuss the situation . \nJoining us now , one of those experts , Michele Dunne of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace here in Washington . \nMichele Dunne , thanks very much for coming in . \nMICHELE DUNNE , CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL PEACE : Pleasure . \nSo this was a group of scholars , experts invited to meet with whom at the White House ? \nDUNNE : To meet with some senior officials to work on Middle East , on democracy issues and also sort of on public affairs . \nBALDWIN : Did they think they needed some outside experts ; the internal experts were n't enough ? \nIs that why they brought you and your colleagues in ? \nDUNNE : Well , not necessarily . \nBut I think they wanted to sort of run through what are the messages that they 're delivering ? \nHow do we think they 're going over ? \nDo we have suggestions for how they could better articulate the U.S. point of view ? \nBLITZER : Was there a consensus that emerged in terms of what the U.S. should do next ? \nDUNNE : I think that the outside participants thought that the administration , you know , has made progress . \nIt 's sort of gone from asking for reform and things that we 're seeing as far too little to stop these demonstrations to now talking about a transition to real democracy and then we saw even later today talking now about the need for the Egyptian government to negotiate with the opposition . \n-LRB- CROSSTALK -RRB- BLITZER : Because it was only a week ago that the secretary of state was saying that this is a stable government in Egypt and then the vice president saying Mubarak is not a dictator , which seemed to suggest to a lot of outside experts and probably inside experts that they were out of touch . \nDUNNE : That 's right . \nTheir initial statements I think were sort of far behind the curve . \nI do n't think the administration wants to be out in front of the curve of events . \nIt has no desire to be steering what 's going on in Egypt but they do want to be seen to responding to what they admit are legitimate demands by the protesters . \nBLITZER : So let me pick your brain because you 're an expert . \nYou called -- you said months ago that this was likely to happen . \nI was reading your stuff . \nAnd so what should the U.S. be doing , not a week from now or a month from now , but right now ? \nWhat should the president of the United States and the secretary of state be doing ? \nDUNNE : I mean , there are a couple of key questions now . \nOne of the key questions is whether President Mubarak is going to -- is it possible for him to stay on or not ? \nDUNNE : I think the U.S. administration does not want to be the ones calling publicly for Mubarak to step down . \nI think they think that 's somewhat unseemly , that the U.S. should n't do that , but there definitely should be high level private contacts going on with Mubarak and with others , notably the Egyptian military about how they see this shaping up and the fact they really need to respond to these protesters and not just take half-measures , for example , as Mubarak did by naming a new cabinet , which did not respond at all really to what the demonstrators are asking for . \nBLITZER : We 're hearing that the administration has decided to send a former U.S. ambassador to Egypt , Frank Wisner , probably someone you know , many of us know him , to go as a special envoy to Egypt . \nI assume he 's going to meet with President Mubarak with a special message . \nNow , President Mubarak knows Frank Wisner very well . \nHe spent a lot of time in Egypt . \nWhat do you think that special envoy 's message is going to be ? \nDUNNE : Well , I do n't know what the message is going to be , but the message itself is very important . \nAmbassador Wisner is someone who was a close friend of President Mubarak , someone trusted and liked by Mubarak and the others that he will be meeting with . \nSo that 's good . \nHe 's a reassuring presence in that respect . \nHe 's also someone who could deliver a tough message if he 's given one to deliver . \nBLITZER : Yes , and he 's been very involved in Egyptian affairs over these years since retiring from the State Department as the ambassador . \nI know he 's on the board of American University of Cairo as well . \nSo we will see what happens . \nWe will follow that . \nMichele , thanks very much for coming in . \nANNOUNCER : This is CNN breaking news . \nBLITZER : All right , we 're going to get back to what 's happening in Egypt in a moment . \nBut there 's a major development happening at the White House right now . \nDan Lothian is working the story . \nAnd , Dan , it involves the U.S. ambassador to China . \nTell our viewers what you have learned . \nDAN LOTHIAN , CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT : That 's right . \nAmbassador Huntsman we are told here by two senior administration officials that he will be stepping down . \nA hand-delivered resignation letter was sent to Mr. Obama today . \nIt takes effect on April 30 . \nNow , he has played a critical role in this relationship that the United States is forging with China . \nAnd you might recall when President Hu was here at the White House during that press conference , a reporter asked Mr. Obama about the prospects of Mr. Huntsman running against him and as a Republican candidate in 2012 . \nMr. Obama joked that I 'm sure he will be very successful in whatever his endeavors he chooses in the future . \nThe president went on to say -- quote -- `` I 'm sure that having him work with me so well will be a great asset in any Republican primary . '' \nRobert Gibbs said that it was well-known within the White House that he would be stepping down at the early part of this year . \nAnd he said ever since that became known that they have been looking at who would replace him . \nSo far , though , no word on that , Wolf . \nBLITZER : Jon Huntsman , as you say , the former governor of Utah , maybe a future Republican presidential candidate himself deciding to step down . \nA good time for him he believes to do so . \nAll right , Dan , thanks very much . \nSomeone else is closely watching the situation in Egypt right now . \nWe 're talking about Bradley Manning . \nHe 's the U.S. soldier accused of leaking the WikiLeaks cables . \nWait until you hear the link he 's now making between himself and the uprising in Egypt . \nAnd another big story in the U.S. today . \nA federal judge knocks down a key part of the health care reform law . \nSo what does it really mean ? \nOur own senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin is standing by . \nBLITZER : The situation in Egypt certainly on Jack Cafferty 's mind . \nJack is here with `` The Cafferty File '' -- Jack . \nJACK CAFFERTY , CNN ANCHOR : With Egyptian protesters hitting the streets for a week now , there 's a growing sense of frustration at the lack of response from the United States . \nMany point to that speech that President Obama made to the world in Cairo in June of 2009 . \nAt that time , he spoke about democracy and he warned that governments can not suppress the rights of the people . \nSo almost two years later , these protesters would like to know why President Obama 's not putting his money where his mouth is and openly supporting them . \nIt 's a reasonable question . \nSome in the Middle East are going even farther . \nThe Israeli newspaper `` Haaretz '' writes that Mr. Obama will be remembered as -- quote -- `` the president who lost Egypt and during whose tenure America 's alliances in the Middle East crumbled '' -- unquote . \nThe piece suggests President Obama 's been too cautious , sitting on the pence and neither embracing the despised leaders nor preaching for democracy . \nBut supporters of the administration say that abandoning a key ally in a time of crisis would damage America 's interests in that region . \nWhat kind of message would it send to our other allies in the Middle East ? \nAlso , others see Egypt as a moderate force in a region of Islamic extremists like Iran and they say Egypt has helped keep peace between Israel and the Arab world . \nMeanwhile , there are signs that after 30 years , the White House is quietly preparing for a post-Mubarak Egypt . \nOne former official told `` The Los Angeles Times '' the administration recognizes it has to be on the right side of history , and that it ca n't try to keep Mubarak in power at all costs . \nSo here 's the question : What is the role of the United States when it comes to violence and political unrest in the Middle East ? \nPost a comment on my blog -- Wolf . \nBLITZER : Jack , thank you . \nPresident Obama 's sweeping health care reform law took a big legal blow today . \nAnd the battle looks like it could all the way to the Supreme Court . \nA second federal judge has ruled that key parts of the measure are , in fact , unconstitutional . \nLet 's bring in our senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin in New York . \nIt 's a serious setback for the Obama administration although the Justice Department says it will appeal . \nJEFFREY TOOBIN , CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST : And , Wolf , what makes this decision even worse than the last one is , the one in Virginia that struck down part of the law , is this judge , Roger Vinson in Florida , said as a result of the individual mandate , the part of the law that says everyone has to buy health insurance , because he says that 's unconstitutional , he says the whole law has to go out the window . \nSo he has declared the entire law unconstitutional , everything about preexisting conditions , people staying on their -- kids staying on their parents ' health care plans until 26 , unconstitutional . \nAll of that is out the window if this ruling stands . \nBLITZER : Well , it 's going to take a long time before it reaches the United States Supreme Court . \nLet 's say it takes six months or a year . \nWhat happens in between ? \nTOOBIN : Well , that seems to be up for debate at this moment . \nThe White House held a conference call earlier this afternoon . \nAnd they said nothing changes . \nThe law remains in effect pending the appeal . \nBut in the judge 's opinion , he says that he believes that the administration will not implement the law . \nSo I think the Justice Department is going to have to go back to this judge or certainly to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals to get some clarification about what happens right now . \nBut certainly , the main point is that the United States Supreme Court is going to have to address this law sooner rather than later . \nBLITZER : And it will probably be obviously a split decision at the Supreme Court . \nWe can be sure of that . \nAll right , Jeffrey , thanks very much . \nA monster storm now barreling across account United States . \nIt has Chicago squarely in its sights . \nThat 's not all . \nThree-quarters of the country could get pounded by snow , sleet and ice . \nAnd Egypt , home of the Pyramids , looters have damaged and made off with priceless treasures already . \nSo what are they eyeing next ? \nBLITZER : The chaos in Egypt , it 's not just in Cairo . \nAlexandria also a hotbed of unrest . \nWhy lots of people are deeply worried about Egypt 's border with Gaza right now as well . \nAnd why is Bradley Manning , the man accused of leaking all the WikiLeaks cables , watching the situation in Egypt so closely ? \nA close friend of his talks to CNN . \nBLITZER : Hundreds of American citizens have started to make it out of Egypt . \nThe U.S. has begun around the clock evacuations . \nAnd officials are hoping to fly some 2,000 people to safety by this time tomorrow . \nOfficial video today shows President Mubarak meeting with his new cabinet , but there 's speculation on his whereabouts . \nSome suggesting he 's in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh reportedly convinced that he 's taken refuge , at least some people say , there . \nWe do n't know , though . \nEgypt 's chaos is certainly not confined to Cairo . \nSecurity forces are on the streets of Alexandria , the second largest city in the country , one of two locations where the so-called million man protest movement is being organized for tomorrow . \nThose massive demonstrations are planned only for -- planned to begin in just hours from now . \nLet 's go live to our senior international correspondent , Nic Robertson . \nHe 's in Alexandria . \nHe 's joining us with more . \nNIC ROBERTSON , CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : Well , Wolf , the latest here is that we 're seeing the army patrolling the streets more than they have done over the past couple of evenings . \nIt 's not clear what they 're looking for . \nWe know that the government is trying to head off this million man march by closing down the phone networks here as they did on Friday to try and thwart the big protests on Friday . \nAnd the thing that we 're seeing in this city that the demonstrators are doing differently that make it more difficult to control them is they have protests in different parts of the city . \nIt almost does n't matter which area , which neighborhood you go into . \nYou will find a protest marching down a street in one direction , then another . \nAlso gathered in the central Liberation Square , Martyrs Square in here the center of the city . \nThat square is right at the end of the rail network . \nAnd there are rumors as well the railway system will be shut down tomorrow as well to try and stop people getting into that protest . \nBut it seems that the army here is stepping up their efforts to have a better idea of what 's going on in the city where and when -- Wolf . \nBLITZER : Based on your eyewitness account , Nic , have you seen a shift in the relationship between the protesters in Alexandria and the Egyptian military ? \nForget about the police right now . \nWe 're talking about the army . \nHas there been a change over the past 24 hours ? \nROBERTSON : You know , we saw the army here just drive past this hotel about maybe eight or nine hours ago shooting a heavy caliber machine gun in the air , trying to scare protesters away from the square behind me here . \nWe have n't seen that before . \nThat was the first evidence we 've seen where the army appeared to sort of challenge the protesters on the ground , firing in the air , not firing at them . \nAnd it had the desired job of chasing them away . \nWe had n't seen that 'til now . \nBut when you talk to the people , they see the army in two very clear ways . \nThe soldiers , the low-ranking soldiers , they say , `` Those soldiers are on our side . '' \nAnd we 've seen it ourselves . \nThey 're much more friendly to the people . \nIt 's the officers , the senior officers that people here think are still loyal to President Mubarak . \nAnd they have concerns that ... BLITZER : All right . \nLooks like we just lost that satellite connection with Nic . \nBut we 'll be in touch with him . \nThe Mubarak regime certainly has cooperated with the Israelis and the United States to keep the peace . \nEgypt is counted on to keep weapons out of Gaza , which is controlled by Hamas . \nHamas viewed by the U.S. government and the Israeli government as a terror organization . \nEgypt says it has blocked dozens of border tunnels . \nTake a look at these . \nThey 're big enough to actually smuggle livestock . \nBut Israel says weapons and rocket parts still reach Gaza . \nAnd what happens if Egypt just stops policing its border ? \nThree years ago when Israel responded to rocket fire by sealing off Gaza , Palestinians blew holes in the Egyptian border fence . \nThousands of desperate people poured across while Egyptian guards simply watched . \nOf all of Egypt 's neighbors , Israel certainly must be watching with the most concern right now . \nAfter several wars , Egypt became the first Arab nation to make peace with Israel . \nThat was back in 1979 , and that peace has held ever since . \nBut Israelis right now are deeply worried about what happens next . \nLet 's go to Jerusalem . \nCNN 's Fionnuala Sweeney is joining us live . \nFionnuala , the prime minister of Israel , Benjamin Netanyahu spoke out today . \nWhat did he say ? \nFIONNUALA SWEENEY , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Well , it was the first time that a government official had gone on camera and publicly made a statement . \nHe did speak yesterday at a cabinet meeting , but he elaborated somewhat today after a meeting with the German chancellor , Angela Merkel . \nAnd he said that how Egypt handles this situation would have an impact on the security of Israel . \nAnd then he went on to draw a comparison with the revolution in Iran and said that the situation was extremely dynamic and fluid , and that led him on to directly compare what is happening in Egypt with what happened in Tehran in 1979 . \nBENJAMIN NETANYAHU , ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER -LRB- through translator -RRB- : What may develop and in fact has already developed in a number of countries , including Iran itself , is that they have oppressive regimes in the form of extremist Islam , and they certainly are suppressing human rights and trampling them into the dust . \nAnd they 're not allowing any democracy whatsoever , no freedom , no rights whatsoever . \nAnd these regimes also constitute a danger to peace and stability of all civilized people . \n-LRB- END VIDEO CLIP -RRB- SWEENEY : Well , the Israeli prime minister refusing to comment on his preference for any potential post-Mubarak situation in Egypt but essentially saying that Israel was watching the situation extremely closely and urging Egypt to open dialogue with the protesters and to allow them freedom of expression -- Wolf . \nBLITZER : I know the Israelis have a very good relationship with the new vice president of Egypt , Omar Suleiman . \nDo they want Mubarak to step down and hand over power , the Israelis ? \nSWEENEY : Well , Israel , of course , would be in favor of democracy . \nBut in terms of Hosni Mubarak , he has kept the peace for Israel , particularly around Gaza , by patrolling it very securely and doing a lot of work as far as the Israelis have been concerned . \nSo Wolf , it is a situation for Israel , better the devil you know . \nBut Benjamin Netanyahu explicitly saying he would n't go into any possible post-Mubarak situation but said that , because the situation was so dynamic and so fluid , that his fear was that if change happened too quickly without the structures in place for democracy , that that could have an impact on Israel 's security . \nBLITZER : All right Fionnuala , thanks . \nFionnuala Sweeney reporting for us from Jerusalem . \nThe army soldier suspected of telling all to WikiLeaks gets just one hour of television a day in a detention center . \nGuess what he 's watching ? \nWe 'll give you a clue , it 's Egypt . \nAnd thousands of tourists flee Egypt amid all the chaos going on . \nThe ancient treasures that lured them there in the first place may now be in danger . \nBLITZER : Now , a fascinating link to tell you about . \nWe 're learning that the U.S. army private suspected of divulging top-secret information to WikiLeaks believes he may be responsible for the protests and the unrest we 're seeing in Egypt right now . \nAnd apparently , he 's happy about it . \nOur Pentagon correspondent Chris Lawrence is joining us now with details . \nI 'm not sure it was exactly top secret , but it was secret information that he was providing , allegedly , to WikiLeaks . \nWhat 's going on here , Chris ? \nCHRIS LAWRENCE , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Wolf , we know that these WikiLeaks cables were read in Egypt . \nYou know , they concerned Egypt , went into detail about some of the messages that were being passed between the U.S. and Egyptian governments . \nAnd Private Manning , as you mentioned , you know , he has not been convicted of anything . \nBut he has been charged . \nAnd one of his friends visited him in his detention center in the brig in Quantico and says that Manning has been using his one hour a day that he 's allowed to watch TV to keep very close tabs on what he can on what 's going on in Egypt . \nDAVID HOUSE , MT RESEARCHER , FRIEND OF MANNING : That was yesterday talking to Bradley Manning . \nWe talked for 21\\/2 hours . \nAnd Tunisia and Egypt were a very large part of our conversation . \nLAWRENCE : You got a sense that he felt a real connection to what is going on there ? \nHOUSE : Talking to Bradley Manning , yes . \nEvents happening today in Egypt are exactly in line with what he views the Internet as a powerful force for , and that is a force for good , a force for democracy . \nHe views the power of social media as a force that can unite people and allow them to rapidly organize and to actually outsmart tyrannical regimes . \nThis is one reason he believed why the Egyptian government had unplugged the Internet in Egypt , in order to prevent this young educated class of people from rapidly organizing . \nLAWRENCE : And again , some of these leaked cables show that behind the scenes the U.S. State Department was supporting a pro- democracy activist there in Egypt , pushing for the release of some of the dissidents who were being imprisoned . \nSo you know , all of this was read in Egypt and looked at as a sign possibly of what support maybe they could expect from the United States government . \nBLITZER : Interesting stuff . \nAll right , Chris , thank you . \nA King Tut statue is smashed into pieces and tossed on the ground . \nLooters vandalize and steal some of Egypt 's priceless artifacts dating back thousands of years . \nAnd now Egypt 's army is stepping in to protect what some call the greatest open-air museum in the world . \nAnd military propaganda from China or an all-too-familiar movie moment . \nBLITZER : Some of the world 's most priceless treasures now facing danger in Egypt . \nLooters have already damaged a statue of King Tut and carted off ancient artifacts in the unrest boiling over in the country . \nNow many of Egypt 's museums are frightened that they could be targeted next . \nLet 's go to CNN 's Mary Snow . \nShe 's working the story for us . \nWhat do you know , Mary ? \nMARY SNOW , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Wolf , Egypt 's Supreme Council of Antiquities said that the country 's major archaeological sites , monuments and museums are now being protected by the army . \nBut there 's still a lot of concern . \nZahi Hawas -LRB- ph -RRB- , the top antiquities official , wrote in a blog this weekend , quote , `` My heart is broken and my blood is boiling '' after reporting ten looters got into the Cairo museum . \nHe and many others are hoping that national pride will protect priceless artifacts . \nSNOW -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Soldiers stand guard outside the Egyptian museum in Cairo , home to thousands of historical treasures . \nBut it has n't quelled concerns after looters entered the museum on Friday night . \nThomas Campbell is director of the New York Metropolitan Museum , which has close ties to Egypt . \nTHOMAS CAMPBELL , DIRECTOR , METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART : Anyone who 's had the privilege of visiting the museum will recognize it 's one of the most significant collections in the world . \nSo seeing damage to these artifacts is deeply troubling . \nSNOW : For many , the images were a flashback to artifacts destroyed in Iraq in 2003 . \nCAMPBELL : I think that 's the thought that went through everyone 's mind . \nSNOW : But Campbell says the situation appears to be different than what happened in Iraq . \nIn Cairo , the antiquities chief reported over the weekend , the museum was safe and that the damage was linked to a group of criminals apparently looking for gold . \nThen came images of civilians guarding the museum along with the military . \nEgyptologists like Bob Brier , who says he 's visited the museum more than 100 times , are now trying to assess the damage . \nBOB BRIER , EGYPTOLOGIST : It 's not just abstract objects . \nWe know these pieces . \nYou know , we 've stood in front of the cases and talked about them to our students , and now to see them lying on a floor smashed , it 's horrible . \nSNOW : Of the items is damaged , Egypt 's antiquities chief says looters broke 13 glass showcases . \nAmong the artifacts damaged is a statue from King Tutankhamun 's tomb dating back more than 3,000 years . \n-LRB- on camera -RRB- What are we looking at here ? \nBRIER : I 'm pretty sure I think I know what this is . \nThis is another Tutankhamun object . \nIt 's a panther . \nThe panther is over here . \nThis is the big base that it was on , and standing striding on top of the panther was Tutankhamun , showing his power ; he 's controlling the panther . \nSNOW : Despite fears for the safety of other museums and archeological sites throughout Egypt , there is hope in seeing images of civilians protecting these treasures . \nCAMPBELL : It 's extremely moving , and it symbolizes the great value that the Egyptian population place on their -- on their cultural heritage . \nThey are the guardians of a heritage that is significant for the world . \nSNOW : As you can imagine , Egyptologists are expressing concern about what 's to come in the next few days , especially at monuments , archaeological sites that are outside Cairo -- Wolf . \nBLITZER : All right , Mary , thanks very much . \nLet 's hope for the best . \nLet 's talk to two women who are just back in the United States . \nThey had been in Egypt . \nMarian Gergis and Mikaela Anderson are joining us . \nThey just landed at JFK . \nMarian , how hard was it to get out of Egypt during these tumultuous days ? \nMarian , can you hear me ? \nMARIAN GERGIS , TOURIST : I mean , me and Mikaela were pretty lucky , because we went part of a tour group so once we -- yes , I can hear you . \nGERGIS : Can you hear us ? \nBLITZER : Yes , we hear you fine , but go ahead . \nTell us how hard it was to get out . \nOnce we got to the airport , I mean , it was crazy . \nPeople were on the floor sleeping . \nPeople were on the line , just trying to get through and buy tickets just to get out of Cairo . \nBut Mikaela and I were actually pretty lucky , because we came part of , like , a tour group . \nSo they kind of just , you know , brought us in , and we checked in . \nTook us about , what , two hours to check in maybe ? \nGERGIS : About two hours to check in . \nANDERSON : Anyone who was n't in a tour group really had a difficult time , though ; not getting through . \nAnd we heard that our flight was one of the only flights flying out of the airport . \nSo we 're not sure how true that is . \nBut we got very lucky to get out . \nBLITZER : And Mikaela , did you see any of the demonstrators , the protesters while you were there ? \nI know you were in Cairo and then you went to Luxor . \nWhat did you see ? \nWell , when we were flying back to Cairo to , you know , take part of our tour , we got trapped at the airport , because they were having curfews . \nSo we were stuck there till about 2 in the morning . \nThen they had to transfer us to a different hotel , because we were staying at Safir , I believe , Hotel about two blocks from the museum . \nSo we lucked out . \nWe were n't in the middle of it , but we stayed at the Radisson Blue instead . \nAnd there were some locals out there that were standing guard with , you know , large sticks , metal rods , bats , blockading the streets . \nJust , we -- you know , they were taking precautions , thinking they might do damage . \nSo they kept everyone in hotel rooms , telling us not to leave . \nBut it appeared they were just protecting their property from anyone who might be looting . \nBLITZER : Well , we 're happy you guys are back . \nI 'm sure your families are a lot happier than we are . \nThanks for coming in , Marian Gergis and Mikaela Anderson . \nShould the U.S. take a more active role in what 's happening in Egypt and the Middle East ? \nYou 're telling what you think to Jack Cafferty . \n`` The Cafferty File '' coming up . \nAnd China shows off its military might . \nWhy is it more like the scene from a Hollywood blockbuster , literally ? \nBLITZER : Let 's get right back to Jack for `` The Cafferty File '' -- Jack . \nJACK CAFFERTY , CNN ANCHOR : The question this hour , Wolf , is : `` What is the U.S. role when it comes to violence and political unrest in the Middle East ? '' \nLou writes , `` There 's always been conflict in the Mideast . \nWe will continue to be affected by it as long as we are so dependent on their oil . \nOur Sputnik moment should be making a car that can run on anything but oil . \nThink of the peace we could have if we were n't always trying to pacify some oil-rich dictator . '' \nPete in Georgia says , `` To stay out of their business . \nWe 've spent billions and billions of dollars on corrupt governments all over the world , and for what ? \nThe people of these countries know nothing of our generosity , do n't care about it , and in the end up , they wind up hating us , regardless . '' \nP. in Pennsylvania writes : `` The U.S. should be very careful not to choose sides but support a more democratic government that gives the people more rights and freedom than they have now . \nThe U.S. has to walk a fine line when doing this . \nIt 's sort of like an outsider getting involved in a family argument . \nYou have to watch what you say or do or the whole family 's likely to turn against you . '' \nJ.D. writes , `` The role of the U.S. is -- in an unstable Middle East is to be the right side of history . \nThese days being on the right side of history means giving moral support to a down-trodden populace , trying to oust a ruthless dictator , while at the same time , giving that dictator financial support to maintain a military for the purpose of putting down his enemies . \nIt 's a brilliant policy , really , in its simplicity . \nBeing on both sides of history always guarantees that you 'll come out on the right side . '' \nKathy writes , `` It 's long past time for us to stop sticking our noses into everyone else 's business . \nHow would we feel if another country tried to interfere in our affairs ? '' \nPeter in Terrytown , New York , sums it up this way . \n`` It 's time for the U.S. to fish or cut bait . \nEither we support democracy , civil and human rights , and we oppose dictatorial countries , or we do n't . \nWe have the opportunity now to back the citizens of Egypt or look like hypocrites . \nWhat do we stand for if we do n't support the citizenry of Egypt now ? '' \nBLITZER : I think a whole bunch of leaders in the Middle East are pretty nervous right now , seeing what 's -- what 's happened in Tunisia , what looks like could happen in Egypt . \nIf you 're a leader of one of those countries , you 're getting a little antsy . \nCAFFERTY : Well , there 's some stirrings , apparently , in Jordan , correct ? \nCAFFERTY : And little noises being made here and there . \nAnd yes , I mean , these are all a bunch of iron-fisted folks who do n't allow their people a whole lot of room to do much of anything . \nAnd if they see Mubarak go , what is it , the old Shakespeare line : `` He who wears the crown sleeps uneasily at night '' ? \nI butchered that pretty good , but it 's something like that . \nBLITZER : Something like that . \nJack , I 'll see you tomorrow . \nBLITZER : We have some very sad news to share with our viewers tonight . \nA really beloved and talented cameraman and a good friend of ours , Jerry Thompson , died over the weekend after a battle with brain cancer . \nHe worked here at CNN for more than 25 years , covering some of our most important stories . \nMany of the viewers may not know his name but have literally watched history from Jerry 's shoulder . \nHe was a quiet pro who was always determined to get it right . \nThrough his gifted eye and steady hand , he took beautiful pictures and was a key part in many of the news events that we 've covered . \nHe leaves behind his loving wife , Inez , and their three sons . \nOur hearts and prayers go out to Jerry Thompson 's family . \nWe will miss him . \nBLITZER : Here 's a look at today 's `` Hot Shots . '' \nIn Guatemala , indigenous people take part in a Mayan ritual to commemorate their civil war . \nIf Kazakhstan , assistants prepare for an awards ceremony at the Asian Winter Games . \nIn Paraguay , a cowboy rides a bull during a traditional festival . \nAnd outside of a mall in Beijing , a little girl stands next to a statue representing the year of the rabbit . \n`` Hot Shots , '' pictures worth a thousand words . \nChinese propaganda or a `` Top Gun '' movie moment ? \nCNN 's Jeanne Moos has this `` Most Unusual '' blast from the past . \nJEANNE MOOS , CNN CORRESPONDENT -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Take off those sunglasses , Tom Cruise , and look where you may have ended up . \nChina 's state television , CCTV , was showing a training drill . \nChinese fighter planes doing maneuvers . \nBut someone online noticed that missile strike looked awfully familiar . \nMOOS : That sure looks like the final dogfight in the movie `` Top Gun . '' \n`` OMG , Tom Cruise has defected , '' said one post . \nThe `` Wall Street Journal '' grabbed the footage before it was taken down from the CCTV Web site and slow-mo 'd it to show the debris patterns matched . \nMaybe CCTV just needed a glitzy shot fast . \nTOM CRUISE , ACTOR : I feel the need -- the need for speed ! \nMOOS : CCTV did not feel the need for speed when we asked for comment , but gave a `` no comment '' to others . \n-LRB- on camera -RRB- `` Top Gun '' backfiring on the Chinese reminds us of another doctored missile photo that blew up on the Iranians . \n-LRB- voice-over -RRB- Iran 's revolutionary guard 's Web site first published a shot of four missiles going up . \nThen bloggers noticed one of the four seemed to be a composite of the others . \nThe Iranians later updated the shot , showing three missiles . \nOne theory was they put in an extra missile to cover up a dud . \nAt the time , CNN did its own demo . \nSmoke from the bottom of another missile over here , which it looks like they did , because this cloud matches over here . \nAnd then you just grab up here , some of the missile there and you sort of add that in . \nMOOS : Even if it does n't add up , these days you ca n't believe your eyeballs , even when they 're seeing great balls of fire . \nRemember , you can always follow what 's going on in THE SITUATION ROOM on Twitter . \nYou can get my tweets , @WolfBlitzerCNN , all one word . \nYou can also follow THE SITUATION ROOM on Facebook . \nI 'm Wolf Blitzer in THE SITUATION ROOM . \n`` JOHN KING USA '' starts right now . \n"}

TRANSCRIPT . \nKYRA PHILLIPS , CNN ANCHOR : OK . \nIt 's the top of the hour , and it 's Monday , 10:00 a.m. in the east , 14 minutes to sunrise in San Francisco , right now we 're watching the midwest in that dangerous winter storm that could bury old snow records in St. Louis and Chicago . \nThe system could trigger tornadoes in the south and it could batter the east cost by Thursday . \nThen near Seattle , a vigil for a corrections officer found dead in a prison chapel . \nIt 's believed that an inmate serving life for rape and assault strangled her as she was trying to escape . \nThe victim , Jamie Vindal was the only guard working in the chapel . \nThe superintendent said she did n't even carry a weapon , the inmate is now in an isolated unit and has asked for a lawyer . \nAnd the government 's new dietary guidelines out today , if you love sugar , salt and big sticks of margarine , you 're out of luck , the fed say cut that out . \nEat more seafood , fruits and

\nMeanwhile , the man who has become the face of that movement says Mubarak 's fall seems inevitable . \nMOHAMED ELBARADEI , NOBEL PEACE LAUREATE -LRB- via phone -RRB- : I will continue to participate in whatever it takes to make sure that the Mubarak regime should leave . \nI think that 's a - that is a consensus here in Egypt , in every part of society that this is a regime that is dictatorial , that has failed to deliver on economic , social or political fronts , and that we need a new beginning in Egypt that is free and that is democratic , and we need to go through a transitional period . \nPHILLIPS : But on the seventh day of protests , some stark realities hitting home . \nFood shortages becoming commonplace . \nPeople waiting in lines for hours to buy bread . \nStore shelves becoming empty . \nLawlessness reaching a new level as well . \nPrisons empty with murderers , rapists , terrorists running free . \nAnd a show of brazen defiance , citizens then looted those prisons themselves . \nNow all eyes remain on the country 's military on what role it 's going to play in the uprising . \nFighters igniting fear and rumors yesterday when they buzz crowds of protesters and some people felt panicked because they thought they were about to be bombed . \nNow out of the chaos , Mohammed Elbaradei is emerging as a leading figure of the opposition . \nThe name might sound familiar . \nHe used to head up the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency . \nAnd yesterday , he joined the crowds in Cairo 's -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- Square . \nA move that energized many of those protesters . \nOur Fred Pleitgen was right there earlier this morning . \nAnd he told us what he saw at street level . \nFREDERICK PLEITGEN , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Police forces absolutely vanished off the street here . \nThere is some talk that it might return today . \nWe 're not exactly sure that 's going to be the case but simply that 's something that is really being discussed and is the talk of the town . \nThat could actually spur new unrest , because it was the heavy-handedness of the police that caused the riot here last Friday . \nBut right now , there 's no police present . \nI was going around Cairo yesterday , in the suburbs , and we went past seven or eight police stations , which all of them had been abandoned , looted and burned down . \nThere is an air of lawlessness where a lot of people are defending their own homes with everything they can find from samurai swords to clubs to rifle . \nSo right now there is n't much in the way of any law enforcement authority . \nAnd the ones that are sort of trying to keep order is the military . \nPHILLIPS : Well , the U.S. is evacuating Americans who want to escape that turmoil in Egypt . \nAnd U.S. citizens are gathering now in Cairo 's main airport . \nThe first charter flight has already taken off . \nThe evacuees will be responsible for the costs of their flights , and according to the State Department , there are about 52,000 Americans registered with the embassy in Cairo . \nSo far , 2,400 Americans have already been asked to evacuate . \nNow , for those who want to stay , the State Department is urging them to limit their movements , and keep a close eye on this escalating crisis . \nNow Lara Getz is one of 35 students who got caught up in the Egypt unrest . \nShe and her Tulane classmates have been waiting for the call that says they can go home . \nLaura joins me on the phone from Alexandria , Egypt . \nSo Lara , describe what you 've seen and what it 's been like for you ? \nLARA GETZ , STRANDED STUDENT : Well , first of all , I should probably clarify that I 'm just one student from Tulane . \nWe 're a group of about 20 different students from different programs here , but it 's been a really , you know , extraordinary and pretty life-changing experience . \nYou know , right know , we 're waiting to get out , but you know , starting on Friday we were able to see the Egyptian people finally stand up to a government that 's been extremely oppressive for about 30 years now and you know , take to the streets in a unified effort , despite the president 's efforts in limiting that . \nI mean , he cut off the internet . \nHe cut off all mobile services , so there 's no communication among people and yet everyone 's still banded together . \nIt has , you know , been a mixture of experiences . \nIt has been frightening at times , since it 's been getting violent between people looting and you know , some of the criminals getting out . \nSo , you know people running around . \nPeople have weapons now , but what has been really extraordinary as well has been to see how the Egyptian people have really united over all of this , and that , you know , in the neighborhoods we have been seeing people - we know people who are pretty much setting up watches and guards , and having people from all different walks of life , professors , street shop owners , young people , to like an 80-year-old man coming down and guarding their buildings and their friends and families and neighborhoods . \nSo , you know , on the one hand you see , yes , it 's become violent and it 's unfortunately come to this state , and the president has refused to step down . \nOn the other hand , you 've also seen a people really unite and show that they can really work together . \nPHILLIPS : Lara , you 've been mixing with college students since you 've been there , with other college students and you know , the average age is 20-something , 30-something , the younger generation that 's out there in protest . \nWhat have fellow college students there been telling you , as you talk about , even before this , as you talk about the politics and the life ? \nI mean , for the most part , have they all appeared to be anti- Mubarak ? \nOr have you found that there are students in support of his government ? \nGETZ : Obviously - this program has had a unique opportunity to really get to know the Egyptian youth themselves . \nAll of us have a lot of Egyptian friends . \nAnd so obviously , you know , we 've seen a wide range of people , but really the majority of them know that it 's type for Mubarak to step down . \nHe 's been extremely oppressive . \nThey all want something better . \nThey all want a better life for their family , for their friends , for their country . \nAnd so , you know , it has been incredible . \nThings that quite honestly , as a lot of people led up to the 25th and to Friday , you know - I 'm not sure how many people are expecting this to actually happen among the Egyptians and American students that I know . \nPHILLIPS : Real quickly , do you know how you 're going to get out of there , Lara ? \nDo you have any idea ? \nGETZ : We do . \nRight now , we have a couple different plans and we 're just waiting to see which one is the best option . \nOne of the problems has been that most of the evacuation efforts , actually almost all evacuation efforts have been focused on Cairo , and we 're in Alexandria . \nSo we 've been pretty much working with different people in the U.S. and in Egypt to help get evacuation efforts from Alexandria , which is now beginning to work . \nPHILLIPS : Well , you keep us posted , Lara . \nWe want to stay in touch with you . \nThank you so much for calling in . \nLet 's take a quick check of the big board right now . \nIt looks like the Dow Industrials up 10 points . \nOverseas markets are shaky , of course , because of the turmoil in the Middle East . \nWe 'll keep watching the numbers for you and what it means for you . \nNow the instability is not just hanging over Wall Street , it 's also rippling to your corner gas station . \nSome analysts say that if Egypt remains in turmoil we could see oil prices more than double . \nStephanie Elam , that is not going to make commuters happy . \nSTEPHANIE ELAM , CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT : No , it 's not exactly the Valentine 's day present anyone is hoping for around here , Kyra . \nThis is what everyone is keeping their eyes on , is exactly how far this unrest is going to go . \nCould it potentially affect the Suez Canal because it affect the Su-Med pipeline ? \nThis is really important . \nBecause they actually are in Egypt 's control . \nHowever , a lot of the world 's oil makes their way through this . \nSo here you have on this one graphic here that the red line , which would be the Suez Canal and then yellow line , which is the Sumed pipeline . \nWe should not that that pipeline has 1.8 million barrels a day that flowed through it . \nIn 2009 , at 1.8 million flowed through the Suez Canal . \nSo those two arteries are key to getting oil out . \nBecause if those two did n't exist , Kyra , then they would have to ship it all the way around Africa , and that 's an extra 6,000 miles . \nSo no one wants to do that , because obviously it 's more expensive , and on top of it . \nIt would really cut into supply here if we had to do that . \nSo that would just take a lot longer to do and would affect how this oil gets to everybody else . \nBecause as we know , a lot of the Middle East producers supply to a lot of the world . \nNow , at this point I do need to say that there could be delays at the Suez Canal . \nThere maybe some delays now but it 's not because of issues as far as the canal is concerned . \nWhat we are hearing is that the issues are communications because we know a lot of the communications abilities were shut down because of the unrest . \nSo shippers are having a hard time . \nThe cal itself , the pipeline itself , are very much in control . \nSo right now , we 're seeing that displayed even in oil prices , which did top 90 bucks in overnight trading but have come back a little bit . \nSo it does n't look like anything crazy right now , but again that could change on a dime when you see what exactly has gone on with oil just this month , Kyra . \nPHILLIPS : All right , we 're going to keep tracking it . \nThat major blizzard that we 've been talking about with possible record-setting cold and snow , is moving into the midwest . \nRob Marciano is watching it second by second for us . \nROB MARCIANO , AMS METEOROLOGIST : Yes , it 's really starting to come together . \nWe have a number of ingredients and it 's going to be multi-day event , Kyra and it 's going to be a multistate event and it 's going to be multi-headaches . \nI can tell you that . \nWe 've got snow , cold air , so frigid cold temperatures , blizzard conditions expected in Chicago , a ribbon of ice from New York City all the way back through northern Texas . \nAnd then down to the south , thankfully no snow or ice in the deep south , but enough heat and energy that we built up over the weekend to probably spawn some severe thunderstorms tomorrow and again on Wednesday . \nSo big storm and big headaches . \nWe got winter storm watches that have been posted from New England all the way down to New Mexico . \nSo over 2,000 miles of linear real estate there , and tens of millions of people affected by this thing . \nAnd we could see anywhere from places like Chicago , you could see 12 to 18 inches of snow . \nIf that happens , and I 'm pretty confident we 're going to have at least a foot . \nIf they get 18 inches or 20 inches that would be the biggest snowstorm that they have seen in over 10 years . \nSo a big deal , no doubt about it . \nWe got a bit of rain across parts of the southeast . \nThis is causing some travel delays across Atlanta , just kind of a precursor of the main storm . \nMinneapolis also seeing some snow right now . \nThat 's driving down into Chicago , but this is the main event here , or the main piece of energy that 's really going to be driving down into Texas . \nAnd as that happens , everything is going to begin to take shape with this system . \nAnd we 're going to start to see it wind up fairly rapidly . \nI mentioned Atlanta got some delays , Houston , some delays as well , and Minneapolis because of the snow that 's limiting visibility right now , a couple of inches on the ground from this particular storm . \nLet 's go through where this storm is going to be and what time . \nWe start it today , and we go through the next 24 hours . \nOklahoma through parts of eastern Kansas is going to get hammered with snow and wind tomorrow . \nBlizzard conditions expected in Chicago , again a foot and a half potentially and the wintry mix nosing into the northeast , several inches of snow and ice expected there through Thursday . \nGoing to be quite a week . \nHold on to your hats . \nPHILLIPS : All right . \nYou 've heard of krab , with a `` k , '' right ? \nIs it really crab ? \nIt never had claws or legs . \nWe want to know , what other foods are out there that sounds genuine ? \nYou might even fool your taste buds , if you really think about it . \nPHILLIPS : Well , the stars came out for the Screen Actors Guild last night . \nAnd the `` King 's Speech , '' `` The Fighter '' and `` Boardwalk Empire '' are some of the big winners . \n`` Showbiz Tonight '' host A.J. Hammer is watching all these for us . \nIt 's good to see you back . \nI missed you last week . \nDid you see `` The King 's Speech '' ? \nA.J. HAMMER , HOST `` SHOWBIZ TONIGHT '' : You know what , I still have n't seen it ? \nI ca n't believe I 'm saying that . \nI have a whole pile of movies to get to before the Oscars . \nPHILLIPS : A.J. , you 've got to see this movie . \nHAMMER : I 'm on it . \nWell , last night , Kyra , I 'm here to tell you `` The King 's Speech '' absolutely ruled and it was Betty White who reigned last night at the Screen Actor 's guild in Los Angeles . \nNow `` The King 's Speech '' won two awards , including the big one , outstanding performance by a cast in a motion picture . \nColin Firth got outstanding male actor for playing King George VI in a movie , `` Black Swan 's '' Natalie Portman and `` The Fighter '' co-stars Christian Bale and Melissa Leo were also honored with 12 pound , 16 - inch high trophies called `` The Actor . '' \nOver the TV side , `` Boardwalk Empire '' and `` Modern Family '' won the awards for outstanding performance by an ensemble in a drama and comedy , respectively . \nHAMMER : Well , 89-year-old Betty White beat out `` Glee 's '' Jane Lynch and `` 30 Rock 's '' Tina Fey for favorite TV funny woman in a comedy series for her role in `` Hot in Cleveland . '' \nDo you see the look in her face ? \nShe looked absolutely shocked , and no surprise , Betty brought down the house . \nBETTY WHITE , ACTRESS : But to have this happen on top of -- oww ! \n-- on top of everything else , I can not say thank you enough . \nHAMMER : Now , this was White 's first S.A.G. award , Kyra . \nShe called the win the biggest surprise of her career when you think about how many decades , multiple decades , Betty White has had a career , that 's a pretty big statement . \nPHILLIPS : She 's a piece of work . \nCan you believe she 's 89 years old ? \nPHILLIPS : Yes and she 's still got it . \nSo clearly it was a night of big stars , and big winners , but one huge TV star was noticeably absent . \nHAMMER : Yes , the guy with the biggest show on TV as far as sitcoms are concerned . \nWe 're talking about Charlie Sheen , of course . \nAnd that 's because he checked himself into rehab once again on Friday . \nThat 's basically shut down production of his hit sitcom `` Two and a Half Men , '' for the second time in a year . \nHis publicist telling `` Showbiz Tonight '' Charlie voluntarily entered an undisclosed rehabilitation center , and CBS and Warner Brothers Television tell us , `` We are profoundly concerned for his health and well being and support his decision . '' \nNow the announcement that he 's seeking treatment came a day after Charlie was hospitalized with what his publicist had called severe abdominal pains late last week . \nAn ambulance was called to Sheen 's Beverly Hills home , that was early Thursday , amid all these reports of wild party with porn stars , Charlie will reportedly be in rehab for at least , the next three months . \nAnd that leaves the production status of `` Two and a Half Men '' in limbo for the time being . \nBut while Charlie is headed into rehab , some pretty good news about celebrities who have finished up their time in treatment . \nDisney star Demi Lovato left the treatment center that she voluntarily entered three months ago . \nShe has returned to her home in Los Angeles , according to a source close to her family . \nLovato dropped out of a world tour with the Jonas Brothers and sought help for emotional and physical issues back in early November . \nThat was after some kind of an altercation with a dancer on her concert tour . \nLittle information has been made public about Demi 's issues , but a statement by her publicist in November described them as emotional and physical issues that she 's dealt with for some time . \nAnd the publicist had cautioned at that time against describing the treatment as rehab . \nSo good to see her out , hopefully on the right path , Kyra . \nPHILLIPS : All right . \nAnd if you want information on everything breaking in the entertainment world , A.J. has always got it for you . \nEvery night , `` Showbiz Tonight '' 5:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m. on HLN . \nWell , beefy , cheesy , chocolatey , how do you know if you 're eating the real thing ? \nThe beef with Taco Bell 's beef had us talking this morning . \nAnd of course we 're keeping an eye on Egypt . \nThe situation there so volatile right now . \nCNN correspondents are all over the region witnessing the action right there on the ground and from the air . \nIVAN WATSON , CNN CORRESPONDENT -LRB- on camera -RRB- : This is an unmistakable show of military force . \nFighter jets flying low over Cairo 's Tahrir -LRB- ph -RRB- Square , Liberation Square . \nThis has been as symbol of defiance . \nPHILLIPS : Well , it 's one big step . \nA couple of long-distance runners will never forget taking . \nTheir story tops our look cross country . \nMolly Johnston and David Upton not only ran the 26 miles of Houston 's Chevron marathon yesterday , but they took a matrimonial side trip . \nThey actually tied the knot during the race . \nAs they crossed the finish line , another journey was just starting . \nDAVID UPTON : -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- the only way I was going to marry here -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- . \nMOLLY UPTON , MARATHON NEWLYWEDS : It 's been five years . \nPHILLIPS : We got another love story with good fortune . \nThis one for a homeless couple from Green Bay , Wisconsin . \n-LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- and her boyfriend won an all-expense paid trip to this Sunday 's showdown in Dallas , compliments of the city 's visitors and convention bureau which held a secret phrase contest that Ouida read about on-line . \nOUIDA WRIGHT , WON TRIP TO SUPER BOWL : And I said , have you to Dallas lately ? \nAnd he said , oh yes , I have . \nAnd I said `` Are you the contest guy ? '' \nYes , I am . '' \nCan you imagine a homeless person who ca n't afford a movie gets to go to the Super Bowl ? \nPHILLIPS : Well , a lot of people are asking why do n't they just sell that trip , bank the proceeds and look to their future , but it 's Green Bay , Wisconsin , and they 're Packer fans . \nThat 's all I have to say . \nMotorists in downtown Indianapolis need to be careful around the intersection of Massachusetts Avenue in New Jersey street after five manhole covers literally flipped their lids . \nFirefighters investigating a report , a smell of natural gas from those manhole started popping . \nOne fire truck and nearby building were damage . \nLocal gas company says , `` no. -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- manholes do n't appear to be natural gas related . \nWe want to talk more about that beef with Taco Bell . \nThe company has got its call of - well in a big chalupah . \nSorry , I missed that one . \nThe plaintiffs claim that the company 's beef is really less than 35 percent real - the other 65 percent , well , a mix of water , chili pepper and other stuff , including my personal favorite , yeast extract . \nA top company executive says bring it on , the beef claim is bogus and that the food starts with 100 percent USDA inspected beef and that the finished product is about 88 percent beef . \nNow the rest is the stuff that gives the food a flavor . \nHe 's also promising a counter - suit . \nLet 's bring in Kat Kinsman . \nShe 's the managing editor of CNN 's `` Eatocracy , '' food blog . \nNow Cat did I get that right . \nIt is the chalupahs . \nIs that one of the - I have n't been to Taco Bell in a long time . \nDid I say that right ? \nOh , you 're missing out if you have n't been to Taco Bell for a while . \nI think they 're mostly focusing on the taco meat -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- . \nPHILLIPS : I almost said Chihuahua . \nThat would not have been good . \nI would have gotten in big trouble . \nKAN KINSMAN , EATOCRACY.COM : Not so much . \nPHILLIPS : All right . \nSo regardless of who wins this beef battle there 's a teachable fast-food moment here , right ? \nKINSMAN : There certainly is , and really it comes down to three words - read the label . \nAll the information is out there , easy for you to find , it 's on the web site , two clicks away . \nYou 're nuts if you 're looking to Taco Bell to regulate your health at this point . \nJust empower yourself , like in what you 're eating . \nPHILLIPS : Let 's talk about the beef and the chicken , and how do we know - you say read the label , but come on , a lot of us really do n't do that . \nWhat 's the reality check , if a taco is 89 cents we should know it 's not , you know , a certain kind of beef , if the chicken is at a certain price . \nBecause I mean , you know , we do want the real thing , but there 's a lot of marketing ploys out there . \nKINSMAN : There 's a huge difference between cheap food and inexpensive food . \nAnd it just takes educating yourself a little bit to know the difference . \nIn fact today the USDA was releasing new guidelines on what Americans should be eating . \nAnd that just really comes down to personal responsibility . \nAgain , you look for words that you understand . \nHow much salt is in there , how much actual beef is in there , just - if you do n't understand what a word is , take some time out and look it up . \nIt 's the most important thing you 're going to do for your health , so why not take that little bit of time to do it . \nWords like cheesy and even blueberry are not necessarily regulated by the FDA , so you know , marketers will go with terms like chocolatey , beefy . \nI always do n't trust that `` y '' at the end of something because it means it 's like something but is n't something . \nSo again , just go to the label and look for those words . \nLEMON : Got it . \nLemon flavored , chocolate flavored , made with real - that 's interesting . \nWhen they say made with real , dot dot dot ? \nKINSMAN : Oh , it 's crazy . \nYou see a lot of things , made with real juice . \nThat can mean that whatever juice it is that you 're drinking only has been 10 percent actual fruit juice in it . \nYou know , I do n't know about you , but if I 'm drinking juice , I want to be drinking juice , not just added sugar and water . \nAnd again , those new guidelines that are coming out today are telling you that you really should be cutting down on all of that added sugar , on added salt , and it 's really just up to people to take care of their own well-being . \nIt 's not that hard , and it 's all right out there . \nPHILLIPS : Good advice . \nKat Kinsman , a managing editor of CNN 's Eatocracy . \nIf you have n't seen it in our web site . \nCNN `` Eatocracy , '' go right to it with all kinds of good advise . \nPHILLIPS : Well the situation in Egypt so volatile right now that things can change in an instant . \nWe 've seen it protesters are defying the curfew , thugs are roaming the streets with machetes and home-made weapons and with little to no police force , well , people there are forced to protect their homes and belongings however they can . \nFirsthand account , live from Cairo is next . \nPHILLIPS : Well , stock market opening ball just about an hour ago . \nLet 's check the numbers . \nDow Industrials up 24 points . \nThe uprising in Egypt may be causing ulcers on Wall Street . \nStocks opened higher just about an hour ago , but investors remain cautious about Egypt . \nLet 's go live now to Stephanie Elam in New York . \nSo , Steph , Egypt not a big oil producer , but there are definitely concerns over the disruptions to tanker shipments going through the Suez Canal . . \nWe talked a lot about this with Zain Verjee out of London . \nIt 's definitely something we 're watching . \nSTEPHANIE ELAM , CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT : Yes , it 's something everyone will be watching , especially on Wall Street because it could impact us . \nRight now , it does look like things are controlled . \nWhen you take a look at the Suez Canal , though , it is so , so important . \nSimply because if it were n't for the Suez Canal and the Sumed Pipeline , which is just to its west , then you would have to ship it all the way around Africa , which would be an extra 6,000 miles you 'd have to add to the shipment . \nSo , the fact that these two arteries are in Egypt has made people watch . \nBut overall , things have looked like they 've been controlled . \nEgypt is saying that everything is controlled at the Suez Canal , that there are no issues . \nShippers may see some delays , but that 's because of communication issues . \nThose are those two arteries , the yellow one and the red . \nThe Suez Canal is the red one . \nThey 're very , very key . \nAs you can see there , 1.1 million barrels coming through the Sumed Pipeline , 1.8 barrels going through the Suez Canal . \nSo , very important . \nBut right now , based on what we 've been seen , oil has gone up over 90 dollars a barrel overnight , but pretty much holding steady there . \nThat 's that trip around Africa that would add that extra 6,000 miles , which no one wants . \nThat would really mess with supply and demand . \nSo , all in all , we are keeping an eye on it . \nIt could change , but right now , it does seem like things are controlled as far as this is concerned in Egypt . \nIf that were to change , then that would be something that could affect the markets again here like we saw happen on Friday , Kyra . \nPHILLIPS : All right . \nAnd let 's switch to another subject , Democrats announcing an aviation bill this afternoon . \nThey say this would mean more jobs . \nWhat 's your take on that ? \nThey 're selling this as completely about the jobs . \nThe Democrats in the Senate say they 'll take to the floor today . \nIt 's really about $ 8 billion that they 're saying would actually help out with the airports , get this money to the FAA so that they can improve the infrastructure of airports , and golly , do n't we know some airports that could use some of that fundage . \nBut they 're pointing to an American Association of Airport Executives estimate , which says that these construction funds would play the part in 280,000 jobs . \nNow , they 're saying it would n't create the jobs necessarily . \nSome of these jobs could already exist , but they 're saying it would help keep some of these jobs around . \nA lot of construction jobs here as well . \nThey 're saying the airline industry accounts for about 11 million U.S. jobs , they would like to see more of that happening . \nNow , if this bill sounds familiar , it was taken to the Senate floor last spring , and it did pass 93-0 was the vote there , but then later stalled because of some side issues involved . \nThe Senate Democrats are now saying this could get through more easily this go - around , but they 're really pushing it in this $ 8 million really as they 're fixing up the infrastructure they will actually be able to create jobs and keep some jobs basically . \nThey 're very careful how they want to word that , but hoping this will help out some of the cities across the nation . \nIt 's about 10:30 now in the East , 7:30 out West . \nHistory-making winter storm about to hammer the Midwest . \nIt could impact 100 million people before it 's all over . \nChicago , St. Louis could see new snow records . \nAnd that storm could spin off tornadoes in the South . \nThe East Coast could see it by Thursday . \nAnd ready to roll . \nA little more than nine hours from now , workers at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida will begin moving the space shuttle Discovery to the launching pad . \nThe February 24 liftoff will be Discovery 's last . \nDiscovery crew will deliver a module and spare parts to the International Space Station . \nWell , you have seen the images . \nThe protesters , their faces , but who are they ? \nWell , they are young , the median age in Egypt is 24 . \nAnd many are highly educated with advanced degrees . \nDespite that , they are unemployed or underemployed . \nAccording to the U.N. , Egypt 's per capita income is $ 1,800 a year . \nThe official unemployment rate last year was 9.7 percent , but experts say the real jobless rate is significantly higher . \nAll of those factors created a volatile situation , one that my next guest is watching very closer . \nDina Amer lives in Cairo . \nShe grew up there , and it 's her generation that has flooded the streets of Cairo . \nShe 's a freelance journalist working with CNN this week . \nAnd Dina , just to tell our viewers , you actually interned for us a number of months ago . \nYou did an incredible job , you graduated college , one of the smartest we have ever seen . \nAnd you were back home , visiting your parents in Cairo where you grew up . \nYou were in London working , and it 's amazing how this all happened in just a couple days . \nBut for you as an up-and - coming journalist , this is giving you real-life experience . \nWhen has it been like for you and your family ? \nDINA AMER , FREELANCE JOURNALIST -LRB- via telephone -RRB- : Hello , Kyra . \nThank you very much , first , for saying all those lovely things about me . \nIt was a pleasure to work with you . \nBut I mean , this has been surreal . \nI mean , I would n't think in my wildest dreams I would be present here in Cairo while all this was happening . \nAnd I would be able , as a journalist , to take upon myself to experience this not only professionally , but personally , because my family is here , and I am also very emotionally affected . \nThere are many events unfolding around me , and it 's all very surreal in that aspect . \nI think that the most important -- PHILLPS : What 's -- what 's it like at home , Dina ? \nI think you mentioned that your brother has been outside sort of guarding the homestead , kind of being your security guard . \nDescribe to me how your family and you have responded to this , because it 's something that you guys have lived there for years that you 've never experienced . \nAs you can tell , basic government functions have completely , like , failed , so citizens have taken it upon themselves . \nSo , my brother and every man in the neighborhood has been up every night without a wink of sleep standing in the streets , with either kitchen knives or , like , wooden sticks , baseball bats , creating their own militias to try to secure the neighborhoods and to take care of their loved ones up above . \nIt 's just - it 's very surreal because this is a very safe place normally . \nWe never have to worry about , you know , taking care of our own property or looters , any of this . \nBut because the reports of looting and vandalism and breaking into homes , every citizen has been on edge , and they have really been out in the streets every night , all the men grouped together and unified to secure the neighborhood . \nPHILLIPS : What about food ? \nWe 've been reporting about a shortage of food , and you ca n't get out to get any food . \nHave you experienced that ? \nAMER : Yes , I have . \nMy mother actually called me today very frantically . \nShe went to the supermarket there were a lot of shortages of food . \nPeople were there and they were really stocking up on all types of food products and supplies for the home . \nBecause people are very much on edge . \nWe do n't know what 's going to happens next . \nAnd if it continues and prolonged , then what will happen if there is a serious shortage of food ? \nPHILLIPS : Now , Dina , this is your age group , it 's the younger generation that are out there on the streets protesting . \nAre you surprised by this ? \nDid you sort of see this coming ? \nDo you have classmates that are out there , people that you have grown up with out on the streets ? \nAMER : I mean , this is very surprising . \nI 'm American-Egyptian , I used to come back every summer , every winter break . \nAnd I never in my -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- would have imagined this type of uprising to the Mubarak regime . \nBut it 's happening , and people are in the streets , very impassioned and relentlessly coming back every day . \nThe youth -- most of the youth are there because also , as you mentioned , there 's high unemployment . \nSo , this is kind of a sense of purpose every day to go out there and continue until they see their demands come to fruition . \nPHILLIPS : Dina Amer there , working for us in the Cairo bureau . \nSure appreciate you calling in . \nIt 's great to have your experience and your background as an Egyptian there working for us . \nDina , thank you . \nPHILLIPS : Well , eat less salt ? \nThat 's just one recommendation in the government 's new dietary guidelines . \nWe 're going to tell you what else is on the list for better health . \nPHILLIPS : The very latest on the situation in E -- Egypt , rather , in just a moment . \nBut first , we want to catch you up on a few international stories worth your attention today in the `` Morning Passport . '' \nU.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton back from a quick visit this weekend to Haiti . \nThis is in advance of the nation 's presidential runoff . \nThat 's coming up in March . \nNow , Secretary Clinton says she 's still got concern about the Haiti 's election protocols , but is n't considering to withhold crucial U.S. aid to Haiti . \nAnd to Cambodia , where published reports have surviving members . \nThe Khmer Rouge asking for their release from jail in advance of their war crimes trial set for next year . \nNow , the brutal regime is blamed for killing thousands of people , if not millions during the bloody rule in the late 1970s . \nTheir leader was found guilty back in July of last year . \nAnd Japan 's Mount Shimo . \nCool to look at , but bad to live close by . \nThe long-quiet volcano roared to life for the first time in 50 years , belching hot , molten ash to the townspeople below . \nFolks closest to the eruption have been safely evacuated . \nAnd just moments ago , the government released a new list of dietary guidelines , urging Americans to eat healthy foods . \nAmong the recommendations , cut down on salt . \nHigh-risk groups , no more than half a teaspoon a day . \nEverybody else , one teaspoon . \nPut more vegetables and fruits in your diet . \nReplace those refined grains with whole grains . \nAnd limit cholesterol intake to 300 milligrams per day . \nThe goal behind the new guidelines , promoting health , reducing the risk of chronic diseases , and fighting weight problems . \nPresident Obama 's push to create jobs is running smack into a hard truth . \nMost of the new jobs just are n't paying enough . \nNIC ROBERTSON , CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : The gunfire we can hear rocketing through the air , demonstrators say that 's the army firing to warn them to stay away . \nIt 's long - there 's gunshots - it 's long after curfew right now . \nAnd if the government was controlling the situation -- tracer fire flying into the air -- these people would n't be out on the streets if the government was in control . \nPHILLIPS : Last night -- earlier -- I spoke with Nic , and he says that today , the Egyptian army is using even more muscle . \nThey 're firing warning shots at protesters . \nPHILLIPS : An overwhelming majority of Republicans want the Tea Party to have some role in their party . \nSenior political editor Mark Preston following that story for us from the CNNpolitics desk . \nMARK PRESTON , CNN SENIOR POLITICAL EDITOR : Hey , good morning , Kyra . \nGreat news for Tea Party activists . \nA new Gallup poll just released a few hours ago shows that 90 percent of Republicans say that it 's important that the Tea Party 's ideas are given significant weight within the party as it 's going forward . \nNow , we really should n't be too surprised by this because the fact of the matter is , the Tea Party 's main platforms are really based on fiscal discipline and really cost cutting here in Washington , D.C. And given these tough , fiscal times , a lot of folks would like to see that happen . \nYou know , yesterday , the new White House chief of staff , Bill Daly was out on the talk show circuit . \nIn fact , he was on CBS ' `` Face The Nation . '' \nHe was asked about health care and moving forward the whole issue . \nWell , you know President Obama just last week in the State of the Union address said he would be open to working with Republicans to make some changes to that , although President Obama really defended the health care legislation that he really pushed through Congress last year . \nWell , the White House chief of staff reiterated that yesterday . \nHe said the president has said that he 's been open to changes , but he did go on to say that the president is not in favor of refighting this fight . \nWell , we know House representatives - the House Republicans pushed through the repeal of health care recently , so I suspect this will be an issue that Democrats and Republicans will continue to fight about . \nPHILLIPS : President Obama does n't just have to deal with the job loss , but also the kind of jobs being created . \nTell us about that . \nPRESTON : Yes , this is really a fascinating story that 's up on CNNmoney.com , written by Chris Isadora . \nThe fact of the matter is , there 's been a lot of talk about how many jobs have been lost . \nThe Obama administration Democrats are talking about jobs they have created since the recession . \nThe fact of the matter is , what kinds of jobs have they created ? \nNot great news , according to a new study from the National Employment Project . \nIn fact , 76 percent of jobs created in the first seven months of 2010 were in low - to mid-wage industries . \nThat 's basically people who earn between $ 8.92 to $ 15 an hour . \nWhat 's probably more disturbing , and more disturbing politically as well for President Obama as he heads into 2012 , high-wage sectors , which are jobs made up between people who make between $ 17.43 and $ 31 an hour , accounted for nearly half of all the jobs lost in this whole recession . \nBut only five percent of the new jobs that have been created are in that high-sector category . \nSo , yes , it 's a tough employment situation for the country , but it 's also a very difficult political position for President Obama to be in right now . \nWe 're going to have your next political update in just about an hour . \nAnd you can always go to our Web site , CNNpolitics.com , 24\\/7 . \nFrom easy lay-up to serious beatdown , high school basketball game takes a turn for the worse when parents get into the action . \nWhere is the love ?

\nThe fight started actually between the father and the school resource officer . \nThen the man 's wife and daughter did n't want to get left out . \nSo , hey , they both jumped into the fray . \nPolice say more arrests could come . \nPHILLIPS : All right . \nWe 're keeping a close eye on Egypt . \nAnd the fear and anger that 's rippling across the region right now . \nOver the last two weeks , five Arab states have been rocked by protests . \nAnd CNN 's Suzanne Malveaux takes a closer look how a regionwide movement began with a single street vendor . \n-LRB- AUDIENCE CHANTING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE -RRB- SUZANNE MALVEAUX , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Starting with Tunisia , where an unemployed graduate student sets himself on fire after a city inspector confiscates his unlicensed fruit cart and then allegedly slaps him . \nHis death sparks unprecedented fury and protests against the government , forcing Tunisia 's longtime president to flee . \n-LRB- AUDIENCE CHANTING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE -RRB- MALVEAUX : In Algeria , riots break out over rising food prices and a housing crisis . \n-LRB- AUDIENCE CHANTING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE -RRB- MALVEAUX : In Yemen , students take to the streets . \nEmboldened by its neighbors in the region - -LRB- AUDIENCE CHANTING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE -RRB- MALVEAUX : -- on Tuesday , Egypt erupts . \nAngered by the alleged corruption , police brutality , and lack of reforms in their own country , thousands pour into the streets , demanding Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak , who 's held power for nearly three decades , resign . \nProtesters are met with tear gas and violence . \nThe next day , the violence escalates as Egyptian security forces turn water cannons and tear gas on the growing angry crowds . \nThe Egyptian military urges calm . \nSocial media sites like Facebook and Twitter report that they are being blocked by the government the Thursday a leading Egyptian opposition figure , Mohammed ElBaradei , returns home from Europe vowing to back the protesters . \nThe Egyptian government then arrests a prominent leader of country 's largest opposition group , the Muslim brotherhood . \nThe Obama administration is alarmed by the growing intensity of the crisis , but reacts with caution . \nBARACK OBAMA , PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES : So , the government has to be careful about not resorting to violence , and the people on the streets have to be careful not to resort to violence . \nAnd I think that it 's very important that people have mechanisms in order to express legitimate grievances . \nMALVEAUX : As unrest spreads beyond Cairo in the days to come , protesters take to the streets in Qatar and Jordan to show demonstrators their support . \nMubarak goes on national television to tell Egyptians he government will resign , but he will stay in power . \nHis offer does not quell the angry and growing crowds . \nA thousand inmates break out of a prison outside Cairo . \nLooters ransack prison buildings and businesses , and vandals tear off the heads of mummies at the Egyptian Museum . \nJournalists report a dangerous power vacuum . \nBEN WEDEMAN , CNN SR. . \nINTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : The army is sort of controlling the street . \nPolitically , there is a complete vacuum . \nMALVEAUX : Heading into this week , thousands of Egyptians continue to defy Mubarak 's curfew by packing Cairo streets . \nAt the same time , American tourists are getting a lifeline out of the country . \nThe State Department now reports more than 200 are being flown out of the Egypt . \nKYRA PHILLIPS , CNN ANCHOR : Well , our Suzanne Malveaux is of course reporting on Cairo because she lived there and has first-time insights . \nBut also , we welcome you . \nYou have moved to Atlanta . \nPHILLIPS : This is your new gig . \nMALVEAUX : I 'm feeling a lot of love here , too , actually . \nIt 's been fantastic . \nPHILLIPS : Well , being a twin , I 'm expecting you to baby-sit my twins and to mentor my twins . \n-LRB- LAUGHTER -RRB- MALVEAUX : I will . \nI 'll have that second job . \nYou have a full - time job there , Kyra . \nYou have to carry both . \nI hope you 're ready . \nPHILLIPS : So what do you think , leaving the White House and coming to Atlanta ? \nMALVEAUX : You know , the news is everywhere . \nI 'm excited to be here , as well as in Washington . \nAnd obviously , yes , I lived in Cairo . \nA lot of friends there very concerned about what 's happening there . \nAnd it 's a very big story . \nSo we 're going to get started with that . \n"}

'' \nJudge Roger Vinson , in a 78-page ruling , dismissed the key provision of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act - the so-called `` individual mandate '' requiring most Americans to purchase health insurance by 2014 or face `` I must reluctantly conclude that Congress exceeded the bounds of its authority in passing the Act with the individual mandate . \nThat is not to say , of course , that Congress is without power to address the problems and Inequities in our health care system , '' Vinson wrote . \n`` Because the individual mandate is unconstitutional and not severable , the entire Act must be declared void . \nThis has been a difficult decision to reach , and I am aware that it will have indeterminable implications . \nAt a time when there is virtually unanimous agreement that health care reform is needed in this country , it is hard to invalidate and strike down a statute titled ` The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act . ' '' \nOn the heels of anti-government demonstrations in Tunisia , thousands of protesters spilled into the streets of Egypt in a rare display of anti-government outcry . \nCNN reporters on the scene witnessed throngs of people in Cairo march from Tahrir Square to the parliament building . \nDemonstrators threw rocks at police , who threw them back and shot tear gas at the protesters , who also

wanted to mirror the uprising in Tunisia , which 10 days prior had precipitated the end of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali 's 23-year rule . \nBefore the protests in Cairo , several Egyptians set themselves or tried to set themselves on fire earlier in the month , which also was reminiscent of Tunisia , where a man 's self-immolation spurred the uprising . \nThe Egyptian protesters - who included young and old , Christians and Muslims , students , workers and businesspeople - said they were angry over the cost of living , failed economic policies and corruption . \nThey demanded that

anti-gay slurs and sailors pretending to shower with each other aboard ship . \nIn early January , Honors was removed from his post commanding the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise . \nAn official 15-page statement that Honors gave to Navy investigators states that two commanding officers , two strike group admirals `` and myriad other senior military and civilian distinguished visitors '' were aware of the videos , according to the Navy Times . \nHonors made the videos in 2006 and 2007 when he was executive officer of the Enterprise , and they were discussed during meetings with the ship 's commanding officer and other leadership , the Navy Times reports . \nDuring these conversations , Honors received encouraging feedback about the content of the movies and was never told to stop making them , according to the report . \nHonors ' superiors did not respond to Navy Times ' requests for comment . \nA strong cyclone thrashed flood-ravaged Queensland , Australia , this week , but another

\nshould one say Al-Lah ? \nbecame obsessed by law . \nAmid the palm-trees of the oasis Gibreel appeared to the Prophet and found himself spouting rules , rules , rules , until the faithful could scarcely bear the prospect of any more revelation , Salman said , rules about every da-mn thing , if a man farts let him turn his face to the wind , a rule about which hand to use for the purpose of cleaning one 's behind . \nIt was as if no aspect of human existence was to be left unregulated , free . \nThe revelation the recitation - told the faithful how much to eat , how deeply they should sleep , and which se-xual positions had received divine sanction , so that they leamed that so-domy and the missionary position were approved of by the archangel , whereas the forbidden postures included all those in which the female was on top . \nGibreel further listed the permitted and forbidden subjects of conversation , and earmarked the parts of the body which could not be scratched no matter how unbearably they might itch . \nHe vetoed the consumption of prawns , those bizarre other-worldly creatures which no member of the faithful had ever seen , and required animals to be killed slowly , by bleeding , so that by experiencing their deaths to the full they might arrive at an understanding of the meaning of their lives , for it is only at the moment of death that living creatures understand that life has been real , and not a sort of dream . \nAnd Gibreel the archangel specified the manner in which a man should be buried , and how his property should be divided , so that Salman the Persian got to wondering what manner of God this was that sounded so much like a businessman . \nThis was when he had the idea that destroyed his faith , because he recalled that of course Mahound himself had been a businessman , and a damned successful one at that , a person to whom organization and rules came naturally , so how excessively convenient it was that he should have come up with such a very businesslike archangel , who handed down the management decisions of this highly corporate , if noncorporeal , God .

A devout Muslim s sense of his own intrinsic value , accordingly , does not rest upon recognition of God s likeness within him . \nHe measures it instead by the intensity of his uncritical submission to every requirement of the Koran ... The Koran and the Requirement of World Domination Mohammed could not have known the size of the world , but several passages in the Koran show that he envisioned Islam dominating all of it , however large it might be : He it is who sent his messenger ... that he may cause it -LRB- Islam -RRB- to prevail over all religions -LRB- Koran 9:33 , M.M. Ali ; see also 48:28 and 61:9 -RRB- . \nM.M. Ali designates these three passages as the prophecy of the ultimate triumph of Islam in the whole world . \nMohammed s successors , the caliphs , quoted passages like these to inspire Muslim armies as they advanced out of Arabia , imposing Islam by the sword upon a peacefully unsuspecting Middle East and North Africa , as I described in the previous chapter . \nIslamic armies , imbued with what Mohammed claimed was divine authorization , imposed Islam by force over vast areas , all the while extorting wealth from subjugated Jews and Christians to fund their ongoing conquests . \nAs I noted , major defeats at Tours , France , in A.D. 732 , and again at Vienna , Austria , in A.D. 1683 , halted Islam s attempt to take all of Europe by force . \nGradually Islamic forces were forced to retreat from Europe , except for part of the Balkans . \nBut Islam has again set its sights on a conquest of Europe and of European civilization , wherever the latter has spread to North and South America and other regions . \nMuslim strategists ask their followers , Why do we find in these modern times that Allah has entrusted most of the world s oil wealth primarily to Muslim nations ? \nTheir answer : Allah foresaw Islam s need for funds to finance a final politico-religious victory over what Islam perceives as its ultimate enemy : Christianized Euro-American civilization . \nSo , Islam follows Nazism , fascism and communism as the world s latest hostile takeover aspirant . \nNazis , fascists and communists failed . \nDoes Islam have a better chance at success ? \nI believe it will flounder if we awaken to its threat in time ; yet , if there is not adequate planned resistance , Islam does have a better chance of succeeding . \nCommunism s world takeover attempt was guaranteed to fail because its economic policy was naively contrary to human nature . \nAdvocating the rubric What is mine is thine , and what is thine is mine , communism failed to see that human nature will not keep those two balanced propositions in equilibrium . \nLike a female black widow spider consuming her mate , the latter part of the formula makes a meal of the former , leading to the collapse of any system based upon that formula . \nIn contrast , political systems do well if they can persuade people to adhere to What s mine is mine and What s thine is thine maxims . \nOnly if a strong religious incentive is added does such an idealistic formula have any long-term chance . \nEven then success will be spotty . \nBut communism -LRB- and Nazism , for that matter -RRB- excluded religion . \nAnd that mistake was the final nail eventually clamping a lid on communism s coffin . \nCommunism , on a historical scale , perished while still in its childhood . \nIslam is not repeating communism s mistake . \nMating political cunning and incredible wealth with religious zeal , Islam does have a chance to succeed and will succeed unless major parts of the Western world unite to take appropriate countermeasures . \nBut many Western leaders , unable to believe that a mere religion could possible be a serious political threat , keep proclaiming themselves as Islam-friendly , reasoning that all religions are good-aren t they ? \nA Muslim strategist in Beverly Hills , California , declared several years ago , as quoted by a friend of mine : Now that the struggle between Western democracies and international communism is winding down , it is time for the real and final struggle to begin , and we are going to win ! \n- D.

{"id": "108", "time": "2011-01-31", "text": "2 men charged in death of Chicago teen who performed in inauguration event . \nCNN reporters on the scene witnessed throngs of people in Cairo march from Tahrir Square to the parliament building . \nDemonstrators threw rocks at police , who threw them back and shot tear gas at the protesters , who also reciprocated . \nWhile Egypt estimated that there were 5,000 to 10,000 protesters , CNN estimated that the demonstration peaked at 15,000 to 20,000 protesters . \nThe protest 's organizers said they wanted to mirror the uprising in Tunisia , which 10 days prior had precipitated the end of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali 's 23-year rule . \nBefore the protests in Cairo , several Egyptians set themselves or tried to set themselves on fire earlier in the month , which also was reminiscent of Tunisia , where a man 's self-immolation spurred the uprising . \nThe Egyptian protesters - who included young and old , Christians and Muslims , students , workers and businesspeople - said they were angry over the cost of living , failed economic policies and corruption . \nThey demanded that President Hosni Mubarak , in power for three decades , follow the lead of Tunisia 's president . \n`` We breathe corruption in the air , '' said one demonstrator . \nOpposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei came forward to say that the government was not stable . \nThe Interior Ministry later said it would not allow `` any provocative movement or a protest or rallies or demonstrations . '' \nThe protesters were undeterred . \nThey clashed with police in Suez , and in Rafah , near the Gaza border , Bedouins tried to stop traffic by setting tires ablaze and throwing rocks at cars , according to Egypt 's state-run news agency . \nIn a sign that social networking was a catalyst in the demonstrations , Twitter said that it had been blocked for two days and that protesters were using other applications or proxy sites to get out their message . \nEgypt denied the claim , saying it had not blocked Facebook , Twitter or any other website and suggesting that the sites may have been slow because of the traffic . \nIn Washington , the White House called on both sides to refrain from violence and dubbed Egypt `` a strong ally . '' \nThe U.S. State Department said Egypt was integral to maintaining security in the Mideast because it has diplomatic ties with Israel , has participated in negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians and has aided efforts to stabilize Iraq . \nIt also contributes to U.N. peacekeeping missions and backs the U.S. war on terror , the State Department said . \nThe government continued to warn people against protesting as some Egyptians went door-to-door , urging their neighbors to take part in the demonstrations . \nSoccer matches in the country were canceled . \nThe stock market was shut down for an hour after it fell precipitously . \n`` The conditions were terrible , because very few were allowed to go to the toilet , and we had to stand on the cold tiles of the floor , -LRB- which were -RRB- very dirty , '' he said . \n`` The barrier of fear is broken , '' he said after arriving from Europe , `` and it will not come back . '' \nThe Muslim Brotherhood , the country 's largest opposition bloc , made its first call for its followers to join in the demonstrations -LRB- after Friday prayers -RRB- , a move that preceded prominent leader Isaam al-Aryan 's arrest . \nThe U.S. Embassy in Cairo later issued a statement telling Americans to avoid areas where people congregate after prayer . \nAsked whether Mubarak should step down , U.S. Vice President Joe Biden said , `` No , I think the time has come for President Mubarak to move in the direction to be more responsive to some of the needs of the people out there . '' \nHe further said that he felt Mubarak would respond to the `` legitimate concerns that are being raised '' and that many of the protesters were middle-class people simply looking for more opportunity . \n`` We ca n't understand how come this leader of the free world is looking the other way when it comes to our rights or freedom , '' he said . \n`` The despotic regime that -LRB- the U.S. -RRB- supports always demonizes the image of United States ... always putting blame on the United States for everything . '' \nReports emerged that the demonstrations have spread across the nation , from Cairo and Alexandria to Suez and Ismailia . \nSoldiers and tanks rolled into major cities as demonstrators in Cairo and Alexandria torched police stations while burning and overturning police vehicles . \nPlumes of smoke rose over the Nile River as police fired water cannons , rubber bullets and tear gas canisters into crowds . \nIt was the first time since 1985 that the army had been deployed to contain unrest . \nHowever , protesters said the army was far less aggressive than police had been , and in some cities , including Cairo and Alexandria , Egyptians applauded the arrival of tanks . \nAs Mubarak imposed a curfew from 6 p.m. Friday until Saturday morning because of `` hooliganism and lawlessness , '' social networking played an increasingly important role to the uprising as Egypt continued a widespread crackdown on communications within and leaving the country . \nU.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urged the protesters to be peaceful and said , `` We are deeply concerned about the use of violence by Egyptian police and security forces against protesters , and we call on the Egyptian government to do everything within its power to restrain its security forces . '' \nThe State Department urged Americans to postpone any nonessential travel to Egypt as airlines began canceling flights into the country . \nThe travel warning came as WikiLeaks released diplomatic cables showing that the U.S. is frustrated with Mubarak 's government but that it also considers Egypt an important and heretofore stable ally in negotiations over the Iranian nuclear program and in the handling of Hamas in Gaza . \nThe U.S. also regards Egypt as an important player in combating Islamic fundamentalism . \nHowever , the cables show that the U.S. is troubled by the torpid pace of finding a successor for the 82-year-old Mubarak , economic reforms and Egypt 's attitude toward domestic opponents . \nShortly after midnight , Mubarak asked the government to step down , saying in a televised address , '' I will commission a new government to take over tomorrow . '' \nLater in the day , he appointed intelligence chief Omar Suleiman as his deputy and tapped Ahmed Shafik , the civil aviation minister in the defunct Cabinet , to form a new government , state-run TV reported . \nU.S. President Barack Obama spoke with Mubarak after the address and told him he had a responsibility to `` take concrete steps and actions '' to deliver on the promise of democracy and greater economic opportunity that he made during his address to the Egyptian people . \nTens of thousands of protesters , many of them disappointed that Mubarak did not announce his resignation during his speech , defied the curfew to continue the protests . \nResponding to Mubarak 's announcement , ElBaradei told Al-Jazeera that Egyptians wanted a regime change , not new personnel . \n`` The Egyptian people are saying one thing : President Hosni Mubarak must leave . \nWe have to move towards a democratic state . '' \nWith security dwindling in some neighborhoods , businesses were looted , and abandoned police stations were robbed of their weapons . \nIn one Cairo neighborhood , roads were barricaded as residents handed out sticks and knives for protection , and armed men stayed up all night to protect their homes . \nOne resident likened the situation to `` the Wild West . '' \n`` There have been no police officers on the streets since this morning . \n... All the men are trying to protect the ladies , their wives and children , '' Cairo resident Sherief Abdelbaki said . \n`` We have all become vigilantes . '' \nIn one instance , thousands of chanting demonstrators ransacked the headquarters of the ruling National Democratic Party and set it afire , but when they approached the state-run television building , soldiers linked arms , forming a human chain . \nThe crowd stopped respectfully in front of the troops but continued chanting `` Down , down , Hosni Mubarak . '' \nBut there were also instances of protesters lashing out at the army . \nSuch was the case in Cairo , where demonstrators swarmed an army vehicle outside a hotel . \nAt the Interior Ministry , violence erupted between demonstrators and security forces . \nDr. Ragab Ali at the Ebad Al-Rahman Clinic said five people were fatally shot and another 60 were injured . \nAt Prison Demu , near Cairo , several officials were killed when 1,000 inmates escaped the facility . \nIn Alexandria , 31 people were killed in protests , according to officials , and chaos erupted when patients at a hospital grew angry that they were n't be treated quickly enough . \nAs Egypt 's ambassador to the U.S. said his communication with the White House had come to a halt , British Prime Minister David Cameron , French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel called on Mubarak to bring about a `` process of transformation '' and to hold `` free and fair elections . '' \nThe U.S. said it was reviewing its aid policy for the north African nation . \nIsrael remained largely quiet on the situation , and a Knesset member said he did n't believe that the protests could bring down Mubarak 's government because there were no viable leaders in the opposition . \n`` There is no leading figure that can lead the wave of protests till the regime falls , '' Benjamin Ben-Eliezer , who is considered to have the closest ties to Mubarak , told Israeli Army Radio . \n`` This is not a regime of one person , but it is backed by the army , the intelligence agencies and the secret service . '' \nThe U.S. began flying stranded Americans out of the country as demonstrators again defied Mubarak 's curfew . \nThe protests appeared largely peaceful as there were signs of increasing cooperation between the army and civilians , both fed up with looting and threats of violence from opportunistic criminals . \nMore than 3,000 people , including looters and escaped prisoners , had been arrested , state-run media reported . \nAli Regal , a student activist in Alexandria , said the military was working with demonstrators to coordinate security and map out a plan to set up checkpoints across the port city , but there were still signs of unrest . \n`` The army is very helpful and working with us , '' Regal said . \n`` There is a strong cooperation between the masses and the army . '' \nAt Cairo 's Tahrir Square , crowds flanked ElBaradei , cheering his arrival . \nHe told protesters he came `` to participate today in the lives of Egyptians . \nToday , I look into the eyes of each one of you , and everyone is different today . \nToday , you are an Egyptian demanding your rights and freedom , and what we started can never be pushed back . \nAs we said , we have one main demand : the end of the regime and to start a new phase . '' \nFatma Morayef , a Human Rights Watch researcher in Tahrir Square , said , `` The square has emptied out since the afternoon , but it 's still a great atmosphere , a sense of solidarity and very well-behaved : People are sitting around bonfires or walking around picking up rubbish , '' Morayef said . \n`` Crowds who find occasional looters drag them over to the soldiers and hand them over . '' \nSeveral thousand people remained in the square Sunday night , and many said they plan to stay until Mubarak resigns , Morayef said . \nThough Mubarak has given no indication that he intends to step down , he opened the door to `` dialogue with all the political parties , '' state-run media reported . \nHe conceded that the protests had been peaceful but said the demonstrators had been `` infiltrated by a group of people who use the name of religion , who do n't take into consideration the constitution rights and citizenship values . '' \nOverall , said Sameh Shoukry , the Egyptian ambassador to the U.S. , `` The situation seems to be improving slightly in terms of security for private and public property . '' \nHowever , the ambassador said he had heard no communication from Cairo or Washington . \nIn Israel , Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that he wanted peace and stability in the region and that he was `` anxiously monitoring '' the situation in Egypt . \nShocking -- the inane rantings of a bunch of anti-Israel , anti-US , naive -LRB- and most likely , Muslim -RRB- morons . \nOh wait -- this is CNN.com ; why should I expect anything else from a `` news '' organization made of anti-Israel , anti-US , naive morons . \nSuch is to be expected from a person of your obvious limitations . \nCNN is not the right-wing Fox Network . \nIn fact , I 'm they let moderates and liberals post here . \nThat right is usually limited to conservative fanatics in most places . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 3:56 am | Report abuse | There is great hype that today , one million Egyptians will protest in Cairo . \nIt sounds a HUGE number but -- where are the other 82 million people ??? This isn ` t even 10 % and I would hazard a guess that at least half of the one million are under the age of 20 . \nSo where is the sense in all this ?? Are reporters making a mountain out of a mole hill ? \nAnd how do you govern 82 million people ? \nA quick and peaceful end to this demand for freedom is made all the more uncertain by Obama 's cowardly refusal to support the people reaching out for freedom . \nAfter his Cairo speech , claiming to support democracy and freedom , he now huddles in the WH hoping to spot the winner , so that he can choose sides . \nThe side if freedom is clear to the Egyptians who are watching and waiting to see what we do . \nIf the choice goes to and Islamic state , we can claim a good portion of the blame by our failure to stand up with the protesters . \nok ... that 's enough on egypt now . \nthey do n't like us . \nlet 's just stop sending money there and do n't help anyone develop anything ... they hate us . \nlet them get themselves where they want to be . \nlet the corporations deal with that . \nThis guy has been president for 30 years ! \nImagine Bush being the president for 30 years . \nUm , um , um . \nWe need to be brave enough to say : `` We support freedom and democracy where ever and when ever it is organically derived from the will of the people . \nThis support is unequivocal and without consideration to whether or not the will of those people will lean towards admiration or cynicism of the United States . \nAs a Country , lets be honest enough to admit that if the Arab Street feels hesitancy towards embracing American ideals , at least some part of it originates from the fact that as a Country we have subverted many of our own ideals in choosing the political expediency of supporting dictators friendly to us rather than the moral courage of supporting the uncertainty of a popular movement . \nThis needs to forever change . \nI ll let the state department write the Obama Doctrine that surely must follow . \nCNN : This story started 30 years ago with a US-backed puppet . \nThis is a story that plays-out over and over . \nWe give Mubarak hundreds of millions per year ; we have kept him in power to keep Egypt from attacking Israel . \nNow the whole thing is blowing-up in our faces . \nHow will the Egyptian people deal with those who kept Mubarak in power ? \nI venture to say with Kensian realism . \nI think we give them Billions , not millions . \nWe need to recognize that Egypt is n't Iran -LRB- although I 'm sure they 've taken note -RRB- . \nReligious governments are not quite known for their civil liberties , which is what this uprising is in large part about . \nThe financial systems around the world are hanging on by a thread . \nThe bankers are using every form of deception they can conjure up to keep it from imploding . \nManipulation of metals trading shorts when they have no physical metals to back the sell -LRB- just like the paper with ink they say are `` dollars '' -RRB- , to buying Treasury Bonds from Goldman Sach 's at a higher interest rate payable by the taxpayers than buying the Treasury Bonds from the Treasury where the taxpayers would gain , instead the interest gets paid to Goldman Sach 's and the taxpayers get the bill , and the continued printing of counterfeit Federal Reserve Notes by the trillions devaluing every single note you have in your pocket . \nIt is and always has been all throughout history the last act of a dying empire or banana republic to devalue the currency before it 's financial systems collapsed . \nHistory is upon the USA yet again . \nOnly this time there are no forefathers to speak with intelligence and forethought , no Representation in the Government to demand it be done different , no people who can stand together without ignorance speaking to disrupt the goal , we can get 100,000 or more to go to an NFL game , but ca n't get 1,000 to stand in front of city hall and say that 's enough when they steal everything and take no responsibility . \nSorry but we have become weak as a citizenry and need to wake up to the false division we have been led to believe that are not true . \nI wonder what the military is going to do here when they are ordered to fire on and kill all protesters when this happens here ? \nWill you Mister Military Guy or Gal kill your American Brothers and Sisters and Children to protect the very people who have voluntarily created and perpetrated this crime against America , the Bankers , Politicians , and the Criminals who are the Foreign Corporations who you kill for now all over the world , will you kill your own countrymen to protect them ? \nYou will be asked to do so , if you have n't already . \nIt 's a shame that the People allowed this to happen . \nIt is entirely our , THE PEOPLE 's , fault ! \n@Vallen , so much truth to your post , but a bit unrealistic and pessimistic toward the end . \nThere wo n't be killing of protesters here . \nWell , I 'm not sure I 'm as pessimistic as Vallen , but I do remember something regarding Kent State in which that very thing happened -LRB- military firing on protesters -RRB- . \nPerfect as clear as drinking water . \nNo , say that instead of reaching the violent point this conflict will be settle on the table , negotiating and reaching the best solutions for all parts . \nThere is a possibility and this is withing the hands of the educated population of Egypt who know that the best for the country is not revolution but evolution . \nIf the government has failures those has to be corrected , if Mubarak is not a good leader then help him making the country better , if there are no opportunities , create them . \nNow there is a totally different reality from my standing point , but for sure Egypt deserves better responses for their problems , and more assertive solutions for their needs . \nComments are not pre-screened before they post . \nYou agree that anything you post may be used , along with your name and profile picture , in accordance with our Privacy Policy and the license you have granted pursuant to our Terms of Service . \nCarnival Triumph cruise ship that experienced fire in engine room being towed to Mobile , AL instead of Mexico #CNN Could the next pope be from Africa or Latin America ?

\nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 4:23 pm | Reply It is now or never , Our Democracy is being tested Our constitution calls for a free and democratic society , respecting human rights and freedom of speech , a message that we have been fighting to spread , and support all over the world . \nToday , we are going through a test , and it may be our last chance to prove that we practice what we preach , are we going to stand by our beliefs , or are we going to stand by a dictator who has held his nation under siege for 30 years . \nIt was always clear that the Mubarak Regime was never a democratic one ; in fact , the opposite is true . \nIt has been one of the most oppressive regimes in recent history , it wouldn t take much in the age of information technology to learn about Mubarak Regime and how bad it is , Egyptians have been living in terror and fear of the regime for decades , and US and allies of Egypt have been misled by Mubarak , and his government , believing his justification of implementation 30 years of emergency law and atrocities towards his nation is only done to protect the world from an Islamic Egyptian Government and terrorism . \nIt is natural that we support a moderate government in Egypt , which is considered an important ally , and partner in our fight against terrorism , but we should have been more careful in believing and analyzing Mubarak Lies , our political analysts should have realized that we were being scammed by Mubarak , believing his lies , and ignoring his actions , and the frequent screams of Egyptians for freedom and democracy . \nWhy did we wait , and why did we continue to support an 82 years old dictator against the well of his nation , soon enough his regime would have collapsed with or without an internal revolution , it is clear to anyone that the not so intellectual dictator s health is failing , he has had some serious health issues for the past few years , and despite of his jet black hair , and plastic surgeries , it is clear that age has taken its toll , Mubarak has had a hearing impairment for years , and his refusal to wear a hearing aid , has made him the joke of the media . \nMost recently , it is clear that he can t stand up or walk in a straight line . \nWe should have thought and planned of what is after Mubarak , and the future of our relationship with Egypt . \nIt is time to admit that we have been scammed by Mubarak , and in believing his lies , that we have sacrificed so much money , that never benefited the Egyptian people , and it may have been abused by the dictator and his regime , it is American technology , equipment and Military AID that is being used to suppress freedom fighters in Egypt . \nThe US should never support governments that hold its nation hostage without phone lines , internet , and basic human rights . \nThe Mubarak regime in a move that will go in history , and after abusing and killing demonstrators , has withdrew all security forces , including fire fighters , and traffic controllers from the streets , and has aided prisoners release so he can teach his nation a lesson they can never forget , in the hope that his secret police and released criminals will terrorize the public enough to get them distracted from their fight for freedom and democracy . \nIt is our obligation to stand by democracy and freedom fighters ; it is our duty to support our constitution and what we really believe in , over the past few days Egyptians have been pleading for US help , and we have not taking a firm stand in supporting their cause , Indeed we may be concerned about a hard line new government that may unbalance peace and reform initiatives , but in taking a calculated risk , a peaceful revolution that is initiated by new generations of young and educated Egyptians , and through Social Media and electronic communication will never allow a hard line Islamic government to take power , Egyptians are looking for a free and democratic society that is not so different from ours , supporting their cause today , may pay off much more than what Mubarak did , as they are looking for reform and development , not war and terrorism . \nWe hope that our government acts in a timely fashion , before it is too late , Mubarak days in office are numbered . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 4:53 pm | Reply when will the internet in egypt be back on ?

January 31 , 2011 at 7:08 pm | Reply As Egypt stands at the dawn of democracy , one question should not remain unasked nor unanswered . \nWhat kind of democracy can , will or should emerge , so that this democracy addresses and fulfills the needs and aspirations of its people in the best possible way ? \nNot only do the Egyptian people hold the opportunity to shape their own democracy , they also have an opportunity to update the very system of democracy as the world knows it . \nIn democracies of the past there were limited means for dialogue between the people and their government . \nThe democratic elections once every X years could therefore be seen as the only feasible way for the people to exert their opinions on how their country should be governed . \nToday however , we live in a vastly different world where people are increasingly more knowledgeable , connected , informed , proactive and passionate about their causes . \nToday , we live in a world where one uploaded video can touch the lives of millions , where one blog entry can spark a national debate and where the protest of one man in Tunisia can change the future of entire countries . \nYet , despite all the technological advances and innovations that has changed virtually every aspect of our lives , the democratic system that governs many people 's lives today is largely still the same limited democracy of the past where its people can only exert their influence in a very limited way , through a vote once every X years . \nIn light of the vastly decreased amount of transaction costs of communication between the government and its people , and in light of the vastly increased amount of valuable knowledge , skills and expertise of its people , what role can governmental crowdsourcing platforms play -LRB- both online and offline -RRB- to inventarize the needs , problems and priorities of its people , channel their aspirations and utilize their creativity and productivity to bring effective solutions towards their desired future ? \nWith the Egyptian youth leading the protests in Egypt , mobilizing millions with social media , email , phone , text and word of mouth , has the time come for a new kind of democracy of the people , by the people and for the people ? \nHas the time come for democracy 2.0 ? \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 7:17 pm | Reply Somebody asked what was wrong with Islamist parties . \nLet 's start with their willingness to brainwash stupid young men and women to blow up innocent people and go on from there shall we ? \nDoes anybody wonder how a country like America became a force to reckon with ? \nWell , they started with a Continental Congress , decided what type of country they wanted and then they had a revolution against the mother country , not the other way round . \nWhat they did n't do was mob the streets . \nPeople who mob the streets end up with an Islamist state or as in the case of Russia , with the USSR . \nWhen you mob and your country totters , you find yourself starving and have opened the door to the first group , no matter who they are , who offers food . \nInstead of blaming the U.S for everything , why not make your own country democratic and good and work with the western countries ? \nWe live pretty nicely in the west . \nYou have to ask yourself what we are doing right ? \nWell , we do n't blow up churches that 's for sure , and kill people for their beliefs , or blow up mosques or synagogues , or tell people what to believe about the God we do n't necessarily know exists . \nWe are no longer the Inquisition of 600 years ago . \nWe have grown up . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 7:19 pm | Reply I do not trust Mohamed El Baradei . \nHe has been too close to Islamic Republic from Iran , IRI , in his position as the chief for IEAE . \nIt is crazy that when we go out to challenge Islamic Fascism there then President Obama is indifferent but here when Islamic brotherhood put up the agenda he sympathizes with them . \nPlease read something about the tactical details Islamic people used back in 1978 to topple shah of Iran . \nThey worked just like they do now in Egypt with deception . \nThe let normal gestalts to be the face of the movement outwards and just a year after shah was gone they pushed those people aside or shoot them like Mr. Sadegh Ghotbzadeh . \nPlease Google on this . \nShah of Iran could by

Everyone should know the main concern of the United States in regard to Egypt is how that affects their relationship with Israel . \nFor the last 30 years , the United States policy has been to support Mubarak , simply due to the fact he rules in defiance oft the will of the Egyptian people . \nA puppet of the US , he accept US dollars as a bribe in kind , to support his dictatorial regime whcih he facies to be his personal kingdom . \nHe jails the opposition , but that is the norm for the ME in regard to US suport . \nDemocratic governments simply are impossible for the US to control . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 7:46 pm | Reply February 8 , 2011 at 7:01 pm | Reply MUBARAK : TO BE OR NOT TO BE Mubarak did well in his past 30 year reign . \nHe is today being accused for things that was out of his hand or out of his control , which was his inability to control the hyper inflation that is the major cause of the Tahrir upheaval . \nTo my opinion , especially as what I have seen during the last 25 years since my return to Egypt in 1985 , . . \nis as follows : Egypt had gone through calm transition after President Sadat 's assassination . \nThings were basically calm and Egypt was a poor country coming out of a very expensive war . \nPeople were living a very basic life , with a market that still had a communist character to it ; with government cooperatives selling subsidized food to long ques of people , and government department stores selling cheap cloth and basic low quality household items . \nPeople did not own cars yet , . . \nand the few fortunate had televisions , telephones , and even fridges . \nThose who had washing machines were like living in a future world . \nBut people were happy since their needs were very basic and food was plenty and cheap . \nMubarak wanted to change all this and put Egypt into the New Modern World with a goal to bring Egypt up to the level of the developed nations , so he started a five year reform program so as to industrialize the nation . \nDuring these five years of reform that started in the mid eighties , . . \nthe country was progressing fast , ... all levels of people in Egypt were seeing the benefits of this economic revival . \nThere was plenty of money circulating the market , . . \nfood was cheap , there was a boom of supermarkets , a non existent unemployment figure in the economy , a large import of luxury goods such as cars and domestic items , a booming investment market , creation of many private schools , a strong export market , and a mass exodus of Egyptian manpower working abroad returning a large remittance to Egypt 's national coffer . \nTHEN THINGS STARTED GOING BAD in 1991 . \nThe 5 year industrial reform program that was initiated by the Egyptian government were the heydays of Egypt . \nThese 5 years of industrial revolution was from 1986 to 1991 , and the Egyptian population witnessed it 's best times in modern Egyptian history . \nUnemployment was non-existent , business and investment was booming , money was plenty and circulating on the market vigorously , those not happy traveled to find a better life and work abroad , imports and exports were exceptionally high , . \nIn fact the remittance from Egyptians working abroad was the bulk of Egypt GNP , circa 15 billion dollars annually , surpassing the other booming national incomes such as the Suez Canal , Tourism , and Agricultural exports . \nThe government and population was drenched with this excess wealth squandering this money like a spoilt child . \nIn fact the government borrowed from the IMF 20 billion dollars on interest free loan , in which the Egyptian government had a plan to pay this loan back , believing that the economic boom would last . \nThis interest free loan from the IMF or World Bank was used to build the main infrastructures needed for the industrial revolution such as electric power plants , large sewage systems for the big cities , high tech communications , roads , and certain industries . \nThat was only the beginning of Egypt 's woes . \nThen suddenly out of the blue , . . \ncomes the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the 1991 Desert War in Iraq . \nCirca 5 million Egyptians had to repatriate back to Egypt in a few month . \nA sudden invasion of returning Egyptians from Iraq , . \na beginning to Egypt 's economic downfall . \n15 billion dollars of income interring Egypt 's coffer , due to the remittance of Egyptians in Iraq and the heavy export of Egyptian goods to Iraq , suddenly becomes non-existent . \nA surprising shock not calculated in the Egyptian 's 5 year industrial reform plan , . \nwere Egypt 's main national income which was coming from Iraq was the main remuneration needed to pay back it 's free interest loans to the IMF or the World Bank , . . \nplus other accrued debts with other countries and commercial institutions . \nAdd to this miscalculated economic event are the 5 million now unemployed Egyptians returning empty handed due to the evacuation policies of Iraq . \nAn angry and frustrated people demanding their places in an Egyptian labor market that was not ready for this exodus . \nA few month pass and the Egyptian economy is trying to employ these displaced Egyptians from Iraq at a heavy cost so as to quail their disappointment , but a larger problem was now knocking on the Nations door , . . \nrepayment of the interest free loans and other outstanding debts . \nSince Egypt lost its main export market plus a very large revenue from Egyptian expat remittance all coming from Iraq , its GNP fell drastically . \nHere is one of the largest problems that is the precursor to the problems we see today , . . \nthe IMF and World Bank demand Egypt to float the Egyptian pound due to it 's falling GNP and export losses . \nThe floating of the pound sent the Egyptian pound falling from 1.80 L.E a Dollar to 3.25 L.E a Dollar , . . \na devaluation of at least 100 percent . \nSo these interest free loans from the IMF or World Bank now cost Egypt and its population double the price ; a repayment of 36 billion L.E pre 1991 to a shocking 65 billion Egyptian pounds post 1991 . \nThe Egyptian government had to repay this loans so as not to default , . . \nits only way was by increasing prices on the local market through taxes , stamps , electricity , water , government services , . . \nBut the people accepted the increased market prices since still the Food Prices had not reached the danger marker . \nBut this was only one of the misfortunes , and the coming years other misfortunes were to come . \nStarting from 1991 with the floating of the Egyptian pound due to IMF and World Bank requirements , . . \nprices in Egypt had tripled during a few months . \nFor example a car that was priced at 4,500 L.E pre1991 was now 15,000 L. E , meat that was priced at 8 L.E pre1991 was now 20 L. E , a house that was priced at 45,000 L.E pre1991 was now priced at 110,000 L.E. . \nSo now the Egyptian market had to rehabilitate itself and stabilize to this new hyper inflation such as by increasing wages . \nNow that Iraq was a lost export market for Egypt , the country had to look at other world markets so as to recuperate it 's hard currency that was depleting . \nThe problem here is that the GATT talks , that was now part of the new world order , had a certain criteria for countries to enter this global export and import network . \nThe IMF and World Bank enters this picture again , . . \ndemanding that Egypt has to privatize its national industries and get rid of government subsidized commodities that was essential to the low income Egyptians . \nSo again another woe to Egypt 's economy , a very costly transition to suddenly change a whole national system from nationalization to privatization to fulfill the GATT criteria . \nThis privatization program took a few years where gradually a large population of the labor force working in nationalized industries were suddenly asked to leave their work with a very small remittance . \nSo gradually we have an unemployment figure increasing again due to a large labor population out of work due to the new privatization program , . . \na privatization program that was formed by a world body that had not even created a labor law to protect the rights of a new labor market . \nAdd more salt to this situation , . \nsuddenly the subsidized commodities that was the essential welfare of the disadvantaged or poor , had disappeared from the local market . \nA few examples of these subsidized commodities are sugar , oil , soap , rice , chicken , meat , fish , and flour . \nSo now we have a large unemployed and disgruntled low income population created by the privatization program , who also see their subsidized commodities suddenly increase two fold in price . \nBut the Egyptian Government had to follow the GATT regulations and criteria otherwise an export market needed for hard currency would disappear and the soft loans from the IMF\\/World Bank needed for the ongoing economic development would be non-existent . \nA catch 22 state that had stressed the Egyptian economy . \nBut the Egyptian population was patient and resilient , putting their trust on Mubarak 's government ; a population used to hardships and optimistic that things could not get worse . \nBut alas , . . \nthe coming years had more disasters to envelope . \nFrom 1991 -- 2001 , during this 10 year period , Egypt saw its economic fortunes depleting . \nA triple inflation rate and a very large unemployment level never experienced in Egypt 's modern history ; all due to the 1991 Iraq war , the floating of the Egyptian pound , the privatization of the nationalized industries , and the removal of commodity subsidies used for a very large needy population . \nBut the Egyptian population kept on striving , and what used to be a slow paced life prior to 1991 was now a fast hard working double job life to most Egyptian citizens . \nBut nobody complained , since the character of the Egyptian people due to their religious believes made them thankful that they were still able to make ends meet , based on their religious ideology that things could be worse if GOD-willing . \nThen came 2001 with the unfortunate and shocking 9 11 attack on the North East of the USA . \nAnother uncontrollable factor that was going to again affect the Egyptian economy in a very negative way . \nEgyptian citizens were accused of siding with underground Islamic forces such as AL Qaida , that were anti-American and even anti-European . \nSo came out an international policy by the USA , the newly formed European Community , and their allies to curtail Visas and travel to Egyptians . \nIn another words , travel out of Egypt for Egyptians to most countries of the world , was now stopped by the US and EU on the basis that most Egyptians could be terrorists sympathizing with an anti-western Islamic movement . \nSo Egyptians that were unemployed or looking for a better life and work abroad were not able to travel as was a norm before 2001 . \nSince the open door policy of Sadat that started circa 1975 , nearly a quarter of Egypt 's population traveled abroad for better opportunities of work and a better life . \nIt is these Egyptians that traveled to the USA , Europe , Iraq , Australia , Canada , and most of he world that were returning large remittance to Egypt making them one of the countries largest hard currency earners . \nAnother blow to the Egyptian economy , a returning population of Egyptians that feared political and racial reprisals abroad , were now joining an already increasing number of unemployed in Egypt that could not travel abroad due to the travel restrictions . \nIncluded is the lost hard currency remittance of the returning Egyptians , plus the lost opportunity of increased hard currency of what would have been an increased remittance by Egyptians who would have traveled if the travel restriction had not taken place . \nLife now was getting very hard for the Egyptians in Egypt due to the very high unemployment rate and a very large decrease in hard currency remittance , stressing the Egyptian economy that still had to pay it 's hard currency debts so as not to default . \nThe Egyptian government had no other choice now but tax and increase prices on the local market so as to meet the countries expenditures and foreign debts . \nAnd it still does not stop here , since another woe was knocking on the door . \nPost 2001 Egypt were the years of social upheaval and change . \nUnemployment was reaching 15 percent due the conglomeration of Egyptians who returned from Iraq , those who lost their jobs due to the privatization program , and those who returned from the US and Europe due to racial reprisals created from the 9 11 attack . \nAdded to these numbers were the new graduates from Universities who could not find employment due to the stagnate industries that had lost it 's export markets to the Arab world . \nWhere once the unemployed and dissatisfied Egyptians would travel abroad to search for employment and a better life , the Visas and travel was know closed to them due to the anti terrorist policies that was forced on Egypt by international bodies . \nBut the Egyptian population was still striving by creating local small business , inventing menial jobs and services , saving , and even stealing and begging . \nThe population was now at a very high stress level ; disgruntled , angry , and negative . \nThuggery and corruption was now at a rise with a high crime rate that had never existed before in Egypt 's past history . \nThe population was ready to explode and the fragile economy was walking on a thin line . \nThe government had no time to think about the countries internal social problems since it was putting all its attention into shifting it 's hard currency earning industries that were industrial exports and remittance to tourism , petroleum and electricity exports , and the Suez Canal . \nThe police force was given the green light and the right to use excessive power to control the increasing crime , thuggery , and discontent . \nThis extended power to the Ministry of interior gave the police absolute power which was used to quail a now volatile population through fear . \nSo life in Egypt starting from 2002 were years of hardship with a faltering economy , even though inflation was still at check . \nThen came the last woe which is the precursor to the Tahrir Uprising . \nBy 2002 the Egyptian economy was functioning internally , the population was striving on the money that was circulating in the local market . \nIndustrial exports were at a standstill and Egypt 's hard currency earnings were from a few industries such as tourism , petroleum and electricity exports , and the Suez Canal . \nSince the increasing population was demanding more resources , the governments expenditures were increasing over its earnings creating an economic depression . \nThen out of a black sky the Euro was created , and Egypt 's currency floats again due to the World Banks evaluation of the Euro rate . \nA few month down the road the IMF and World bank demand Egypt to float the Egyptian pound against the dollar for a second time . \nThis was it , . . \nthe Egyptian pound devalued another 100 percent from 3.33 LE to 6.00 L.E to the dollar , clearly meaning that imports and Egypt 's outstanding foreign debts were going to double in price . \nThe Cash starved Egyptian economy was broke , and hard currency earnings from the national industries were not sufficient to pay outstanding foreign debts , . . \nthe government started collecting off the local market . \nFrom 2002 up to today , . . \nthe Egyptian economy was now in a deep depression with hyper-inflation hitting the local market without disdain . \nEvery year there was a price increase on all products on the market , may it be foodstuffs , building material , petrol , electricity , water , transportation , medical bills , education , real estate , and nearly any imaginable thing . \nEgyptians were now really stressed since none could meet their ends . \nFor eight years an angry Egyptian population were complaining about the government 's excessive price hikes , . . \naccusing them of stealing the countries wealth and being corrupt and therefore the main reason to the counties depressive state . \nYes , there was excessive corruption and many elite figures in the higher echelons of the government and business community did make excessive amount of money due to the abuse of their power , positions , and wealth ; but that was only a fraction of what was lost due to the economic woes that was pushed upon the country due to international monetary policies . \nDuring these past eight years shanty towns were sprouting in any empty quarters of the country , the government could not check these hotbeds of discontent since the people themselves were aggressive . \nThese hotbeds of discontent created a ruthless population of violent citizens that would grab at any chance to make money , . \nif it was through crime , creating mafia organizations who were monopolies inflating prices on certain commodities , and stealing at any opportunity . \nThuggery became a norm , and the economy on the market based itself on the survival of the wiliest , corrupt , and strong . \nThe Government had to check the population giving the police force and the Ministry of internal affairs the full rights and freedom to use excessive force on the population . \nThe police force and its security apparatus was now a business on its own , with its absolute freedom to use it 's powers as needed . \nIncredible to see a society and a cultural character that used to be passive and polite suddenly change to aggressive and attacking . \nMay it be the poor , the police , the rich , or the government , everybody was gnawing at the other . \nThe police was under stress to control the crimes and revolutionary elements that were increasing in the squalid quarters of the mega-city shanty towns , so they became a business on their own by protecting richer areas of the society and getting compensations for these works , because even the under payed police force was affected by the economic depression . \nThe depression became a boom for the rich and a boon to the poor and middle class . \nTo prove the importance of what is stated in this article , this was posted by Reuters dealing with a economic reform plan declared by the new Egyptian cabinet on the 13th day of the January 25th uprising : Feb 08 , 2011 at 12:52 CAIRO -- Egypt 's new cabinet promised to keep subsidies in full and draw in foreign investment at its first meeting since an uprising driven in part by poverty and economic hardship broke out two weeks ago . \nIncredible but during the last 8 years prior to 2011 , . . \none could observe how the rich got richer and increased in number during the depression and vise verse with the poor . \nThe stressed Middle class was in a magnet being pulled by both sides , . . \nsome dropped to a poorer level while other became a new higher middle class . \nThis was due to a large unemployed labor sector , in which competition between the unemployed laborers for work brought their wages dropping to unsustainable levels in which they could not reach the end of the month if they did not borrow money , work a double shift , live in deplorable conditions , or exhort money . \nThe rich were getting richer due to the low labor wages and a poor government that was accepting kickbacks . \nSo the law of the jungle was functioning in the economics of a mega-city which was the economic nucleus and therefore effecting the country as whole . \nOnly the past 8 years did the population of Egypt curse their President and a police force that was using excessive force for stability and control . \nA President that was respected and liked up to the past eight years . \nMubarak is not able to tell his people that all the economic miss falls of the Egyptian economy was due to international policies that had cheated him and Egypt outright . \nHe let corruption rampart since the people were aggressively out of control and he became incumbent due to the continuously uncontrolled misfortunes that happened to Egypt in only 11 years . \nIt does n't really matter if Mubarak is to be or not to be the President of Egypt , since the problem can only be solved if the travel restrictions on Egyptians to travel abroad is lifted and the International Momentary fund plus World Bank re-evaluates the Egyptian pound . \nThank You for your attention : February 11 , 2011 at 12:49 pm | Reply Go up and spread to a certain extent You the Egyptians however proved something else : People s movement has no limit Till the dictator kneels before the public demands -LRB- required , but will not be displayed -RRB- CNN welcomes a lively and courteous discussion as long as you follow the Rules of Conduct set forth in our Terms of Service . \nComments are not pre-screened before they post . \nYou agree that anything you post may be used , along with your name and profile picture , in accordance with our Privacy Policy and the license you have granted pursuant to our Terms of Service . \nCongrats to #Nigeria winning #africacupofnations . \nTe @BeckyCNN yCNN ca n't rule out link betw 'n extremists #Somalia alia & a #Mali Mali \n"}

'' \nMubarak 's newly appointed vice president , longtime intelligence chief Omar Suleiman , announced Monday that he had begun discussing reform with opposition parties . \nSpeaking on the state television network , Suleiman said a reform package should be drawn up `` expeditiously . '' \nGunfire amid protests in Cairo Egypt VP : Reform comes through dialogue Egypt 's protesters not swayed by tanks `` The other parties will also have a role to play , which will lead to real political reform , '' Suleiman said . \nBut there were no details of what proposals might be on the table , nor was there any immediate reaction from opposition figures or any indication of which parties were taking part . \nAnd at the same time , the government has shut down the country 's rail network , posted troops at key locations , closed banks and schools and pulled the plug on mobile phone and internet service ahead of Tuesday 's protests . \nMubarak has ruled Egypt for nearly 30 years under a sweeping emergency decree , imposed after the 1981 assassination of his predecessor , Anwar Sadat . \nA wave of protests against his regime erupted following the uprising in Tunisia that ousted its longtime strongman January 14 , and Arab League Secretary-General Amre Moussa -- Mubarak 's former foreign minister -- called Monday for a peaceful transition of power `` from an era to the other , '' the French news agency AFP reported . \nEgypt 's military announced Monday evening that it recognized `` the legitimate demands of the honest citizens '' and would not open fire on peaceful protesters . \n`` The presence of the armed forces in the Egyptian streets is for your benefit to protect your safety and peace , '' an unnamed spokesman announced on state television Monday night . \n`` Your armed forces will not use violence against this great people , who have always played a significant role in every moment of Egypt 's great history . '' \nAnd human rights activist and blogger Ramy Raoof told CNN 's `` Parker Spitzer '' that troops are mingling with demonstrators in Cairo 's Tahrir Square . \n`` There is no aggressive behavior from the army toward the peaceful assemblies , '' he said early Tuesday . \n`` We hope that within a few hours , the same also will happen . \nWe hope the army will not escalate violence against us . '' \nThough Mubarak has given no indication that he will bow to demands for his ouster , he fired his Cabinet on Saturday , and his designation of Suleiman as vice president marks the first time he has filled that post since he came to power in 1981 . \nMonday , Mubarak swore in Mahmoud Wagdy as the new interior minister to replace Habib el-Adly , who has been criticized by protesters because of police actions . \nOthers sworn in on Monday were Finance Minister Samir Radwan , a former economist at the International Labor Organization , and Health Minister Ahmed Hosni Farid . \niReporters help cover Egypt protests Tony Blair discusses Egypt crisis Will unrest spread to other countries ? \nAt a glance : Nations facing unrest Radwan told CNN 's `` Quest Means Business '' that his priority is `` to show that this is a government that responds to the demands -- the fair demands , I would say -- of the people in Tahrir Square . '' \n`` We need to use public expenditure to achieve some sort of social justice and a better distribution of the fruits of growth , as to the bottom 40 % of this country , '' Radwan said . \nAt the same time , he said , Egypt should n't sacrifice economic reforms and gains `` that enabled it to stand the storm of two successive crises -- the food crisis and the financial crisis . '' \nState television reported Monday that the crisis has cost the country an estimated 69 billion Egyptian pounds -LRB- nearly $ 12 billion -RRB- and set its economy back six months . \nMeanwhile , there are international indications that the world could accept a changed Egypt without Mubarak . \nIn Washington , U.S. officials have been calling for an `` orderly transition '' that will include free elections in September , when Mubarak 's current term expires . \n`` The United States government does not determine who 's on the ballot , '' White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters . \n`` The question is whether or not those elections are going to be free and fair . \nThat 's what we would weigh in on and weigh in on strongly . '' \nWhile it was widely believed Mubarak was grooming his son , Gamal , as his successor , that plan now has been complicated by demands for democracy . \nElBaradei is one of several opposition figures whose names surface when protesters talk about possible future leaders of Egypt . \nAnother possibility is Moussa , a veteran diplomat who was Mubarak 's foreign minister until 2001 . \nBut several opposition movements have been represented on the streets in the demonstrations , and Raoof said , `` There is no leader for the revolution . '' \n`` There is no political group leading the people . \nThere is no one leading the people . \nPeople are going in a very organic way ... people are just doing it . '' \nMounir Fakhry Abdel Nour , secretary-general of the Wafd Party , told CNN the group 's followers have been `` extremely active . '' \nIn Alexandria , an armored personnel carrier fired warning shots Monday as about 2,000 to 3,000 people gathered . \nThe shots were seen as an apparent effort to intimidate protesters near a hotel . \nWhile it 's difficult to ascertain a solid death toll during the violence , Human Rights Watch staffers have confirmed 80 deaths from two hospitals in Cairo , 36 deaths in Alexandria and 13 fatalities in Suez , said Human Rights Watch researcher Heba Morayef . \nThe unrest has paralyzed daily life in Egypt . \nMany essential supplies are running low , said Peter Bouckaert , Human Rights Watch emergencies director . \nGas stations throughout Cairo and Alexandria were closing because they were out of fuel . \nThe amount of goods in shops were low and many were rationing how much food people could buy . \nThe Egyptian stock exchange and banks were closed Monday , and the Moody 's ratings agency downgraded debt ratings for the country because of the turmoil . \nThere were long lines in front of bread shops and supermarkets , ATMs and gas stations were closed , and there was a minimal police presence . \nIn one neighborhood of Cairo , however , sanitation workers were seen collecting garbage . \nMen with makeshift weapons patrolled neighborhoods , creating checkpoints to fill the void left when police stopped patrolling the streets , and the self-appointed defense groups appear to be working closely with the military . \nSuez Canal authorities have said operations there are unchanged and the army is in control . \nHowever , shipping companies are predicting delays . \nAnd Egyptian soldiers are guarding the pyramids in Giza , one of the world 's top tourist draws . \nThere have been reports of prison breaks , and state-run Nile TV said Monday nearly 2,100 escaped inmates had been arrested . \nCNN 's Ben Wedeman , Frederik Pleitgen , Ivan Watson , Housam Ahmed , Caroline Faraj , Salma Abdelaziz , Saad Abedine , Christine Theodorou , Zain Verjee and journalist Ian Lee contributed to this report \n"}

'' \n`` The people of Sudan will not remain silent anymore . \nIt is about time we demand our rights and take what 's ours in a peaceful demonstration that will not involve any acts of sabotage , '' according an English-language version of the group 's profile on Facebook . \n`` We will demonstrate against the rising of the prices , the corruption , unemployment and all false practices of the government such as violence against women and lashing them in ways that breaks all laws of religions and humanity and the violation of minorities ' rights . '' \nThe Sudan Tribune newspaper , citing a statement from police , said 70 people , 40 of them students , were arrested after the protests . \nMeanwhile , a Facebook page has surfaced calling for a protest Thursday in Yemen , which has been the site of a few demonstrations already . \nThe Tunisian protests that sparked the region 's unrest sprang up after Mohamed Bouazizi , a 26-year-old college graduate , set himself on fire in protest of police confiscation of the fruit cart he had set up to make money . \nThe protests resulted in the collapse of Tunisia 's government and inspired similar protests in other countries , including Algeria , Jordan , Sudan and Yemen . \nThe protests have reached their zenith to date in Egypt , where untold thousands of Egyptians have ignored government curfews and clashed with police over demands that President Hosni Mubarak resign . \nA popular Facebook page that helped organize the Cairo protests was dedicated to Bouazizi . \n"}

{"id": "168", "time": "2011-01-31", "text": "CNN Student News - 2\\/1\\/11 Download PDF maps related to today 's show : THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT . \nCARL AZUZ , CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR : Hi , I 'm Carl Azuz , and you 're tuned in to CNN Student News ! \nA country in chaos ; the Midwest bracing for a blizzard : 10 minutes of commercial-free headlines start right now . \nAZUZ : Protesters ignoring a government curfew ; armed troops patrolling the streets ; daily supplies running low . \nIn a word , chaos . \nFor more than a week , people have been marching through the streets of Egypt , calling for long-time President Hosni Mubarak to step down . \nSome experts think this past week of protests could just be the calm before the storm . \nThere are reports that Egyptians are planning another wave of massive protests starting today in some of the nation 's major cities , like Cairo and Alexandria . \nThe Egyptian military has been called out to try to control the situation . \nYesterday , a military spokesman said the army wo n't use violence against the protesters , the troops are just there to help maintain security . \nThere have been times when protesters fought with security forces in the streets . \nWe 've gotten reports that more than 100 people have been killed in the violence , though it 's hard to confirm those kinds of numbers in a situation like this . \nEgyptians who are n't part of the protests are being affected , too . \nParts of the country are running low on things they need , like food and gas . \nAnd with police and security forces focused on the protests , some shops and businesses have been robbed , and there are reports of prison breaks . \nAs you can imagine , a lot of people are trying to get out , especially citizens of other countries who live or work in Egypt . \nThe U.S. State Department says there are more than 50,000 Americans in Egypt . \nThe agency 's working to arrange transportation out of the country for those folks . \nBut as we heard from one American , finding a way to leave can be very frustrating . \nLAURA MURPHY LEE , AMERICAN TOURIST IN EGYPT : You can not get away by water . \nYou can not take public transportation because it 's been deemed unsafe , and you can not fly . \nSo apparently , there are over 50,000 Americans in Egypt , some of whom may be flown out of the major cities . \nBut those of us who are not in Cairo or Alexandria , are trapped right now . \nAZUZ : There 's another aspect to what 's going on in Egypt , and it has to do with oil . \nEgypt is n't a major oil producer , but four-and-a-half percent of the entire world 's oil supply has to go through Egypt . \nStephanie Elam is here to help explain what kind of impact it might have if that flow of oil runs into any problems . \nSTEPHANIE ELAM , CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT : This is something that I know is like a world away for most Americans , but it could really have been an impact . \nAnd what we want to do is demonstrate for you just how key this region is , because you 've got the Suez Canal there , which is in Egypt . \nIt 's controlled by Egypt . \nAnd there 's also the Sumed pipeline . \nSo , let 's take a look first at the Suez Canal . \nYou can see right there that in 2009 , we know 1.8 million barrels a day flowed through the canal . \nYou also have the Sumed pipeline , which is just to the west of the Suez Canal . \nAnd through there , 1.1 million barrels a day actually flow through that pipeline . \nSo this artery , these two arteries , are just key for the region , because without this , what shippers would actually have to do is ship it all the way around Africa to get it over to Europe . \nAnd that would add 6,000 miles to the journey . \nNo doubt about it , a -RRB- that would cost a lot more . \nAnd b -RRB- it would also mess up with some supply and demand on when it would actually show up in Europe and the rest of the world that needs to get this key oil from such an important , oil-producing region . \nAZUZ : Taking you back to the U.S. now , where it has been a pretty rough winter so far . \nWe 've seen brutal snowstorms . \nDo n't even get me started talking about the airport . \nThere 've been hundreds of canceled and delayed flights . \nAnd here we go again . \nA major storm system is developing across the country . \nYesterday afternoon , Rob Marciano was tracking which parts of the U.S. could be affected and just how bad this might get . \nROB MARCIANO , CNN WEATHER ANCHOR : There 's over 20 states that are within a winter storm watch or advisory or winter storm warning , from New England all the way to New Mexico . \nThis is a huge system that 's going to affect tens of millions of people ; pretty much 3\\/4 of the country is under the gun here . \nAnd if you 're not in one of these winter weather advisories , you 're in the Southeast , which has had the heat built up for the past couple days , so there 's going to be some energy there for severe thunderstorms also . \nWinter storm warnings now posted for St. Louis back to Oklahoma City . \nWe could see anywhere from eight to 12 inches of snow down here . \nUp to Chicago , could see 12 to 18 inches of snow . \nThat is unbelievable for Chicago . \nAnd if that happens , if that verifies , we get 18 to 20 inches of snow , it 's going to be the worst snowstorm they 've seen in over ten years . \nAZUZ : February first : On this day in history in 1790 , the U.S. Supreme Court met for the first time in New York City . \nIn 1865 , President Abraham Lincoln signed a resolution sending the 13th Amendment , which would abolish slavery , to the states for ratification . \nIn 1960 , four African-Americans began a sit-in protest at a lunch counter in Greensboro , North Carolina after they were n't given service because of the store 's `` whites only '' policy . \nAnd in 2003 , the space shuttle Columbia broke up while re-entering the earth 's atmosphere , killing all seven crew members on board . \nMICHELLE WRIGHT , CNN STUDENT NEWS : Today 's Shoutout goes out to Ms. Grawburg 's business and marketing class from Monticello High School in Monticello , Minnesota ! \nIslamabad is the capital of what country ? \nYou know what to do ! \nIs it : A -RRB- Afghanistan , B -RRB- Oman , C -RRB- Pakistan or D -RRB- Saudi Arabia ? \nYou 've got three seconds -- GO ! \nIslamabad is the capital of Pakistan , the country with the world 's sixth-largest population . \nThat 's your answer and that 's your Shoutout ! \nREZA SAYAH , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT , ISLAMABAD : It 's a little after 8:00 in the morning , and we 're in the town of Daud Khel here in northwest Pakistan . \nWe drove four hours to get here from Islamabad . \nThis is Islamabad ; this is where we are in Daud Khel . \nA lot of the militant Taliban activity you hear about is here in the tribal region just west of us , and this is Afghanistan . \nWe came here to tell you the story of Rukhsana Batool . \nShe 's a 25-year-old mother , and every morning she wakes up , puts on her burqa -- a full-length Islamic veil -- and takes her two little boys to school . \nThat 's not so unusual . \nWhat happens next is . \nRukhsana does n't leave her kids at school . \nInstead , she sits right next to them in class and learns . \nThat 's because she 's enrolled in first grade with her kids . \nRUKHSANA BATOOL , FIRST GRADER MOM -LRB- TRANSLATED -RRB- : I used to bring my children to school , and I saw them studying , and I thought I really want to study and learn , too . \nSAYAH : A teacher here at the school says , for weeks , Rukhsana came to class because her kids would n't sit still . \nShe ended up liking it . \nHer parents had never sent her to school , so the teacher had an idea : why not enroll and come to class . \nAnd for Rukhsana , the decision was easy . \nMUREED FIZZA , RUKHSANA 'S TEACHER -LRB- TRANSLATED -RRB- : She was interested in studying and I welcomed that . \nI told her I would teach her , even if it meant taking up break time . \nSAYAH : Rukhsana gives her husband a lot of credit for encouraging her . \nRemember , illiteracy is a huge problem here in Pakistan . \nWhere we are it 's rare for little girls to go to school , let alone 25-year-old moms . \nOne study shows only one out of ten girls go to school in this province . \nSABIR HUSSAIN SHAH , RUKHSANA 'S HUSBAND -LRB- TRANSLATED -RRB- : I think women in every country should be educated . \nIf she 's getting educated , then our family will be much more enlightened as well . \nFIZZA -LRB- TRANSLATED -RRB- : My opinion is that one of the main solutions to all of the issues we have in this country is the education of women . \nI think if one woman is educated , her entire family will be educated . \nSAYAH : Their teacher says one of Rukhsana 's boys could be sharper than she is . \nSome friendly competition between mom and her two little boys in first grade . \nReza Sayah , CNN , Daud Khel , Pakistan . \nAZUZ : It 's only on CNN you 'd see a story like that . \nWell , our last story on this first day of February : We want you to check out this nature film . \nWatch , as the majestic silverback gorilla strolls across the wilds of the Serengeti . \nHold on a second , since when do gorillas stroll ?! This one does . \nAnd he 's not on the Serengeti . \nHe 's in a British animal park . \nThe 21-year-old has become a pseudo-celebrity because of this YouTube video that shows off how he walks upright . \nWe 're not sure how he learned it ; it might 've been because he was watching how his human keepers walked on two legs ... AZUZ : ... and then he just aped their behavior . \nWe 're sure a unique skill like that gives him a leg up on the other gorillas . \nSo he should definitely be proud ; you know , stand tall . \nI can hear you groaning from here . \nHe wrote us , `` A pun a day keeps laughter on its way . '' \nWe 'd love for you to send us your sign-off line . \nWe 're gonna keep doing these ; we 're having a good time with them , and we enjoy what you have to say . \nHave a great day . \nFor CNN Student News , I 'm Carl Azuz . \n"}
{"id": "135", "time": "2011-01-31", "text": "As popular uprisings sweep the Middle East , it 's hard to underestimate the role played by social media and new technology . \nTwitter , Facebook , YouTube , cell phones and even cable news outlets are putting a tremendous amount of power right into the hands of the people . \nAnd do n't think for a second that the rest of the Arab world is n't watching . \nFor starters , these communication tools allow ordinary citizens to plan and organize protests in a way that was unthinkable just a few years ago . \nThey can spread the word about mass protests , ensuring more people will show up . \nIn turn , the sheer size of some of these protests makes it close to impossible for officials to stop them . \nThanks to Facebook and Twitter , these protests are n't happening in a vacuum as they might have decades ago . \nWhen young Egyptians take to the streets by the thousands , the world is seeing it and hearing about it in real time through texts , tweets , pictures and videos . \nIt 's also why governments , such as those in Egypt or Iran , have tried to crack down on the internet and some of these websites . \nIn the case of Egypt , social media sites have also put pressure on Washington to act more quickly . \nWith so much information leaking out , it became impossible for the U.S. to downplay what was going on and stay out of it . \nNo surprise that other dictators in the Middle East are worried . \nAnd they should be - they could be next . \nInterested to know which ones made it on air ? \nThis is great news . \nWell , the actual news is n't great , but the idea of social media is . \nGovernments and large businesses no longer have total control over the media and public opinion . \nThis is a great counterbalance to the power struggle in the world . \nDictatorships can only thrive when they can control information . \nAs long as those who are being repressed can find a way to get the information out , the dictators will have a hard time and will likely crumble all the more quickly . \nSocial media is only one way to spread information . \nAs long as the internet exists , there will be ways to use it . \nI think we are witnessing the end of the totalitarian state as a form of governance . \nSome in the news media are leading viewers to conclude that the Egyptian protesters are mostly secular , non-violent , not anti-American , and somewhat more Westernized than protesters we have seen in other Arab countries . \nTo that end , where are the Egyptian women protestors ? \nI 've seen only men . \nThis instant technology is wonderful . \nIt shows the whole world in real time what monsters govern these countries . \nAfter 30 years of repression , Mubarak is doomed . \nMy only hope is that democracy will take over . \nIt seems democracy would be the logical choice since Facebook and Twitter are the very essence of free speech . \nSocial media are redefining the dynamics of popular revolt . \nThe need for a central figure to drive a revolution is replaced by the collective consciousness of the masses . \nIf we had had all this technology back in the 1960s and 1970s , how different the U.S. would be today ! \nJust think how many folks would have shown up for MLK , the March on Washington and our own Days of Rage . \nAnd what would have happened at Kent State ? \nJack : Social media allows the story to get out about Egypt 's struggle for freedom . \nSocial media allows people to communicate with other people who have freedoms , and this comparison brings on an uprising . \nGradual freedom brings on an evolution of democracy , but Egypt has been struggling for 30 years . \nWe are witnessing the Egyptian people bring about more freedom for itself and its children . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 1:59 pm | Instability in the middle east , will offer more opportunities for Al-Queda , and their sympathizers , to gain more control over people , and become an even greater danger to the free world . \nIt is highly unlikely that any type of westernized democracy will evolve , in that part of the world , due to the religious oppression . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 2:02 pm | Jack you are saying that if I use social media and can get enough people to agree with me I can put pressure on the American government to do something , even though I 'm from another country . \nThat is just wrong . \nHow long has the world been telling the US to shut up and but out ? \nEver sense the Korean war ended . \nDid you ever listen ? \nNo , so how in the name of god is facebook , twitter and whatever going to make America do anything ? \nWhat these things do is circumvent people like you and Wolf . \nBy sharing person to person or using social media we take the TV media spin out of the equation and are left to judge events by ourselves . \nThat 's what scares politicians and the news media the most . \nPeople getting the actual facts without spin control . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 2:07 pm | the everyman has a voice and is using it . \nWould n't it be ironic if the population in all these countries rose up and found there voice and installed a true democracy . \nNot a capitalist society but a true democracy where the citizen is elected not the warlord . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 2:15 pm | I think the social media has affected the modern uprising in a big way . \nBefore a dictatorship could shut everything down and run everyone out of town . \nThen use what any means necessary to shut down the uprising in total darkness . \nWith today 's modern technology there always seems to be a way for the news and pictures to get out in real time . \nThe protesters are able to stay in touch with one another and become better organized . \nMaking it hard for dictators to stay in control of their country . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 2:22 pm | You betcha Jack , Social Media and technology are the driving forces behind the spread of current social and political revolutions in the Middle East and North Africa . \nThe genie is out of the bottle and the news of these revolutions have gone viral since Tunisia exploded . \nArab and other third world leaders are now on notice : Institute democratic and economic reforms or prepare to be removed from positions of leadership because other forces are waiting in the wings to assume power . \nThe same message applys to leaders of the developed world as well . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 2:23 pm | The more people communicate with each other , and share ideas and ideals . \nThe more we 'll find out just how small this world really is . \nWe are now seeing that basic human rights out weigh all of human greed and corruption . \nWe are seeing that were all not that much different from each other . \nWe all want was is right . \nThe Middle Eastern people want basic human freedoms , employment , freedom to speak your mind , to peacefully assemble , to vote for it 's leaders . \nDemocracy is a good thing , until special interests have their way . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 2:26 pm | People use the tools to which they have access . \nBe it word of mouth , flyers , Morse Code , smoke signals , or social media , people with grievences find a way to be seen and heard . \nThink of how fast we will get our information in another 50 years . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 2:28 pm | Power to the people . \nWho 's next , the US and our Congress ? \nCould be if they do n't wake up . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 2:36 pm | It works both ways Jack . \nTo use social media to protest peacefully it is a wonderful thing . \nTo use social media to gather unlawfully and for unlawful purposes is quite another . \nWhere the problem comes in is when people use social media to manipulate people and opinion . \nWho knows if what is being put on Facebook is true and accurate and it could incite riots . \nAn angry mob is an ugly thing and innocent people tend to get hurt . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 2:52 pm | It has allowed the people to speak louder than the dictators . \nWe need more social media and uprisings until we achieve social equality , and the world has a long ways to go before we reach social equality ! \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 2:53 pm | They have done so in ways that the affected dictators could not have imagined in their worst nightmares . \nAnd that goes for some of our own lawmakers and politicians right here . \nThe last presidential election proved that . \nTrust me , our leaders are working overtime to figure out a way to shut down the internet at will . \nThey forget that it was designed several decades ago -LRB- when people were a lot smarter -RRB- to be able to survive a nuclear attack . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 2:53 pm | Social media & technology is here & will only continue to become more & more advanced . \nYes , we are able to observe what is happening all across the world by the click of a mouse or our T.V. remote . \nThe bottom line is not due to either of these tools . \nThese protests & uprisings are not limited to the Middle East . \nIts happening in many parts of the world & the reason is always because of corrupt Government . \nPeople have become frustrated & tired of their corrupt lawmakers & are now insisting it comes to an abrupt halt . \nI hate to say it , and I hope I 'm wrong , but i 'm thinking the U.S. is sitting on the doorstep of protest & uprising if the Government does ` nt get its bussiness in order . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 2:53 pm | Jack : It allows the `` freedom of thought '' to be deposited into others ! \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 2:54 pm | Lizzie 's husband Ken In California You betcha it has Jack . \nThe social media and technology has given us instant information faster than it takes for the tears on John Boehner s face to dry . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 2:59 pm | Social media have made organizing protests much easier and more widespread . \nThe downside is that they can veer off in unexpected directions , control being taken by the most organized . \nOne need only look at the Russian revolution , an early example of media involvement in political uprising that was usurped by the organized Bolshevik party , and the Iranian revolution , another media fueled uprising , similarly usurped by an organized minority , the mullahs with their radical Islamist policies , contrary to the goals of the majority of those involved . \nWe can only hope that the forces for democracy are at the forefront of the unrest in Egypt and not Islamic radicals aligned with Hezbollah or similar violent groups . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 3:07 pm | CNN is leading its viewers to conclude that the Egyptian protestors are mostly secular , non-violent , not anti-American , and somewhat more Westernized than protesters we have seen in other Arab countries . \nTo that end where are the Egyptian women protestors ? \nI 've seen only men . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 3:21 pm | I think one big factor , as we saw in Iran during their protests , is that uplinks to the likes of Twitter , Facebook and YouTube makes it almost impossable for the people in power to censor the news of what is happening . \nthey can no longer just cut off traditional media and hope the truth does n't get out . \nthis is a GOOD thing and gives new meaning to `` the whole world is watching '' . \nand as a side note to this same technology , Jack , secretive organizations like the US Military and State Department are also subject to having their `` dirty laundry '' being `` aired in public '' like the Reuters journalists being murdered by that US Army Apache helicopter crew in Iraq . \nthis is ALSO a good thing for OUR democracy . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 3:23 pm | Too much technology is not always a good thing . \nIn this case , it seems to escalate an already almost impossible situation . \nThere is alot of power in social networking and all people should use the powers of this technology for the greater good ... in a perfect world . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 3:27 pm | It 's not as easy for dictators to use brute force and mass killings and get away with it . \nNow the world will find out . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 3:29 pm | They facilitate communications among disparate groups . \nUnfortunately , they can be corrupted by people trying to sway popular opinion with mass-messaging , faux-tweets , and the like which might be coming from anywhere - Russia , China , Iran , here . \nSomeday , we 're going to learn the hard way that there are limits to the reliability of social media when they are serupticiously corrupted for ideological gain . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 3:29 pm | The social media has facilitaed uprisngs . \nFree expression is good but the eisting sources are not without a downside . \nAnything can be sais and no need of reguard for the truth . \nIt may be becessry to enact penalities for publishing false info on social media . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 3:35 pm | I would limit to affects of social media to just popular uprisings . \nsocial media was used in an unprecedented constructive way with President Obama 's 2008 presidential campaign strategy . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 3:41 pm | My father in law was a political prisoner in Egypt and Americans just need to understand the down right hatred the Egyptian people have for their government and just how bad Mubarak IS . \nThey have went through a 30 year `` bailout '' with Mubarak and his henchmen acting as the `` Wallstreet banks . '' \nAs a paratrooper and Desert Storm vet , I applaud the Egyptian army for its professionalism-they do all solidiers proud . \nTo the Egyptian people I say ELFA MABRUKE ! \n-LRB- `` a thousand congratulations '' -RRB- for standing up for yourselves . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 3:52 pm | I would not limit the affects of social media to just popular uprisings . \nSocial media was used in an unprecedented and constructive way with President Obama 's 2008 presidential campaign strategy . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 3:54 pm | I believe that effective parenting and responsible education in creating mature , self-reliant and problem-solving human beings will augment and transcend the problems of the world . \nBeing responsible , armed with technology and state-of-the-art communication is imperative for civil unrest . \n, as well as creatively solving the problems of the world . \nHumans will always create new and innovative ways to communicate , from the early telegraphs to our modern technology . \nBut I 'll bet we 're still argueing about the same stuff the cavemen grunted at each other about : Who get to be in charge and who gets the most stuff . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 4:11 pm | El Baradei and the new Egypt 's own founding fathers and mothers are taking their turn moving humanity forward in our political , social , and spiritual evolution . \nHuman beings are making progress everyday . \nYes we all can . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 4:16 pm | Remo , from beautiful downtown Pflugerville Texas With knowledge comes power . \nPower to determine one 's destiny , power to determine how one 's country should be . \nPower to understand that things can change . \nI hope the knowledge they have will help them determine a government that is for the good of all people and not something to `` settle the score with '' . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 4:22 pm | Not sure of a question here but the advent of cyber-tech social media has indeed linked people and the world together resulting in ... ... ... ... . \ngovernments can fool some of the people some of the time but they can no longer fool ALL of the people ALL of the time . \nI do n't mind the tweeting , facebook etc. . \nbut I sure wish that Television would only carry it on the hour , not 24 hours a day . \nI am so sick of seeing whatever the breaking news is , being on for a week or more . \nWe can not police the world . \nThe sooner we learn that the better . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 4:26 pm | If social networking and wikileaks were the cause of revolts , we may as well replace our spy agencies with nerds and hackers . \nBut that 's not the case . \nThe food costs and housing issues have been a problem for a very long time . \nI could tell you some very disturbing first-hand stories about lack of affordable food , housing , migration , and oppression in Egypt . \nJust one : right outside Cairo , a train derailed and came to rest some distance from the tracks . \nBefore the authorities could clean up the wreckage , people moved into the more intact cars to live . \nThe authorities let them be . \nFrankly , I am surprised that Egyptians had not risen up long ago . \nIMO , they are just a tad timid and got inspired by what happened in Tunisia . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 4:30 pm | The need for freedom lives in all of us , the rise of social media in the last decade has given voice to that ; the need to dominate and control lives only in people governed by greed . \nNo media can make that look good . \nAll dictators should start looking for new jobs now , do n't wait till it 's too late like Mubarik . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 4:30 pm | technology is only a tool which was used to spread the unrest in the middle east and Africa . \nthe minds of the people in these areas is the fuel of the unrest . \nthe people must make up their mind how the future of their country will go . \nthe world needs to watch or observe with out inserting their mind set on those people . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 4:35 pm | This is great news . \nWell , the actual news is n't great , but the idea of social media is . \nGovernments and large businesses no longer have total control over the media , and public opinion . \nThis is a great counter-balance to the power struggle in the world . \nAnd , of course , the ones who are losing their coveted power are trying to control the information . \nOh I 'm sorry , is it inconvenient to you to have some light shed on your nation ? \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 4:52 pm | The internet has been an important too for political freedom all over the world . \nRight now the internet is off in Egypt , cell phones were stopped as well for awhile but are now back on . \nAnd Egypt has closed the Al Jazeera office from broadcasting . \nOppressive governments better get on board . \nAll their days are numbered . \nThey can either work for their people or their people will depose them . \nI hardly think Twitter and Facebook are the strengths behind these Middle Eastern protests . \nThey may be contributing factors and the US Media uses them and probably gives them too much credit . \nMost of the people in Egypt are poor , extremely poor , and do n't have computers , smartphones , and much less have internet . \nSo , you can see Tweets scrowling all day but that does n't mean there 's millions of people paying attention to them . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:02 pm | Social media has simply revolutionized most aspect of American life . \nIt has helped spread information , express freedom of speech and religion , boosted the economy and the countless list continues . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:08 pm | Dictatorships can only thrive when they can control information . \nAs long as those who are being repressed can find a way to get the information out , they will have a hard time and will likely crumble all the more quickly . \nSocial Media is only one way to spread information . \nAs long as the internet exists , there will be ways to use it . \nI think we are witnessing the end of the totalitarian state as a form of governance . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:10 pm | Social media certainly can play a role to an extent , but countries who have a tight reign on media control , such as Iran and China , certainly have the ability to limit their effects . \nJust another example that those nations that simply do n't care about individual freedom have the greatest advantage in setting their own agendas . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:16 pm | Its the `` end of the world '' as we know it Jack . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:18 pm | `` An uneducated public is the dictator 's biggest friend '' ? \nYou do n't say ? \nI think we 're in real trouble right here in River City then . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:19 pm | A better question -- What would have happened if we had had this type of media during Viet Nam ? \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:19 pm | Well Jack , Dictators do try to keep the public away from information . \nI think , Egypt , only allows CNN Situation Room to be broadcast in Cairo . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:19 pm | simply put technology has brought people alot more closer than before , good and bad . \ninformation gets to where it goes much more faster and more reliable . \nthe youth this time have the better idea on how the world should work and the old are just scrambling to get the idea on how to use the internet like we do . \nthis is a revolution . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | Technology has changed the human evolution . \nTwitter , Youtube , Ireport are all what we call the Mobile Activism . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | This instant tech is wonderful . \nIt shows the whole world in real time what monster govern these countries . \nAfter 30 years of repression Mubarak is doomed My only hope is that democracy will take over . \nIt would seem that democracy would be the logical choice since Facebook and Twitter are the very essense of free speech . \nThere are times when it seems like the quickness is too quick , but knowing the truth can only help . \nNow Obama has to step up , tell Mubarak to leave and help the Egyptians form a real , democratic government . \nSend Carter to broker elections . \nBut Hell we have to help . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | I believe this social websites will eventually be the means of helping people across the globe identify with each other . \nThis uprising in Egypt being discussed through these websites , shows us that we all have similar needs despite culture differences . \nFreedom and equality are key principles that are valued and spread through social networks like Facebook and YouTube . \nThanks to them , I believe it may be possible to gain world peace . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:21 pm | OMG -- if we had had all this technology back in the 1960s and 1970s , how different the United States would be today ! \nJust think how many folks would have shown up for MLK , the March on Washington and our own Days of Rage ... and what would have happened at Kent State ? \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:21 pm | Social media is redefining the dynamics of people revolt . \nThe need for a central figure to drive a revolution is replaced by the collective consciousness of the masses . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:21 pm | I believe these social websites will eventually be the means of helping people across the globe identify with each other . \nThis uprising in Egypt being discussed through these websites , shows us that we all have similar needs despite culture differences . \nFreedom and equality are key principles that are valued and spread through social networks like Facebook and YouTube . \nThanks to them , I believe it may be possible to gain world peace . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:21 pm | It means to me , governments of all countries should realize that the young will find a way to communicate and the chips will fall in many directions . \nWe America may also see that the government is not always forthcoming in our own country , when we use words like force our leaders , to recognize it 's responsibility . \nWhy are we giving 1.3 billion dollars a year to a country that is a country we are fighting on human rights . \nand how many more countries are we paying dollars too , that could pay down are own national debt and help us clean up debt we are in from fighting wars in obscure countries . \nI think I 'll go twitter and find out how many more countries we have been paying for generations while one in 5 Americans go to bed hunger and with out health care . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:21 pm | Free communication has got to scare the living -- out of tyrants , autocrats , etc. . \nWhen people are able to communicate and say what they truly think without fear , it 's the dawning of freedom . \nAs a person wiser than me once said , freedom truly comes when you are willing to risk your life for liberty , equality , human rights ... January 31 , 2011 at 5:21 pm | I Do n't Think The Social Media Has Affected Anything Going On In Egypt It Just Makes Everyone More Aware Of What 's Going On ! \nThe Only True Way I Really Know What 's Been Going In Egypt Is From CNN And The Internet Plain And Simple ! \nMy Thoughts Are With The Egyptians ! \nAmerica with all of our problems and imperfections is still what other countries strive to be like . \nFreedom to select our leaders and chart our own course is the very basis of what it means to be free . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:22 pm | ... from Alexandria , Virginia . \nCould this sort of thing happen in the United States ? \nI hope not , because the Religious Right might seize power . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:23 pm | Too bad American news media is n't taking advantage . \nWe have to see what 's going on in Egypt on Al Jazeera 's live stream . \nMakes you wonder whose controlling the `` news . '' \nMaybe we would be better served if the media was n't corporate owned . \nWe 'd be better off if a lot of what goes on here in the US was n't corporate owned , actually . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:23 pm | Jack , remember what I told you during Iranian uprising ? \nThat nothing is going to happen immediately . \nWhat happened , the dictorial regime survived in Iran and so will the current regime in Egypt . \nSocial media is definitely playing a role , but you have to understand that Middle Easterners are volatile peple , social media or not . \nWe in America are lucky that Republican Party is not in charge here , otherwise you would have been hearing offensive words : Death to America January 31 , 2011 at 5:23 pm | Tucson , AZ -- The new media have affected popular uprisings the way gasoline affects a fire . \nConsider how long it took for the French Revolution to proceed from food riots , to storming the Bastille , to deposing the King -- weeks ! \nThe Tunisians accomplished much more in a mere four days ! \nWe will see how long before Mubarak resigns and leaves Egypt in the hands of his newly appointed VP and cabinet ... I give it most another seven days , and that is only because the Egyptians , not being Arabs , are a bit less volatile . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:23 pm | Perhaps the real question is would our governments shut down our use of the social media should any city see a mass revolt that local police forces could not control ? \nEgypt is going to more than a history lesson as we have no idea of the final outcome . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:24 pm | History is being rewritten because of the social networks and we get to watch . \nAs far as the US goes -- we 're in a somewhat compromising situation . \nThis is what happens when you get in bed with a Dictator . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:25 pm | As much as I hate to quote Marshall MCluhan , where Social Networking is concerned , `` The Medium is the Message , '' fits the bill . \nWhat we need to look at is not ourselves as passive observers but when we are part of the events that unfold for others to witness on Social Medias . \nThose involved in a thing do not need to necessarily need to be educated so much as they need the affirmation that others , perhaps silently , have felt the same way about experiencing the same things . \nThis may mean that Radio could have been just as effective as Social Networking is the same way we were and are able to listen to Sports Play by play . \nThe Danger in North America especially is that Social Media may actually inhibit free expression and hand over the organization of Social action to the Medium of Organization itself . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:25 pm | Social media networks are simply helping the protestors take it to the next level . \nWith this on the peoples side , it is easier for them to revolt . \nIt 's a tool that the younger generation has seemed to find a good use for twitter and facebook . \nIt 's catching people off and it 's great to see people se these networks for a greater cause then boasting about their hangover they received from the night before . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:26 pm | I fear that what is happening now in the Middle East\\/Egypt is more like the change in Iran than any other analogy . \nWhat do you think ? \nWhatever Jimmy Carter says , I 'm sure is gospel . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:26 pm | As I make dinner for my Iranian-American husband , our daughter and her Armenian heritage boyfriend , I 'm struck by the notion that Facebook , Twitter , and 24\\/7 news coverage is but a giant dose of truth serum that is long overdue in the world . \nPerhaps this chronic condition of dictators deciding for the great unwashed is at last in the crosshairs of a cure -- thousands of voices reaching millions of eyes and ears . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:28 pm | 1-Mubarak out price for the lives lost so far . \n2 - President is commander of military even if he has no military experience - max 2 terms ... 3 - parliament depends on the city or governate population -- max 3 terms ... 5-all three must be separated in power and also watch each other efficiency . \n6-Freedom of speech , religion and assembly . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:29 pm | Social Media is very powerful tool for the freedom . \nNow we know what we can do with social network . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:29 pm | When people do the wrong thing , no matter how severe it is . \nThey would prefer that , not very many people know about it . \nWith the Technology today , The act of wronging people is extremely more difficult and the more severe the act , the more the exposure is given to the act . \nThe important thing for the wrong doer , is how they accept their exposure and correct the Wrong , ie Make it right . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:30 pm | The Internet , Facebook and all other social network have proven how effective these tools could be . \nIt took 5 days for Egypt to have a vice - president after a wait of 30 years thanks to FB and TW . \nLong gone are the days of `` Extra , Extra '' or `` Breaking News '' . \nEven Cable news ca n't keep up with the pace . \nAt the rate news and events are changing one should not be surprise that by the end of summer their might be only one of two dictatorship left . \nLet you guess who these might be ! \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:31 pm | jack i think a lot of countrys should be watching . \npeople should be treated equal you know our country started slavery so you know they do n't think people should be treated equel this country is greety so like i said the governments want to enslave people so people need to wake up . \ni think there should be no rich people . \nyou ca n't even get into poltics unless you have a lot of money so all you end up with running the country is greety old men give the young people a chance bet we would have a different country . \na better country stop using oil and use the sun and wint to run our world . \nluke January 31 , 2011 at 5:31 pm | It is great that we now have social media to assist us in informing the world on what goes on in different countries . \nIt gives the people of Egypt , for instance , a bigger voice , that way , they know they 'll be heard & people can take action quickly . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:32 pm | The impact of social and new media will only continue to give rise to the reality of a new `` global village , '' where humanity 's connections are finally realized , and the voices of the people - through online content - get to write the first draft of history . \nWith Internet penetration up in Africa over 1800 % since 2000 , it will give autocratic and totalitarian regimes serious concerns to keep their growing populations on the other side of the digital divide . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:33 pm | The social media has brought everyone to the same place in sec onds ... these dictators can no longer hide . \nWe are watching an oppressed people wake up and gain their freedom ... Mubarek is 82 years old , Why wont he go away ? \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:33 pm | Jack , This is a game changer for everyone , governments can not control the masses like they use to , and it would appear social networking sites have given the masses away to communicate and the collective effect of `` saftey in numbers '' , gives the masses courage . \nsomething without facebook and twitter would be impossible . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:34 pm | Could this happen in the United States ? \nI hope not because the radical christians could seize power . \nBob T. in Alexandria , Virgina January 31 , 2011 at 5:35 pm | Jack , what good is the `` social media '' if the dictator shuts down the Internet , like Mubarak did ? \nAnd , tweets are bogus because the dictator 's buddies could be tweeting propaganda as a form of missinformation . \nWithout the Internet and the streaming videos coming live from the streets from people 's Internet-connected cellphones , any information from the `` social media '' can not be taken as `` fact '' . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:35 pm | Jack , I think the social media is great in this instance . \nThe Arab world has been guilty of forcing it 's populations into the stone age for far to long . \nI think now they realize that the people have power and that the dictators have a whole new set of problems . \nI hope this snowball continues rolling down the hill and takes the dictators with it . \nPeace , integrity , freedom , rights and self esteem to the people ! \n-LRB- including women ! -RRB- \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:36 pm | Even in Alpine MT , winter population ONE , there is something glaringly obvious . \nOur media are fixated on -LRB- 1 -RRB- public statements by our administration , and -LRB- 2 -RRB- immediate implications and results . \nDiplomacy that counts is done in back rooms . \nConsequences of diplomacy usually take months to `` mature . '' \nCurrent talks between Egyptian VP and opposition will facilitate a change without us engaging in regime change and without Mubarek having to publicly capitulate . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:36 pm | Jack , we ca n't have it both ways . \nWe condemn gov ` ts because their leaders `` do n't want the public to know anything , '' yet we also condemn Wikileaks for doing that very thing ... informing the public of what gov ` ts are doing . \nCa n't have cake and eat it too ! \nThere are parts of the World that most of us will never see other than on a travel channel which only details the beautiful landscape of the country . \nSocial media gives a greater indepth of the lives of the people that we know nothing about and would be hidden from us if we ever traveled this country . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:42 pm | I wish democracy , freedom , and justice for everyone but why is it that everyone point 's fingers at President Obama when another country has problems ? \nNot just Egypt who I am praying for but any country or nation . \nOur country has its own problems and we 're still working on that right now while making steady progress . \nBush made a mistake by interfering when we invaded Iraq to take over and look at how that ended . \nA lot of people expect the US to act as the big brother for other countries out there and take over . \nI understand that what other countries do can sometimes affect us but what they do is really none of our business to a certain extent . \nThis is between the people of Egypt and their government . \nObama is the President of the United States , not the World . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:44 pm | This could be real '' Power to the People '' , Jack . \nAn underground movement for regular people moving at light speed . \nCourage can be given to thousands that not dare to dream before ... . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:46 pm | Female - from the Equality State Yes , that is a great point . \nWhere are the women in all these spontaneous shots from social media of the new technology ???? Could these modern Arabs still not believe women are equal ? \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:47 pm | The events in Tunisia and Egypt are flash democracy . \nText messaging , the internet , Twitter and Facebook have been used to make flash mobs which are humorous and entertaining , but with no significant impact or meaning . \nNow , the concept has evolved into flash democracy , the spontaneous development of significant demonstrations and protestations of a country 's populace for political change . \nWho knows where it will end ? \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:47 pm | Edmund K. -LRB- Deak -RRB- Brehl , J.D. , Ll . \nM. I have always genuinely believed that the 1990 fall of communist Russia was brought about more by the communications explosion than by the ` outspending ' of the former USSR in defense matters . \nBasically , you ca n't hide the truth . \nThis sea change is now occuring in Egypt . \nI was an Obama supporter , but I am very disenchanted in how the President is handling this situation . \nWe 're betting -LRB- as a nation -RRB- on the wrong horse - there needs to be a regime change in Egypt , and if we do n't take a side in favor of the Egyptian people we risk a rebuke by all of the peoples in the Mid-East who view the United States as only being interested in U.S. economic issues as opposed to properly being interested in worldwide humanistic issues . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:48 pm | If the U.S.A. `` really does n't want to get involved in Egyptian politics '' , perhaps we should think twice or three times before supplying a foreign country with tanks and weapons . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:51 pm | If the uprising will lead to : 1 -RRB- more democracy -- less dictatorship , 2 -RRB- more equality -- less Arab racism and apartheid -LRB- against non-Arabs or agaisnt non-pure-Arabs -RRB- , 3 -RRB- more honesty -- less `` unifiying the Arab world only by pseudo blaming the west and Zionists for its own fault , '' 4 -RRB- more freedom -- less totalitarianism , 5 -RRB- more tolereance -- less anti-semitism , then , that 's a good thing . \nHowever , if radical Islam will abuse this ` breach ' of security to further its ` Islamic domination ' goal , than , that world sees an even more bleak future . \nMoreso in face of Islamic Republic of Iran 's global aspirations and actions , the Mullahcracy that loves to stir rouble all over the world especially in the M.E. and gained some succcess - recently - in Lebanon despite anti-Hezbollah pro-freedom protests there . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:52 pm | You know it would be a good idea if CNN went back to giving us at least an hour of international news as it used to at noon . \nI believe more Americans are becoming dumbed down and do n't get to witness what goes on outside of our country anymore . \nThose that live abroad have a better idea of what is going on in the world . \nA short while back this was not the case - the media should be educating the Americans as to what goes on outside of our circle . \nI would like to see CNN go back to that and I would also like to see intelligent discussions on cable channels instead of punditry fighting January 31 , 2011 at 5:54 pm | Social Media is just another tool to communicate . \nIt can gather a crowd but the nation wide mass movement only happens when the mass media get involved and amplify its impact . \nBut beware ... witness the mass misinformation by the right , and left , but mostly the right , on the web -- mass hysteria . \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:54 pm | Why will this raise pump prices . \nWhen I was young we had fuel shortages and long lines for gas at stations , but never a price increase . \nWhy increase the price before there is a shortage . \ndays of this the big news story is enough already . \nsocial media will be used in this country for the same thing as what is going on in egypt . \nthe people their have had enough of the 2 class living standards . \nthe haves and the have nots is what is really going on ! \nthe 1 % of the top richest people should be watching whats happening in egypt so they know were they are taking this country were greed becomes our new god ! \nthe constitution says it supports the common good of the country Ronald Raegan replsced those words with the common greed of the country which will be the start of of what you see in egypt right here ! \nJanuary 31 , 2011 at 5:56 pm | Jack Cafferty sounds off hourly on the Situation Room on the stories crossing his radar . \nNow , you can check in with Jack online to see what he 's thinking and weigh in with your own comments online and on TV . \nWould you ride in a car that drives itself ? \nIs she the answer ? \nShould the #LoneStarState be allowed to withdraw from U.S. ? \n"}
{"id": "19", "time": "2011-01-30", "text": "Egyptian demonstrators demanding the resignation of President Mubarak carry the body of a dead protestor past army tanks . \nWith unprecedented numbers of protesters on the streets of Egypt calling for President Hosni Mubarak to resign , what clues do earlier demonstrations in the region offer about what will happen in Cairo ? \nTunisia , a relatively small and apparently stable country on the Mediterranean , triggered the current wave of anti-government protests across the Middle East . \nIt had been ruled by President Zine El Abedine Ben Ali for 23 years and was seen as a well-established police state . \nBut in December 2010 , a fruit seller named Mohamed Bouazizi , 26 , set himself on fire in protest after police took away his fruit cart . \nThe profoundly symbolic act of protest awakened a suppressed fury in the population . \nPresident Ben Ali visited Bouazizi 's hospital bedside -- the college graduate lived for three weeks before dying January 4 -- but he was unable to assuage the nation 's rage at decades of corruption , low living standards and grinding repression . \nAfter weeks of protests in which more than 100 people died , according to the United Nations , Ben Ali fled the country on January 14 . \nLongtime Prime Minister Mohamed Ghannouchi took the reins of power and created a national unity government , including both members of the old guard and opposition . \nBut the people demanded fuller reform , and Ghannouchi has continued to shuffle the government to try to appease an angry populace . \nNew presidential elections have been promised within 60 days of Ben Ali 's flight . \nThat 's a dramatically different outcome from what happened in Iran a year and a half earlier , when huge protests erupted after presidential elections in June 2009 . \nMany Iranians expected the defeat of incumbent hardline President Mahmoud Ahamdinejad , but official results showed him as the winner . \nIncredulous at the outcome and determined to overturn it , Iranians took to the streets , declaring that a `` Sea of Green '' -- the color of Islam -- would force Ahmadinejad out of power . \nThe apparent revolution captured the imagination of the world , especially after a young woman , Neda Agha-Soltan , was killed by a bullet to the chest during a demonstration . \nThe last moments of her life were caught on a shaky video that was seen by millions after it was posted online . \nBut Iranian security forces cracked down hard . \nThe government-backed plainclothes militia known as the Basij waded into demonstrations with motorcycles and clubs , and untold numbers of protesters were rounded up and thrown into prison . \n"}

{"id": "190", "time": "2011-01-30", "text": "CNN Student News - 1\\/31\\/11 Download PDF maps related to today 's show : THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT . \nCARL AZUZ , CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR : It is the very last day of January , but the very first day of a new week of CNN Student News ! \nI 'm Carl Azuz . \nIf you took a look at the news at all this weekend , you probably know what our top story today is . \nThe world is watching as a political crisis engulfs the north African nation . \nProtesters have been marching through the streets for days . \nThey 're speaking out against the Egyptian government , and specifically against long-time President Hosni Mubarak . \nThe protesters say they have two demands . \nOne : They want President Mubarak to leave office and to be put on trial . \nTwo : They want to change the country 's constitution . \nThe government has been trying different ways to get these protests under control . \nIt 's established a curfew ; it 's sent out fighter jets and thousands of security troops . \nAs you can see , it does n't seem to be making any difference . \nThe protests lasted through Sunday night and looked like they could keep going for a while . \nIn different cities around the world , other people are holding rallies in support of Egypt 's protesters . \nBusinesses and governments that have offices in Egypt are working to evacuate their citizens and clients from the country . \nPresident Mubarak went on TV over the weekend to talk to the people of Egypt . \nHe said he understands why they 're upset , including their concerns over alleged government corruption and desire for better living conditions . \nMubarak asked his government ministers to resign , but said he plans to say in power . \nBut that 's not enough for the man you see here : Mohamed ElBaradei , a prominent Egyptian and holder of a Nobel Peace Prize . \nHe 's a leader of the largest group that 's against President Mubarak . \nAnd on Sunday , he urged the Egyptian president to `` leave today and save the country . '' \nElBaradei says the push for Mubarak to step down is `` non-negotiable . '' \nAZUZ : All right , we 're gonna talk about some of the major players in all of this in today 's Breakdown . \nFirst off , Egypt 's leader , Hosni Mubarak . \nHe 's been the country 's president since 1981 . \nEgypt 's president serves six-year terms with no term limits , which is why he 's been in power so long . \nThe country is a republic , with the president chosen by popular vote . \nBut here 's the kicker : Until 2005 , Mubarak was the only candidate on the ballot ! \nIn 2005 , Mubarak beat out a couple other candidates when he got almost 90 percent of the vote . \nAnother election is scheduled for later this year . \nThe country Mubarak leads has 80 million people ; it is the largest population in the Arab world . \nAnd that 's put a strain on the government because many of the people feel it 's unable to meet their demands . \n20 percent of Egypt 's population lives below the poverty line . \nAnd one more point , here : the Muslim Brotherhood . \nThis is a group that 's been very vocal in encouraging people to protest . \nAnd it 's technically illegal ! \nEgypt 's constitution does not allow religion-based political parties . \nBut the Muslim Brotherhood has been somewhat tolerated by President Mubarak . \nI say `` somewhat '' because members are allowed to run in local elections , but they 're not allowed to have seats in the country 's government . \nNow , I 'm gonna turn it over to Don Lothian to show you why what happens in Egypt is so important to the United States , as well as countries near Egypt in the Middle East . \nDAN LOTHIAN , CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT : As tensions rise in Egypt , the White House is ramping up its response . \nU.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA : When President Mubarak addressed the Egyptian people , he pledged a better democracy and greater economic opportunity . \nI just spoke to him after his speech , and I told him he has a responsibility to give meaning to those words , to take concrete steps and actions that deliver on that promise . \nLOTHIAN : Secretary of State Hillary Clinton weighed in too , voicing concerns over the violence directed at protestors by police and security forces . \nU.S. SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY CLINTON : We urge the Egyptian authorities to allow peaceful protests and to reverse the unprecedented steps it has taken to cut off communications . \nLOTHIAN : The Obama administration has been pushing President Hosni Mubarak privately and publicly to implement reforms . \nA delicate dance as cables released by Wikileaks revealed . \nIn a 2009 dispatch over concerns about human rights abuses , U.S. Ambassador Margaret Scobey is reported to have written , `` Mubarak takes this issue personally and it makes him seethe when we raise it , particularly in public . '' \nU.S. officials have also resisted calling for regime change . \nJON ALTERMAN , CENTER FOR STRATEGIC AND INTERNATIONAL STUDIES : I think the administration is going to try to appeal to the best instincts , and ultimately will work with whoever is in power in Egypt . \nPROTESTERS : Hey Hey ! \nMubarak has to go ! \nLOTHIAN : Even so , outside the White House , pressure from protesters looking for change . \nEgypt has been a key U.S. ally for years , working to bring Israelis and Palestinians together , being a stable partner in the region , and supporting the international effort to reign in Iran 's nuclear ambitions . \nROBERT GIBBS , WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY : And that 's important , but there is a responsibility that is had by the government of Egypt , regardless of the role that they have played internationally or regionally , over the course of any number of years . \nThey also have to address the grievances that have built up for those same number of years within the country of Egypt . \nLOTHIAN : Officials here at the White House are also discussing the assistance that the U.S. gives to Egypt , including more than a billion dollars each year . \nThey 'll be reviewing over the next few days how the government deals with unrest on the ground and how that might impact that aid . \nDan Lothian , CNN , the White House . \nTOMEKA JONES , CNN STUDENT NEWS : Today 's Shoutout goes out to Mrs. Barnes ' and Mrs. Rumbarger 's STEM classes at Petal High School in Petal , Mississippi ! \nWhat U.S. government program provides money to retired workers ? \nIs it : A -RRB- HUD , B -RRB- Social Security , C -RRB- CDC or D -RRB- Peace Corps ? \nYou 've got three seconds -- GO ! \nThe Social Security program gives money to Americans who are retired , disabled or in need . \nThat 's your answer and that 's your Shoutout ! \nAZUZ : It was 71 years ago today that the first Social Security check was issued ! \nThe person who got it ? \nHer name was Ida Fuller ; she received a check from the government for $ 22.54 . \nDuring the two years before that , Fuller had paid money into the system . \nThat 's how Social Security was designed to work : People who are working pay money in ; people who are retired get money out . \nIf any of you have jobs , you 're part of this , too . \nThere 's a line on your paycheck for how much money is taken out for Social Security . \nBut there 's a lot of debate around Social Security and concerns that this fund might run out some day , and maybe in the not-too-distant future . \nPeople are living longer than they used to , so they 're getting more money from Social Security . \nAnd by the time people who are currently putting money into the system are old enough to take money out , there might not be anything left for them . \nAZUZ : Now personally , I write in cursive when I 'm taking notes , because that 's what I learned in school . \nBut I also know how to type , too , and I learned that as well . \nWhat we 're asking on today 's blog is : Do you think it 's important to preserve the old-school cursive , or should schools focus on skills you 'll need later in life , like typing ? \nYou know where to go to talk to us : CNNStudentNews.com ! \nAZUZ : And finally , we 're right on time for today 's Before We Go segment . \nIt may look like a normal cuckoo clock , until you realize that the cuckoo coming out 's a person ! \nThis thing actually is the world 's largest cuckoo clock . \nAt least , that 's what the creators were aiming for . \nThey unveiled this 66-foot tall , 28-foot wide clock this weekend . \nEvery hour , the bells brought out an actor who gave a performance . \nAZUZ : Some people may think it sounds a little ... you know . \nBut you 're welcome to chime in with your own thoughts . \nAnd we are just about out of time . \nToday 's sign-off line comes from Nick : He says anything unrelated to elephants is irrelephant . \nWhether it 's a pun or whether it 's just a creative goodbye , we 're gonna look forward to it , and we 'll see you right back here tomorrow when CNN Student News returns . \n"}

\nFor the people of Egypt , I wish for a non-violent revolution , ending in a shape of government to their liking . \nThe problem with modern democracy in many states around the world , is that to become a leader , you need money . \nA lot of money . \nObamas campaign costs added up to 750 million $ ... Where is the democracy in this ? \nHow can the working man compete with it ? \nModern democracy is a pyramid of money , which looks a lot like the medieval feudal system , and until we , the people say no , it will keep looking like this . \nPeace to Egypt an power to the people February 1st , 2011 6:29 am ET Guys , it is not about USA or the west is particular , it is about the freedom , liberty and accountability which seem that those things are not available in the Middle East . \nBut go back to Egypt where I came from Egyptians suffers for the last 60 years of corruption , dishonesty , suppression , manipulative media , lack of economic planning and dictatorship in each of those underqualified leaders and their regimes . \nThe Egyptian constitution becomes an ill piece of legislation which has no relation to the fundamentals of the word constitution !! After too many changes to suit Mubarak and before him , Saddat and before Saddat was Naser , Sorry , at Naser s time there was no Constitution !! He did not need one because he knew it all and that was the beginning of the dark days for Egyptians . \nTo John , I would like to say that ElBaradei is not a puppet to USA and he is an honest Egyptian , well educated and graduated from the law school in Cairo university and has a PhD in international law and I wish that he takes over an interim government until a proper Constitution get drafted to suit the people not the ruler !! What Egyptians need is responsible government to be accountable to its work and not a life time ruler . \nAbout the Moslim brotherhood , those people are not the as the media portraying them , it is just way of holding on power by indicating that if the Angle Mubarak goes the west will face the mighty extremists !! So the devil you know better than the devil you do not , and that is a naive approach from the west and I have to say that this is nonsense . \nFor the rest of the Middle Eastern countries I wish you wake up too . \nFortunately , in the `` world '' I live in , there is exposure to many information sources and media with every opinion under the sun . \nConsequently , one can develop one 's own ideas dismissing any attempt at manipulation and propaganda in the process . \nThose are the advantages of a democratic society with the institutions necessary to protect its citizens from descent into anarchy and chaos . \nFebruary 1st , 2011 11:18 am ET Sayed K , thanks for your post . \nYou say ElBaradei is not a puppet to USA . \nYou say he 's only going to form a unity government until free elections are possible . \nMy dear friend that s exactly what they said about Hamid Karzai in Afghanistan . \nElBaradei is a UN man . \nWhat good has the UN been for the middle east ? \nPlease understand the IMF ordered Egypt to cut food subsidies . \nThey new this would cause riots . \nAnd just after they cut the subsidies ElBaradei flew in from the west . \nMubarak has been a puppet for America , and he held you down with bullets made in the USA . \nBut he is old and needs to be replaced . \nSo in comes ElBaradei . \nThe Muslim brotherhood has been funded by Britains MI5 since 1926 . \nThe British and Americans want revolution to sweep the middle east . \nThey hope your countries can be divided into smaller blocks like North and South Sudan . \nThe want a new united Arab regime in Saudi and Egypt to fight Iran . \nThe Egyptians on the street were never calling for ElBaradei . \nMost Egyptians on the street have limited access to modern communications and know little of ElBaradei . \nAsk the people who they want , do accept what the TV tells you is the people choice . \nFebruary 1st , 2011 11:21 am ET Ask the people who they want , do NOT accept what the TV tells you is the people choice . \nIt is quite likely that most of the 80 million Egyptians are satisfied with the Mubarak regime and are disinterested in change and anarchy . \nUnfortunately , they are also vulnerable to conspiracy theories . \nWhat the media is not telling you ? \nInherent problems of the Arab world : - Dreaming to impose Islam worldwide by force - All the ME regimes and religious leaders brain washed peoples mind against external imaginary enemies - Investing in armies but not in future building - Increasing prices of basic food . \n- Inability to compete in the modern world No political movement calls to deal with the infrastructure issues ; Lessen to ME people and political declarations it is obvious that : The Arab masses want a solution to the unemployment and food problems regardless the regime type . \nFebruary 1st , 2011 5:40 pm ET It is interesting that according to many media and commentators above , all of a sudden , millions of people around the world now agree with Avigdor Lieberman . \nWill that send them running in the other direction ?! February 2nd , 2011 12:35 am ET Several aspects need to be considered by the US and any other government , as well as anybody expressing opinions or support to Egypt : 1 . \nIf you were in President Mubarak 's shoes , you would be scared . \nHe fears for his life and unless a safe exit is guaranteed for him , preferably by another country , he will have difficulty acknowledging that he needs to step down immediately , for the sake of his own people . \nThe world should not offer `` half-ass '' support and deals , as this will only breed resentment and lead to violence and a militant theocracy taking over . \nPresident Obama 's speech this evening is an example of such deal . \nThink : if you were an Egyptian putting your life on the line out in the streets , what impact would his message have on you ? \nEgyptian people need help handling the protests and the post-protest times . \nThey have not had the privilege of growing up in a free society and being privy to peaceful and collaborative tools of resolving conflict . \nWhat is going on with this world ??? what about pease ? \nFebruary 2nd , 2011 5:47 pm ET I plead all the European leaders and USA to force Mubarak to resign before the massacre among the protesters . \nFebruary 3rd , 2011 1:01 pm ET noo plz not by this way if Mubarak to resign now egypt will be destroyed the people who protesters now in ELTAHRER dont representing Egyptians I plead all the European leaders and USA to ASK EGYPTIONS OUTSIDE -LRB- ELTAHER -RRB- before take any decision How about this amazing policy statement from the Quran ? \n`` He will teach him the scripture , wisdom , the Torah , and certain prohibitions imposed upon you . \nI come to you with sufficient proof from your Lord . \nTherefore , you shall observe GOD , and obey me . \nO followers of the scripture , why do you argue about Abraham , when the Torah and the Gospel were not revealed until after him ? \nDo you not understand ? '' \nThat 's how we in the US can help democratize the entire Middle East . \nWonder how that would sound in Hebrew , Koine Greek , even Latin which were all political before the writing of the Quran . \nIs n't this the highest form of freedom of speech there is ? \ni am Egyptian . . \nand now i proud February 6th , 2011 5:47 am ET Those who start protesting in Tahrir square are the young generation . \nIt is true that many of opposition Parties try to ride the wave . \nBut , they will not succeed as they never represented the people . \nAs for the Muslim Brotherhood they are not welcomed by the people at all , even from religious Muslims . \nThere numbers are not as the west think . \nThey are not welcomed by anyone and will never take over Egypt . \nAs for Mubarak he is trying to gain back his power over the country . \nHe might succeed as the changes that he made are fake and all the new faces are in fact supporters to his regime . \nWe need really the changes we claim , but the result is not clear at all ! \nFebruary 8th , 2011 1:56 pm ET Learn , think and watch your steps ! \nThe free world is advised to learn the lesson of `` Tehran 1979 , '' when a pro-Western dictator , the Shah , was overthrown by an alliance of reformists and Islamists . \nShortly after the fall of the Shah , the Islamists smashed the reformists , establishing an anti-Western regime that sponsored anti liberal and democratic values using terrorism and radicalism throughout the world . \nThe demonstrations in Tunisia and Egypt undermined the foundations of much of Obama 's approach to the Middle East . \nObama administration Middle East policy is lead by the motto `` anything but Bush . '' \nIt castigates Bush for being unrealistic regarding the promotion of democracy in the Arab world . \nBush 's support for democratization led not to democracy but to the rise of Hamas Islamic terrorists - a branch of Muslim Brotherhood in Gaza . \nNow Obama is repeating Bush 's mistake in Egypt the leading strategic country in the Arab world . \nObama calls for the inclusion of `` non-secular '' groups in the new government . \nIslamists anti-Western values and democratic government is deeply ideological and is not related to any American policy . \nObama willingness to abandon USA allies and embrace the Islamists will harm the standing of USA allies and strengthen anti-Western Islamists across the region Comments are moderated by CNN , in accordance with the CNN Comment Policy , and may not appear on this blog until they have been reviewed and deemed appropriate for posting . \nAlso , due to the volume of comments we receive , not all comments will be posted . \nWelcome to the Inside the Middle East blog where CNN 's journalists post news , views and video from across the region . \nThis is also a place where you can start the discussion so please keep your comments coming . \nWe highlight not only current news stories but also anecdotes and issues that do n't always make the top of the headlines . \nInside the Middle East airs the first week of every month on the following days and times : \n"}

{"id": "183", "time": "2011-01-30", "text": "FAREED ZAKARIA , HOST : This is GPS , THE GLOBAL PUBLIC SQUARE . \nWelcome to all of you in the United States and around the world . \nI 'm Fareed Zakaria . \nWe are devoting the entire show to Egypt today . \nComing up in just minutes , we have an interview with Mohamed ElBaradei , the Egyptian opposition leader , Nobel laureate , who remains under house arrest . \nWe 'll check in with reporters from around the region for the latest . \nAnd we have a terrific panel of diplomats and scholars to put it all in context . \nPlus , an exclusive , the British Prime Minister David Cameron 's thoughts on the events in Egypt . \nNow , first , let me give you my take . \nEgypt is one of the oldest countries in the world . \nIt 's had roughly is same borders and capital city since 3,000 B.C. And it has always seen the embodiment of stability , a state ruled by pharaohs , with the bureaucracy that never budge . \nNow , Egypt is in the midst of enormous change . \nThis may not be a revolution in a sense of a massive social transformation , but it is a revolt . \nThe first Arab revolt was in 1916 against the Ottoman Empire that ruled most of the Arab lands . \nWhat is going on today in Tunisia and now Egypt is the second Arab revolt against the strong men who have ruled these lands for decades . \nTunisia was the spark that led the fire . \nTelevision and the Internet and social media amplified and accelerated the forces of change . \nBut in a strange sense , these forces might have been set in motion by the successes of the Tunisian and Egyptian regimes in recent years . \nYou see , Tunisia and Egypt had been reforming their economies . \nThis stimulated growth as a consequence . \nTunisia have been growing at 5 percent a year and Egypt much faster than that . \nEconomic growth stirs up expectations . \nIt is this revolution of rising expectations that often undoes a dictatorship , because it is unable to handle the growing demands of its citizens . \nIn Egypt , Hosni Mubarak 's regime had moved forward economically , but actually moved backward politically , rigging elections , jailing the opposition and signaling that the 82-year-old ailing dictator intended to stay in power for years . \nWhat should the United States do ? \nMany journalists and intellectuals are urging much stronger support for the movement on the streets and , obviously , we are all thrilled by the sight and sounds of the people on the streets of Cairo and Alexandria and all over Egypt demanding freedom . \nEveryone wants democracy and democracy in Egypt could be an earthquake in the Arab world . \nBut President Obama does have to balance his support for democracy with the reality that Egypt has been a partner with America for over 30 years . \nImagine the alternative -- that the first signs of street protests , the U.S. unceremoniously dumps a stalwart ally that has made peace with Israel , fought al-Qaeda , tried to moderate Hamas and brokered deals for the Palestinians . \nMy solution would be that President Obama clearly and firmly , but privately , tell President Mubarak that he must resign , perhaps not immediately , but soon . \nHis vice president must organize a new constitutional body to write a constitution for Egypt , with strong protections for individual rights , minority interests , freedom of the press , and then carefully set up a process for national elections . \nObama does not need to call publicly for Mubarak 's resignation , but he does need to get him to go . \nAmerica has been urging the Egyptian regime to reform for years , even decades . \nHosni Mubarak never took these calls seriously . \nHad he done so , had he come out in front of these changes , had he come out in front of his people , he could have avoided this revolt . \nBut that is the story of dictators . \nIt is often too little too late . \nZAKARIA : Mohamed ElBaradei is , perhaps after President Mubarak , the crucial figure in this story . \nAfter his leaving his post as head of the world 's nuclear watchdog , the International Atomic Energy Agency , he has devoted himself to agitating for change in Egypt , his home country . \nAnd how he is the most high-profile leader of the opposition movement in Egypt . \nHe was put under house arrest on Friday , but is able to join me now from his home in Cairo . \nThank you for joining us , Mohamed ElBaradei . \nMOHAMED ELBARADEI , FORMER IAEA DIRECTOR : It 's always a pleasure to be with you , Fareed . \nZAKARIA : Mohamed , what do you make of the most recent moves by President Mubarak , appointing Omar Suleiman as his vice president , appointing another former army officer as the prime minister , the former aviation minister . \nWhat is your reaction ? \nELBARADEI : Well , Fareed , I think this is hopeless , desperate attempts by Mubarak to stay in power . \nI think it is loud and clear from everybody in Egypt that Mubarak has to leave today , and it is non-negotiable for every Egyptian . \nPeople have been saying or demonstrating for his -- for him to leave . \nToday , the demonstrations say that he should be put to trial . \nIf he wants to save his skin , if he has an iota of patriotism , I would advise him to leave today and save the country . \nZAKARIA : And what would you like to see happen after that ? \nLet us say Mubarak resigns . \nWhat is the -- what are the next steps that must happen in Egypt ? \nELBARADEI : Well , the next step , Fareed , as everybody now agrees on , is a transitional period , a government of national salvation , of national unity , and that will prepare the ground for a new constitution , free and fair election . \nThese are the three basic demands , what every Egyptian is agreeing upon . \nAnd of course , you know , hoping that the army will be able to control the situation . \nRight now , Fareed , the country is ablaze . \nDisbanded police forces that were disbanded for -- nobody knows how they were disbanded -- are looting around the country . \nThe army is not able to control things . \nMillions are in the streets . \nThis is a country that 's falling apart , and the -- he needs to leave today . \nThat will hope help -LRB- ph -RRB- , at least 70 percent , to be followed by a smooth transition of a national unity government , to be followed by all the measures set in place for a free and fair election and democratic constitution . \nEgypt needs to catch up with the rest of the world . \nWe need to be free , democratic , and -- society where people have the right to live in freedom and dignity . \nThat 's what you get after 30 years , Fareed , of utter brutal dictatorship supported by everybody in the name of pseudo-stability . \nZAKARIA : You mention the army , Mohamed . \nTalk about that , because Omar Suleiman is himself a former -- a member of the armed forces . \nThe new prime minister is . \nThere is speculation that the army is backing these moves by Mubarak and has in effect taken control of the country . \nELBARADEI : Well , I do n't think that the army has taken control of the country , Fareed . \nIf you -- if you look around , there 's half million people everywhere , in the middle of Cairo , in the middle of Alexandria . \nOmar Suleiman is a person I know . \nI have respect for him . \nBut the army is -LRB- inaudible -RRB- not change of personalities . \nWe need a change of system . \nWe need to have substantive , drastic shifts from a dictatorship into a democracy , like the rest of the world . \nWhat I have been authorized , mandated by the people who organized these demonstrations and by many other parts of the Egyptians , to agree on a national unity government . \nAnd I hope that I would -- I should be in touch soon with the army , and we need to work together . \nThe army is part of Egypt , and we have the highest respect for them as civilians , and we need to work together to get Egypt -LRB- inaudible -RRB- . \nWhat do we have today ? \nA country that 's falling apart . \nZAKARIA : You say you are -- you hope to be in contact with the army . \nHave they reached out to you ? \nDo you intend to reach out to them ? \nELBARADEI : Not yet , Fareed . \nI mean , the whole situation has been moving very , very fast , and -- but today there has been a number of declarations by different parts of the Egyptian society , from right , left and center , mandating me to work in -- with them , with the army , with everybody in Egypt , with outside world , to ensure smooth transition . \nZAKARIA : You 've heard President Obama 's statements in which he says he has asked President Mubarak to act on his promise to change , to bring democracy to Egypt . \nDo you think -- do you want him to do more than that ? \nELBARADEI : Of course I do . \nI have , as you know , the utmost respect for President Obama as a person . \nI worked with him during my time at the IAEA . \nI have a lot of admiration for him . \nBut I can tell you , honestly , as a friend of the U.S. , that your policy right now is a failed policy , is a policy that is lagging behind , is a policy that is -- is -- having the effect here in Egypt that you are losing whatever left of credibility . \nAnd -- however , this is -- this has been -- will be overtaken by events , and I want you to be on top of things . \nYour policy right now -- and this is an honest advice , Fareed -- is absolutely has no credibility here in Egypt . \nThat is -- that is coming from a friend of the U.S. , somebody who lived in 15 years in the U.S. and worked for throughout my life in the U.S. I would like to see a democratic Egypt , continued -- a democratic Egypt that is able to have a friendly relationship with the U.S. . \nWe have always had a lot of common interests , and there is nothing to believe that a democracy here will not lead to a better relationship with the U.S. , based on respect and on equity . \nZAKARIA : Do you want President Obama to come out and publicly ask President Mubarak to resign ? \nELBARADEI : I -- I mean , obviously , that is going to happen , I think , Fareed , if not today , tomorrow , you know . \nIt will happen that he has to leave the country within the next three days . \nThat is -- there is no way out , as I see it . \nIt 's better for President Obama not to appear that he is -- he is the last one to say to President Mubarak , it 's time for you to go , leave in dignity before things are going out of hand . \nWe have seen the fate of many dictators . \nI do not want to see that happening in Egypt . \nZAKARIA : Mohamed , one of the visions that haunts Americans is of the Iranian revolution , where a dictator , pro-American dictator , was replaced by an even worse regime that was even more anti-American and more threatening to the region . \nPeople worry about the Muslim Brotherhood . \nAre you confident that a post-Mubarak Egypt will not give rise to some kind of Islamic fundamentalist force that will undermine the democracy of Egypt ? \nELBARADEI : I 'm quite confident of that , Fareed . \nThis is a myth that was sold by the Mubarak regime , that it 's either us , the ruthless dictators , or above -LRB- ph -RRB- them the al Qaida types . \nYou know , the Muslim Brotherhood has nothing to do with the Iranian model , has nothing to do with extremism , as we have seen it in Afghanistan and other places . \nThe Muslim Brotherhood is a religiously conservative group . \nThey are a minority in Egypt . \nThey are not a majority of the Egyptian people , but they have a lot of credibility because all the other liberal parties have been smothered for 30 years . \nThey are in favor of a federalist -LRB- ph -RRB- state . \nThey are in favor of a wording on the base of constitution that has red lines -LRB- ph -RRB- that every Egyptian has the same rights , same obligation , that the state in no way will be a state based on religion . \nAnd I have been reaching out to them . \nWe need to include them . \nThey are part of the Egyptian society , as much as the Marxist party here . \nI think this myth that has been perpetuated and sold by the regime has no -- has no iota of reality . \nAs you know , Fareed , I 've worked with Iranians , I 've worked here . \nThere is 100 percent difference between the two societies . \nZAKARIA : And finally , would you be willing to serve as a president , as an interim president , if Mubarak were to step down ? \nELBARADEI : I 'm willing to do whatever I can do to save this country , Fareed . \nYou know , this is not my priority . \nI have a lot of interests in global issues , as you know , humanity , inequity , arms control , and I continue to be active on all these issues . \nBut if my people here , the Egyptian people want me to serve as a bridge from authoritarian system into a democracy , I will not let them down . \nThat is -- I owe it to them here . \nZAKARIA : Mohamed ElBaradei , pleasure to have you on , and I hope we 'll have you on again soon . \nELBARADEI : Pleasure to talk to you , Fareed . \nZAKARIA : When we come back , the latest live from Alexandria and Cairo , in a moment . \nZAKARIA : The ancient city of Alexandria has seen some of the worst violence in the nation during this period of chaos . \nAt least 31 are said to have been killed there . \nAnd during the demonstration earlier today , anti-American anger was palpable . \nNic Robertson was at that demonstration and joins me now . \nNic , so far , America has not played a very large role in the street protest . \nWhat do you think changed ? \nAnd describe what you saw . \nNIC ROBERTSON , CNN SR. . \nINTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : I think the frustration level has gone up because the crowds are clearly not having their voices answered . \nPresident Mubarak stays in power . \nPeople are listening very , very attentively . \nAnd , remember , many of the people behind these demonstrations are young students , university students , young lawyers , as well as people from all walks of life , but they listen very attentively -LRB- AUDIO BREAK -RRB- President Obama has said . \nAnd the growing feeling here has been that President Obama has shaded his response too much sort of in the middle , if you will , siding perhaps with President Mubarak , and not enough coming out in support of the people . \nThis has n't been a central theme of the demonstrations until today . \nToday , it was . \nI really heard very loud and clear , and there were banners proclaiming it , that people feel that United States is a supporter of President Mubarak . \nThis plays , if you will , to American fears that they wo n't complete change , that they feel President Mubarak has been propping up policy in the region with respect to Israel , that wants to see a complete change from that , and that anger and frustration present in the demands for Hosni Mubarak , President Mubarak to step down is now being transferred and filtered to the very behemoth anger of the United States for not coming out more strongly in the favor of the people . \nWe 're also now hearing that people are opposed to United States policy in the region , particularly towards Israel -- Fareed . \nZAKARIA : Thank you , Nic . \nWe 'll have you back soon . \nComing up : a great panel to put this all in context . \nZAKARIA : Joining me from Cairo 's largest public square , Ivan Watson , where about 10,000 people are gathered despite it being after the curfew . \nIvan , what can you tell us ? \nIVAN WATSON , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Fareed , I 'm afraid I 'm having some audio problems and I 'm not hearing you right now . \nIf you can hear me all right , we 're in Cairo 's Tahrir Square . \nIt 's after 5:00 at night . \nThe sun is rapidly setting over the Egyptian capital . \nI 'm going to step out of the way . \nWe 're more than an hour after curfew and as you can see , thousands and thousands of people out here , and are showing their ongoing defiance to the government of President Hosni Mubarak . \nAnd this despite the fact that there was a show of force , two fighter planes flying so low over this square less than two hours ago , just at the start of curfew that I could actually see into their cockpits . \nDespite that , -LRB- AUDIO BREAK -RRB- and waving the real symbol of this movement so far , the Egyptian flag . \nThis has been a movement that has been wrapped up in patriotic pride for Egypt . \nPeople saying they want to stay after 30 years in their own government and who will lead their country and make -LRB- AUDIO BREAK -RRB- decades replaced . \nOne big question -- no one can tell me who they would like the next president to be -- Fareed . \nZAKARIA : Thanks , Ivan . \nWe 'll be back to you as well . \nSo , what was going on ? \nWhat is the end game ? \nAnd what role should the United States play in all of this ? \nThese are just some of the things I want to talk about with a great panel we have , all long time , Egypt hands . \nMartin Indyk spent his entire career as a U.S. diplomat in the Middle East , everything from assistant secretary of state for Middle Eastern affairs to U.S. ambassador to Israel . \nHe 's currently senior adviser to George Mitchell , the special envoy for the Middle East peace process . \nRichard Haass was senior director for policy planning of the State Department under George W. Bush and senior director for Middle Eastern affairs at the National Security Council under the elder Bush . \nHe is now the president of the Council on Foreign Relations . \nOn the scholarly side : two men who are both just back from Egypt . \nTarek Masoud is of Egyptian origin , is an assistant professor at Harvard 's Kennedy School of Government . \nAnd Steven Cook is a senior fellow at the Council of Foreign Relations , where he 's writing a book on Egypt . \nTarek , explain your -- you have family in Egypt . \nYou have many friends , you were just there . \nWhat is the looting about ? \nWhy is there looting taking place if these are protests against the government ? \nTAREK MASOUD , HARVARD UNIVERSITY : Well , it 's not the protesters doing the looting . \nIn fact , this , I think , indicates the quality of this regime because by all accounts that we 're hearing , these are thugs that the regime used to rely on to crack down people during elections . \nThey 've let them loose . \nThey 've opened up the prisons and allowed criminals to roam the streets , and then they pulled out the police and the security forces that are under the Ministry of the Interior . \nAnd this , I think , was to demonstrate to Egyptians , OK , if you want to protest this regime , look at the chaos that will follow . \nAnd their gamble is that the desire of normal middle class Egyptians for security and for stability will cause them perhaps to welcome a crackdown and a restoration of order . \nI do n't think it will work . \nZAKARIA : Richard Haass , what should the army do ? \nBecause this is the key institution in Israel . \nThe police widely hated . \nIf anyone can restore , you know , and the cycle Tarek is describing , it would be the army . \nWhat should they do ? \nRICHARD HAASS , COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS : You 're exactly right . \nThe army has to avoid looking tactless , which is what it 's looking like a little bit now . \nOn the other hand , it does n't want to use lethal force on behalf of Hosni Mubarak . \nWhat this tells you as quickly as possible , behind the scenes , and I emphasize that , behind the scenes , the army has to push for political change so then it can assert itself not on behalf of Mubarak , but on behalf of Egypt . \nThe army now , which really is in control politically , has to see that through and bring about a political change . \nZAKARIA : Steve Cook , you wrote a book about the Egyptian army . \nWhat is -- what do you think they 're going to do ? \nAre they -- would they be willing to actually take charge of the government ? \nOr do they really want to be behind the scenes ? \nSTEVE COOK , COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS : They want to be behind the scenes . \nAt one time , were in charge of the government and were burned by it in 1967 . \nWhat they want to do now is save the regime from which they benefit and they want to push Mubarak out slowly . \nThat 's why you see the handoff to Omar Suleiman , the intelligence chief , who is a military officer . \nZAKARIA : You met with him when you were in Egypt . \nDid you he have any clue about these protests ? \nCOOK : Well , we did ask him about the upcoming Police Day protests , and he insisted that Egypt was not like Tunisia , that , in fact , the police had a strategy and that President Mubarak was strong . \nHe turned out to be wrong on both accounts , which does n't inspire a lot of confidence going forward . \nZAKARIA : Martin Indyk , listening to all of this . \nDo you think that the United States is playing this right ? \nMARTIN INDYK , BROOKINGS INSTITUTE : Well , events are unfolding , Fareed , at a dizzying pace and the U.S. government is trying its best , I think , to keep up . \nBut I do n't think that they have yet made the transition in their own minds that essentially , the compact between Mubarak , the pharaoh , and his people has now be broken and therefore , as you -- you so far viewed it 's time for him to go and the focus should now be on transition . \nThey can not be seen to be pulling the rug out from under him . \nBut I think that they have got to start to put in place the basis for the very kind of constitutional process that you describe and that Mohamed ElBaradei embraced . \nZAKARIA : Richard , when we were talking earlier , you felt , though , that they were publicly be too critical of Mubarak . \nHAASS : All the calls for restraint seem to be siding a lot with the protesters . \nThe comment by the White House spokesman the other day threatening to review U.S. assistance to Egypt , that 's sending the message around the region . \nI just came back from Davos , as you did you . \nAnd a lot of people from elsewhere in the region were very concerned that this was raising questions about the reliability for the United States . \nIf they were that quick to distance themselves from a friend of three decades , what would that mean in Jordan ? \nWhat would that mean in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere ? \nSo , the administration , in a funny sort of way , I think needs to do less publicly and more privately . \nBecause the more it does publicly , and we 've seen , it will make nobody happy . \nWhatever they say will not be enough for the protesters and it will be too much for our friends throughout the region . \nI would put the emphasis on what the United States says and more important , does privately . \nZAKARIA : All right . \nWhen we come back , we will talk about what effect Egypt will have on the rest of the Middle East . \nWe have somebody from Beirut to talk to . \n-LRB- COMMERCIAL BREAK -RRB- \\* -LRB- COMMERCIAL BREAK -RRB- ZAKARIA : All right , and we are back with our panel of experts , Tarek Masoud from Harvard , Steven Cook from the Council on Foreign Relations , Richard Haass , the president of the council , and Martin Indyk , former U.S. diplomat , currently adviser to George Mitchell . \nTarek , you were disagreeing , I could see , with Richard Haass . \nRichard Haass says if we pull the rug from under Mubarak , it sends a signal to every regime in the Middle East , if you have street protests , United States is going to dump you . \nWhat do you say to that ? \nMASOUD : I think that 's not a bad signal to be sending . \nI think -- look , our policy for the last 50 years has be a policy that has favored stability over democracy , and that would be fine it if actually produced stability . \nBut I think what these protests have shown is that they do n't and that we ca n't keep these people in power , and we 're in a real risk if we follow Mr. Haass 's suggestion of going soft on Mubarak and not taking the side of the protesters . \nWe are in huge danger of being on the wrong side of history not just in Egypt , but in the rest of the Middle East , as well . \nZAKARIA : Martin , which side of history are you on ? \nINDYK : I agree completely with Tarek , although I think Richard 's on the right side , too . \nHe just wants to walk softly . \nThe basic point , as I said before , is the compact is broken . \nThis is over for Hosni Mubarak , and the question is now how to ensure , if possible , a stable transition to democratic government in Egypt . \nThat is a huge deal . \nIt will have huge ramifications for the whole region . \nNo doubt , every Arab autocrat is now shaking , and most of them are our friends . \nAnd obviously , we have to be concerned about the signal we send . \nWe have to be concerned about the Egypt-Israel peace treaty , as well . \nBut it does n't get resolved by clinging to a leader who no longer has any legitimacy with his people . \nAnd we can see that in these street scenes . \nSo we 've got to get on the side of history , and we need to do that quickly because it 's moving very quickly . \nZAKARIA : Steven Cook , do you dare disagree with your boss ? \nCOOK : What I would say is that there is n't really a lot that the United States can do . \nEgyptians are now writing their own history , their own narrative . \nIt started with Tunisia . \nIt 's now with Egypt . \nArabs throughout the region are now getting the message that the dictator can be dislodged . \nThat 's what Tunisia taught them . \nThere 's very little that we can do to shore up these regimes . \nThe region is changing . \nWe should be on the right side of history . \nWe should be saying strong things about the rights of people because we 're going to play this out for the next decade , 20 years . \nAnd Arabs will remember . \nYou saw Nic Robertson 's report from Alexandria . \nThe first week of this was not about the United States . \nBut central to the opposition to Mubarak is his alignment with the United States and the perception that he has warped Egyptian foreign policy and has done damage to Egypt 's regional standing . \nHAASS : First of all , our policy has produced stability for decades . \nWe would not have made the progress , among other things , between Israel and the Arabs that we did had we not supported some of these governments . \nSecond of all , behind the scenes , we should be pushing for change . \nPublicly , we should be very careful about what it is we -- what it is we say and what it is we do . \nIn many of these places , to go from where we are to quote , unquote , `` democracy '' sounds good . \nBringing it about will be extraordinarily difficult . \nIt 's one thing to say out with the old , something very , very different , to bring in the new and the new be better . \nWe have got to be very , very careful . \nThe time to make political change is very rarely when the crowds are in the street . \nIt 's the sort of thing history shows from other parts of the world , historically , over the last few centuries , you 're much wiser to push gradually for political change when things are calm . \nIf you wait until the people are in the streets , be careful . \nYou feed the beast . \nAnd it 's not clear that at the end of the day , you will set into motion a set of events you can control . \nThere are alternatives that are worse to Hosni Mubarak and the status quo . \nDoes n't mean you support him uncritically , but we 've got to be very mindful we can bring about things that are worse . \nZAKARIA : When we come back , we 're going to talk about the broader implications of all this , and we will go to Beirut . \nWe 'll be right back . \n-LRB- COMMERCIAL BREAK -RRB- ZAKARIA : What effect will Tunisia and now Egypt have on the rest of the Arab world ? \nMichael Young is one of the best reporters I know in the region . \nHe 's the opinion editor of `` The Daily Star '' in Beirut . \nHe joins me now . \nMichael , what is the answer to -- what do you think the repercussions of this are outside of Egypt ? \nMICHAEL YOUNG , `` THE DAILY STAR , '' LEBANON : Well , I think , at this point , we have to already -LRB- ph -RRB- see what the message is in Egypt , whether the army takes over or some other message . \nBut in terms of the Middle East , I think it 'll be very varied . \nThese are very different systems . \nI do n't really see , for example , the same thing happening a country like Syria or in Saudi Arabia . \nEven in Jordan , I think this may be difficult -- this kind of movement will not take place , I feel . \nAnd look at what happened in Lebanon in the last week . \nEssentially , in 2005 , the departure of -- the assassination of Hariri led to a Syrian withdrawal from Lebanon and a relative weakening of Hezbollah , at least politically . \nWell , in the past week , essentially , the Syrians have reimposed themselves in Lebanon and Hezbollah . \nSo I think it 's a -- it 's a very different image . \nI am a bit uncomfortable with these meta-narratives of the region going towards greater freedom . \nZAKARIA : Tarek Masoud , one thing that people are worried about -- I mentioned it in the interview with ElBaradei -- is the Muslim Brotherhood . \nThe idea here is this would be a replay of the Iranian revolution . \nYou 've studied the Muslim Brotherhood . \nWhat do you think -- do you think that they 're -- A , could they come to power ? \nB , if they come to power , is it an Islamic Egypt ? \nMASOUD : I think we 've long overestimated the Muslim Brotherhood , and I think in part , as Dr. ElBaradei said , this was because the regime wanted us to be fearful of the Brotherhood . \nIf we look at the protests now , if the protests are a kind of indication of the relative balance of political forces in that country , the Muslim Brotherhood are present . \nThey 're certainly participating in the protests . \nThey 're also organizing local defense groups . \nBut they 're not in the lead . \nNow , they 're the most organized political party . \nIt 's possible that in an election , particularly depending on the electoral system , that they do very well . \nBut I also think there are other forces in Egyptian society , and these protesters show that there 's a great demand for liberal politics . \nSo I do n't think that the Muslim Brothers would take over . \nOur worry is not so much the Iranian revolution as it is the Russian revolutions of 1917 . \nRemember , there were two , right ? \nSo in February , it was n't the Bolsheviks . \nIt 's only in October that the Bolsheviks take over . \nAnd that 's the worry that might happen here . \nBut I think the evidence is that the Brothers are very cautious . \nThey 've not tried to take the lead on this . \nAnd I think that 's because they ca n't . \nSo I do n't think we need to worry as much Mubarak would like us to . \nZAKARIA : Martin Indyk , do you think that we could live with a more democratic Egypt ? \nIt 's probably going to be more hostile to Israel . \nIt 's probably going to be more retrograde in certain social ways , you know , the veil and things like that . \nIt sort of , I guess , would look more like Turkey . \nOr could it be a lot worse ? \nINDYK : I think the key , Fareed , here is the role that the military plays . \nAs we 've already discussed and as Mohamed ElBaradei indicated , he 's looking to the military to restore order and essentially to hold the ring so that a democratic process can unfold , so that the risks that Richard Haass was talking about are minimized , and indeed , on the Turkish model , so that the Muslim Brotherhood is restrained . \nI 'm not quite as sanguine as Tarek about them , but I do think that if the military plays a democratizing role here , rather than sticking with Mubarak and going down with him , the situation may not devolve into the kind of chaos that we 're witnessing at the moment in the future . \nNow , the military has a strong reason for maintaining the peace agreement for Israel . \nIt serves its interests very well , including all of the aid it gets from the United States because it 's at peace with Israel . \nAnd so therefore , where the military goes will have a big impact on what the relationship is between Egypt and Israel in the future . \nCOOK : Fareed , let me get in on this -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- Let 's get to some facts about the military . \nWhen Gamal Abdel Nasser came to power in 1952 , they were going to return power to a clean parliamentary system . \nThis military is the descendant of that military . \nThey created this monster . \nWe should not be so confident that the military will return democracy . \nThey have their skin in the game . \nThey have become wealthy . \nThey have benefited from this regime . \nThey may be pushing Mubarak out just to reconstitute the regime in a different way under Omar Suleiman , under Ahmed Shafiq , under the chief of staff , Sami Enan . \nWe must look at the military not necessarily as a progressive force here . \nLike I said , this is the military 's regime , and it 's a monster that has created the archetype authoritarian system in the Middle East and has spun out transnational jihadism , as well . \nZAKARIA : We 're going to have to go . \nWhen we come back , David Cameron with his thoughts on the events in Egypt , and a bit more from our panel . \nZAKARIA : Some of you may have tuned in today expecting our exclusive interview with the prime minister of the U.K. , David Cameron . \nWe will play that interview in full next week . \nBut here is what he said to me on Friday in Davos , Switzerland , at the World Economic Forum , about Egypt . \nZAKARIA : You 've been watching the events in Egypt as a follow-on to what 's happened in Tunisia . \nDo you believe that Mohamed ElBaradei , the former director general of the IAEA who 's now become one of the leaders of the opposition movement , is correct when he says that President Mubarak should resign ? \nDAVID CAMERON , BRITISH PRIME MINISTER : Well , I think what we need is reform in Egypt . \nI mean , we support reform and progress in the greater strengthening of the democracy and civil rights and the rule of law . \nClearly , there are grievances that people have , and they need to be met and matched . \nI do n't think it 's right for us to point at a particular politician or a particular leader . \nI 'd like to see that progress take place . \nI do n't think it 's in anyone 's interest that people are being killed on the streets of Egypt as we speak at the moment . \nAnd so I hope the violence will cease . \nBut clearly , you know , when you have people that have grievances and problems , that want them responded to , it 's in all our interests that these countries have stronger rule of law , stronger rights , stronger democracy . \nBut the argument I would make is I think , in the past , sometimes we in the West have taken rather a simple view that what matters is just the act of holding an election . \nReal democracy is actually about the building blocks you put in place , about the rule of law , the rights , the strength of your civil society , the freedoms you have in that country . \nAnd I think we need to take a more mature and thoughtful approach to these countries and recognize it 's those building blocks that , in the end , make your country democratic , strong , accountable , all the things we believe in the West , rather than simply believing democracy is just the act of going to the polls . \nIt 's so much more than that . \nWe know that from our own history , as you do in America . \nAnd we need to apply that thinking to other countries , too . \nZAKARIA : When Hillary Clinton made some similar-sounding statements , ElBaradei -- again , who 's become a leader of the opposition -- said , You are effectively supporting 30 years of martial law and repression in Egypt . \nCAMERON : Well , I do n't believe that 's the case , as I said . \nWhat we support is evolution , reform -- not revolution , but evolution and reform so that people who have grievances get those grievances met . \nI think that the world would be a safer , stronger place , we 'd all be better off , if there were more countries with more democratic institutions . \nBut let 's recognize those institutions need to be built from the bottom up , not always sort dropped in from the top down , if I can put it that way . \nZAKARIA : Is Mubarak a friend of Britain ? \nCAMERON : He is a friend of Britain . \nBritain has good relations with Egypt . \nWe 've worked together over many issues that cause concern , not least the Middle East , where we want to see progress , not least the need to combat Islamic extremism . \nAnd as I say , in those countries , particularly those countries that have potential problems in terms of Islamic extremism , it seems to me the building blocks of democracy -- the rights , the rule of law , the independence of the judiciary , making sure the army plays a proper role in society -- those building blocks are even more important in countries prey to Islamic extremism , and in other countries . \nBut frankly , they 're essential to all countries , and it 's those building blocks that I think we should focus on . \nAnd in the relations we 've had with Egypt , we 've always made that point to Egypt 's leaders that believe in that sort of reform and progress and making sure that grievances are met and dealt with . \nZAKARIA : Richard Haass , you heard David Cameron . \nHe 's trying to do that balancing act that you were describing . \nHAASS : It 's a warning to countries where the degree of economic reform gets out of sync with the degree of political reform . \nAnd I expect in countries as far afield as China , they 're watching closely what 's going on . \nEconomic growth in China has far outpaced , if you will , political reform . \nTo the United States , the message is , you 've got to push for gradual political change , exactly as the prime minister said , all the basics , the difference between , if you will , democracy promotion and elections promotion . \nWe 've got to get that right . \nWe 've also got to keep all sorts of ties to militaries . \nIn many of these countries , like in Egypt , the military will probably play a central political role . \nIt makes a real case for continuing to educate these young military officers in American staff colleges because right now , the principal leverage the United States perhaps has over Egypt is privately what they can say to people like Omar Suleiman , the vice president , to get him to begin to move the country in the right direction . \nZAKARIA : Tarek , I 'm guessing David Cameron 's comments disappointed you . \nMASOUD : No , they do n't disappoint me , they 're just not surprising . \nI think , look , President Obama has a unique opportunity here . \nHe needs to get out in front of the Arab world and utter `` F '' word , freedom . \nAnd I think that will have a tremendous effect in reversing a whole legacy of bad policy towards this part of he world . \nNow is the time . \nThis is the game changer . \nZAKARIA : Quick last thoughts , Martin Indyk ? \nINDYK : Well , what you heard from David Cameron was yesterday 's language . \nThe talking points of reform and building blocks are all very fine , but Cairo is burning and the focus now is no longer Hosni Mubarak . \nHe is , in effect , a dead man walking . \nI think that the critical issues now relate to how can a constitutional process be put in place , if at all , to prevent chaos and anarchy and restore some semblance of order . \nI think the Egyptian people have an innate willingness for a stable process . \nThey 've had 3,000 years of obeisance centralized rule . \nBut it needs to be democratic rule . \nThat 's the 21st century Egypt that we have to help bring into being . \nZAKARIA : Final thoughts , Steven Cook ? \nCOOK : I think , broadly , in the region , the United States needs to use its diplomatic tools and political skills to accommodate itself to a changing region , rather than trying to change it or engineer transitions . \nThis is something that the Egyptian people are going to do . \nThis is something that the Tunisian people are going to do . \nWe can play a role at the margins , but ultimately , it 's going to be up to them and it 's going to vastly change the Middle East , perhaps for the better . \nZAKARIA : And finally , Michael Young from Beirut ? \nYour final thoughts on all of this ? \nYOUNG : Well I 've noticed that we 've not mentioned in this conversation Iraq . \nYou know , all this talk about gradual change -- well , the fact is , sometimes societies do n't have a chance to engage in gradual change , either because there are revolts or because there are invasions , as the case is in Iraq . \nI think today Iraq is a dysfunctional democracy . \nNo doubt about it . \nCameron is right when he says there is more to democracy than just elections . \nBut at the same time , I also think there is a genuine change , a genuine progress with respect to Saddam Hussein in Iraq . \nAnd I think it 's incumbent upon countries like the United States and the other democracies to help countries that have managed to put in some kind of a democratic system -- dysfunctional , sure -- but sometimes you say , Well , all right , gradual -- it 's over . \nWe ca n't go for gradual change now , so you know , let 's at least help these societies advance towards something more functional rather than dysfunctional . \nZAKARIA : Thank you so much . \nRichard Haass , Steven Cook , Tarek Masoud , Martin Indyk , Michael Young . \nAnd we will be back with Nic Robertson and more live from Egypt . \nZAKARIA : And we are back , and we 're going to Alexandria , Egypt , where Nic Robertson is joining us live . \nNic , one of the things that has come out in our discussion here is the key role of the army . \nFrom where you are , what do people on the street think the army is doing ? \nNIC ROBERTSON , CNN CORRESPONDENT : There 's a really mixed feeling about it , and a sense of confusion , as well . \nThey 're not sure if the army is here supporting President Mubarak -- the army is on the streets guarding government buildings in the city -- or if the army is actually here to support the people and provide security . \nAnd the impression they 're getting is that the army is not providing security in their neighborhoods , and therefore , the army is on the streets for President Mubarak . \nThe verdict 's out on it . \nThere have been very good relations between the people and army so far , but it 's really a very -- a source of serious concern for people when we talk to them which way the army will go , because they sense here that at some point , the army will be forced to make a decision by the dynamic of what happens on the ground . \nThey will be forced to make a decision . \nAre they with the people or the president ? \nWill they shoot on the people or will they not ? \nThat 's what worries them right now , Fareed . \nZAKARIA : And what about these vigilante groups that are forming ? \nAre they -- again , are they -- how should one read them ? \nROBERTSON : It 's a very random group , and really , depending on the neighborhood , that will depend on the group . \nin the sort of lower class neighborhoods , if you will , it 's a very sort of uneducated group of people that are providing this sort of vigilante lookout . \nBut we went to a secret location in the city here today . \nWe were taken there , not allowed to film on the way there , into an apartment building where young students and lawyers are planning up -- planning , dividing up the city , who should have -- form checkpoints on what corners , trying to put in place safety and security measures for the population , Fareed . \nZAKARIA : Thank you very much , Nic . \nAnd thank you to all of you for being a part of my program this week . \nI will see you next week , and we will then have the entire interview with British prime minister David Cameron on Egypt , but also on budgets and all kinds of other things . \n"}
{"id": "208", "time": "2011-01-30", "text": "Interview With Hillary Clinton ; Interviews With Senators McCain , Schumer Aired January 30 , 2011 - 09:00 ET THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT . \nCANDY CROWLEY , HOST : There is chaos and confusion in Egypt . \nState-run television is reporting at least 38 are dead following massive protests demanding the end of the 30-year rule of President Hosni Mubarak . \nWitnesses describe a scene that suggests anarchy . \nOne man said people are parading the streets , walking around with baseball bats and knifes . \nIt 's a situation that has enormous implications not just in Egypt , but in the entire Middle East and the U.S. CROWLEY -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Today , dissecting the crisis in Cairo with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton . \nCLINTON : We support the universal human rights of the Egyptian people , including the right to freedom of expression , of association , and of assembly . \nCROWLEY : Then , former U.N. ambassador and Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte , and former Ambassador to Egypt Edward Walker , and senior senators Republican John McCain and Democrat Chuck Schumer . \nI 'm Candy Crowley , and this is `` State of the Union . '' \nCROWLEY : The crisis in Egypt has left the Obama administration in a delicate position . \nJoining me from the State Department , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton . \nMadam Secretary , thank you for being here . \nCROWLEY : It seems to me that when this started out and we saw the signs and the protesters in the street , they were anti-Mubarak . \nNow , if you are watching , we are seeing signs that say `` U.S. , stop backing Mubarak . '' \nWhat side is the U.S. on , Mubarak or the people in the streets ? \nCLINTON : Well , there 's another choice . \nIt 's the Egyptian people . \nWe are on the side -- as we have been for more than 30 years -- of a democratic Egypt that provides both political and economic rights to its people , that respects the universal human rights of all Egyptians . \nAnd that is the message that every ambassador , whether Republican or Democratic president , everyone has conveyed for over 30 years . \nWhat happens is truly up to the Egyptian people . \nAnd what the United States is doing is sending a very clear message : We wish to see everyone refrain from violence . \nThe army is now fulfilling security responsibilities . \nThey 're a respected institution in Egyptian society . \nAnd we know they have a delicate line to walk , because they want to protect peaceful protests , but they also do n't want to see any city descend into chaos with looting and criminal activity . \nAnd we are encouraging a very -- a very careful approach that respects the rights of people . \nWe are also very much behind the kind of concrete steps that need to be taken for economic and political reform . \nWe have , over the past 30 years , supported civil society groups . \nWe have supported women 's groups . \nWe have tried to help build up a lot of the elements within Egyptian society that are going to be necessary when there is a national dialogue as we are urging to determine the path forward . \nAnd clearly , Candy , this is a complex , very difficult situation . \nEgypt has been a partner of the United States over the last 30 years , has been instrumental in keeping the peace in the Middle East between Egypt and Israel , which is a critical accomplishment that has meant so much to so many people . \nSo I think we have to keep on the message we 've been on , convey that publicly and privately as we are doing , and stand ready to help with the kind of transition that will lead to greater political and economic freedom . \nCROWLEY : The president 's remarks , in which he said much of what you just said , warning against huge crackdowns against peaceful protesters , saying we 've got to see some concrete steps towards opening up political reform and advancing it , it 's been interpreted here by many and some overseas as a beginning to back away from President Mubarak . \nDo you argue with that translation ? \nCLINTON : We -- we do not want to send any message about backing forward or backing back . \nWhat we 're trying to do is to help clear the air so that those who remain in power , starting with President Mubarak , with his new vice president , with the new prime minister , will begin a process of reaching out , of creating a dialogue that will bring in peaceful activists and representatives of civil society to , you know , plan a way forward that will meet the legitimate grievances of the Egyptian people . \nThere is a -- there 's no easy answer . \nAnd , clearly , increasing chaos or even violence in the streets , prison breaks , which we 've had reports about , that is not the way to go . \nWe want to see this peaceful uprising on the part of the Egyptian people to demand their rights , to be responded to in a very clear , unambiguous way by the government and then a process of national dialogue that will lead to the changes that the Egyptian people seek and that they deserve . \nNow , that will take time . \nIt is unlikely to be done overnight without very grave consequences for everyone involved . \nSo what we want to see is , as we 've said over and over again , the concrete steps taken . \nYou know , it took 30 years to have a vice president appointed . \nWe want to see both the existing and any new members of any government continue to put real life into what President Mubarak himself said , which were concrete steps toward democratic and economic reform . \nCROWLEY : If I could , the people that we 're seeing and certainly that you 're seeing do n't seem like the type that want to wait another 30 years for full democracy . \nCLINTON : Oh , of course not . \nCROWLEY : So when -- when we look at these demonstrations , when we talk to some of the people involved in it , it does not seem that even if President Mubarak were to do everything you have now laid out that he is at all acceptable . \nDo you think that President Mubarak can survive this ? \nCLINTON : You know , again , Candy , this is going to be up to the Egyptian people . \nBut let 's look at what we have . \nWe have a calendar that already has elections for the next president scheduled , so there is an action-enforcing event that is already on the calendar . \nCan there be efforts made to really respond to the political desires of the people so that such an election is free and fair and credible ? \nThere are many steps that can be taken by reaching out to those who have advocated a peaceful , orderly transition to greater democracy where the Egyptian people themselves get to express their views . \nThat 's what we wish to see . \nCROWLEY : But from what you 've seen -- from what you 've seen , will that be enough ? \nIf he takes those steps and says , `` Hey , we 've already got prescheduled elections coming up , '' is that enough to keep him in power ? \nCLINTON : Well , no. . \nMuch has to be done . \nAnd we 're not advocating -- we 're not advocating any specific outcome . \nWe are advocating that the government , the representatives of the civil society , the political opposition and activists begin a dialogue to chart a course . \nEgypt is a large , complex , very important country . \nI do n't think the Egyptian people want to see what is a very clear effort to obtain political and economic rights turn into any kind of new form of oppression or suppression or violence or letting loose criminal elements . \nThat 's not what they 're in the streets protesting for . \nSo how do we get from where they are today to where they would like to be ? \nIt needs to be done immediately with a process that brings people to the table and that the Egyptian people can see , `` Oh , I know so-and-so . \nHe represents a group that has been advocating for democracy for many years . '' \nThis is going to be a legitimate effort that is going to result in changes that will have responded to the needs and the voices of the people who have been protesting . \nCROWLEY : Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , a busy woman these days . \nWe thank you for your time . \nCROWLEY : Coming up , two former State Department officials on how the U.S. should respond to the ongoing crisis in Egypt . \nCROWLEY : When it comes to international policy , you deal with the foreign leaders you have , not the ones you might want . \nWhat the U.S. has in Egypt 's Hosni Mubarak is an invaluable , imperfect ally , the kind of repressive authoritarian Americans typically chide . \nGEORGE W. BUSH , PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES : America 's belief in human dignity will guide our policies , yet rights must be more than the grudging concessions of dictators . \nCROWLEY : One of the most recent prodemocracy speeches from a U.S. president came in mid 2009 in the heart of Cairo . \nA pointed bit of geography , but no names mentioned . \nOBAMA : You must maintain your power through consent , not coercion . \nYou must respect the rights of minorities and participate with a spirit of tolerance and compromise . \nCROWLEY : Yet , Mubarak , head of a secular government , has been a reliable ally , a conduit for the U.S. to other Arab nations . \nHe has maintained a cold peace with Israel , been helpful in the war on terror and opposed Iran 's nuclear program . \nCables recently part of the WikiLeaks release showed what sticky business diplomacy can be when a country 's interests run afoul of its values . \nU.S. Ambassador Margaret Scobey warned Secretary of State Clinton not to be too confrontational on the issue of human rights . \nMubarak takes this issue personally , she wrote , and it makes him seethe when we raise it , particularly the issue in public . \nWe will talk about the limits of U.S. influence and what a fallen Mubarak would mean for the region and the U.S. Ambassador 's Negroponte and Walker are next . \n-LRB- COMMERCIAL BREAK -RRB- CROWLEY : Joining me now here in Washington , Edward Walker , former U.S. ambassador to Egypt during the Clinton administration and John Negroponte , former U.S. ambassador to the U.N. under President George W. Bush . \nGentlemen , thank you both for bringing your expertise to the table . \nLet me ask you -- since you are no longer in office and can move international diplomacy with a single word , as obviously the secretary can , is the Mubarak era coming to a close ? \nWALKER : I firmly believe it . \nI think if you listen to the street , they are not asking for democracy , they are not asking for anything except the removal of Mubarak . \nHe 's become a symbol for everything that they find objectionable . \nIt does n't mean it ca n't be a transition as orderly and I certainly hope it is . \nBut he is a symbol now and you 've got to change the symbol . \nCROWLEY : Do you agree ? \nNEGROPONTE : I agree . \nBut I think it 's about how that era comes to a close . \nI think it 's all about the nature of the transition and how that 's arranged . \nCROWLEY : So now a Vice President Suleiman . \nBoth of you know him . \nIs this a good -- we were just talking earlier . \nIt just does n't seem to me that he will be acceptable to the street protesters either . \nNEGROPONTE : I think what the secretary said was important : that this is something for the Egyptians to decide . \nBut one of the questions you 'd have to look at is this the first step or the last step ? \nAnd it seems to me what the secretary was encouraging is that civil society in Egypt sit down with the president and the government and talk about the ways in which to organize the transition . \nWhat 's the nature of the upcoming presidential election going to be ? \nWho is going to be allowed to run ? \nWill international observation be permitted ? \nIt seems to me those are the kinds of issues that have to get on the table . \nCROWLEY : And when you look at this , I think what the unspoken fear of Americans is , if suddenly there should be a departure of Mubarak , for 30 years he 's run this country . \nThere is no real secular power that has been allowed to rise up to kind of be against him . \nSo it seems to me what you have is the Muslim Brotherhood and the army . \nAnd so they would fill any vacuum . \nAnd is n't that -- either one of those a not comfortable prospect for the U.S. ? \nWALKER : Candy , you also have an enormous bureaucracy that has been built up over the years that hags a stabilizing factor -- sometimes too stabilizing . \nIt has n't helped with reform . \nBut it 's hard to move Egypt into a violent kind of opposition . \nAnd I certainly do not think the Muslim Brotherhood has the wherewithal or the leadership to do it . \nThey do n't have charismatic leaders in the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood . \nThey do n't have a Nasrallah , they do n't have Ayatollah Khomeini . \nSo I -- yes , they will be a part of the political landscape , but they will not be a dominant part . \nCROWLEY : Do you agree with that ? \nI mean , what do you see -- how does this shake down ? \nNEGROPONTE : Well , I mean , one of the most bedeviling aspects of foreign policy and politics per se especially in an authoritarian environment is how , does one arrange for a peaceful and constructive transition to whatever it is that follows ? \nWe have a lot of examples of the disasters that have followed after the demise of an authoritarian leader , not that many good examples of constructive outcomes . \nSo , we all need to think very carefully about that as we look at this question . \nCROWLEY : Certainly not for the U.S. . \nYou know , in Iran and the Philippines , the Philippines sort of roughly turned out okay . \nNEGROPONTE : Well , I was ambassador to the Philippines subsequent to that . \nI mean , I would rate it as a success . \nPeople power , minimum of violence and today have a democratic government . \nBut Iran , of course , is a very bad outcome . \nCROWLEY : Went the other way . \nI wanted to show you a poll that Pew recently put out . \nIt 's on global attitudes . \nCROWLEY : And this was in Egypt . \nAnd the question was , do you have a favorable or an unfavorable view of the U.S. ? \nFavorable , 17 percent , Unfavorable , 82 percent . \nCan we expect anything other than kind of a troublesome era because no matter what else he was -- and I said in the little thing we did before this , you know , you deal with the foreign leader you have , not the one you would like to have . \nWe have dealt with Mubarak . \nHe has been a very strong ally . \nHe has helped in the war on terror , helped in a number of things . \nWith him going and this sort of attitude , the U.S. is in for a rough go now . \nWe are losing our closest Arab ally , are we not ? \nWALKER : Not necessarily . \nWhat 's important to us is Egypt , it 's not Mubarak . \nAnd Mubarak is not Egypt . \nCROWLEY : But Egypt does n't seem to care for us . \nWALKER : Egypt does n't care for us for a whole host of reasons , but it has to do primarily with the Palestinian issue . \nIt has to do with the fact that we have talked about democracy and yet we do n't seem to be supporting it . \nAnd they have been disappointed . \nThey look to us for leadership . \nAnd so the people of Egypt want the United States to be powerful but do n't feel it has been . \nCROWLEY : What about Israel ? \nLet 's bring Israel into the mix , which we ca n't ignore here , I mean ... NEGROPONTE : It is a critically important country in the Middle East peace process , has been for 30 years , a stalwart ally on that subject , one of only two Arab countries that has relations with Israel . \nAnd I guess the way to put the question seems to me would be imagine Egypt -- Egypt 's government in the hands of a government hostile to the United States ' interests in the Middle East . \nThat would be a very , very negative situation . \nCROWLEY : And I guess what I 'm asking is , what are the chances that might happen ? \nIt seems to me , if not hostile , certainly not as open to the U.S. as Mubarak has been . \nWALKER : Well , I think that the street opinion insofar as it 's going to have an impact or any kind democracy , is certainly not going to be as favorable to Israel as we would like to see it . \nPart of that reasoning is the way Israel reacts . \nIt 's up to Israel actually to make its case for a good relationship with Egypt . \nIt 's not really up to us to do that . \nCROWLEY : I 've heard a lot of people say in the past couple of days , I really do feel as though this is Iran all over again , where we , you know , did n't say , look , you have got to tamp this down and then we got the government we now have in Iran , which is seen as a security threat to the U.S. Are there parallels here or is that an overreach ? \nWALKER : I 'm convinced it 's a way overreach , because you had an extraordinarily dynamic situation in Iran . \nYou had a very , very repressive , torturing , all kinds of things , which everybody knew about . \nYou had a very charismatic leader who was in France who brought -- came back and just took charge , and took the country by storm . \nWhere is the parallel ? \nThere is no parallel . \nCROWLEY : Do you see it ? \nNEGROPONTE : Well , there are some disturbing analogies in the sense that if this goes wrong it could be very bad for our interests and also for the people of Egypt . \nBut I think the one cautionary note here is I do n't think we should be in that big of a hurry for the regime to change . \nI think what we need to ... CROWLEY : And the secretary did n't sound like we were . \nI think what we need to focus on is the path forward and that it be constructive and that it be responsive to people 's needs . \nBut it does n't have to be tomorrow , it just has to -- a path has to emerge as quickly as possible . \nCROWLEY : And yet , when I look at those streets , you think , boy , it kind of does have to be tomorrow . \nI mean , it seems to be a very impatient -- I mean , it seems to have burst . \nWALKER : Yes , it has . \nI do n't think we can control the pace . \nThat 's one of the real problems . \nIf we could control it , I would agree 100 percent that , you know , let 's take it step by step , do it in an orderly fashion . \nYou look at the street out there , and you look at where the military is and what it 's not doing , and you wonder , do we have that kind of time ? \nNEGROPONTE : Well , but I think it 's the role of governance to try and introduce a measure of moderation into these kinds of situations . \nThe street is not the government . \nThe street is not democracy . \nLet 's not forget that . \nCROWLEY : But they do n't seem to be listening to Mubarak at this point , I guess . \nAnd he seems to be the one at least somewhat in charge still . \nWALKER : I think the important thing is that the army still has respect and the street has respect of the people . \nIt is the right move to have brought the army in and to take the blackshirts out . \nAnd I think they have an opportunity now to move forward , but I think you 've still got that symbolic problem of Mubarak himself . \nCROWLEY : Let me ask you as a final question , what is your worst - case scenario ? \nWALKER : My worst-case scenario is that this thing drags on , it gets to be some real leadership of the opposition , the Muslim Brotherhood comes together , they find some charismatic leaders , and the next thing we know we have got an Islamist government . \nCROWLEY : Is that your -- would you ... NEGROPONTE : Well , either that , or through a process of oppression and control that the president simply carried on as before , presented himself for election again in 2012 . \nThat 's another -- that 's the other extreme . \nWALKER : Ah yes , the other extreme . \nCROWLEY : John Negroponte , Ed Walker , thank you both so much for joining us . \nCROWLEY : Up next , we 'll talk to CNN 's Fareed Zakaria , who just interviewed Egyptian opposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei CROWLEY : Joining me now from our New York bureau , Fareed Zakaria , host of CNN 's `` FAREED ZAKARIA : GPS . '' \nFareed , I know you just got off the phone with Mohamed ElBaradei . \nTell us what he had to say . \nHe 's just newly back to Egypt at this point . \nFAREED ZAKARIA , HOST , `` FAREED ZAKARIA : GPS '' : He 's back . \nHe seems to have emerged as the kind of leader of the opposition . \nIt 's tough to tell exactly why . \nProbably because he 's so high profile , former Nobel Peace Prize winner , that it would be very difficult for the regime to do anything to him . \nHe 's being very tough . \nHe 's sticking by his guns and saying Mubarak has to resign . \nIn fact , he said to me , he has to leave the country within three days . \nCROWLEY : So did he give you any hint about whether he -- what he sees would fill that vacuum ? \nBecause I think that 's what -- I think a lot of people think Mubarak has to go at some point if not within that particular time frame . \nZAKARIA : He did lay it out . \nHe imagines a one-year transition during which he said he would be happy to serve as the interim president , during which Egypt would write a new constitution and plan for national elections . \nSo he is not calling for something drastic and , you know , for it to happen tomorrow , but for a process to begin that would turn Egypt into a democracy . \nCROWLEY : Now , he sort of came in -- I mean , this revolution , these huge protests started before he got back into the country . \nSo he 's sort of riding on it . \nIs there reason to believe that he would be an acceptable person in that interim ? \nZAKARIA : I think it 's a good question . \nMy guess is that he would not be the choice of the Egyptian people in a national elections just because he is an international bureaucrat . \nZAKARIA : He 's not really a politician . \nBut it is conceivable that he would be somebody that all the parties would agree on as an interim president simply because he 's respected , he is a man of high integrity and in a sense , each one is going to want his own person . \nAnd the one thing they can agree on is that he would n't be a threat to them politically , particularly if he were to agree not to run in any further election . \nIn other words , if this were to be a temporary caretaker type position . \nCROWLEY : Fareed Zakaria , thank you so much . \nWe will look forward to that interview and everything else in the next hour . \nFareed will have more on the crisis in Egypt at the top of the hour on Fareed Zakaria , GPS . \nWe want to get an update on the latest developments in Cairo now with CNN 's Frederik Pleitgen . \nFred , just give us a sense of what 's going on now . \nFREDERIK PLEITGEN , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : Hi , Candy . \nWell , just a couple minutes ago a curfew went into effect in Cairo , so some of the people close to our building have left the street . \nHowever , there still appear to be 10,000 people in Tahrir Square which is around the corner here . \nAnd we are getting information from our cameraman Joe Durran -LRB- ph -RRB- that there 's been some interaction there . \nA helicopter is going overhead . \nThere 's been interaction there between the military and protesters where a man attempted to run an army barricade and was then shot overhead . \nYou see the helicopter overhead right there , landing right behind me . \nThat 's what 's so loud . \nSo there appears to be some interaction between the protesters and the military there , although so far what we have seen between the protesters and the military have been almost cheerful scenes between them . \nAnd I was actually on the scene in one place where the military and regular people were working together to try and keep their neighborhoods safe -- Candy . \nCROWLEY : So let me ask you first was that Egyptian army helicopter and are they patrolling the city from overhead ? \nAnd , b , do you sense that there 's been a lessening of tensions from , say , when this started to now ? \nPLEITGEN : Well , the tensions are different . \nFirst of all , yeah , I think it is an Egyptian army helicopter . \nThere have been Egyptian army helicopters flying overhead here for the better part of the day . \nThey actually also just a couple minutes ago had two F-16s from the Egyptian air force flying overhead . \nThe tensions are different now Candy than they were before . \nBeforehand we had a lot of police forces on the street that were really something of a lightning rod between them and the protesters and what was going on was that there was a lot of rioting on the streets . \nNow the military is here . \nIt appears as though the situation between the military and that protesters are much better , they seem to get along well . \nHowever , because there is no more police force within basically all of Cairo there is a lot of lawlessness . \nI was on the scene just a couple of minutes ago of a prison break just outside of Cairo where inside the prison there was still a shootout going and many people told me that the prisoners had escaped from that prison with weapons . \nAnd there simply are no police officers . \nWe also went by about six or seven police stations which had all been abandoned , which were all looted and all torched . \nAnd so you look here , you go into the night which is about to fall here in Cairo , people are actually banding together , and creating vigilante militias to try and protect what they have -- Candy . \nCROWLEY : Fred Pleitgen has been on the ground for us in Egypt . \nThank you so much . \nWe will be back to you . \nUp next , we 'll get reaction from the Senate 's ranking member on the armed services committee , Republican John McCain . \nCROWLEY : Joining me now in Washington , Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona . \nWe are at the point in foreign policy where our values are just running headlong into our strategic interests . \nI asked Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , who do we back ? \nDo we back Mubarak or do we back the people on the street . \nShe said , well , we back the Egyptian people which was a little different to her from the people on the street . \nIs it time to cut him loose ? \nMCCAIN : Not cut him loose , but also I think one of the lessons here is that we need to be on the right side of history in these countries and we need to do a better job of emphasizing and arguing strenuously for human rights . \nI understand how important -- and I hope we all understand how important Egypt is as an ally , as a center of culture . \nAnd one out of every four Arabs in the Middle East live in Egypt and how important they are . \nBut it was clear for a long time that the kind of repressive regime sooner or -- that Mubarak controls , sooner or later there is going to be great difficulties . \nGood news I think is that the army is playing a very constructive role . \nSo I think what we need to do now is to lay out a plan for Mubarak to lift the state of emergency , announce that elections -- free and fair -- will be held in September , which were already planned , allow an open and free democratic process , which I think we could have some confidence if it was an open process that you would see a free and fair election and that we make sure that the aspirations of the Egyptian people are realized finally . \nAnd it 's fraught with danger , as you earlier guessed : the Muslim Brotherhood , the Iranian example and others , but there is also a good chance for a real functioning democracy and arguably the most important nation in the middle east . \nCROWLEY : But , you know , for 30 years Republican and Democratic presidents have publicly at times , most privately as we saw in some of those leaked WikiLeak cables from the diplomatic cables , they said , you have to do something here , you ca n't be an authoritarian . \nIt did n't work . \nIt was 30 years of -- I mean , he 'd do something and we 'd say , okay , thanks and then we 'd sort of retreat . \nSo what else could have been done ? \nIs n't he too important to us ? \nMCCAIN : Madeleine Albright and I sent a letter before the last election saying allow observers in . \nRuss Feingold and I sponsored a resolution calling for more respected human rights . \nYou ca n't -- you can not over -- is n't it a lesson of history you can not have autocratic , regimes last forever . \nAnd the longer they last , the more explosive the results . \nAnd that 's a lesson we have to learn that all of these rights that individuals have is not confined to the United States of America and our allies . \nAnd so I still think we have a real opportunity to see a democratic transition . \nAnd by the way , could I also mention , Jordan is a very serious situation . \nYemen is a country that 's fraught with more problems than we can take the time to describe on this program . \nEven as far away as Libya . \nSo this is a very critical time . \nMCCAIN : What happens in Egypt will directly and dramatically effect what happens in these other countries . \nThere is a real awakening going on . \nCROWLEY : And -- but we are talking about other U.S. allies in the area who we have joined forces with and they are not exactly democracies -- Jordan , Saudi Arabia , places like that . \nI mean , on Capitol Hill you all have the ability to cut aid to these countries , but Egypt is number two in foreign aid after Israel . \nAnd I think that we have to say that everything is on the table and encourage and help and assist , you know , a process that leads to a free and fair election . \nI have confidence in the Egyptian people that they are not going to elect an extremist . \nThey are not going to allow an extremist group to hijack their country and that can be prevented if we have a fair , open process beginning now between now and September , you could have the rise of political parties . \nYou could have a real democratic process that could be celebrated throughout the region and a model for the rest of the region . \nThe other is , of course is hang on , more demonstrations . \nThe army turns one way -- there is all kinds of bad scenarios here and really only one good one . \nBut I would say I think the president 's statement was correct . \nNow we need to take it a step further and we 've got to be on the right side of history here . \nCROWLEY : I guess the problem is that if we have been at them for 30 years to change , I wonder why they would listen to us now -- why Mubarak would listen to us now ? \nMCCAIN : Well , obviously he 's in an extremist position . \nThe army is now the critical institution . \nThe police , as we all know , have disappeared . \nIt 's the only real stabilizing force in the country right now . \nFortunately , we have had close relations with the Egyptian military . \nThere are a lot of very good , strong people there . \nSo -- and also I think that President Mubarak , he knows what 's going on in his own country . \nIt 's up to the United States to be a helpful , assisting but insisting partner . \nAnd by the way , we can not afford a Tiananmen Square in Cairo . \nCROWLEY : And that 's the question , I guess . \nWhen you look at these streets throughout Egypt , not just in Cairo , do you see a group willing to wait until September to get rid of Hosni Mubarak ? \nMCCAIN : I think that the group -- and I do n't know the sentiment on the street , but it seems to me logic if Mubarak said , I 'm not going to run again . \nI am turning over this government to a caretaker that you can trust probably with the army involved , they are not going to have any further political aspirations and we 'll set up a process for a free , open , transparent election in September . \nI think you could do that . \nBut this is a narrow window of opportunity . \nThe longer the unrest exists , the more likely it is to become extreme . \nCROWLEY : Tell me how you think the president has done so far . \nSounds like you think he 's done pretty well . \nAnd what do you want him to do next ? \nMCCAIN : I think the president should get a little bit more out ahead . \nI think his statement that he made day before yesterday was good . \nMCCAIN : Well , I think in other words lay out a scenario of what we think the Egyptian people should have every right to expect , the kind that I just described . \nThe past performance of this administration has n't been great . \nThey cut off some of the money for democratization , et cetera . \nBut we can review that at a later time . \nThe important thing is I think the president made the right statement . \nI think that the secretary of state made a good presentation to you . \nI just want to see her go a little bit further . \nAnd let 's get out in front on this issue on behalf of the things we have always stood for and believed in . \nAnd every time we have been on the right side of history it 's usually turned out okay . \nCROWLEY : What is your -- I asked Negroponte and Walker before you , what do you fear the most watching this ? \nBecause there is so much uncertainty right now that we really do n't know which way it 's going to go . \nMCCAIN : My great fear is , obviously , a radical Islamic extremist -- the Iran scenario versus the Philippines or other scenario . \nThat 's all of our greatest fear , but the longer this unrest , the more likely the radicals see openings to take power -- the Lenin scenario . \nSo that 's my greatest fear . \nMy second greatest fear , of course , started in Tunisia . \nEgypt , we see problems in Yemen ; Jordan , our dearest , most important -- very important ally . \nThis could be a really seminal moment in history of the Middle East . \nAnd the question is , is does that turn out good or does it turn out to the advantage of radical Islamic extremism ? \nAnd I do n't know the answer yet . \nCROWLEY : I do n't know either ... MCCAIN : Egypt will be key though . \nCROWLEY : We will have you back when the answers become clearer . \nThank you very much . \nUp next , we want to speak to Senator McCain 's Democratic colleague , Senator Chuck Schumer of New York . \nCROWLEY : Joining me now from our New York bureau , Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer . \nThank you for being here . \nObviously the story of the day and what 's going on in Egypt . \nLet me get your take now on really what now seems to be the key question : can President Mubarak survive this long enough for there to be some sort of transition to something else ? \nSCHUMER : Well , that is -- the hope is that there will be a transition to something else . \nI agree with the thrust of Senator McCain which is quite the same as the thrust of the president . \nThe bottom line is this , there are some good signs here . \nIt 's not all terrible . \nThe fact that the army is in control , the army is a respected institution in Egypt . \nThe people like it . \nYou can see even in the pictures the army and the protesters joining together to protect neighborhoods . \nAnd thus far most , not all , but most of the protesters have been focused on economic and political freedoms . \nIt is not an anti-U.S. message primarily nor is it a fundamentalist , radical Islamist message but a secular message . \nWe want economic and political freedom . \nIf the energy can be channeled constructively into free and open elections in September where there is some time for some secular opposition parties to germinate , that 's probably the ideal outcome . \nIt 's hardly a certainty , but it 's certainly a real possibility . \nCROWLEY : Well , Senator , I -- I agree with you that , when we first started this earlier this week , it was very definitely an anti- Mubarak protest across the country . \nBut we 've been noticing in the past couple of days that we are seeing more signs directed at the U.S. . \nOne of those , just recently , in the past hour or so , caught our attention and I wanted to show it to you , a young man holding up the sign that says , `` USA , we hate your hypocrisy . '' \nMy larger question to that is , is n't there a real chance here that the U.S. 's strongest ally , next to Israel , of course , or after Israel , in that region is Egypt , and we may be about to lose that ? \nSCHUMER : Well , that 's a real worry . \nAnd there are no really excellent solutions here . \nThe best solution would be channeling legitimate protests and hurts of the people , both economic and democratic , into a democratic election . \nAnd if that can happen , there 's a chance , as Senator McCain said , for a decent outcome , maybe even a model for the rest of the Middle East . \nThere is some anti-Americanism in the protests , but by and large , they still are basically , you know , a college student -- a college graduate who has n't been able to get a job for five years . \nThat 's what the people really want changed . \nAnd we believe , as we always have , that democratic government is the way to go . \nAnd hopefully , it can be channeled in that direction with the Army , sort of , as a guiding hand . \nCROWLEY : Last question on this , because I do want to turn you to some domestic questions . \nBut this has the potential of rocking the peace process . \nAnd I wonder what you think the threat to Israel is now -- not -- I do n't mean physical threat , but the threat to peace and stability in the region as a result of what 's going on right now . \nSCHUMER : Well , Egypt , by and large , has been a stabilizing force , obviously , recognizing Israel 's right to exist . \nEven after the assassination of Sadat , that continued . \nAnd so it is a very stabilizing force . \nMy hope is that Egyptian politics , which has tended to be secular , certainly wanting more rights and deserving more rights , both economic and political , takes root in that country now . \nAnd maybe we 're at the time where it can . \nYou know , not every country can become a democracy at the snap of a finger , but Egypt might well be ready for it . \nAnd that would be the best outcome , as I say , of a lot of bad choices . \nMubarak can not continue in the long term with the oppressive regime he 's had now . \nThe demonstrators have shown that . \nCROWLEY : Let me turn you to domestic policy because it is budget season . \nIt is time to raise the debt ceiling . \nOtherwise the U.S. is going to lose its ability to pay its debts . \nWhere do you see this fight going now ? \nBecause , basically , we have a very determined bunch of Republicans right now , particularly on the House side , saying , no way we 're going to raise this debt ceiling until we start doing some cutting . \nSCHUMER : Well , there 's even a problem before the debt ceiling . \nOn March 4th , the government funding resolution expires . \nAnd it seems that a lot of Republicans in the House want to risk a shutdown of the government if they do n't absolutely get their way . \nThat was a mistake when Newt Gingrich tried it in 1995 . \nIt will be a bigger mistake now . \nIt 's really playing with fire because , if they were to shut down the government , not only would horrible things happen like an inability of people to get Social Security checks , you ca n't fund the military , but ultimately , it risks the credit markets . \nThey are getting wary because of the large debt we have , which we have to get down , but if they feel that people are willing to shut down the government , you could risk the credit markets really losing some confidence in the United States Treasury , and that could create a deeper recession than we had over the last several years -- God forbid , even a depression . \nSo I would urge my Republican colleagues , no matter how strongly they feel -- you know , we have three branches of government . \nWe have a House . \nWe have a Senate . \nWe have a president . \nAnd all three of us are going to have to come together and give some , but it is playing with fire to risk the shutting down of the government , just as it is playing with fire to risk not paying the debt ceiling . \nCROWLEY : So , Senator , just quickly in the minute we have left , where do you see this going ? \nBecause it is not an unpopular position at this point for a politician to say , we 're spending too much , and if you ca n't come to an agreement with the Democratic Senate or the Democratic White House , why would it be so unpopular to say , fine , you know , if you guys wo n't agree , let 's just stop spending and see what happens ? \nSCHUMER : Well , let 's say two things . \nFirst , certainly , we in the Senate and the president believes we have to rein in spending . \nThe president called for a five-year freeze on spending . \nThat 's rather significant . \nIt saves $ 400 billion . \nBut you ca n't just demand your position , particularly the position has kept getting more and more and more over to the right . \nOriginally , they wanted to go down to the 2008 levels , now down to the 2006 levels . \nThat would cause huge problems . \nJust one little example : 3,000 food inspectors would be fired , risking the health of our food ; 4,000 FBI agents , risking both safety on the streets and antiterrorism . \nSo what government is all about is having strongly held views , but when not everyone agrees with you , coming to a reasonable position . \nWe can come to a reasonable agreement that curbs spending . \nWe Democrats showed that when we supported the bipartisan session , McCaskill 's proposal , in the last -- in the last budget . \nBut to just stay in your corner and say , `` It 's my way or I 'm shutting down the government , '' that could lead to terrible , terrible problems . \nAnd I would plead with my new Republican colleagues in the House who seem to want to do this , that that is playing with fire . \nPlease do n't do it . \nCROWLEY : Senator Chuck Schumer out of New York , thank you so much for joining us today . \nWe really appreciate it . \nNext ... CROWLEY : CNN will continue to cover this developing story in Egypt and elsewhere and bring it to you , the latest , as it happens . \nThank you so much for watching `` State of the Union .

{"id": "1", "time": "2011-01-30", "text": "ANDERSON COOPER , CNN ANCHOR : Just some of the dramatic developments we have seen over the last 24 hours here as the sixth day of protests in Cairo and throughout Egypt have come to an end and the seventh day is just beginning . \nIt is 5:00 here in the morning . \nWe 're going to have continuing complete coverage all through this hour from here in Cairo , also in Alexandria , also in Washington , where Wolf Blitzer is standing by and also in Atlanta , where Isha Sesay is standing by . \nOur coverage continues as it has where for this many -- now going on seven days . \nAs I said , dramatic developments today . \nMohamed ElBaradei , the Nobel laureate who returned to Egypt just on Thursday , appeared in Liberation Square today , which is the central point where a lot of the protests are taking place here in Cairo . \nHe spoke to the crowd . \nWe 'll show you what that was like in just a moment . \nThe curfew is still in effect . \nThough , as you will see in Liberation Square , people defied the curfew in order to come out in large numbers . \nRight now , the streets around downtown Cairo are relatively calm , pretty empty , except for the heavy presence of Egyptian soldiers manning tanks and many of the intersections , many of the roadblocks . \nThere are also large civilian militias , just people , ordinary civilians who have armed themselves with kitchen knives , with bats , with clubs in order to try to protect their neighborhood since police are no longer visible on the streets here in Cairo . \nThough we have gotten a report from the government that police will be returning to the streets in a few hours on Monday . \nWhether or not that actually occurs and what kind of an impact that 's going to have , we 're just going to have to wait and see . \nHere 's what we saw , though , after the curfew , about three hours after the curfew went into effect at 4:00 on Sunday . \nWe went to Tahrir Square , to Liberation Square , and here is what we saw . \nCOOPER -LRB- voice over -RRB- : Sunday night , the sixth day of protests in Liberation Square , was once again filled . \n-LRB- on camera -RRB- : They 're calling for freedom and change and justice . \nThose are the words you will hear a lot . \nAnd they 're saying that their demands have n't changed , they want Mubarak out . \n-LRB- voice over -RRB- : Defying Mubarak , defying the curfew , thousands showed up shouting into the night . \nCOOPER -LRB- on camera -RRB- : What 's remarkable about this is -- for those of us who have reported from Egypt over the years is before , anytime you brought out a camera , instantly police would be all over you , stopping you from shooting , checking your papers . \nWe have a camera out . \nNobody is stopping us . \nAnd people are voicing their opinion . \n-LRB- voice over -RRB- : There is no one organizer of these protests . \nBut tonight , Mohamed ElBaradei showed up to try to talk to the crowd . \n-LRB- on camera -RRB- : ElBaradei is right over there the crowd . \nEverybody wants to get a look at him , wants to hear anything he might have to say . \n-LRB- voice over -RRB- : The crowd rushed forward , and ElBaradei spoke briefly through the bullhorn . \nMOHAMED ELBARADEI , EGYPTIAN OPPOSITION FIGURE -LRB- through translator -RRB- : Today , you are an Egyptian demanding your rights and freedom , and what we started can never be pushed back . \nCOOPER : His words were eloquent but few heard what he said . \nAnd the noise in the Square was simply too great . \n-LRB- on camera -RRB- : What is your message to President Mubarak ? \nCOOPER -LRB- voice over -RRB- : Soldiers on tanks watched and waited . \nThere were no police to be seen in the Square on this night . \n-LRB- on camera -RRB- : Are you scared to be here ? \nThere 's no -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- , so nothing to be scared of . \nCOOPER -LRB- voice over -RRB- : There 's no telling how much longer this can go on for six days into the crisis and there is still no clear way for it to come to an end . \nCOOPER : And Nic Robertson has been reporting from Alexandria . \nHe was out today with protesters in the streets , where the soldiers were shooting overhead . \nDid n't seem to have much impact , though , on the crowd . \nAgain , the crowd is defying curfew to voice their opinions in the streets of Alexandria . \nNic also looked into -- trying to get an understanding of how these protests are being organized and coordinated with Internet service shut down in many places . \nIt is a very difficult task . \nHere 's what he found . \n-LRB- BEGIN VIDEOTAPE -RRB- NIC ROBERTSON , CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT -LRB- on camera -RRB- : We 've come to this apartment building because it is where a secret meeting is taking place . \nThe people that helped organize the demonstrations are now having a meeting to try and organize security here and we 've been brought into this secret meeting . \nHello , how are you doing ? \nALI REGAL , STUDENT ACTIVIST : Nic , how are you ? \nROBERTSON : English would be great , yes . \nREGAL : Now we are trying to make a plan , strategic plan for -- to close all the borders of Alexandria and the places where we are seeing -- the districts where we are seeing well-structured -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- and vehicles and all this stuff we are hearing in the news . \nROBERTSON : To protect the -- to protect the population , yes ? \nREGAL : Yes , to protect the population . \nNow , there are a lot of popular committees everywhere , as you can see . \nBut we are trying to close some critical points on different places on the borders . \nROBERTSON : How is it going so far ? \nREGAL : Well , so far , it 's starting to develop , so we hope we can finish it by 5:00 or 6:00 . \nROBERTSON : And what about the Army ? \nAre they -- are you working with the Army ? \nREGAL : Yes , the Army is very helpful and working with us and it 's a great cooperation between the masses and the Army . \nROBERTSON : Do you feel that the Army is on your side or the president 's side at the moment ? \nREGAL : Look , I can not be sure of this . \nBut what I 'm very sure is there is a strong cooperation between the masses and the Army . \nThat 's what I can tell it so far . \nCOOPER : Nic joins us now from Alexandria . \nI 'm amazed at how brave these people you spoke to seem to be . \nI mean , they do n't seem to be frightened . \nWe are having a problem with Nic 's connection . \nWe are having a problem with Nic 's connection . \nWe 'll try to link up with him a little bit later on throughout this hour . \nBut again , the ability for protesters to try to communicate and organize , it is a very difficult thing . \nMohamed ElBaradei , who returned to this country on Thursday , said that he is in touch with some of the protest organizers and in communication with them , has been working with them and that they 've all agreed on the need to form some sort of a national unity government or transitional government if and when Hosni Mubarak steps down . \nBut again , there is no sign of that . \nNo indication that the president of Egypt , who has been the president for some 30 years now , is willing to do just that . \nWe 're going to continue our coverage throughout this hour . \nLet 's check in with Wolf now in Washington . \nWOLF BLITZER , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Anderson , thanks . \nAs the protesters are organizing , analysts are trying to figure out what happens next . \nWhat would President Mubarak 's departure mean for Egypt 's peace with Israel , for example , and how would U.S. - Middle East relations be impacted ? \nSamer Shehata is an assistant professor of Arab politics at Georgetown University here in Washington . \nHe is joining us now . \nHow popular is Mohamed ElBaradei in Egypt ? \nCould he emerge as the next leader if Mubarak goes down ? \nPROF. SAMER SHEHATA , ARAB POLITICS , GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY : He certainly could emerge . \nAs far as his popularity , he has a wide - ranging popularity among intellectuals , among some elements of the middle classes . \nHe 's relatively unknown among broader segments of the society . \nBut something very interesting happened yesterday . \nThe Muslim Brotherhood announced that they were supporting Mr. Baradei as an interim leader for Egypt . \nThat , I think , is very , very significant , because before these events , before last Tuesday , they were considered the largest opposition movement . \nSo I think he is emerging , certainly , as one of , if not the most important potential leaders in a democratic Egypt in the future . \nBLITZER : He is well-known to a lot of us . \nI 've met him on many occasions . \nFormer head of the International Atomic Energy Agency . \nWould he -- assuming Mubarak goes down and everybody seems to think it 's only a matter of time , would he likely emerge ? \nWould Omar Suleiman , the new vice president , emerge ? \nSHEHATA : Well , it depends how Mr. Mubarak goes down . \nIf Mr. Mubarak simply resigns and then Omar Suleiman takes over as president . \nMr. Baradei still excluded . \nThe regime can still try to maintain itself . \nCan say that we 've made a concession , we 're moving forward . \nI do n't think that would be accepted . \nPeople are calling for the removal of Mr. Mubarak and a change of regime . \nFreedom , change and social justice . \nSo -- however , If the entire regime were to collapse , if the protest were to continue and overwhelm the regime as it were , then I think you would have an interim government and Mr. Baradei would certainly be a part of it . \nBLITZER : I 've heard that Mrs. Mubarak has already left Egypt , maybe in London , that Gamal Mubarak , the son , already in London . \nI do n't know what you 've heard but there are a lot of reports out there that they have left . \nWhat are you hearing ? \nSHEHATA : I 'm hearing the same thing and I 'm hearing the same thing from multiple sources , from British sources as well as Arabic satellite sources , that they are in London right now . \nAnd we also heard yesterday and this , I think , was confirmed that there were 17 or 18 private jets that departed from Egypt and landed in the Emirates and they included a number of very prominent Egyptian businessmen , including Naguib Sawiris , the 64th richest man in the world , telecommunications mogul , as well as Ahmed Ezz , a hated National Democratic Party figure who resigned several days ago . \nBLITZER : If President Mubarak steps down and everybody seems to think that 's going to happen , could he stay in Egypt or would he have to flee , go to London , or go to the Emirates , go to Saudi Arabia , someplace else ? \nSHEHATA : Well , again , it depends on what happens next . \nIf Omar Suleiman becomes president and somehow the regime can maintain itself , and I do n't think that 's a likely scenario , then Mr. Mubarak would have the cover of Omar Suleiman being president . \nIt would be somewhat like -- and this analogy is n't perfect - a Gerald Ford - Richard Nixon moment . \nHowever , if the protesters continue , and I think this is more likely , and it overwhelms the state , then Mr. Mubarak will have to flee for his life and -- but the point is that people now are saying that he needs to be held accountable . \nHe needs to be held accountable not only for 30 years of authoritarianism but for the damage that he has caused Egypt and the lives that have been lost over the last few days . \nBLITZER : Samer Shehata of Georgetown University , thanks so much for coming in . \nBLITZER : I know you 're watching this especially closely because you still have family , a lot of family in Egypt right now . \nWe hope all of them are OK . \nSHEHATA : Thank you . \nBLITZER : Thanks so much for joining us . \nIsha , this is a story with a lot of developments happening right now , and I know you want to update our viewers on what we know . \nISHA SESAY , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Yes , absolutely . \nWolf , thank you . \nHere is what we know . \nFor American citizens who want out of Egypt , help is on the way . \nU.S. State Department says chartered evacuation flights will start taking off soon . \nAnybody taking one of those planes will have to reimburse the cost of their seat . \nSeveral other governments are also scrambling to get their people out . \nU.S. officials are monitoring the situation but treading carefully . \nDefense Secretary Robert Gates spent part of his weekend on the phone with his counterpart in both Egypt and Israel . \nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton pointed to President Mubarak 's speech a few days ago , saying it 's time to back up his talk of democratic and economic reform with action . \nAnd we 've seen the protests recently out of Tunisia , Yemen and now Egypt . \nSo , where could this anti-government sentiment spread next in the region ? \nThat is the big question . \nThe next domino could be Syria where a very restrictive Ba'athist regime has been in charge for four decades now . \nI think you can bet Syrian leaders are watching events in Egypt very carefully tonight . \nNow , back to Anderson in Cairo . \nCOOPER : Isha , we show a force today by the Mubarak regime . \nFighter jets flying low over Liberation Square at the beginning of curfew around 4:00 this afternoon . \nWe 'll show you what impact it had on the protesters in the Square , probably not the impact President Mubarak had hoped it would have . \nAlso in the hour ahead , we 're going to look at the roots of this uprising , roots that started not in Egypt but elsewhere in the region . \nWe 'll explain ahead . \nYou have also two choice . \nThe first choice , Mubarak leave , and the second choice , we die here . \nWe have no choice . \nCOOPER : Just one of the many voices we have heard today . \nNic Robertson , now we lost communication with him a short time ago . \nWe 've re-established it . \nHe 's joining us now from Alexandria , which is to the north of where we are in Cairo . \nNic , you spent time with some of the protest organizers over the last 24 hours . \nHow are they organizing thing ? \nHow are they handling this protest , getting the message out because Facebook , Internet is shut down in most places ? \nROBERTSON : You know what 's incredible , Anderson , these guys are a bunch of young students , some of them lawyers , some of them studying such things as security in society . \nThey 're reduced to drawing maps on pieces of paper to try and figure out who gets to guard which neighborhood , how long they should be there , those sorts of things . \nSo they 're trying to be effective but the mechanism , the Internet that they used to spread the word before to build these protests and get them out on the streets , they do n't have access to that . \nYou have a lot of groups now competing within the different neighborhoods for sort of dominance . \nYou see , you have this sort of intellectuals , if you will , the students , you have the Muslim Brotherhood , who you 'd see now corralling the demonstrations , a bigger presence in the demonstrations . \nAnd even one neighborhood , and I show you this here that we picked up , a flyer , driving through one of the neighborhoods past the vigilante group . \nThey handed this out to us this evening . \nAnd this is from a group , an Islamist group more radical , way more radical than the Muslim Brotherhood . \nThey 're demanding an Islamic state in Egypt . \nSo you have all these different groups . \nAnd it 's quite clear that over time , a struggle is going to evolve between them . \nWho controls what , where ? \nWho has the power ? \nThat is something that appears to be coming down the line , Anderson . \nCOOPER : And President Mubarak has certainly used concern in the West and even concern here about Islamic fundamentalists to his advantage over these last 30 years as a way to stay in power . \nOn the streets here though , there has been an uptick in the involvement of folks from the Muslim Brotherhood and other organizations . \nIt does not seem to have a very religious cast to it . \nYou see a lot of young students , a lot of people who are talking about freedom . \nDo you see -- is that the way it is in Alexandria as well ? \nROBERTSON : You know , I think what you 're seeing here is the -- what the Muslim Brotherhood are doing is keeping the demonstrations peaceful . \nThey 're keeping -- when the demonstrators are out on the main roads here , they 're keeping one side of the road open for traffic , keeping the demonstrators on one side , keeping it under control . \nWhy is the Muslim Brotherhood doing this ? \nWell , there really are no sort of strong opposition groups that have the organization and influence that they do . \nSo they are really stepping in to fill a vacuum . \nAnd they say themselves very clearly that they are moderate Islamist group , non-violent . \nBut , of course , they 're policies in the region are vastly different from President Hosni Mubarak 's . \nAnd they do look at the United States and they do look at Hosni Mubarak as sort of being side by side in a policy that keeps , they feel , the Palestinians down . \nSo , they are voicing on the streets now . \nWe 're seeing for the first time today here , very loudly , really , an anti-U.S. sentiment and we have n't seen that up to now . \nBut that is sort of emerging , Anderson . \nCOOPER : And you can -- I do n't know if you can hear in the background now , call to prayers . \nIt is just after 5:00 a.m. here , day seven of this uprising . \nOne of the more dramatic moments that we talked about a little bit ago was when F-16 fighter jets flew low over Liberation Square around 3:00 or 4:00 on Sunday afternoon . \nOur Ivan Watson was actually there on the ground when they flew over . \nHere 's what he saw . \nIVAN WATSON , CNN CORRESPONDENT : This is an unmistakable show of military force , fighter jets flying low over Cairo 's Tahrir Square , Liberation Square , which has been a symbol of defiance . \nCOOPER : And Ivan Watson joins us now . \nAnd we said it before , but that did not have probably the impact or the effect that whoever ordered those planes to fly overhead wanted . \nIf anything , people said they were not going to be intimidated . \nIf it was a means to try to intimidate people , though , you know , there were the soldiers in the Square at the same time , and the demonstrators were handing out sandwiches and bananas and tea and taking photos with them on their tanks . \nSo , perhaps getting mixed messages from parts of the Egyptian military right now . \nCOOPER : You know , before I came here , you hear , well , look , there 's a curfew at 4:00 . \nYou kind of surmise -- that means there 's an effort to impose that curfew . \nIt does n't seem like seeing the soldiers are really trying to impose the curfew . \nWATSON : And they 've been -- they 've been a little bit more forceful , I think , and they were not allowing people to demonstrate here the way they had done two days ago , let 's say . \nBut so far , they are allowing people to move around . \nI think what 's interesting , again , is the neighborhood watch groups that have sprung up , who have taken upon themselves to stop cars , to search them . \nAnd now in the second vigil night that they 're doing this , they have -- again , these are not people who are trained to be security officers . \nThey 're doing things like setting up their own signal systems , using whistles , for instance , so that they can call for help from one block to another . \nAnd I was talking to one man who said they had already been attacked around 9:00 p.m. People trying to climb over the walls of their compound and break in and they were actually scaring off these types of criminals . \nCOOPER : We 'll have more from Ivan throughout this hour and then obviously in the days ahead here in Cairo . \nWe 're also , of course , joined throughout this hour by Wolf Blitzer in Washington and Isha Sesay in Atlanta . \nWell , the uprising in the Middle East did n't begin in Egypt but it was spread across several Arab countries . \nWe 'll take you through events over the last several weeks . \nBLITZER : And we 'll also hear from our own Ben Wedeman , who lives in Cairo with his family , has been on this story from day one . \nHe 's got a dramatic story to tell . \n-LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- We need freedom . \nAll these people need freedom . \nAnd we need you to support us in our situation . \nCOOPER : A lot of anger , a lot of frustration and also a lot of pride . \nYou hear people say that a lot . \nThey 're very proud to see their fellow Egyptians out on the streets , calling for freedom , calling for an end to the Mubarak regime . \nAgain , what can of an impact that will have , how long these protests can continue before something gives is not clear . \nDay seven has already begun here and no one can really anticipate what the next 24 hours will bring . \nJoined again by Wolf Blitzer in Washington , Isha Sesay in Atlanta . \nSESAY : Anderson , there 's no doubt about it . \nEvents unfolding in Egypt at lightning speed . \nBut the seeds of unrest were planted long ago . \nBLITZER : And indeed , within a span of only four weeks . \nrevolt has spread across three Muslim countries in the Middle East . \nCNN 's Suzanne Malveaux tells us where the spark was lit . \nSUZANNE MALVEAUX , CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT -LRB- voice over -RRB- : Starting with Tunisia , where an unemployed graduate student sets himself on fire after a city inspector confiscates his unlicensed fruit card and then allegedly slaps him . \nHis death sparks unprecedented fury and protests against the government , forcing Tunisia 's longtime president to flee . \nIn Algeria , riots break out over rising food prices and a housing crisis . \nIn Yemen , students take to the streets . \nEmboldened by its neighbors in the region , on Tuesday , Egypt erupts . \nAngered by the alleged corruption , police brutality and lack of reforms in their own country , thousands pour into the streets , demanding Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak , who 's held power for nearly three decades , resign . \nProtesters are met with tear gas and violence . \nThe next day , the violence escalates as Egyptian security forces turn water cannons and tear gas on the growing angry crowds . \nThe Egyptian military urges calm . \nSocial media sites like Facebook and Twitter report that they 're being blocked by the government . \nThursday , a leading Egyptian opposition figure , Mohamed ElBaradei returns home from Europe , vowing to back the protesters . \nThe Egyptian government then arrests a prominent leader of country 's largest opposition group , the Muslim Brotherhood . \nThe Obama administration is alarmed by the growing intensity of the crisis but reacts with caution . \nBARACK OBAMA , PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES : I want to be very clear in calling upon the Egyptian authorities to refrain from any violence against peaceful protesters . \nMALVEAUX -LRB- voice over -RRB- : As the unrest spreads beyond Cairo in the days to come , protesters take to the streets in Qatar and Jordan to show demonstrators their support . \nMubarak goes on national television to tell Egyptians his government will resign but he will stay in power . \nHis offer does not quell the angry and growing crowds . \nA thousand inmates break out of a prison outside Cairo . \nLooters ransack prison buildings and businesses . \nAnd vandals tear off the heads of mummies at the Egyptian museum . \nJournalists report a dangerous power vacuum . \nBEN WEDEMAN , CNN SR. . \nINTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : The Army is sort of controlling the streets . \nPolitically , there 's a complete vacuum . \nMALVEAUX -LRB- on camera -RRB- : President Obama is trying to focus on some key domestic issues this week , including immigration and education . \nBut senior administration officials are keeping a very close eye on what happens in the Egyptian streets and whether or not President Hosni Mubarak survives . \nCOOPER : That is obviously a very open question -- whether or not he can survive . \nHe has survived for some 30 years . \nHe has many cards in his deck . \nWe have yet to see him play his full hand . \nWe 're going to have our continuing coverage . \nWhen we come back , we 'll talk with Ben Wedeman who is in the neighborhood . \nHe actually lives in here in Cairo , trying to literally protect the street that he lives in , along with his neighbors . \nHe went out on an armed patrol with his neighbors , something that is happening on just about every block in nearly every neighborhood that we have driven through . \nPeople manning checkpoints by themselves with knives and clubs to protect from the concern about looters . \nWe 'll talk to Ben in his home , coming up . \nUNIDENTIFIED MALE -LRB- through translator -RRB- : Security forces fired at us and shot tear gas at us . \nMore than 15 people lost their sight and vision . \nOne was shot at right here . \nCOOPER : One of our reporters , Ben Wedeman , the best reporter we have in this region , has been covering this from day one . \nI want to show you -- we 're going to talk to him . \nHe 's actually in his community , the neighborhood where he lives in Cairo , concerned about the security of that neighborhood and actually went out on patrol with some of his neighbors who have taken matters into their own hands to protect the block that they live on . \nBut I just want to show you some of his reporting from way back on Tuesday . \nSeems like a long time ago , but it was just seven days now . \nThis is some of what he saw then . \nBEN WEDEMAN , CNN SR. . \nINTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT -LRB- via telephone -RRB- : This unrest is obviously going to have to cause some new calculations , political new calculations . \nAnyway , right now , I 'm overwhelmed with tear gas . \nVOICE OF UNIDENTIFIED MALE : Are you able to carry on or do you want to get to a place of safety , Ben ? \nWEDEMAN : I 'll do my best , Martin -LRB- ph -RRB- , I 'll do my best . \nI just have to keep my one eye open . \nCOOPER : Ben Wedeman joins us now . \nBen , I do n't know if that seems like a long time ago to you or short time ago to you . \nIt was just seven days ago . \nWhat surprises you most about what 's happening right now ? \nWEDEMAN : The speed of it , Anderson . \nIt 's been so fast , so dramatic , that really initially all of us , the press , the protesters , the government , police , everyone has been taken utterly by surprise simply how fast all of this has happened . \nAnd I was -- in fact , I was having dinner at somebody 's house just across the street from Tahrir Square the night before the first protests , and most of us seem to be of the belief that this would be a day of some protests , but life would go on . \nLife has just completely changed for everyone in Egypt since then . \nAnd we 're slowly starting to digest the significance of it all . \nBut it does seem that we 're coming to the end of an era here in Egypt . \nMost Egyptians I have spoken to say it 's just impossible for President Hosni Mubarak to carry under the pretense that he 's the president of all Egyptians -- Anderson . \nCOOPER : Uniformed police have been off the streets . \nThere is a report that police may come back tomorrow on Monday on the streets here . \nWe 're going to have to wait and see on that . \nAre the secret police , the plainclothes police , the ones who roughed you up several days ago and have roughed up a lot of people and dragged people away , are they still out on the streets ? \nWEDEMAN : It appears they are , although I think they 're keeping a fairly low profile and aware at this point that Egyptians have learned that they are powerful , too , and that they can fight back . \nIn my neighborhood , speaking to my neighbors , there 's a new awareness that what the police did , ordinary citizens can do , that is maintain security without the kind of petty corruption , without the police brutality that created such a negative aura around the police . \nAs far as the secret police is concerned , they 're not as apparent on the streets as before . \nBut , of course , the worry of many people is that given the orders , they can go back and create the same kind of havoc that we saw them doing during the days of protest -- Anderson . \nCOOPER : Just one final question , Ben . \nIn the United States , there 's concern among some quarters about Islamists gaining power , taking control here in Egypt if Mubarak left . \nThat is certainly something President Mubarak has used over his reign to continue Western -- to support Western support and to garner support here . \nHow realistic is that ? \nWhat sort of power do they have here in and , moving forward if Mubarak left , what sort of power would they have ? \nWEDEMAN : Most Egyptian analysts believe that if there were free and fair elections , that the Muslim Brotherhood and similar groups would win around 30 to 35 percent of the vote . \nBut certainly not only has the Mubarak government exaggerated the so - called Islamic threat in Egypt to the United States , but they did that to a great extent with the Egyptian people as well . \nEvery time elections would come around , they would send out a message , either you vote for Mubarak , who will protect secular liberal Christian Egyptians or you vote for the Muslim Brotherhood and you will pay the price . \nBut that sort of blackmail , so to speak , does n't really work anymore among ordinary Egyptians . \nThey see that the -- that the Muslim Brotherhood is n't the sort of threat that President Mubarak and the government always said it was -- Anderson . \nCOOPER : Ben , we 'll continue to check in with you . \nNow let 's go to Wolf in Washington . \nBLITZER : Anderson , American diplomacy right now facing a tough , tough test . \nU.S. strategic interests are colliding with the political uprising fueled by anger at a U.S.-backed president in Egypt . \nNick Burns is an expert at navigating global crisis . \nHe 's a former U.S. diplomat , was the undersecretary of state . \nHe 's now a professor at Harvard 's Kennedy School of Government . \nIn terms of -- on a scale of 1 to 10 , Nick , 10 being the worst crisis , where would you rate this one ? \nNICHOLAS BURNS , FORMER U.S. UNDERSECRETARY OF STATE : This is up to 8 or 9 already , Wolf . \nYou know , the consequences of instability in Egypt to the United States are really , really important . \nThis country , I think , is the most important U.S. partner in the Middle East . \nAnd so , as you rightly said , the strategic interests here of the United States are on the line . \nBut , as you know , and as President Obama and Secretary Clinton have been saying , we are a democratic country , we affirm our own democratic values , we have to support the right of Egyptians for freedom of speech and assembly , to demonstrate peacefully . \nAnd so , we 've seen a very difficult balancing act for the United States over the last seven days . \nBLITZER : Should the president of the United States pick up the phone and call President Mubarak and say , guess what , it 's over , it 's time for you to leave , begin that process ? \nBURNS : You know , I thought when President Obama spoke on Friday night , he got it just about right . \nHe made a quite forceful statement , for change in Egypt , for the government to open up , to allow reform , to move forward . \nI also thought it was appropriate for the president the other night not to call publicly for President Mubarak to resign . \nBLITZER : I 'm not saying publicly , I 'm saying -- I 'm asking privately . \nShould the president tell Mubarak privately it 's over ? \nBURNS : I was just going to say , Wolf , this is not all about us . \nIt 's really about the Egyptians . \nThey 're the ones who have to steer this forward . \nI think that President Mubarak seems to be losing control of the streets of Alexandria and Cairo . \nThe shocking absence of security forces , the disorder and the mistakes that President Mubarak made last week in using excessive force against the demonstrators . \nSo I think it is appropriate at some point in the next day or two for the U.S. to be saying privately that the government has to move forward . \nThat means that President Mubarak has to declare publicly , I think , that he 's not going to run in the September elections nor is his son , Gamal , that he 's going to open up this process to a truly -- in a truly democratic way to allow people like Mohamed ElBaradei , whom you saw on the streets of Cairo today , to contest these elections . \nAnd I think if he does n't do that , we 're going to see rapid change on the streets and rapid change politically in Egypt . \nBLITZER : Is it your sense that the longer he delays that , the worse potentially it is for everyone ? \nBURNS : My sense is that President Mubarak -- President Mubarak is a very serious , sophisticated , experienced person . \nAnd I had hoped that he would see the need last week to allow for a process of reform to begin . \nHe has n't done that . \nBy appointing Omar Suleiman as his vice president is really just more of the same , it 's military power . \nThe military is an important institution in Egyptian society . \nWe should hope that the military will back a period of transition , a period leading to elections and hopefully allow for civil society to grow in Egypt as the country has never known democracy in its entire history , to give the Egyptian people a chance in an orderly , peaceful way towards an election . \nWolf , that 's the best thing that I can see happening now , but the government of Egypt needs to get behind that and make it absolutely clear that it favors reform . \nIt has not done that yet , and you see the crowds growing in the streets of Cairo and Alexandria . \nBLITZER : Yes , that would be the best-case scenario if in fact that happens from the U.S. perspective and from the Egyptian perspective . \nBut at least as of right now , everything that President Mubarak is saying does n't indicate he is ready to give up , at least not yet . \nNick , thanks very much for joining us . \nBLITZER : Isha , let 's get back to you . \nISHA SESAY , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Wolf , coming up , a walk through the dangerous streets of Alexandria and Cairo . \nOur CNN reporters take you straight to the scene of what is becoming a lawless situation with looting and gunfire . \nSESAY : Plus , CNN senior international correspondent Nic Robertson is in the ancient port city of Alexandria , where Egyptians marched through the streets after curfew with gunshots providing a scary soundtrack . \nThis is the start of the rest of my life , the new happy life , honestly , as cheesy as it sounds , that 's exactly how I feel right now . \nSESAY : I 'm Isha Sesay at CNN headquarters in Atlanta , joined by my colleagues Wolf Blitzer in Washington D.C. and Anderson Cooper , who is in Cairo . \nWe continue to cover the events in Egypt , where social order is collapsing with frightening speed . \nReports of widespread looting and lawlessness are rampant . \nLate Saturday night , we received word of a massive prison break near Cairo . \nCNN took a flight and went there Saturday to investigate what was clearly a dangerous and deadly situation . \nFREDERIK PLEITGEN , CNN CORRESPONDENT -LRB- voice over -RRB- : When we got to the prison in Abu Zaabal , a gun battle was still raging inside . \nThe residents advised us to leave . \nInmates had escaped , they told us , and stolen many weapons from the building 's arsenal . \nThe problem is not just that the prisoners got out , this man told us . \nThe problem is the prisoners got out and took all the weapons with them . \nThe townspeople later told us looters later stormed the prison and went on a shooting rampage and that there were still dead bodies on the premises . \nAnd no police around . \nA total breakdown of law enforcement . \nWe came past half a dozen abandoned police stations looted and torched . \nLocal citizens are banding together , arming themselves , trying to protect their neighborhoods . \nIn this neighborhood , they stopped a stolen car full of armed men , one carrying an automatic weapon . \nOne of our -- one of our friends hit them with a stick . \nThe guy with the machine gun . \nSo he starts shooting everywhere and then they fainted . \nPLEITGEN : Irrigation engineer Ahemd Abdul Latif and his son are part of a community defense force . \nRecently , they 've gotten help from the Army . \nLatiff says his wife and daughter are scared and did not want to be filmed . \nAHEMD ABDUL LATIF , IRRIGATION ENGINEER : I protect myself with anything I have , anything I have in my hand , anything , tools , my car tools , I used my car tools . \nPLEITGEN : He blames one man for the upheaval overtaking his country . \nLATIF : Thank you , Mr. Mubarak . \nI want to thank him very much for this situation we are in . \nWe want to -- we want him -- please , Mr. Mubarak , please , thank you very much . \nPLEITGEN : Latif and the others will probably have to spend more nights with their clubs defending their houses . \nStill , they say , these days are days of hope , even as chaos seems to reign . \nFred Pleitgen , CNN , Cairo , Egypt . \nCOOPER : It is incredible just how , you know , you drive through neighborhoods and literally every block , you are stopped by six , a dozen young men , old men , armed with all sorts of weapons , makeshift weapons , clubs , kitchen knives , they check out who you are , they want to see some sort of identification . \nAnd then , when they realize you 're not a looter , they 're generally friendly and tell you to move on . \nBut it 's block after block after block . \nIt 's very difficult now just even getting anywhere in Cairo because of the time it takes to get through all these -- all these roadblocks . \nWe 're going to have our continuing coverage all the way through this evening . \nWhen we come back , we 're going to take a look at what happens if President Mubarak does step down and does leave Egypt and what happens if he does n't . \nROBERTSON : The demonstration is getting much closer to one of the Army post . \nSo the gunfire that we can hear rocketing through the air , the demonstrators say that 's the Army firing to warn them to stay away . \nIt 's long ... ROBERTSON : More gunshots . \nIt 's long after curfew right now . \nAnd if the government was controlling the situation ... ROBERTSON : Trace of fire flying in the air . \nThese people - BLITZER : Nic Robertson doing some amazing reporting for us from Alexandria . \nWith Egypt appearing to be on the brink of new leadership , right now analysts are trying to connect the dots on how it will impact the new future if President Mubarak is out and everyone seems to think he will be out , it 's only a matter of time . \nWhat will happen to Egypt 's peace with Israel , for example . \nIf a new president comes in , how will that affect U.S. relations throughout the region ? \nLet 's discuss with Professor Fouad Ajami He 's professor of Middle East Studies at the Johns Hopkins University 's School of Advanced International Studies . \nProfessor Ajami , if the president of the United States called you right now and said , Professor Ajami , what should we do , what would you tell President Obama ? \nPROF. FOUAN AJAMI , MIDDLE EAST STUDIES , JOHNS HOPKINS UNIV. : Well , I have a feeling this president would not call me because I have been very critical of him . \nI think there is something wrong with our posture toward Egypt . \nThere is something wrong with the American inability to connect with the aspirations of the Egyptians for a change . \nThere is something wrong with our secretary of state saying that the Egyptian regime is stable when she knew better . \nThere is something wrong with our Vice President Biden saying that Hosni Mubarak is not a dictator when every child in Egypt that we see and every reporter is showing you insists that Hosni Mubarak is a dictator . \nSo I think there is some real chaos . \nNot only there is chaos on the streets of Cairo but there 's really chaos here on our end -- what to do about Egypt and how to understand Egypt . \nBLITZER : So what should the U.S. do ? \nAJAMI : Well , I think , look , it 's a long story and we have come to this -- I mean , this Egyptian protest is happening without any inspiration from the United States . \nI mean , if you really look at what 's happening , not only in Egypt but if you widen the lens , and you take a look at the Arab world as a whole , you see that there is a kind of irrelevance of American power because , in fact , the message was sent out early on in the Obama administration , that we do not interfere in the internal affairs of this autocracies but we are invested in these autocracies . \nOur treasure is invested in Egypt , and we have this longstanding interest in Egypt , and we are very timid because we insist that should the despot fail , should the despot be removed , should he and his family leave , we insist that Egypt has no other option but Islamic fundamentalism . \nIt 's a kind of intellectual poverty , and it 's hard . \nBLITZER : If President Mubarak were watching CNN International right now and he might be , we do n't know if he is , but look in the camera and talk to President Mubarak and what would you say to him ? \nAJAMI : Well , look , President Mubarak had -- he 's been in power , as we all know , 30 years . \nI think he had 12 good years . \nHe was the son of Egypt . \nHe was a man who rose from the Armed Forces . \nHe cared about his country . \nHe was a modest man . \nThere is a general who was of Mubarak 's generation and Mubarak 's class , if you will , in the military , who described Mubarak to me as a civil servant with the rank of president . \nThis is long gone now . \nSo , 12 good years he rendered service to the Egyptians , then finally he put together this unbelievable autocratic state . \nThe Ministry of Interior has 1.7 million people working for it . \nThe whole treasure of Egypt and the effort of Egypt and the effort of Mubarak has not been about developing Egypt , solving the poverty of Egypt , dealing with the problems of Egypt . \nIt 's been about simply the police state that he has put together , and there was a demeaning of Egypt to insist that a son of his would have to be president . \nI mean , to be tempted to go that dynastic route , over 80 million people , the pact between Mubarak and his people has really been severed and broken . \nHe can only do one thing now for the Egyptians . \nHe can simply step aside , as the Egyptians over and over again , when you hear , when you see these crowds , they 're saying one word , derhal -LRB- ph -RRB- , which means just be gone , leave . \nAnd this is really what -- there is -- the moral pact of Mubarak is severed . \nBLITZER : Tunisia , Egypt , what 's next ? \nThe next six months , look ahead for us , Professor Ajami . \nWhat do you see ? \nAJAMI : Well , you know , it 's very hard . \nAs someone said , it 's hard to predict particularly the future . \nWe do n't really know . \nWe do n't even know if this upheaval , this tsunami that hit the Arab world -- look a man in Tunisia sets himself ablaze in a forgotten , forlorn Tunisian town and then you see the envy of Tunis , the Tunisia envy , if you will , in every Arab county . \nWhat you have are these decadent regimes , autocratic regimes ruled by old men , ruled by people who loot these countries , whether it 's Libya , whether it 's Syria , whether it 's Algeria , whether it 's Tunisia , whether it 's Egypt . \nThose are a band of regimes ruled by a man at the top with dynastic ambitions for their families , an incredible access to the treasures of the land , and a kind of cruelty toward the people . \nAnd I think the discrepancy between these young sophisticated people in the streets and these old autocrats , we are seeing a crisis of the civilization in front of us . \nBLITZER : Fouad Ajami knows a lot about the Middle East for disclosure . \nHe was my professor of Middle East Studies at Johns Hopkins University . \nProfessor , thanks so much . \nWe always learn from you and we hope to be learning for many , many more years . \nThanks very much for coming . \nAJAMI : Thank you very much , Wolf . \nBLITZER : Let 's go back to Anderson . \nAnderson , you 've been there now , what -- only a few hours , but give us your biggest impression . \nWe flew in this morning . \nAnd it was interesting just flying in , obviously the airport is congested with people trying to get out . \nIt 's a little surreal to me coming into the place that everyone is trying to leave from . \nIt 's sort of -- I guess we 're all pretty used to it here at CNN though . \nBut I talked to an American couple there who had been stuck for 48 hours . \nThey were trying to get a flight to India . \nFinally , they just gave up . \nThey were trying to -- decided to just go back into the city of Cairo . \nNot sure what they are going to do or how they are going to get out . \nWe now know the U.S. is going to start voluntary evacuations of American citizens on this day , on Monday , but again the organization is unclear . \nAnd it 's really unclear , Wolf , what 's going to happen over the next couple of hours . \nReally , as Ben Wedeman said earlier , this is happening so fast , no one can really predict , Wolf . \nBLITZER : It 's really going to be fluid and we 're going to watch it every step of the way . \nCNN will have complete coverage . \nCNN International as well . \nStay with us for all the latest developments on the uprising in Egypt . \nThanks very much for watching . \n"}

'' \nThe ascendance began in 1952 , when the military helped overthrow Egypt 's ruling monarch . \nIts support for a constitutional democracy and its performance in various wars and battles earned it the admiration of many Egyptians . \nCelebrations mix wth violence in Cairo `` There 's a good reason that the Egyptian military is held in pretty high esteem , '' said Peter Bergen , a CNN national security analyst , author and fellow at New York University 's Center on Law and Security . \n`` The army has done relatively well . '' \nAll males between ages 18 and 30 must serve one to three years , as the CIA World Factbook notes , meaning almost every family in Egypt has some personal connection to the military . \nStill , one of the military 's biggest assets in the eyes of everyday Egyptians may be that it is not the widely reviled security force . \nThe U.S. State Department has frequently blasted Egyptian police for torture and otherwise depriving citizens of their civil rights , including in its most recent 2009 Human Rights Report . \n`` They 're held in great disdain by their own population , for very good reason , '' Bergen said . \n`` They know that security forces have tortured literally thousands of people ... for almost any reason . '' \nThis animosity boiled over this week , when angry demonstrators burned and ransacked police stations . \nOn Friday , there were reports of casualties after police fought back citizens ' attempts to take the Interior Ministry in Cairo , the security forces ' headquarters . \nJust blocks away , in Tahrir Square , it was a very different and far more festive scene : Joyous demonstrators gathered near troops and embraced them , sometimes literally . \nThis showering of love on the military , which were deployed Friday to patrol the streets for the first time since the mid-1980s was repeated many times over throughout Egypt . \nVideo footage from Cairo showed some protesters celebrating by scaling tanks , with no repercussions . \nMany of them smiled and shook hands with troops on patrol , with one soldier even cradling a baby and posing for a picture . \nIn Alexandria , where at least 2,000 gathered in Raml Square on Saturday , protesters chanted , `` The military and the people together will change the regime . '' \nThat said , these same demonstrators were demanding the overthrow of President Mubarak -- a former hero in the Air Force and the commander-in-chief of the armed forces . \nHe has largely surrounded himself politically with other veterans , including Saturday 's appointment of Omar Suleiman -LRB- a former lieutenant general in the army -RRB- as vice president , the first time Mubarak has tapped someone for that role in his 30 years in power . \nExperts are n't surprised Mubarak has moved to align himself with the military even more so , recognizing the armed forces ' place in Egypt . \nStill , by doing so , he also created a quandary for the military : Do they back Mubarak , whom they report to ? \nOr do they support the people , having largely been among them not long ago and wanting to preserve their reputation ? \nAndrew Pierre , a senior fellow at the U.S. Institute of Peace , said he expects top military officials to remain loyal to the president . \nBut the rank and file are a different story , especially if they are called on to beat back civilians . \n`` They 're military people for two years or so , and I do n't know that they will be willing to shoot their brothers and sisters and families on the streets , '' Pierre said , adding that midlevel officers may be most torn and ultimately determine what happens . \nThrough the first five days of the crisis , the 450,000-strong armed forces appeared to trying to have it both ways : refraining from acting against demonstrators , but at the same time vowing to bring order . \nStill , even as it vowed to enforce a curfew from 4 p.m. Saturday to 8 a.m. Sunday , there were no signs of the military doing anything to the hundreds who roamed the streets regardless . \nTelhami , though , thinks that ultimately the military may have to decide where it stands : behind Mubarak or the protesters . \nAnd their decision , many believe , will determine Egypt 's future . \n`` It 's all going to depend ... on where the military will be , '' he said . \n"}

\nI think part of it goes to your point about not having a -- the numbers of reporters that we used to have in the Arab world in the Arab world . \nAnd also , by the way , because of that , and partially because of that , you do n't have the same amount of coverage on the nightly news , you do n't have the same amount of coverage in newspapers anymore . \nSo , I mean , most things are going to come to us as surprises these days . \nKURTZ : Laura Rozen , you ca n't predict the unpredictable , of course , but with these cutbacks , especially at the networks , news organizations just have fewer boots on the ground in places like the Middle East . \nLAURA ROZEN , `` POLITICO '' : Right . \nAnd it 's a vacuum that Al Jazeera English has totally stepped into , with many of us having it live-streaming from events in Cairo on our computers Thursday , Friday and Saturday , transfixed . \nKURTZ : That addiction may end because of Egypt now trying to kick Al Jazeera out of the country . \nWe 'll talk to the Washington bureau chief in just a moment . \nLet me go to Atlanta , Mohammed Jamjoom . \nThis battle , of course , playing out in the streets . \nWe 've all been watching this , glued to our sets . \nBut playing out on the Internet as well . \nAnd when the Egyptian authorities crack down on the Internet -- and I have read estimates that 93 percent of Egyptians can no longer get online -- how effective has that ban been ? \nHow is it that some people , for example , are still managing to send Twitter messages ? \nMOHAMMED JAMJOOM , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : Well , Howard , it 's been fascinating to see basically what the reaction was after the shutdown , because what you were seeing was not just people in the region , but people worldwide , online activism movements that were basically tweeting out and putting out social media messages for the Egyptian people on how they could circumvent the Internet blockage , because as you said , it 's about 93 percent blocked , it has been since Thursday , in the overnight hours , and it does n't look like it 's getting better any time soon . \nWe were seeing people tweeting from places like Yemen , where there is n't a lot of Twitter activity , giving numbers for ISPs in France so that people could use dial-up modems to get back online . \nA lot of online activists have been putting out messages on other ways they can do it , maybe even using Ham radio technology so that people in Egypt could continue to get the message out via social media even though the Internet was blocked . \nSo it 's just been absolutely fascinating to see this -- Howard . \nKURTZ : People can be very inventive when they need to be . \nJeff Jarvis , we 've reached a point where Hillary Clinton urged Cairo not to shut down social media , and Robert Gibbs , the White House spokesman , tweeting the other day , `` Government must respect the rights of the Egyptian people and turn on social networking and the Internet . '' \nSo , is Internet access now a human right ? \nJEFFREY JARVIS , `` BUZZ MACHINE '' : I think it 's exactly that , Howard . \nAnd it 's somewhat ironic in the fact that the U.S. government has been trying to shut down WikiLeaks . \nI think that the right to connect now becomes a fundamental human right , and the problem here , as we see , that government is the single point of failure for the Internet , whether that 's the kill switch , as Egypt has used it , or whether that 's the fact that they control the structure for the Internet . \nAnd so our future , the means by which we 're going to build the next society , is vulnerable here , and that worries me . \nAt the same time , I celebrate the fact that our people in a nation can use these tools to take charge . \nGOLDBERG : But Howard , there 's something very interesting going on here , which is I think the moment that the Egyptian government lost its international credibility was when it shut down social media . \nI mean , I think this is -- KURTZ : The Twitter factor , is that important ? \nGOLDBERG : I think the Twitter factor is actually important in people 's understanding around the world . \nIn other words , trying to suppress this revolution by shutting down Twitter , they completely undermined whatever legitimacy they had internationally . \nI think it was a turning point . \nKURTZ : You are certainly familiar with the region . \nYou 've been to Egypt . \nIn fact , I 'm told 11 years ago , you witnessed some violence in Egypt while you were there . \nGOLDBERG : No , no , no. . \nI got caught up in a riot 11 years ago during the Arab League summit . \nAnd it 's not a fun place to be , during an Egyptian riot , because the police , not the army , but the police are quite brutal , and they are very , very quick with tear gas . \nThere were a lot of reporters tear-gassed the day I was there . \nI escaped into a Kentucky Fried Chicken which was then looted . \nThat was the only reason I stayed out of the tear gas at that moment . \nKURTZ : It sounds like a harrowing moment . \nI want to ask you , Laura Rozen , about now that this has become the story dominating television and everywhere else , we have people with shows who maybe are not Middle East experts talking about what they think . \nLet me play a clip from `` The O'Reilly Factor '' from the other night on Fox . \nLT. COL. RALPH PETERS , FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR : Mubarak has conned us . \nHe 's done stuff for us , but we 've done a lot more for him . \nWe 've helped him stay in power . \nAnd he 's going . \nWhether or not he survives this immediate crisis -- BILL O'REILLY , `` THE O'REILLY FACTOR '' : No , he 's going . \nPETERS : -- he 's a dead man walking . \nKURTZ : Now , I do n't know what 's going to happen in Egypt . \nShould pundits be speculating like it was some presidential primary about whether Mubarak is going to be toppled or not ? \nROZEN : Well , it has been striking how this has become -- this international story has become the major domestic political story of the past four days . \nAnd you 've seen , you know , normal punditry talking about domestic politics and the State of the Union , turning their attention to the political dynamics of Cairo , which they may not know as much about as some of the experts you 've had on . \nSo it has been striking . \nKURTZ : Let me go back to Mohammed Jamjoom and ask you this question . \nYou know , it is easier for those of us who are not there , for those of us who are sitting at computers , to follow some of this story on places like Twitter and Facebook , despite the crackdown , despite the reduced traffic . \nI wonder if that maybe leads us to overestimate the role that these social networks play in what 's going on there . \nFor example , it 's not a representative sample of the country . \nPeople on Twitter are probably younger , more activists , perhaps more anti- government . \nJAMJOOM : Oh , that 's right , Howard . \nAnd that 's a debate that has been going on for days now . \nAnd it started with what went on in Tunisia . \nA lot of people have been asking in the region and outside the region , does social media really play an integral factor in this ? \nWhat we can say is that in the case of Egypt , it really played a critical factor in getting out the word on how to organize , on how to meet up . \nPeople were using Twitter and sites like Facebook to organize . \nThere was one group in Egypt that was one of the key groups getting people out in the streets . \nLast week , in a matter of days , they went from 20,000 fans of that page to 80,000 fans . \nThat 's just in one day , the traffic increased that much . \nNow , we can see these sites were used in order to get the word out how to bypass checkpoints , how to get across bridges , how to get to places where people wanted to demonstrate . \nSo it was a critical tool in getting people out into the streets , getting supporters of the movement out there . \nBut as you see , even after the Internet shutdown , people are still out there en masse . \nIt 's growing day by day . \nClearly , a popular uprising , a lot of anger . \nAnd the fact that the Internet was shut down added fuel to the fire . \nBut people are angry with the regime there , they are getting out . \nSo we ca n't say yet that it 's the whole reason that this is happening , but obviously it played a big role in getting people out there , getting the message across . \nROZEN : Similarly , Al Jazeera was reporting on Friday that 60 percent of its traffic was come from the United States on Friday , people watching the Cairo uprising . \nAnd you could see -- sorry . \nThe only point I would make in response to that is we 've had revolutions before Twitter -- KURTZ : I was about to ask that . \nGOLDBERG : -- and Facebook . \nThe Iranian Revolution , 1979 . \nThe American and French revolutions , by the way , no technology whatsoever . \nKURTZ : No Twitter then , no Facebook . \nGOLDBERG : No Twitter in 1789 or 1776 . \nSo -- JARVIS : Howie , can I jump in there ? \nKURTZ : Let me get Jeff Jarvis in there . \nJARVIS : Well , you know , I 'm researching my next book called `` Public Parts , '' and I 'm finding this debate about the chicken and egg question of Twitter and revolutions is not unlike that around Gutenberg 's press and the Reformation . \nIt 's really a rather meaningless debate . \nThe point is , if the Internet did n't matter , the Egyptian government would n't have been fueled necessarily to shut it down . \nChina would not have today blocked Twitter-like searches for the word `` Egypt . '' \nIt 's not as if -- as a blogger said in Egypt on Al Jazeera , `` Twitter did n't attack the police , the people did . '' \nPeople -LRB- AUDIO GAP -RRB- tools of transparency and organization are unquestionably having a role . \nKURTZ : Let me ask you , Jeffrey Goldberg , before we go to break , do you have a sense in this media coverage that journalists -- and it 's subtle , but that journalists are kind of rooting for the protesters , there 's not great sympathy for Hosni Mubarak , and perhaps not fully examining that , depending on how this goes , we could end up with an Islamic regime in Egypt that we might like less than Mubarak ? \nGOLDBERG : Well , we 're completely in uncharted waters right now . \nI do n't necessarily think that we 're going to end up with the Muslim Brotherhood regime . \nThey only have the support of a minority of Egyptians . \nOn the other hand , no one knows what 's going to happen . \nYou asked about punditry . \nIt 's very dangerous to punditize at this moment , because the Egyptians are in uncharted waters . \nIt 's a chaotic situation . \nGOLDBERG : And yes , of course people are sympathetic to the underdog . \nI mean , that 's -- look , let 's not make believe that journalists do n't axiomatically side intuitively or emotionally with the underdog . \nAnd these people on the streets seem like the underdog . \nAnd especially , they 're going up against the guy who has forcibly held power for almost three decades . \nGOLDBERG : For Americans , 30-year presidencies do n't sit well with us . \nThat 's not a good American idea . \nKURTZ : All right . \nLet me get a break . \nComing up at noon Eastern , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will talk to Candy Crowley to give the administration 's view of these fast-moving events . \nWe will be back to talk about just how much interest there is in this country in international events , at least when there are n't riots in the streets . \nKURTZ : We are continuing our coverage of the uprising in Egypt . \nAnd Jeff Jarvis , in Zurich , when Tunisia 's president was forced from office just about 10 days ago or so , it got a lot of newspaper coverage . \nI would n't say it was a huge television story . \nAnd I 'm wondering what you think about this . \nDo most television executives and producers believe that Americans do n't care about international events unless there 's riots in the streets or American troops are involved or American hostages are involved ? \nJARVIS : Well , Howie , I like what I just heard a moment ago , that it 's hard to punditize in these uncharted waters . \nI think part of the problem in this story , or these stories , is that the normal structure we know is n't what 's leading the story . \nIt 's not a government media structure . \nIt is an entirely new kind of power structure , quite uncharted , that comes out of the this ability of people to organize . \nAnd I think that story will become so compelling to people , and the debate around who 's really in charge , that it will become more important . \nJARVIS : Yes , I think it is a failing of national -LRB- AUDIO GAP -RRB- care about the world , we do . \nKURTZ : Do you think , Jeffrey Goldberg , that Americans and journalists , Western journalists , do care more about Egypt not only because it 's a big and important country , but because of the peace treaty with Israel and how that could be in play , depending on what happens here ? \nGOLDBERG : Look , Egypt is the center of the Arab world . \nIt 's the most populated country . \nIt 's a country we understand historically . \nWe 've been engaged there for a long time . \nAnd yes , I think when people think about it for 10 seconds , they understand that the entire stability of the eastern Mediterranean is due , in fact , to the Israel\\/Egypt peace treaty , which was , of course , brokered by the United States . \nWe know what happened -- you look at that area of the Middle East in the last 30 years , versus the Persian Gulf area , Iraq , Iran , and you can say , wow , the stability -- maybe artificial stability we 've had -- has been hugely important to us , and now we 're headed kind of off a cliff . \nWe do n't know where we 're going . \nKURTZ : Come back to your point earlier about -- you said it was pretty obvious that at some point , Mubarak would not be able to hold on to power . \nI 'm not talking about this week . \nAnd yet , at the same time , I read all these stories , I watch television , and I have very rarely seen even hints of that . \nIs there a fear of going out on a limb ? \nGOLDBERG : It 's a fear of going out on a limb . \nAlso -- but this goes directly to your point about the lack of foreign coverage . \nTo me it 's interesting , to you it 's interesting , to Laura it 's interesting to go out and interview jobless Egyptians , and look at the youth bulge in Egypt , and talk about how young men are so frustrated , they do n't have enough money to get married . \nBut that does not make compelling television , for one thing . \nThat 's a serious kind of long , investigative , almost , sort of story . \nThat 's not going to -- that kind of story does n't sail too well anymore . \nKURTZ : And it 's a gray area . \nIt 's not heroes and villains . \nIt 's not a clear plot . \nI mean , except now , when you have -- KURTZ : How difficult has it been , Laura Rozen , as a reporter covering the story here in Washington , to find out what they are really saying and thinking and planning and strategizing at the State Department , at the White House , which seems to be reacting to events in the last 72 hours ? \nROZEN : Very much . \nI mean , it 's been quite interesting . \nThere actually have been a group of Middle East experts and foreign policy establishment figures who , for a year now , have been pushing the Obama administration to prepare for the post-Mubarak era , and senators who have been trying to push Egypt for reforms . \nAnd it 's gotten stories , but it does n't rise to the top of the agenda until you have a drama like this . \nKURTZ : And when you 're in a drama like this , how hard is it for you to -- do they want to push a message out ? \nHow hard is it for you to find out what officials are saying privately ? \nROZEN : Their message is we 're meeting on it . \nYou know , Obama met for an hour yesterday . \nThe national security principals met for two hours yesterday . \nWe 're on it . \nThey 've been trying to be neutral in an event where it 's very hard for the United States to look neutral because they give so much -- you know , $ 1.5 billion a year to Mubarak . \nKURTZ : Is this not calibrating a little more distance from the Mubarak regime than at the beginning ? \nROZEN : Either giving -- you can see every day , similar to the Iran protests a year and a half ago , that the administration 's getting pushed now to distance themselves from Mubarak . \nKURTZ : And before we go , Mohammed Jamjoom , let me come back to the question of social media networks . \n`` The New York Times '' had an interesting piece this weekend saying that just as Twitter or Facebook can be very effective as an organizing tool , it makes it easier for an authoritarian government to track down dissidents by following the electronic trail . \nJAMJOOM : Oh , that 's right , Howard . \nAnd that 's one of the things that 's key in trying to cover this , is trying to focus on if these people that have been tweeting out , or using Facebook , being online activists in the region , if they are being harassed -- I mean , we have seen many times in the course of the past few years groups like the Committee to Protect Journalists or Human Rights Watch really condemning authoritarian regimes in that region for their mistreatment , alleged abuses of bloggers , of social media users . \nWe 've seen it repeatedly happen in Saudi Arabia . \nWe 've seen a lot of allegations of abuse in Egypt as well . \nAnd so there 's a real risk for these people that are out there . \nEven though they might be caught up in the moment , and even though a lot of the bloggers that are in Egypt that have been utilizing Twitter so much have been saying this is our moment and we need to go out into the streets as much as possible now , even though we 're in danger , the fact of the matter is they could be in danger -- Howard . \nKURTZ : All right . \nThank you very much , Mohammed Jamjoom . \nJeff Jarvis , over in Zurich , Jeffrey Goldberg , Laura Rozen , thanks for joining us . \nAhead , we 'll talk to the Washington bureau chief of Al Jazeera about the sudden ban by Egyptian authorities in that country . \nAnd we 'll also talk some political coverage , State of the Union , Michele Bachmann . \nIt 's all ahead on RELIABLE SOURCES . \nKURTZ : Since the crisis in Egypt erupted , one network has provided more exhaustive coverage than anyone else . \nThat would be the Arab satellite channel Al Jazeera . \nThat may be about to change , getting word this morning that Egyptian authorities trying to basically kick Al Jazeera out of the country , close its offices , yank its accreditation . \nHere 's some of what Al Jazeera 's coverage has looked like on the air . \nDAN NOLAN , AL JAZEERA ENGLISH : Down here , on the grounds of this compound , you can see that every vehicle in sight here has been set alight by protesters . \nThey stormed this compound last night , they did n't spare any vehicle . \nThere must be 50 vehicles in total . \nAll of them have been torched by protesters furious with President Mubarak . \nKURTZ : That clip obviously from Al Jazeera English . \nAnd joining us now to talk about these developments is the Washington bureau chief , Abderrahim Foukara . \nThank you very much for coming in . \nABDERRAHIM FOUKARA , WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF , AL JAZEERA : Nice to be with you . \nKURTZ : Why was Al Jazeera singled out by Egyptian authorities ? \nI mean , the BBC is there , CNN is there , there are other television operations there . \nAnd yet , they are trying to -- Egyptian authorities are trying to basically exclude you from any further coverage . \nWell , Al Jazeera 's coverage of these events is , as you said in your introduction , the most comprehensive in the region . \nWe 've seen a similar situation in Tunisia . \nThe coverage of recent events in Tunisia has really provided millions and millions of people around the region to see what was actually going on in Tunisia , and taking into consideration that what 's going on in Egypt was actually , in some ways , sparked by what was going on -- what happened in Tunisia . \nAnd then you begin to get the picture of why the Egyptian government has done what it 's done . \nKURTZ : The state-run television in Egypt has said that Al Jazeera has been lying , exaggerating . \nThe number of protesters , for example , that we 're seeing this morning at Tahrir Square , they 're saying there are really only hundreds there , though the CNN estimate was 10,000 . \nSo you 're being attacked on journalistic grounds . \nFOUKARA : Well , I mean , this is not a new situation with Al Jazeera . \nWe 've seen this in many different parts of the Arab world , where the governments of various countries go in one direction , but the viewers in that same country go in a different direction . \nAl Jazeera has been accused of incitement , for example , in Iraq in 2004 , and the U.S. offices were closed down . \nThey continue to be closed down . \nNow we 're seeing this in Egypt . \nThe fact of the situation remains that for Arabs , for more than any other viewership in the world , this is a crucial story . \nAnd for the Egyptian government , no matter what its grievances are with Al Jazeera , to shut down its operations in Egypt , it 's something to seriously think about . \nKURTZ : You talk about incitement . \nBill O'Reilly , on Fox News the other day , said that Al Jazeera is spurring on this revolt and encouraging uprisings all over the Muslim world . \nFOUKARA : Well , look , what 's -- the coverage of Al Jazeera is being criticized by some governments , it 's being criticized by people outside of the United States . \nBut to the people who are actually demonstrating , whether in Tunis or in Cairo or in Yemen or in Jordan , is a source of reliable information not only if what goes on in their own countries , but what goes on in the neighborhood . \nSo we may differ with certain governments on the definition of what trustworthy coverage is . \nThe fact of the situation is that the viewership , the people who are directly involved in these events , they come to Al Jazeera because that 's where they feel with some trust they can air their grievances and their aspirations . \nKURTZ : Ironically , one of the reasons that Al Jazeera is barely a presence on the airwaves in the United States is because of criticism that it 's been pro-Arab and anti-American . \nI 'm sure you would reject that , but , of course , the Arab position is not always uniform , as we 're seeing in Egypt . \nIs it fair to say your journalists are not only better connected with , say , those involved in this Egyptian protest , but are sympathetic to those who are trying to topple what has been an authoritarian regime for nearly three decades ? \nFOUKARA : Well , the viewership , but certainly the protesters -- look , Al Jazeera has invested in gaining the trust of its viewers around the Middle East for over a decade . \nKURTZ : You 're there all the time , not just -- FOUKARA : We 're there all the time . \nIn times of crisis , I mean , even in Egypt , you would see that local television stations can compete and have been able to compete with Al Jazeera in normal times . \nBut in times of crisis , whether it 's the situation in Tunisia , or in Gaza , or in Iraq , most of them flock to Al Jazeera . \nKURTZ : What about my question about whether your journalists are sympathetic to people who are trying to gain some measure of freedom ? \nFOUKARA : Well , the message of Al Jazeera has been that we are actually going to provide a platform for people who want to air their grievances and their aspirations right across the spectrum . \nAl Jazeera would tell you -- and the coverage shows , too , whatever extent you want to determine it -- that they also give a platform to people who want to criticize it ; namely , governments in the region . \nKURTZ : And these are people who often do n't have a platform , which is why folks like the authorities in Egypt seem angry at Al Jazeera . \nI mean , it 's just a question of who do you trust ? \nObviously , governments do not trust Al Jazeera much . \nBut the people , the viewership , and now , especially , the protesters , they certainly do see in it a way of getting the message across not to their fellow citizens -- not just to their fellow citizens , but to Arabs elsewhere in the region . \nKURTZ : I 'm coming up on a break . \nBut I 've got to ask you , to what extent will Al Jazeera be able to continue to cover this crisis in Egypt if the offices are closed , the phone lines are cut , if the satellite privileges are denied ? \nFOUKARA : It is a problem , but it 's -- as I said earlier , it 's a problem that Al Jazeera has experienced in the past , and it learned to adapt to it . \nAl Jazeera will continue to cover events in Egypt either by inviting people from outside of Egypt to come and give their opinions on what 's going on , but it 's also through its network of contacts inside Egypt who may not necessarily provide information on air , but they will provide it off air . \nKURTZ : Abderrahim Foukara , thank you very much for coming in this morning . \nComing up in the second part of RELIABLE SOURCES , we 'll look at former `` TIME '' correspondent Jay Carney taking on the job of White House spokesman . \nPlus , Michele Bachmann gets almost as much attention after the State of the Union as President Obama . \nAnd CNN is getting flak for airing her response . \nLater , we 'll take a break from protests and politics with this story -- why did sportswriters rough up a Chicago Bears quarterback who insisted he was hurt ? \nKURTZ : When it comes to cable news , all members of Congress are n't created equal . \nOn the left , Democratic Congressman Alan Grayson , who just lost his seat , got plenty of exposure on MSNBC for saying such things as the Republican health plan for sick people is `` die quickly . '' \nOn the right , Republican Congresswoman Michele Bachmann became a Fox News star -- she occasionally pops up on other channels as well -- for saying such things as Barack Obama may have anti-American views . \nBut more incendiary is why the bookers go after them . \nSo when a brainy , budget-cutting hawk , Paul Ryan , delivered the official GOP response to the president 's State of the Union , it was Bachmann who made news by making a video appearance for the Tea Party Express thanks , in part , to this network . \nWOLF BLITZER , CNN ANCHOR : I just want to remind our viewers , the only place they 'll see on television that speech live , Michele Bachmann 's Tea Party speech , will be right here on CNN . \nREP. MICHELE BACHMANN -LRB- R -RRB- , MINNESOTA : After the 7 $ 700 billion bailout , the trillion-dollar stimulus , and the massive budget bill with over 9,000 earmarks , many of you implored Washington to please stop spending money that we do n't have . \nRACHEL MADDOW , MSNBC : But tonight , inexplicably , a national news network decided that they would give Michele Bachmann a job that her own party never did . \nCNN ran it live on their network . \nThey aired it on national TV . \nA remarkable act of journalistic intervention to elevate , in effect , at group with which they are cosponsoring a presidential debate , to elevate that group to the level of the major parties in this country . \nKURTZ : So what did the good folks at MSNBC spend the next day talking about ? \nI 'll give you a hint . \nIt was n't Paul Ryan . \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : Everybody in this room has probably looked at the wrong camera . \nLAWRENCE O'DONNELL , MSNBC : You know , I 've got a room full of cameras here , and I feel like this could happen to me at any moment . \nCHRIS MATTHEWS , MSNBC : Did she skip the entire financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 ? \nKURTZ : So did CNN make a mistake in airing Bachmann 's speech ? \nJoining us now to talk about that , and the way most pundits handled the president 's State of the Union , Margaret Carlson , columnist for Bloomberg News and Washington editor of `` The Week '' magazine ; Michael Shear of `` The New York Times , '' the lead writer for `` The Caucus '' blog ; and Jim Geraghty , contributing editor at `` National Review . '' \nSo , Margaret , did CNN elevate Bachmann unfairly , as Rachel Maddow says ? \nMARGARET CARLSON , BLOOMBERG NEWS : Well , Bachmann makes herself news . \nI mean , she 's -- the Republicans create people like Michael Steele and Sarah Palin and Bachmann . \nShe belongs to the Bachmann party . \nShe is on her own . \nShe always makes news . \nShe 's always colorful . \nShe 's always incendiary . \nAnd we cover news , and she 's always willing to make it . \nKURTZ : Jim Geraghty , if journalists are going to talk about Bachmann all the time , then what 's the big deal for CNN to give her five minutes for that video so that people could see what it is they would then be debating ? \nJIM GERAGHTY , CONTRIBUTING EDITOR , `` NATIONAL REVIEW '' : Well , I think it 's worth noting , this is really the first year -- maybe you could argue last year -- that any type of Tea Party response would be justified . \nBefore then , there just was n't this kind of social movement . \nI think if nothing else , novelty justified putting it on the air and just seeing how people responded to it . \nNow , my fear is , you know , a year from now , the Coffee Party will want to have its response , the progressive -- everybody and their brother -- GERAGHTY : Exactly . \nEverybody and their brother will say , well , look , I represent a separate faction that my own party does n't speak for me . \nThus , I 'm going to need my own separate five minutes . \nAnd before you know it , it will be a weeklong celebration of State of the Union responses . \nKURTZ : Well , good luck with that . \nCNN saying in a statement , `` The Tea Party 's become a major force in American politics , '' to your point , `` and within the Republican Party . \nSo , therefore , hearing the Tea Party 's perspective on the State of the Union was something that would benefit viewers . '' \nAnd I do n't disagree with that at all . \nBut what explains this media fixation with Michele Bachmann ? \nShe 's not part of the leadership . \nShe is colorful , to be sure . \nMICHAEL SHEAR , `` THE CAUCUS '' BLOG : Look , I think , you know , I , as all journalists , love the fascination of waiting to see what she might say , and that it might be newsy and over the top . \nBut I think there 's a serious point here , too , which is that she represents what is a broader story about the divisions within the Republican Party . \nAnd there 's serious divisions . \nIt 's going to be a story from now and throughout the 2010 campaign , and I think showing that helps readers , reviewer understand what that division might be . \nKURTZ : And Paul Ryan , who actually has a serious and controversial deficit-cutting plan , nobody was talking about him for the next 48hours . \nHe 's probably not that happy . \nTurning now to the State of the Union , I want to show you some of the pundit reaction . \nAnd I would have to describe it as tepid . \nMADDOW : The mood of tonight 's speech was somewhat subdued right from the start . \nCHARLES KRAUTHAMMER , FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR : It was like late Clintonian minimalism . \nThis , I think , was one of his weakest speeches . \nHe tried hard , but it was flat , I thought , uninspired . \nROLAND MARTIN , CNN POLITICAL ANALYST : Not one mention of the poor in this speech . \nNot even a mention of the middle class in this speech . \nKURTZ : So , Margaret Carlson , the pundits , on balance , were pretty unenthusiastic , but the public loved it , 84-93 percent in a CNN and a CBS poll , giving positive marks to the president . \nWhat accounts for that split ? \nCARLSON : This is a split you always get . \nRemember , during Clinton , every speech was a laundry list . \nThe public wants to know , oh , what 's going to happen to my mortgage ? \nOh , what 's going to happen to my -- they like specifics . \nOn this one , the same thing happened , although I did n't find this -- if you 're judging this within State of the Union , it was n't a bad speech . \nIt had a beginning , a middle , and an end . \nThe ending , I thought , was really quite good , where he talks about the small businessman who builds the drill , takes it to Chile , it rescues the miner , but the guy who did it left because he did n't want to take attention away from the miners . \nAnd he used that to say we can do big things . \nAnd then he did that refrain . \nAnd it ended unlike Paul Ryan , on this upbeat note . \nI thought it was one of the best State of the Unions I ever heard . \nKURTZ : Jim Geraghty probably not going to endorse that view . \nBut I 'd like to know your thoughts on why it seems that people often like these speeches -- and this was true under Bush as well -- a lot more than the professional commentariat . \nOne of my old mentors who I nicknamed `` Obi-Wan Kenobi '' says Americans like to see the president being the president . \nGo out in the Rose Garden , go out and address whatever major issue of the day it is . \nWhen you give the State of the Union , everyone 's standing , they 're applauding . \nThey 're reacting to you as if you 're presidential leadership , even if the speech is flawed . \nNow , even if you like it , I 'm going to ask you whether anybody 's going to really remember anything two weeks from now , or it will all be overtaken by what 's going on in Egypt , because Candy Crowley got her power back on , or whatever crisis of the day . \nI think people -- KURTZ : Well , it was a crisis when I did n't have my power on this week after a five-inch snowstorm here in the capital . \nBut Michael Shear , you know , it seems to me you ca n't win . \nThe pundits , before the speech , said these speeches are always a laundry list . \nWe do n't want a laundry list . \nWell , Obama did n't really do a laundry list . \nHe did a more thematic speech , and the reaction in some corners , as well , was , too vague , he did n't have any specifics . \nI mean , in some ways , it was the Obama administration 's attempt to move to the middle not on the political spectrum , but on the spectrum of how these speeches are traditionally done . \nAnd so it was kind of a little bit of specifics , enough to satisfy the public , a little bit of thematic , enough to kind of step back a little bit and be above it all . \nKURTZ : But maybe it was also a slight move to the middle politically , five-year spending freeze , talking about torte reform and medical cases , and maybe the liberal media did n't like it that much . \nSHEAR : Well , although , interestingly enough , if you talk to the right , they do n't see it as I 'm sure -- CARLSON : Yes . \nKURTZ : But it 's different than in good times , when you stand up and you say , I say we go to the moon and we have lots of new expensive programs . \nWell , the person who will be defending the president in just a couple of weeks is Jay Carney , former `` TIME '' magazine correspondent , now the communications director for Vice President Biden . \nHere 's what he had to say a while ago about the job he 'll now be inheriting . \nJIM CARNEY , INCOMING WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY : The best press secretaries were very deft at serving both their boss , the president , the White House , the administration , and the press , and not -- it 's a tricky job . \nI 'm sure I would n't be any good at it . \nKURTZ : Margaret Carlson , you 're a former colleague of Jay Carney 's . \nYou 're a friend of his . \nWill he be any good at it ? \nWell , I know Robert Gibbs , and he 's no Robert Gibbs . \nAnd he will be able to cross over a bit . \nI mean , he will be able to straddle these two worlds , as he has shown he can do with Joe Biden . \nHe 's almost , like , too nice to be in journalism . \nAnd people do like him almost inordinately . \nI think he 'll do it really well , just the way he did Biden . \nKURTZ : But can a career journalist be partisan enough ? \nBecause people in the White House , undoubtedly , when there are leaks , will suspect him of being a media sympathizer . \nGERAGHTY : Linda Douglass did it . \nThere are plenty of former reporters who have ended up on this . \nAnd I 've got to say , you know , can he handle the pressure or the stresses of the job ? \nI figure at some point , being Joe Biden 's press secretary was going to show up on Mike Rowe 's `` Dirty Jobs . '' \nIn other words , if you can handle cleaning up the messes or the inevitable PR explosions that occur when Joe Biden goes before the cameras , I imagine this is going to be the truest kind of step into a more relaxing role as White House press secretary . \nKURTZ : But as White House press secretary , this is really the first working reporter since Ron Nessen was named by Gerald Ford in 1974 . \nTony Snow was a commentator . \nUsually , presidents like political PR professionals . \nSo this is going to be a different experience for the press ? \nI mean , from all we can tell , the White House specifically wanted a journalist . \nAnd Bill Daley , the new White House chief of staff , wanted a journalist . \nAnd there have been a lot of grumblings in the White House , as there always are in the press corps , about relations with the White House press office . \nAnd so this is going to be a different approach . \nAnd he 's going to have to prove to the press corps that he 's got the kind of access , that he knows what he 's talking about . \nHe 's not really an Obama intimate , and so he 's going to have to get into that mix and show that he can -- KURTZ : I want you all to call me when Carney starts yelling at you about your stories , and we 'll know he 's made the transition . \nJim Geraghty , Michael Shear , Margaret Carlson , thanks for joining us . \nComing up at noon Eastern , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will talk to Candy Crowley about the unfolding events in Egypt . \nComing up next on this program , roughing the passer . \nSportswriters slammed Chicago Bears quarterback Jay Cutler for taking himself out of a championship game . \nIt turns out they were dead wrong . \nI 'll throw the flag on this one . \nKURTZ : Professional sports tends to be a macho world , especially pro football . \nAnd most especially with the Super Bowl on the line . \nSo when quarterback Jay Cutler took himself out of the Chicago Bears lineup in last Sunday 's NFC championship game against the Green Bay Packers , the sportswriters and commentators practically booed him off the field for saying he was injured . \n`` The San Francisco Examiner '' : `` Many Bears fans in the Windy City are giving Cutler the one-finger salute , and it ai n't with a pinky . '' \nYahoo Sports : `` He walked onto the field in the second half after he supposedly injured his knee . \nSo was he hurt ? \nUnless an MRI scheduled for this week says his ACL is torn to shreds , it 's going to be hard for Bears fans to believe he was . '' \nWell , the MRI exam showed that Cutler suffered a serious knee injury . \nWhat does that say about the sport 's loudmouths ? \nJoining us now from Las Vegas , Jason Whitlock , national columnist for FoxSports.com . \nAnd Jason , let me read from your column . \nYou say , and I quote , `` I apologize . \nI 'm at guilty as anybody . '' \nWhat are you pleading guilty to ? \nJASON WHITLOCK , FOXSPORTS.COM : Well , that column was about not lifting the conversation about Jay Cutler where it needed to be . \nI think that the initial criticism of Cutler was about toughness , and I think the kid had already proven his toughness . \nThe conversation needed to focus on his mental makeup and whether Jay Cutler has the right mental frame of mind to be a quarterback in the NFL . \nBecause even with the injury that he had , other players , other quarterbacks have found a way to gut it out , give a better effort , and try to play in that game . \nAnd Jay Cutler seemed to appear to mentally check out of that game . \nAnd so I was apologizing for not taking the conversation to a higher level . \nKURTZ : All right . \nYou know , we talked earlier on the program in a much more serious context about the role of Facebook and Twitter in the Egyptian uprising . \nYou bring up Facebook and Twitter in this same column . \nYou say that `` Cutler got overrun by a social media flash mob . '' \nIn other words , he was getting savaged on these social media sites . \nI think that 's where we 're at in the sports world . \nI think it happened to LeBron James after his off-season decision about going to the Miami Heat . \nPeople take to Twitter . \nAthletes -- Jay Cutler 's peers in the National Football League took to Twitter and savaged him over Twitter . \nAnd I think we need to be careful in the media in taking athletes or anyone at their exact word on Twitter . \nIt 's only 140 characters . \nYou ca n't express a full opinion . \nYou ca n't really express half an opinion . \nTwitter is easily misinterpreted . \nWe have people that are n't seasoned communicators on Twitter saying inexact things , not really what they really mean , but all they can think to say at that time . \nKURTZ : But you 're on -- WHITLOCK : And so sometimes in the media we have to step back . \nKURTZ : But you 're on Twitter all the time . \nAre you expressing one quarter of opinions given the space limitations ? \nI tell people , you know , enjoy my Twitter feed , judge my columns . \nBecause in my columns , I can say what I really think . \nOver Twitter , you really only have a chance to be sarcastic or snarky . \nIt 's not a place to express full opinions . \nKURTZ : All right . \nWell , whether it 's on Twitter , or in a column , or on television , the fact is the sportswriters here were wrong . \nPeople were piling on this guy , saying he was n't really injured , and he was injured . \nAnd I have n't heard anybody apologize to him . \nWHITLOCK : Well , I do n't think people were saying he was n't really injured , because , trust me , in the National Football League , guys play hurt all the time . \nI think people -- there is a difference between being injured and being hurt , and I think people were saying maybe Jay Cutler was just hurt and he should have figured out a way to keep playing or give a better effort to try to keep playing . \nListen , guys in the National Football League , guys in NBA , guys in Major League Baseball play with hurt all the time . \nThey play with slight MCL , ACL sprains all the time . \nKURTZ : And on that point -- WHITLOCK : I think some of his -- KURTZ : On that point , before we go -- I did n't mean to cut you off there -- I mean , you played football at Ball State . \nAnd you were -- once played 11 games with a torn ACL . \nKURTZ : Did that influence your view of the Jay Cutler situation with the Bears ? \nWHITLOCK : It influences my view in terms of I 'm -- just because the Bears have come out and said he had a grade 2 MCL tear , I 'm not going to just take them at their word . \nYou know , team doctors -- any time you 're playing sports for a lot of money , there is a lot of pressure on the guys to get back out on the field . \nThere 's a lot of pressure on the doctors to get players back out on the field . \nAnd so my situation as a college football player makes me skeptical of anything that a doctor says . \nAlways get a second , third , fourth opinion . \nI 'm just not going to accept what a team tells me . \nKURTZ : All right . \nGot to get you off the field now , but Jason Whitlock , we appreciate your getting up early to talk to us about this a week before the Super Bowl . \nKURTZ : Still to come on RELIABLE SOURCES , Salon fesses up to an error , a long-ago error . \nAnd can everyone please just stop with the Nazi analogies ? \nBill O'Reilly versus Jon Stewart in our `` Media Monitor . '' \nKURTZ : Time now for the `` Media Monitor , '' our weekly look at the hits and errors in the news business . \nHere is what I liked . \nSalon stepping up to the plate and correcting an error , even if is five years late . \nThe piece was by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. , and it argued that a compound of vaccines was dangerous and linked , in his view , to autism in children . \nDays later , the Web site ran five corrections , but now the liberal site has deleted the piece entirely . \nThis , in response to a book by Seth Mnookin called `` The Panic Virus . '' \n`` Rolling Stone , '' which published the same article in print , has also deleted it online . \nSalon 's new editor , Kerry Lauerman , made the decision , and former editor Joan Walsh was quoted as saying , `` I regret we did n't move on this more quickly as evidence continued to emerge debunking the vaccines and autism link . \nBut continued revelations of the flaws and even fraud tainting the science behind the connection make taking down the story the right thing to do . '' \nI 'm not sure that digitally erasing the story is the right move . \nMaybe people should be able to look up the discredited article . \nAnd I 'm not taking a position here on the thorny autism debate . \nBut I 'm glad Salon did n't sweep this one under the proverbial rug . \nHere 's what I did n't like . \nI thought media gave much of a pass last week to Democratic Congressman Steve Cohen when he used a most unfortunate historical analogy to describe the Republican attacks on Obamacare . \n-LRB- BEGIN VIDEO CLIP -RRB- REP. STEVE COHEN -LRB- D -RRB- , TENNESSEE : Just like Goebbels , you say it enough , you repeat the lie , you repeat the lie , you repeat the lie , and eventually people believe it . \nKURTZ : Yes , he went the Nazi route . \nBut did you see a lot of reports on his inflammatory language ? \nI did n't either . \nMSNBC , which is so interested in Republican incivility , did n't do much , although Ed Schultz interviewed the Tennessee congressman , who eventually apologized . \nThe network that really bashed Cohen by bringing up the Holocaust was Fox News . \nAnd I have no problem with that . \nBut Jon Stewart did , especially after Fox anchor Megyn Kelly challenged the guest , who said such analogies were hardly unusual on Rupert Murdoch 's network . \nMEGYN KELLY , FOX NEWS : I do n't know if you sit and watch our programming every night , but I watch it every day , and you 're wrong . \nGLENN BECK , FOX NEWS : The real answer is the Nazis were using early American progressive tactics . \nAnd that 's not my opinion . \nThat 's historic fact . \nO'REILLY : If you look back at what happened in Germany , you can not escape the similarities between what Hitler and his cut throats did back then and the hate-filled blogs , what they are doing now . \nJON STEWART , `` THE DAILY SHOW '' : Oh , Roger Ailes did it in a print interview , saying of the NPR executives who fired Juan Williams , `` They are , of course , Nazis . \nThey have a kind of Nazi attitude . \nThey are the left wing of Nazism . '' \nKURTZ : I remember that one since I did the interview . \nO'Reilly responded that `` The Daily Show '' selectively edited the clip , failing to show that he was responding to an ugly remark about Nancy Reagan by some commenter on `` The Huffington Post . '' \nO'REILLY : If he were a journalist , I would pound him into pudding . \nBut he 's not . \nHe 's a comedian . \nAnd as such , has license to take things out of context for entertainment purposes . \nSTEWART : Hey , why do you use the Nazi reference ? \nIt does n't really matter in this . \nThe segment was to show , contrary to Ms. Kelly 's statement that it 's not the type of rhetoric used on Fox News , that it actually does appear quite frequently . \nThat 's all it was . \nKURTZ : I , for one , would be much happier if everyone , pundits and politicians , just would swore off these Nazi analogies . \nBy the way , MSNBC taking a step towards civility after Keith Olbermann 's departure . \nThe network is ending Ed Schultz ' `` Psycho Talk '' segment in which the host accuses various conservatives of being kind of crazy . \nThis was n't voluntary . \nSchultz says , `` I work for somebody and I do n't call the shots . '' \nJoin us against next Sunday morning , 11:00 a.m. Eastern , for another critical look at the media . \nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton is on `` STATE OF THE UNION '' this morning . \nThat begins right now . \n"}

{"id": "142", "time": "2011-02-10", "text": "Few things to date have energized popular Egyptian protests against President Hosni Mubarak as much as the emotional interview given by Wael Ghonim , a 30-year-old Egyptian internet activist , almost immediately after his release from 12 days of detention by the feared state security police . \nIt is fair to talk now about a second stage in the protests against Mubarak 's government as thousands of ordinary Egyptians cast aside their doubts and joined to make the street protests the next day the biggest yet . \nWhy did this one interview , this one person , so galvanize the protest movement ? \nBecause it was the first time ordinary Egyptians heard a protest leader passionately defend the revolt , free from the vicious anti-protester propaganda of the state-dominated media . \nJournalists from the state controlled-media themselves joined the revolt and started reporting the truth . \nFor two weeks , Egypt 's state-dominated media had engaged in a campaign of lies and slander against the democracy protesters , accusing them of being funded by outside conspirators as diverse as the American CIA , Iranian spies , Israel 's Mossad , Qatar 's Al-Jazeera television station and Hamas . \nOne television interview featured a fake `` protest organizer '' who claimed there were 23,000 guns inside the demonstrators ' camp on Tahrir Square , and that the protest had been taken over by bearded fundamentalists\\/Islamists . \nThe tactics , crude as they were , made many ordinary Egyptians doubt the sincerity of the protest movement and helped unleash a wave of xenophobic violence that gripped Cairo on February 2 and 3 . \nAnd then there was Ghonim on TV on Tuesday , disheveled , unshaven and blinking into the camera after so many days of being blindfolded in incommunicado detention , suddenly facing a national audience on one of Egypt 's few semi-independent television channels . \nHe had been the driving force behind the Facebook page `` We are all Khalid Said '' -- dedicated to the memory of the 28-year-old Egyptian man beaten to death in Alexandria last year by two undercover policemen -- which soon became a central organizing vehicle for the mass protest movement that has shaken Egypt 's ruling elite . \nOn January 27 , the eve of the first of several massive Friday protests in which the police left the streets after daylong clashes , Ghonim literally disappeared into the dark hole of Egypt 's security services . \n"}

{"id": "151", "time": "2011-02-10", "text": "February 10 , 2011 | By Joe Sterling , CNN Save the Children and other NGOs are concerned that Egyptians are endangering their children by bringing them to protests . \nAs fighting erupted across Egyptian society , Save the Children , an international aid group devoted to helping poor boys and girls , and other agencies watched their world and work start unraveling . \nThe group said in a February 3 statement that eyewitnesses reported that many in the protests are children , and that the clashes in Egypt `` put thousands at risk of death , injury and psychological trauma . '' \n`` The combination of a highly charged atmosphere , rival political protesters , and weapons on the streets puts children in grave danger , '' said Jane Gibreel , Save the Children 's country director in Egypt . \n`` We want to send a clear message to all Egyptians that they have a responsibility to protect their children . '' \nOther international non-governmental organizations operating in Egypt share this concern and fear about the unrest . \nThey realize that `` it 's no longer business as usual , '' said Kevin Fitzcharles , CARE director in Egypt . \nThe heads of several missions are gathering on Monday , and plan to discuss preparing contingency plans to respond to emergencies and the implications of the changes rippling through society . \nMost international non-governmental organizations -- which forge partnerships with local NGOs to carry out projects -- had to suspend their work after the anti-government protests erupted . \nOne is Plan Egypt , an organization that provides a range of programs for poor children and their families . \n`` All of this activity is on hold at the moment , '' said Edward Abbey , country director of Plan Egypt . \nThere have been two main reasons for the delay , which affected 200 employees , Abbey said . \nIt was too dangerous to go to work . \nAnd , the group works closely with the Ministry of Social Solidarity . \nSo when the government shut down , Plan Egypt could n't coordinate with that ministry . \nOnly a handful of employees are back to work for Plan Egypt and Abbey said they are replanning projects . \nThe group hopes it can get back to normal soon . \nAyman Ramsis is country director of Diakonia , which addresses human rights , gender equality , and other matters . \nHe also heard unsettling reports and rumors that children were engulfed by the anarchy , with some moving to Tahrir Square for security and food and even some who were paid by police to attack demonstrators . \nWhile the country and the NGO operations are slowly getting back to normal , these problems show that Egypt ca n't return to the state it was in before the protests broke out in late January . \n"}

February 13 , 2011 at 1:38 am | Report abuse | Can someone ask how women are involved in this and how do they plan to incorporate THEIR rights in this `` freedom '' from the repressive govt of Mubarak ... thanks William , , ur a true MORON and u need to be keept in a ZOO . \nur a thug and lowlife go hide in shame idiot `` The director of the CIA was saying he would step down . . \nwhat happened '' -- Hey Piers , it 's called democracy , and it should n't be up to the CIA to make the calls on Egypt 's regime . \nIf America is truly interested in the spread of democracy , they will allow the Egyptian people to choose who to govern their country . . \nunless the US wants Egypt choosing Palin 2012 ? \nFor CNN , i was whatching aljazeeras less than an hour ago for a good while and they talked to a white house advisor , who seemed to have just come out of the white house , who said among a lot of other interesting things that the Obama administration are now nearly decided that the change cant take place with Sullieman and Mubarak in power . \nIt has seemed to me that the white house thought the change could go on with mubarak keeping things calm while they sorted out something new , mind you i have not been following the news in th elast twenty four hours much , it is a big change if the White House think the effort to move on to a democratic government can not happen with Mubarak in power . \nTHey also were saying that america does nt have much influence but i never know how seriously to take claims that they dont have much influence . \nrose macaskie Yes both Thugs Mubarak and Suleiman must be arrested and put on trial for murder and massacre , as well as the whole dectatorship regime of Mubarak . \nWatching this unfold in Egypt is both inspirational and reminiscent of the `` change '' young Americans came together for in our last election . \nI hope Mubarak funds the decency and backbone to accept his defeat and steps down peacefully . \nI am so happy with the change we 've had so far -- more of my family and friends have left -LRB- lost -RRB- their jobs , and owe more to the banks than ever . \nMeanwhile , the same staff have the same positions as before we had our ` change ' . \nSooooooo happy for the Change ! \nI am concerned that Mubarak has not taken a firm stance with his countrymen that `` Time is needed to form firm candidates for an election '' with the possibility of an election come June or July '' . \nI , personally have no evidence of any real candidates on any of the new programs . \nThe Egyptians have a real grievance but due process must take place for change . \nThe White House is taking a neutral approach as always to play the winning card . \nUnfortunately , the U.S government stands for liberty and democracy when it suits them ????? Toooo bad . \nGreat to see Wolfowitz , my hero on Piers tonight . \nThe architect of the Gulf War is exactly what we need to figure out how to make this situation into America 's . \nIs there Oil in Egypt ? \nWhat can we get if we take over Egypt ? \nWe are much more mature to run other countries , I wish the World would all go American and I could use my money anywhere instead of changing my greenbacks for funny money if I travel -- still have to get a passport though . . \nMy hat is off to Mr. Piers Morgan for being able to take on the change in his shows ' formate to cover the Egypt situation . \nMr Morgan is articulate , caring -- poised under pressure while displaying conversational elegance and keen insight . \nHow refreshing and how important the information he hand caries into the wasteland of network `` reporting '' . \nMr Morgan delivers over and over again . \nThank you for your professionalism and your skill . \nKeep up your seemingly prescient reporting . \nThanks CNN for Mr. Morgan Why are we having this discussion with the neocon war criminal Wolfowitz ? \nIn my opinion , he is on the same low moral plane as Mubarak and his torturer ilk ! \nWolfowitz is not a credible commentator . \nPlease do not include him in the future . \nyou 're not funny nor amusing , you just do n't appreciaate a good reporting . . \nEven if u try alll your life , you will not reach the intelligence or the knowledge of Anderson Cooper . \nAs an average citizen , I am distressed that you have given Paul Wolfowitz a forum this evening . \nHe has been totally discredited several years ago and should not be commenting on Egypt . \nWe also need to be more careful as a people about pontificating on events in Egypt , that frankly , most Americans can not understand . \nMubarak is no saint . \nI just spent two weeks in Egypt . \nThe government does not provide basic services that we all take for granted . \nPlease , CNN , be more careful with your choice of so-called `` expert '' commentary . \nGuess you know nothing of Anderson Cooper . \nHe 's quite familiar with the Middle East , try reading his book . \nAnd he sure as heck has more courage than you do . \nnot only reading his books , Cooper is well educated and traveled the world . \nHe has more knowledge than all of us here , , , , surprisingly non of you guys take the effort bing and search before making any oppinion ????? Poorly run program with even poorer testimonies from burned and unreliable invitees . \nyou guys focus on how poorly run the program and forget the essence and main topic that people getting killed for raising their voices and demanding freedom and democracy ... Was unsure of Piers Morgan at first , but find that I enjoy his interviews very much , indeed Yes , he interrupts at times -- but he 's sure to get feedback on that and address it . \nI 'm impressed by his coverage of the situation in Egypt ; he 's certainly holding his own . \nLet us all listen and concentrate on the pain topic , , which is Egypt and how the current regime have been committing crimes against humanity ... ?? We are all concerned about people getting killed for raising their voices , not only in Egipt , but in other countries as well . \nAll tiranies have to step down , but that does n't justify a poorly run program , and even less the unreliable invitees that have been responsible of some of oiur dark history why do n't you at least spell Egypt correctly first , and stick with essence ... and pay attention , , , today the topic is Egypt , so when the topic is Armenia , we will discuss it then ???? What I can `` t understand is why the knee jerk reaction everytime something is `` supposed '' to happen !! You cancel advertised programs and run to Egypt to get what ? \nnone news !!! You get these experts on to tell us what they think will happen when they don `` t have a clue either . \nTo me they just make themselves look stupid . \nYou have Blitzer and Spitzer on for two hours before your shoe giving us `` news '' which is obviously incorrect and then you change your schedule to give us more of the same !! If you want to cover Egypt . \nWhy not take a few days to get some facts together and then give us a show with some genuine information instead of making space for a bunch of so called experts to fall over themselves with obvious missinformation and conjecture !! Good lord most of our opinions are probably just as accurate as the specialists you have on . \nCuz the evens in Egypt changing constantly , so here you have it ... CNN have stationed reporters for many years in Egypt and they live the truth ??? Agree . \nWhile the happenings in Egypt are newsworthy they 1 -RRB- forget there is other news happening in the world and 2 -RRB- nobody cares about what is going on at 4AM over there , which is nothing . \nThey have pre-empted the Firth interview 3 times to have us listen to a bunch of blowhards have a Q&A with Piers that amount to nothing but drivel . \niers has driven me from CNN . \nHe replaced L. King ok , lets give change a chance , he 's awful . \nI 've been with CNN for a long time , I resonate with AC 360 , and his panel of analysts ; however , Piers always interrupts , ALWAYS , his questions are delivered with arrogance , not engaging the viewer or the person he interviews . \nHoward Stern , the Hollywood scene , return AC 360 . \nI 'm switching to another station during Piers ' time slot . \nAmanpour is one of many who are salient , Piers does not fit this learned group . \nThe Egyptian consituiton has a line of succession ! \nWhen Nixon resigned he was not forced to leave the country so why is Murbarak required to leave Egypt ? \nNixon flew home to California . \nLet Mubarak go back to his home and become just another Egyptian citizen . \nYou are right , it is Egypt , and it was a typo error , but in all honesty , spelling does n't have anything to do with essence . \nAt least you know my last name , beause I do n't hide like others do . \nToday it is about Egypt . \nWhen it comes to Armenia or any other country , we can further discuss , but being unpolite will not help you support your position I do n't mind the error , but i was making a point for you and everyone in here to stick with topic and to stop talking about cosmatic things regarding the show and programming . \nWe should all to help anyone in need of freedom and democracy ... Avedik ... Could n't agree with you more ... as for Marc `` s comment ... he can `` t seem to help it !!! just read his previous statements on this page and notice his wonderful way with words !!! I refrain from pointing out his spelling in every blog !! I am too polite for that !!! As for you Marc ... making insulting remarks certainly doesn `` t help you cause . . \nmaking a small spelling eror is only a cosmetic fault no ? \nAlong with a constant call for violence as a result of protester 's anger , exacerbated by a firebrand Republican and , of all people , a prime reason for the Iraqi invasion Paul Wolfowitz , Morgan ca n't get beyond his opinion . \nPiers Morgan and Glenn Beck ! \nSorry Piers , but I still have n't gotten over your bestowal of respectability upon the uber-imperialist Wolfowitz . \nWhat other conquistadors can we expect as guest commentators ? \nWill we get to hear Henry Kissinger pontificate on peace and freedom ? \nIt 's a shame Dr. Strangelove is a fictional character -- he would be perfect for your show ! \nI apologize for the delayed reaction . \nI 've been glued to the set for the last hour watching the talking heads commenting as they watch nothing happening in Tahir Square . \nFebruary 10 , 2011 at 11:31 pm | Report abuse | Gonernments are the same all over the world-they all lie manipulate their own people-they all should step down I wonder-how many billions the Wall st. is going to make , thanks to this crisis in Egypt ? \nwatching crissis in egypt it seems to me that some cnn reporters does ' t understand what happen and theirs comment are not objective expecialy mr. anderson cooper \\ s , his comments are onesided in supporting protestors . \nBut it is complicated problem , which is simmilar which was 30 years ego in poland , and still polish people learn how is democracy . \nDemocracy and transition is not going happen day by day , it needs time and preparation . \nIn poland there was protestors and frustration , on the end governent make state of emergency , today over 50 % polish people are saying it was right , and prevent national disaster , which happen in hungary in 56 and czekoslovakia 68 . \n, Today in egypt situation is complicated and kind of simmilar but mentality of arabs world is different , who is going to take control over egypt , crowd from the squere , army , which can rule egypt for next 20 or 30 years or egypt may be religion state like in iran . \nIt is nessesary to understand that all governent agenda including army right now is mubarak 's , i do n't think that opposition is prepare to take over , right away , it is for sure , people of egypt want changes and they have right for it , but step down of mubarak nothing change now in rules of egyptian governent it may just calm down demonstrators , they probably accept army rules and others but they want to step down mubarak right away , what happen next nobody know . \nPeace and stabilization in the middle east is very important for rest of us . \nToday reporters and media have huge impact on opinion of the world and they can pervent increasing conflict if they understand many situations and sides in conflict , they are obective and they have imagination what could happen in many situations which could happen , i understand that they have their own opinions but reporters should be objective I have been so looking forward to the Colin Firth interview -- I can watch the Egyptian issue on the news all day long , I thought Piers Morgan was hosting an interview program ! \nI am deeply disappointed ! \nHey Piers Morgan , who gave you in charge the war criminals menagerie ? \nPlease do not bring them next time . \nYeah Piers you 're doing fine . \nDid I miss some coverage of Egypt though ... Is there no leader emerging from or leading this dusty democratic uprising ? \nI have n't heard him or her speak ... otherwise are n't they just a mob that should be dispersed with tear gas , rubber bullets or water canons ? \nMubarak said he would step down later this year after passing the reigns onto another government , what 's six more months for a peacful transition when it 's taken you this long to protest his rule . \nIf this uprising could produce a suitable person maybe it would be sooner . \nStep up to the plate . \nHad to laugh at AC crying about getting harrassed ... it 's not your country little man and no they do n't have to let you report . \ni find it amazing that the media prima donnas , like Christiana Amanpour , who attacked the Bush administration for not finding `` weapons of mass destruction '' in Iraq , because the intelligence was incorrect all over the world ... stand before us and blame the bad intelligence they received for them getting the EGYPT scenaria wrong night after night after night ! \nIf you think politicians wo n't admit when they are wrong -- just watch the media `` darlings . '' \nThey put politicians to shame . \nI LIKE THE SHOW , PIERS ! \nRelief !! Someone must have talked to Piers about his annoying and rude interruptions . \nI watched the entire show tonight for the first time without the urge to switch him off ... and without the urge to murmur `` boor ! '' \nunder my breath ... specifically because he refrained from constantly interrupting his guests . \nI 've been looking forward to the Firth interview as well , but since it was pre-recorded I hope it 's not another episode of `` Piers Morgan Interrupts ... '' Have you totally taken leave of your senses ? \nHow could you possibly have invited Paul Wolfowitz onto your show . \nHe was one of the ones who talked Bush into invading Iraq . \nHe 's a war criminal and should be in jail or at least be put on trail at the Hague . \nPay attention to whom you invite ... I 'm tired of hearing the same old BS again and again . \nI loved watching Mr Arslan on your show . \nHe knows what he is talking about . \nHis views represent the views of most muslims worldwide , who believe that we can have pluralism and democracy in the muslim coulntries with religion playing a role in these societies . . \nAt first , I was excited to see the interviews that Piers Morgan would bring to CNN after being a long time Larry King fan . \nBut I am very disappointed in his rude style AND because you can never tell when an interview will be shown . \nI have waited to see Colin Firth four times , only to see him bumped so they can show you another hour of the stuff from Egypt . \nCNN shows Egypt ALL DAY ... people need a break ! \nI was very happy to see Colin Firth on the Bravo channel on `` Inside The Actor 's Studio '' a couple of days ago and I am sure that interview is much better than Piers Morgan can do . \nI am finished with him ! \nThe only the that will get me to watch this show is when they finally do show the Colin Firth interview . \nAs you have pointed out , nothing is going on in Egypt at 4 a.m. , and anything that has happened has been rehashed ad infinitum by so-called experts who like to hear themselves talk . \nWatching the various journalists actually in Egypt , you can actually be amazed at how many different ways they can say the same thing which is essentially that they do n't know anything . \nI think it is insulting to Colin Firth -LRB- and Geoffrey Rush and Helena Bonham Carter -RRB- to keep pre-empting them and then to see what interviews do get through . \nGracious as they are , they will be understanding , but COME ON , FOLKS ! \nPiers is only marginally less annoying than Wolf or John King . \nTalking about the Middle East ? \nYou 've got to be kidding . \nYou 're either nuts , cynical or clueless . \nI think most people on her do n't have a clue . \nRember politicians do n't tell you everything and the press does not ether . \nWe need to stop believing everything we here on the news . \nThank God Mubarak stepped down . \nI am so happy for the Egyptian people and their freedom ! \nJust saw the Paul Wolfowitz interview . \nHow can you leave that sort of interview with Wolfowitz having the final word . \nI can tell that you have so much more to say . \nTake the risk and people will follow . \nJust take the risk . \nIt will pay off . \nPaul Wolfowitz is a war criminal who should be on trial right now , not allowed to be giving `` expert '' opinion . \n-LRB- Right now he 's on Fareed Zakaria 's show , sharing his Middle East wisdom with us yet again . -RRB- \nRemember , this is the man who claimed that the war in Iraq would cost us essentially nothing , being paid for by oil revenues . \nThe world has already suffered incalculably because this man 's advice was listened to . \nWe all should consider boycotting all CNN shows that feature him as an expert witness . \n-LRB- required , but will not be displayed -RRB- CNN welcomes a lively and courteous discussion as long as you follow the Rules of Conduct set forth in our Terms of Service . \nComments are not pre-screened before they post . \nYou agree that anything you post may be used , along with your name and profile picture , in accordance with our Privacy Policy and the license you have granted pursuant to our Terms of Service . \nNotify me of follow-up comments via email . \nEverything from #Paterno to #Rihanna , Melissa McCarthy to the Pope , plus #OBL 's shooter & #GunsinAmerica . \n@DonnyDeutsch is on it ! \n9p #CNN 8:13 pm ET February 11 , 2013 RETWEET Will the 4th time be a charm ? \nProbably , just like the 1st , 2nd , and 3rd . \nRT @reallorraine Thanks @piersmorgan and Life Stories team & brilliant audience - made me feel very relaxed and happy ! \n"}
{"id": "236", "time": "2011-02-10", "text": "2 men charged in death of Chicago teen who performed in inauguration event . \nCNN 's Fareed Zakaria says this move by Mubarak may be just trying to bait the protestors into more violence . \nWatch more about what this might mean and read an edited transcript from Zakaria : `` One hopes that history does not mark this as the moment that this revolution turned . \nFor two weeks the demonstrators have been peaceful , they have been entirely democratic and incredibly honorable . \nBut they 've been broken up , they have been beaten ; the regime has tried to divide the opposition , it has tried to make phony concessions . \nThe one thing the regime did not do is concede to the principal demand . \nThe danger here is that things will get radicalized . \n... The opposition , the protesters , the crowds are going to get angrier and angrier . \nThey 're going to draw perhaps more violent people . \nThat is , in a sense , what the regime is hoping for . \nIn a strange sense , I think the Mubarak regime is trying to bait the crowd in Tahrir Square and is hoping for violence and is hoping for some kind of march on the presidential palace that seems to get violent . \nThen they can step in and in the guise of restoring order , return to the military rule , return to the martial law that they want to consolidate . \nThat 's the danger here . \nThis might be a turn that history will record as the moment things went awry . '' \nAfter Vice President Omar Suleiman 's speech , Zakaria said the move discredited Suleiman as any kind of transitional figure : `` Egypt is a very nationalist country with a very proud people . \nIt has a 7,000-year-old history , as President Mubarak pointed out -LRB- in his speech -RRB- . \nBut I do n't think it 's going to work . \nWhat you just witnessed is Omar Suleiman discrediting himself as any kind of transitional figure . \nOmar Suleiman , the vice president , could have been the man who ushered in a new Egypt . \nHe would n't have lasted but he would have been the man who brokered it all . \nBut he has decided to stick with his boss . \n... Suleiman is a former general , former head of military intelligence and President Mubarak 's consigliere . \n... The regime is hoping that it can wait out these protestors . \nBut I think the big mistake for the last two weeks that the regime has made is that it has kept assuming that these people are going to go home . \nAnd they do n't go home - the crowds just keep getting bigger and bigger and stronger and stronger . \nFriday will be a very crucial day because my guess is that you 'll see the largest protest you 've ever seen in Egypt . '' \nHave to agree with Zakaria . \nThe minute Mubarek came out with `` as a father to his children '' I cringed and knew he had no intention whatsover of stepping down . \nDid n't even have to listen to the rest of the speech . \nHighly inflammatory at the least if not outright insulting to the protesters , imo . \nI 'd like to see any US President address fellow citizens as `` children . '' \nPresident Obama , CNN , and Anderson Cooper have this Egypt uprising dead wrong - 100 % wrong . \nObama and CNN would have you believe that a President should just step down when 100,000 or even 1 milllion protestors take to the streets and demand he resign . \nThat is not Democracy -- that is Anarchy and Obama and CNN are fueling the flames by going public and telling folks that Mubarack must begin to `` transition '' out now . \nDUMB Try this on for size Mr President - will you step down and begin to `` transition '' out if 1 million angry protestors stand outside the White House and demand you resign ? \nI mean 80 % of the Americans living here did not vote for you sir . \nMore than half of the voters do not support you and think this country -- the good ole USA -- is heading in the wrong direction under your stewarship . \nWky not Go Away - Game Over - I mean , what is good for Egypt must be good for the US - when the people revolt and protest outside the White House -- you should resign Mr Obama . \nSuch is the absurdity of thei White House and CNN -- both get caught up in the frenzy and can not see the forest from the trees . \nIf Obama wishes to support what is happening in Egypt , he needs to prepare for anarchy in the streets of every Mid East nation - and to expect nothing more here at home . \nGive it a rest CNN . \nStop talking about it Mr President . \nit is not our place to dictate how other countries conduct their affairs -- and it is inflamatory and dangerous for US Presidents to be giving unwanted advice to foreign leaders , As for CNN , take Anderson Cooper off the story and give him a 2 month vacation with pay . \nHe has lost all sense of objectivity and is just personally hurt he got beat up - something he and others deserved for going over their to falem the emotions of protestors . \nWe have enough trouble at home Anderson - if you want to attack something big and ugly and out of control and hurting millions - report on the US economy , the deficit , the foreclosures , and the unemployed , and turn your anger and your cameras to Washington and the reaon source of the problems we face . \nWhere are you people when the repugs are destroying , not figuratively , literally destroying the country ? \nOh that 's right , the right can never take responsibility for their actions . \nThat 's the hallmark of the whole childish , undereducated bunch . \nI doubt it , but have you read enough to know that this is a dictator who has held sham elections for decades ? \nFebruary 11 , 2011 at 9:30 am | Report abuse | It 's not like I 'm loyal to Obama . \nI leave the personal stuff to the drama queens on the right . \nIt 's just that you watch the country being destroyed and then complain about the recovery not happening fast enough . \nThe slow upswing is bad enough . \nI 'm literally worried the rabble on the right are going to put the country back on the same downswing they did before they were booted out . \nFebruary 11 , 2011 at 9:34 am | Report abuse | 80 % of Americans in US did n't vote for Obama ? \nMubarak has been a dictator for 40 years and become the richest man in the world while his country stumbles through abject poverty . . \nObama an elected official for 2 years in a democratic country of 400 million , as opposed to 75 million in Egypt . \nEvery President of the US pushes for democracy in dictatorships -LRB- partially because we generally put the dictatorship in power and hold some responsibility and it 's decades later and embarrassing . -RRB- \nYou should try reading and thinking and not let radical media hand you your opinions . \nFebruary 11 , 2011 at 10:33 am | Report abuse | this is where the cia needs to step up and field work the area and sift for Al Queida . . \nim sure Al Queida is heading there right now . \nto try and seed the population . \nIn a democratic system people cast their vote at the poles . \nIn a corrupted system people cast their votes in a huge protest . \nPower to the Egyptian people ! \nWith over $ 70 Billion in Swiss Banks , Mubarak will soon leave Egypt . \nCurrently , he is having trouble landing in another country . \nSo far , his only hope is Iran or North Korea , both too cold in winter months . \nHis second problem , keeping the courts from freezing his money . \nHe would have left last night , however he needs a place to land . \nI just pray this does n't turn out to be another Tienmen Suare . \nAnyone see how closely this resembles the Romanian revolution of 1989 ? \nMubarak might want to consider how that turned out for Ceaucescu ...

'' \nMoody 's said that Jordanian protesters `` could use the regional uprisings as an opportunity to express their discontent about high unemployment and the lack of development for low-income groups . '' \nStandard & Poor 's , another major credit rating agency , made a similar move . \nJordanian officials are not happy with the downgrade , arguing that their public finances are sound -- Jordan 's foreign currency reserves actually rose last year and stand at about $ 12 billion -- and that the economy may grow as much as 6 % in 2011 . \nProtests there have been largely peaceful and far smaller than in Egypt and Tunisia . \nBut after pledging to cut the budget deficit , the government reversed course in January with a package of subsidies and salary increases amounting to some $ 600 million , to compensate for higher prices . \nInternational bond markets are wary that governments may try to `` buy their way '' out of trouble , in the words of one analyst . \nIt is a potentially toxic cycle , according to regional economists . \nEgypt and Tunisia have already suffered a loss of tourism revenue in peak season , while record-high grain prices and a surge in the price of crude oil have fueled inflation . \nJordan imports 90 per cent of its oil , and faces disruption to its gas supplies after an explosion at a pipeline in Egypt last week . \nLike Jordan , Egypt has opted to spend more on subsidies for the poor . \nThe recent street protests , now in their third week , have led stores , businesses , the stock market and banks to close -- a further cost . \nUntil the protests erupted , Egypt had a positive reputation in the international debt markets -- with attractive interest rates for investors , banks that had avoided high-risk investments , a manageable budget deficit and low overall sovereign debt . \nLike Jordan , it was working to cut its budget deficit . \nBut markets abhor uncertainty and the government 's cost of borrowing has risen sharply since the protest movement erupted -- although it has fallen back slightly in recent days . \nEarlier this week , the Egyptian Central Bank intervened to support the pound against the dollar , spending precious foreign currency in the process . \nAnd before the Egyptian stock market closed , some $ 5 billion was wiped off the value of Egyptian stocks in just two days . \nIn addition , government wages and pensions in Egypt have been increased 15 per cent . \nCredit strategists say any labor unrest -- especially at the Suez Canal where a strike began among service workers Wednesday -- would put Egypt 's finances under further pressure . \nShipping has so far been unaffected by the labor action . \nMarket commentators say that international investors are already avoiding Egyptian Treasury auctions -- another is due next week -- meaning local banks are expected to pick up the slack . \nOne former Jordanian official told CNN that he hoped the country 's vulnerable economic state and its value to the United States as a reliable pro-Western ally would prompt greater financial support from Washington . \nLast year , foreign grants -- mainly from the United States and Saudi Arabia -- totaled more than $ 400 million . \nBut there is pressure on the U.S. federal budget too . \n"}
{"id": "70", "time": "2011-02-10", "text": "Egyptian Ambassador to the U.S. Sameh Shoukry spoke with CNN s Wolf Blitzer to clarify the current roles of Egypt s Hosni Mubarak and Omar Suleiman . \nThis interview aired in the 5 p.m. ET hour of The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer . \nA full transcript is after the jump . \nFULL TRANSCRIPT : Please credit all usage of the interview to CNN s The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer THIS IS A RUSH FDCH TRANSCRIPT . \nWOLF BLITZER , HOST : Stand by , because joining us now is the Egyptian Ambassador to the United States . \nAmbassador Shoukry , thanks very much for joining us . \nYou can see the frustration . \nYou can see the anger on the streets of - around Tahrir Square right now . \nThese protesters are furious that they did n't hear what they were led to believe they would hear , that the Egyptian president , Hosni Mubarak , would step down . \nGive us your reaction . \nSAMEH SHOUKRY , EGYPTIAN AMBASSADOR TO U.S. : Mr. Blitzer , I 'm calling in just as a matter of objectivity , to convey to you my sense of maybe some confusion on your part in terms of what exactly the president did say . \nThe president did say , indicate very clearly , that he was transferring all his presidential authority to the vice president . \nHe had done so after he had referred to the parliament the constitutional amendments upon which the political reform would proceed . \nSo that was a point while I was following your program that I felt needed clarification . \nBLITZER : Well , are you saying , Ambassador - and excuse me for interrupting - that President Mubarak is no longer the president of Egypt ? \nSHOUKRY : President Mubarak has transferred the powers of the presidency to his vice president , who now undertakes all authorities as president . \nSo we can say that the president is a de jure president , and no longer -- the vice president is the de facto president . \nBLITZER : So Omar Suleiman , you 're saying , is now the president of Egypt and Hosni Mubarak is no longer the president of Egypt ? \nIs that what I hear you saying , Ambassador ? \nSHOUKRY : This is a constitutional issue , Mr. Blitzer , which needs to be addressed from a very specific legal , constitutional perspective , not from a perspective of any form of spin . \nThe president has transferred his authority under Article 82 of the constitution to the vice president to undertake all presidential authority that is incorporated in the constitution . \nSo , currently , the presidential powers are all bestowed in the person of the vice president . \nBLITZER : All right . \nSo I just want to be precise . \nAnd this is the information you 're getting from the Foreign Ministry , from your government in Cairo right now ? \nSHOUKRY : Mr. Blitzer , I am getting this from the vice president . \nBLITZER : From Omar Suleiman , that he is now the de facto president , if not the de jure president . \nHe 's the acting president of Egypt . \nIs that fair to say that ? \nSHOUKRY : He is now undertaking all authority of the presidency under the constitution . \nBLITZER : Does President Mubarak have any authority left ? \nSHOUKRY : President Mubarak has transferred all authority to the vice president . \nBLITZER : All authority . \nSo he has no authority left ? \nSHOUKRY : The only three issues that the vice president can not make any determination on are making amendments to the constitution or dissolving parliament or firing the cabinet . \nBLITZER : Who can make those decisions ? \nSHOUKRY : Those are decisions that would be made only by the president . \nIn this case , those decisions are not effective , because the president has transferred all power to the vice president . \nBLITZER : All right . \nSo , just to be precise , President Mubarak still retains those powers , those three powers . \nThe constitution retains those powers , and they are not any longer bestowed with anyone . \nBLITZER : Well , so who dismisses parliament if necessary ? \nBLITZER : So is it fair to say that President Mubarak now has no power ? \nSHOUKRY : That is certainly an interpretation you can make . \nBLITZER : So President Mubarak now has no longer any powers . \nHe 's no longer head of state ? \nSHOUKRY : He remains the de jure head of state . \nBLITZER : Does he also remain commander of the military ? \nSHOUKRY : He has transferred all powers under the constitution to the vice president , so he has transferred all effective powers to the vice president under the constitution . \nBLITZER : And can he get those powers back ? \nOr is that irrevocable ? \nSHOUKRY : That 's a very technical constitutional issue that I 'm unable to speak to without referring again very specifically to the legal terms of the constitution . \nBLITZER : So we do n't know if he can demand those powers back from Vice President Suleiman ? \nSHOUKRY : I do n't think that is the issue currently , Mr. Blitzer . \nI think the -- BLITZER : Well , no. . \nI want to be precise , and you 're helping us better appreciate the nuances here . \nRemember , we were working off a translation , an English translation . \nBut you heard , and you see the reaction of the crowd over there in Tahrir . \nSHOUKRY : I 've heard the speech , and I have in my hand the copy of the speech . \nBLITZER : So the hundreds of thousands of people who were in Tahrir Square , they all left angry , furious . \nThey did n't appreciate , I guess , the nuances of what you 're telling us . \nSHOUKRY : I 'm not in Tahrir Square , so I ca n't really judge , Mr. Blitzer . \nBLITZER : Will President Mubarak stay in Egypt , or is he getting ready to leave ? \nSHOUKRY : I have no information regarding that issue . \nBLITZER : And as far as you know , he 's in Egypt right now though . \nAs far as I know , he is in Egypt . \nBLITZER : Why could n't he just say in simple terms what Leon Panetta , the CIA director , seemed to suggest he would say earlier in the day , or what - at least the impression we got from the president of the United States , President Obama , this was an historic moment and that he was stepping down ? \nWhy could n't he simply say it bluntly so that we do n't have to read in between the lines ? \nSHOUKRY : I really ca n't answer that question . \nThat 's a question only the president can answer . \nI think all I can comment on is that , apparently , this process has been undertaken with a desire to maintain the legitimacy of the constitutional process . \nBLITZER : And so is the vice president , Omar Suleiman , who you now say is the de facto president , is he in charge of the military ? \nSHOUKRY : He would be in charge of the military , because all have - all authority has been transmitted to him . \nBLITZER : All authority , even though in our official translation - in our translation - he said he was delegating power ? \nThat was from the Arabic into the English , delegating power to the vice president . \nHe did n't include -- SHOUKRY : What he said is that he was delegating the powers of the presidency to the vice president . \nBLITZER : Yes , we did n't have - our Arabic speakers say that their translation did n't mean he was delegating the power , all the power , or some of the power , it was a more ambiguous delegating power to the vice president . \nDo you remember in Arabic precisely how he phrased it ? \nSHOUKRY : As I recall , he said that he has delegated the authority of the presidency to the vice president . \nBLITZER : And is this just your interpretation , Mr. Ambassador ? \nBecause I know you , and I know you 're an honorable man , and you 're a good civil servant of Egypt , an excellent representative here in Washington . \nIs this your interpretation , or is the instructions , the guidance you have been given by your government ? \nSHOUKRY : I felt that I needed to clarify this issue . \nThis issue has been clarified to me that this is the intention . \nI am transmitting it to you for the sake of objectivity . \nBLITZER : And you 've transmitted the same information to the U.S. government ? \nSHOUKRY : I certainly intend to . \nBLITZER : You plan on speaking to somebody from the Obama administration , from the State Department ? \nSHOUKRY : There is a constant dialogue between us . \nBLITZER : So let 's just recap right now , because I 'm grateful to you for being precise . \nWho is the head of state of Egypt right now ? \nSHOUKRY : The head of state of Egypt is the president , who has transmitted all his powers to the vice president . \nBLITZER : All right . \nSo just to be precise , the head of state is still Hosni Mubarak ? \nSHOUKRY : The de jure head of state is Hosni Mubarak . \nThe de facto head of state is Omar Suleiman . \nBLITZER : And de jure means the legal head of state , the official head of state . \nBut the de fact meaning , for all practical purposes , you 're saying Suleiman is the president . \nSHOUKRY : For undertaking all decisions , responsibilities under the Constitution , it 's Vice President Omar Suleiman . \nBLITZER : He 's in charge , for all practical purposes , right now ? \nSHOUKRY : For all presidential authority that is stipulated in the constitution . \nBLITZER : And put on your hat as an observer , as an Egyptian , a proud Egyptian , someone who has watched this . \nAnd you and I have spoken several times . \nPut on your hat as someone who understands the mood of Egypt right now . \nWill this be acceptable to the protesters , that Suleiman , the vice president , in effect , becomes president ? \nSHOUKRY : I would n't speak on anyone 's behalf . \nI think that remains to be seen . \nAnd whatever the demonstrators indicate will certainly be a matter of great concern to everyone . \nI think the demonstrators , the right to demonstrate , their right to participate in the political life of Egypt and to follow the reform process that is under way , and to form the roadmap to the future has been recognized by everyone . \nBLITZER : And this roadmap , to be precise , this transitional process , your understanding is it continues until September , when the next scheduled elections are supposed to take place ? \nSHOUKRY : It continues in the areas that have been defined , the constitutional reforms , and the consensus that emanated from the dialogue in terms of freedom of expression , of following up on issues of corruption , and the possibility of suspending the emergency law when security conditions are more conducive so there is a number of reforms that are under way so as to guarantee a meaningful and peaceful transition of power and authority in Egypt . \nBLITZER : Do you understand why Leon Panetta earlier in the day told Congress that he had been told that the Egyptian president , Hosni Mubarak , was going to step down as early as tonight ? \nSHOUKRY : I have no idea . \nI was not in communications with Mr. Panetta . \nBLITZER : I think in part because a top Egyptian military commander , an army commander , went into Tahrir Square earlier in the day and told the protesters , `` All of your demands will be fully met . '' \nThey interpreted that as meaning - and they were screaming with joy , they were dancing , they were singing - that Mubarak would go away , would step down as president . \nAnd so what I hear you saying , Mr. Ambassador , is that he has stepped down as president , even though he technically , legally still may be the head of state . \nSHOUKRY : I can only reiterate what I said , Mr. Blitzer . \nHe has transferred all powers to the vice president . \nBLITZER : All powers to the vice president , except the ability to dissolve parliament . \nSHOUKRY : Which now is in the hands of no one . \nBLITZER : Which is in the hands of no one . \nWhat about the ability to end the state of emergency , which has been around since 1981 ? \nWho can end that ? \nSHOUKRY : That of course is the authority of the de facto president . \nBLITZER : So , in other words , if Omar Suleiman wanted to end the state of emergency tomorrow , he could just sign a piece of paper and that would end it ? \nSHOUKRY : He has all the authorities under the constitution to act on any matter . \nBLITZER : Do you have any indication he will end the state of emergency ? \nSHOUKRY : There were references in both the president 's and vice president 's speeches tonight that the reform process is under way . \nBLITZER : That they were thinking about doing it , but he made no commitment , no pledge to do so . \nSHOUKRY : They made a reference to the political dialogue on the way , and among it , the issue of lifting the emergency law under the appropriate security conditions . \nAnd just to be precise - because I know you 've been very helpful to us , and I 'm grateful to you , Mr. Ambassador , for doing this - if Mubarak decides tomorrow , or a month from now , or six months from now to take back the power from Suleiman , the vice president , can he ? \nSHOUKRY : I really do not have the information . \nAgain , these are legalistic issues . \nI do n't have the article of the constitution that relates to these issues . \nBLITZER : What are you bracing for tomorrow , Friday ? \nIt 's already Friday in Egypt . \nIt 's approaching 1:00 a.m. now in Egypt . \nIt 's a day of prayer , but all the anticipation is that after the midday prayers , hundreds of thousands , if not millions , of people will go out and protest . \nHow worried are you , Mr. Ambassador , that this could get ugly ? \nSHOUKRY : There is a - I think it 's been declared on several occasions at the highest level that the Egyptian people have the right to demonstrate and express their opinions under the protection of the government and the protection of the military , and I 'm sure the Egyptian people will undertake their responsibilities to express their opinions in a peaceful manner , and the voice of the people has been heard and the voice of the people will continue to guide the reform process . \nBLITZER : Do you feel that the U.S. administration , the Obama administration , as the foreign minister of Egypt said in an interview with PBS this week , your foreign minister , that the U.S. administration is improperly interfering in domestic Egyptian affairs ? \nSHOUKRY : I 'm sorry . \nMy position here as ambassador necessitates that I maintain the channels of cooperation and consultation , and this is our interest , to maintain our special and strong relationship to the United States . \nThe U.S.-Egyptian partnership is an enduring one , one that is important to both sides . \nBLITZER : Have you been asked to convey any disappointment , any displeasure or anger to the U.S. government on behalf of your government on some statements that may have been made by American officials ? \nSHOUKRY : No , not at all . \nBLITZER : So , in your contacts with U.S. officials , you 've been basically saying the U.S. and Egypt have a good relationship , have always had a good relationship , let 's continue that good relationship ? \nSHOUKRY : It is right . \nWe are constantly in contact , and the dialogue is one of partnership , cooperation , and mutual understanding . \nBLITZER : And what 's the message they have given you , the State Department ? \nSHOUKRY : It is a reiteration of the same message that the president has conveyed on several occasions , that this is an Egyptian process , and the United States is supportive of a reform process , and is supportive of a peaceful and meaningful transition of power in Egypt . \nBLITZER : All right . \nMr. Ambassador , if you can have a few more moments , Hala Gorani is with us as well . \nSHOUKRY : I am very sorry , but I do have other obligations , Mr. Blitzer . \nBLITZER : Oh , you do ?

'' \nLast week : President Ali Abdullah Saleh had said he would not seek re-election and would not pass power to his son , but it was n't enough for thousands of anti-government protesters who gathered near Sanaa University in the nation 's capital . \nThey spoke out against poverty and demanded that Saleh , whose term ends in 2013 , step down . \nSaleh said he has requested his party to freeze debate on a constitutional amendment to end term limits until a consensus is reached . \nA Facebook page dubbed `` Syrian Revolution 2011 '' attracted 15,000 friends in a week , Time magazine reported . \nLike other regimes in the region , Syria faces political alienation , economic dislocation and corruption , but because it has been the subject of international sanctions , it is beholden to no Western powers . \nThis separates Syria from places such as Egypt and Tunisia , analysts told the magazine . \nAccording to Human Rights Watch , security services have beaten and detained protesters . \nA candlelight vigil in old Damascus for the Egyptian protesters was broken up by people in civilian clothing , and police nearby failed to intervene . \nWhen one of the vigil 's organizers went to police , she was slapped and called a `` germ , '' the watchdog group said . \nLast week : After seeing unrest in the region , President Bashar al-Assad said he would push for political reforms in his own country because waiting for protests like those in Egypt and Tunisia might make it `` too late to do any reform . '' \nReform activists used Facebook to call for demonstrations in Damascus , Aleppo and other cities , but it was unclear how many people would turn out . \nBy all accounts a police state , Syria has been ruled by President Bashar al-Assad for more than 10 years . \nBefore him , his father , Hafez al-Assad ruled the country for almost three decades . \nA transitional government is overseeing sweeping changes after massive demonstrations forced out the country 's longtime president . \nInternet filters have disappeared and there is unfettered access to websites . \nJournalists are learning how to create a free press and are transforming their newspapers , radio broadcasts and television stations . \nReforms are taking place in every region of the country , and people are expressing their opinions openly in the streets , something that did n't happen under President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali . \nStill , small incidents disrupt daily activity . \nThe incidents are widely believed to be perpetrated by people who once worked for Ben Ali 's secret police and are aiming to destabilize the transitional government . \nLast week : The north African nation charged Ben Ali , as well as his wife and several relatives , with maintaining and exporting foreign currency illegally , carrying weapons and ammunition without licenses and inciting armed violence among Tunisians . \nWhen will the violence end ? \nExclusive with Yemeni Prime Minister Children of the Egyptian revolution Self-made billionaire as new Lebanese PM The ex-leader fled to Saudi Arabia last month after mass protests that left more than 100 people dead . \nProtests there began when demonstrators -- credited with starting the ripple effect of protests across North Africa and the Middle East -- lashed out at poor living conditions , high unemployment , government corruption and repression . \nFinal results of last month 's referendum show that the southern Sudanese voted almost 99 to 1 to split from the north , leading to what will be the world 's newest nation in July . \nAn election official said the vote was peaceful and transparent and `` not a single person showed up to appeal the results . '' \nDespite the vote 's smoothness , violence erupted on the north-south border when Sudanese soldiers loyal to Gabriel Tang , a southern Sudanese militia leader who fought in a 22-year-old civil war alongside the Khartoum government , refused to turn in their weapons . \nFifty people were killed in fighting . \nLast week : Already faced with the expected secession of its oil-rich south and charges of genocide against President Omar al-Bashir , Sudan 's government began seeing signs of unrest . \nPolice clashed with students in the capital Khartoum on Sunday as the protesters chanted , `` Tunisia , Egypt , Sudan together as one . '' \nAbout 100 students hurled rocks at police officers , who pushed them back . \nThe human rights group Amnesty International said more than 20 people still being held by police `` are at risk of torture or other ill-treatment . '' \nObservers say that if the country does n't find a suitable end to its political turmoil , it could become a battleground between Iran and Syria on one side and pro-Western forces on the other . \nAttempts to form a new government have been complicated by a U.N. tribunal probing the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri . \nThe tribunal is expected to implicate members of Hezbollah in the killing , which led the group to drop out of the government last month . \nLast week : Protests erupted in January as President Michel Suleiman appointed Najib Mikati , a Hezbollah-backed politician , as prime minister . \nHariri initially urged supporters to stage a `` day of rage '' and show restraint in protesting the appointment , but the demonstrations quickly grew ugly as gunshots were fired and his supporters burned tires and garbage containers in various cities . \nIn addition to a promise to lift a state of emergency , the government also cut taxes on sugar and cooking oil and increased the supply of wheat , Time magazine reports . \nThe moves come after weeks of protests . \nThe Algerian Press Service has reported that the government is also taking measures to bolster youth employment . \nSaad Djebbar , a London-based Algerian lawyer and political analyst , said he is skeptical . \n`` They want to produce some sort of trick that would show that reform is under way , like what Mubarak is doing in Egypt , who appears to be using all of the tricks in the book to avoid being removed , '' he said . \nLast week : Responding to unrest in the region , President Abdelaziz Bouteflika said he would lift the state of emergency in effect for nearly 20 years , according to the Algerian Press Service . \nLast month , the country 's largest opposition party called for demonstrations demanding the release of detainees and the restoration of individual and collective freedoms . \nOpponents blame the government for a spike in food prices and say the regime has failed to use Algeria 's vast energy wealth to better the lives of ordinary people . \nCNN 's Eliott C.

'' \n-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Wael Ghonim is a symbol of the revolution in Egypt . \nDuring his highly emotive interview on a popular Egyptian show Monday night , he went out of his way to rebut the accusations made by the older generation of Mubarak 's supporters that the protesters were `` traitors to Egypt '' and `` foreign agents . '' \nThese accusations were not only repeated on state media , but when Ghonim was arrested on January 28 and spent 12 nights in a Cairo prison , his fellow inmates accused him of the worst possible cultural and political trait for an Arab : khiyanah , or betrayal . \nWith foreign media presence and international support for the protesters , that accusation of treachery to Egypt and foreign involvement was gaining credence in many quarters in Egypt last week . \nMorale was slowly dropping . \nThen came Ghonim 's explosive interview Monday night . \nWith one stroke , he galvanized an entire generation of Egyptians . \nHis story is sincere and selfless : The regime 's treatment of him was why millions opposed the Mubarak government . \nIf Egyptians had forgotten , Ghonim 's plight reminded them . \nWith passion and intellectual clarity , he asked why he was arrested . \nWhy were his frail parents not informed ? \nHis parents had wandered from hospital to hospital crying -- why had n't police simply told them that he was in prison , and not dead ? \nThe face of Egypt 's revolution Ghonim : ` I 'm ready to die ' Ghonim : Welcome to Egypt revolution 2.0 Ghonim : ` No longer ' time to negotiate The widespread culture of democracy activists disappearing -- or worse , being tortured and killed -- had inspired Ghonim to create a Facebook page in memory of Khalid Said , who was beaten to death by police . \nThat page was instrumental in mobilizing a younger generation of Arabs to the January 25 protest meetings . \nGhonim 's interview was cataclysmic because he was candid : He has a job abroad in the Emirates , he lives comfortably in a villa , and he has nothing personal to gain from the dangers he and his wealthy friends put themselves in . \nTheir sacrifice was for the country and people they loved : Egypt and Egyptians . \nThis was not treachery , but sacrifice . \nGhonim 's clarity provided an emotional uplift to the protesters and their supporters . \nHe spoke about the dreams of ordinary Egyptians to live in freedom , and he struck a popular chord when he divulged that for 12 nights in prison , he sang '' Dream with Me , '' a popular Egyptian song by Hamza Namireh , another young Arab of the revolution who , eyewitnesses tell me , has been singing in Tahrir Square this week . \nWhere others would have relished the media attention , Ghonim 's piety and modesty shone as he paid tribute to the martyrs and heroes who were on the cold streets night after night . \nHe had slept in prison , he said , and so he was not a hero . \nIt is these sentiments and experiences -- the ability to dream and sing in adversity -- that resonate today in Egypt . \nGhonim exemplifies an entire generation of patriotic , educated young Egyptians . \nBut for all his strengths , he is not likely to become Egypt 's next president , a demand made by his many followers on a 200,000-strong Facebook page . \nRevolutions do not produce certainty . \nThe short term in Egypt will be unpredictable , and the successor to Mubarak is unknown . \nIt would be wrong for us in the West to express preferences , or groom leaders . \nThe last two weeks of protests in Egypt have been organic , and led by a coalition of people from tattooed freedom lovers to government-trained clerics . \nThis broad alliance will produce its own leaders when the country goes to the polls in September . \nIn a true democracy , the result of the ballot is unknown until the papers are counted . \nGhonim and his supporters want that free and democratic Egypt . \nGhonim may wish to be a candidate , or he may not . \nBut it is too soon to want to centralize a mass movement by imposing a figurehead on what is a broad coalition . \nThis is an Egyptian uprising , so let Egypt decide its fate through free and fair elections . \nThe opinions expressed in the commentary are solely those of Ed Husain . \n"}
{"id": "50", "time": "2011-02-10", "text": "After a tumultuous day of speculation , disappointment and then anger , Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak remains the titular head of his country . \n`` So I thought I would delegate powers to the vice president , according to the constitution , stipulations of the constitution , '' Mubarak said during his national televised address Thursday night . \nThe vice president is former intelligence head Omar Suleiman , tapped for the spot early in Mubarak 's response to the protests . \nThe Egyptian constitution allows the president to delegate powers to the vice president , a provision originally put into the document in case the president is temporarily incapacitated . \nThe constitution reserves three particular powers for the president alone -- they can not be delegated to the vice president . \nThose are the right to dismiss parliament , to request constitutional amendments and to alter the structure of the government . \nEgypt 's ambassador to the United States , Sameh Shoukry , said that while Mubarak was by law still the president , Suleiman was now `` the de facto president . '' \nSuleiman has already begun negotiations with some of Egypt 's opposition , and Mubarak said he 's already asked for the modification of five constitutional articles -- 76 , 77 , 88 , 93 and 198 -- and the repeal of a sixth -- 179 . \nArticles 76 and 77 deal with how presidential elections are conducted . \nArticle 76 sets standards for qualifying parties , which currently all but guarantee the ruling NDP a spot on the ballot , while 77 sets presidential terms at 6 years with no limits on re-election . \nArticles 88 and 93 deal with how members of parliament will be elected . \nArticle 88 in particular requires judges to oversee the elections . \nThose changes , if implemented , would answer demands to open Egyptian elections to more opposition candidates and loosen the grip of Mubarak 's party on power . \nArticle 198 allows the president to issue decrees with the force of law `` in exceptional cases '' as OK 'd by two-thirds of parliament -- essentially a codification of emergency power , but it sets a limited period of time for that power . \nAnd article 179 , which Mubarak proposed repealing altogether , allows the president to send anyone suspected of involvement in terrorism to a military court . \nMubarak and Suleiman both pledged to continue this work -- but perhaps the real question about what comes next in Egypt can only be answered by the `` youth movement '' that launched the protests more than two weeks ago -- and the military 's response . \n"}

'' \nShe continued : `` These heroes in Tahrir Square , they gave us back our humanity and gave us back our pride to go out and say no more . '' \nSara Ibrahim , a 28-year-old mother of two , took her three-year-old and one-month old sons to Thursday 's protests in London , hoping they would witness history . \n`` It means a lot to us , '' Ibrahim said . \n`` Even if I take a picture -LRB- of my son -RRB- and show him when he 's older , he can see he was part of history , creating history . \nHe will probably be taught about the Egyptian revolution , like people talk about the French Revolution , at school or college .

'' \nFollowing is the text of a statement released Thursday night by U.S. President Barack Obama on Egypt : `` The Egyptian people have been told that there was a transition of authority , but it is not yet clear that this transition is immediate , meaningful or sufficient . \nToo many Egyptians remain unconvinced that the government is serious about a genuine transition to democracy , and it is the responsibility of the government to speak clearly to the Egyptian people and the world . \nThe Egyptian government must put forward a credible , concrete and unequivocal path toward genuine democracy , and they have not yet seized that opportunity . \n`` As we have said from the beginning of this unrest , the future of Egypt will be determined by the Egyptian people . \nBut the United States has also been clear that we stand for a set of core principles . \nWe believe that the universal rights of the Egyptian people must be respected , and their aspirations must be met . \nWe believe that this transition must immediately demonstrate irreversible political change , and a negotiated path to democracy . \nTo that end , we believe that the emergency law should be lifted . \nWe believe that meaningful negotiations with the broad opposition and Egyptian civil society should address the key questions confronting Egypt 's future : protecting the fundamental rights of all citizens ; revising the Constitution and other laws to demonstrate irreversible change ; and jointly developing a clear roadmap to elections that are free and fair . \nThe five most popular stories on CNN.com in the past 24 hours , according to NewsPulse : Mubarak 's speech enrages protesters : Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak clung to his office but said he would `` delegate powers '' to Vice President Omar Suleiman according to the constitution - a major concession from the man who has ruled Egypt with an iron grip for 30 years . \nHis speech , however , enraged protesters in Tahrir Square , who want Mubarak to leave now . \n5 dead after homes leveled in Pennsylvania blast : The death toll in a suspected natural gas explosion that destroyed eight homes in Allentown , Pennsylvania , rose to five Thursday evening , authorities said . \nThe victims include a 4-month-old and a 79-year-old . \nFew customers line up for Verizon 's iPhone : After years of anticipation , relatively few people waited in line Thursday morning to buy the new Verizon Wireless iPhone 4 , according to anecdotal reports . \nMan claims to be father of South Carolina baby left in toilet : A man who claims he is the father of a baby found in a South Carolina toilet said he doubts the explanations about why the recently arrested mother left the newborn in a commode . \nHouse member resigns over ` profound mistakes ' : Republican Rep. Christopher Lee of New York resigned his House seat Wednesday after a report that the married congressman had tried to meet a woman on Craigslist . \nArizona Gov. Jan Brewer says she has `` no other choice '' than to sue the federal government for what she calls Washington 's failure to secure her state 's border and enforce immigration laws . \nBrewer and Arizona Attorney General Tom Horne , who is taking the lead on the countersuit , announced the state 's plans Thursday outside a federal court in Phoenix . \nArizona 's move is an attempt to strike back at the Obama administration for a lawsuit blocking parts of a controversial law Brewer signed in April . \nIt authorized police to identify and help deport those suspected of being in the country illegally . \nThe measure sparked protests in Arizona and around the country . '' \n-LRB- Arizona -RRB- did not want this fight , '' Brewer said . \n`` But now that we are in it , Arizona will not rest until our border is secured . '' \nDepartment of Homeland Security spokesman Matt Chandler called Arizona 's court claim a `` meritless '' one that `` does nothing to secure the border . '' \n`` Smart strategies , dedicated law enforcement personnel and strategic partnerships with state , local and tribal governments and agencies do , '' Chandler said . \n`` Not only do actions like this ignore all of the statistical evidence , they also belittle the significant progress that our men and women in uniform have made to protect this border and the people who live alongside it . '' \nWhile vocal opponents of the immigration law continued to chant and wave banners , Horne detailed the five-count suit that included claims the federal government failed to protect Arizona 's borders from the `` invasion of illegal aliens '' and costs associated with `` jailing criminal immigrants . '' \nBrewer has promised only private funds will pay for the suit and launched www.KeepAZsafe.com to collect donations . \nFighting to hold back tears , Brewer thanked supporters , who she noted had offered prayers amidst personal attacks she said she has endured . \nBut she bounced back , saying , `` If you know one thing about Jan Brewer , you know that I m not a quitter . \nArizona is doing its duty . '' \nThousands of people waved Egyptian flags and roared , `` Get out ! \nin Cairo 's Tahrir Square as President Hosni Mubarak said late Thursday he was delegating power to his vice president and made no mention of stepping down . \n`` I do n't know if he has a brain or if his brain is elsewhere , '' one protester in the square said , expressing frustration that Mubarak appeared to be saying that he enjoyed support from most Egyptians . \nWatching Mubarak 's address on what appeared to be a sheet hoisted over the square , the crowd became angry as they heard Mubarak say he would `` delegate powers '' to Vice President Omar Suleiman but did not mention leaving office . \nThey broke into cries of , `` Illegitimate ! '' \nand `` Mubarak the coward must stand down . '' \nAfter the statement , parliamentary speaker Ahmed Fathi Srour told Nile TV that Mubarak 's move had put the authority for the day-to-day running of the government in Suleiman 's hands . \nThat would include oversight of the police , the interior ministry and other key agencies , as well as control of economic policy and running any negotiations with opposition figures . \nSrour added that the constitution specifically prohibits the president from delegating certain key powers to the vice president , including the power to dismiss parliament or dismiss the government and the power to ask for amendments to the constitution . \nAlbert Einstein made many contributions to modern science , but it 's the videos , bobblehead dolls and Halloween masks using his image that continue to generate millions of dollars long after his death . \nBut his granddaughter , Evelyn , said she has n't received a dime from the marketing and sales of Einstein merchandise , while others have profited . \n`` I 'm outraged , '' said the younger Einstein , who says she is a 69-year-old cancer survivor and needs the money for health care . \n`` It 's hard for me to believe they would treat the family the way they have , which has been abysmally .

'' \nThat is not to say , of course , that the Tar Heels stood idly by as the Blue Devils made their move . \nUNC 's freshmen standouts Kendall Marshall and Harrison Barnes lit up the court with not only their defensive know-how and skillful offensive . \nJust one week after point guard Larry Drew abruptly left the team , the Heels held their own and forced their archrivals to step up their own game . \nMandel explains : `` The Blue Devils did n't look so tough in the first half . \nWith the help of North Carolina 's upstart freshman point guard , Kendall Marshall , putting the ball in all the right places , Tar Heel big men Tyler Zeller and John Henson made mincemeat of Duke defenders Mason and Miles Plumlee and Ryan Kelly . \nIn building a 43-29 halftime lead , UNC outrebounded Duke 27-18 and outscored the Devils 28-12 in the paint . \n` We had to really face the facts and get real and know that we had to turn it around in the second half or we were going to get embarrassed out there , ' said Curry .

'' \nGhonim , who was freed Monday after being held by Egyptian authorities for 10 days , said it is `` no longer the time to negotiate '' with the regime of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak . \n`` There 's a lot of blood now '' that has been spilled , he said . \nIt 's time for people at the highest levels of the government `` to apologize to the families '' of those killed , he said . \nHuman Rights Watch said Tuesday 302 people had been killed in the Egyptian protests -- 232 in Cairo , 52 in Alexandria and 18 in Suez . \n`` A lot of times , the policeman would stand on the bridge and shoot people down , '' Ghonim said . \n`` This is a crime . \nThe president need to step down because this is a crime . '' \nGhonim played a key role in organizing the protests that have convulsed Egypt for more than two weeks . \nHe was the administrator of a Facebook page that is widely credited with calling the first protest January 25 . \n`` The plan was to get everyone onto the street , '' he said . \n`` Number one was that we are going to start from poor areas . '' \nGallery : Protesters on streets in Egypt As the plan succeeded , the organizers ' tactics shifted , he said . \n`` We went on the street on the 25th and we wanted to negotiate , '' he said . \n`` They decided to negotiate with us at night with rubber bullets , with police sticks , with water hoses , with tear gas and with arresting about 500 people . \nWe got the message . \nNow , when we escalated this and it became really big , they started listening to us . '' \nThe 30-year-old was on leave from his job at Google in Dubai , where he lives with his wife and two children , when he went to Egypt to participate in the demonstrations . \nGhonim , who refers to himself as an Egyptian activist , describes himself as `` Head of Marketing -- Middle East & North Africa at Google '' on his LinkedIn.com profile . \nHis disappearance on January 28 captured international attention . \n`` I work for the best company to work for in the world , '' he said . \n`` I have the best wife and I love my kids , but I 'm willing to lose all of that for my dream to happen , and no one is going to go against our desire . \nThen , with a tear track running down his cheek , he challenged Vice President Omar Suleiman to try to undo his efforts and those of his supporters . \n`` Kidnap me , kidnap all my colleagues ! '' \n`` Put us in jail ! \nDo whatever you want to do . \nWe are getting back our country . \nYou guys have been ruining this country for 30 years . \nHe showed CNN on Wednesday a notarized power of attorney granting control of all his assets to his wife . \nHolding it up , he said , `` I 'm ready to die '' to bring change to Egypt . \nGhonim cited as his greatest heroes Mohandas K. Gandhi , the father of India 's independence movement , and Mark Zuckerberg , the 26-year-old founder of Facebook . \nA crowd of thousands cheered Ghonim on Tuesday when he spoke at Tahrir Square , where hundreds of thousands of protesters have demanded change for more than two weeks . \nAs he walked through the streets of his upscale neighborhood Wednesday , unaccompanied by security and clutching a laptop , passersby recognized him and ran up to kiss him on the cheek and embrace him . \nA taxi driver stopped his car in traffic , got out and hugged the 30-year-old executive . \nAnother driver handed a cell phone to Ghonim and asked him to say a few words to his daughter . \nYet Ghonim said he is uncomfortable about being the face of the popular uprising in Egypt . \n`` This is not about me , '' he said several times during an hour-long interview in a relative 's Cairo apartment . \nGhonim added that he is proud of the protests , which he described as a `` youth revolution '' and `` Revolution 2.0 . '' \nThe Muslim Brotherhood , he said , played no role in organizing the initial protests , and in fact `` would not participate . '' \nGhonim conceded that Mubarak has `` sacrificed a lot '' for Egypt but said the 82-year-old leader represents a system that needs to be replaced . \nHe demanded that Mubarak 's ruling National Democratic Party be dissolved immediately . \nHe also said , though , that Mubarak should be treated with dignity . \nHe said the initial goal of the protests was to call for the resignation of Egypt 's unpopular interior minister and demand improved conditions for the poor . \nThe calls for Mubarak 's resignation came after Egyptian security forces responded to peaceful protests with force , he said . \nPolice clashed with protesters in the early days of the protests , before being replaced by the military , which created a generally more peaceful atmosphere . \nGhonim , who comes from an affluent Egyptian family , said the activists who organized the protests intentionally designed their movement to be anonymous and faceless , without a clear leader . \nHe cited the movie `` V for Vendetta '' as a source of inspiration . \nWhen asked whether he was referring to a famous scene of the film 's protagonist blowing up Parliament in London , Ghonim laughed . \nNo , he said , he drew inspiration from a character who anonymously advocated for change . \n"}

'' \nAboul Gheit asked rhetorically . \n`` For the army to rule , to step in , to put its friends on the scene , that would be a very dangerous possibility . '' \nCould Hosni Mubarak step down Thursday ? \nProtesters ' mood ` festive ' in Egypt Ghonim : Welcome to Egypt revolution 2.0 He urged the protesters to adopt `` some rationality '' and said the self-proclaimed Council of the Wise , a group of prominent Egyptians from various walks of life , should determine a course of action . \nAboul Gheit told PBS that Mubarak 's interest was to protect the stability of the most populous nation in the Arab world . \nThat 's why he will not accede to the protesters ' demands that he relinquish power immediately , he said . \n`` He thinks that it would entail chaos and it would entail violence and it would entail also opportunities for those who would wish to act in a manner to threaten the state , the stability of the country and society , '' Aboul Gheit said . \nHuman Rights Watch has put the death toll at more than 300 since the January 25 rally that ignited the movement . \n`` Instead of running scared , the regime is fighting back with both words and violence to quash its opponents , portraying the opposition as a foreign-backed , un-Egyptian group of conspirators , '' Human Rights Watch said Wednesday on its website . \n`` Sadly , its propaganda campaign appears to be as crude as its actual physical crackdown has been . '' \nThe protests were largely peaceful Wednesday , with demonstrators in one rally composed solely of children who chanted anti-Mubarak slogans . \n`` We want the whole regime to end because they are not making our lives any easier , '' said 11-year-old Yousef Saeed . \nSome of their older relatives said they had brought the children to the square to witness history unfolding . \n`` It is the birth of freedom , '' said Saeed 's uncle , Mohammed Mostafa . \n`` Witnessing this event will engrave in them love of this nation , loyalty , freedom and respecting change . \nI want them to be free . '' \nBut the prospect of freedom was competing with the cost of living as a motivator for some Egyptians , 20 % of whom live in poverty . \n`` Whether Hosni stays or Hosni goes , what 's important is that the youth get jobs , '' said Amgad , a mother of three living an hour outside Cairo , in the rural town of Fayoum on the Nile Delta . \nHer work at a doctor 's office earns her $ 30 per month -- not enough to pay the electricity bill . \nThe embattled president , meanwhile , went about business as usual Wednesday , meeting with his foreign minister and Russia 's deputy foreign minister , state-run television showed . \nThe unrest extended beyond Cairo . \nTwo people were killed and others were wounded in clashes with police in southern Egypt , state TV reported . \nA journalist said the hostilities stemmed from complaints about a member of the police force in Kharga . \nIn the northern town of Port Said , protesters attacked the governor 's building over a land and housing dispute , state TV said . \nThe protesters were galvanized by the tears and words of an activist who was seized by security forces and held for 10 days before he was released Monday . \n`` If you are true Egyptians , if you are heroic Egyptians , it 's time to step down , '' Wael Ghonim told CNN Wednesday in a message directed to the ruling elite . \nThe 30-year-old Egyptian father of two administered the Facebook page that is widely credited with calling the first protest . \nGhonim , on leave from his job at Google in Dubai , said he was prepared to die for the cause . \n`` Kidnap me , kidnap all my colleagues !

'' \nThe statement also hinted the White House harbors doubts as to whether the Egyptian government is seriously committed to reforms , referring to the regime 's statements as `` what the government is saying it is prepared to accept . '' \nMeanwhile , an Arab diplomat said that Saudi Arabia would consider matching the more than $ 1.5 billion in military aid that the United States provides each year to Egypt if Washington were to cut it . \nCNN 's Ben Wedeman , Nic Robertson , Saad Abedine , Amir Ahmed , Caroline Faraj and Frederik Pleitgen contributed to this report . \n"}

So President continue your stride and above all remain STRONG !!! Even though we do not SHOUT the LOUDEST we re with you President Obama !!!

' '' \nsaid William Quandt , a professor of politics at the University of Virginia and a National Security Council staff member in the 1970s who was involved in the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty . \n`` The military said we are the backbone of the regimes , and we are pretty popular with the people .

'' \nThat communiqu set up an expectation among street protesters in Cairo that Mubarak would resign . \nInstead , Mubarak announced that he would be turning over his day-to-day powers to his hand-picked vice president , Omar Suleiman , an action that makes Suleiman the de facto president of Egypt and head of the military , said Egyptian ambassador Sameh Shoukry to the United States . \nMubarak remains the de jure , or matter of law , president , Shoukry said , attributing the information to the Egyptian government . \n`` The hardliners in the regime were hoping that an attrition strategy would work , and people would leave the square , and in fact , yesterday was one of the biggest turnouts ever because of the release of this Google guy and the unions declared their solidarity and so did the doctors , '' Quandt said . \nThen the state-run newspaper Al-Ahram broached the subject of the `` revolution '' and said the people 's demands were legitimate , Quandt said Thursday . \n"}

{"id": "129", "time": "2011-02-03", "text": "Egyptian soldiers did nothing to stop the violence in Cairo on Wednesday `` Let the military take over and protect you , '' Egyptian state TV declared Egypt expert : Absence of intervention is meant to intimidate Official : Cairo has a `` serious problem '' with the way Obama is `` spinning '' events -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The fiery , bloody clashes between demonstrators in Cairo -- with soldiers watching with seeming indifference -- is an apparent maneuver by the Egyptian military to raise popular support for their intervention and the old guard police state , analysts say . \nEgyptian state television on Wednesday went so far as to portray the protesters as members of a radical fringe and bluntly stated : `` Let the military take over and protect you and Egypt . '' \n`` We have confirmed reports that there are radical elements heading to cause internal strife . \nThey have balls of fire and they want to start fire in the Tahrir -LRB- Liberation -RRB- Square , '' Egyptian television said . \nMuch international media coverage has focused on the violence in Cairo 's Liberation Square between antagonists and protagonists for embattled President Hosni Mubarak . \nIt remained unclear whether such confrontations were being repeated elsewhere . \nContesting rallies in Egypt 's second-largest city , Alexandria , were largely peaceful . \nOther Cairo neighborhoods also remained calm . \nViolence boils over in Cairo Mubarak ` borrowing from book of Saddam ' ? \nBut Wednesday 's events in Liberation Square highlighted pro-Mubarak demonstrators charging -- dramatically on horseback and camels -- anti-Mubarak protesters , the first sign of a counter-demonstration after days of mass anti-government protests . \nIn stark juxtaposition , as the violence unfolded , the army did nothing . \n`` The military 's refusal to act is a highly political act which shows that it is allowing the Egyptian regime to reconstitute itself at the top and is highly , utterly against the protesters , '' said Joshua Stacher , assistant professor of political science at Kent State University and an expert on Egypt . \nHe was among more than a dozen Middle East experts who met Monday with three White House National Security Council officials to talk about the Egyptian crisis . \nThe absence of military action serves two purposes , Stacher said . \n`` Make the protesters go home , and two , scare the population that is n't protesting , '' Stacher said . \n`` They want the Egyptian people to submit to the police state , and they want the people to pine for their police state , so that they have stability back . '' \n`` It 's getting really ruthless , '' Stacher added . \nIn Egypt , Vice President Omar Suleiman issued a statement saying that dialogue with opposition forces , as ordered by Mubarak , wo n't begin until the demonstrations stop . \nMubarak had incited another round of protests Tuesday when he said he would wait until the September elections to step down . \nDemonstrators said they wanted an immediate exit by Mubarak . \nMeanwhile , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has begun a round of discussions with Suleiman as the Egyptian government has begun defending the pace of change and pushing back against American criticism , according to a senior U.S. official . \nEgypt 's president is going to move at his own pace and not be pressured by Obama and other world leaders , an Egyptian government official told CNN . \nAt the same time , a senior U.S. official is expressing concern about Mubarak 's ties to the violence in Cairo . \nCooper among reporters attacked in Egypt Google connects Egyptians to Twitter What 's next for Egypt 's economy ? \nU.S. officials are suspicious that Mubarak loyalists unleashed pro-Mubarak forces to intimidate protesters , the U.S. official said . \n`` Perhaps '' Mubarak is making a mess that only he can `` solve , '' the source added . \nIn a public statement , the spokesman for the State Department called for restraint . \n`` The use of violence to intimidate the Egyptian people must stop . \nWe strongly call for restraint , '' P.J. Crowley said in a statement Wednesday . \nHowever , an Egyptian government official said the government has a `` serious problem '' in how the Obama administration has been `` spinning '' the events yesterday to give the impression that Mubarak 's statement was given under pressure or a `` nudge '' from Obama . \nRobert Kagan of the Brookings Institution said the military appears to be helping the pro-government demonstrators in Cairo . \n`` It tells me that the military does n't appear to be playing the neutral , benevolent role that we hoped it would , '' Kagan told CNN . \n`` It does appear to be not only allowing these brutal pro-government thugs to come in and attack the protesters but maybe even facilitating it , which raises very serious questions about what role the military intends to play in this whole period of transition . \n`` It 's a very cynical move which I hope the rest of the world , and particularly the United States , do n't fall for , '' Kagan said . \nMichele Dunne , a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace , said it was unclear what the military 's agenda is . \n`` Does this mean they 're committed to Mubarak , or does it mean that perhaps they 're giving him one last chance , one last try to see if he can get control of the streets and get the demonstrators out ? '' \n`` I think today we saw a very ugly face of this regime . \nThese are tactics that are well-known in Egypt and have been used many times before -- to send regime thugs to break up peaceful demonstrations , '' she said . \nCNN 's Jill Dougherty and Elise Labott contributed to this report . \n"}
{"id": "72", "time": "2011-02-03", "text": "The Egyptian people are not buying what Hosni Mubarak is selling . \nIn fact , the anti-government protesters have only become more emboldened since Mubarak 's announcement that he 'll step down from the presidency - but not until September . \nBut they want him gone now . \nThey think 30 years is long enough . \nHowever , that does n't seem to matter much to Mubarak . \nHe told ABC 's Christiane Amanpour that he 's sick of being president and would like to leave office now . \nBut he says he ca n't for fear of the country slipping into chaos . \nThat 's as opposed to what we 're seeing in the streets of Cairo right now . \nAs for the people shouting insults at him , Mubarak says , `` I do n't care what people say about me . \nRight now I care about my country , I care about Egypt . '' \nEarlier this week , President Obama seemed to suggest Mubarak step down sooner rather than later , saying an orderly transition to a new regime `` must begin now . '' \nU.S. officials say the protest movement is n't going away - it 's only getting bigger . \nThey worry that the longer the crisis goes on without a resolution , the worse the economic impact and violence will become . \nAlready there are food and fuel shortages and bank closures . \nOther world leaders have also called on Mubarak to step aside , including Turkey 's prime minister , who says Mubarak should `` satisfy the people 's desire for change '' without hesitation . \nOthers are suggesting an interim `` caretaker government '' that could oversee the upcoming elections . \nHere s my question to you : Should Mubarak be forced out now rather than waiting until his term expires in September ? \nInterested to know which ones made it on air ? \nThe Middle East is starting to look like one big game of dominoes . \nAs the kings , unelected presidents and emirs watch what 's going on in the streets of Cairo , they 've got to be wondering if they 're going to be next . \nEgyptian President Hosni Mubarak 's days are clearly numbered . \nAt this point , it seems highly unlikely he 'll even make it through the rest of his term . \nMubarak would be following Tunisian President Zine El Abedine Ben Ali out the door after similar popular street movements pushed him out of power . \nNo doubt about it , some sort of genie is out of the bottle . \nYemen President Ali Abdullah Saleh says he wo n't seek re-election when his term ends in 2013 . \nThat 's after more than three decades in office . \nHe also says he wo n't hand power over to his son . \nOf course , he made that announcement ahead of a `` day of rage '' protest scheduled for Thursday . \nThousands of people have already been demonstrating in Yemen in recent weeks . \nOver in Jordan , King Abdullah has sacked his government and appointed a new prime minister in the face of protests . \nThe king is asking the new government to implement what he calls `` genuine political reform . '' \nIt s funny how `` reform '' has suddenly become a priority in some of these countries after decades of repressive governments . \nMeanwhile , demonstrators also are calling for change in Algeria and Sudan . \nAnd in Syria , there are protests planned for this week . \nExperts say these protests sweeping across the Middle East and North Africa are `` unprecedented '' and a `` watershed event for the Arab world . '' \nFor now , the leadership in Saudi Arabia and Libya seems secure , but it 's safe to say a new day is dawning . \nHere s my question to you : What 's next for the Middle East ? \nInterested to know which ones made it on air ? \nSomebody suggested , `` The devil you know is better than the devil you do n't know . '' \nWhen it comes to Egypt , Hosni Mubarak is the devil we know . \nRuling for the last three decades , Mubarak has maintained Egypt as a moderate regional force in the face of extreme Islamist nations . \nHe 's also helped keep peace with Israel . \nNow Mubarak says he 's not running for re-election and it 's unclear how much longer he will cling to power . \nWhich brings us to who 's the devil we do n't know ? \nHistory suggests we might want to watch what we wish for : Remember when the Bush administration pushed for democratic elections in Gaza and Hamas won ? \nOr go back a little further : When the Shah of Iran was toppled 30 years ago , the ayatollahs took over and Iran became an Islamic republic . \nThe Iranian Revolution was originally backed by many groups - much like the one in Egypt - but the extremists took control of the movement - and look where we are today . \nSome worry the same thing could happen in Egypt . \nThey fear the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood . \nEven though the extremely conservative Islamic organization is banned from Egypt , it 's still the largest opposition group . \nBut not everyone agrees . \nEgyptian opposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei rejects the idea that Islamic fundamentalists will take over . \nThe secular ElBaradei says he 's reaching out to the Muslim Brotherhood and that they need to be included in any new government . \nHere s my question to you : What are the risks if Mubarak is removed from power in Egypt ? \nAs Egyptian protesters demanding reform fill the streets by the hundreds of thousands , it 's worth remembering that the U.S. helps control the purse strings in that country . \nAmerican taxpayers give $ 1.5 billion dollars a year in foreign aid to Egypt , second only to Israel . \nAlthough the White House has said it 's reviewing this aid depending on the military 's behavior - One top Republican says now is not the time to threaten to withhold any of this money . \nCongresswoman Kay Granger - who chairs the house subcommittee in charge of foreign aid - says we should n't use the money as a stick to force Mubarak into reforms . \nGranger says most of the $ 1.5 billion goes toward the military - which seems to be a stabilizing force among the demonstrators . \nGranger says Congress should only consider withholding aid if there 's evidence that U.S. military equipment is being used improperly . \nSeveral top Democrats are on the same page , saying the U.S. should remain committed to assisting Egypt . \nThey point to the close relationship between the two countries . \nNonetheless , some experts think cutting financial aid is the best way to get results . \nA bipartisan group of former officials says the administration should suspend all aid to Egypt until the government : Agrees to elections as soon as possible , allows banned candidates to run , immediately lifts the state of emergency that 's been in place for decades , releases political prisoners , and allows for freedom of the media and assembly . \nHere s my question to you : Should the U.S. withhold any of its $ 1.5 billion in financial aid to Egypt ? \nInterested to know which ones made it on air ? \nJack Cafferty sounds off hourly on the Situation Room on the stories crossing his radar . \nNow , you can check in with Jack online to see what he 's thinking and weigh in with your own comments online and on TV . \nWould you ride in a car that drives itself ? \nIs she the answer ? \nShould the #LoneStarState be allowed to withdraw from U.S. ? \n"}

'' \nIraqi police opened fire , ostensibly to disperse the crowd , and wounded three protesters in the process , the officials said . \nFour others were hurt while skirmishing with police outside the council building . \nEventually , tribal and civic leaders intervened to end the demonstration , the officials said . \nSome of the protesters carried items such as water tubes and oil lanterns to demonstrate a lack of basic services like water and reliable power . \nAbu Sajad , a protester , said that sewage had flooded the small town 's streets after heavy rain in recent days , and he complained that `` the government has n't done anything to solve it '' even though it happens every year . \n`` We 've suffered a lot from bad services in the town , '' Fadhil Hussein , a 50-year-old protester , told CNN . \n`` One government comes and another leaves , and nothing has changed in this town for decades . '' \nDozens of protesters in Kut , part of another predominantly Shiite province about 110 kilometers south of Baghdad , Thursday demanded the resignation of Wasit 's provincial governor , Latif Hamed , according to a Wasit police official and an Iraqi Interior Ministry official . \nThese were the latest in a string of demonstrations around Iraq , mostly emphasizing the same themes -- low-quality public services and a dearth of basic commodities . \nThat was the case Monday , when dozens of protesters took to the street in northern Baghdad 's al-Husseinya district . \nA day earlier , nearly 200 Iraqis demonstrated in two locations in Baghdad to show solidarity with those in Egyptian rallying against their President Hosni Mubarak and to criticize their own leaders . \n"}

'' \nA senior Obama administration official knocked down a New York Times report that the Egyptians and Americans were near consensus on a specific proposal . \n`` It 's simply wrong to report that there 's a single U.S. plan that 's being negotiated with the Egyptians , '' the official said . \nU.S. officials have made clear in recent days their desire to jumpstart talks between opposition and ruling forces in order to lay the groundwork as soon as possible for a governmental transition . \nThat includes pressuring , besides Mubarak 's government , opposition groups to engage immediately in talks . \nMubarak has announced he will not seek re-election in September . \nProtesters , however , continue to demand that he step down immediately , with a caretaker unity government running the country until the fall elections . \nWhile some , like former Foreign Minister and Arab League Secretary General Amr Moussa , believe concessions made by Mubarak presented an opportunity to build upon , members of the opposition Muslim Brotherhood have insisted no talks should take place until the president leaves office . \n`` It 's time for both of them to roll up their sleeves , '' a senior State Department official said . \n`` The government has to take some steps , but the opposition has to be willing to participate in negotiations as well . '' \nEgyptian Vice President Omar Suleiman made `` important statements '' about a political dialogue , the senior official said . \nStill , he added that the Egyptian government should allow the opposition to bring its own ideas , rather than dictate the pace and scope of a transformation to democracy . \nThe urgent call for talks comes as the Egyptian government pushed back on what it described as `` vague '' statements from the Obama administration about the pace of transition . \n"}

'' \nHe said people have been upset that economic dividends have not been evenly distributed and `` the middle class feels it wants and deserves more . '' \nHe said the people who are driving the uprising are n't poorer people from rural areas , where people tend to be a bit more fatalistic and latently supportive of the status quo . \nThey are middle-class and urban people with high expectations who believe they should be employed , but are n't . \nSome pro-Mubarak demonstrators were also in Tahrir Square on Tuesday morning and some residents said they were opposed to the protests . \n`` I am upset with the revolution in Tahrir Square , '' said Muna al-Mahdi , her voice trembling as she spoke in her middle-class Cairo neighborhood . \n`` It does n't represent us . \nIt does n't represent our opinion . \nWe are here sticking with Hosni Mubarak only . \nGive him two months , give him time to work . \nAnd then he can go peacefully .

'' \nAnd Michael , the friends that I 've spoken with there , having lived in Cairo , they 're not a part of these street protests , but they 're still struggling . \nLife is hard now . \nCan you give us the big picture ? \nMICHAEL HOLMES , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : You 're right . \nThat 's something that we do need to emphasize and bring into context . \nYou ca n't make the point enough , actually , that while the streets of the capital in Tahrir Square are obviously violent at the moment , look , there . \nThere 's some normal life going on . \nThe average Egyptian , regardless of political leanings , they 're not out there in the mob . \nTo get the whole picture , you 've got to remember that Egypt is a country of 82 million people , the biggest Arab country in the world . \nAnd while you 're watching on the television as all hell breaks loose in Tahrir Square , the overwhelming majority of Egyptians are just trying to stay out of the way and get on with their lives and try to feed their families . \nMALVEAUX : But even living their lives is difficult , taking your kids to school , or trying to go grocery shopping and that type of thing . \nI mean , there has got to be almost a tipping point to have some out there on the streets and the others who just want some stability . \nHOLMES : There is , and that 's true . \nI mean , they 're not going to school because the schools are closed . \nI mean , schools , universities , banks , the train service , all that stuff has been affected by what 's going on , the uprising right across the country . \nBut Nic Robertson was reporting fishermen in Alexandria saying that their business has been interrupted . \nThese are pictures that Nic shot earlier with Scottie McWhinnie -LRB- ph -RRB- , one of our cameramen there . \nA lot of the markets have run short of basic supplies . \nWe 're hearing reports that in some places , even getting bread is difficult . \nSo check out the scene that Arwa Damon encountered near a local hospital , actually just 10 minutes away from the site of the demonstrations . \nAmbulances were flying up the road to drop off the wounded outside . \nThe streets , though , as you see there , almost eerily quiet outside of Tahrir Square . \nMALVEAUX : And tell us what the communication is like , because , obviously , Facebook , Twitter , cell phones , it 's been very difficult to reach people . \nHOLMES : It has . \nIt 's improved to a degree . \nThe `` Christian Science Monitor '' is reporting that the Internet is back up . \nOur people have been saying that it is , too . \nFacebook finally seems to be back up , actually , for most of Egypt . \nIt 's been a weeklong blackout if you are wanting to post your status update in Egypt . \nThe overall point being that for every protester who might be throwing a rock or a Molotov cocktail , there are thousands of families out there just waiting for this all to end and some stability to come back to the region . \nHow long they 're going to wait for that is anyone 's guess . \nThe bottom line , the chaos you 're seeing in the daily lives of regular Egyptians is n't going to change anytime soon at the moment , particularly while this security vacuum is in place . \nThe military , not going to get involved . \nAnd the police , the hated police , nowhere to be seen . \nThey 're not likely to come back , because if they came back on the streets to try to quell this , it would get worse . \nHOLMES : And I have that from Egyptian officials telling me that , that if the police did come back , it would get worse . \nMALVEAUX : A lot of people are staying away from Tahrir Square . \nAnd what a lot of people do n't know is that Egyptians -- there are a lot of suburbs , and they 're out there . \nAnd it 's , you know , big driveways and streets just like we have here . \nMALVEAUX : Just trying to move along with life . \nHOLMES : Just get the context and keep it in perspective , yes . \nThank you , Michael . \nHOLMES : Good to see you . \nMALVEAUX : Well , as demonstrators flood the streets of Cairo , business owners with ties to Egypt , they 're watching the developments , of course , extremely closely . \nOur CNN Money 's Poppy Harlow , she joins us from New York . \nAnd Poppy , you sat down with an Egyptian-American entrepreneur who gave their sense of the risk here . \nPOPPY HARLOW , CNNMONEY.COM : Yes , exactly right . \nWe spent the day yesterday with Dr. Hossam Abdel Maksoud . \nHe is an Egyptian-American , Suzanne . \nHe moved here in 1984 . \nBut he 's in the pharmaceutical business , and he does business constantly between the U.S. and Egypt . \nHe 's back in Egypt every few months . \nAnd he talked to us about sort of the economic drivers leading up to this crisis , and also what he thinks needs to change as for his business right now . \nHis family members are in the streets with these protesters , blocking off their businesses , trying to protect them from looters . \nHe said all of his business between the U.S. and Egypt has just come to a grinding halt . \nBut here is part of our conversation . \nInteresting to hear his insight on what he thinks especially led to this uprising . \nDR. HOSSAM ABDEL MAKSOUD , EGYPTIAN-AMERICAN BUSINESSMAN : I visit Egypt often , and you see the gap between the rich and the poor getting wider and wider . \nSooner or later , you knew a crisis was going to come to surface . \nOne of the biggest problems is the persistent unemployment . \nAnd for some reason , although we 've seen growth in Egypt since 2004 , this success and this economic growth did not trickle down to the average Egyptian . \nHARLOW : From your point of view , someone who has done very well in a capitalist society , what are the economic reforms you think would help most ? \nMAKSOUD : Infrastructure a little bit . \nHARLOW : Too much red tape ? \nMAKSOUD : Too much red tape . \nAnd there is no really straight , direct , clear guidelines for infrastructure . \nBut in my opinion , giving a young man , an educated young man who finished and spent a lot of time in college and school a job is what leads to security and prosperity . \nIn any society they have to have skills , as well as education . \nHARLOW : So , Suzanne , clearly , he says it all comes down to having the skills to get a job . \nThat one thing that he says all of these young men in the streets want is that option to prosper in the future . \nSo he said that that 's what it comes down to . \nAnd the irony in the short term , Suzanne , is that they 're fighting about the lack of opportunity , economic opportunity in Egypt , and yet this situation it making the economy of Egypt even worse for the foreseeable future -- Suzanne . \nMALVEAUX : And Poppy , did he share his vision for what he wants for the country ? \nHARLOW : He did . \nLook , he said , `` I foresee a prosperous Egypt in the future . \nWe are a resilient people . '' \nAs I mentioned , his entire family is back on the streets in Cairo right now , so that they are fighting for their future , but he says it 's going to be a while before the dust settles and that can happen . \nAnd as you heard , he 's calling for fundamental changes to their education system , saying it 's not enough to give them a degree . \nWhat you have to do is give them skills that they can actually use to be employed and build up our prosperity for themselves and for future generations . \nBut I think bottom line , he 's hopeful -- Suzanne . \nMALVEAUX : All right . \nPoppy , thank you so much . \nWe 're taking a quick look at the markets here . \nI understand the Dow Jones , down eight points -- sorry , I 'm being told nine points now . \nThe Dow Jones down nine points there for the market . \nWell , everybody admits that they do n't like it , but no one seems to know how to get rid of it . \nAnd I 'm talking about the federal deficit . \nA new interactive poll shows voters are not only willing to take on the deficit , they 're pretty darned good at it . \nWe sent CNN 's Tom Foreman to Las Vegas for our series `` Building up America . '' \nAnd Tom , when it comes to economic problems , you could call Nevada the poster child , yes ? \nTOM FOREMAN , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Yes , absolutely , Suzanne . \nYou talk about getting jobs , people here really need them . \nBut this interactive poll which is really interesting -- and we 're the first to have it here at CNN -- looked at about 2,000 Americans , including some here in Nevada , and said despite all these hard times , can we deal with the deficit , and how would you do it ? \nIt was done by a group called the Program for Public Consultation at the University of Maryland , and here is how it worked . \nThey gave everybody a computer program that basically said here is the deficit in 2015 . \nIt 's going to be well over $ 600 billion . \nNow , here are all these parts of the discretionary budget , how you can move things around , make more , make less , make people pay taxes . \nImagine like a great big Rubik 's budget cube that people could move things around on the computer . \nAnd these folks went to work . \nOn average , when they looked at cuts , the biggest things they went after were defense , intelligence , and federal highway programs . \nThey said those things need to be cut . \nThe majority of the group wanted to cut those . \nOther people wanted little increases , not great big ones , and there was n't a majority opinion on this . \nBut generally , the group sort of liked the idea of increases for job training and for higher education and for energy conservation , Suzanne . \nReally interesting on that side of the equation . \nMALVEAUX : And Tom , it 's not all about spending . \nWhat are they saying about the revenue ? \nFOREMAN : You know , Suzanne , from being up on the Hill all those years around the White House , taxes are the big bugaboo out there that everyone is afraid of . \nBut this group was n't afraid of it . \nAnd of course they went after people who are wealthier . \nThey want higher taxes on higher earners and on corporations . \nBut not everybody else gets off the hook . \nBy and large , most of them seemed to see that a lot of people are going to pay more taxes , and they 'd like to see more taxes on alcohol and sugary drinks , at least in this focus group . \nMALVEAUX : And when you consider all the cuts in taxes , what was the bottom line here ? \nFOREMAN : Well , the bottom line is , if this group were put in charge of the deficit -- despite the fact that many of the politicians in Washington say voters have no stomach for this , these were average people out here who took part in this big interactive test . \nIf they were in charge of everything , they were able to produce results that said they could average out to reducing the deficit by about 70 percent . \nThat 's pretty big and that 's pretty hefty . \nBut I will tell you this , Suzanne -- it was n't even all the way across the board . \nThe people who were in this self-identified as to how they were involved in it -- and I want to bring up our last little graphic here to show you . \nIn the end , the Republicans were able to cut the deficit by more than half . \nThe Democrats , by a good bit more than that . \nBut the real winners were the Independents . \nThe Independents , more than anyone , seemed to be able to work this puzzle out . \nThat does n't tell you what the real parties , the real representatives would do in the real world of politics , but it is a very interesting study . \nAnd I think more than anything , Suzanne , it shows that a lot of people out here who want to build up America again know that part of the equation is going to be this tough battle with the deficit and getting it under control , whatever formula we use . \nMALVEAUX : Absolutely , Tom . \nWe 're going to see a real battle there at the White House as well . \nSo thank you very much . \nWe 'll see if they can actually get that done . \nThank you , Tom . \nWell , forget the hospital . \nWe 're going to show you the first stop for treatment for many of those wounded on the streets of Cairo . \nMALVEAUX : A quick look at what 's on the rundown . \nTreating the wounded on the streets of Cairo in the middle of violence . \nAnd a giant cyclone slams Australia . \nChad Myers is going to survey the damage . \nAlso , your answers to our Talk Back question . \nWhat will it take for people to believe that President Obama is a Christian ? \nAnd , finally , the Choose the News winner -- yes , that 's right , the story you picked to air this hour . \nBattles are under way in the streets of Cairo , Egypt . \nThis is day 10 of protests against the government . \nRight now , tanks are keeping those for and against the government separated in Tahrir Square . \nThe situation turned violent when pro-government demonstrators stormed the square . \nState media says at least five people have been killed , more than 800 wounded despite the military presence . \nInternational journalists are being targeted . \nSome are being arrested , others beaten . \nNow , we want to show you what happened to some of our own correspondents , not because we think they 're unique , but because it shows how quickly things can turn . \nHALA GORANI , CNN CORRESPONDENT : I 'm a little bit -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- because I was just shoved out of the way here . \nThis is just a completely surreal experience . \nI 'm being told , walk , walk . \nThis is a little chaotic . \nI have someone helping me out here . \nThis is the scene . \nANDERSON COOPER , HOST , `` AC360 '' -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : I was shooting this video on my Flip camera so as not to attract too much attention . \nSuddenly a man jumped out of the crowd and tried to grab Neil 's camera . \nThat 's when all hell broke loose . \n-LRB- on camera -RRB- : Hey , calm down . \n-LRB- voice-over -RRB- : We only had about a block left to go when another guy came up and punched me in the head . \n-LRB- on camera -RRB- : I 've been hit now like 10 times . \nThe Egyptian soldiers -- the Egyptian soldiers are doing nothing . \nMALVEAUX : What a shame . \nWe understand that everybody is OK , but obviously very difficult reporting circumstances there . \nThis morning a U.S. State Department spokesman condemned those attacks calling them a concerted campaign to intimidate international journalists . \nWhile many of Egypt 's wounded are being treated in makeshift hospitals , our senior international correspondent Bed Wedeman gives us a look inside of those . \nBEN WEDEMAN , CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT -LRB- on camera -RRB- : All right . \nWell , we 're right in Tahrir Square , at what is a mosque that a few days ago was turned into a makeshift field hospital for people wounded in clashes and protests and whatnot . \nWEDEMAN : What we 've been told is some of our other crews who are inside Tahrir Square were roughed up by crowds , thrones of people . \nAnd certainly , as you know , our experience was , yes , they 're not very friendly to the media . \nSo we 've been told to get off the square , to stay away and we were told to come back to the office . \nBut given that to go back to the office we would actually have to cross through some of this hostile territory , our determination is that it is better to stay here where people are more media friendly than to go out there where we 're watching every few minutes somebody comes in with a great big gash on their head from a rock . \nSo , we 're going to stay here . \nObviously a very difficult situation but some people doing a fantastic job at just trying to deal with the circumstances there . \nWell , time is running out for you to Choose the News . \nCast your vote by texting 22360 . \nVote 1 , for Cubans turning to religion during tough times . \nVote 2 , for the woman who found her biological family on Facebook . \nOr vote 3 , for the Egyptian woman who says she is willing to die for freedom . \nThe winning story is going to air later this hour . \nWell , do you know where you 're going to be watching Sunday 's Super Bowl ? \nThis power couple is heading for 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue . \nOne of our entertainment headlines . \nMALVEAUX : An apology on `` American Idol . '' \nAn appearance on `` Saturday Night Live , '' for a singer with a mixed reputation , and an invitation , yes , to the White House for a superstar couple . \nShe 's in Los Angeles with all the entertainment headlines . \nKareen , it is great to see you . \nTell us what happened on `` American Idol '' last night because I did n't see it . \nI did n't get a chance to see it . \nKAREEN WYNTER , CNN ENTERTAINMENT CORRESPONDENT : Well , I will break it all down for you . \nHere 's the deal . \n`` American Idol '' made a very public apology last night . \nBut this morning , Suzanne , no one seems to think it was , well , very sincere . \nThey promoted this big apology pretty heavily , in fact , yesterday , leading to a lot of speculation as to just what the show was actually apologizing for . \nThen at the beginning of last night 's show they ran a statement apologizing for Steven Tyler 's -- he 's one of the hosts -- his behavior . \nBut unless you were plugged in you had no idea what was really going on . \nApparently Tyler told a contestant named Jake Muck his last name rhymed with the profanity -- we 're not going to say it . \nBut most people did n't notice or did n't care because it was n't like it caused a lot of controversy . \nSo , this apology is being seen as either a publicity stunt -- shocking -- to promote just how unpredictable Tyler is or a weak joke . \nBut this one really baffles me . \nWhat 's going on here , Suzanne ? \nMALVEAUX : That 's very interesting . \nNow I understand that Chris Brown is trying to revive his career and clearly his reputation . \nCan you tell us what happened ? \nWYNTER : Well , he 's trying and what better way to do it than on `` Saturday Night Live . '' \nIt was just announced , Suzanne , that the singer will be the musical guest on the show February 12th . \nRussell Brand , by the way , will be the host . \nBrown , of course , he saw his career and life just take a nose dive , go off track after beating up his then-girlfriend Rihanna . \nWe do n't know if brown will appear in a sketch on the show or if he 'll perform . \nBut this is a huge deal , a big , big public appearance for brown who has a new album coming out in March . \nSo , good for him . \nMALVEAUX : Certainly is . \nSo the Super Bowl this weekend . \nThe president -- he 's having a few famous friends over . \nNot you and I. Unfortunately , he did n't invite us . \nWYNTER : What 's going on ? \nI know , I checked the guest list . \nWe 're not on there . \nBut , J. Lo and Marc Anthony , they sure are . \nThey 're going to a very , very special Super Bowl party at the White House . \n's reps confirmed to us that President Obama , he 's invited the celebrity couple to watch the game at his place . \nWe know the president is a huge football fan and since his Chicago Bears , Suzanne , did n't make it to the Super Bowl , it looks like he 'll make the best of it with Marc and J. Lo . \nMALVEAUX : Yes , no. . \nI think they 'll be fine . \nWYNTER : They 'll be OK . \nAnd , they 're not just football fans , but Anthony is part owner of the Miami Dolphins . \nAnd , you know the White House better than I think anyone at the network , Suzanne . \nSo what do you think would be the perfect dish to bring to the White House Super Bowl party ? \nMALVEAUX : Well , it 's funny because they have all these snacks that they have anyway . \nSo they 've got salsa and chips and what I understand they 've got these huge chocolate chip cookies that they serve around on plates and everybody loves that . \nThat 's like the favorite . \nSo everybody 's eating those chocolate chip cookies . \nBut , hey , you know , I guess you could bring anything if you can get it through security , though . \nBecause I do n't think the president is just going to eat anything . \nWYNTER : That 's a good point . \nand Marc , they 'll be snacking all Sunday night long . \nMALVEAUX : All right . \nMALVEAUX : Nice you see you , too . \nToday on `` Showbiz Tonight , '' the heat is on Lindsay Lohan as police name her a suspect in a grand theft case . \nCould this drama land Lohan in prison ? \n`` Showbiz Tonight '' has Lindsay 's new legal limbo live at 5:00 p.m. Eastern on HLN . \nDAVID LETTERMAN , `` THE LATE SHOW WITH DAVID LETTERMAN '' : What a storm all across the country . \nAs a matter of fact , in Chicago -- in Chicago alone there was so much snow -- here 's how much snow there was in Chicago . \nNo new relatives have been able to reach Oprah . \nMALVEAUX : This week 's blizzard will go down as one of the worst in recent memory . \nIt broke records in a lot of places . \nChicago , as he was mentioning , got its third biggest snowfall on record . \nAlmost two feet in some areas . \nWhile the storm has moved on , there are still some serious concerns . \nDriving , of course , is dangerous . \nA lot of roads , highways still covered with snow and ice . \nWell , a lot of you are responding to our `` Talk Back '' question about President Obama 's religion . \nWhat will it take for people to believe that President Obama is a Christian ? \nEdward says , `` unfortunately , for this president , it will take an act of God . '' \nMore of your responses ahead in our `` Talk Back '' segment . \nMALVEAUX : We have some new information coming out of Egypt to tell you about . \nAnother incident of a journalist being attacked . \nAs we have already reported today , there are journalists who are attempting to cover the unrest and they are now being targeted in Egypt -- across Egypt . \nThe latest today in Imbaba . \nThis is a poor neighborhood of Cairo . \nAccording to our photojournalist Mary Rogers , a woman by the name of Marie Colvin , she is a journalist for `` The Sunday Times '' of London , was almost killed by a gang of men with knifes . \nAnd she says that one of them was a policeman in uniform . \nAnd our Mary Rogers tells us that if it was not for the kindness of these strangers to help this fellow journalist out from `` The London Times , '' a group of other men , they were trying going to -- they were trying to grab her and so they took her , they put her in a store , they locked it so that she would not have been killed , but they believe that she was just in that kind of danger . \nThat is the kind of situation on the ground that is taking place throughout Egypt , but specifically in places that we have seen the kind of video here -- the chaos . \nAnd these are people who are just trying to bring the story to you from both sides who obviously are facing some very difficult conditions . \nWell , when the rocks and machete 's flew in Cairo 's Tahrir Square , American Hunter -- the American , rather , Hunter Moore , he was in the crowd . \nHunter is a young American who was working as a teacher in Cairo . \nHe and a friend , they shot this video that you 're watching for a CNN i-Report while helping the wounded yesterday . \nAnd he plans to jump in again today if necessary . \nI spoke with Hunter Moore just within the last hour . \nHUNTER MOORE -LRB- via telephone -RRB- : We 've been out there since last Tuesday , the 25th , and sort of assessed the need of what we could do to help . \nAnd we realized that we could get some medical supplies and some food to distribute . \nSo that 's kind of the role that we played in -- MALVEAUX : What kind of injuries did you see ? \nMOORE : I beg your pardon . \nMALVEAUX : What kind of injuries did you see ? \nMOORE : Mostly head injuries . \nEasily 90 percent head injuries . \nSome that required much more medical attention than we could offer . \nA lot of it was , you know , many needed stitches . \nBut it was mostly head injuries and a lot of them had come two or three times because they 'd get -- they 'd get patched up and they 'd run right back out there and come back with another head injury minutes later . \nMALVEAUX : And this was from what ? \nI understand there were machetes , there were rocks . \nSo -- MALVEAUX : And what were people saying to you ? \nWas there a sense of despair ? \nYou said they went back out and would fight again . \nMOORE : Yes , they went back out over and over again . \nThey were screaming about freedom , screaming about democracy . \nThere were -- there was a lot of solidarity in the crowd . \nThey were thanking me . \nIt was a really -- an amazing time to be out there . \nMALVEAUX : And , Hunter , in light of your experience here , you 've been in Cairo for quite some time . \nDo you have a sense that this is -- it 's time for you to go ? \nThat you should leave this country ? \nMOORE : Not quite . \nYou know , I 'm kind of -- just this past day we 've been -- we have n't been able to get down to Tahrir due to some rumors . \nAnd we 've tried to go , but we were warned by many people that they were being pretty hostile to foreigners . \nSo we set kind of an ad hoc food drive and also a Facebook group called Medical Aid for Cairo , that we 're trying to organize getting some medical aid and food to the people of Cairo that need it right now . \nMALVEAUX : Hunter is working on a master 's degree in middle eastern studies at the American University of Cairo . \nHe teaches English on the side . \nWell , here is your chance to talk back on one of the big stories of the day , President Obama 's religion . \nHe spoke about people doubting his Christian faith at the National Prayer Breakfast earlier today . \nCarol Costello following this . \nCAROL COSTELLO , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Oh , it 's time to talk back and people are really talking back . \nAnd we appreciate it because the comments are -- they 're actually fabulous and thoughtful and I love them . \nAt the National Prayer Breakfast , as you said , Suzanne , President Obama got really personal about his faith and Jesus . \nSome suspect he did that because one in five people in this country think President Obama is Muslim . \nSo the `` Talk Back '' today , what will it take for people to believe President Obama is a Christian ? \nHe says , `` the president of the United States is elected to run the executive branch of this country , not be the American version of the pope . \nWhether he is Muslim or Christian should not matter . '' \n`` If his name was John Smith , we would n't have this problem .

Nidal Hasan is accused in the shootings , which left 13 people dead and 32 wounded . \nHe faces a likely court-martial and potential death penalty . \nBitter cold , with some more snow and ice mixed in , will follow the monster storm that dominated much of the country earlier in the week . \nWisconsin can expect wind-chill values between 20 and 25 degrees below zero Fahrenheit , and parts of Maine and New Hampshire can expect several inches of new snow , the National Weather Service said . \nSleet and freezing rain are expected along the Gulf Coast . \nAll of this is coming as vast areas try to clear streets and restore electricity after the massive storm that brought as much as 2 feet of snow to some locales . \nAustralians are still feeling the effects of Cyclone Yasi , whose torrential rain and high winds have knocked out power to large portions of the country 's northeast . \nDemonstrations continue in Cairo , Egypt , after anti-government protesters held their ground overnight in the capital city 's Tahrir Square . \nEgyptian Prime Minister Ahmed Shafiq said Wednesday 's attacks on demonstrators would be investigated . \nMeanwhile , in Jordan , the main Islamist group says it plans further street demonstrations Friday in the capital to protest the appointment of a new prime minister by King Abdullah II . \nThe Islamic Action Front , the political wing of the Muslim Brotherhood , has rejected talks with new Prime Minister Marouf al Bakhit , who is forming a new government . \nBut several of its representatives will be meeting the king later Thursday . \nAnd in Yemen , thousands of anti-government protesters gathered near Sanaa University , indicating many in the country were not satisfied with President Ali Abdullah Saleh 's recent announcement that he would not seek re-election . \nAbout a kilometer away , a large crowd of government supporters gathered for a demonstration . \nSenate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Joe Lieberman and Ranking Member Susan Collins will hold a news conference at noon to release their bipartisan report on the failures of the U.S. government to prevent the November 5 , 2009 , shooting at Fort Hood Army Post that killed 13 people and wounded 32 others . \nToday marks the beginning of year 4709 on the Chinese calendar , the Year of the Rabbit . \nCelebrations were taking place across Asia . \nThe investigating officer in the case of the accused Fort Hood shooter has recommended that the military pursue the death penalty against Maj. Nidal Hasan , according to his lawyer . \nCol. James Pohl , who acted as a judging during the just completed Article 32 hearing , also recommended a general court martial for Hasan , who faces 13 counts of pre-meditated murder and 32 counts of attempted pre-meditated murder in the shootings at Fort Hood on November 5 , 2009 . \nAung San Suu Kyi has spent much of the last two decades under house arrest . \nStill open for dialogue - Freed activist Aung San Suu Kyi said she would continue working on matters of democracy and human rights in Myanmar and doesn t worry about being detained again . \nThe 1991 Nobel Peace Prize recipient has spent 15 of the past 21 years under house arrest for her dogged opposition to authoritarian rule in Myanmar . \nShe insists all parties - both inside and outside of the country - must continue working together . \nMaj. Nidal Hasan is charged with killing 13 people in a rampage last year . \n-LRB- Updated at 11:18 a.m. -RRB- The prosecution has completed presenting its case against alleged Fort Hood shooter and Army psychiatrist Maj. Nidal Hasan . \nThe investigating officer has recessed the proceedings until November 15th , at which time the defense will have an opportunity to present its case . \n-LRB- Updated at 10:18 a.m. -RRB- The prosecution said it plans to wrap up its case against alleged Fort Hood shooter Nidal Hasan on Thursday , and Hasan 's legal team will present its defense in more than two weeks . \nThe prosecution has called more than 50 witnesses who have delivered chilling testimony about the shooting rampage that left 13 dead at a Texas military base . \nHasan is the subject of an Article 32 hearing , which will determine if there is ample evidence to proceed with a court martial . \nThe former Army psychiatrist is charged with killing 13 people and wounding dozens more in a November rampage . \nAn Army officer said he thought the rapid rate of gunfire meant there was more than one shooter in last November 's Fort Hood massacre . \nBut when the shooting ceased after police brought down Nidal Hasan , it became clear he had acted alone , Major Stephen Richter said . \nArmy investigators said Wednesday that Major Nidal Hasan had 177 rounds left when he was finally shot down by police last November . \nHasan is charged with killing 13 people and wounding dozens of others after a rampage last November at Fort Hood . \nA police officer , Major Mark Todd , told the military hearing on Wednesday that he found extra magazines and a second handgun , a revolver , after Hasan finally was subdued , wounded four times . \nTodd and his fellow civilian police officer , Sgt. Kim Munley described the gunfight outside the building where the final stand-off occured . \n`` I challenged him , ` Halt , military police , drop your weapon , ' '' Todd said during his testimony Wednesday morning . \n`` He raised his weapon and fired . '' \nMunley , who was widely praised for her role in ending the shooting admitted in testimony that she did not know how many times she had hit Hasan . \nEven before the Fort Hood shooting ended , nurses and medics rushed to help the wounded . \n`` Nurses and medics get the -LRB- expletive -RRB- out here now - we have soldiers bleeding , '' Sgt. First Class Maria Guerra recalled herself yelling . \n`` You train for this , you train for this , let 's go , '' she said as civilians and soliders came out of hiding to save their fallen buddies . \nA witness in the case against Maj. Nidal Hasan recalled Tuesday the sound that the accused Fort Hood shooter made as he walked down the halls of the processing center where he 'd opened fire that November day . \nShell casings were wedged in the tread of Hasan 's combat boots , making a distinctive `` clack , clack '' as he walked , said Ted Coukoulis , a civilian nurse , on the sixth day of the alleged shooter 's military hearing . \nCoukoulis testified in the Article 32 evidentiary hearing that will determine whether the case will proceed to a court martial and the possible death penalty for Hasan . \n`` It was a casual walk , '' Coukoulis said , comparing it to how someone would walk through a mall . \n`` He stopped firing and started walking toward where I was - clack , clack , clack . '' \nA survivor of last year 's Fort Hood , Texas , shootings testified Monday that the gunman showed no emotion as he killed 13 people and injured dozens more . \n`` He was n't happy , he was n't angry , '' Sgt. 1st Class Miguel Valdivia said of the accused shooter , Maj. Nidal Hasan . \n`` It was some kind of passive look . '' \nValdivia 's testimony came on the fifth day of an Article 32 hearing at the base to determine whether there is enough evidence for Nasan to proceed to a court-martial in the November 2009 shooting spree on the military base . \nThe distant rumble of big guns on Fort Hood 's artillery range rattles the ceiling tiles in the small military courtroom . \nBut the sounds of war training do n't interrupt the intensity inside the military hearing as dozens of witnesses here recall that day last November when 13 people were shot to death and 32 wounded on the base in central Texas . \nTraining with Paladin howitzers is part of everyday life at Fort Hood , the country 's largest Army base . \nMost of the shooting victims were preparing to ship out to the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan . \nBut nothing prepared them for what happened to them at home - dodging bullets as a gunman cut down their buddies . \n-LRB- Updated at 5:19 p.m. -RRB- In response to a question about the telephone video , a Fort Hood official , who insisted on anonymity because of the ongoing criminal investigation related to the shooting , said : `` Since this matter was raised during the Article 32 hearing , it is for the Article 32 hearing officer to decide whether to make further inquiries to the soldier 's chain of command for additional information . '' \n-LRB- Original post -RRB- The shooting at Fort Hood was captured on video by a soldier using his cell phone camera as he hid from the shooter , but he was ordered to erase it , the soldier said Friday . \nPfc. Lance Aviles spoke of the video as he testified on the third day of the Article 32 military hearing for Maj. Nidal Hasan , who is accused of killing 13 people and wounding 32 in the 2009 shooting . \nAviles said he was ordered by a noncommissioned officer to delete the video on the day of the shooting . \nHe did not describe to the court what the video contained . \nHe said he saw the gunman stop to reload and considered rushing him . \nBut by the time Aviles got up , he said , the shooter `` had already loaded another magazine . \nSo instead of running to him , I ran off to the right . '' \nThe Army psychiatrist accused in last year 's Fort Hood , Texas , shootings faced off with the most severely injured survivor Thursday in a small military courtroom . \nMaj. Nidal Hasan looked down as Staff Sgt. Patrick Zeigler described his four bullet wounds and how part of his brain had to be removed because of skull and bullet fragments . \nZeigler , using a cane , walked slowly to the witness stand at Fort Hood for the last testimony of the day in an evidentiary hearing , which is expected to last for weeks . \nHasan is accused of being the gunman in the November 5 shootings that left 13 people dead and dozens wounded . \nZeigler testified he heard the gunman shout out `` Allahu Akbar '' just before the firing began . \n`` After I heard that , I pretty much froze up because I knew what that meant , '' said Zeigler about the phrase , which is Arabic for `` God is great . '' \nThe shooting happened so fast that is sounded like an automatic weapon , one soldier testified . \nSome said they did n't realize they were wounded until they saw their own blood . \nAnd others told how they tried to play dead , hoping the gunman would pass them by . \nThe testimony came Thursday at Fort Hood , Texas , during the military 's evidentiary hearing into the case of Maj. Nidal Hasan , who is accused of the Fort Hood shootings last November that left 13 people dead and dozens wounded . \nSpc. Keara Bono testified she was reading a book in the Fort Hood building , moving through the paperwork and medical tests to deploy to Iraq . \nSuddenly , she said , she was wounded in the head . \n`` At that moment , all I smelled was blood because my face was covered with it , '' she testified Thursday afternoon . \nPfc George Stratton said he was at the processing center that November day getting ready to deploy to Afghanistan . \nIt was to be his third deployment . \n`` All of a sudden my ears started ringing , and I heard loud gunfire right in my ears . \nRound after round -- pop ! \njust like that , '' he testified . \nStratton says he dropped to the ground , and saw a fellow soldier lying on the ground near him , covered in blood . \n`` As soon as I turned I saw Maj. Hasan behind me . \nHe was holding an older-fashioned pistol . \nAs soon as I looked at him , he brought his magazine up and loaded it . \nHe looked straight down at me , we made eye contact , and he brought his weapon down toward me . \nI turned on him , and the weapon fired . \nIt hit me in the left shoulder , my arm went limp , '' Stratton said . \n`` I could n't feel it at all . '' \nStratton says he then hit the ground , and crawled as fast as he could to the door . \nTestifying Wednesday afternoon , Spc. Amber Barr described how she and her buddies ran for their lives when the shooting began . \n`` I saw there was blood . \nI smelled sulfur in the air and I realized it was not a drill , '' she said . \n`` It was absolute chaos , '' she continued . \n`` People just trying to shield themselves from the gunshots . '' \nBarr said she and others managed to get outside and she helped half-carry , half-drag a friend to a nearby pick-up truck which took them and others to the Fort Hood hospital . \nIt was only then , when she tried to sit down , she realized she herself had been shot in the lower back , she said . \nSpc. Matthew Cooke told the hearing he was shot four times but was so charged up on adrenaline he did n't realize he had been wounded . \nHe still carries bullet fragments in his body . \nThe military is holding an evidentiary hearing into the case of Maj. Nidal Hasan , who is accused of the Fort Hood shootings last November that left 13 people dead and dozens wounded . \nThe first witness in the Fort Hood massacre hearing gave a chilling account Wednesday of how he and others were shot last November . \nSgt. Alonzo Lunsford , speaking on the second day of the Article 32 hearing , said Army psychiatrist Maj. Nidal Hasan pulled a weapon from underneath his uniform and began firing . \nHasan is charged with the murder of 13 people at Fort Hood on November 5 and the wounding of 32 others . \n`` I noticed the weapon he was firing had an infrared sight , like a laser sight on the weapon , '' Lunsford said . \n`` He was aiming at the soldiers . '' \nThe military opened a hearing Tuesday for Maj. Nidal Hasan , the U.S. Army psychiatrist accused of last year 's Fort Hood shootings , then adjourned it almost immediately . \nHasan is accused of killing 13 people and wounding 32 in a shooting spree at the Fort Hood Army base in Texas . \nThe hearing will determine whether Hasan will be court-martialed - which could potentially lead to the death penalty . \nCarnival Triumph cruise ship that experienced fire in engine room being towed to Mobile , AL instead of Mexico #CNN Could the next pope be from Africa or Latin America ? \nie\\/11BX93W 7:01 pm ET February 11 , 2013 RETWEET Could the next pope be from Africa or Latin America ? \nly\\/U6vgfT 6:30 pm ET February 11 , 2013 RETWEET Looking for a good car for bad winter weather ? \nCheck these out : cnnmon . \n"}
{"id": "103", "time": "2011-02-03", "text": "As unrest sweeps through the Middle East like wildfire , it 's worth remembering this crisis will cost all of us - especially at the gas station . \nAnd maybe -- just maybe -- this time , the chaos in that part of the world will finally be enough to break America 's addiction to foreign oil . \nAlthough Egypt is not a major oil producer , it plays a key role in the transport of oil and gas headed to the U.S. , Europe and Asia through the Suez Canal . \nWithout it , shippers would have to send crude oil and gas around the Horn of Africa . \nThat adds on more than two weeks of delivery time to global markets . \nWith the ongoing violence and protests in Egypt , some shippers are worried about disruptions to the Suez Canal or nearby pipelines . \nNearly 2.5 million barrels of oil go through the canal every day -- that 's about equal to Iraq 's output . \nAll this comes as global oil supplies are tightening -- mostly due to China 's increasing demand . \nAnd the markets are reacting . \nCrude is trading at more than $ 103 a barrel -- that 's a 28-month high . \nEven before the Mideast erupted , some experts were predicting gas at $ 5 a gallon by 2012 . \nAnd it 's not just about the money . \nSo much of the politics of the region has always been dictated by our need for oil . \nIt would be nice to do what 's in our best national interest for a change ... instead of being beholden to Mideast dictators for their oil . \nHere s my question to you : Should the chaos in the Middle East be enough to break America 's addiction to foreign oil ? \nInterested to know which ones made it on air ? \nIt should be , but it wo n't . \nWe do not have an affordable , long-range , electric-powered alternative to replace our fossil fuel guzzling cars . \nUntil that happens , we are hooked on oil . \nI 'll bet if BP and the other big oil companies held a majority interest in electric or battery production , we would have efficient , low-cost electric or hybrid vehicles next week . \nNot as long as the oil companies run this country . \nThe only way America is going to escape the stranglehold of foreign oil is for oil to become so expensive Americans can no longer afford to buy it . \nOnce that happens , then we will start to get serious about alternate fuels and other modes of transportation . \nRemember gas lines in the 70s ? \nIf that did n't do it , nothing will . \nAmericans are almost more loathe to give up their precious SUV gas-guzzlers than their guns . \nMark in New Jersey writes : Of course not , Jack . \nThe oil companies would never allow it , and they have more to say about it than us , the stupid voters . \nThe House and the Senate are owned by the oil companies -- lock , stock , and barrel , no pun intended . \nShould it be enough ? \nWill it be enough ? \nIt seems we 're happier to complain than make the difficult decisions to remove ourselves from foreign dependence . \nNatural gas , offshore drilling or solar panels , I do n't care ! \nLet 's do all of it and make America strong again ! \nIn the land of two-Hummer families , I do n't think that 's very likely . \nDoes a heroin addict stop buying heroin because his dealer is having a family dispute ? \nForeign oil flows through our national veins like heroin in a junkie , so not only can we not stop , we will not be allowed to stop because they are addicted to our money the same way . \nTerry - Greensburg , IN `` Hoosier Hillbilly '' Should the chaos in the Middle East be enough to break America 's addiction to foreign oil ? \nShow `` US '' the closest re-hab center ! \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 2:59 pm | In the land of two-Hummer families I do n't think that 's very likely . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 3:00 pm | The only way to break the U.S. addiction to foreign oil is to put the entire country into a rehab facility . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 3:10 pm | The caos in the middle east will not affect our addiction to foreign oil because america runs on oil not dunkin donuts . \nThe only affect caos has in the middle east is to raise the price of oil which in turn means more money for the oil companies in the u.s. and more billions for the derivatives gamblers on wall street . \nAll main street can do is to sit back buckle up and pay more money . \nI thought the reason we are spending billions in iraq and afghanistan was to maintain stability in the middle east . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 3:12 pm | if the price hits five dollars that will break out back . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 3:16 pm | Green Energy pushed by President Obama is the right direction . \nHas n't the Middle East been in chaos since 1948 ? \nNothing has changed our addiction to foreign oil or for that matter domestic oil . \nUntil the greed is taken out of the equation or we run out of oil I see nothing changing . \nAt $ 5.00 , or anything near that , Americans will be screaming for relief . \nObama will continue to push for alternatives to fossil fuels . \nThe giant oil companies , and their wholly-owned subsidiary , the Republican Party , will be echoing Sarah Palin 's famous `` Drill Baby , Drill '' chant . \nA compromise is likely and it will certainly diminish , if not end , our addiction to foreign oil . \nOf course not , Jack . \nThe oil companies would never allow it , and they have more to say about it than we , the stupid voters . \nThe House , and the Senate are owned by the oil companies , lock , stock , and barrel , no pun intended . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 3:29 pm | Do n't be silly Jack . \nIn the globalized economy what 's good for a multinational corporation is often times at odds with some if not all nation-states . \nHigh oil prices benefit Big Oil and Big Oil owns our government , largely dictates our foreign policy , and suppress ' any competitor energy by either buying up the technology and shelving it or discrediting the technology with massive disinformation campaigns . \nRest assured that the only thing that will break our addiction to Mid-East oil is the Mid-East running out of oil . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 3:30 pm | Cliff Glass - East Rockaway , NY Maybe you 've forgotten the Supreme Courts Soylent Green decision . \nWhen the Republican majority on the High Court decreed that '' Corporations -LRB- read : oil comanies -RRB- is people '' -- decisions for the collective public good have been permanently discarded in favor of campaign contributions . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 3:32 pm | it 's time for us to start drillingwe have enough oil and other resourses February 3 , 2011 at 3:32 pm | Not likely Jack , Dems will never allow offshore drilling to make it happen . \nAnd they will use the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico as the reason why . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 3:36 pm | It should be but it wo n't , US oil intrests are too powerful . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 3:39 pm | No this wo n't do it . \nThe only thing that will force us to change is when there is n't any available at all . \nThis is like a confirmed smoker who used to pay 10 cents for a pack of cigaretts who still smokes even when the cost is over $ 10 a pack . \nWe may be forced to use less but we 'll still use it . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 3:39 pm | That would be the best thing to happen to us , then maybe we could mind our own business instead of theirs . \nAlthough all know the big oil companies are in bed with the government and they certainly do not want us break up our love affair with oil ! \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 3:41 pm | If not NOW , when ? \nI say to Presiden Obama and all future Presidents it 's time to stop entertaining these Middle East TUGS at the White House . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 3:47 pm | As long as the US is filled with oil lobbyists and aligns itself with dictators , I see no end to foreign oil in sight . \nExpect any move to a greener form of energy to be labeled as `` job killing '' and immediately shot down . \nyou know the drill . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 3:51 pm | Some time it takes tough love to break an addiction . \nThat might be the case for the United States when it comes to Mideast oil . \nWith this kind of unstable Middle East the price for all oil will go through the roof . \nThe oil companies right now with the help from our gov ' t is our main source for fuel . \nBut when the price for oil goes so high that people are unable to afford it . \nThey will protest as loudly as the people in Egypt are protesting . \nThis will force Congress to give alternative fuels an equal playing field and help to get off the ground . \nBefore the oil companies with all their money and powerful lobbyist were always able to squash any outsiders from getting a foothold into the business . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 3:54 pm | Tom Mytoocents Fort Lauderdale , Florida As America struggles to overcome the theft of our economy and treasury from the Titans of TARP we will be forced to overcome the inevitable $ 4.00 a gallon gas of 2007 . . \nAs our economy heals and inflation slowly overcomes money stolen from the Treasury , petroleum stockpiles will decrease driving the barrel\\/gallon price higher . \nOnce the price exceeds $ 4.00 a gallon US , it really does n't matter if it 's $ 4.00 or $ 10.00 a gallon . \nPeople ca n't afford it that signals the end of recovery . \nWe saw this play out in a stronger 2007 economy . \nChaos in the Middle East will likely become the `` Change You can Believe '' promised by Obama . \nThe result will be an end of either the USA or our dependance on OPEC Oil . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 3:54 pm | Paul , New Port Richey , Florida America runs on oil , coal , natural gas and nuclear energy . \nIt is the EPA and our own government that is breaking America 's energy back and not the Middle East . \nThey are simply taking advantage of us with the opportunity handed them by our own people and no doubt rewarding same for their help . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 3:54 pm | Every president since Carter has talked a good talk about energy independence but we will only take action if there is enough pain to motivate us like $ 10\\/gallon gasoline . \nUntil then `` Americans for Prosperity '' will continue to funnel millions of oil and gas industry money -LRB- Thanks to Citizens United -RRB- into pro-oil and gas ads and the coal industry will spend more millions promoting `` clean '' coal . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 3:55 pm | Its nowhere near enough to break our dependency . \nOur country is notorious for learning from mistakes only AFTER the fact . \nWhat a refreshing change of pace it would be if we could alter our behavior before another 1970s oil crisis occurred . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 4:01 pm | NO !! Nothing will break our addiction to `` any '' oil . \nWe have been passing energy bills for some 35 years and when an oil crisis hits we buy fuel efficient cars , pass energy bills , grill oil company executives , threaten NYMEX traders , and even threaten to drop bombs on the oil producing nations . \nAs soon as the price of crude drops back , it is once again back to business as usual until the next crisis , and the next , etc. , etc. , etc. . \nWe American 's account for 3.5 % of the worlds population , but we consume 25 % of the worlds oil supply , and that means that we American 's consume 20,000,000 barrels of oil every day . \nThe figures speak for themselves and we will choke to death on our own gas fumes before we demand consumption limits on our love for crude ! \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 4:02 pm | It should n't have to take chaos to spur change we desperately need . \nIt 's in our best interest to move away from oil , it would help to stabilize our economy . \nSo just as the fuel crunch in the 70 's helped spur the birth of small cars , a steep spike in fuel prices now should spur interest in electric and fuel cell vehicles . \nLike Plato said : ` Necessity is the mother of invention ' February 3 , 2011 at 4:05 pm | Nothing short of hitting rock bottom will break our addiction to foreign oil , and we 're still a long way from that . \nAs long as the price of oil escalates there are escalating profits to be made . \nForeign devils will pump it , fleets will ship it , middlemen and speculators will flip it and Washington will tax it . \nRock bottom happens when profits dwindle , not when prices rise . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 4:08 pm | The sun coming up some 20 years ago should have been good enough reason for us to work toward reducing dependence on foreign oil . \nA crisis on the African continent wo n't change a thing except for possibly having to loose a few thousand more of Americas youth in order to de nationalize oil rich countries . \nWe are like pigs at the troth when it comes to oil consumption and that 's just the way the oil companies and their elected lackeys want us . \nBesides all that , how often have you seen the `` powers that be '' who run this country do what 's in our best national interest for a change ? \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 4:10 pm | 4000 American lives sacrificed for our occupation of Iraq and yet not a single drop of oil that flows from the earthen taps of Iraq enters a single U.S. port ! \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 4:13 pm | Boone Pickens will send us plenty of oil from Canada sand oil at about $ 5.00 a gallon . \nSarasota , Florida February 3 , 2011 at 4:14 pm | It should be , Jack , but you know the republicans will not allow it . \nThey are in the pockets of big oil and will not support anything other than their outlandish profits . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 4:20 pm | Jack , I think that the high price of gas per gallon should be more than enough to break our addiction to oil . \nGas prices are slated to go to $ 4 per gallon by late spring if not sooner . \nWe should have started kicking our oil addiction 40 years ago during the OPEC Oil Enbargo in the 1970 's . \nWe have another chance to do just that -- Take a page from Brazil !! Also , we can expedite the manufacture and sale of electric cars with fuel cells that regenerate power , eliminating the need to recharge our auto batteries from an electrical outlet . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 4:21 pm | Are you kiddin ' me Jack . \nBeing retired from a major oil company I can assure you we all got together once a week to figure out new ways to screw the public . \nAmerica 's so hooked on oil there 's not a politician in sight that could control the demand . \nThat includes the guy in the Oval Office . \nThis little `` dust-up '' in Egypt gives us just another opportunity to up the price at the pump . \nA drug addict does n't stop using just because the cartel has a few shakeups . \nThe only way the situation in the Middle East could break our addiction to foreign oil is if it spreads to the point where it severely impedes our supply , which does n't seem likely right now . \nBarring a massive `` eureka '' moment from conservatives , the only way our oil addiction will ever be cured is when we 're forced to go `` cold turkey '' , either by far greater turmoil in the Middle East , or when we simply run out . \nUnfortunately , we will suffer severe withdrawal pains if we wait that long . \nIt is absolutely vital that we break our addiction to foreign oil and maybe the unrest in the Middle East will push us in the right direction . \nNow , with an intelligent and educated President in the White House and , without two oil men in charge of our country , GW Bush and Cheney , we may have a chance to finally make some progress . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 4:27 pm | I certainly hope so . \nOur privilege should not be at the cost of freedom from the country 's it comes from . \nKathleen Parker , South Carolina Chaos in the Middle East SHOULD be enough to make any rational person push our government to `` fast track '' our own alternative energy programs . \nHowever , I am certain that once again , Big Oil and their Hired guns in Congress will spend millions of dollars to convince the clueless that such an energy program would be too expensive . \nWake up people , one way or another , expensive oil is coming and our way of life built on oil is going . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 4:30 pm | No , the chaos in the Middle East will not be the watershed event that ends the US 's dependency on oil . \nMost of the oil consumed in the United States comes from outside the Middle East , and the American public will not accept an immediate shift to alternative fuel sources . \nAt some point , Americans should begin a gradual transition to alternative fuel sources , but it will be one the government will support . \nPrivate individuals and companies are too stubborn to change . \n- Strom In Charleston , South Carolina February 3 , 2011 at 4:30 pm | No. . \nBut it damn sure better make our President step up and open up all drilling for oil & natural gas and get started on the 1st of many new nuclear power plants and oil refineries that are needed . \nNext , we need to see whatever O 's admin has done -LRB- if anything -RRB- on the new power grid design -- American citizens will not accept new taxes , cap-and-trade , or any such crap before they show us the new grid design and can explain -LRB- without passing legislation , first ! -RRB- \nhow it is going to work . \nThen , maybe Obama 's Sputnik moment can come in the way of developing solar\\/wind power generating devices so the average homeowner can put a few panels and spinners on his\\/her home and use actually some green power . \nWe will be using oil for the next 20 years even if the ` big green breakthrough ' happens tomorrow . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 4:32 pm | It should , Jack , but it probably wo n't . \nThe only way to break our addiction to imported oil is to use less oil . \nWe use oil because the cost of oil at the pump has been kept artificially low . \nOne major hidden cost we will the face if there is a major disruption is the fact that in the short term we have no alternative to oil . \nIf gas goes to $ 10 a gallon next month , we will be facing economic catastrophe . \nThe only way to use less oil is to slap a $ 1 per gallon tax on the stuff immediately , and raise that tax $ 1 a year forever . \nBut no politician has the guts to do that . \nAnd no , we can not produce enough domestic oil to `` drill our way out '' of the problem . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 4:45 pm | Does a heroin addict stop buying heroin because his dealer is having a family dispute ? \nForeign oil flows through our national veins like heroin in a junkie , so not only can we not stop , we will not be allowed to stop because they are addicted to our money the same way . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 4:46 pm | Of course it wo n't because the U.S. is already addicted to Canadian oil coming from our tar sands . \nAmericans should know that Canada is your single largest oil exporter . \nThey should also know that the oil industry is making a wasteland in that part of my country . \nThe whole world needs to take alternative energy sources much more seriously . \nLiving off fossil fuels indefinitely is unsustainable . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 4:48 pm | Get real Jack , its mostly accepted that the price of gas must reach the $ 7 or $ 8 per gallon range before that happens . \nAll this happy talk about green energy , electric cars , etc is just that ! \nIt will be a few decades before fossil fuels costs exceed that of alternative fuels . \nInfraustructure will have to be revamped , not just our `` addiction '' to fossil fuels . \nIf we had concentrated on making fossil fuels cleaner , and used technology to improve the use of fossil fuels , and too , prevent the environmental problems of fossil fuels , we would not be so dependent on foreign oil as we are today . \nThe U.S. dos n't need chaos in the middle east to be free a foreign oil all we have to do is us our own resourses , China and Vietnam are going to be drilling in the gulf of mexico for oil , but our goverment wo n't allow U.S. companies to drill there , costing our economy thousands of jobs and making us even more dependent on foreign oil , while all this stupidity is going on in Washington , the wise people in the last congress that could n't manage to pass a budget were able to come up with 10 billion dollars to give to Brasile to develope their offshore oil fields , in waters twice as deep as what we were drilling !! February 3 , 2011 at 5:01 pm | The Suez Canal does n't have much impact on US oil supplies . \nThe canal is too small for really big efficient supertankers , and even smaller ones have to pay over $ 300,000 in tolls , and then there are all the pirates at the south end of the Red Sea . \nAmerica needs to get serious about not funding terrorism and dictatorships . \nI think a $ 1 per gallon 9\\/11 tax is a good place to start , and it 's something our leaders should have had the guts to do nine years ago . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 5:10 pm | Not a chance Jack ! \nOur Corporate entities would never allow that to happen . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 5:14 pm | I am hopeful that the chaos in the Middle East will not only break America 's addiction to oil , but that we as a nation will finally pursue , in earnest , alternative fuels and formulate a comprehensive energy policy for our country . \nI am also , hopeful that we are learning that this country no longer can afford to allow partisan politics , race , gender , religion affiliations and sexual orientations to divide us as a Nation . \nThe chaos in the Middle East is a wake up call to America that we must be `` undivided '' ; that we must be `` United '' . \nWe must start to listen to the words in our pledge of allegiance to our flag , and then we must practice those words in our day to day living in this country . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 5:16 pm | I understand that the Paris HIlton of politics is organizing a giant Moose , Polar Bear and environmentalist hunt to clear the Alaskan oil fields of obstacles to oil drilling , as we speak . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 5:18 pm | If the Suez were blocked and tankers had to round the Horn of Africa , the Somali pirates would become some the weathiest people on the continent . \nOf course it is past time to break our dependenceon Middle East oil . \nWe could produce fuel from coal ; the Germans did just that during WWII ; a fact petrochemical companies want us to forget . \nThe U.S. has the largest coal supplies on Earth . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 5:18 pm | February 3 , 2011 at 5:18 pm | We can only hope so , but as long as the republicans are getting their pockets stuffed with money from big oil it will never happen , same as the wars we 're in , to much defense industry money going to the republicans to stop the war . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 5:24 pm | They pay $ 7 a gallon for gas in England . \nOther countries pay way more than we do . \nIt will take gas prices rising to these levels to begin to break our addiction . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 5:28 pm | I hope so . \nIt will force our country to become inventive and create newer and better efficient cars , heating and cooling etc. . \nIt 's time for our government to return to building America for their tax payers . \nOr the `` I want change '' will be come larger and louder with every generation . \nsounds a little familiar . \nMaybe , `` it is time '' for our government to read the handwriting on the wall . \nMaybe instead of addressing Pres. Obama we should address it too congress February 3 , 2011 at 5:29 pm | Jack , once we attain 20 % unemployment we will relax our dependence on gas and oil . \nMight be cheaper in the long run and save lives if we isolate this country from the interests of big business . \nNatural gas in the way to go , period . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 5:31 pm | Give me a break ! \nIf I 'm not mistaken most of our oil comes frfom Canada , Mexico and wells in the gulf of Mexico . \nMost of The oil brought in from the Middle East is refined here and exported to countries that do not have refining capabilities -LRB- like Iran -RRB- . \nRemaining an oil dependent nation puts us in a highly enviable position . \nWhen the oil runs out and we do n't have an alternative we will ... Drastically cut our carbon footprint . \nAir polution will disappear almost over night . \nBecome much healthier as a nation from all the exercise we get from walking to work . \nWe will eat healthier from eating produce grown in our back yards . \nExperience significant economic growth in carriage making , saddle making and other related local industries . \nIt can only be win-win for us . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 5:37 pm | In one word no. . \nGive it all the lip service you want , we do n't have a plan . \nWe do n't drill , the white house only wants to regulate the issue even if we go broker as a country . \nThey want expensive gas and will use green house gases as their excuse . \nThey only want us to look to them for all the answers , while limiting our movements . \nAnd guess what the politicians will still fly around in their jets telling us how bad things are and what they can do to help . \nI 've heard it all before . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 5:38 pm | It should , but it wo n't , sadly . \nJust think , years ago we could have been the leaders in all things energy efficient . \nNow it looks like China will lead the way . \nGotta love those oil and energy lobbyists in DC doing what 's best for their bottom line instead of what 's best for the US . \nSame tune , different day . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 5:39 pm | We have lots of oil in u.s. . \nWe are just saving it while we use other people 's supply . \nOf course at the same time some are demanding to be able to find new supplies wherever there is dirt or water . \nAs long as we have a system where chaos increases the bottom line of international corporations nothing is going to change the oil economic system . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 5:41 pm | February 3 , 2011 at 5:43 pm | I think it is not a problem . \nIt is all about greed . \nThe people are Muslims , so it make a certain amount of sense to be governed by a Muslim leadership -LRB- surprise ! -RRB- . \nAs soon as they discover the benefits of making profits off the oil and canal shipping they will quickly become vested members of the international community , and maintain the flow of oil . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 5:43 pm | My home solar panel blew away in the blizzard . \nTo keep from litterly freezing to death I am burning lot 's of firewood and using lots of natural gas to keep me warm . \nIronically , deep water drilling in the Gulf of Mexico provided gobs of domestic oil . \nAs you know , it has been gone now for about 6 months . \nPossibly we should forget about building a Disney world in Anwar , Alaska 'cause our dependence on oil is going up , whether domestic or foreign . \nYeah '' it should , but will the Republicans and the oil companies which they support see it from that perspective . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 5:45 pm | Jack I like too know what the worlds attitude will be toward the middle east when theres no longer any oil to suck out of their sand ? \nSomething tells me they will get the ultimate cold shoulder . \nBeside headachs and oil , the world gets very little from that area . \nWhen oil producing countries have no oil to pacify the worlds thirst , but have access to nukes , I wonder how long before blackmail starts to become the next big thing ! \nChaos in the middle east started before Christ was born . \nIt doesn ; t help that the Jews and Palestinian have been fighting over control of the same piece of land for nearly a century . \nWhy did we start a war in Iraq ? \nWhy did we overthrow the elected government of Iran ? \nWho is running this country ? \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 5:49 pm | And what would be our alternative ? \nYou forget that there are places that are NOT served by public transportation . \nWe moved here in 1948 , how long should we wait for the bus to the county seat ? \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 5:52 pm | You would think so , but it wo n't happen . \nI remember as a kid the oil embargo of the early 70 's . \nIt did n't cause any change in the ` car ' culture of the U.S. at that time either . \nEven a few years back when oil was above $ 125 a barrel and gas prices averaging almost $ 4.00 per gallon it did n't cause a fundamental shift . \nNope , the U.S. wo n't wake up till it is way way too late . \nNothing will change until the hold by the oil industry on our politicians and country is broken . \nBut even then we are behind the curve in comparison to other countries in electric cars and alternative energy sources . \nSad thing is we invented alot of that technology here , and now we are piddling it away . \nJack , if the thousands that have died in Iraq has not broken us . \nWhat makes you think chaos in the middle east will be enough to break us ? \nWhat makes my blood boil is the Trillions we have sent to the Middle East to people who absolutely hate every thing we stand for ! \nJust think where we would be now if we spent those trillions of dollars on electric cars and the infrastructure to go along with them . \nInstead of and electric car that only goes 100 miles on a charge , we might have one that would go 300 miles . \nIts like the US is dating the ugliest girl\\/guy in the world just because their daddy is filthy rich ! \nIts time to move on ! \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 5:54 pm | Of course not , not this Egyptian crisis anyway . \nEven when gas hits $ 5 bucks a gallon we will grouse and complain but we 'll still drive ... maybe less driving . \nI cut back on driving 3 years ago and have only driven 42 miles per week since then . \nI used to drive a few hundred so I 'm saving money everyday . \nTruth is we have no solution to quickly replace the oil problem ... we just try to tell ourselves we do . \nMaybe we should grow more corn for ethanol so more people can starve ? \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 5:55 pm | I doubt if we will but the US should have more choices . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 5:57 pm | Jack , Nothing is going to break oils grip on our country . \nIf everything we know and has happened so far has n't done it , then nothing will . \nWhen the price of gas goes up , it only hurts the poor and middle class who are just trying to support themselves and their families . \nWe have had the technology for alternative energy for many years , and we only pay lip service to it . \nThe electric car is a catch 22 . \nDo we burn more coal or build nuclear plants to keep up with the huge increase in electric we will need if everyone goes to electric ? \nWe are always going to be sucking at the Middle East oil teat . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 6:03 pm | It should . \nWe are supposed to be so smart but sometimes I think that we are slow learners . \nRead the writing on the wall already ! \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 6:04 pm | If the price of gas goes up to four dollars a gallon it will bring our economy to it 's knees and we will go strait into another depression and Obama will be toast in 2012 . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 6:11 pm | Jack , not even a 12 step program could get us off of foreign Oil . \nThat 's just not the American way , we will stay addicted to anything as long as it makes us feel better about our lives , just ask the Tobacco Industry February 3 , 2011 at 6:13 pm | No , it is not enough . \nWe have to be anywhere we think can sell us their oil . \nIt makes sense for our strategic interest . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 6:17 pm | That whole question is really insane this country is not addicted to oil it is totally dependent on oil we in no way prepared to survive without it our country will be crushed . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 6:17 pm | February 3 , 2011 at 6:17 pm | No , it will not break America 's addiction to foreign oil . \nAmerica is to fat and lazy ... February 3 , 2011 at 6:18 pm | Chris ftom Toronto . . \nYou folks need to remember !! the majority of your OIL and Gnatural gas you consume comes from CANADA February 3 , 2011 at 6:18 pm | That would be nice , Jack . \nToo bad you worked so hard to help elect Republicans who will do anything for the oil industry , even if it hurts the country . \nAs Wolf pointed out , we 've been talking about ending our reliance on foreign oil for more than 30 years from now . \nSadly , based on the lack of leadership in Washington D.C. , the USA will be addicted to oil until the last drop is squeezed out of the desert . \nProvided , of course , China does n't buy it first . \nShould it yes , will it no. . \nWhen politicans are more enthralled with trying to keep the President from doing anything and trying to reform healthcare we have no chance of an actual debate to try to kick our habbit . \nLike you said this has been a topic for 30 years and will be for probably another 30 . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | Not gonna happen . \nMany Americans do n't even know there is turmoil in Egypt . \nAnd our politicians are too indebted to the oil money to rock the boat . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | February 3 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | Should it be enough ? \nWill it be enough ? \nIt seems we 're happier to complain than make the difficult decisions to remove ourselves from foreign dependence . \nNatural gas , offshore drilling or solar panels , I do n't care ! \nLet 's do all of it and make America strong again ! \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | The Pentagon , military industrial complex and the multinational corporations that own our elected officials and run our country will never let that happen , Jack . \n-LRB- see Los Angeles during the 30s 40s and 50s -RRB- They 're all more interested in profits than in anything that is best for human beings . \nThey convinced half the country that war is better than peace , illness is more profitable than health , and our addiction to petroleum is the monkey on our back that will make them richer than ever . \nThere are no more leaders of by and for the American people , Jack . \nEspecially when it comes to protecting and increasing their profits . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 6:24 pm | We in the US are not addicted to oil . \nMost people want a cleaner , more effecient energ . \nIt 's just the need for oil is forced upon us by our governemnt and their corparate masters . \nThe combination of bank debt of oil producing nations , coupled with big oil interests are whats behind our system of burning as much oil as possible . \nAfter all , this is the culture of greed . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 6:25 pm | Are you kidding ? \nIt 's so obvious to this old lady that too many Amrican citizens do n't pay much attention to the world news . \nIt 's all about sports like the coming event this Sunday . \nWhere I live it 's like a National Holiday ... the Super Bowl . \nI know of some who think of others and try to help as much as they can in these ` tight economical ' times ... good people . \nBUT I reallly do n't know what would have to happen to have many Americans ` do the ` right thing ' . \nI 'm afraid there are too many selfish , spoiled and ignorant people out there . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 6:25 pm | Although it would still be considered a foreign oil supply for the USA the Athabasca oil sands is a solution to American dependence on at least foreign oil from corrupt dictatorships and unstable nations . \nThe supply of oil that can come from Canada is enough to supply all of North America for the century , but at the moment we are unfortunately seeing more investment into Canadian oil from the Chinese then the USA . \nWe will pay whatever price appears at the pump . \nI believe Americans should get used to riding MASS TRANSIT or buy a DAMN BIKE !!!!!!!!!!!!! America get ready to open up your wallets !!!!! February 3 , 2011 at 6:25 pm | As long as our politicians worry more about getting re-election money from big oil than doing what is right for our country , we will be addicted to oil , probably until oil runs out . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 6:25 pm | An oil company will soon be in the process of testing a new process for effectively extracting clean oil from shale in Kentucky . \nThe process will allow the production of unbelievable amounts of North American oil . \nThere 's enough oil shale in Canada and the U.S. to get us off foreign oil . \nLet 's take advantage of that resource first , and we can get off oil altogether later . \nWe are the ONLY nation without an Energy Plan ! \nWe 've had our head in the sand -LRB- and other places -RRB- since the Oil Embargo of ' 73 ... why is this going to be any different ? \n\\* sigh \\* February 3 , 2011 at 6:25 pm | What percentage of our oil is from the Middle East ? \nDo n't see the U.S. trying to break the dependency , especially with the support they give to Middle Eastern allies like Egypt . \nI especially do n't think our country and its citizens has the capacity to sacrifice the standard of living we have enjoyed . \nSoon we will not have a choice , however . \nThis is only the beginning and I do n't see it getting better any time soon . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 6:25 pm | Your problem is not about foreign oil , but simply oil in general . \nThe current major exporter of oil to the USA is Canada . \nYou will always need foreign oil until you make major changes to your dependence on oil . \nRenewal energy is the only way to go if you look longterm , rather than the next spike in gasoline prices or international crisis . \nOh please , Jack . \nThe Tea Party still needs their SUVs to carry all their ammo and guns , because the 2nd amendment tells them it is the right thing to do . \nNo , their elected neglected to read about the forefathers considering anything not in their progeny to be 3\\/5ths a person when the constitution was recently read in congress . \nBut , this revolt is about the 3\\/5ths and the Tea Party is confused . \nWhat 's the fuss ? \nThey just need to fill up their SUV . \nThey do n't care where the gas comes from . \nJust get it here . \nI 'm just a 60-percentor . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 6:26 pm | Should it ? \nNot a chance . . \nUnless we fundamentally change the way we create , produce , accept and implement newer technology . \nI fear we will be slaves to the Middle East for the balance of my lifetime and those of the next generation . \nBut boy it would be nice to see how long it takes the Middle East to change its tune if we stopped all need for its oil . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 6:26 pm | Stop calling us oil addicts . \nFor the average working Joe 's , what are the alternatives to foreign oil ? \nOther than major cities , the US has no decent mass transit . \nStop blaming the worker bees and do n't call us addicts . \nWe hate going to the pumps because we are sadly aware that every $ 40 tank of gas supports our dependence . \nThe wealthy corporations may be the addicts . \nThis wo n't break their addiction if they make more profits . \nOf course we should do whatever we need to do to get off foreign oil -- and begin to replace it with nuclear energy . \nTom Friedman went through all the arguments in his book , `` Hot , Flat and Crowded '' several years ago , in which he accurately describes America 's energy future as `` electric . '' \nIf our politicians can find the guts to cut the hose , we will not only be energy independent , we will deprive those Islamic lunatics of their most potent weapon -- our money . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 6:26 pm | ever since the nixon doctrine , you guys have been relying on israel to do the dual job of dividing egypt geographically from other arabs to keep them from grouping and forming some regional power , as well as act as your agent to help you control the massive oil reserves of the middle east . \nit is precisely this control over world oil supplies that enables the US to be a super power -LRB- by constituting just above 20 % of the world 's gross production of goods using the energy you get out of it -RRB- . \ni.e. the US will lose this addiction the day it loses world domination . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 6:26 pm | Jack , we have had enough of thier oil . \nlets be fair and keep the remaining for those youth who share the same dreams of our own natoin . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 6:26 pm | The only way that the addiction would be broken is if the suez canal was closed for an extended period of time and gas prices were driven up to over $ 5 a gallon . \nWith the knowlege that soaring gas prices could come anytime , the funding for altewrnitive fuel resecrch would skyrocket . \nThis should have been done years ago , -LRB- as in the 90 's -RRB- but the outcome still might have mixed blessings . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 6:26 pm | I do n't think that this will break Americas dependency on foreign oil . \nI think that everyday Americans are blind to the fact that we depend on these nations -LRB- The Middle East -RRB- to supply so much of our oil . \nEveryday Americans are focused on Health Care reform and tax cuts more than they are concerned about oil and rising prices . \nAmericans also do not see how much we depend on the Middle East for oil , we see commercials about clean oil here in America but not the oil that we get from the Middle East . \nForeign oil is not the top item President Obama 's agenda and it should be due to the events in Egypt and Middle East happening . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 6:26 pm | Americans are an independent people with the exception of oil . \nThe only way your going to get Americans off of oil is to outlaw it or come up with a cheaper thing to put in their vehicles . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 6:26 pm | This situation in the Middle East is nothing but a great opportunity for speculators and oil companies to make more money . \nArab countries have nothing to do it . \nYou ought to take a serious look at who is really exploiting American people and the rest of the world . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 6:26 pm | Do you honestly think the `` Bush 's '' of the world are going to roll over and let this happen ? \nThis should have happened 40 years ago and not as a result of access or lack thereof to a canal ! \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 6:26 pm | I have a geothermally-heated house , and my electricity is solar-generated . \nI have my own well . \nI used reclaimed materials in constructing the house , and I conscientiously recycle . \nAnd yet I drive many thousands of miles per year -- my greatest environmental sin , and an addiction that 's hard to break when your family is spread all over the country . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 6:26 pm | That will solve our dependency of foreign oil . \nWhen you are starving you do n't run out and try to invent how to grow some new kind of food and harvest it . \nYou simply look for a source of what you need that is available ... Now ! \nYou can work on your experimental projects all you want when you do n't have the immediate need . \nI really hate to hear over and over that Americans have an addiction to oil . \nThe technology to relieve the country of this so called addiction has been in place for a long time . \nIf the alternatives were readily available people would respond by using them . \nYes , this has been a problem since the 70 's and it has been only been given a small amount of attention . \nBut , I resent that it is called America 's addiction to oil . \nLet us definie it for what it is ... big oil companies and oil lobbiests and congress in cahoots for profit . \nIt is way past time to do something serious about this problem . \nHopefully , we have not waited to long at this point ! \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 6:27 pm | It should be but wo n't be as history over the last 60 years has dictated . \nTo change our way of life , a way that is based partially on gluttony and lack of self control , is the same way it has always been , hit the pocket book and unite through hardship are the ways we seem to find self discipline . \nThe only way we will be rid of Mideast oil is a strict cap and trade law that will initiate strong ingenuity and creativity , and\\/or a total blockade of oil from the Mideast by the Mideast . \nDo we as a society have the stomach for either ? \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 6:27 pm | As long American big corporations continue to make huge profits , forget it . \nThey have lobbysts in Washington to thwart any good intentions . \nOthers will claim , it will kill jobs in America . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 6:27 pm | As long as our politicians worry more about getting re-election money from big oil than doing what is right for our country , we will be addicted to oil , probably until oil runs out . \nThe answer is simple : break off our dependence on Mideast Oil and use natural gas . \nNorth America has stockpiles of natural gas in storage . \nIt is a more affordable alternative . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 6:27 pm | The issue is not `` addiction to foreign oil , '' the issue is `` addiction to oil . '' \nWhy are we addicted to oil ? \nThree reasons : Because we refuse to reduce consumption and we refuse to have fewer children and we refuse to green our economy . \nIf each woman had one child and if we did n't consume things we do n't need and if we insisted that all energy be green , we would not only solve the `` oil problem , '' we 'd also solve global warming and destruction of biodiversity and world hunger , etc. . \nI 've come to assume that most people in the USA are incapable of cultural change , are incapable of caring about other species , and are incapable of caring about other people , It 's sad . \nThe elites at the top are the worst when it comes to consumption . \nWhat is the carbon footprint of a rich child in the USA ? \nDo people even consider their carbon legacy ? \nMurtagh at OSU did this research . \nIt 's not just about foreign oil consumption , it 's about the number of children we choose to have and our level of consumption and our trampling on `` the rights '' of other species as well . \n~ Tara Waters Lumpkin February 3 , 2011 at 6:27 pm | It is definitely wishful thinking . \nEvery time there is a crisis in the middle east , our dependence on foreign oil is brought to the table . \nPeople go into a panic as gas prices rise , and ideas , some wonderful , are kicked around for a few days . \nThen , our new oil shipments from Venezuela or Brazil come in , and everyone returns to old habits . \nMy , how I would love to see the day come , Jack , but I do n't think that it 's today . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 6:27 pm | You should go back and count the number of times you have asked `` Will -LRB- Blank -RRB- be enough to push us to end our addiction to foreign oil ? '' \nThe answer is simple . \nWhen we stop electing republicans , we will end our addiction to oil . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 6:28 pm | It should be enough to break our addiction , but that should have been done long ago . \nIf we do n't get oil from the Middle East , Venezuela , and Russia then what . \nWe do n't have plans in place to make that kind of change . \nWe need these resources considering that green energies account for less than 10 % of our power needs -LRB- electric cars still need power plants for electricity -RRB- We have oil , natural gas , coal , plus solar , wind , and hydro power here in the US , but the government strangles our own innovators . \nWe have enough resources and enough American ingenuity right here to solve these problems if the government would allow the people to work . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 6:28 pm | Not yet Jack . \nOil companies pour a lot of money in our politics . \nThey will control the message & spin the same as the Heath Care industry did . \nNot until there is a major attack on Isreal , or something of that magnitude , will the U.S. take turn on energy . \nI 'm glad Obama is already focusing on green energy now , as opposed to waiting until crude oil being $ 200 a barrel . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 6:28 pm | February 3 , 2011 at 6:29 pm | The Pickens Plan is the way to go . \nI 've been pushing for this like crazy . \nwe simply need to convert our transportation fuel to natural gas . \nall vehicles can be easily converted -- many Taxi and Utility company already have -LRB- why ? -RRB- \nit 's cheap , readily available and cleaner burning than gasoline . \nthe infrastructure is already in place . \nwe as a nation have over a 100 year supply . \nit will bridge the gap between oil and whatever comes next . \nif President Obama would simply sign a one sentence executive order stating all new cars purchased by the federal govt run on natural gas , it would instantly create jobs and drop the price of gasoline in half . \nlike giving the nation a raise in wages and eliminate the dependence on foreign oil it 's a win win win deal the problem is this idea is too right and thats why it wo n't get done and it could be done tomorrow February 3 , 2011 at 6:29 pm | Its a bogus question , Jack , There 's no such thing as `` foreign '' oil . \nOil is oil , we do n't own a drop of it in the USA . \nWe lease our domestic oil fields to privately owned oil companies like BP for millions in exchange for their ownership of any oil they find . \nThe only oil we own is what we have in our strategic reserves and we buy that on the futures market . \nThere 's not one single Government owned producing oil well in the United States . \nAll the drilling that 's done here is by oil companies and they own all they oil they bring up . \nThe ONLY way to end our dependence on `` foreign '' oil is to end our dependence on all oil . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 6:29 pm | Good topic Jack . \nThis why in Europe everybody prefer a small car . \nBesides , if politician think for a moment about the country , a gasoline tax could help to balance the budge and save the planet , but do n't count on that . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 6:29 pm | Oil is no longer needed for energy no matter what Royal Dutch Shell , BP or the Saudis might have you believe ... oil is a commodity to be traded like gold , copper or wheat . \nIf you want the answer to your questions ask a representative of Goldman Sacks or Morgan Stanley ... anyway you look at it , the American Consumer gets screwed every time the world does not move our way ... if anyone honestly wanted to protect themselves from `` oil barons , '' they would put their money where their mouth is , like I did in 2005 when gas hit 2 dollars a gallon , I bought a Toyota Prius . \n-LRB- Insert hybrid car here , if you do not want to permute a brand . -RRB- \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 6:29 pm | No it will not break our addiction . \nWe Have powerful domestic oil money preventing legislation which would move the US toward breaking oil dependency . \nExxon made too much money to see US government try to curb US consumption . \nAs a result of the legislative power of big US oil companies , we buy vast quantities of foreign oil and subsidize domestic production . \nIf we want to beat the addiction to `` foreign '' oil , stop the corrupt practice in Washington of bribery in the form of campaign contributions . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 6:29 pm | Sadly , the deadly combination of our addiction to oil and the power of the venal and greedy oil executives over the members of congress tells me to answer your question with a clear `` no '' . \nLet 's not forget who calls the shots in this plutocracy of ours and it is n't President Obama . \nDefinitely , it is not in the best interest of the oil companies to encourage the development of alternative sources of energy . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 6:29 pm | The Chaos in the Middle East will not have an impact on the United States addiction to Middle Eastern oil . \nEqually impactful crisis like the oil embargo , the Iranian crisis , and subsequent wars with Middle Eastern countries did not dampened our appetite for their oil . \nI think this hiccup in foreign policy geared towards the Middle East should be approached from an angle that addresses the spread of radicalism and terrorism more as the immediate danger to the United States . \nIf like a cancer , the chaos in this region spreads , then we can talk about America s addiction to foreign oil . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 6:30 pm | Addiction to foreign oil did not cause the price per barrel to rise to over $ 100.00 , speculators did purely for greed . \nThe shipment of oil through the Suez Canal has not been hindered . \nSpeculators are always looking for any chance to put the screws to the people . \nI 'm sure the new Republican Congress is celebrating their new fortunes from our misery . \nWhy does that not surprise me . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 6:30 pm | Hey Jack , up here in Canada we have in our western provinces a stable supply of oil , given the present rate of consumption that will last for 300 years ! \nyour energy needs can be found a lot closer to home . \nthink of us like Americans without guns , and hey were friendly ! \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 6:31 pm | It is disheartening to hear your concern about your gas prices while Egyptians are dying to make ends meet . \nMy question is how come all the oil in the Mideast have not been influential in pressuring the U.S to stop Israel from building settlements in Israel February 3 , 2011 at 6:31 pm | the Middle East conflict should be a wake up call for America to break the addiction to foreign oil . \ni have already started to take this matter into my own hands and had a 6kw solar panel system installed on the roof of my home . \nmy electric meter spins backwards on sunny days . \nIts very rewarding to know i help supply energy to the grid . \nSolar Power , Wind Power , Fuel Cells Energy , Flywheel Technology , come on America lets get going , lets take charge of our energy needs now and for our future . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 6:31 pm | In a perfect world , America and the rest of the world would be able to kick the addiction of crude oil . \nThis is very far from a perfect world . \nIt is not just America that is addicted to oil ; every country is addicted to oil . \nThe problem does not stop there ; however , the big problem in this picture is the corporate greed that comes with the addiction . \nIf America and the rest of the world can not break the addiction to greed , then we wo n't be able to break the addiction to oil . \nIt is corporate greed that is increasing the price of oil , the price of gasoline , and ultimately : the price of all necessities . \nMy answer to your question would be no. . \nThe price of oil will continue to spike , and we will continue to pay for it by shelling money out at the pumps , as well as for basic necessities . \nWe 've seen oil prices rise in excess of $ 147 per barrel . \nI believe we should be prepared for prices to rise to $ 175 , or even $ 200 per barrel . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 6:31 pm | The chaos in the Middle East will not be enough to end our dependence on foreign oil . \nTruth be told , we should have ended it 40 years ago . \nHowever , our government has done nothing but prop up the regimes which are responsible for much of the unrest . \nWe citizens will be upset for a little while then we 'll cry for an alternative energy source . \nObama will make some shallow speech , then it will all go away quietly . \nSadly , our attention spans are short and we 'll be sidetracked by something else , like latest Palin rant , or questions about Obama 's bowel movements , or indicting the latest Ponzi schemer . \nWhat are we doing with the huge natural gas discoveries within our borders ? \nWe 're selling the gas to someone else . \nLet the madness continue ! \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 6:31 pm | I am from Romania but I leave most of the time in US , just want to tell you that this is just another reason to finally break the US addiction to the foreign oil and stop making these dictators richer . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 6:31 pm | Now is the time to drill for oil here at home . \nThe President needs to lift all drilling restrictions -LRB- instant jobs and economic growth -RRB- and begin a project to drill in Anwar !! Now ! \nReopen all closed nuclear plants to power the country ! \nRenewable energy makes up less than 10 % of the total energy usage in the US now . \nIt is impossible to make this move to green energy anytime soon . \nStart drilling for Natural Gas and begin to make the shift from oil resources in the Middle East . \nThis would also stop he dirty business of supporting bad regimes . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 6:32 pm | What are you talking about ? \nAmerica gets of its oils supply from Canada . \nDo you think Canadian oil goes though Suez Canal before it reaches the U. S ? \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 6:32 pm | It ` s not only the oil producing countries . \nOur own oil companies are involved in the pricing at the pump . \nWhenever we start to talk seriously about alternative energy sources , they simply reduce the price and , once again , make oil the cheapest option . \nLet ` s face it , Jack . \nThey ` ve got us over a barrel . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 6:32 pm | The oil lobby owns the republicans , and the oil lobby benefits when the price of oil goes up . \nThe republicans control the house , so no , we wo n't end our addiction to oil -- foreign or otherwise . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 6:32 pm | I hope chaos makes a lot of people switch to electric , hybrid or alternatively fueled cars . \nI hope it heralds the return of electric or alternatively fueled public transportation and the return of passenger trains . \nBig Oil has had the USA in a stranglehold for way too long . \nUsing as many alternatives to Big Oil and being as energy self-sufficient as possible should n't be considered `` sissy '' or `` left-wing '' but part of our patriotic duty as Americans . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 6:32 pm | I have visions of oil filled syringe needles being inserted into Uncle Sam 's veins . \nThe oil addiction of this country is too deep of a problem and will not end . \nIt seems as if we ca n't live without it . \nUnfortunately , unrest in Egypt will not stop the demand . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 6:33 pm | Yes !! But why is everybody talking about electric cars which can only go 40 miles on a charge -LRB- if you do n't want to run the A\\/C , radio or lights -RRB- ? \nWe could grow our fuel in the form of biofuels . \nThe distribution infrastructure is already in place and farmers and oil companies could make a fortune . \nBrazil has done it and they are off foreign oil -LRB- they use sugar -RRB- . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 6:33 pm | I disagree , it is about the money . \nIt 's about the people and companies who get rich off oil . \nCan you break their addiction to money ? \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 6:33 pm | Come on Jack , safe your breath . \nThis situation has occurred before and the American people went back to wasting gas and forgetting about alternative sources once the situations went away . \nNuclear power , clean coal , waste-to-energy plants , natural gas exploration and others have been forgotten by the liberals . \nWhat we need is for the liberals to write some more books on the theory of energy independence . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 6:34 pm | It would be great not to send all that money to the Middle East for oil . \nBut it will be that way for some time , even if green technology expands at the rosiest of predictions . \nHowever , one way we could almost immediately deflate the cost of oil , and send less money over there , is to allow expanded drilling in the U.S. , including offshore . \nJust the announcement that we were going to aggressively pursue our own energy sources , including natural gas , would slow or reverse oil price increases and make us less dependent on the Middle East , and Venezuela . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 6:34 pm | Should it ? \nYes , of course . \nNo , of course . \nThere is simply no viable alternative to the public anytime soon to allow us to switch from oil . \nI 'm sure all Americans that do not have a direct vested interest in the oil industry would switch in a nano second if they could . \nBut we ca n't . \nWe have been raped for decades by the greedy , money-sucking OPEC slime bags , along with our own oil industry executives and political puppets who are all beholden to the oil industry . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 6:34 pm | Sorry Jack , have you not yet noticed that the Mid\\/east problem is simply ` racist ' . \nEgypt , Yemen , Somalia , Algeria , Yemen , Somalia , Niger , etc. - -- are all governed by a ruling elite of Arab descent . . \nTheir ` indineggess ' people are AFRICAN . \n!!! Sorry ... . . \n!! The general Arab concept is that the are destined to ` use ' ` black ' people , ... . \nlook at Saudi Arabia , or any Emirate . \nHow many americans remain addicted to illegal drugs and alcohol ? \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 6:36 pm | It should definitely be enough to break America 's use of foreign oil and it may even be incentive to create more American jobs to help convert the country to using wind and solar energy as its primary source . \nIt would be cheaper once implemented and we would only depend on the innovation of the American people , and of course mother nature . \nDepending on other nations for our energy resources and going further into debt , or relying on whether the sun is going to come up or the wind blow . \nIf Obama is really about ` change ' , he might find a way to relieve our debt , and not having to rely on others for oil may give journalists less reason to have to go into such dangerous situations . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 6:36 pm | we need USA and other countries to buy our oil in Iraq and other meddle east country so we could use this income to develop and improve the life of ordinary people , however USA should change their tactics politically rather than economic interest , i hope Egypt stay as an scalier country other ways we all are a loser if Islamic extremist come to power Jack , very high gas prices will break our addiction to oil . \nGas prices are slated to be $ 4 a gallon by late spring of this year . \nWe squandered the opportunity to free ourselves from this addiction when the 1970 Oil Enbargo was imposed against the U.S. by OPEC nations -- Arab oil producing states . \nWe should take a page from Brazil , which is independent of petroleum . \nWe have another chance to finally start freeing ourselves of this curse . \nWe are starting to manufacture celluar fusion electric cars and make greater use of solar technology and natural gas . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 6:37 pm | Not as long as Obama is president . \nHe talks out of both sides of his mouth !! Always watch what he does , not what he says . \nIt 's just like jobs , if he was really serious about getting our unemployed back to work , we would not still be importing 75 + k foreign workers a month and we would not have 8 million illegals still working . \nHE CAN NOT BE TRUSTED EITHER !! February 3 , 2011 at 6:39 pm | I am perplexed by the question . \nSo what if it is enough ?? What 's the alternative ?? The only alternative has and it has always been that Americans have to lessen our need and dependency on foreign oil , or oil in general by pouring money into R&D for alternative energy sources , alternative heating and cooling systems , alternative transportation , and more efficient use of the current systems that we have in place . \nDrilling in the Artic National Widelife Refuge , or allowing more off-shore oil wells in the gulf ... . \nIs definitely not the answer . \nSo what is happening in Egypt should not be a wake up call . \nOur wake up call happend during the Oil Embargo and look how little we achieved . \nA greater crisis than the Northern African Revolutions will be needed for Americans to change their habits . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 6:39 pm | In the U : S : states of nort and south Dakota we have over 2000 years of untapped oil reserves but environmentalists are keeping us from getting it . \nWhen we tap indto this oik the prce is expected to come down to $ 16 per barrel . \nThe U : S : will be the biggest exporter of oil in the world and the Saudis and OOPEC will be oudt of business as will ALL offshore oil drilling . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 6:40 pm | We need alternative transportation choices ! \nHere in East Tenn. . \nI bike everywhere & feel like i stick out like a sore thumb because strangers come up to me to say they see me biking everywhere ... guess that is how rare I am . \nPeople need to get out of their cars & find other options . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 6:41 pm | There is a pending -LRB- 3years -RRB- patent for a pollution free engine which would solve all the industries problems and the global warming danger by using Hydrogen in this engine . \nIt is designed to supply Residential Individual generation for homes and businesses along with all engine powered devises and will solve all the nations road congestion . \nAll America needs to do is eliminate the oil industry 's control over allowing this patent from being approved . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 6:41 pm | During WWII we retooled our factories and created the military industrial complex . \nNow , we should retool all the factories that produce fighter planes that we do n't need or use and have them produce wind turbines and solar panels . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 6:42 pm | This is the USA 's opportunity to make Egypt aware that we rather walk than be held hostage for gas . \nWhy should we succumb to their insanity per a dictator . \nMass transit people ... . \ninfrastucture would result in JOBS people !!!!!

'' \nThe central Cairo plaza transformed from a bloody battleground to the scene of a largely peaceful political rally dubbed `` Day of Departure '' as Egyptians gave embattled President Hosni Mubarak until the end of the day to relinquish power . \nProtesters did not get their wish and thousands remained in the square well into the night , defying a curfew that has been widely ignored . \nHeavy gunfire was heard in and around Tahrir Square . \nAmong the demonstrators were the secretary-general of the Arab League and the spokesman for the largest center of Sunni Muslim learning , two men representing pillars of authority . \nAttempts to defuse the crisis , meanwhile , were halting but ongoing . \nGovernment brass had signaled a wish to meet with opposition leaders but those talks have not yet gained traction , a senior U.S. official told CNN Friday . \nVice President Omar Suleiman 's offer to meet opposition groups fell flat , said the official , who did not want to be identified because of the sensitivity of the rapidly evolving situation . \nNo key opposition leaders showed up . \nCNN ordered not to film Egypt protests At a glance : Nations facing unrest That opposition , a disparate group of at least six factions and political groups nominally headed by Nobel laureate Mohamed ElBaradei , is still `` jockeying , '' the official said , hedging their bets on how events will play out . \nSome have refused to negotiate until Mubarak steps down . \n`` The so-called dialogue is the first step to exhaust this revolution . \nThe president must go , '' said Mohammed Habib , deputy chairman of the Muslim Brotherhood , an opposition Islamist group officially banned by the government . \nSome opposition parties that had previously refused to meet with government officials , however , told CNN Friday they have agreed to meet with Suleiman on Saturday . \nRefat Said , head of the left-leaning Tagammuparty , said his group will meet with the vice president , as will the liberal Wafd party . \nAyman Nour , head of the al-Ghad party , said members of his group will decide soon on whether they will accept the government 's invitation to meet . \n`` Based on promises that the government gave us that they will investigate into the Tahrir Square clashes , we agreed to meet tomorrow , '' said Fouad Badrawi , secretary-general of the Wafd party . \nAnd 19 men , including veteran diplomat Amre Moussa , have formed a so-called `` Committee of the Wise '' in a bid to calm the crisis . \nThe group of independents , which wants to be at the table during crucial government talks , has called for Mubarak to remain as a symbolic leader and to delegate to Suleiman responsibility for the transition period . \nDay 11 of the uprising was mostly jubilant in Cairo 's downtown square , but tensions remained high . \nIn another plaza just half a kilometer away from Tahrir Square , supporters and foes of Mubarak fought running street battles . \nYouths wielding sticks and rocks engaged in fights and the sound of gunfire rang out . \nThe Muslim Brotherhood reported that a security force accompanied by a `` gang of thugs '' stormed the office of its news website Friday and arrested the journalists , technicians and administrators . \nThe satellite news network Al-Jazeera reported a similar attack on its Cairo office . \nThose attacks came after two days of violence and a government crackdown on journalists and human rights activists bearing witness to the crisis . \nSome had predicted the demonstrations might lose their momentum . \nThat was hardly the case as anti-government protesters jammed TahrirSquare chanting slogans like `` He leaves , we do n't leave '' and `` The blood of the martyrs will not be forgotten . '' \nA massive banner in the middle of the square said in English : `` The people demand the removal of the regime . '' \nThe demonstrators built a barbed-wire barricade and stacked piles of rocks throughout the square , surrounded Friday by soldiers in riot gear and tanks . \nVolunteers checked identification cards of people entering the square and searched them for weapons . \nOthers stood by with emergency medical kits . \nLarge screens showed coverage of the demonstrations on state television and Al-Jazeera as people played music , sang patriotic songs and danced . \nA man with an Egyptian flag wrapped around his head sat on a curb , flashing a victory sign . \nIt was a remarkable change from the scenes that unfolded in the square Wednesday and Thursday when pro- and anti-Mubarak supporters clashed repeatedly , leaving at least 11 people dead and more than 900 others injured . \nJournalists , citizens attacked in Egypt Who is instigating the Cairo violence ? \nThe Health Ministry reported that at least 5,000 people have been injured since the demonstrations began in Egypt early last week . \nMany believe the violent clashes were orchestrated by the embattled regime and on Friday , the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights called for a `` transparent and impartial '' probe . \nBut defenders of Mubarak were notably absent from the square Friday . \nInstead , they staged a `` Day of Loyalty '' rally at a nearby mosque . \nMubarak has said he will not seek another term in the September election , but now faces increasing pressure from the United States and other world powers to step aside much sooner . \nU.S. President Barack Obama skirted the question of whether Mubarak should resign immediately Friday , saying instead that the `` key question '' the Egyptian president should be asking himself is `` how do I leave a legacy behind '' that helps Egypt get through the current transition . \n`` There needs to be a transition process that begins now . \nThat transition must initiate a process that respects the universal rights of the Egyptian people and that leads to free and fair elections , '' Obama said . \nLater , a senior U.S. official said that Obama 's remarks reflected the fact that the United States recognizes that certain legitimate legislative hurdles must be taken care of before Mubarak steps down . \nWhile pressing for Mubarak to act quickly , the U.S. official said the White House recognizes the process will take some time . \nThe Obama administration is hopeful negotiations will begin Saturday between members of Mubarak 's government and various opposition representatives , the senior U.S. official said . \nEgyptian Prime Minister Ahmed Shafiq told the Al-Arabiya network that it would take until September to work out constitutional issues so that a new government could come to power . \nAt this juncture , said Shafiq , compromises were key as the country pursues dialogue with opposition groups . \nOpposition leader ElBaradei told CNN 's Eliot Spitzer late Friday that he has been in contact with various parties , united in their belief that Mubarak must go . \n`` We have been in agreement right now that we 'd probably have a presidential council of three members including somebody from the army . \nWe have a caretaker government ... who would then run the country for a year , prepare the grounds for the necessary changes in the electoral process to ensure that we will have all what we need for a free and fair election , '' he said . \nElBaradei did not rule out the possibility of his running for president . \nThe thirst for immediate change was evident as rallies took place in several Egyptian cities . \nIn Alexandria , thousands made their way from the city 's central mosque down the wide seaside Corniche . \n`` This is a great revolution and the whole regime , the entire system needs to be changed . \nThe revolution must continue until all objectives are met , '' the mosque 's imam told the crowd . \nWriting on the walls leading to the mosque , where police and anti-government demonstrators clashed last Friday , said `` Game OVER '' and `` Pharaoh 's last day . '' \nRoughly 35,000 people took to the streets Friday in the city of Suez , a spokesman for opposition leader Ayman Nour told CNN . \nAmong the protesters in Cairo was Moussa , the Arab League 's secretary-general , and Muhammad Rifaa al-Tahtawi , spokesman for Al-Azhar University , the prestigious center for Sunni Muslim education . \nAl-Tahtawi told CNN he resigned from his Al-Azhar position and joined the anti-government protesters in Tahrir Square . \n`` I am against the regime . \nAnd I am supporting the revolution , '' he said . \nMubarak told ABC News Thursday that he would like to step down right away , but can not because he does not want to risk plunging his nation into chaos . \n`` I do n't care what people say about me , '' Mubarak told ABC . \n`` Right now I care about my country , I care about Egypt . \n`` I was very unhappy about yesterday . \nI do not want to see Egyptians fighting each other , '' he said in the interview conducted at the heavily guarded presidential palace , where the embattled leader has been staying with his family . \nHe accused the Muslim Brotherhood for instigating the violence , while his deputy also laid blame on the media . \n`` I actually blame certain friendly nations who have television channels , they are not friendly at all , who have intensified the youth against the nation and the state , '' Suleiman said on Nile TV . \n`` They have filled in the minds of the youth with wrongdoings , with allegations , and this is unacceptable . '' \nThe government cracked down Thursday , arresting and beating journalists and human rights workers documenting events . \nThe harassment continued Friday with the storming of Al-Jazeera 's office in Cairo . \nThe network reported its office was attacked and burned by `` gangs of thugs . '' \nIn the last week its bureau was forcibly closed , all its journalists had press credentials revoked , and nine journalists were detained at various stages . \nAl-Jazeera has also faced unprecedented levels of interference in its broadcast signal as well as persistent and repeated attempts to bring down its websites , the network said . \nLate Friday , Human Rights Watch , a rights organization , said that Egyptian authorities had released researchers from its group , Amnesty International and two foreign journalists . \nIt called on officials to also free its Egyptian colleagues , who it says are still detained . \n`` Why does n't the government want us around ? '' \nasked New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof , `` What is it that it plans to do in the next few days that it really does n't want cameras to be able to report on ? '' \nThe Committee to Protect Journalists , a New York-based advocacy organization , said Friday it has documented at least 101 attacks on journalists and news facilities this week . \nThe advocacy group cited numerous media reports claiming that Ahmad Mohamed Mahmoud , a journalist working for the newspaper Al-Ta ` awun , had died of wounds suffered while filming the protests . \nWhite House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said the administration continues `` to receive very disturbing reports '' of `` systematic targeting '' of journalists in Egypt . \nAppalled by the attacks , U.S. officials encouraged Mubarak 's government to plan a path out of power . \nVice President Joe Biden urged his Egyptian counterpart to ensure that `` credible , inclusive negotiations begin immediately '' with opposition political groups to expedite the creation of a new democratic government , according to a statement from Biden 's office . \nThe U.S. Senate , meanwhile approved a resolution calling for Mubarak to immediately begin a peaceful transition and transfer power to a caretaker government . \nCNN 's Amir Ahmed , Ivan Watson , Jill Dougherty , Nic Robertson , Saad Abedine and journalist Ian Lee contributed to this report . \n"}

'' \nLet 's go straight to Anderson Cooper in a secret location in Cairo live tonight . \nAnderson , what do you make of today ? \nIt seemed a strange day , a day that started very promisingly , massive crowds in the square . \nWhat 's going on , do you think ? \nANDERSON COOPER , HOST , ANDERSON COOPER 360 Well , first of all , that video is from -- dated January 28th which was last Friday . \nThat was the day kind of all hell broke loose here in terms of violence . \nSo it was a very difficult day here . \nThe U.S. embassy , as you 've said , has said a number of their vans were stolen . \nThat 's about all we know . \nIt does n't seem to make sense . \nThe U.S. embassy was placed on lockdown on that day . \nSo the idea that there would have been U.S. personnel driving around seems highly unlikely . \nSo there seems no reason not to believe the idea that the vans were stolen . \nIn terms of today , Piers , it was an extraordinary day . \nWe think of the violence that we have seen for the last 48 hours , nevertheless despite that , in the face of that , bravery won out . \nPeople , tens of thousands of people here , Egyptians who are against Mubarak decided to go down to the square , even though they had seen their compatriots attacked with rocks and Molotov cocktails . \nEven though they must feared at times for their own safety , they went in huge numbers , Piers , in numbers that matched what we had seen earlier in the week before the violence began . \nAnd it was an extraordinarily jubilant crowd of people . \nAnd also significantly the Egyptian military finally after 48 hours of literally standing by watching rocks being thrown and Molotov cocktails thrown and watching and allowing , I should point out , pro-Mubarak demonstrators to descend into an area where they could attack anti-Mubarak protesters , the military finally set a perimeter , a cordon . \nThey set out concertina wire . \nThey actually checked people to try to prevent infiltrators from coming in . \nChecking people 's IDs , doing body searches . \nThey made it -- they helped it be a peaceful day . \nAnd the earlier reports of the shooting that we heard a short time ago from the square , early reports indicate , though I ca n't confirm it myself independently , early reports indicate that some pro- Mubarak demonstrators were attempting to get close . \nThe military was firing in the air in order to keep them back . \nThat is certainly another good sign , Piers . \nMORGAN : It 's been a quite remarkable 48 hours , Anderson . \nI ca n't remember a situation like this where you have extraordinary violence against both the media and protesters and then this eerie calm and serenity in the square , almost . \nDo you think that Mubarak and his government officials realize that the full force against the media and protesters backfired on them in terms of PR around the world ? \nCOOPER : I think -- I mean , I hate to try to analyze events without just knowing -- without just reporting complete facts , but my impression is that these protesters , these pro-Mubarak protesters were allowed to get close to the square perhaps in the hopes that they would push out the anti-Mubarak protesters , that they would end this once and for all . \nClearly that did n't happen . \nI 'm not sure anyone anticipated the ferocity of the defense that the anti-Mubarak protesters put up . \nThe ingenuity of building barricades , of tearing up pavement stones , arming themselves with rocks in response to rocks that were being hurled at them . \nNo one was searching the pro-Mubarak demonstrators for weapons , I keep pointing out , but I think it 's an important point . \nSo they were n't able to be beaten back . \nThe military clearly could not have promised not to shoot into the anti-Mubarak protesters . \nSo perhaps now we 're seeing a situation where they would be allowed to remain in the square , but the attempt is maybe just to kind of -- try to wear them down , wear them out . \nAnd as others have pointed out it is very difficult for the protesters in the square to remain there . \nThe conditions are tough . \nYou know you can only imagine . \nIt 's like sleeping out in a public space for 12 days . \nIt 's not an easy thing to do -- Piers . \nMORGAN : Anderson , it 's great to have you back on camera tonight and we 'll come back to you a little later in the show . \nThe uprising in Egypt has brought the country 's economy to a complete standstill . \nThe man in charge of fixing that is Finance Minister Samir Radwan who was sworn in on Monday . \nHe joins me now by phone . \nDr. Radwan , what will happen when the banks reopen on Sunday ? \nWill you be able to keep the Egyptian economy from collapsing ? \nDR. SAMIR RADWAN , EGYPTIAN FINANCE MINISTER -LRB- via phone -RRB- : Certainly we will do our best . \nIt 's not the best situation , but we are extremely well prepared for that eventuality . \nRADWAN : We have been -- yes . \nMORGAN : How bad is the situation , sir ? \nIf you do n't mind me asking . \nRADWAN : Not at all . \nI mean the situation of the stocks has changed as very well known . \nIt 's clear we have lost something like seven billion pounds before the closure of the stock exchange . \nThere is also the damage to the departure of one million tourists and the tourists are not coming in the same numbers Egypt was expecting . \nThis is the height of the season . \nSo -- and then there is , of course , the damage to property and so on that resulted from the demonstration . \nSo all in all , I think the damage is quite substantial . \nBut we are extremely well prepared . \nI am in constant touch with the central bank governor . \nWe are coordinating together to make the opening of the banks and eventually the opening of the stock exchange as smooth as possible . \nMORGAN : You also -- you also have a problem with foreign investors . \nWe 've already seen companies like Coca-Cola and GM beginning to rein back on their investments because they 're concerned about the stability of the country . \nHow much of a problem is that going to be , do you think ? \nRADWAN : Certainly it is a problem . \nBut what we are trying to do is that we shall not go back on any commitment that we have made to our foreign investors . \nThat 's why the governor of the central bank has decided and declared that the outflow of money will not have a ceiling , will not stop . \nThe second thing is we are trying to make money available . \nFor the rush , we expect a rush on the banks as soon as the banks open on Sunday . \nSo we have made absolutely sure that the ATM machines have cash . \nThat the banks can cope with the payment both of Egyptian pounds and foreign exchange . \nMORGAN : And in terms of basic foodstuffs like wheat and flour and so on . \nMORGAN : What is the situation in relation to those kind of imports ? \nRADWAN : Well , as you know , Egypt is dependent on imports of foodstuffs from abroad . \nAnd one of the -- one of the first decisions I have taken on Monday was to allow the release of foodstuffs and essential commodities from the port of Egypt , Alexandria and Suez and so on -- without asking , without obliging the importers to pay customs duties at the moment . \nAll they need to do is to give an undertaking that they will pay it later when conditions are better . \nI have arranged with the army to ensure the transport because transport was really a bottleneck to ensure the transport of these foodstuffs so that they can reach through the different towns and the front markets in Egypt . \nMORGAN : Dr. Radwan , we 've noticed that today it seems remarkably peaceful in Cairo in particular compared to previous days . \nWhy do you think that is ? \nRADWAN : I think , you know , the president , and the vice president , and the prime ministers have gone as far as possible to respond to the demands of these young people . \nThese young people , you see , have come out to the streets like at the beginning of their demonstration with very fair demands . \nThey are talking about jobs . \nThey are talking about corruption . \nThey are talking about , you know , the freedom and so on . \nAnd so all these poverty , income distribution , all these are very legitimate demands . \nNow the fact that there are other political agenda that interfered with the situation and unfortunately on Wednesday the situation turned a bit nasty . \nBut I think people realize that it is the future of this country at stake . \nFor instance , unemployment . \nThe longer these demonstrations continue , the longer the situation continues in the country , the more difficult unemployment problem would be solved . \nMORGAN : Finally , Dr. Radwan , I have to ask you this because you 're the first member of the Egyptian government I have spoken to . \nBut there were some appalling scenes yesterday involving a large number of western journalists being beaten up , and stabbed and in some cases kidnapped and threatened with beheading by people apparently acting at the behest of the government . \nWould you like to take this opportunity to apologize ? \nRADWAN : I would apologize to any journalist or any foreigner or any Egyptian for that matter that has been subjected to this harsh treatment . \nThe instructions are very clear . \nI have -- because other colleagues of yours from the international media told me about this . \nI inquired and I was told that there is zero tolerance , zero tolerance of this government on attacks against foreigners , let alone journalists whom we need to have them on our side , to watch this situation unfold and convey a much better image to the outside world . \nMORGAN : Doctor Radwan , thank you for your time . \nYou have a huge task ahead of you and I wish you every success with it . \nRADWAN : Thank you very much indeed . \nMORGAN : President Hosni Mubarak tells ABC 's Christiane Amanpour he blames the Muslim Brotherhood for the bloodshed in Tahrir Square . \nChristiane joins me now from Cairo . \nChristiane , first of all , congratulations on a terrific scoop yesterday with your meeting with President Mubarak . \nWhat was his demeanor like ? \nCHRISTIANE AMANPOUR , ABC NEWS : His demeanor was well . \nHe greeted me warmly . \nI had been to that palace many times before in my life as a foreign correspondent for CNN and I had interviewed him several times before . \nSo we knew each other and he greeted me and really wanted to tell me that he had made that decision to step down . \nAnd he said to me , you know , it 's been 62 years that I have been in public life , Christiane , and it 's really enough . \nI 'm fed up . \nBut I ca n't go right now , he said . \nBecause otherwise it would be chaos and the Muslim Brotherhood would take over . \nThat has been his line , the government line . \nThat 's what they 're telling allies . \nThat 's what they 're telling the United States . \nMORGAN : Tell me , Christiane , I mean , do you think he 's right ? \nI mean you know the area better than most people . \nDo you think he 's correct in his reading of the situation ? \nIf he was to suddenly leave it could actually provoke more chaos than if he stays for the transition ? \nAMANPOUR : Well , two issues here . \nThere is the struggle between whether he should leave now and try to prevent more chaos and instability or , as you say , if he stays and leaves precipitously , could that open a whole new can of worms and a whole new vacuum . \nAnd people have a lot of different ideas about that . \nWhat we have found is that there are people obviously who are concerned about the Muslim Brotherhood . \nWe 've even seen and talked to people in the square today . \nSome young people who say , we do n't want our uprising , they call it our revolution , hijacked . \nOthers saying , no , the Muslim Brotherhood is part of Egyptian society and that it only represents 20 or 30 percent of society . \nAnd they 're not going to win without the accession of the people . \nSo -- also the Muslim Brotherhood knows about these fears that the west and the rest have . \nSo they issued a statement . \nAnd I spoke to one of the leaders today who said that we 're not going to field any presidential candidates . \nWe do n't even want any ministerial positions and we 're ready to enter talks on the future . \nAnd I asked why they would n't field any presidential candidates and they acknowledged that there is this fear about them around the world . \nAnd that they wanted to respect what they told me the civil democracy that they hope would come to replace what 's happened with -- to replace Mubarak 's regime . \nMORGAN : There was obviously an appalling day yesterday in terms of attacks on journalists , Christiane . \nHave you ever seen anything quite like that in terms of a concerted effort by a government to gag the media in such brutal way ? \nAMANPOUR : Well , you know , it certainly has been really appalling what 's happened . \nAnd I have actually been in so many places around the world where , when things go wrong , when a certain group does n't like what 's going on , they immediately blame the media . \nAnd here the Foreign Ministry -- and it was broadcast all over state television -- basically said that the uprising was a foreign conspiracy led by international journalists , so people who watch state television and that 's the only place they get their news , believe it . \nIn addition , we believe that there were people who were deliberately targeting journalists , who were looking for them , who were harassing them , sometimes hurting them in the streets . \nWe were surrounded by angry mobs , for instance , on two days . \nAnd also people who went into hotels and started to take and dismantle broadcasting equipment . \nI asked the Minister of Information yesterday , would he please put a statement out that the foreign press is to be respected , that we 're here to do a job , to cover the story , to cover the facts . \nWe have no agenda other than to do our job . \nAnd he promised to me that he would put that out on state television and state media . \nAnd certainly today , the situation is much calmer all around . \nWhether it 's about journalists or indeed whether it 's about the protest , the army is deployed to give a bigger buffer zone between the protesters in the Liberation Square and there have not been the kinds of pro-Mubarak protesters , organized or not , who have come to try to break up these protesters in the square . \nIt 's totally different today . \nMORGAN : Christiane , I know you 've got more of this on `` Nightline '' later . \nThank you very much for taking the time to join me . \nMORGAN : When we come back , a very tense night in Cairo and a young woman , her family under fire , stopping at nothing to get her story out . \nAnd later the revolution will be tweeting . \nMy exclusive with the prime minister who came to power thanks to Facebook and Twitter . \nMORGAN : We 've been following her story all week , the Egyptian journalist who 's risking everything to get her story out . \nSarah Sirgany is deputy editor of `` The Daily News Egypt '' . \nShe joins us again via Skype . \nSarah , good evening . \nSARAH SIRGANY , DAILY NEWS EGYPT\\/INTL . \nHERALD TRIBUNE : I 'm fine , thank you . \nMORGAN : Before we go any further I 've had so many people commenting on my Twitter about how you 've become their new heroine . \nSIRGANY : There are a lot of heroes out here , it 's not just me . \nMORGAN : I think what they like is the fact that you 're putting yourself at risk and yet you 're determined to keep getting the story out . \nAnd that 's a really important function at the moment . \nHow has the day been for you out there ? \nSIRGANY : So far the protests in Tahrir have been very peaceful . \nPeople have a great time . \nThe spirit there is great , but it 's actually when people were trying to leave the protests that problems started to happen . \nThere are thugs still out there in downtown -- the downtown area . \nAnyone who looks remotely foreign is being checked . \nAnyone with a camera is being checked . \nThe army is very helpful , but the problem is when people gather up around reporters or activists or anyone just happens to be coming up from the downtown area . \nIt 's a dangerous situation . \nMORGAN : I heard that your own brother had a bit of a run-in with some thugs today . \nAnd it 's not the first time . \nThe day before he was trying to protect some journalists , some foreign journalists , and that was not even near the Tahrir area . \nAnd then another time , and today when they were coming out of the demonstration in Tahrir , people stopped them , asked to see their IDs , accused them of being foreigners . \nAll of them were Egyptians and actually looked Egyptian as well . \nBut the fact that they were coming from the area made them look suspicious . \nAnd it was just a random attack . \nAnd then even when they 're going home after the army released them , it 's -- they 're still being stopped . \nOne of them had a camera and that seemed enough for people just to accuse them of anything . \nThere are still some same people out that are trying to get people out . \nBut it 's still very dangerous and it 's deterring a lot of people from actually going out to do anything . \nMORGAN : So tell me , what is your take on the mood of the people now because we have very violent day yesterday , not so violent today . \nNo one seems quite sure whether Mubarak is going to stay or go . \nDo the people want him gone now ? \nIs he going to go now , do you think ? \nSIRGANY : I do n't think he 's going now . \nBut the people in Tahrir they stayed there . \nThey have seen people die . \nI do n't think they 're -- I do n't think they 're leaving until there is some drastic change . \nAnd so far there has n't been any . \nMORGAN : Do you think they still want Mubarak gone now ? \nSIRGANY : At least the people I 'm speaking to over there . \nMORGAN : Sarah , keep up the great work . \nI 'd love to talk to you again . \nI think you 're doing , as I said , an incredibly important job . \nAnd really you keep going . \nWhen we come back , does President Obama really like what he sees in Egypt tonight ? \nAnd later , blowback . \nI 'll ask security experts , does the chaos in Cairo put you at risk ? \nOBAMA : The Egyptian government has a responsibility to protect the rights of its people . \nThose demonstrating also have a responsibility to do so peacefully . \nBut everybody should recognize a simple truth . \nThe issues at stake in Egypt will not be resolved through violence or suppression . \nAnd we are encouraged by the restraint that was shown today . \nWe hope that it continues . \nMORGAN : That was President Obama just a little while ago sounding optimistic about Egypt . \nI 'm joined now by Wolf Blitzer . \nWolf , is he right to feel optimistic ? \nWOLF BLITZER , CNN 'S SITUATION ROOM : I 'm not sure he really does feel optimistic . \nI think he was encouraged that today we did n't see the kind of violence that we saw yesterday and the day before , but based on everything I 'm hearing from inside the Obama administration they are deeply worried . \nThis is by no means looking rosy right now . \nThey 've got a game plan . \nWhat they would like to see , they 'd like to see President Mubarak step down in a graceful , dignified way . \nMaybe go to his home in Sharm el-Sheikh , the southern tip of Sinai , or some place else . \nBut they certainly would like to see , at least in a transition , the Vice President Omar Suleiman take charge with the military and set the stage months down the road for some sort of free and fair elections . \nBut that 's their wish . \nThey are not convinced at all that that 's necessarily going to happen . \nIt 's going to happen if all the things fall into place . \nBut right now there is so much , Piers , that can still go wrong , can still go in the other direction . \nSo they 're very , very nervous . \nMORGAN : I mean I 've been hearing very conflicting reports . \nA good source of mine close to the White House said to me today that actually one of the scenarios that may play out is if there is n't much violence over the next few days that Mubarak may actually hang around to be part of a transition period and that this comes down to the Egyptian sense of pride and honor that they should be doing this for a man who 's led them for 30 years and who has , whether you like him or not , whether you think he 's a dictator or not , has been a good ally to America for all that time . \nBLITZER : Well , I think there is a whole group of people that would believe that . \nAnd as far as everything I can tell that 's a lot of wishful thinking . \nAs far as the protesters are concerned , those who are at Tahrir Square or elsewhere in Egypt , they do n't want President Mubarak hanging around at all . \nThey would like to see him go away right now . \nAnd I sense that that 's what the administration would like to find . \nYes , he was very helpful in the peace process . \nHe had a peace with Israel . \nHe was very cooperative with the United States in the war on terror . \nHe fought al Qaeda . \nThe U.S.-Egyptian military to military has been excellent over 30 years . \nSo they like Mubarak but recognize that the average person on the street or at least the people protesting now want him gone and it 's not going to stop , the demonstrations , until he leaves . \nSo it 's a delicate dance they have to play out right now . \nMORGAN : It really is . \nIs this one of the most difficult foreign policy decisions you have seen an American president have for quite some time ? \nBLITZER : It 's a very difficult foreign policy decision . \nFrom the U.S. perspective there can be a positive outcome , there can be democracy . \nPotentially there could be a great new pro-western secular government , free and fair elections that emerges in Egypt , maintains good relations with the United States , maintains the peace treaty with Israel , works to promote an Israeli Palestinian agreement . \nThat would be the best of all worlds . \nBut they also see a real possibility that it could be a disaster for the United States that the bad guys take over , that there could be a military coup on the one hand or even further an Islamist regime that takes over in Egypt . \nSo there is a whole range of options out there . \nThey hope there is a secular , democratic , positive regime that emerges . \nThat will require an enormous amount of finesse and work . \nAnd I think what 's clear to president Obama now and the top national security advisers , the U.S. has limited influence . \nIt has to put together a coalition . \nI noticed the White House put out a statement that the president spoke with the prime minister of Turkey tonight , and I think they are trying to coordinate a strategy . \nBut if you look at the other U.S. allies in the region like the Saudis , for example , they are not happy with what they see , and they think the United States is sort of pulling the rug out from underneath President Mubarak . \nAnd the Saudis are a critical ally , as quote , and that 's a severely flawed regime as well . \nMORGAN : Wolf Blitzer , thank you very much . \nMORGAN : When we come back , exit Mubarak and to terror -- what we need to know before power changes hand . \nAnd later , a revolution in 140 characters -- wait until you hear what started the wave of rebellion halfway around the world . \nMORGAN : What are the implications for Egypt 's neighbors in the Middle East ? \nJoining me now is Chuck Hagel , chairman of the Atlantic Council and a former member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations . \nI heard John McCain say this was potentially the most dangerous situation the Middle East has faced in our lifetimes . \nHow worried are you about Israel which is seeing its number one protector in many ways now being exposed to the will of the people and that could go anywhere ? \nCHUCK HAGEL , CHAIRMAN , ATLANTIC COUNCIL : Well , I think John 's comments were correct . \nNot since the 1967 and 1973 wars in the Middle East have we seen such a dangerous time . \nBut this is even maybe more dangerous because it 's more unpredictable , that the bilateral relationship , the first peace treaty with an Arab country that Israel had and still has and has been very important to Israel 's security has been with Egypt . \nIf new leaders take over in Egypt , which I believe is going to happen , it 's just a matter of how and when , then where does it put that relationship between Israel and Egypt ? \nAnd that certainly is not only in Israel 's interest but in America 's interests , other countries in the Middle East . \nMORGAN : What happens if the Egyptian people simply do not want to go along with the timetable that would suit America ? \nClearly a peaceful , relatively well-organized transition is the preferred option for everybody because it 's less chaotic , but if the protests continue , they get bigger , they get angrier and there is more violence , is n't Mubarak just going to have to go ? \nHAGEL : I think we have to recognize and accept that it will be the people of Egypt that will ultimately determine the course of Egypt , including its leadership . \nWe have few controls here . \nWe have some controls , we have some instruments of power we must employ wisely . \nBut it 's the people . \nThat 's what this is about . \nWhat happened in Tunisia , what 's happening in Jordan , what 's happening in Yemen . \nThis is the human condition manifesting itself . \nYes , we want an orderly , peaceful transition and I hope that 's how this comes out , but I think it is yet uncertain . \nMORGAN : Unpredictable times . \nSenator , thank you very much , indeed . \nMORGAN : Michael Chertoff was Homeland Security Secretary under George W. Bush and he says it is a matter of time before Mubarak leaves . \nMichael Chertoff , When will leave ? \nMICHAEL CHERTOFF , FORMER HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY : I think it 's clear he 's going to leave no later than September , but my sense is he will probably leave before then although I do n't think he will want to appear to be chased out of office . \nI think much of what you see now is a question of timing and transition . \nMORGAN : Presumably it is not in America 's interest that he 's seen to be chased out of office or the protesters may think , hang on , we are onto something here and start chasing everybody out of office . \nCHERTOFF : There are two elements here . \nFirst , we do n't want to create an appetite for upheaval just for the sake of upheaval , but the process has to be managed . \nThat means there has to be plan in place and ultimately transition to free and fair elections . \nAnd I think a precipitous exit , particularly one that appears to be a matter of being forced out of office works against that transition . \nMORGAN : As somebody who has been a leading light in Homeland Security , what do you see now as the threat to America 's security by what you are seeing in Egypt ? \nCHERTOFF : First , let me say I think it 's a wonderful thing to see democracy in action and people going into the streets not to be violent but to demonstrate peacefully . \nWe have largely seen the people who want change are peaceful . \nObviously we 've seen the pro Mubarak forces being more violent . \nBut in long run a stable regime which is Democrat and free and probably in America 's best interest . \nI think what we worry about again is where are we headed and how quickly are we headed there ? \nWe certainly do n't want disorder to see things spin out of control . \nNor do we want to see a government in place that would be anti-American , because Egypt has been an important partner to us , to the region , and of course if we were to have an anti-American regime that would be a problematic issue especially from a security standpoint . \nCHERTOFF : People keep playing down the Al Qaeda for Egypt and there certainly have been links . \nHow seriously should we take the threat ? \nCould it get worse ? \nCHERTOFF : Piers , from what we are seeing it does not appear to be going on . \nBut you 're quire right to point out that if you look at the people around bin Laden they have been drawn from Egyptian radicals who were enemies of the regime for 10 , 20 years and frankly originally focused on Egypt as the location they wanted for the first radical revolution . \nSo I have to believe people around bin Laden are watching very closely looking to see if they have the opportunity to really seize the advantage and turmoil . \nThe good news is we have a lot of people who are not radical extremists , and one hopes there is enough time to manage the transition so people who are rational and want to have a democratic and free regime can maintain control . \nMORGAN : Finally , what would you say is the doomsday scenario here ? \nWhenever there is a void like this , there is always a danger when things are unpredictable that anything could happen . \nWhat would be the worst that could happen from America 's point of view ? \nCHERTOFF : Well , Piers , right now the army appears to be playing the role of a stabilizing force . \nThey have been disciplined in the way they deal with demonstrators . \nThey appear to be invested in managing a transition . \nThe doomsday scenario I do n't would be one in which order breaks down and what happens historically is even small groups can take control of the revolution because they have the discipline and they may have the weapons to do so . \nIf you go back to 1917 , you know , that 's how the Bolsheviks took power following on the first wave of the Russian Revolution . \nWe do n't want to see another Iranian revolution scenario in Egypt . \nI think there are real differences which are positive in the direction of a democratic outcome . \nBut we 'd be unwise to be complacent or take it for granted . \nThat 's why I think negotiating with the military and with Mubarak about a disciplined transition is very important for America 's interests as well as for the safety and security of the people in Egypt . \nMORGAN : Thank you very much for your time . \nMORGAN : Next , my exclusive interview with a man who took power after his country 's youth logged on throughout the government . \nLater we go back live to Cairo where we are hearing heavy gunfire again . \nMORGAN : That woman was chanting `` No , Mubarak , we will not be ruined , and tomorrow with our shoes we will step on you . '' \nShe 's one of tens of thousands of protesters in Tahrir square all of them fighting for Egypt to go the way of Tunisia where strongman Ben Ali was overthrown last month . \nPrime Minister Mohamed Ghannouchi is now in charge . \nThe prime minister mentioned the role of Twitter in Tunisia 's revolution . \nI want to hear your views . \nTweet me at Piers Morgan . \nPrime Minister Ghannouchi , thank you for joining the show . \nCan I ask you immediately , you have been in charge of your country for 22 days now . \nHave you managed to achieve stability ? \nMOHAMED GHANNOUCHI , TUNISIAN PRIME MINISTER -LRB- via translator -RRB- : We went through difficult times . \nThere were security issues that are fortunately now in the past . \nWe are now working on social challenges given the urgent demands to improve living conditions , but that has not stopped us from preparing for the future . \nWe adopted concrete measures to ensure the historic change that our country needs so that the changes towards democracy , freedom and respect of the fundamental rights of the Tunisian people be assured so there will never , ever again be a dictatorship in Tunisia . \nMORGAN : Mr. Prime Minister , can I ask you , have you been surprised by the events in Egypt , and do you believe that President Mubarak should now go immediately ? \nGHANNOUCHI : We are worrying about our own country . \nOur revolution is unique . \nIt was caused by the young . \nFacebook and Twitter were the levers . \nIt has been held in a peaceful way . \nToday , we were able to break with the past thanks to what we have in our DNA . \nTunisia , as you know , is an exporting country , but we do not pretend that we export revolutions . \nWe have friendly relationships with all peoples , regardless of the region where they live . \nMORGAN : Mr. Prime Minister , what happened in Tunisia was that the young people decided they wanted revolution . \nThey were unhappy with the regime . \nAnd we have seen the same now happen in Egypt . \nDo you believe that this is a crisis for the whole of the Middle East ? \nGHANNOUCHI : I have n't really thought about it . \nSince January 14th , we have been totally focused on bringing order to the country , getting back to normal , and accomplishing this challenge of democracy . \nIt is a difficult task . \nWe are all mobilized -- youth , adult , elderly , women , children -- to succeed . \nWhat preoccupies us today is Tunisia and only Tunisia . \nMORGAN : Prime Minister , if President Obama is watching this interview , what would you like to say to him and the American people ? \nHow can they help you in Tunisia ? \nGHANNOUCHI : First of all , I would like to thank the American people that have always helped Tunisia since our independence . \nWe never forget what the American people did for Tunisia in critical moments of our history . \nWhat I would say to him is that since January 14th , we have received many messages of sympathy and support . \nOne of the first messages Tunisia received was from the United States . \nDuring the conversation I had with Ms. Hillary Clinton , I was really touched and sensitive to the message she relayed to me from President Obama so that I would convey it to the people of Tunisia . \nMORGAN : Prime Minister , finally , let me ask you , when do you expect to hold elections in Tunisia ? \nIs it true that once they have been held , you intend to retire from politics yourself ? \nAnd do you believe that you 're going to find successful peace and prosperity in your country in the next few years ? \nGHANNOUCHI : We have already entered negotiations , and a commission has been formed to revise the laws to make this election free and transparent , an election that will allow all parties to participate with the same chances . \nIt is the task of the national commission working on political reform that must be undertaken . \nThat will allow us to find out in a few days the schedule so that the elections can be held in a way to uphold our objective that the elections be at the level of the hope generated by this peaceful revolution , a revolution that 's reinforced our duty to succeed . \nIn my first interview with Tunisian television , I said that my political career will end the day when the baton is passed to the next government , which will be formed once the elections are held . \nWe have lots of young people , great talents . \nWe have to leave room for those who want to serve this country and who want to give Tunisia a chance to become a democracy , to make Tunisia a free country , a country where energy is freed from every constraint , a country that is dignified for its 3,000-year history . \nI have confidence in our people . \nI have confidence in our youth . \nI have confidence in all political parties that today are eager to preserve fundamental freedoms . \nThose that respect women 's rights , women 's freedom , freedom of religion , freedom of thought , we have confidence that these men will succeed in steering this country towards the shores of freedom and democracy . \nMORGAN : Prime Minister Ghannouchi , thank you very much for your time . \nI have been to Tunisia . \nIt 's a great country . \nI hope to come again , and I wish you every success with your democratic , free elections , and with your career personally . \nGHANNOUCHI : I would be happy to host you in Tunisia so you can see our country post-revolution . \nMORGAN : Prime Minister , thank you for your time . \nGHANNOUCHI : Thank you very much . \nMORGAN : And as I said before that interview , that was the Prime Minister Mohamed Ghannouchi from Tunisia fascinatingly revealing the role of Twitter in his country 's revolution . \nI want to hear your views about that . \nTweet me at @piersmorgan . \nComing up , the latest from Cairo where heavy gunfire broke out in Tahrir square this evening . \nMORGAN : We 're going now to Ivan Watson live in Cairo . \nIvan , it 's been a weird day in my ways , calm for the most part , but gunfire this evening . \nWhat is your take on what 's going on right now ? \nIVAN WATSON , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : Well , we 've again experienced some remarkable changes , Piers . \nWhen I spoke to you this time last night , there had been attacks on the journalists . \nWe were seeing soldiers deployed around the opposition controlled barricades here in Tahrir Square , and there was an ominous feeling that something terrible was coming . \nLittle did I expect that space would be named and tens of thousands of people would be allowed to move into this place where a large political rally was able -- allowed to basically take place in what had been a war zone , where you had an opposition enclave under attack , and allowed to have emotional , peaceful political rally calling for the resignation of Hosni Mubarak . \nA remarkable change of events and showing that this symbol of defiance has survived two days and two nights of fighting and is that much stronger for it . \nMORGAN : We just heard the prime minister of Tunisia talking about the power of Facebook and Twitter in particular on the revolution there . \nAnd we 've seen similar things going on in Egypt . \nAre you back on in terms of technology ? \nCan you tweet from there ? \nCan you get on the Internet ? \nAre mobile phones working ? \nWATSON : Mobile phones are working , and the Internet did come back on several days ago . \nI saw an estimate that the cost of shutting down the internet and the telephones in this country was something astronomical and truly a sign of really the dramatic and potentially self-destructive decisions that the government made in the first days of what can safely be called a political stages , or the early stages of one in Egypt here . \nMORGAN : How do you see the next 24 , 48 hours , Ivan ? \nIs it possible to make any kind of prediction with any certainty ? \nWATSON : No way , absolutely not . \nI do n't think any of us from one day to the next predict what could happen next . \nSo all I 'm going to say is that in this place , in this opposition , anti-Mubarak enclave now , because that 's really what it is now . \nYou have these barricades that have been established , the kind of barricades that could have been in Paris in the 19th century when revolts started up . \nThese people are now stronger . \nTheir morale is higher . \nThey have fought and bled and died , and they 're still here . \nAnd they have gotten more popular support . \nThey 're not going away . \nMORGAN : Ivan , thank you very much for another excellent report . \nPlease stay safe there . \nIt 's unpredictable and it 's dangerous . \nThat 's it for us tonight , `` PIERS MORGAN TONIGHT .

{"id": "101", "time": "2011-02-04", "text": "11th Day of Unrest in Egypt Aired February 4 , 2011 - 16:00:00 ET THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT . \nBECKY ANDERSON , CONNECT THE WORLD , CNN : United in prayer and in protest . \nTens of thousands keep Egypt uprising against their president alive before an 11th day . \nThe Friday of departure has n't quite worked out . \nPresident Hosni Mubarak is still in office with an hour to go until midnight . \nFrom Cairo 's Tahrir Square to these jubilant demonstrators of Alexandria there is no giving up . \nANDERSON : We 're going to go live to Cairo in just in a moment first . \nWe want to show you what a difference a day makes in Egypt uprising after clashes this week killed at least 11 people in Tahrir Square . \nMany fear the worse for this Friday . \nThe mood was far different . \nProtestors were festered happy to have held their ground and hopeful the change is just around the corner . \nANDERSON : As light broke across Tahrir Square this morning a sense of anticipation filled the air for what many dubbed the day of departure . \nGovernment troops in circled the square early after two days of bloody battles between pro and anti-Mubarak protestors . \nSecurity check points was set up to search the 10s of 1000s of people before they were allowed in . \nBy 9:00 in the morning the square was getting full . \nPeople who stayed overnight shared breakfast with one another . \nMany brought in their own supplies . \nNext to them piles of rocks in case fighting broke out . \nAccording to our reporters there the mood early on was largely optimistic and peaceful . \nEgyptians stood side by side singing and dancing . \nMany chanting for Mubarak to finally leave . \nAt noon , the crowd kneeled for Friday prayers momentarily transferring the square into a place of worship . \nMany of our CNN correspondents were tweeting photos from the demonstrations . \nThese photos from Fred Pleitgen showed crowds chanting and waving flags . \nThe demos were largely festive for most of the day . \nBut by 6:00 p.m. local time there were reports of running battles between pro and anti- Mubarak protestors . \nGun fire could be heard in the air on the outskirts of Tahrir Square but it last for only a few minutes . \nAs night fell , 10s of 1000s still remain determined to see through their demands to the end . \nANDERSON : Well before we go live to Cairo a lot -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- this hour reports the US wants Mubarak out immediately . \nWe 're going to go to Washington for more on that and ask an expert why he thinks that might be a bad idea . \nThe role of the Muslim Brotherhood remains crucial . \nAyan Hirsi Ali will tell us how she was once a part of that group and what they 'll mean to Egypt 's future . \nAnd later the bigger picture , were going to explore what people in the region have been asking for and what they are really getting . \nThis is the 11th day of protest in Egypt drew to a close demonstrators got a new promise the government . \nPrime Minister Ahmed Shafik says force will not be used to clear Tahrir Square . \nWell let 's get the latest on these situations on the ground . \nArwa Damon joins us from the Cairo . \nARWA DAMON , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Hi Becky . \nWell part of the reason that we did see that relatively speaking a sense of calm over Tahrir Square despite the clashes that happen on some of the side streets is because throughout the day he Egyptian military did maintain a much heavier presence that anything that we had seen in the past . \nThey were blocking off some of the major routes leading to the square . \nAnd we did see the pro-Mubarak group keeping their distance . \nBut that at around 10:00 pm local time around an hour ago we also saw the military with a drop on some of those positions handful of pro-Mubarak groups moving in taking up their usual positions on one of the over passes leading to the square . \nAnd despite that their presence was absence in Tahrir Square it felt for the most part it most certainly was felt once a person ventured past the square as we did today . \nWe came across small gatherings of pro-Mubarak demonstrators . \nWe squirted past them for the simple reason that it was by in large the pro- Mubarak groups that were those who were attacking the media . \nAnd at this point , it does really appear that attempt to truly diffuse this crisis have fallen flat . \nThe opposition groups denied be by President for political to meet with him over the last few days . \nThere is talk of a group of wise man as its being dubbed up trying to form some sort of an agreement between the opposition and between the governments . \nAnd although speaking relatively of course from the last few nights there is this sense of calm . \nThere is always that overriding concern that violence could erupt at any moment . \nWhen we have an interrupt it has happen immediately , suddenly and very surprisingly Becky . \nANDERSON : All right . \nArwa Damon on the ground there in Cairo . \nLet 's bring in anti-government demonstrator . \nHe 's become a regular contributor to our show over the past week or so . \nGigi Ibrahim has been protesting in Tahrir Square right from the start and she joins us now on the line from Cairo . \nHow are things at this point ? \nWe just heard from Arwa . \nWhat 's the mood in an hour to go until midnight ? \nGIGI IBRAHIM , PROTESTOR : The mood is really different today considering the violence that we had in the past two days . \nReally a lot of people turn out today to for the Friday prayer and it was such an amazing , beautiful , emotional scene . \nPeople were praying and crying for those who died since really the revolution has started and there 's a lot of self-organization . \nYou can witness coming into Tahrir you were searched maybe by 10 times by just the volunteers and average citizens who are taking up this role on themselves to make sure that there are not violent intruders within in the Tahrir Square . \nANDERSON : Gigi you think part of what is being quite a remarkable people 's revolution as it were . \nAt this point on the 11th day what sort of progress do you feel that you made ? \nIBRAHIM : Excuse me , I did n't hear you . \nANDERSON : What sort of progress do you think you 've made given that Mubarak is still in Egypt ? \nIBRAHIM : I think the progress is really Egypt had you know gained its self-confidence again . \nThe people , the people have this sense of pride and honor of being Egyptian and that is reflecting in every part in Egypt . \nYou look at the neighborhoods being protected by its own citizens . \nAnd in some sense we taken control back of our country and that 's putting a lot of pressure on Mubarak and making those people demand in Tahrir Square even more powerful . \nAnd the world is completely watching and supporting - and completely supporting the Egyptian people . \nFrom all the messages have been receiving over you know the course of this whole thing and it 's truly , truly remarkable . \nANDERSON : And yet the demands from protestors , well there 's simply one demand is n't there , that Mubarak go . \nHe is still there . \nIBRAHIM : What happens is that really the people over in Tahrir Square will not leave . \nThe determination is persistent and of staying there until Mubarak officially steps down . \nEverybody is you know knows that his time is over . \nLike he 's obviously not going to continue to be in power but the more people stay in Tahrir Square and the more violence and the more people that die because of the whole revolution it makes the people more and more determine to fight for freedom and justice and human dignity really by demanding and being more persistent for Mubarak to step down now and not in September . \nANDERSON : The pictures and crowds have been quite remarkable but if he were n't to go - I mean are you confident that he will go ? \nAnd if he does n't go will you continue to protest ? \nHow long can you keep this up ? \nIBRAHIM : I think , I think the people from my own perspective from just how I 've been there every day . \nEvery day I see I see it go up a level and the determination and the wiliness of the people to stay there as long as it takes for Mubarak to officially step down . \nI do n't think it will end peacefully at least . \nIf Mubarak does n't step down anytime soon these people can be there for weeks and days . \nAnd if the government you know will basically force the people to go out of Tahrir Square then it 's going to be obviously a massacre because these people are not going to give up easily . \nAlright Gigi you 've joined us through the week and one hopes you 'll continue to be with us as we move through the days to come . \nGigi Ibrahim there from Tahrir Square . \nWe 're staying with this story throughout the hour . \nLater from Tunisia to Yemen , Sudan and more the feedback loop from the regions protest and where that 's headed . \nAlso Ayan Hirsi Ali joins me to talk about the Muslim Brotherhood . \nYou want to listen to her she 's been part of that group . \nAnd right after this break why you need to care about Washington imagination in Cairo . \nSixty seconds away stay with us . \nUNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT : Will your country ever be ready in your opinion for democratic reforms ? \nHOSNI MUBARAK , EGYPTIAN PRESIDENT : The democratic reform is an ongoing process . \nWe started economic reform , political reform , and social reform at the same time . \nWhen you go back to 1981 until now in 18 years so many reforms took place . \nANDERSON : Egypt 's Hosni Mubarak there talking about a -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- for democracy way back in 1999 . \nWell for many protestors it 's not enough their president has agreed to go by September they want him out now . \nWell according to the New York Times the White House who has been discussing plans for him to leave immediately . \nMore on that in a moment first listen to this . \nWe caught up with the foreign minister today . \nHere 's how Ahmed Gheit responded to those claims . \nAHMED ABDUL GHEIT , EGYPTIAN FOREIGN MINISTER : We Egyptians were not like oppositions from abroad . \nUNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT : But this is your own people asking you to do this . \nGHEIT : No , no , it is not our own people . \nUNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT : There are protestors out there saying we want -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- . \nGHEIT : The President to transform the country and we all of us will transform the country . \nAnd we will transform the country through chaos but we will transform the country through an orderly transformation . \nAnd I call it transformation and not transition . \nBecause I read the New York Times today and you relinquish power to your Vice President illegally because if you transfer power or your relinquish you relinquish power to the Speaker of parties . \nANDERSON : Well yes President Obama just spoke in Washington . \nHe did n't directly address the New York Times report but he did hint at a different strategy . \nSaying any details of a transition needs to be worked out by Egyptians . \nPRESIDENT BARRACK OBAMA : Second , the future of Egypt will be determined by its people . \nIt 's also clear that there needs to be a transition process that begins now . \nThat transition must initiate a process that respects the universal rights of the Egyptian people and that leads to free and fair elections . \nNow the details of the transition will be worked out by Egyptians . \nAnd my understanding is that some discussions have begun . \nBut we are consulting widely within in Egypt and with the international community to communicate our strong belief that a successful and orderly transition must be meaningful . \nANDERSON : Must be meaningful . \nWell our next guest pleads there 's some major risk associated with any plans to force Mubarak out immediately . \nTarek Masoud a professor at Harvard University . \nFor years he 's been a leading scholar and voice on Middle East and politics . \nHe 's got a personal stake in this story as well he 's of Egyptian origin with family in the country . \nSir thanks for joining us tonight . \nYou say he should n't be forced out immediately . \nTAREK MASOUD , PROFESSOR , HARVARD UNIVERSITY : Well I 'm not he needs to be forced out immediately . \nI 'm just saying that there are some risks associated with forcing him out immediately . \nAnd the main risk there are two risks . \nThe main one is that if you are forced out immediately the you could imagine that the crowds would dissipate and then it would be much harder for the opposition leaders to actually negotiate anything with the military . \nBut even more important than that I guess is that it would trigger a new election within 60 days a new Presidential election within 60 days . \nAnd the presidency in Egypt is kind of imperial institution . \nIt 's got Victoria powers and one of the things you would want to do before triggering a presidential election is amending the Constitution . \nAnd you ca n't amend the Constitution if the president - unless there 's an elected president sitting . \nIf there 's an interim president you ca n't dissolve the Parliament . \nI mean you could amend the Constitution but it would have to be the current Parliament that would amend it and that 's an illegitimate parliament elected through fraud . \nSo you need to dissolve the Parliament and only an elected president can do that and set that process in train . \nSo there is that Constitutional issue involved . \nThis sounds complicated but it is important . \nSo let 's pursue this . \nSo how should this orderly transition or transformation as the Foreign Minister -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- earlier on . \nHow would it work and is n't the operative word here then orderly ? \nSo this is but one path of many paths that could be taken and I do n't want to you know push to have for one path or the other . \nBut it seems to me that if you want to follow the Egyptian Constitution and get from where we are now to a more democratic order then the first thing you would do is dissolve the parliament . \nAnd that requires Mubarak to stay . \nBecause if Mubarak left whoever succeeded him could n't dissolve the Parliament and their be an election within 60 days . \nSo you dissolve this kind of illegitimate Parliament , you have new parliamentary elections within 60 days . \nThis new Parliament amends the Constitution to you know make it easier for independents to run for the presidency , to reduce some the powers of the presidency . \nAnd then Mubarak resigns and an interim President is you know appointed and that would be the Speaker of the new house , the Speaker of the new Parliament . \nAnd then you would have new presidential elections for this diminished presidency . \nSo that 's one way to do it is you follow a kind of constitutional process and there are advantages to that . \nI mean if you want to really deepen this principle of adherence to law , adherence to the Constitution what better way to do that than to you know insist on it hearing even to a Constitution that is really quite flawed . \nANDERSON : Let me throw a spanner into the works here a hypothetical spanner into the works . \nI 'm going to put you on the spot here . \nThere have been talks today , nothing that we can standup but talk that the military could actually takeover at this point . \nWhether or not Washington will be prepared to back that is another question entirely . \nHow would that change things ? \nMASOUD : Well so the military does not have the right to takeover according the existing Constitution . \nSo once the military takes over if that were a possibility now were in a land of extra Constitutionalism outside of the Constitution . \nAnd then we would be really relying on the good graces of the military to relinquish power , to set and train a reform process . \nAnd this has happen in other countries . \nThis is not to say that that could n't work in Egypt . \nBut in Egypt you have an experience with the military entering politics and taking control . \nIt happens in 1952 and Egyptians have had a devil of a time getting them to go back to the barracks . \nAnd so one worries about that particular path . \nANDERSON : I 'm going to put you on the spot again . \nI 'm going to ask you to your mind you 're Egyptian so you got of sort you know you got an interest in this more than just the fact that you academically absolutely proficient in what you 're saying tonight . \nSo to your mind at this point given what you 've seen and given what you 're hearing we have no idea who 's talking to who at this point . \nWhat do you think going to happen ? \nMAOUD : That 's a very hard question . \nI will note that we 've been paying a lot of attention to Mohammed -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- the committee that has been put together of leading opposition figures to presumably negotiate with the government . \nWe have n't spent as much time focusing on this committee of wise men . \n-LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- who are led by a man name -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- another gentleman name -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- who 's one of the Egypt 's billionaires . \nAnd they 're actually , they 've got about you know two dozen people on this committee and they 've got a plan for a transition that does seem to be a more constitutional path and that might offer a way out . \nWhat they 're proposing is that Mubarak delegate to Omar Suleiman , Omar Suleiman . \nANDERSON : Great stuff , interesting , watch out for the wise men . \nObviously something keep an eye on them . \nI 'm sorry that we lost him just at the end there coming out of Harvard for you this evening . \nWell it 's not just Egypt that 's plotting a new future . \nAcross Africa and the Middle East of course protestors are transforming the political landscape . \nComing up a look at what they 've achieved and ask where it might all end . \nPlus , it 's not first time we 've change sweep across an entire region . \nLater we 're going to hear from one man who 's witnessed history in the making first hand . \nBut next , we 've heard a lot about Muslim Brotherhood recently but what part could they play in Egypt 's future ? \nI 'm going to ask a former member . \nANDERSON : Well I see of first support for democratic reform and freedom . \nTens of thousands of people gathered in Egypt second largest city Friday to demand President Hosni Mubarak resign . \nNobel Peace surprise winner turn dissident to Mohammed ElBaradei was amongst those taking part in Alexandria 's day of departure . \nMany Muslim Brotherhood members also in the crowd . \nYou 're with CONNECT THE WORLD I 'm Becky Anderson in London . \nThere 's no doubt this uprising was all in the street reflecting the anger of average Egyptians against an oppressive regime . \nWith the inclusion of the Muslim Brotherhood has got some highly concern about what might happen post Mubarak . \nWell it 's hard to say for sure how much support the Brotherhood has . \nEgypt 's largest opposition group is officially band . \nIt does contest elections with candidates running as independents . \nIn 2005 , the Brotherhood gain about 20 percent of the seats in Parliament . \nBut this may not accurately reflect their strength as the elections were not free and fair . \nMuslim in Brotherhood has evolved over the years renouncing violence decades ago and clearly condemning groups like Al Qaeda . \nBut its principle goal remains unchanged . \nIt wants Islamic law to Egypt . \nInteresting then that it 's now teamed up with secular reformer Mohammed ElBaradei of course it does n't mean it will stay with him long - term . \nWell the New York Times reports a Brotherhood spokesman told Al Jazeera earlier in the uprising political groups support ElBaradei to negotiate with the regime . \nTuesday that same spokesman said and `` it 's too early to even discuss whether ElBaradei should lead a transitional government or whether we would join him . \nWell another Brotherhood spokesman tells CNN they 're not a political force to be feared . \nSaying , they support freedom of press and freedom of religion for all . \nWell out next guest says there is plenty of reason for alarm in Egypt secular have better get their act together . \nThis is somebody you 're going to recognize . \nAyan Hirsi Ali is a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute , she 's also author of Nomad and Infidel books that describe her own upbringing under Islam . \nThank you for coming tonight there 's a reason for this . \nYou were a member of the Muslim Brotherhood as a youngster . \nAYAN HIRSI ALI , AUTHOR , `` NOMAD '' AND `` INFIDEL '' : I was 15 years old and they were the only movement the individuals were offered as a moral frame walk that was familiar . \nThe individuals who came to school were of us , they were among us and they were not corrupt , they gave us life full of purpose . \nAnd compared to all the other organizations who came up with dreams about freedom , my father was a freedom fighter . \nHe was all about democracy . \nBut he and his groups were unable to agree . \nThey were unable to reach a conclusion of what it is that they wanted once they have driven away the strong man . \nThe Muslim Brotherhood invoked Allah , they invoked the prophet Muhammad , they invoked the hereafter . \nAll of that was familiar and they provided services that the states did provide and that our tribes and clans did not provide either . \nANDERSON : Say you were of the Muslim Brotherhood it has to be said has legitimized Hosni Mubarak 's regime in the west . \nThe president says if he quits the result would be chaos . \nThis is what he told ABC News last night . \nAnd a movement Brotherhood takeover that is what he says . \nWhat would a greater role then do you think for the Brotherhood mean for Egypt ? \nALI : I think Hosni Mubarak position is the fallacy of presenting the west in particularly America with the binary vision either a tyrant or -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- . \nBut it does n't have to be that . \nSecular movement especially the liberals , I consider myself a liberal would have to organize only present to the people of Egypt their improvement on mobile regime but also the other side the shadow side of the Muslim Brotherhood . \nWhat does it mean when -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- is implemented and brought to the Egyptian people ? \nWhat will it mean for women ? \nWhat is it going to mean for religious minorities ? \nWhat is it going mean for the economy ? \nYou see a lot of people in the Arab world now demonstrating for bread and butter . \nDo you think that -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- is going to deliver ? \nThe Egyptian people have an example to learn by the history of a people like Iran . \nIf you consider the gay movement in 2009 it was not an opposition to a strong man . \nIt was a no to -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- that 's the people of Iran who had voted in I think in a moment of absent mindedness in 1979 . \nANDERSON : The difference between a democracy and theocracy of course . \nA theocracy would be run by clerics . \nI did n't think anybody is suggesting the Muslim Brotherhood is suggesting that . \nAmr Moussa he 's the Secretary General of course of the Arab League , former Foreign Minister and -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- of Egypt and -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- has hat into the ring as far as getting involved in the Unity Government . \nWas on CNN earlier on and when he was asked about whether people should fear the Muslim Brotherhood this is what he said and our viewers are just going to have a listen to this . \nAMRE MOUSSA , ARAB LEAGUE SECRETARY GENERAL : Fear that the Egypt future will be -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- within that -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- either Muslim Brotherhood or left or right . \nI would assure you that Egypt is looking forward for a more liberal future and that Egypt by nature , by the mood of its people and the mood of country will be part of the 21st Century and look for modernism and the future more than anybody thing . \nANDERSON : Liberal , modernism a group that wants to be forward thinking that 's Amr Moussa 's point here . \nHe 's trying to put to bed those fears and concerns that people have . \nWhat do you think the challenge is for the secular democrats faced with what is you know a movement that could be divisive going forward ? \nALI : Well the secular movement need to interview something that is local that is Arab that says yes to Islam but no to -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- . \nIn other words a separation of religion from politics . \nI think if they devise with the help of the west or without the help of the west but in any case I would say with the help of the west . \nIf they devise programs and institutions civic and economic institutions that can maintain that separation of church and state , they have religion and state affairs . \nThey could in the long run defeat the Muslim Brotherhood . \nThe Muslim Brotherhood offers -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- law and that is a theocracy . \nI have had votes . \nWe know from history before Khomeini was elected he was dismissed as a peaceful man and somebody was n't going to be elected . \nLook at the Taliban in Afghanistan , look at the rise of Al Qaeda . \nLook at the -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- coming to power . \nSo I think one of the things that is working for the Muslim Brotherhood is the fact that they are systematically underestimated . \nANDERSON : Many people will say they 'd only get something like 20 percent of the vote . \nYou say you think that they are systematically underestimated . \nWould you go so far as to say that they should n't be part , though , of a unity government going forward ? \nALI : I would go so far as to say , when a new constitution is devised , that clauses have to be put in the constitution , for instance , comparable to that of Kemal Ataturk 's , Turkey , that Sharia Law , or a theocracy , that that is not democratic , that that 's not constitutional . \nSo , there have to be safeguards built into the constitution to prevent a theocracy . \nBut I think , once they meet that , they should be able to take part . \nAnd I believe that , if secular groups , especially the liberal groups , if they try and offer a program of liberation and economic prosperity to the Egyptian people , they could win . \nANDERSON : Fascinating stuff . \nAyaan Hirsi Ali , always a pleasure to speak to you . \nWe thank you very much , indeed , for coming in tonight . \nWe 're following this story to the very end , but for some of our reporters on the ground , it is a struggle to stop the story from following them . \nAfter the break , we 're going to show you some of the challenges that go into tracking these remarkable events . \nAnd , of course , we 'll be live in Cairo . \nDo stay with us . \nYou 're watching CNN . \nI 'm Becky Anderson in London . \nANDERSON : Welcome back . \nYou 're watching CONNECT THE WORLD here on CNN . \nLet 's get you a check of the headlines this hour . \nTens of thousands of protesters filled Cairo 's Tahrir Square again Friday for what they called the `` Day of Departure . '' \nIt did n't live up to the billing , as President Hosni Mubarak is still in power . \nBut protesters are hopeful he 'll resign earlier than promised . \nBarack Obama says the world is watching Egypt and that the transition process must now begin . \nIn a statement a short time ago , the US president called for free and fair elections and says any negotiations must include a broad representation of the Egyptian opposition . \nThe ripple effect from the Egyptian protests is continuing across North Africa and the Middle East . \nHundreds of demonstrators in Jordan called for political reforms and an end to government corruption , although these protests were smaller than those held in previous weeks . \nAnd Australian prime minister Julia Gillard surveyed the damage from Cyclone Yasi on Friday . \nThe Australian prime minister flew into northern Queensland to promise government and military aid after the huge storm slammed into the region earlier this week . \nAnd the trading week has come to an end on Wall Street . \nDisappointing jobs numbers meant the Dow only finished slightly higher . \nThe US economy adding 36,000 jobs last month , but analysts expected more than four times that number . \nThere 's the closing figure for you , still over the 12,000 mark , so not a bad week . \nThose are your headlines this hour . \nWell , covering what 's been going on in Egypt can be dangerous . \nOur team on the ground are definitely up against it . \nBut here 's a taste of what they 've been able to deliver on Day 11 of these protests . \nIVAN WATSON , CNN CORRESPONDENT -LRB- on camera -RRB- : CNN crews in other locations in this city overlooking Tahrir Square have been ordered by the Egyptian police not to provide live images of what 's going on in here . \nWe are doing it right now , but our neighbors at this location have warned us that suspected secret police are outside trying to get in to shut our -- potentially shut us down . \nAnd we have a report from the Al Jazeera news network that a gang of thugs raided their Cairo office today and set fire to it . \nSo , the effort to crack down on foreign media continues here in the Egyptian capital . \nARWA DAMON , CNN CORRESPONDENT -LRB- on camera -RRB- : We are seeing the military that moved in overnight taking something of a more proactive role . \nA complete difference to what we have seen them do in the days past , where they were taking something of a neutral stance , allowing both camps to fight it out , even allowing attacks on international and local media to take place . \nThere is still great concern about the potential of violence , with many Cairo residents saying they are still remaining under self-imposed house arrest . \nThe predominant emotion throughout the capital is still fear and uncertainty . \nFREDERIK PLEITGEN , CNN CORRESPONDENT -LRB- on camera -RRB- : We 're right in front of one of the checkpoints leading into Tahrir Square . \nAnd , of course , one of the problems the protesters have , here , is getting enough food , water , and enough supplies in to keep all of these people going for such a long time . \nBecause some of them have been here for over a week . \nAnd their system is one where everybody brings a little bit and , therefore , everybody has enough to survive . \nWe are all together . \nYou have the bread , we have cheese , we all gather with the food . \nPLEITGEN : And you give other people , as well ? \nNot for us only . \nPLEITGEN : So , it 's a spirit of sharing , here , then . \nUNIDENTIFIED : That 's right , it is , yes . \nPLEITGEN : Thank you . \nAll right , so , a lot of people are actually coming in , one for the camera woman , as well , and they 're giving us and other protesters groceries , food , and bread to survive . \nANDERSON : All right , let 's bring in Ivan Watson , who is on the ground for us . \nSome of our reporting on Day 11 . \nWith 30 minutes to midnight in Cairo , Ivan , we 've been talking about the mood , and perhaps we should move on and really talk about how you 've been reporting this story . \nIt 's about as tough as it 's got , for you , I guess , in your career ? \nWATSON : No , no. . \nThe attacks on the journalists over the past three days , they 're substantial . \nEverybody I 've talked to has been harassed or had much worse occur to them . \nAccording to the Committee to Protect Journalists over the past few days , more than 100 incidents of journalists being attacked , detained , or having their equipment destroyed . \nThis is not a coincidence , Becky . \nANDERSON : You 're there on the balcony , now , I guess . \nI mean , do you feel comfortable in reporting now ? \nWATSON : I think among the opposition activists at the time being , the foreign media , the local media is welcomed by them , as they have been struggling to get their voices heard , both in Egypt and in the outside world . \nAnd these people have been putting their lives on the line to hold onto this patch of territory , as well . \nSo , for the time being , with these people here , we feel quite comfortable . \nIt 's a different story when you move beyond the barricades to the areas where the Egyptian secret police are operating and the pro- government , as many have taken to calling them , `` thugs , '' who have been carrying out the systematic attacks on the journalists . \nANDERSON : Yes , it is it any clearer just who is behind this intimidation at this point ? \nWATSON : No , it is n't , and I think government officials have denied even playing any kind of role in the attacks that have taken place on Cairo 's Tahrir Square over the course of the past three days . \nThey have even said that they are going to investigate who may have been behind what the vice president called was `` a conspiracy . '' \nANDERSON : Ivan Watson , there , in Cairo for you . \nIvan , we thank you very much , indeed . \nAll right , let 's move from Cairo , shall we , to the port city of Alexandria . \nAs you can see from this Google Earth image , Alexandria is roughly 200 kilometers north of the Egyptian capital , and the tensions have reached there and are exposing some divisions in society . \nNic Robertson has been talking to some local residents for you . \nROBERTSON -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Inside cafes , the talk is of the violent clashes in Cairo , pausing only to watch as protesters pass by . \nA week ago , this man was one of the protesters trying to oust the president . \nROBERTSON -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Inside the same cafe , anti-Mubarak activists claim pro-government factions stalking Alexandria 's streets are paid to attack them and tell me they 're not going to give up until Mubarak goes . \nBy the seafront , far from the protests , patience among this ancient city 's fishermen long since ran out . \nNet maker Ali Farhad -LRB- ph -RRB- is furious . \n`` This is wrong , '' he says . \n`` They 're destroying the country , stopping business for all the people . \nWe 're with Mubarak . \nWe need calm . '' \nHis son , Mohammed Ali is angry , too . \n`` The protesters are hurting our business and bringing armed thugs to the streets . '' \nBattle lines are being drawn , the middle ground evaporating . \nTAREK EL-TAWIL , SENIOR JUDGE : The regime is panicking , are frustrated , they do n't know what to do . \nBut never -- there have been never used to see this kind of demonstration . \nROBERTSON -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Tarek el-Tawil , a senior judge , thought Mubarak was backing down , until he saw the violence in Cairo . \nNow , he says , the president should face trial for war crimes . \nEL-TAWIL : It 's against humanity , what they did yesterday . \nThey massacred -- call it a massacre . \nOf course , of course . \nWe 've seen very recently that international lawyers and stuff like that and human rights organizations will start to push , of course . \nROBERTSON -LRB- on camera -RRB- : And will that convince him to step down ? \nEL-TAWIL : Of course , of course , if they have no choice . \nROBERTSON -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : It 's a very , very uneasy calm . \nOver there on the corner are Mubarak loyalists waiting for anti-Mubarak demonstrators to come along , waiting for confrontation . \nSo far , at least the anti-Mubarak supporters have been able to avoid violent clashes . \nNic Robertson , CNN , Alexandria , Egypt . \nANDERSON : All right . \nSo , in the past week , we 've seen two Arab leaders vow to stand down and an entire government dismissed . \nSo , what more can protesters hope to achieve ? \nWe 're going to discuss a region in turmoil , up next . \nANDERSON : It 's about 17 minutes to midnight in Egypt . \nIn just a few short weeks , an entire region has been turned on its head , has n't it ? \nIts people are finally getting a taste of freedom , and the desire for democracy is spreading far and wide . \nIn Egypt , anti-government demonstrators forced President Hosni Mubarak to promise not to run for reelection . \nWell , their inspiration came , in part , from Tunisia , where a protest against corruption led to the ousting of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali . \nIn neighboring Algeria , a decades-old state of emergency will reportedly be lifted after demonstrations there . \nAnd in Jordan , public anger prompting King Abdullah II to dismiss his government and appoint a new prime minister to carry out political reforms . \nWell , after decades in power , Yemen 's president , Ali Abdullah Saleh , bowed to protesters ' demands this week and vowed not to seek reelection in 2013 . \nMass protests have been organized online in Syria , but one planned for today saw few people take to the streets . \nAnd in Sudan , students have staged a series of demonstrations over corruption and rising prices . \nSo , where is this regional unrest heading ? \nWell , I 'm happy to say I 'm joined to discuss this by CONNECT THE WORLD panelist and regular guest on this show , Fawaz Gerges . \nI do n't even have to say who you are these days , because everybody knows you as well as they know me . \nIt 's not clear , at this point , who is talking to who in Egypt , whether the military may take over , whether the president may go now , or whether he may stay through September . \nWhat is , though , clear is that the wall of fear , not just in Egypt , but across the region , has fallen and changed the very nature , the psychology of a culture , has n't it ? \nFAWAZ GERGES , INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS PROFESSOR : It really has . \nI mean , you 're talking about the barrier of fear has been removed . \nOne of the major reasons why Arab dictators have been able to dominate their populations and subjugate their population is because of the security apparatus . \nAnd that 's why you had political apathy and fear . \nWhat has happened in the last few weeks , now , is that people have become active and , basically , the barrier of fear has been removed . \nAnd you 're seeing , now , millions , not just hundreds of thousands of Arabs , now , realize they can own their future , they can determine their own history . \nANDERSON : We are seeing movements across the region , but they do n't parallel each other , do they ? \nWhat we 've seen in Syria is really sort of protest-lite , dare I call it that . \nWe see concessions by ruling parties and rulers across the region , but it 's not as big as we 've seen in Egypt or Tunisia , for example . \nGERGES : Not at all , and I think you 're absolutely correct about drawing attention to differences as well as similarities . \nTunisia is not Egypt . \nSyria is not Jordan . \nJordan is not Yemen . \nThere are some major differences . \nBut there are also similarities , and the similarities are the following , they are shared by almost every Arab state . \nFamily-based states as opposed to rational , modernizing by various states . \nAnd dismal economic conditions . \nDismal -- on average , Becky , you have on average between 40 and 50 million -- 50 and -- between 40 and 50 percent of the 300 million Arabs live either in poverty or below the poverty line . \nThe population -- take Egypt . \nIn 1952 , when the military officers carried out their coup , there were 15 million Egyptians . \nToday , you have 84 million Egyptians . \nHow do you feed , how do you educate , how do you provide for the 84 million people ? \nYou also have systems and institutional systems that have been decimated , that have been shattered . \nANDERSON : All right . \nWe know that there is change afoot , change amok , as it were . \nBut history shows , and you and I know this , and most of our viewers will know this , that removing a corrupt , authoritarian leader through people power is , to a certain extent , the easy part . \nConstructing a new system which is inclusive and transparent , with institutions that work , is much , much harder . \nGERGES : In fact , the huge challenge facing the Arab world is the morning after . \nThat is , the morning after you get rid of your dictators . \nThere are no institutions . \nWe have been talking the last few days , the Egyptian military is the most respected institution . \nIt should not be the only respected national institution . \nWhat has happened to the parliament ? \nWhat has happened to other institutions ? \nThere are no institutions . \nYou have to build institutions . \nInstitutional building , Becky , takes decades . \nHow do you feed and provide for the -- how do you create a productive base ? \nOn and on , so many difficulties and challenges . \nANDERSON : Which is , perhaps , why we have heard the rest of the world calling for an orderly transition at this point . \nThe people on the streets of Egypt want their president to go . \nWe 've seen , as we say , people protest around the region . \nBut is this orderly transition , and `` orderly , '' here , being the operative word , important at this point ? \nGERGES : Well , Becky , this is the question . \nWhat do we mean by `` orderly ? '' \nDo we mean by an orderly transition , that is the army manages the transition , the army puts its own people to replace Hosni Mubarak . \nNow you have the vice president , Omar Suleiman . \nYou have the prime minister , a military general . \nThe interior minister , and the defense minister . \nSo , what kind of ch -- the reality is , even though the challenges are massive , you have to begin somewhere . \nYou have to begin the process of institutional building . \nYou have to give people a say in their political and economic well-being . \nANDERSON : Let 's sit back . \nIt is -- we 're into the first week of February . \nWe 're into the 11th day , and just before midnight in Egypt , the 11th day of the protest in Egypt , we 've seen this wave across the region , the sort of shifting sands , dare I call it that , across the region . \nWhen you sit back and just take stock of where we are , what 's your first thought ? \nGERGES : Truly , this is historic . \nIf you had asked me a few weeks ago , I would have said never in Egypt . \nNow , what I call -- I call it the Arab anti-father . \nPeople now realize that the authoritarian role , not just the barrier of fear , has fallen . \nThis is a critical moment , because people realize they have power . \nAnd now -- and what 's beautiful about what we 're seeing , Becky , you 're not seeing American flags being burned . \nYou 're not seeing people talking about Western imperialism . \nThey 're talking about their dictators . \nThey want to take charge of their destiny . \nThis is really what matters . \nANDERSON : You just talked about the day after , the day after in the Arab world . \nDoes that worry you ? \nGERGES : A great deal . \nThere are tremendous risks . \nAnd this particular transition is not assured . \nIt will be messy , it will be prolonged , you might have some setbacks . \nBut at the end of the day , the Arab world -- the Arab world has been living under dictatorship since the end of colonialism . \nYou need to begin -- the Arab world must join what I call the democratic wave . \nThe democratic wave had just reached the Arab shores . \nIt 's a beautiful moment . \nIf the Arab -- if the Arab intellectual and political and economic elite can manage this particular transition , in two or three decades , I 'm willing to -- this would be truly -- it would transform the Arab world and the relationship between the Arab world and the West . \nOn a Friday evening in London , and at ten minutes to midnight in Egypt , Fawaz , we thank you very much , indeed , helping us out over the last couple of weeks . \nJust ahead on CONNECT THE WORLD , how scenes from the streets of Egypt are stirring up memories for one photojournalist . \nA look back at some of the famous revolts against powerful world leaders . \nYou 're with CNN , we will be back in 60 seconds with CONNECT THE WORLD . \nANDERSON : Those powerful images from Friday in Egypt . \nThere it 's seven minutes to midnight , now . \nWell , in this evening 's Parting Shots , I want to show you how Egypt 's demands are reverberating right around the world , not just in the region . \nFirst to Iran , where after Friday payers , worshipers chanted for President Mubarak 's removal . \nIn Turkey , pro-Islamic groups demonstrating in Ankara demanded an end to the ruling regime in Cairo . \nA protest in Kuala Lumpur outside the Egyptian embassy was later broken up by police using water canon . \nAnd in Paris , the group Reporters Without Borders campaigned against the attacks on journalists in Cairo . \nRegardless of age , Egypt 's protests have been gathering momentum . \nEgyptians in Prague called for the immediate resignation of Mubarak outside their embassy . \nIn South Africa , this woman marched on Pretoria with around 250 other campaigners for the president to be ousted . \nSince January the 25th , the Egyptians ' chants have been echoed across many cities . \nHere in London , a series of rallies have been held supporting the uprising . \nWhile in Rome 's Republic Square , around a hundred people gathered to show their solidarity . \nAnd in the US , many Egyptian sympathizers have been out on the streets calling for change . \nThis photo from a gathering outside the UN Egyptian mission in New York . \nWell , all of us have been watching events , have n't we , in Cairo , wondering whether , after almost 30 years of rule , Hosni Mubarak might , just might , be on his way out . \nWell , Peter Turnley is a photojournalist and colleague who told us it not only brings back memories of Mubarak 's rule , but it makes him think of all the strongmen like him that he 's photographed , all the uprisings , all the turmoil . \nTake a look at this . \nPETER TURNLEY , PHOTOJOURNALIST : Well , what has come to my mind as I have been witnessing these events unfold is that I had a photo session , a one-on-one photo session with Mubarak all the way back in 1986 , this was 25 years ago , and he has now been in power for 30 years . \nWatching these events unfold , it has occurred to me the quantity of popular revolts against authoritarian leaders . \nCeausescu , Erich Honecker , Assad , Khomeini in Iran , Saddam Hussein in Iraq , Cedras of Haiti , Baby Doc Duvalier , Fidel Castro , and the list goes on and on . \nTURNLEY : I first met Ceausescu in 1989 . \nI had a photo session for a cover of Newsweek in August of 1989 at Ceausescu 's summer house . \nIt was one of the most surreal experiences of my career . \nI pushed him around for an hour and a half in a photo session where he literally obeyed me almost like a child . \nFour months later , I found myself in his own personal office in the presidential palace in Bucharest with -- watching a television where Ceausescu 's dead face was looking up at the screen in his own office on his own set . \nTURNLEY : I recall very vividly that in 1989 , I photographed Honeker standing next to Gorbachev on a reviewing stand during the 50th anniversary of the East German state . \nThey both were laughing , chatting leisurely . \nNo one could have known , that very night in East Berlin , there were huge riots and protests by Molotov-cocktail-throwing young people against the Stasi , which was the beginning of the end of the East German regime , which folded with the fall of the Berlin Wall only several months later . \nTURNLEY : I have also experienced popular revolts that started with much passion , much enthusiasm , such as the Tiananmen Square uprising in China that was a very moving uprising of literally millions of young people that simply were expressing a desire for a better life . \nThat revolt , though , ended being crushed by military hardware when Chinese troops came into Tiananmen Square , as we all know . \nAnd the consequences of that uprising , I think , are still yet not known today , this many years later . \nTURNLEY : As Mubarak was turning to walk into the presidential palace , I simply called out to him , and I said , `` President Mubarak , my name is Peter Turnley , I 'm trying to do a photo session for Newsweek . '' \nHe turned and he said to me , `` When would you like to do it ? '' \nAnd I said , `` Right now . '' \nAnd he said , `` Let 's go . '' \nHe chose to take a stance where his hands were folded and crossed in front of him , and it was a rather proud , strong , and possibly somewhat defiant look . \nTURNLEY : It has often seemed extremely surreal that some of the world leaders I 've photographed , notorious for the iron-fisted manner in which they have held power , have been quite cooperative during a one-on-one photo session . \nWhat matters most is how they will be judged by their own people and by history for the manner in which they have wielded power , and for how their regimes have impacted the lives of the citizens of their country . \nANDERSON : Pictures that tell a story . \nI 'm Becky Anderson . \nThat is your world connected . \nThank you for watching . \nThe world headlines and , then , `` BackStory '' will follow this short break . \nYou 're watching CNN . \n"}

'' \nA senior Obama administration official knocked down a New York Times report that the Egyptians and Americans were near consensus on a specific proposal . \nEgypt losing a lot of money Hosni Mubarak : In his words Crowley : We 're worried about the media Camera rolls as Cooper , crew attacked `` It 's simply wrong to report that there 's a single U.S. plan that 's being negotiated with the Egyptians , '' the official said . \nU.S. officials have made clear in recent days their desire to jumpstart talks between opposition and ruling forces in order to lay the groundwork as soon as possible for a governmental transition . \nThat includes pressuring , besides Mubarak 's government , opposition groups to engage immediately in talks . \nMubarak has announced he will not seek re-election in September . \nProtesters , however , continue to demand that he step down immediately , with a caretaker unity government running the country until the fall elections . \nWhile some , like former Foreign Minister and Arab League Secretary General Amr Moussa , believe concessions made by Mubarak presented an opportunity to build upon , members of the opposition Muslim Brotherhood have insisted no talks should take place until the president leaves office . \n`` It 's time for both of them to roll up their sleeves , '' a senior State Department official said . \n`` The government has to take some steps , but the opposition has to be willing to participate in negotiations as well . '' \nEgyptian Vice President Omar Suleiman made `` important statements '' about a political dialogue , the senior official said . \nStill , he added that the Egyptian government should allow the opposition to bring its own ideas , rather than dictate the pace and scope of a transformation to democracy . \nThe urgent call for talks comes as the Egyptian government pushed back on what it described as `` vague '' statements from the Obama administration about the pace of transition . \nAn Egyptian government official told CNN the White House has shown support for its `` roadmap '' for a transition up to when Mubarak 's term ends in September , but said President Obama 's calls for an `` orderly transition '' are at odds with his call for an immediate one . \nThe official said Mubarak is seen as a `` receding figure '' in Egyptian politics , but warned that deposing him immediately would lead to a murky political process that would make free and fair elections difficult . \nAccording to the Egyptian constitution , the presidency would be transferred to the speaker of the parliament if Mubarak leaves power without enacting certain legislative and constitutional reforms . \n`` Institutionally , there is support in Egypt for this roadmap among the military , vice president and prime minister , '' said the Egyptian official . \nEgypt : Lay of the land Will the Egyptian crisis ever end ? \nU.S. officials said they believe what transpires Friday -- when another massive anti-government protest is expected -- will be an important barometer on whether serious negotiations can take place . \nDemonstrators may be less willing to talk if attacked . \n`` It 's hard to imagine if there is a day of very bad violence , it will lead to the type of dialogue that needs to take place , '' the senior State Department official said . \nThese backroom discussions involving the U.S. and Egyptian political players come as the White House and legislators stepped up their public pressure on Mubarak 's regime . \nOn Thursday , Vice President Joe Biden talked with Suleiman and pressed him that `` credible , inclusive negotiations -LRB- should -RRB- begin immediately '' with opposition political groups , a statement from Biden 's office said . \nThat sentiment was reiterated by White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs , who told reporters `` it is important that we all begin to see meaningful steps , and that negotiations take place between the -LRB- current -RRB- government and a broadly based group of members of the opposition as we work through the transition toward free and fair elections . '' \nU.S. lawmakers have also chimed in , with foreign policy veterans Sens. John Kerry , D-Massachusetts , and John McCain , R-Arizona , among those calling for Mubarak to step aside for the sake of his country and people . \nThursday night , the U.S. Senate gave unanimous approval to a resolution calling for Mubarak to `` immediately begin an orderly and peaceful transition to a democratic political system , including the transfer of power to an inclusive interim caretaker government , in coordination with leaders from Egypt 's opposition , civil society , and military , to enact the necessary reforms to hold free , fair , and internationally credible elections this year . '' \nThe Obama administration also sharply condemned the violence that erupted Wednesday in Cairo , when pro-Mubarak supporters attacked anti-government protesters . \nAt least eight people were killed and 836 injured , according to the Egyptian Health Ministry . \nState Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said Thursday `` elements close to the government or ruling party '' carried out the violence . \n`` I do n't think we have a sense of how far up the chain it went , '' he noted . \nThe United States continues to walk a fine diplomatic line in the crisis , encouraging Mubarak to transition from power while stopping short of publicly asking him to step down . \nOfficials say the restraint is needed because the White House is mindful that allies in the Middle East are concerned about American loyalty . \nGovernment contacts have expressed reservations about how vocal the Obama administration has been in pressing Mubarak , a close American ally of three decades . \nOther regional allies are concerned about how quickly the United States might turn on them if protests start in their countries , the State Department officials said . \nThe White House , meanwhile , has made a deliberate decision to let Adm. Mike Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , take the lead role in communicating with the Egyptian military about its role in the current unrest , according to two senior U.S. officials . \nMullen has not told Egyptian military leaders to pressure Mubarak to step down , the officials insisted to CNN . \n`` That 's not his role , '' one official said . \nMullen is , however , trying to push the Egyptian military to maintain security , not move against peaceful protesters , and keep the violence from escalating . \nThe U.S. government believes Mubarak will not issue a direct order to the Egyptian army to do anything because he is uncertain his orders would be followed , one official with very direct knowledge of evolving U.S. policy in the crisis told CNN . \nA refusal on the part of the army to obey Mubarak would spell the end of the Egyptian leader 's rule , the official noted . \nAt that point , Mubarak would have to leave the country . \nThe U.S. belief right now , the official said , is that Suleiman is letting the army feel it is `` representing the flag of the nation '' in trying to help without making a massive move against the government . \nWhile Mullen is communicating with his Egyptian counterparts , the CIA has set up its own task force to monitor the crisis . \n`` The Central Intelligence Agency always surges personnel and resources as needed to meet any crisis head-on . \nThis situation is no different , and we 've established a Middle East Task Force , '' CIA spokeswoman Jennifer Youngblood said . \n`` Our 24\\/7 operations are focused on ensuring we provide the best possible insights and freshest intelligence to policymakers , '' she said . \nThe chaotic situation has raised concerns that terrorist entities could try to exploit the situation . \n`` People are watching for signs that terrorists or militant groups might try to take advantage of the situation in Cairo and launch attacks , '' a U.S. official noted . \n`` We expect groups like al Qaeda to take advantage of instability anywhere as a means to promote their cause publicly . '' \nOverall , the Obama administration is handling the Egyptian crisis relatively well so far , according to Nicholas Burns , a former Clinton State Department official . \n`` We 've got to stand up , as the president is doing , for reform and democracy , '' Burns told CNN . \nThe U.S. government needs to `` use our influence behind the scenes , and we 've got a lot of influence there with President Mubarak to move him towards a fast transition . '' \nBurns noted the importance of Egypt in terms of the Arab-Israeli conflict , shipments through the Suez Canal , and the containment of Iran , among other things . \n`` We 've got to preserve those very real American interests , '' he said . \n`` This is about as difficult a challenge diplomatically as I think we have seen in many years . '' \nMichael Rubin , an analyst at the conservative American Enterprise Institute , said that while it 's `` tempting to try to score political points '' in the current crisis , he 's not sure Obama has responded any differently than a Republican president would have in a similar situation . \nIn terms of backing Mubarak , all of Obama 's predecessors `` kicked the can down the road until the road ran out , '' he said . \nThe real difficulty , Rubin said , will come in the months ahead as U.S. policymakers try to prevent Egypt from following the path Iran took after 1979 , when the fall of Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi led to the rise of the fundamentalist regime still in power today . \nThe U.S. needs to make clear the Egyptian elections happen `` come hell or high water , '' Rubin said , but at the same pushing to ensure armed extremist militias are n't allowed to claim the mantle of democratic legitimacy . \nCNN 's Elise Labott , Kate Bolduan , Alan Silverleib , Jill Dougherty , Barbara Starr , Pam Benson , Tom Cohen , Dana Bash and Adam Levine contributed to this report . \n"}

'' \nThe shouting was reaching fever pitch , people grappling with one another , we were being spun around . \nMy cameraman , Todd Baxter , and I were being separated from our producer , Saad Abedine , and Alexandria fixer Mohammed . \nThe hands were pushing us the other way now . \nWe were spies , the man in the leather jacket was shouting . \nImpossible to know where we were being taken . \nHe kept marching us down the street , his henchmen at his heel . \nWe tried to slow and move to our car at the roadside . \nTo my dismay and concern , our driver was gone . \nThat was my hope blown , any chance of a run for it gone . \nAnd still no idea where we were being taken . \nOur unintended escort was telling us we were to blame for portraying Egypt in a bad light . \nWe were bringing the image of the country down . \nIt 's a fuzzy logic that defies the obvious . \nWhat 's happening is willed by Egyptians on their own countrymen . \nHe was n't listening . \nNo punches were being laid , but the menace was clear . \nThe walk ended at the army base . \nThe crowd circling , still pushing , shoving , shouting . \nThe soldiers cut through the chaos and took us in . \nIt was as night turning to day . \nThey were polite , organized , calm and courteous . \nThey took a cursory glance at our passports and camera , let us wait behind their heavy gate until the crowd moved on . \nIt 's chaos out there , and they know it . \n"}

'' \nBy early Tuesday morning , more than 90,000 people throughout the country had pledged to participate in the event in a Facebook group called `` We Are All Khaled Said , '' named after an Alexandria activist who was allegedly beaten to death by police . \nThe Facebook group demands raising the minimum wage , sacking the interior minister , creating two-term presidential term limits and scrapping existing emergency laws that the group says `` resulted in police control '' over the people and the nation . \nTo highlight the role of police corruption , organizers tapped January 25 -- Police Day and a national holiday -- to hold protests . \nAmnesty International released a statement Monday `` urging the Egyptian authorities not to crack down '' on the planned nationwide demonstration . \nThe banned Muslim Brotherhood , the biggest organized opposition to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak 's regime , had stated it would not have an official presence at Tuesday 's protests , but some of its members `` have reportedly been summoned and threatened with arrest and detention '' if they attend and protest , Amnesty International said . \n"}

'' \nNow , while we 're on the subject of State of the Union , we are breaking down the history of the speech for you right now . \nFirst stop : U.S. Constitution , Article II , Section 3 . \n`` The president shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the union and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient . '' \nNow , that 's what the Constitution requires ; there are a lot of things that are traditions that are not required by the Constitution . \nFor one , this address does not have to be annual , though a yearly speech dates back to George Washington . \nIt does n't need to be in person . \nIn fact , our third president , Thomas Jefferson , had the speech delivered in writing to Congress . \nAnd the State of the Union does n't need to be made at a congressional session of both Houses , though that 's what we see every year , and what we saw last night . \nHere 's why the State of the Union address is delivered in late January or early February : the 20th Amendment . \nIt was ratified in 1933 , and it specifies that congressional terms start on January third and presidential terms start on January 20th . \nSo , it 's when everyone is seated in office that the speech is given in late January or early February . \nA little history for ya : President Coolidge was the first president to broadcast the speech over the radio ; that was back in 1923 . \nHis nickname was `` Silent Cal , '' but he was n't silent then ! \nPresident Truman was the first on TV with the speech in 1947 . \nAnd this is around the time it started being called `` State of the Union '' instead of the president 's annual message to Congress , as it was known before that . \nAnd in 2002 , President George W. Bush became the first president to deliver the speech on the web . \nAZUZ : The members of Arizona 's congressional delegation were all planning to sit together for last night 's State of the Union address . \nBut they were going to leave one chair empty in honor of Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords . \nShe was one of the victims of a shooting we told you about earlier this month . \nShe 's recovering from her injuries , and she 's getting a lot of support . \nCLASS , HOUSTON , TEXAS : Get well soon , Ms. Giffords ! \nAZUZ : Those well wishes came from students in Houston , Texas . \nA lot of people in that community were sending their best wishes and signing `` get well soon '' cards for the Arizona representative . \nShe was transferred to a hospital in Houston late last week . \nDoctors say that Giffords is doing well and showing lots of improvement , but that she has a long road ahead of her . \nTOMEKA JONES , CNN STUDENT NEWS : See if you can I.D. Me ! \nI 'm an African country that 's home to more than 80 million people . \nMy national currency is the pound . \nI border two seas , the Mediterranean and the Red . \nI 'm Egypt , and my current president , Hosni Mubarak , has been in power since 1981 . \nAZUZ : Russian President Dmitry Medvedev says that whoever is behind Monday 's suicide bombing at Moscow 's busiest airport will be found and will be punished . \nThe attack killed dozens of people , injured more than 150 others . \nAnd sadly , this bombing is n't an isolated incident . \nOver the last decade , trains and planes around Moscow have been bombed at least four times . \nPresident Medvedev said that part of the blame for Monday 's attack is on the people who were responsible for the airport 's security . \nRUSSIAN PRESIDENT DMITRY MEDVEDEV -LRB- TRANSLATED -RRB- : What happened at Domodedovo shows that the airport lacked security . \nIt 's unbelievable that such a huge amount of explosives was brought into the terminal . \nThose officials responsible for security at Domodedovo must be punished for their decisions . \nThis is a terror attack , a grief , a tragedy . \nAZUZ : President Obama called President Medvedev yesterday to offer his condolences about the bombing . \nDuring that same call , he congratulated the Russian president on the progress toward a new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty , or START . \nThis would reduce the number of nuclear weapons in both the U.S. and Russia . \nPresidents Medvedev and Obama signed the treaty last April . \nPart of Russia 's parliament approved that treaty yesterday . \nThe U.S. Senate did the same thing last month . \nPresident Obama calls the START `` the most significant arms control agreement in nearly two decades .

SANJAY GUPTA , CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT : The Jonas Brothers have been one of the most successful young acts for the past several years , having sold millions of records and entertaining audiences all over the globe . \nThey just completed a world tour about a month ago , which took them from the United States to Argentina , Brazil , Europe and the United Arab Emirates . \nNow , shortly after the group signed their first recording contract , Nick , the youngest Jonas Brother , was diagnosed with Type I , or juvenile diabetes . \nNICK JONAS , JONAS BROTHERS : I was diagnosed in November of 2005 . \nSo , I was about 13 . \nI lost 15 pounds in a total of about three weeks , which was a bit startling considering I only weighed about 105 pounds to start with . \nGUPTA : Nick was told his blood sugar was over 700 . \nA normal level is below 125 . \nJONAS : My commitment to myself when I was on my way to the hospital was that I would not let this slow me down . \nGUPTA : Nick has learned to live with his disease and has n't let it get in the way of the Jonas Brothers ' success . \nTwo and a half years after his diagnosis , on a day when Nick says his blood sugar was a little out of control , he wrote a song about having diabetes . \nHe says writing `` A Little Bit Longer '' was therapy for him , and fans have told him it 's helped them cope as well . \nJONAS : I think just the fact that I can say , look , you 're just like everybody else , you can do what you want to do , and you can do it with diabetes , that 's the best thing in the world . \nGUPTA : Jonas says he is thankful to be able to do what he loves and uses his fame to educate people about the disease . \nWith the Jonas Brothers Change for the Children Foundation , Nick has been raising awareness and funds for diabetes research for several years now . \nJONAS : What we can do financially is great and I 'm always happy to do that , but if there is something that I can do personally to inspire or encourage somebody , that means the world . \nAZUZ : Before we go , during a timeout at a women 's college basketball game , one of the school 's officials was randomly chosen from the audience to try a half-court shot . \nMr. Showoff decides he 's gonna do it backwards . \nThere 's no way this is going to work , right ? \nHe won a set of brand new tires in the process . \nNow , we could n't make sense of a pun about a backwards basket . \nAZUZ : I mean , we gave it a shot , but it just went over our heads . \nGosh , we just never tire of this . \nSigning off for the next 23 hours and 50 minutes , this ... is ...

\nWEDEMAN : Becky , the -- the online activism has always been an interesting part of Egypt . \nBut until now , we would tend to see a lot of online activism that never really got translated into street action . \nAnd today , though , I think they 've really crossed that rubicon . \nWhat we 've seen is that this demonstration was , indeed , organized by two online groups working together that spread the word , as you said , through Facebook with one of those Facebook groups getting more than 300,000 followers . \nAnd word -- it spread , also , by word of mouth , by SMSes , so that , you know , we were really expecting little , small pockets of demonstrations , 200 or 300 apiece . \nSo when I saw thousands of people pouring into the heart of Cairo , I realized that this was not your run of the mill demonstration . \nAnd clearly , Twitter , Facebook , SMSes played a huge role in helping organize this -- Becky . \nANDERSON : Ben , you 've been recently in -- in Tunisia , covering what has become known as the Jasmine Revolution . \nHow does what you 've seen on the streets and what you 're hearing in Cairo compare to what you heard and saw in Tunis ? \nWEDEMAN : Well , I worked in Tunisia during the time of the old regime , of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali . \nAnd it was a much more repressive regime than the one in Egypt . \nYou know , there , you really could n't talk in public about politics . \nThe press was very strictly controlled . \nHere , you have a much more liberal press . \nEgyptians are free to say whatever they want . \nThe line is drawn when they start doing what they want , when they start holding demonstrations . \nSo there 's -- there 's a big difference . \nOn the other hand , you do have many of the same ills of society , so to speak , in Egypt that existed in Tunisia . \nYou have a declining economy . \nYou have rising costs of living . \nYou have a lot of corruption within the government and , of course , you have a president who 's been in office for longer than most Egyptians have been alive . \nSo there are important differences , but important similarities , as well -- Becky . \nANDERSON : Ben Wedeman reporting from Cairo . \nBen , thank you for that . \nEgypt 's foreign ministry spokesman said it 's important to put these protests into perspective . \nHe says the demonstrators represent only a fraction of Cairo 's population . \nAnd he says it 's telling that they were even allowed to openly protest against the government . \nHOSSAMI ZAKI , EGYPTIAN FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESMAN : This country has known freedom much unprecedented in this region , in Arab countries , at least . \nThis is something that has not been seen -- protesters being protected in the street , not being harassed , not being killed in the streets , like we have seen recently by -- by other regimes . \nThis is a totally different situation . \nSo we have to put things in perspective and not allow over zealots to qualify the situation by things that they 're -- that it is not . \nSo we have to be very careful here . \nANDERSON : Why do n't we just qualify what was said there after that interview , in fact , reports that one protester has died and another policeman has died to date in those protests . \nWell , the United States , an ally of the Egyptian government , says it believes the country is stable despite the unrest . \nSecurity -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton sounded confident today in Egypt 's ability to address the people 's grievances . \nThis is what she said . \nCLINTON : We support the fundamental right of expression and assembly for all people . \nAnd we urge that all parties exercise restraint and refrain from violence . \nBut our assessment is that the Egyptian government is stable and is looking for ways to respond to the legitimate needs and interests of the Egyptian people . \nANDERSON : Well , one of Egypt 's top opposition leaders takes issue with Hillary Clinton 's remarks that the Egyptian government is stable . \nI talked earlier with Mohamed ElBaradei , a former head of the UN 's nuclear watchdog who is now at the forefront of a push for political change in his country . \nMOHAMED ELBARADEI , FORMER IAEA CHIEF : I was stunned to hear , you know , Secretary Clinton saying that the Egyptian government is stable . \nAnd I asked myself , at what price is stability ? \nIs it on the basis of 29 years of martial law ? \nIs it on the basis of 30 years of a codified regime ? \nIs it on the basis of rigged elections ? \nThat 's not stability . \nThat is living on a borrowed time . \nStability is when you have a government that is elected on a free and fair basis . \nAnd we have seen , you know , how the election has been rigged in Egypt . \nWe have seen how people have been tortured . \nAnd when you see today almost over 100,000 young people getting desperate , going to the streets , asking for their basic freedoms , I expected to hear from Secretary Clinton stuff like , you know , democracy , human rights , basic freedoms -- all the stuff the U.N. is standing for . \nANDERSON : I want to just show our viewers a Tweet from you from a couple of days ago . \nAnd I quote : `` Threats of violence against participants in peaceful demonstrations reveal the ugly face of a regime terrified of its own people . '' \nMohamed , you 've been encouraging people to take to the streets . \nELBARADEI : Because I 've been , Becky , trying for a year to engage the regime through peaceful means by collecting signatures on demands for free and fair elections , for opening the door for Egyptians to run for the presidency , for having a parliament that 's representative of the people . \nWhen you have a parliament right now that have opposition of 3 percent , you 're already insulting the intelligence of the people by trying to say this is a democratic system . \nANDERSON : I wonder whether it 's responsible to encourage people to took to the streets in protests that could cur -- turn deadly and also wonder why you have n't , Mohamed , taken part ? \nELBARADEI : Well , I did n't ask for people to took to the street , Becky . \nThis was completely initiated by the young people . \nI have n't taken part because , you know , I have -- we have to have a division of labor . \nI - - I ca n't get access to the media while I 'm in Egypt . \nI 'm completely blocked from getting access to the media . \nAnd I think it 's important for me to continue to speak about the plight of the Egyptian people . \nAnd , unfortunately , I have to get out of Egypt to be able to speak about the plight of the Egyptians . \nANDERSON : Mohamed , let me bring up a Facebook site here , ElBaradei for presidency of Egypt . \nThere are more than 200,000 Facebook fans there , which begs the question , will you run for president ? \nELBARADEI : Becky , the priority for me is to -- is to shift Egypt into a democracy , is to catch up with the 21st century , to get Egypt to be a modern and moderne -- moderate society and respecting human rights , respecting the basic freedoms of the people . \nWhether I run or not , that is totally irrelevant . \nAnd I made it very clear , I will not run under the present conditions , when the deck is stacked completely . \nANDERSON : Mohamed , was the Jasmine Revolution that we 've seen in Tunisia just the start of things to come in the region ? \nELBARADEI : It sent a message everywhere to the -- to the Arab world , Becky , that , to quote Barack Obama , `` Yes , we can , '' you know , that it is -- it is doable . \nThen that we can be empowered as people to change a system that is ossified , that is completely repressive of our own basic rights . \nANDERSON : Do you fear for your own safety at this point ? \nELBARADEI : Well , that 's a good question . \nThere was an edict against me , you know , a couple of weeks ago basically saying that my life should -- should be dispensable because I am defying the rulers , you know . \nSo I have no security when I -- when I go to Egypt . \nI -- I 'm going to Egypt in the next few days . \nAnd this is a good question , Becky . \nBut , you know , you have to be with your people . \nANDERSON : Mohamed ElBaradei speaking to me earlier from Vienna . \nNow , a new prime minister in Lebanon backed by Hezbollah . \nHis offer of inclusion met with outrage by critics . \nA look at Lebanon 's uncertain future and present day fury , up next . \nAlso this hour , U.S. President Obama 's second State of the Union Address just hours away . \nBy the end of the day , they just may be calling his speech the state of the U.S. economy . \nAnd then a half hour CONNECT THE WORLD special from the bottom of the hour on the world 's wild weather . \nWe 're going to ask experts if this current period of weather extremes is the new normal . \nI 'm Becky Anderson in London . \nWe 're back in 60 seconds . \nANDERSON : Well , in just under five hours from now , U.S. President Obama will deliver his second State of the Union Address . \nYet while the president will talk of investing in America 's future , many will be looking to see whether he can reverse the debilitating spending patterns of the past . \nIt 's a tough balancing act . \nIn just a few minutes , we 'll look at whether Mr. Obama has what it takes to achieve it . \nI 'm Becky Anderson in London for you . \nYou 're watching CONNECT THE WORLD this hour here on CNN . \nAnd a look at the other stories that we are following for you . \nAnd a dramatic shift in the balance of power in Lebanon triggers a day of rage . \nHezbollah 's choice for prime minister has been tapped to form the next government . \nHe says he 's extending his hand to all factions . \nBut as Nic Robertson now reports , that did n't stop Hezbollah opponents from taking their fury to the streets . \nNIC ROBERTSON , CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : Well , within minutes of being announced as interim prime minister , Najib Miqati came on television saying that he was extending his hand to all political leaders to join him in a government he says he wants to focus on people 's issues and economic issues . \nBut we 've already heard from outgoing prime minister , Saad Hariri , that he will not be part of that government , which throws into question how influenced will this government be by Hezbollah . \nHezbollah 's leader appeared on television today , saying that if Hariri does n't want to be in this government , that means he only wants power to himself . \nBut what we 've seen through the day is Saad Hariri 's supporters coming out on the streets in some violent demonstrations in the north , in Tripoli , burning a satellite truck belonging to the news network , Al Jazeera ; in Beirut , as well , clashes between the army and stone-throwing Hariri supporters . \nBut this evening , it seems that the temperature is going down on those demonstrations . \nNot far from here , early evening , a relatively peaceful demonstration of Hariri supporters , several hundred of them . \nBut they 're all saying that they 're not going to give up on their support for Hariri and what they want , the investigation into the -- his father 's , Rafik Hariri 's death . \nHowever , under this new government that 's been proposed by -- that 's being proposed by Hezbollah , it does seem very likely that Lebanon will end its support for the U.N. special tribunal on Lebanon and the investigation into Rafik Hariri 's death . \nIt 's not fixed yet , but that 's the anticipation here . \nNic Robertson , CNN , Beirut , Lebanon . \nANDERSON : Well , the Russian president , Dmitry Medvedev , says lax security at Moscow 's Domodedovo Airport allowed a suicide bomber to sneak in and kill 35 people on Monday . \nA hundred and fifty-two others were wounded . \nWell , Mr. Medvedev says airport officials in charge of security must be punished . \nHe adds : `` Russia will step up security measures at airports , employing tactics now used in the U.S. and in Israel . '' \nPresident Vladimir Putin vowed harsh retribution for those who planned the attack . \nThere are reports that investigators believe a woman from the Muslim North Caucasus Region set off the bomb , but that can not , as yet , be confirmed . \nWell , first we heard reports that Palestinian Authority negotiators had offered to give Israel a significant part of East Jerusalem . \nNow it is a big concession over what 's known at the right of return . \nAl Jazeera news network is reporting more leaked documents uncovering secret peace talks , documents the Palestinian Authority characterizes as -- and I know that -- `` distortions and lies . '' \nKevin Flower with an update for you . \nKEVIN FLOWER , CNN JERUSALEM BUREAU CHIEF : The second wave of leaked documents dubbed the Palestine Papers by the Al Jazeera news network were released late last night and their impact continues to be felt in the West Bank , the Gaza Strip and beyond . \nThe most recent documents appear to show that Palestinian negotiators privately agreed to accept a very limited right of return for the some five million Palestinian refugees and descendents who were forced or fled from their homes in the 1948 war that created the state of Israel . \nSpecifically , the documents suggest that Palestinian Authority officials agreed to a , quote , `` symbolic return of refugees numbering at just 1,000 a year for the course of 10 years . '' \nThe right of return is a hugely sensitive topic for both Palestinians and Israelis and it remains one of the key sticking points in achieving a peace deal . \nSo making concessions on the issue from either side carries huge political risk . \nANDERSON : Well , a British football commentator has been acknowledged after making sexist comments about a female match official . \nIn a statement , Sky Sports said Andy Gray 's contract had been terminated for what they say is unacceptable behavior . \nThe football pundit was caught twice on tape making derogatory comments about assistant referee , seen here , Sian Massey . \nAnd the Oscar nominations are out . \nAnd `` The King 's Speech '' leads a crowded field , with 12 nods . \nThe movie chronicles King George VI 's struggles with stuttering and the Australian man who used unorthodox methods to treat him . \nAnd a look for you at all 10 nominees for best film . \nYou 'll see `` The King 's Speech '' up there at the top . \nMoving down , you 've got `` The Fighter , '' `` True Grit , '' `` Black Swan '' in there , `` The Kids Are All Right '' and right down to `` Winter 's Bone '' . \nHere are the best actress nominees . \nAmong them , Nicole Kidman and Natalie Portman and dark horse choice , Jennifer Lawrence . \nBest actor nominees including Jeff Bridges , Colin Firth and the Academy Awards co-host , James Franco . \nThe winners will be announced in Hollywood on February the 27th . \nYou 're watching CONNECT THE WORLD here on CNN . \nI 'm Becky Anderson in London for you . \nUp next , he walks to the podium later tonight with some Democrats and Republicans sitting side by side . \nBut will President Barack Obama 's second State of the Union Address be well received by both parties ? \nAnd what about the Tea Party ? \nWe 'll have a preview from the White House for you . \nAfter that , batten down the hatches -- extreme weather across the globe . \nYou 've seen it . \nYou 've heard it . \nWe ask if it 's here to stay . \nANDERSON : Well , how do you keep America competitive in a changing world ? \nWell , that is the question that U.S. President Obama will attempt to answer tonight when he delivers his second what 's known as a State of the Union Address . \nNow , Mr. Obama is expected to call for new investment in education and innovation to help create jobs . \nYet the president will also have to prove to a divided Congress that he is serious about cutting the deficit . \nLet 's kick off with Dan Lothian for you . \nDAN LOTHIAN , CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Well , this is a very important speech for the president , which he will be delivering later tonight . \nThe broad themes that the White House says the president will be focusing on , job creation , not only in the short-term , but in the long haul . \nThe president also will be focusing on deficit reduction . \nAnd then two key words that they 've been throwing around here at the White House quite a bit we 'll also here during the president 's speech -- innovation and competitiveness -- how to help the United States succeed and win on the global stage . \nI 'm told by a senior aide that the president will be rolling out a plan on how to win . \nSome of those things we 've heard before . \nOthers , though , I 'm told will be new concepts . \nAnd then one other thing in tradition from these State of the Union Addresses the president will always honor some guests by inviting them to sit in the first lady 's box . \nThis year is no different . \nWe 're being told that the family members of the 9-year-old girl who was shot in Arizona have been invited , along with one of Representative Giffords ' doctors from Arizona and also a young man , an intern for Representative Giffords , who 's being hailed a hero . \nHis name is Daniel Hernandez . \nAll of them have been invited to watch the speech from the first lady 's box . \nDan Lothian reporting from the White House . \nWell , CNN , of course , will have live coverage of U.S. President Barack Obama 's State of the Union Address . \nFor our European viewers , it all starts at 2:00 in the morning London time , 3:00 a.m. . \nAnd wherever you are watching in the world , you can work out the time from those , at 2:00 GMT , of course , in London . \nWhile the U.S. continues to talk of investment , in Britain , the government is pursuing a very different policy . \nYet even before a severe program of spending cuts could take effect , there was some worrying news today for the U.K. economy . \nUnexpectedly , the nation 's GDP shrank by 0.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2010 . \nBritain 's finance minister blamed the weather . \nGEORGE OSBORNE , U.K. FINANCE MINISTER : It was the coldest December for 100 years . \nPeople could n't get to work . \nAnd that 's had a bigger impact than anyone forecast . \nBut if you look at areas not so affected by the weather , like manufacturing , they are growing . \nThere 's an important part of rebalancing the British economy . \nAnd if we were to abandon our budget plans and not face up to the debts , as the way that Labor suggests , then we would be back in a financial crisis that would be a disaster for Britain . \nAnd this government is not going to be blown off course by bad weather . \nANDERSON : All right , well , despite Mr. Osborne 's defiance , some fear the U.K. 's economy may not be strong enough to withstand the government 's tough austerity measures . \nRichard Quest is at the World Economic Forum all week in Davos in Switzerland . \nAnd earlier , we talked about the significance of today 's contraction in the U.K. ahead of these pretty severe spending cuts . \nThis is what he said . \nRICHARD QUEST , HOST , QUEST MEANS BUSINESS : The U.K. is the laboratory rat , the experimental territory , if you like , for austerity , the poster child for measures designed to cut budget deficits . \nThat 's why everybody is looking at the U.K. economy , which is by no means the most important in the world . \nBut what Cameron 's governing coalition has done is put such strong austerity measures in place and now , potentially , seeing even the reaction of -- on confidence , that that 's been the big question and talking point . \nHaving said that , this weather anomaly , Becky , is so unusual and so congenital -LRB- ph -RRB- and so obscure that we really do n't know what the long-term effect would be . \nANDERSON : What we do know is that we will hear from President Obama today , much talk of not austerity , but stimulus measures again . \nIs that correct , do you think , at this point in the economic cycle ? \nQUEST : I think President Obama 's job is to walk this very difficult line between talking up the economy but also recognizing , as both sides do , that there has to be some form of cutback . \nNow , once you 've said that cut , we can all -- they can all agree on that . \nAnd then the differences of opinion begin . \nInterestingly , Becky , you may -- it may not have been noticed too much today that the IMF , in its latest revision to global economy , does say that the stimulus package and the increased quantitative easing from the Fed has played an important role in keeping the U.S. economy going . \nBut on the political front tonight , with the State of the Union , it really is a case of everyone saying something must be done but I 'm not going to do it . \nDavos really sort of kicking off tomorrow morning , Wednesday , in Switzerland . \nWhat do you expect to be the key talking points , Richard ? \nAnd how will this austerity versus stimulus argument play , do you think ? \nQUEST : I do n't think it will . \nI do n't -- I think the -- the issue now is quite clear . \nThere has to be cuts to government spending . \nThere has to be a transference of debt from government back to the private sector , as the private sector has to start pulling economies out of the mile -LRB- ph -RRB- that they 're in . \nThere 's pretty much agreement on that . \nThe timing may be the issue . \nWhere I think Davos is going to play a major role is how -- they 're going to talk , obviously , about the food crisis ; but also , handling this shift in global growth from the developed to the developing economies , the -- the , if you like , from the West to the East , North to the South . \nBut that is going to be what people are talking about here . \nANDERSON : Richard Quest in Davos . \nDo remember , you can see the State of the Union Address , of course , here on CNN . \nYou 're watching CONNECT THE WORLD . \nUp next , a topic that we all talk about -- the weather . \nIt 's made news headlines worldwide in the past 21 months , as it brings destruction and death at frightening levels . \nAre we simply experiencing freak weather events or is this the future ? \nWe 're going to ask the experts , up next , a special program here on CNN . \nANDERSON : You 're back with CONNECT THE WORLD . \n2010 has been a deadly year of natural catastrophes . \nAnd already , 2011 is seeing its fair share of historic flooding . \nWhy , and what 's being done about it ? \nWell , in the next 30 minutes , we 're going to take a spin around the globe to look for some answers for you . \nThat is coming up here on CNN in the next half hour . \nBefore we do that , let 's get you a very quick check , as ever , of the headlines at this point . \nEgypt 's interior ministry says one demonstrator and one policeman were killed during anti-government protests across the country on Tuesday . \nThousands of people demanded more freedoms and the resignation of President Hosni Mubarak , inspired by Tunisia 's recent revolution . \nAnger , also , on the streets of Beirut . \nHezbollah opponents declared a day of rage after the group 's choice for prime minister was tapped to form a new government . \nBillionaire businessman Najib Mikati says he will reach out to all Lebanese factions . \nRussian president Dmitry Medvedev blames lax airport security for the suicide bombing that killed 35 people and injured 152 at Moscow 's busiest airport . \nHe says airport security officials should face punishment . \nPrime minister Vladimir Putin vows harsh retribution for whoever planned the attack . \nAnd mixed economic news led to a flat finish on Wall Street . \nThe blue chips slid ever so slightly , dropping 3 points to close at 11,977 . \nWatch out for the State of the Union address later tonight . \nAnd -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE : La la la la la -- COLIN FIRTH AS KING GEORGE VI , `` THE KING 'S SPEECH '' : Up comes the royal hand . \nHELENA BONHAM CARTER AS QUEEN ELZABETH , `` THE KING 'S SPEECH '' : That should quite -- ANDERSON : A scene from `` The King 's Speech , '' which has been nominated for 12 Academy Awards , including Best Picture and Support -- Supporting Actress , Actor , and Supporting Actor . \nI got that one wrong , did n't I ? \nOther films to get a Best Picture Oscar include `` The Social Network '' and `` Black Swan . '' \nThose are your headlines this hour . \nANDERSON : From Australia to Brazil , Pakistan , and more . \nIn just the last few months , the world has endured weather events that are historic in their extremes . \nSo , is it a trend , or are these events near outliers , a matter of coincidence over time ? \nWell , welcome to a half-hour special on CONNECT THE WORLD . \nI 'm Becky Anderson . \nIn the next 30 minutes , we 'll have a report from CNN 's Weather Center examining the data , and perspectives from our correspondents in New York , in Islamabad , and in Rio . \nAnd I 'm happy to say , tonight , that we 're joined by two experts , here . \nRobert Watson charged -- or , chaired the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for five years . \nHe now teaches at the University of East Anglia , a major player in climate research . \nAnd from Copenhagen , this evening , we have Bjorn Lomborg . \nHe 's best-known for his book `` The Skeptical Environmentalist . '' \nHe believes that global warming is serious , but not the end of the world . \nGentlemen , we thank you for joining us . \nI 'm going to come to you very shortly . \nTo make sense of what 's been going on around the world , first , let 's take a quick look back , shall we ? \nREZA SAYAH , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : Record monsoon rains and landslides continue to wreak havoc in Pakistan , and the death toll and destruction continue to increase . \nANDERSON -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Summer 2010 . \nThe rainy season that 's also the lifeblood of Pakistan became a killer . \nThe Indus River , swollen by two months of incessant rain , broke its banks , sweeping everything in its path , homes , villages , livelihoods . \nANDERSON -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Nearly 2,000 people were killed , and a further 20 million were affected in what became Pakistan 's worst natural disaster . \nSo sever were the floods , they caused an estimated $ 9.5 billion damage . \nAnd today , more than six months on , two million people are still dependent on aid and waiting to rebuild their lives . \nAt the same time , record rainfall in China caused floods and mudslides , which killed more than 3,200 people . \nAll told , some 117 million people were affected . \nThe damage bill , almost double that of the Pakistan flood disaster , estimated at $ 18 billion . \nAccording to the United Nations , summer 2010 was deadly for some 56,000 people in Russia for an entirely different reason . \nAn unprecedented heatwave , abnormally high temperatures wilting crops and sparking wildfires . \nThen , in December , extremes on the other side of the scale . \nATIKA SHUBERT , CNN CORRESPONDENT : It 's more travel misery for anybody trying to catch a flight out of Heathrow Airport , today . \nMore than half of the scheduled flights have been canceled today . \nANDERSON -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : A rare , icy blast hit Europe and the United States , grounding flights in the lead-up to the holiday period , stranding motorists on highways and residents in their homes . \nAnd just this month , more devastating floods . \nQueensland in Australia has been hit by what authorities described as an inland tsunami . \nEntire neighborhoods were swamped in rising waters , which to date have claimed 35 lives . \nThe deluge washing away memories of a decade-long drought in a matter of days and leaving thousands with an uncertain future . \nANNA BLIGH , PREMIER OF QUEENSLAND : We 're the ones that they knock down , and we get up again . \nI said earlier this week that this weather may break our hearts , and it is doing that . \nBut it will not break our will . \nANDERSON -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Australians are still bracing for more floods . \nThe agony continues , too , for Brazil . \nSHASTA DARLINGTON , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : This is the landscape that the rescue workers are having to deal with . \nAs you can see , the rivers still fill up quickly with rain . \nThey have to dig through this mud . \nThey 've got some sniffer dogs out here . \nBut what they 're looking for are bodies . \nANDERSON -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Days of torrential rains have caused floods and mudslides that , so far , have killed more than 800 people . \nRescue efforts continue , and sometimes there is success . \nANDERSON -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : But the toll is expected to climb in this Brazilian disaster , just one of many around the world caused by severe weather events . \nEvents the United Nations warns we can expect more of in the future , due to factors including climate change , making it critical to put better plans in place now . \nANDERSON : Remarkable stuff when you see it . \nWe 've also seen severe flooding , of course , in the past six months in Colombia , Sri Lanka , and various other places . \nSouth Africa , Thailand , the list goes on . \nSo , what is happening ? \nLet 's bring in our guests . \nRobert Watson of the University of East Anglia and , of course , Bjorn Lomborg from Copenhagen . \nA simple question , Robert . \nWhat is going on ? \nROBERT WATSON , PROFESSOR , UNIVERSITY OF EAST ANGLIA : Well , the climate 's always variable . \nAnd , indeed , climate change caused by human activities might make it both more variable and more extreme in the future . \nBut as early as last October , there were projections that we would have a cold , early winter in England . \nAnd projections there would be intense rainfall throughout Australia or the northern part of Australia , through southeast Asia all the way to Sri Lanka . \nIt 's called a so-called `` La Nina . '' \nWhat that does is it -- the waters get very cold off of Ecuador , the Pacific . \nAnd this is the probably the strongest La Nina in 100 years . \nSo , this very cold water three , four , five degrees colder than normal , sort of moved towards Australia , but there was warm water up by Australia , lots of evaporation . \nWhat goes up must come down , very , very heavy rainfalls in place . \nANDERSON : Yes , all right . \nYou 're referencing La Nina . \nYou also alluded , there , to global warming . \nLa Nina , global warming , or something else ? \nBJORN LOMBORG , AUTHOR , `` THE SKEPTICAL ENVIRONMENTALIST '' : Well , it 's definitely consistent with global warming in the sense that we know that there 's going to be more extreme precipitation , as we saw in Pakistan and Rio and many other places . \nBut what we have to remember is , in our rush , in many green groups and also some of the media 's rush to blame global warming , we neglect the fact that many of these catastrophes certainly have a very large manmade element in the sense that , for instance , in Pakistan , they cleared the upper riv -- forests , which makes flooding more likely . \nThe population of Pakistan has quadrupled over the last 60 years . \nA lot of people moving in on the flood plains , making it much harder not to have rivers flow over somewhere because they are diked in everywhere . \nAnd also , you have poor water infrastructure in Pakistan and many other places . \nAnd this is important , because if we say `` this is due to global warming , '' then our tendency will be , as your reporter just said , we should do something about global warming , we should cut carbon emissions . \nNow , this is a good idea . \nBut trying to help Pakistan and Rio by cutting carbon emissions is an incredibly bad way to help them , fundamentally , because it 's infrastructure that 's the most important part . \nAnd because cutting carbon emissions is rather expensive and will really only help a tiny bit in a hundred years . \nWATSON : Bjorn 's right . \nIt 's a combination of natural climate variability , possibly more extreme events because of human-induced climate change , and bad infrastructure . \nIn many places of the world , we 've denuded our forests , let our hillsides erode and , therefore , it 's a combination of weather and the way we 've managed our infrastructure . \nSo , Bjorn 's absolutely right . \nWe need to take a more holistic view of looking at infrastructure and looking at climate change together . \nIt 's not one or the other , it 's how we manage the system holistically . \nANDERSON : We can forecast some of the weather cycles , one assumes . \nAnd as Bjorn says , and Bjorn , I 'll bring you in , here , we could probably gauge what will happen if we have , as you say , denuded these areas where people live . \nAre we doing a good enough job at either of those at this point ? \nLOMBORG : No , of course we 're not . \nOne of the great examples where there was the hurricane that hit Myanmar , Burma , a couple of years ago . \nHad these people been informed , they would have had a much better chance at dealing with this , and probably we would n't have seen more than 100,000 lives being perished . \nSo , we need to make sure we get much better information , as Robert also said earlier , we had good indication that much of this was going to happen . \nWe certainly know this for Europe , for instance , in Britain , there was good indications there was going to be a cold winter . \nAnd yet , there was very little preparation . \nVery clearly , this is about saying , in the first instance , let 's prepare better . \nIn the second place , let 's make sure we deal with our infrastructure so we 're much more robust . \nAnd , of course , in the third sense , we also need to tackle global warming . \nBut let 's not try to say that that 's the way to help Pakistan or Rio or the other places in the first instance . \nLet 's take a look at a couple of those . \nPaul writes , `` Just more hype , '' he says . \n`` The weather is the weather and is chaotic as ever . \nThe difference between today and former times is that we now know instantly about something happening on the other side of the Earth . '' \nThis is a very good point , I guess . \nDavid believes `` It is just the Earth going through a cycle . \nAll the environmentalists want to blame global warming on everything . \nYou ca n't have it both ways . '' \nBriefly , your thoughts . \nWATSON : Climate is variable , but there 's actually no doubt the Earth is warming , and we can not explain it on natural phenomena . \nThe only we can explain it is invoking human-induced activities , the way we produce energy and use energy , putting greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere , the way we 've deforested large parts of the world . \nThere 's no question that we humans are starting to change the Earth 's climate . \nAs you do that , we would expect more of these extreme weather events . \nMore floods , more droughts , more heatwaves . \nSo , it 's a combination of manage your energy , managing our land , as Bjorn says , managing our infrastructure . \nAnd countries have realized that when you denude a forest , for example , in the Yangtze River in China many years ago , they got the same rainfall as they might have had earlier , but when it was just bare ground , there 's only one thing that can happen , and that 's major floods , displacement of people . \nSo , we have to look at an integrated land-management with the way we deal with climate and weather . \nANDERSON : You 're both making very good points tonight . \nI 'm going to take a very short break . \nI can see you wanting to jump in at this point , Bjorn . \nWe 're going to talk about the future coming up next . \nThen , we 're going to ask , historically , how bad are these pictures that we are seeing . \nJenny Harrison from the Weather Center looks at some of the key data to break it down for us . \nPlus , holding government to account . \nWhat are people in power doing in response to all this extreme weather ? \nOur team of correspondents on the ground and our guests in the studio will have something to say on that . \nThat coming up on CNN . \nANDERSON : Japan on their way to beating South Korea on penalties in the semifinals of the Asian Cup in Qatar . \nNow , organizers have announced that they will donate the money from Tuesday 's matches to flood victims in Australia , in Thailand , and in Sri Lanka . \nThey hope to raise $ 300,000 to help people rebuild their lives after the devastation . \nJust a few of the powerful images that we 've seen from around the world as heavy rains and mudslides take their toll . \nBut historically , how bad are things at the moment ? \nI want to bring in meteorologist Jenny Harrison from the CNN Weather Center , who 's going to walk us through some of the data . \nI 'm here for you , Jen . \nWe 're all here for you . \nJENNY HARRISON , CNN METEOROLOGIST : Yes , you 're right . \nLet 's take a little look back and actually , let 's start out with , perhaps , the most recent event , which is , of course , the flooding in areas of Australia . \nWe 're heading first of all to Rockhampton . \nThis is the before image , one of those very useful Google Earth images . \nThis particular image taken on the 9th of January . \nAnd just look at all this brown area . \nThis , of course , is the areas that are , indeed , under water . \nBut again , when you look at historically -- this is what , of course , we 're trying to discern and talk about right now -- in the year 2011 , 9.2 meters , that was the level of flooding , that was the flood reach -- the flood levels as the reached in along the Fitzroy River . \nBut when you go back historically , not quite as high as years before . \n1954 , 1918 , both two very memorable years for the amount of flooding that took place . \nHowever , what we saw in the lead-up to the event in 2011 , an extremely wet December , where we saw five times the average amount of rainfall and a tropical cyclone that also came ashore , bringing , of course , those extra amounts of rainfall . \nThen , in Brisbane , a similar sort of story . \nAgain , a very , very wet December , so some very saturated ground . \nAnd then , the Brisbane River , these lines you can see here , the green , the blue , the red , showing you the red line is the major area of the flooding . \nWhat happened in 2011 ? \nThis was the level , again , that flood -- that the river actually reached . \nBut you 'll notice these blue areas , these lines here , just above that red . \nSo , six times , as far as we can tell in the last 150 years , the river actually did reach a higher level than that . \nNow , I 'm going to take you on to Brazil . \nNow , this , perhaps , more of an event that takes place , shall we say , during the summer months just about every year . \nWe have to the south is the inter-tropical convergence zone . \nThis , here , which is the convergence zone , the South Atlantic . \nAnd so , we see these thunderstorms forming along this line just about all throughout the summer months every year . \nAs they tend to , of course , the strongest in the afternoon and the evening hours , the locations can vary very much , but what happened is we saw some very heavy amounts of rain , very , very mountainous topography , of course . \nAnd these are the numbers that were affected , in fact . \nKilled over 800 just recently , you go back to 2010 . \nAnd then , 1967 , in a similar region , estimated over 400 people . \nFrom there , we just look at Pakistan . \nThis was pretty much an unprecedented amount of rain that fell . \nDuring 1956 , in the entire month they did n't see as much rain that came down in 24 hours , 274 millimeters , nearly six times the average amount of rain . \nFlash floods , of course , but then , that rain had to go somewhere , into the Indus River and , my goodness , it takes a while for that rain , of course , to flow southwards into those open waters , Becky . \nANDERSON : Yes , and you 've got our guest , here , nodding away at those facts . \nJenny , thank you very much for that . \nOur two experts with us tonight , Robert Watson , who chaired the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for five years , now a professor , of course , at the University of East Anglia . \nAnd Bjorn Lomborg in Copenhagen , author of `` The Skeptical Environmentalist '' and a professor at the Copenhagen Business School . \nAs I say , you were nodding sagely at what Jenny had said . \nThese extreme weather events do occur . \nThey 're natural phenomena . \nSo , we 've seen large floods before , we 've seen heatwaves before . \nThe way we 've changed our landscape , as Bjorn said , has actually made us even more vulnerable to these floods when you have heavy precipitation . \nWhat we 're also saying is , in a warmer world , potentially caused by human activities , these types of events will become more frequent . \nSo , we 've seen them in the past , they 're natural events , we 'll se them in the future . \nThe question is whether they 'll become more extreme or more frequent . \nANDERSON : Bjorn , what happens -- what do you say when people say to you , `` Hang on a minute , '' you 're talking about global warming , you 've heard what Robert said here , but what about me trudging through the snow this November and December ? \nI 've never seen anything of the like in the UK . \nIt was one of the coldest winters we 've ever had . \nLOMBORG : And I think this very well shows the problem of us launching into saying , `` Oh , this is all global warming . '' \nWhile Robert is right , that this is partially consistent with what we would expect to see in a warmer world , telling every time we see a heatwave or every time we see a particularly hot summer or a lot of flooding , `` this is global warming , '' then , of course , every time it snows really much , you 're going to have people say , `` Oh , see ? \nThere 's nothing to this global warming thing . '' \nWe 've got to stop having weather as a way of arguing global warming . \nGlobal warming is real , it is a problem that we 'll need to face up with . \nBut likewise with -- I do n't know if you remember . \nBack in 2005 , the big story was Hurricane Katrina and the way that global warming had affected that . \nBut partly , of course , remember we virtually have n't seen any big hurricanes since then . \nNow , this does n't mean that global warming will not probably slightly affect the impact of really large hurricanes , but it also shows that we end up focusing on the wrong thing . \nBecause if you wanted to help people in New Orleans , should you try to cut carbon emissions -- ? \nLOMBORG : Or should you build better levees ? \nANDERSON : Robert , I 'm going to leave the last point to you . \nI -- for our viewers ' sake , what is in store in the future ? \nWATSON : Well , we need to do both , in my opinion . \nWe need to build better infrastructure and address global warming . \nWe need to do that . \nBut he was also right . \nWe can not attribute every heatwave , every storm to climate change . \nAll you can say is , these events occur naturally , and more will occur in the future . \nSo , I believe what we need to do is address the issue of global warming , we do need to cut our carbon emissions , we do need to start to prepare for a warmer world , we need to adapt our road systems , our infrastructure , our agricultural systems , et cetera , so it 's a balanced portfolio of development , both in developing and developed countries , and addressing climate change all at the same time . \nAnd , in fact , as I said in October of this year , we did project it would be a cold , early winter . \nWe did project the floods , the types of floods you might see in Australia . \nThe point I would also like to make is , even in a warmer world , human-induced climate change , we will see very heavy snowfall . \nThere 'll still be more precipitation into the atmosphere and it will still be cold enough to snow , so heavy snowfall is still consistent with a warmer world . \nANDERSON : Work that one out . \nGuys , we thank you very much , indeed , for joining us tonight . \nDevastating floods hit Pakistan in 2010 , what 's the government there doing to limit death and destruction in the future . \nAnd what about in Brazil ? \nHave officials there learned anything from the recent floods and mudslides ? \nSome lessons for the future , coming up next , here on CONNECT THE WORLD . \nANDERSON : With floods threatening human lives around the world , how are animals faring ?

'' \n`` There have been lots of civil wars . \nThere 's been lots of societies in turmoil . \nBut this kind of phenomenon where you had crowds peacefully coming into the streets to demand a change in their own contract with their government -- in the Arab world proper , this is the first time it 's happened and it 's the first time since 1979 in the Middle East , '' Cole told CNN last week . \nHe noted that Tunisia is the `` most secular country in the Arab world . '' \nIts traditions have favored women 's rights and its Islamist influence is negligible . \nTunisia also lacked the oil resources of other Arab states and the ethnic divisions seen in other Middle Eastern countries , which make it harder for opposition movements to unite , he noted . \nCould Cairo be the next Tunis ? \nGallery : Protesters fill the streets in Egypt Looking at the protests Tuesday in Cairo , Mamoun Fandy of the International Institute for Strategic Studies told CNN he was not seeing a `` turning point or tipping point yet . '' \nNoting the strength of the army , he said , `` The Egyptian system is too strong and too resilient . '' \nA key question that will show the potential strength of the demonstrations Tuesday is whether hardcore protesters will stay through the night , or whether the rallies will fizzle down , he said . \nEric Trager , a Ph.D. candidate in political science at the University of Pennsylvania and a former Fulbright fellow in Egypt , wrote in The Atlantic , `` Egypt 's liberal activists overwhelmingly come from the wired generation of Twitter and Facebook , and this makes them optimistic that pro-democratic movements can go viral , even in a political environment as traditionally illiberal as the Middle East . \n... Yet Egyptian activists face tremendous odds -- in particular , an entrenched dictatorship that is determined to discredit the very idea of domino-effect democratization . '' \nTime.com published a story Thursday from writer Abigail Hauslohner in Cairo headlined , `` After Tunisia : Why Egypt Is n't Ready to Have Its Own Revolution . '' \nSome Egyptians `` believe the time is now '' for protests to bring about change like in Tunisia , and several people in Egypt have set themselves on fire or attempted to in recent days -- much like the self-immolation of a young unemployed man in Tunisia that sparked protests in that country , '' she writes . \n`` But in Egypt , it does n't go much deeper than that . '' \nA greater percentage of Egypt 's population than Tunisia 's lives below the poverty line , she writes . \n`` The citizens of Egypt regularly complain of a neglectful regime that knows more about torture than it does about public service , and they 're furious with a regime that seems to swallow any domestic profits before they can reach the lower classes . \nAnd yet no one predicts a revolutionary reset anytime soon . '' \nTwo factors distinguish Egypt from Tunisia in this respect , Hauslohner writes : Tunisia 's government spent generously on education , creating a frustrated educated but unemployed population . \nAnd in Egypt , `` the military stands with '' Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak . \nTime.com is a partner of CNN.com . \nWriting in Newsweek , journalist Mike Giglio suggested the `` upcoming protest in Cairo could mark the beginning of another upheaval . '' \n`` Tuesday will be the first real test of whether the revolution is contagious , '' he wrote in a story published Monday . \nMany protesters believe their demonstrations will prove to have far more power than naysayers suggest . \nA Facebook page that has served to help organize Tuesday 's protests in Cairo says , `` Many young Egyptians are now fed up with the inhuman treatment they face on a daily basis in streets , police stations and everywhere . \n... Egyptians are aspiring to the day when Egypt has its freedom and dignity back , the day when the current 30 years long emergency martial law ends and when Egyptians can freely elect their true representatives .

'' \nGibbs reiterated the Obama administration 's opposition to any violence in the Egypt demonstrations , either by Egyptian security forces , protesters or criminal elements . \nHe added that if the Egyptian government is instigating any of the violence , `` it should stop immediately . '' \nAt the State Department , spokesman P.J. Crowley called the attacks by what he described as `` thugs '' a clear attempt to intimidate the anti-government protesters , who were demonstrating for a ninth straight day . \nThe United States does n't know the identity of the `` thugs , '' Crowley said , adding that others have identified them as `` supporters of the government . '' \nIn an operation that started Monday , more than 1,900 U.S. citizens and their family members have been evacuated from Egypt , Crowley said , adding that further evacuations would take place Thursday . \nThe attacks came the day after Mubarak announced he would not seek re-election as part of a series of political reforms . \nOpposition activists and protesters , however , said Mubarak must step down immediately with a caretaker unity government running the country until elections for president and a new parliament can take place . \nIt was unclear whether such confrontations were being repeated elsewhere . \nOther Cairo neighborhoods were calm , and contesting rallies in Egypt 's second largest city , Alexandria , were largely peaceful . \nGibbs said the time for a political transition in Egypt `` is now '' because the Egyptian people `` need to see change , '' and a `` meaningful transition must include opposition voices and parties being involved in this process as we move toward free and fair elections . '' \nAt the same time , Gibbs noted that events in Egypt `` have moved enormously quickly in a very volatile region of the world , '' adding : `` What we 're watching is history being made . '' \n"}
{"id": "44", "time": "2011-02-02", "text": "By the CNN Wire Staff Obama on Egypt : Change must happen now NEW : President Obama spoke to Egypt 's president on Tuesday NEW : Obama warns of difficult days ahead for Egypt and pledges continued partnership Mubarak announces he wo n't run for re-election An envoy for Obama urged Mubarak to drop his re-election plans Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Barack Obama warned Tuesday of `` difficult days ahead '' for Egypt and said the transition following President Hosni Mubarak 's earlier announcement that he wo n't run for re-election in September must begin immediately . \nIn a brief statement to reporters at the White House , Obama pledged continuing U.S. support for both a longtime ally and the aspirations of protesting Egyptians , whose eight days of growing demonstrations led to Mubarak 's dramatic announcement on state television . \n`` We 've borne witness to the beginning of a new chapter in the history of a great country and a long-time partner of the United States , '' Obama said of the Mubarak statement less than three hours earlier . \nNoting that he and Mubarak had just spoken by phone , Obama said Mubarak `` recognizes that the status quo is not sustainable and a change must take place . '' \nRepeating earlier calls for an orderly transition in Egypt from Mubarak 's nearly three decades of repressive rule to a fully representative democracy , Obama said the transition `` must be meaningful , it must be peaceful and it must begin now . '' \n`` Furthermore , the process must include a broad spectrum of Egyptian voices and opposition parties , '' Obama said . \n`` It should lead to elections that are free and fair . \nAnd it should result in a government that 's not only grounded in democratic principles but is also responsive to the aspirations of the Egyptian people . '' \nEarlier , sources told CNN that a U.S. envoy sent by Obama urged Mubarak to announce he wo n't run for re-election later this year , a major shift in foreign policy regarding the main Arab ally of the United States and a vital partner in the Middle East peace process because of its 1978 treaty with Israel . \nAccording to the sources , who spoke on condition of not being identified by name , former U.S. Ambassador to Egypt Frank Wisner conveyed the message to Mubarak in Egypt . \nIt was unclear if the meeting was Monday or Tuesday . \nUntil now , the street demonstrations in Egypt demanding Mubarak 's ouster had drawn a measured U.S. response that advocated step-by-step reforms for pro-democracy changes while maintaining stability . \nThis week , though , calls increased for the Obama administration to push for Mubarak to step aside immediately or announce he would not be a candidate in the next presidential election scheduled for September . \nOne of Egypt 's leading opposition figures , Mohamed ElBaradei , warned Monday that the United States needed to `` let go '' of its longtime ally . \n`` You should n't be behind the curve , and you need to start building confidence with the people and not with the people who are smothering the people , '' ElBaradei , the former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency , told CNN 's `` Anderson Cooper 360 . '' \nThe unrest in Egypt presented Obama with a complex issue that lacked easy answers . \nEgypt -- the main Arab ally of the United States -- is inexorably linked to neighboring Israel -- the main U.S. ally in the Middle East -- by a peace treaty that guarantees more than $ 1 billion a year in U.S. military aid to Mubarak 's government . \nEgypt also provides vital logistical and intelligence assistance to the United States , which has urged Mubarak for years to implement democratic reforms but always put the strategic benefits first . \nDaniel Kurtzer , the U.S. ambassador to Egypt from 1997 to 2001 , said the administration wants to both support `` an exceedingly strong ally '' and promote democratic reform and more openness in `` a closed authoritarian society . '' \n`` The United States is trying to find comfortable ground in which we can argue for both without abandoning an ally and without abandoning our principles , '' Kurtzer told CNN on Monday . \nEgypt 's turmoil follows years of social , political and economic grievances that fueled the street protests that began last week and have since escalated . \nAfter ruling with an iron fist for three decades , Mubarak had given no indication of giving up power before his statement Tuesday night . \nHowever , ElBaradei and other opposition figures immediately condemned Mubarak 's announcement as insufficient , saying the president needed to step aside immediately for a caretaker government of national unity to lead Egypt until new presidential and parliamentary elections can be held . \nObama 's statement avoided addressing the opposition demands , instead promising the demonstrators -- particularly young Egyptians looking to the United States for support and leadership -- that America supported their aspirations . \n`` We hear your voices , '' Obama said . \n`` I have an unyielding belief that you will determine your own destiny and seize the promise of a better future for your children and your grandchildren . \nAnd I say that as someone who is committed to a partnership between the United States and Egypt . \n`` There will be difficult days ahead , '' Obama continued . \n`` Many questions about Egypt 's future remain unanswered , but I am confident that the people of Egypt will find those answers . '' \nIn the past week , demonstrators in Egypt have questioned why Obama , who championed human rights and democracy in a 2009 speech in Cairo , was n't condemning Mubarak and applying pressure to help bring the changes they seek . \nElBaradei , who returned to his native Egypt last week as an opposition figure last week , said Egyptians need to see that the United States is supporting their aspirations . \n`` People need to see that you not only talk the talk , but walk the walk , and people need to understand and believe that you really , seriously take democracy , rule of law , freedoms seriously , '' ElBaradei said Sunday . \nAsking `` a dictator '' to implement democratic reforms `` is an oxymoron , frankly . '' \nOn Monday , White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said Egypt 's government should engage in `` meaningful negotiations with a broad section of civil society , including opposition groups , '' and hold `` free and fair elections '' in September . \nThe transition called for by the United States `` means change , and what we 've advocated from the very beginning is that the way Egypt looks and operates must change , '' Gibbs told reporters . \nAt the same time , he said it is not the place of the United States to support or oppose the possible ouster of Mubarak . \nSome U.S. politicians disagreed . \nOne of the U.S. Senate 's most influential foreign policy voices , Democrat John Kerry of Massachusetts , called Tuesday for Mubarak to step down , reflecting the rapidly changing consensus among top Washington policymakers . \nKerry , the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the 2004 Democratic presidential nominee , also said Mubarak 's son , Gamal , should not take the reins of power in Cairo . \nThe U.S. government needs to start paying closer attention to the `` genuine political , legal and economic needs '' of people in the Middle East , as opposed to consistently supporting friendly governments regardless of their domestic politics , Kerry said in an op-ed commentary published by the New York Times . \n`` For three decades , the United States pursued a Mubarak policy , '' he wrote . \n`` Now we must look beyond the Mubarak era and devise an Egyptian policy . '' \nTo Marina Ottaway , director of the Middle East program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace , the unrest in Egypt showed that the U.S. policy of backing Mubarak despite his poor record on political and human rights has failed to bring desired stability . \nInstead of what she labeled `` subtle '' language such as endorsing an orderly transition , the United States should call for a government of national unity to take over until fully democratic elections for both the presidency and the parliament , Ottaway told CNN on Monday . \nCNN 's John King , Elise Labott and Tom Cohen contributed to this story \n"}
{"id": "18", "time": "2011-02-02", "text": "By Dan Primack February 2 , 2011 : 2:24 PM ET One day before Egyptians took to the streets in protest , a Cairo-based venture capital firm called Sawari Ventures formally launched . \nIt is the nation 's only privately-funded VC firm , with plans to invest between $ 2 and $ 5 million in local technology and telecom startups . \nEarlier today I spoke with Leslie Jump , a Sawari Ventures partner who works out of Washington , D.C. -LRB- her husband is Edward Walker , U.S. Ambassador to Egypt between 1994 and 1997 -RRB- . \nBelow is an edited transcript of our conversation : Fortune : Is it safe to say that business is on hold for Sawari Ventures ? \nLeslie Jump : Definitely . \nThe country is dealing with existential questions right now , and today you have thugs on camels attacking people in the streets . \nSo obviously all regular business has been put on hold . \nOne of our Egyptian partners has a non-Egyptian wife , so he took her to London to keep her safe -- but he plans to return soon . \nOur other partner is out in his neighborhood with a cricket bat , helping to protect it from looters . \nIt was great to see our entrepreneurs come back online today , although they 're all out protesting . \nHow are your firm 's investors reacting ? \nOur lead investor is Naguib Sawiris , the richest man in Egypt . \nHe has been coming out with statements about how we need to get through this period first , and then remember that investment is key to Egypt 's economic development . \nWe completely agree , of course . \nObviously the American investors are a different story , and are a bit more cautious . \nWe knew that a majority of our funding would come from the region , but we wanted some Americans involved to help validate the market . \nYou said that you hope that there is a continued interest in economic development through investment . \nI believe in the pragmatism of the Egyptian people . \nPolitical folks keep asking if Egypt will turn into Turkey or turn into Iran , but I have a very hard time believing the latter is possible . \nThe people are devout , but not fanatical , and the protests have been driven by middle and upper-middle class educated people who understand that economic reform is critical . \nWell , if I had the ear of the minister of finance in the prevailing government , I 'd tell him that the number one issue for entrepreneurs is that the country 's bankruptcy laws must be reformed . \nIt takes two days to start up a company in Egypt and two years to wind it down . \nYou can not have a successful and thriving entrepreneurial ecosystem unless you can fail fast . \nThe second thing is access to capital . \nSpeaking of which , how many other venture capital firms are active in Egypt besides Sawari ? \nBefore January 25 , I used to tell people that the Arab digital economy was a lot like the U.S. digital economy in 1995 . \nIn terms of venture capital , it 's more like 1975 . \nThere are just seven firms in the region : Two in Dubai , two in Egypt -- one is public , and we 're the private one -- one in Jordan , one in the West Bank and Intel Capital . \nEgypt is a market of 80 million people who speak a common language , but it is very under-served in terms of access to capital . \nDespite the political challenges , Egyptians are rampant consumers of consumer technologies and are digital natives because the vast majority is under the age of 30 . \nI 'm hoping that , once things begin to stabilize , we 'll be part of helping to build out an entrepreneurial ecosystem that has incredible potential . \nDan Primack joined Fortune.com in September 2010 to cover deals and dealmakers , from Wall Street to Sand Hill Road . \nPreviously , Dan was an editor-at-large with Thomson Reuters , where he launched both peHUB.com and the peHUB Wire email service . \nIn a past journalistic life , Dan ran a community paper in Roxbury , Massachusetts . \nHe currently lives just outside of Boston . \nMarket indexes are shown in real time , except for the DJIA , which is delayed by two minutes . \nAll times are ET . \nDisclaimer LIBOR Warning : Neither BBA Enterprises Limited , nor the BBA LIBOR Contributor Banks , nor Reuters , can be held liable for any irregularity or inaccuracy of BBA LIBOR . \nMorningstar : 2013 Morningstar , Inc. . \nDisclaimer The Dow Jones IndexesSM are proprietary to and distributed by Dow Jones & Company , Inc. and have been licensed for use . \nAll content of the Dow Jones IndexesSM 2013 is proprietary to Dow Jones & Company , Inc. . \nThe market data is the property of Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. and its licensors . \nFactSet Research Systems Inc. 2013 . \nMost stock quote data provided by BATS . \n"}

'' \nIt s funny how `` reform '' has suddenly become a priority in some of these countries after decades of repressive governments . \nMeanwhile , demonstrators also are calling for change in Algeria and Sudan . \nAnd in Syria , there are protests planned for this week . \nExperts say these protests sweeping across the Middle East and North Africa are `` unprecedented '' and a `` watershed event for the Arab world . '' \nFor now , the leadership in Saudi Arabia and Libya seems secure , but it 's safe to say a new day is dawning . \nHere s my question to you : What 's next for the Middle East ? \nInterested to know which ones made it on air ? \nJack , Do n't worry about what 's next in the Middle East . \nWorry about what 's next in America . \nThe riots in the Middle East are economic-related . \nThey 're driven by high unemployment , economic disaster , and a government that does n't do its job . \nI 'm sure Greece , France and Ireland understand perfectly what 's happening in Egypt . \nWhat 's next for the Middle East is playing catch-up on nearly a thousand years of human rights history , from Britain 's Magna Carta in 1215 until a desperate Tunisian set himself on fire last month . \nIn a let 's - get-it-done-by-breakfast world , already precariously balanced , this is not a task for the faint-hearted . \nI think we can expect to see more people taking to the streets in other Middle Eastern countries seeking change . \nIt 's like a fever that sweeps over an area and everyone catches it . \nWhat is next for us is higher oil prices . \nNick in San Diego writes : If we side with the people for democratic reform in that whole region and tell Israel to get serious concerning the Palestinians or the money stops NOW , we 'll be ok . \nIf not , brace ourselves for more 9-11 's . \nWhat 's next is we finally see if democracy is really all we 've been building it up to be . \nMore of the same . \nThe Middle East has been a hotbed of unrest since God was a little boy . \nIt 's not going to change . \nAnd our interference will only result in more Americans being sent home in pine boxes and a bigger hole in our budget . \nIt 's not our business . \nI doubt seriously that the Egyptians are sitting about asking each other what 's next for Chicago or Des Moines . \nWhatever happens , if it is not to the liking of Israel , the lid to Pandora 's box comes blasting off . \nDriven by the victim mentality , Israel is the one to keep an eye toward . \nWith their overwhelming military power , and paranoid leadership , one wrong move by Israel could lead to the end of the world as we know it . \nThe Rapture , in other words . \nWhatever is in store for the Middle East , the U.S. should let it play out without any interference or threats of action or fleet movements or disparaging remarks about the principle players . \nIt is time the U.S. learned to deal with the world as it is and stop trying to make the world over in its own image . \nHamas , Hezbollah and possibly the Muslim Brotherhood are legitimate political parties in some of those countries . \nIt is hypocritical and counterproductive to call for democratic elections , and then to vilify the parties that were democratically elected and refuse to deal with them because they have a different world view than we do . \nWe have to learn to find common ground and work with these groups . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 5:46 pm | The information age gives the people of Egypt the new world view of freedom . \nThey know the results of the nasty leaders in Iran and I believe they do not want to live that way . \nI have faith in the people of Egypt . \nKen Krieger Cape Coral , Florida February 2 , 2011 at 5:48 pm | What 's next for the Middle East ? \nThe Middle East is surely going through a series of domino effect because of these politicians and false promises . \nOne man will surely come out after the death of King Abdullah . \nHe will be from the descendant of the Prophet Muhammad -LRB- PBUH -RRB- . \nThere is nothing to be frightened of . \nHe loves humanity , he will rule with justice and peace and abide by the rules of the Qur ` an . \nThe genie is out of the bottle . \nIt looks like 2011 is going to be the year of massive upheavals throughout the Middle East and , possible , beyond . \nI would not be surprised if the citizens of Iran return to the streets of Tehran and demand changes in their government . \nNorth Africa , the Middle East , and repressive regimes in the neighborhood are liable to be scenes of riots and demonstrations the likes of which we have never seen and will remember for a long time . \nThe task for the U.S. and other democracies is to support those marching for freedom while not seeming to be pushing events in one direction or another . \nLet them have their revolutions and let us accept the outcomes . \nWe have supported dictators for too long . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 5:51 pm | Glad to see this is happening . \nAt long last people are standing up for themselves instead of beckoning the Western powers to bail them out . \nWestern countries had to fight for thier freedoms -- all of them hoad some sort of uprising 100s of years ago ... from the US to France to Britian and even non-Western Russia . \nNow all we need is an uprising in North Korea somehow and we 're all set . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 5:52 pm | I am sure this is a sign that the Arab world is now going to fall in line with the West and begin to indoctrinate our values into its newly found democratic culture . \nThe world will be a Utopian paradise in no time ... OR -LRB- more likely -RRB- this means that the status quo of the west hate rhetoric is about to intensify with younger , stronger , more militarized & aggressive leaders . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 5:54 pm | If we side with the People for demcratic reform in that whole region and tell Israel to get serious concerning the Palestinians or the $ $ $ stops NOW , we 'll be ok . \nIf not brace ourselves for more 911 's February 2 , 2011 at 5:54 pm | Next up is the emergence of the Muslim Brotherhood taking over all muslim countries , re-establishment of the Chaliphate , and world dominance of Islam . \nIt is afterall the goal of the MB to establish Islam throughout the worlsd , this is the first of it . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 5:55 pm | What does this mean for the rest of the world ? \nWill new regimes spark more anti-western sentiment in the middle east , or will they stabilize this volatile region ?? February 2 , 2011 at 5:56 pm | What if some of these new regimes , elected into office democratically , actually provide for their people , but are more authoritarian and Islam fundamentalist , perhaps anti-U.S.-anti-Israeli . \nBe careful what you wish for . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 5:57 pm | Jack , do n't worry about what 's next in the Middle East . \nWorry about what 's next in America . \nThe riots in the Middle East are economic related . \nDriven by high unemployment , economic disaster , and a government that does n't do it 's job . \nI 'm sure Greece , France and Ireland understand perfectly what 's happening in Egypt . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 5:57 pm | What 's next , you ask ? \nIncreased oil profits for those who last the longest . \nMiddle-Eastern cultures are not breeding grounds for a stable democracy , they are hot-beds of centuries old superstitions , hatreds , igorance and corruption . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 5:59 pm | So what 's new that Revolutions occur with each new generation . \nTimes and needs change according to the new ideas and demands of the populace . \nThe U.S.A. constitution foresaw and provided the Power of Amendments in a peaceful manner . \nAnd , all the more reason to avoid uprisings with the utilization of democratic concepts by and for the people . \nBy now , Kingdoms , Monarchies and Dictators should be History , if not for the Human urge to maintain control and power over others . \nNot wanting to relinquish power , foments Revolution , but the Ego is over powering to those few who think they know what is best for themselves and the Little People . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:02 pm | Dominoes ? \nI will probably be more like a game of potato head - changing parts of the head while the restt of the body stays the same . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:03 pm | It is anyone 's guess what will happen next . \nThe people are speaking , with a very loud voice . \nI think the model to look at is Glasnost with Gorbachev , seems like a similar situation . \nI think Democracy will rise in these countries and there will be economic turmoil for a while before things stabilize . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:05 pm | What 's next ? \nI fear more violence and bloodshed , but I also hope that the people in the Middle East will be able to achieve what most people want - a decent life with dignity and freedom , a life in which they can achieve their full potential . \nSome autocrats make do lip-service to reform , but it will only be to silence their critics until those critics can be totally silenced . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:06 pm | This is an important opportunity for the U.S but from what I 'm seeing we are not taken advantage of it . \nTehran hang three people this week for last year demonstrations . \nThey did it now just in case anyone has any ideas to start the demonstrations again . \nAhmedinejad is an evil s.o.b and we can give him some of his own medicine . \nAll Hillary or Obama have to say is `` people should not put up with oppression and small time dictators '' . \nI guarantee you the Iranian people will get the message . \nSome day they will hang Ahmedinejad and the mullahs from the balconies of Tehran . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:07 pm | The Middle East is heading into a revolutionary phase . \nFirst Morocco and now Egypt which is one of the bigger Middle Eastern prodomently Muslim nations . \nI can see several of the other nations either falling or adjusting to the new trend . \nThe new trend is the Isalmic Brotherhood . \nThe Islamic Brotherhood is a pro-Taliban and promote strict discipline to Allah without question or doubts . \nOnce they are in control , Egypt will be in an even worse off situation . \nOne country that needs to be on heighten awareness is Israel . \nThe Islamic Brotherhood have stated that Israel needs to be destroyed . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:09 pm | Do n't know what to believe here , Jack . \nI hope -- that this is the beginning of the internet being used as a powerful social tool for massive positive change . \nI fear -- that the change could be a fall to decades of ruin unless reasonable governments are built rapidly -- usually its just a power grab , but this seems different . \nI know -- that danger lies in masses of ignorant and uneducated people just expressing their anger -- education is the key to any county 's success . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:10 pm | Once consolidated the Muslim Brotherhood will turn toward Israel and WWlll will begin shortly after . \nI have never seen anything like this . \nThe coming together of the Republican and Democratic elitists to denounce Mubarak after 30 years of propping him up . \nNow both party ` s seem to endorse the Muslim Brotherhood . \nWe , the people of America , have elected the stupidest most self serving congress in all of history . \nThis can not come out good and most probably turn out real bad for us here in the states . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:13 pm | Whats going to happen is a new Muslim World Order will start , or you could say the next Khalifa is on it 's way . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:14 pm | Ethiopia . \nMeles Zenawi is another harsh dictator in Africa and will be next in line to be protested against . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:14 pm | People yern for freedom , even if they 're not sure what to do with it . \nUS foreign policy has been concerned about the latter to it 's detriment . \nOur best chance for good future Egyptian relations is to support change now . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:14 pm | February 2 , 2011 at 6:14 pm | Never mind the Middle East , which could always take care of itself -- without our interference . \nHow about the U.S. , here at home ? \nWe could take a lesson when it comes to corrupt and lying politicians . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:15 pm | Mass exit to the USA looking for work ? \nWho knows Jack but even if they get their wish of new government where will the jobs come from ? \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:15 pm | Tell all the arab leadrers : take a number and wait ... ... you could be next on line . . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:15 pm | Dictators in this world like khamenei and ahmadinejad are next . \nThis revolution is not based in one country but will affect all of the middle east . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:15 pm | A bunch of new dictatorships and\\/or Islamic theocracies . \nArabs have no interest in democracy , except as a way to create a dictatorship or Islamic theocracy . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:16 pm | Jack , I think that is the only ways to remove those dictators from power . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:16 pm | Like you said , after decades and decades of regime , the middle east is finally realizing what `` could be '' with out a form of dictatorship . \nMaybe some time soon you guys in the media will give Bush some credit for what he did in Iraq , when every one in the media and public thought it America was taking over . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:16 pm | The question should be , how will the U.S. manage the new middle east . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:16 pm | I HOPE - Israel signs a Peace Treaty with Palestine and takes the Anti -- American Card Off the Table ?! February 2 , 2011 at 6:16 pm | I wish I could say it was piece and prosperity for all , but sadly enough there just does n't seem to a history of that in this part of the world . \nMiddle East ... Middle Class ... this is the face of corruption and greed infecting communities , countries throughout the world . \nPeace will only come when such distructable forces rule . \nGod have Mercy on us all ... you said there will be days like this . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:16 pm | Whats next ? \nIt 's the perfect setting for radical Muslems to take over . \nPeople will say no way , but think about how radicals had little percentage in Russia , Iran , etc. ... when revolution took place . \nIt just opens the door for them . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:16 pm | People are sick and tired of some jerk thinking he is the supreme leader , they want a say in how the government is ran and just maybe get a little peice of the pie . \nSame thing will happen to the United States some day , the people will get damn sick and tired of the jerks we have in congress and will throw them all out , the only ones they are interested in is themselves and the lobbyist that stuff their pockets with money . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:16 pm | February 2 , 2011 at 6:17 pm | When and under what conditions would UN forces , or the like , take action to help stabilize the situation in Egypt , and the middle east in general ? \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:17 pm | The Mubarack regime of corrupt politicians will be outsted . \nMaybe the people in this country need oust the corrupt politicians in the U.S. Oops that would be all of them ! \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:17 pm | With Israel surrounded by soon to be all anti-semitic countries , it 's safe to say the Middle East is more than likely going to erupt . \nAlso , the US -- no matter if Mubarak somehow regains control or if radical Islamists take over or if democracy ensues -- has just lost their biggest allies in the Middle East . \nWe 'll be lucky if things turn our way ... February 2 , 2011 at 6:17 pm | This is a new age , not only for the Middle East , but for the whole world . \nDespots , dictators , and torturers alike are seeing what can happen when people gather in the name of freedom , democracy and human rights . \nThey have been forewarned , and we can rejoice . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:17 pm | It is my opinion that the Islamists of the middle east , intend to take over the world . \nThey intend to take over all of the countries , and convert them to militant run countries , under the control of Al-Queda , and their allies . \nOnce they have gained control of the middle east , they will move to other countries one by one , and indeed , they have already inserted militant violence into many countries outside of the middle east , including Indonesia , Malaysia , Thailand , and African countries , including Somalia . \nThe Islamic populations of many western countries , are seeing the impact of violence in those countries , already , as well , to include France and Holland , as well as the UK . \nThis is , and has always been , a religious conflict , and it will eventually become world war 3 . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:17 pm | Biggest fear would be the middle east countries would become Theocracies . \nWe would have one big Al Quiada to deal with . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:17 pm | February 2 , 2011 at 6:17 pm | I believe not only the government of Mubarak will collapse , but a new government will arise , and it will be against the will of the people . \nIslam will come to be the ruling power , and Egypt will become one of the many countries to experience this change . \nThis is a terrorist attack , but not in the US , instead , a terrorist attack in the Middle East towards the rest of the World . \nA mastermind plan to continue to unify , a new Empire ... February 2 , 2011 at 6:17 pm | Jack , Tunisia was the beginning , Egypt will not be the end , the people of the middle east have seen that tyrants are vulnerable and can be removed from power , I imagine that next year we will see more much democracy in the middle east Democracy , in my opinion , is a release mechanism for the people in troubling times . \nA way to make a change . \nThe people do n't rebel if they feel they can do something about their situation . \nIt 's only a matter of time before any of these leaderships get forced out . \nIt 's only a matter of time for Iran or even China . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:18 pm | Its seems the fall of Israel looms in the shadow of this `` gas filled room '' we can now call the Middle East ! \nMay God help us all ! \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:18 pm | Jack the Elephant in the room is China . \nHow is the Gov. of China trying to block all this info . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:18 pm | Why does no one mention Iran ? \nFrustrated youth\\/middle class takes to the street . \nRepressive , closed government ; economy a shambles . \nWhat 's Iranian protesters now ? \nUS allied despots have limits on force\\/repression . \nMullas have no such constraint with US military having it 's hands full . \nWhy have I heard nothing about this from the 9 million talking heads discussing the current situation . ? \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:18 pm | I am saddened over the deaths as well as the injured , however we are witnessing history . \nWe , thanks to live coverage by CNN , are eye witness to history in the making . \nLeaders in Arab countries , including Saudi and Libya , had better plan on making changes before changes are made for them . \nLet us all pray for peaceful solutions . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:18 pm | Because we are boxed in wars of attrition in Iraq and Afghanistan , the radical Islamists will take over power in the Middle East and North Africa and will threaten our security and the security of the state of Israel . \nwatch out for Saudi Arabia soon ! \nThe things that are holding up the Saudi royal dissenters are the influence of foreign expatriates on the locals , and the dividends from oil that the saudi government is doling out to every citizen . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | It is unfortunate to see the events unfolding in the middle east and the very sad events destroying years of stability in Egypt . \nI hope the world realizes how grave the current situation is and work hard to bring back stability in the region ; otherwise , we could be heading towards third world war February 2 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | If Mubarak leaves before September , I strongly believe that other oppressed nations , not just Arab nations , be inspired to speak out and will demand change in their governments . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | February 2 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | February 2 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | I would hope the people of the Mideast could enjoy the peace of what is considered normal day-to-day life that we take for granted here in the US . \nMaybe that s too much to ask since our complacency hasn t really brought us that normalcy of late . \nBut maybe , someday , for all of us . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | i hope that Libya would be next . \nLibya actually has one of the worst oppressive regimen in the region . \nactually we Libyan used to look to Tunisia and Egypt as a heaven comparing to our Gaddafi oppression , I think the problem is Libya has not usually had a fair share of media coverage as the other countries in the region . \nGaddafi regimen has being nothing but a mix of oppression and brutality for 42 years . \ncan you believe that 42 years !! if we think for a minute how many president did USA have since then ? \nthis brutal dictatorship has been in power since the days of president kennedy in USA !! does that sound too long time ?? What 's next for Middle East ? \nThe middle east ... safe and prosperous ... hard working people ... parents raising kids ... good education , good health care and justice for all ... but more importantly , going to sleep every night knowing your government is working for you instead of you slaving for it ... February 2 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | Nothing will change no matter who is in charge . \nThe Middle East is mostly desert . \nThe people are complaining food is too expensive and jobs are too few . \nCNN shows pictures of mother 's feeding babies opium because there 's no food . \nIn Africa people kill anything that lives within miles of their villages for `` bush meat . '' \nYet they keep having babies by the dozens -LRB- literally -RRB- . \nJust how many jobs are there for billions of people ? \nHow much food grows in the desert ? \nIs anyone talking about this ? \nDid anyone notice the horses the Mobarak supporters rode in on ? \nThe only thing that will save us now is a massive human die-off . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | If the rest of the world is lucky , the american government will stop supplying everyone with weapons ... oh I forgot , war is business and everyone has the right to bear arms !!!!!! We supported the Dictator Hosni Mubarack for thirty years because he signed peace agreements with Israel , but we overthrew the Dictator Saddam Hussein because he threatened Israel . \nWhere is our equality ? \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | Change is coming . \nThe real question is `` can the unorganized democracy movement catch up to the organized fundamentalist movement in time to take advantage of this opportunity '' . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | Next is Sudan . \nRemember Sudan people led two uprising in the last 49 years and ignited to close a half century with a third one . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | Jack , Maybe we will finally find the weapons of mass distruction hidden by Saddam and give new life to secular discord in Iraq . . \nOr maybe there will B a Lesson Learned -LRB- too late -RRB- to our own American Youth . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | As a Lebanese American I tell you that we are unfortunately losing credibility with the new generations in the Middle East . \nWe seem to be supporting Dictators , Kings etc. . . \nWe need to support the Democracy that the people are fighting for . \nAnd relying on the USA to support and help . \nWe can not afford top be on the fence . \nMcdonalds on every corner , shopping plaza 's every 200 feet , major corporate profit margins and citizens loosing their homes , starving on the streets without health insurance while their politicians make appearances on the latest hot nightly talk show 's . \nJust like our great country ! \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:21 pm | February 2 , 2011 at 6:21 pm | I have always beleived that a dictatorship is very important to pave the way for democracy in the middle east . \nbut who is the honest dictator that is welling to speed up process and be the the first victim of it ! \nInternet will speed the process . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:21 pm | Jack , I really hope that a new day has began for the middle east . \nIt was about time that people there have freedom of speech . \nI am sure they can find a way to stay true to their habits , culture and religion without being radical and starting to related better with the rest of the world . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:22 pm | Jack , if the past is prologue , then we only have to look back at how the world was reformed in the early 1900s . \nGovernments fell , autocratic families lost their reputations and power and all of Europe was reshaped as World War One raged and reformed countries and alliances . \nPerhaps World War Three will occur in the Middle East -- not between the US and the USSR as we once expected -- and these events will be a historical tipping point affecting the world for the rest of the century . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:22 pm | Shades of Tianaman Square . \nIMubarak was just marking time with his speech while his goons organized to disrup the crowd . \nI predict the crowd demostrating for democracy will be put down eventually by the military and Mubarak install martial law and keep power . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:22 pm | The Middle East is a powderkeg . \nThere has been so much tyranny and violence throughout this area since the dawn of civilization that few in the Middle East will either forgive or forget the past . \nToo bad , because they will end up disrupting many countries outside of the Middle East . \nWhats next ... thats easy ... the people of the middle east have had a look around and see themselves being left behind in the 20th century , or in th case of the middle east , the 19th century should they not get moving forward fast ... next is American and other business from around the world opening business there to grow the economy and get peoplw working ... if you area a bad political member be aware the internet is about to uncover your poor efforts ... February 2 , 2011 at 6:23 pm | Mobarak removed ? \nNo risk for the Egyptians and Democracy , for the US and Israel we 'll lose a supporter and follower . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:23 pm | Duop Chak , Colorado Springs , Colorado Jack , No doubt , the greater Middle East is heading to a rock solid . \nI don t think I can live in a country ruled by a King or something on that line because they like to impose their desires on ordinary citizens without consulting them . \nDictators , Kings , queens or those who call themselves royal family should think again . \nIt is getting uglier by seconds February 2 , 2011 at 6:23 pm | What 's next for the Middle East ? \nThey 'll be issuing America an apology for all of the whining they did when we liberated Iraq and Afghanistan . \nJack , now they 'll see the chaos that ensues when America 's helping hand is n't there . \nThese failing countries are going to lead to a situation where the Middle East is entirely `` for sale '' to Al Qaeda , almost like office space . \nIf America had done what it was supposed to do ten years ago , we would not only have liberated Iraq , but the entire Middle East . \nThese type of situations would never be allowed to happen if U.S. military bases were around . \nwhat 's next is going to be better for the US and the people of the middle east . \nThe arab world have been in solation for decades because of there dictatorial regimes and injustice . \nAnd , the problem they did n't do anything to there young people who needs to work and live like all human beings all over the world . \nCorrupted governments who they keep inflaming there people with speeches and hate towards the West and egnoring there injustice rule . \nSo , I think Next will be Democracy for the Arab world and good relations with there neighbors and the world . \nCooperation Which is needed in this century for all over the world . \nThese people are asking for simple things like living in dignity and respect and be able to find jobs and being treated like human beings from there governemnt , and we should support those people February 2 , 2011 at 6:23 pm | It seems like the Arab nations are committing a Holocaust upon themselves . \nFor them , some groups hate other groups of themselves . \nSome totally fear others . \nThey all hate Israel and Jews . \nIsrael must sit back not knowing whether all the Arab nations will eventually blame Israel for the Holocaust the Arab nations are committing upon themselves . \nIt 's too impossible for The White House to figure out . \nMubarak must be sitting back and laughing at them all . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:23 pm | February 2 , 2011 at 6:24 pm | This barbarian is unleashing his pigs to massacre the egyptian youth the world has to stop him or this is gonna be God only knows what for everybody . \nAn Egyptian American crying for immediate actions you February 2 , 2011 at 6:24 pm | What a question , just a continuation what has been going on already . \nThe place is a powder keg just waiting for a match . \nEventually it is all going to burn . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:25 pm | It is time for this country and this administration to stand for what is right and for what America is all about and unequivocally be with the people of Egypt . \nWhat the Egyptians want is their Freedom from a tyrant and a dictator who oppressed them for 30 years -LRB- unfortunately with American aid and tax payer 's money -RRB- . \nNext `` God Willing '' Jack is Algeria , Jordan , Yemen , Syria , Saudi Arabia ... etc. . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:25 pm | February 2 , 2011 at 6:25 pm | I hate Mubarak , and I want him to leave ! \nBUT let 's be HONEST , the reason he has been in power for 30years is partly our responsibility . \nOur generation let him , we did not have a revolution when he got re-elected the first time , the second time , the third time ... , ` God does not change what is upon a people until they change themselves ' ! \nThis generation has made us all wake up . \nThe bigger test to the success of this revolution is the next steps , the next elections , our reaction the next time someone is abused , the next time someone steals , the next time someone corrupts , that is the real test . \nCorruption in Egypt is more intrinsic then just in the government and just Mubarak -- the real revolution is an awakening of a country to uphold the values we Egyptians had forgotten , and when what is right is very distinct from what is wrong all the time !! Not just during the ten days of a revolution ! \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:26 pm | Wow , the whole world is in melt down mode , and people say the Bible is a hoax . \nHa , the Lord on high laughs , This is happening beacuse men reap what they sow . \nIts not just happening here , thers stuff goin on all over the place , dont beleive me just watch the news . \nWe havent seen anything yet . \nThese are the last days that Jesus spoke of in Matthew chpt .24 , read it . \nWant to escape whats coming upon the earth than repent of your sins and beleive in the Lord Jesus Christ and u will be saved . \nJesus said that the world would be as it was in the days of Noah before his return February 2 , 2011 at 6:26 pm | Let 's see these dictators fall !! At least this time the U.S. does n't have to get involved to make democracy happen ! \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:26 pm | Next is Sudan . \nRemember Sudan people led two uprising in the last 49 years and are ignited to close a half century with a third one . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:27 pm | I truly think this is the beginning or the end ... the protester 's have already said they are ANTI American and Israeli and it they WIN and Mubarak just leaves the people who will go into power will turn Egypt into a BIGGER and more dangerous Iran . \nI fear for all the Middle East . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:27 pm | What 's happening is a prelude to an Islamic super-state that will control OPEC for years to come . \nGet ready for seriously high energy costs . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:27 pm | The genie is out , but the chaos will eventually result in extreme violence . \nEgyptians and Arabs will need to steel themselves and prepare to counter the nefarious individuals who will use violence to seize power . \nAl Jazeera will play an crucial role , and I am not optimistic that the news organization is up to the challenge . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:28 pm | I do believe Washington D.C. best take note . \nPeople all over the globe are feeling their governments are not taking notice to their every day plight to servive and care for their famlies . \nI hope Washington recognizes that many in this country have similar concerns . \nOur leaders would be wise to understand this and stop these decades of non cooperation between parties . \nThis country was founded upon civil unrest , it could happen again . \nFirst and formost , elected officials work for the American people , , , not some lobby , religious group , EXXON , WALLMART , or other big business . \nYou in Washington ... get with it ... do not drive our country to the civil unrest that is happening in the Mid East . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:29 pm | Just think about a tsunami sweeping across the Middle East that eventually sweeps to the shores of Israel . \nThat 's what 's next , Jack . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:29 pm | Please help the Egyptian people get the ARMY back to Tahrir Square !! Civil war is what is next and the demise of a very crucial Nation is at stake ! \nPlease HELP !! February 2 , 2011 at 6:29 pm | Next is world leaders to stop supporting dictators , monarchy regimes in middle east and start the walk the walk of big talks of democracy , freedom and human rights . \nSome democratic governments will come out as we expect and some wo n't but that should n't let us support a dictator again . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:29 pm | Whatever is next for the Middle East , I hope it does n't further involve US forces . \nAs provocative as the past couple of weeks have been , the issues these citizens have been protesting against are the issues of their nation , and in all honesty , need to be addressed by the powers to be within their nation . \nMy fear is that OUR nation somehow sees this as a problem WE need to fix . \nHopefully , that will not be the case . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:30 pm | The best we can do is stay out of the people 's way . \nWhatever governments are formed in the wake of this are going to need aid and when they come knocking on the rest of the world 's door for it -LRB- certainly oil-rich Arab countries like Saudi Arabia wo n't help them - they never give to crisis funds -RRB- , we should negotiate a peace agreement that gives them autonomy over their lands , natural resources and governments but puts pressure on accepting Israel . \nIf they wo n't support that -- no aid . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:30 pm | Remember back in the cold war when the Soviet Union was so concerned with western ` propaganda ' contaminating their population ? \nBut they could n't stop the advancement of 20th century communications . \nIt was inevitable that people living behind the Iron Curtain would learn what life was like outside . \nNow , thanks to 21st century communications via the web , something similar is happening in the middle east . \nA lot of what happens may be dependent on what they believe the rest of us have , which they have been denied . \nof the world feel the need to be cautious of what they say publicly maybe the rest of us need to signal our support and encourage the Egyptians to choose a secular democracy that will last instead of just another oppressive theocratic regime . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:30 pm | Any conjecture from anyone is simply a guess at this point , Jack . \nWhat would be truly ironic , however , would be if Bush 's prophecy and hope for democratic states in the Middle East , came to pass . \nAccording to our highly esteemed Vice President , Mr. Biden , Egypt is already in that column . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:30 pm | This is history being made right in front of our eyes . \nThis is control by fear and the toxicity of shame being cast aside for democracy and freedom . \nThis is absolute ideology that cripples everyone , even us , being shunned and replaced with truth and imagination by the youth in these countries . \nWhether the path to God is through Jesus , Abraham , Buddha , or Mohammad , the goal of all of us to come together at the feet of this one God we all seek no matter the path we take . \nAnd the young sisters and brothers of the Middle East are beginning on this path of unity and freedom . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:31 pm | In the 21st Century , it becomes difficult to suppress and repress human beings . \nTo say that we did not see this coming is foolish . \nTechnology plays a very important role in people 's realization that they do not have to live the way the upper crust forces them to live . \nAn awakening of this sort should not be discarded in the U.S. among the ethnic groups here . \nHopefully I 'm wrong ! \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:31 pm | What is most concerning in the face of the sudden activity in the middle east is the fact that Pres Obama has demonstrated over and over again his absolute inability , or total intent not , to confront , criticise , restrict or take a stand against anything muslim . \nThe only thing that is a predictable and clear outcome from what is going on is that The President needed to take a stand , and as usual , did not , and will notdo so in the future . \nHis inability to stand up for democracy and american values , even in the face of muslims clearly independently demanding it , demostrates the total ineffectiveness of his perceived politically correct policy of non interfearance in muslim foreign affairs . \nIt is totally pathetic that he does n't encourage their desire for freedom , and he does n't use the opportunity to warn against the Muslim Brotherhood who present such a threat to the future of their freedom . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:31 pm | Please stop comparing Jordan to Tunisia and Egypt , Jordan has been a haven for refugees for decades , Iraqis , Palestinians , Armenians and Circassians -LRB- who were driven out by the Russians from the Caucausus . -RRB- \nJordan is a modern and peaceful country , we have been affected by the rising food and oil prices like the rest of the world , it 's true that jobs are scarce due to the increase in the number of the population , but no one can call our King Abdullah a dictator . \nThere have been calls for the dismissal of Samir Rifaai 's government for months and months , way before what had happened in Tunisia and Egypt , our country is in no way `` in danger '' nor are we `` nervous '' or part of this domino scheme you speak of . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:32 pm | It certainly seems that middle east might change dramatically in near future as a result of current developments . \nI hope that these changes wo n't bring militant religious groups to power but will instead introduce new and strong pillars of democracy , individual freedom and stability to the world . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:32 pm | What 's next is that corrupt politicians , military strongmen and anyone else capable of seizing control will double-think their own fate before designating themselves perpetual heads of state . \nAnd not just in the Middle East , but everywhere . \nThe Egypt situation clearly shows the enormous power the general public has when it is able to organize and plan collectively . \nSure , when the voices of the majority are faint and distant , the Musharrafs and al-Gadaffis of the world can plant themselves at the top and use economies as personal fortunes . \nBut when the population integrates its anger , the guillotine is next . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:33 pm | Jack , I am not sure what 's next but it seems that Egypt will destroy over thousands of years of history with the fires . \nItems that can never be replaced . \nMummies that are their ancestors . \nI understand there pleas but why destroy what is their history in the process . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:33 pm | To predict the future in the middle east has always been predictable . \nRigged elections , payoffs to rivals and compliance by so called anti factions i.e. US and others same O same O. February 2 , 2011 at 6:34 pm | Do you mean whats next after the middle east ? \nWell lets try south east Asia -LRB- Bangladesh , and the likes , perhaps countries near Europe : Morocco , Turkey -RRB- Surprisingly Libya will remain relatively stable . \nAmerica might want to review it 's exit strategy for the region . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:34 pm | It is a question that no one can answer conclusively but will take time . \nIf reform equals democracy ; Middle Eastern democracy will not look like American democracy . \nWe in the west need to be open to facilitate the discussions with these countries for them to define what democracy is to them and not place our form of government and governing on them . \nWe need to respect their culture -LRB- s -RRB- . \nHow they do it and what it will look like will be different from how western governments govern but that is not to say that democracy in the Middle East will not work . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:35 pm | The people of the Middle East and Africa have come to realize that , people 's power is the Key . \nThis revolution wo n't be isolated only to the Middle East , I 'm convinced it will spread down to the Southern part of Africa harboring many dictators well over 80 , and wish to continue rulling . \nI think it 's time for people to excercise their power peacefully and kick out people like Mugabe of Zimbabwe , Paul Biya of Cameroon etc , who think dictatorship and bad governace is the way forward . \nIt 's time to bring in modern and 21 st century leaders . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:35 pm | Freedom is next . \nDo n't know what it will look like in the Middle East but the masses are ravienous for human rights . \nNo hitting the snooze now -- watch out -- it 's going to be huge and they , the people will demand to be satiated ! \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:36 pm | I guess we 'll have to find another dictatror to send our prisoners for torture February 2 , 2011 at 6:36 pm | Are you kidding me Jack ? \nWhat 's next for the Muslims in the Middle East is currently being played out on the big screen . \nWhat 's next for the U.S. and the Western world depends on our ability to support the democratic ideals that we inspired in the first place . \nThe U.S. must vacate the cowardice idea of supporting Mubarak in the presence of an uncertain outcome . \nThis is our great opportunity to defy history and help forge a new path for the Middle East and a new future for our World . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:36 pm | More instability without a doubt . \nI admire these people as they have the guts to step outside the box . \nThey can see a threat to their freedoms and take complete charge of restoring them or broadening them , even if it means blood shed . \nAmericans , the majority , think this reaction to their government is barbaric . \nI tend to think it is heroic . \nThese countries have many visible patriots . \nThey truly care about their future and their childrens . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:38 pm | It will devolve into an Islamic , fundementalist , theocratic region . \nEgypt will partner with Iran and put pressure on the 2 remaining western-friendly states , Israel and Saudi Arabia . \nDemocracy in this region of the world means mob rule . \nWithout a foundation built on indiividual freedom , freedom of religion , separation of church and state , and equality for all citizens , democracy is no better than a dicatator . \nWithout a nation of laws , protecting it 's people from the government and placing the rights of individuals above the moral dictates of the ruler , the majority will suppress the minorities , in this case , in the name of religious rights . \nPeople do n't seem to understand that Democracy is just a civilized way to transfer power and speaks nothing as to the nature of the power that will be wielded by the winners of elections . \nIn this case the majority view women as inferior and have no tolerance of religions outside Islam . \nIndeed , good times are ahead of us . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:39 pm | One of two things will happen in the Middle East . \nThey will get a real democracy and hate the US or they will get a fundamentalist government , hate the US and do something about it . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:39 pm | I 'm afraid I 'm not entirely sure who I should be rooting for -- or against -- in this one . \nAs an American , I am genetically engineered to despise dictatorships : but as a weary citizen of the world , I am also wary of destabilization in highly sensitive areas . \nI see no Ghandis in this uprising : if I did , I think I 'd feel a bit more optimistic about the immediate future of the Middle East . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:40 pm | Jack I just spoke with family in Cairo ... The Egyptian government are recruiting all government employees thru different ministries to organize a pro Mubarak protest tomorrow and Friday to show more support from ordinary people instead of rent a mob protesters . \nEmployees who decide not to join the government will be accused of threatening the national security . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:40 pm | February 2 , 2011 at 6:41 pm | Change must come , but violence can be tamped down by real choices and leadership . \n$ 2 a day earners are internet smart and know it is all about money and power . \nChange the instruments and policies . \nAn oil energy dependent world is a tinderbox . \nOil burns , just like a Molotov cocktail . \nEven Nigeria and Venezuela are part of the global picture . \nThis is a global phenomenon , not only the Mid-East . \nPakistan also understands food and fuel inflation . \nThe wave effect is not just in sports stadia . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:41 pm | Away overdue democratic tsunami overtaking Islamic nations . \nWhether we end up with regimes such as that of Turkey or Iran depends on how fast western democracies line up with the side of the masses . \nThe vacillation of the Obama administration and other western democracies in dealing with Mubarak will prove to be destructive to western interests for decades to come . \nWhat 's next is that corrupt politicians , military strongmen and anyone else capable of seizing control will double-think their own fate before designating themselves perpetual heads of state . \nAnd not just in the Middle East , but everywhere . \nThe Egypt situation clearly shows the enormous power the general public has when it is able to organize and plan collectively . \nSure , when the voices of the majority are faint and distant , the Musharrafs and al-Gadaffis of the world can plant themselves at the top and use economies as personal fortunes . \nBut when the population integrates its anger , the guillotine is inevitable . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:43 pm | Only God knows what is next . \nWho 'd have expected that a frustrated guy in Tunisia could 've sparked all of this . \nThe pressure has been on for a very long time , and too much pressure causes explosion . \nThere are important points that we all should learn from this . \nMost importantly , in my own opinion is to support the new generation . \nThose who are protesting peacefuly . \nWe need to show that the protesting peacefuly is the right thing to do , and that resorting to violence is not the answer . \nWe are witnesses the generation of Face Book and Twitter facing off with the generation of horses and camels . \nIf we do the right thing , I can see a different , more peaceful Middle East . \nInformation Technology did not only allow people in the Middle East to express their views , but more importantly , allowed them to see democracy at work in America and Europe , and they deserve no less . \nThis is good for everybody including Israel . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:44 pm | Middle East should form a METO just like NATO . \nStop fighting each other . \nStand side by side and fight everyone who bring war upon METO . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:44 pm | America 's Leadership makes decisions by watching the polls and seeing which way the wind is blowing ... because they refuse to stand on absolute values . \nThus they appear wishy washy and make poor decisions and lose credibility with the rest of the world . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:45 pm | These governments have been leaders in repression for centuries . \nFear eventually leads to repression and ignorance . \nThose who push this fear and supression eventually receive their reward -- revolution . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:45 pm | What eds to happen . \nThere needs to be an election held and the winners in each nation should be elevated to the position . \nOnce the American people have spoken the rest of the world needs to sit back and let us take over . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:47 pm | This is like a 21st century enlightenment . \nThe domino effect has been so powerful that it is impossible to tell where it will stop . \nAll those who are in power today in that part of the world thought they could oppress the people , exert as much pressure as they wanted to ; silence the educated and knowledgeable ; limit freedom of speech ... the public apparently had been getting ready and they needed something to pull the trigger . \nThat was pulled in Tunisia and the ripples are speading around in all directions . \nwhere would it end ? \nat the Black Sea ? \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:48 pm | We should revert to verbal neutrality with regards to the transition in Egypt and in the Region . \nThe North Africans know what they want and the timetables for change and governmental restructuring . \nWe ca n't possibly know what all the people want and what is best for them . \nOur suggestions will only alienate us with one segment of the population or another . \nIt 's not our civil war . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:49 pm | What 's next is the following : \\* The insurrection now occuring in Egypt will ensue in Morocco , Sudan , Saudi Arabia and Kurwait as well as Libyia and Chad . \n\\* Mubarak will either step down as ASAP or be summarily removed . \n\\* There will be some economic disruption to the economies of the Arab world which will impact the rest of the world \\* Progressive political and more importantly , economic changes will occur in the Arab world . \nThe rest of the world may well benefit from these changes . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:50 pm | Next is what will be the first time EVER an Arab country wil Actually ELECT a president and not just accept someone shoved down their throat . \nThe young-in-Hair regimes have reached what they have been trying to evade all along hiding behind boogy-men such as the Muslim Brotherhood to scare off any attempts of calls to Democracy . \nAlleging that THEIR presence is important to fend off any rise of such groups to power . \nHosni game has been dealt the final hand . \nHe has been making the wrong choices all along but has been lucky . \nWell , time caught up with him and the band of bandits that stole everything from their people . \nGhaddafy , is next . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:51 pm | as a student living in beirut i have to say that the only way for us to develop is for these totalitarian regimes to dissappear . \nwe need to catch uo to the world and thats not gna happen without freedom and democracy . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:52 pm | Jack Cafferty sounds off hourly on the Situation Room on the stories crossing his radar . \nNow , you can check in with Jack online to see what he 's thinking and weigh in with your own comments online and on TV . \nWould you ride in a car that drives itself ?

'' \nSaleh has been in office for 32 years and was last re-elected in 2006 . \nHigh-ranking officials around him have started obtaining ordinary passports for themselves and their families -- in addition to the official diplomatic ones they already carry -- as the unrest spreads , Arab diplomatic sources in the capital of Sanaa told CNN . \n`` There is a lot of trepidation here and no one wants to be in the situation that Ben Ali found himself in after he was forced flee , '' one source said , declining to be named because of the sensitivity of the situation . \nThe Tunisian government recently canceled the official passports of deposed leader Zine El Abedine Ben Ali and his family . \nIn recent weeks , thousands of people have taken to the streets in Yemen demanding the kind of change that forced Ben Ali from office last month . \nSome of the protesters have called for Saleh to step down as president . \nEarlier this year , Yemen 's parliament began debating proposed amendments to the country 's constitution . \nThe measures , which would cancel presidential term limits , have sparked concerns among the opposition that Saleh might try to appoint himself president for life . \nOn Wednesday , Saleh said he has requested his party to freeze debate on the proposed amendments until a consensus is reached . \nThe opposition coalition , Joint Meeting Parties -LRB- JMP -RRB- , said the president 's speech was not enough and called on its followers to continue with Thursday 's planned march , said Hakim Almasmari , editor in chief of the Yemen Post . \nA day earlier , the president also ordered the release of journalist Abdul Elah Haidar Shaye who was sentenced to five years in jail last month after he was convicted of collaborating with al Qaeda in Yemen , according to the country 's official news agency , SABA . \n"}

'' \n`` There are usually a line of thugs outside a protest who are waiting there , '' he said . \n`` They 're dressed in plain clothes , and then they 'll usually go and attack the protesters . \nEgyptians have seen this for quite some time , and that 's why they were able to recognize what was going on fairly quickly .

{"id": "99", "time": "2011-02-02", "text": "New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak 's announcement Tuesday that he will turn over power to an elected successor in September does n't go nearly far enough , says analyst Fareed Zakaria . \n`` Mubarak is going to have to go , '' Zakaria said in an interview , adding that he will not be able to stay in office for eight more months . \n`` But the manner in which he goes and the nature of the transition is going to be very important . \nSo I hope the United States is using what influence it has to try to make sure that there 's a transition that makes sense and does n't lead to chaos or allowing any one group to capture the political process . '' \nMubarak 's announcement that he would end his 30 years of rule in September came after massive protests in Egypt for the past eight days . \nBut many protesters proclaimed they were unsatisfied with his statement and called for him to leave office immediately . \nThe author and host of CNN 's `` Fareed Zakaria GPS '' spoke to CNN on Thursday . \nHere is an edited transcript : CNN : What do you think of the way the administration is handling the crisis in Egypt ? \nFareed Zakaria : I think the administration is getting the balance right now , if reports are correct that President Obama has delivered a message to Mubarak that urges him to announce that he will not seek the presidency again . \nBut privately U.S. officials should be further urging that he announce a transition plan immediately . \nHe wo n't be able to stick around till September . \nCNN : So what should happen next ? \nZakaria : The best course would be for Mubarak to get ahead of these events and announce a process by which it is clear that he is not going to be president . \nI think there is a technical problem that most people have not focused on . \nUnder the Egyptian constitution , if Mubarak resigns , it immediately triggers a new election within 60 days . \nAnd in the midst of everything that is going on in Egypt , that is not the ideal solution . \nSo perhaps what he should do is announce that he 's going to resign at a certain point -- but in the interim create a constitutional committee that can amend or rewrite the Egyptian constitution so that all elections , parliamentary or presidential , take place under new rules which will be free and fair , unlike the old rules that were completely stacked in favor of Mubarak and his party . \nCNN : What 's the potential path to democracy in Egypt ? \nZakaria : I think there will have to be a much greater role for public participation , elections and democracy . \nThe more difficult part is : Will there be a transition to constitutionalism , the rule of law and the protection of human rights ? \nThat 's always been the tricky part in these kinds of circumstances . \nYou want to make sure that you have protections for minorities , protections for individual rights , independent courts , freedom of press , freedom of association and all those things tend to be the real inner stuffing of democracy . \nThat 's why I think having some kind of process and a constitutional order become very important . \nYou know , these sound like technicalities , but at the moment of transition how you deal with these questions has a huge impact on the kind of eventual political system you end up with . \nCNN : Why is that so crucial ? \nZakaria : If you look at Iraq , it was the decisions made in the first month -LRB- after Saddam Hussein 's rule ended -RRB- that ended up creating the climate for what became a civil war . \nWe should try as much as we can to help the Egyptians understand that what they want is a transition that ends up producing stable liberal democracy . \nObama on Egypt : Change must happen now Cleric : ` Islamic uprising ' in Egypt The other key is the role of the army . \nPeople have n't completely recognized that Egypt is really a military dictatorship , with a civilian at the top . \nThe army is not going to quietly allow for a democratic order that completely takes away all its powers and privilege , so the army will want to have a very strong role in the process , and that is probably inevitable -- and maybe where the United States has much of its influence because we have maintained pretty good contacts with the army . \nCNN : Is a strong role for the army compatible with a more democratic Egypt ? \nZakaria : It 's compatible as long as the army understands it ca n't be the old system . \nIn Turkey the army effectively ran the country and began to yield power . \nIt 's happened in other countries as well . \nBut unless there 's a real process put in place you could easily end up with a pseudo democracy like Pakistan where civilians are elected , but the military wields the real power . \nCNN : What are the implications of this for the wider Arab world ? \nZakaria : The implications of this will be substantial because Egypt is the heart and soul of the Arab world . \nThe two biggest political movements in the Arab world in the past 50 years have been pan-Arabism or Arab nationalism and Islamic fundamentalism , both of them were centered in Egypt -- pan-Arabism with Nasser and Islamic fundamentalism with the Muslim Brotherhood and also al Qaeda , which was largely a marriage of Egyptian brains and Saudi Arabian money . \nYou can already see the implications in Jordan . \nI do n't think it means there will be a domino effect and you will see regimes all over the Mideast toppling . \nBut I think you will certainly see a greater demand for accountability and reform , and without any question it will rattle regimes like Syria , and Libya . \nWhether or not they fall will be a case by case situation . \nMost of these regimes are very tough police states , so it is not really that easy to protest or do things that would undermine the regime . \nBut I think we 're entering a new era in the Middle East , and I think it 's impossible that things will remain the same in any of those countries . \nCNN : Was America blindsided by these events ? \nZakaria : I do n't think that 's true . \nThe Americans for 15 years now have been urging the Mubarak regime to engage in serious political reforms . \nThe reality is that people sometimes exaggerate American influence . \nAnd there was in Washington a concern that you did need Egypt to maintain a peaceful border with Israel , to enforce the embargo on Hamas , to fight al Qaeda and other terrorist groups . \nNow perhaps this led to us not pushing political reform strongly enough . \nBut since the presidency of Bush senior , Washington has been pushing these issues . \nThe truth is that the Mubarak regime was a very tough unyielding regime that had decided that it was not going to do any political reform . \nI think that in the face of that , it was difficult to see how we could have had a huge impact . \nBut the broader point I 'd make is that the reason this is happening in Egypt is that they are aware of the wider world , they are aware that the United States was pushing for reform . \nThey see openness in other parts of the world . \nThis is partly a desire of Egypt to catch up with the rest of the world and become like other modern countries . \nWatch Fareed Zakaria GPS Sundays at 10am and 1pm ET . \nFor the latest from Fareed Zakaria GPS click here . \n"}

Nazif Shahrani : Arabs demanding `` liberation from being treated as slaves and subjects '' Isobel Coleman : If reforms come , `` expect Islam to play a larger role in government '' Blake Hounshell : Popular comedy `` Terrorism and Kebab '' revealed , predicted this unrest -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Bowing to the massive pressure of demonstrators , Egypt 's President Hosni Mubarak said Tuesday he will step down in September after 30 years in power . \nKing Abdullah II dismissed his government in Jordan as calls for reform swept across North Africa and the Middle East . \nAnalysts offer their views on what this wave of unrest means for the region and the world . \nThe Arab upheaval , which has been compared to the 1989 collapse of the Berlin Wall , challenges not only the regimes that are falling , but also more fundamentally the entire Arab order that has held since the decolonization of three generations ago . \nWe are witnessing the triumph of people power over the inertia of political power . \nOverpopulation and corruption are the twin scourges of almost all post-colonial countries across Africa , the Middle East , and South Asia . \nTunisia , Egypt , Jordan -- and other Arab societies like Morocco , Libya , Yemen , and Syria -- are all pressed to manage global economic forces and channel them into benefits such as jobs and welfare for their citizens . \nEven the monarchies like Jordan and Morocco wo n't be considered legitimate unless they deliver the goods . \nA new governance model will emerge from the wreckage of these regimes . \nPresidential or executive powers will be curtailed . \nStrongman states will diminish . \nCronyism and clan-based governance will be replaced by more technocratic leadership that will answer to the people as well as to global markets . \nThe old Arabism of anti-colonial rhetoric and failed Sunni unity will be replaced by a new Arabism led by Qatar 's Al Jazeera , Lebanese bloggers , and Dubai-best investors . \nIt is their entrepreneurship , know-how , and capital which are re-shaping the vast young Arab generation 's outlook on the world . \nThis is the kind of fresh , young secular Arabism the West should get behind -- liberating them from the squeeze between autocrats and would-be theocrats . \nA domino effect does n't have to be a bad thing . \nReplacing autocracy with democracy and ideology with pragmatism would be a big step forward for much of the Arab world . \nWe should welcome this ushering in of a new era . \nIbrahim Sharqieh , deputy director of Brookings Doha Center and Fellow , Saban Center for Middle East Policy : Day of violence in Egypt Today , all Arabs are asking the same question : after Tunisia and Egypt , who is next ? \nThere are , however , many differences between these two countries as well as between them and the rest of the Arab world . \nIn each country , there are certain characteristics that may make replicating the uprising less likely . \nUnlike Tunisia and Egypt , Jordan is a kingdom ; Syria is a security controlled state , Yemen is a tribal society , and Sudan is ethnically divided . \nDespite all these structural differences , there is one thing that unites them all . \nIt is the power of successful revolt that inspires all of them to consider launching their own uprisings . \nThis power is stimulating the emergence of a `` can do '' attitude in the Arab world , which is breaking the barrier of fear that has long suppressed popular expression . \nEvery Arab citizen is now reflecting upon the successes of Egypt and Tunisia and considering their shortfalls . \nThe leaders , too , are learning from the successes of Tunisia and Egypt . \nThe strong lesson they have learned is that once people take to the streets , returning to the status quo becomes highly unlikely . \nArab autocrats should learn the lesson : Preemptive and serious political reform is the only real means for survival . \nShadi Hamid , director of research at the Brookings Doha Center and a fellow at the Saban Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution : Facing mounting protests , King Abdullah of Jordan sacked his government and appointed a new prime minister . \nObservers should not treat this as a breakthrough , as some already are . \nCabinet reshuffles are business as usual for Jordan , which goes through governments at a fairly rapid clip . \nIn any case , the person of the prime minister does not matter as much as people think . \nThe one with the final decision-making authority is the king . \nTo the extent that Jordan is faltering , both economically and politically , the responsibility lies not with the prime minister but with the monarch . \nIn Egypt and Tunisia , we saw a similar regime strategy : half-measures rather than fundamental reforms that address protesters ' grievances . \nIt did n't work there and is likely to fall flat in Jordan as well . \nMore problematically , the new prime minister is a man named Marouf al-Bakhit , a former army general . \nAnd the fact that King Abdullah chose to appoint him sends worrying signals . \nBakhit is a military man who , if anything , is known for an aversion to democratic reform . \nDuring his previous stint as prime minister from 2005-7 , he launched a crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood , the major opposition group in the country . \nAnd in November 2007 , he oversaw one of the most fraudulent elections in Jordan 's history . \nIn other words , Jordan is still stuck . \nIsobel Coleman , author of '' Paradise Beneath Her Feet '' and a senior fellow for U.S. foreign policy at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York : The specter of Islamism filling the power vacuum left by popular uprisings in Tunisia , Egypt and Jordan has become a concern to many in the West . \nThough this is certainly a possibility , so far the demonstrations have been led by young people demanding greater political participation and economic opportunity . \nThey represent a broad coalition focused primarily on democratic aims , and motivated in large part by a stark gap between rising expectations and reality : Recent economic growth has too often failed to trickle down to the working poor . \nIn Tunisia and Egypt , as much as 30 percent of university graduates are unemployed . \nIf more democratic political systems do emerge from this unrest , however , expect Islam to play a larger role in government . \nIndeed , youth across the region increasingly look to Turkey as a political model to emulate , and local Islamist parties are poised to take advantage of greater political freedoms . \nIn Tunisia , Rachid Ghannouchi , leader of the formerly banned Nahda party , returned this week from 20 years ' exile in London . \nIn Egypt , the Muslim Brotherhood has played an increasingly assertive role , and expects to be included in any transition process . \nIn Jordan , where the Muslim Brotherhood is not banned and already has its own political party , leader Hammam Saeed has been actively calling for Arabs to topple U.S.-backed leaders throughout the region . \nAlthough strategic interests such as the Suez would not necessarily be jeopardized by a more Islamist Middle East , new regimes with stronger Islamic elements would likely be less cooperative on issues from counterterrorism to the peace process . \nM. Nazif Shahrani , chairman of the Department of Near Eastern languages and Cultures , and professor of Anthropology , Central Asian and Middle Eastern Studies at Indiana University-Bloomington : The Jasmine Revolution in Tunisia sparked by the self-immolation of a young street vendor brought the regime of the dictator Zine El Abidin Ben Ali down . \nNow the revolution has spread across the region , unleashing the anger and frustration of millions who have suffered silently for decades across the Middle East . \nThe few who had dared to take up arms against the dictators were at first dismissed as terrorists by the dictators and their patrons . \nNow , the masses in the Arab streets -- in Tunis , Cairo , Alexandria , Sana'a , Amman , etc. -- have come out to peacefully and persistently demand their liberation from being treated as mere slaves and subjects , and not citizens , by the few corrupt power elites with access to weapons , military and political backing from the West . \nThis citizen-servitude during the past decades has been justified by dictators and their Western backers in the name of maintaining political stability . \nBut these so-called stable regimes are responsible for the poverty , unemployment and poor living conditions of their people , due to corruption , cronyism and oppression by the undemocratic regimes . \nThe educated but unemployed youth of the Arab world are fed up with these regimes and their backers . \nThese regimes can not be reformed , and the people on the Arab streets demand that they must go and make way for popular democratic governance systems which can bring real stability to the region . \nIt is time for the West to stop supporting dictatorships and start listening to the legitimate and much delayed demands of the Arab public for real and popular democracy in the Middle East and beyond . \nBlake Hounshell , managing editor of Foreign Policy : In `` Al Irhab wal Kabab '' -- `` Terrorism and Kebab '' -- the omnipresent Egyptian comedic actor Adel Imam plays a man who visits the Mugamma , the hulking government building overlooking Cairo 's Liberation Square . \nThe Mugamma symbolizes everything the Egyptian state has become : bloated , inefficient , uncaring , and deeply corrupt . \nImam 's character , Ahmed , has a simple request : Can you transfer my children 's school ? \nAs his fellow citizens aimlessly wander the hallways in search of assistance , he gets the runaround from one bureaucrat after another . \nFinally , exasperated , Ahmed gets into a scuffle with one official and , in the ensuing melee , grabs a rifle from a bewildered guard and fires it in the air . \nSeizing the moment , he decides to take the entire building hostage . \nAsked to list his demands , he orders kebabs for everyone -- meat being a rare treat for Egypt 's impoverished masses . \nThe 1992 film was a smash hit , and ranks among the most popular Egyptian films of all time . \nFor all its slapstick silliness , it resonated deeply with a population that , even then , was exhausted after decades of failed experiments in socialism and half-hearted liberalization . \nEighteen years later , Egyptians -- or Arabs , for that matter -- are n't going to be satisfied simply by having their basic economic needs met . \nAs the crowds gathering in Cairo 's Tahrir Square and throughout the Arab world are showing , they will accept nothing less than wholesale change -- and are risking their lives to get it . \nJulie Taylor , a Middle East specialist who lived in Egypt for five years , is a political scientist at the RAND Corp. : There is no clear political party or leader ready to step in , if the regime in Egypt falls . \nHowever , this protest is not without leadership ; it is spearheaded by a large network of Egyptian human rights groups and other citizens . \nThey have long challenged the Mubarak regime on humanitarian issues as greater independence of the judiciary , protections for minorities , and maintenance of stated protections found in the Egyptian constitution . \nActivists in these groups have been trained in nonviolent civic protest tactics . \nThey have networked with democratic activists in other countries for four years or more . \nThe Bush and Obama administrations have followed their activities . \nAlthough the protesters make up a disembodied movement , many of their coordinators are known to the U.S. administration . \nThey are the ones handing out water and organizing successive protests . \nWhen ElBaradei , the Nobel Laureate and a leading critic of the government , came to Egypt , he met with the main network of civil society leaders to determine if there was support for him . \nIt is this network that is hoisting him to the fore . \nThis network remains highly meaningful . \nIn countries such as Jordan and Morocco , political reform would not require the removal of the monarchy , because these countries could evolve into constitutional monarchies in which the monarch remains as a figurehead . \nThis makes political reform less threatening and more possible . \nIn such cases , the monarch is more likely to be open to political change . \nThis is not an option in republics such as Libya , Yemen , and Syria . \nThe opinions expressed in these commentaries are solely those of the writers . \n"}

'' \nRany Ibrahim , 32 , who left Cairo , Egypt , in 2003 to study in Canada , told CNN iReport that the public university system there was `` really bad . '' \n`` I did n't feel I got the education I deserved , '' he said . \n`` You get the degree , but you feel like you do n't know much . '' \nIbrahim said the class sizes were large , and there was little personal time with professors . \n`` The professors do n't have the power to teach freely , -LRB- and -RRB- the technology is very old , '' Ibrahim said . \n`` Instead of having a few entrusted qualified graduates , you have many , many graduates but with really poor education . '' \nFor previous generations in these countries , there were two job options after schooling : the private sector or the public sector . \nHowever , because of the poor quality of education , it 's difficult for many of this generation to get a quality job in the private sector , Assaad said . \nMeanwhile , jobs in the public sector -- essentially those provided by the government -- are shrinking as economies transition from a state-led to market-led mode of development and the number of people grows . \n`` Employers know a government degree is worth nothing , that they do n't really learn much , '' said Ibrahim , the Egyptian expatriate The oil-rich countries in the Gulf -- Oman or the United Arab Emirates , for example -- are an exception , Assaad said . \nThey can still deliver on the bargain because of oil revenue . \nAcross the region , unemployment rates are about 11 percent , according to `` Generation in Waiting . '' \nUnemployment rates for those between the ages of 15 to 29 are much higher , ranging from 20 to 30 percent in most countries . \nIn Algeria , it is nearly 46 percent and about 45 percent in Iraq . \nMany wait two to three years to get their first job , the book says . \nAnd there is a gender gap , with young women often having the most difficulty finding a job . \nMany of the region 's young people are having difficulties finding housing and are delaying marriage because of the bleak economic prospects , the book says . \n`` It was very hard to get a job . \nI got a couple of jobs , but you have to show connections , '' Ibrahim said . \n`` My family helped me get jobs , but I always had a hard time to get a job that fit or made me feel fulfilled . '' \nHe eventually won a scholarship and moved to Canada , leaving his family behind , to pursue a graduate degree in information technology . \nImagine a generation the size of the baby boomers in the United States trying to find a job in the U.S. economy of the late 1970s or the early 1980s , and you 'll have a rough equivalent of what 's happening across the region , Assaad said . \n`` There 's going to be a lost generation , in some sense , '' he said . \nIt is a generation whose aspirations and expectations have been stifled , with little outlet for their grievances and frustrations other than to take to the streets . \n"}

WOULD NOT ! \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 2:30 pm | if people said that they wont need the leader any more i believe that there is a big reason that made all of those people to go out and protest , and in Egypt people are dying suffering living for 2 $ a day !!! for the God sake what kind of life that a person could live for only two dollars a day !! emagine that this person has a family to support , kids , parents , wife or what ever ... who could survive for only 2 $ aday , while Mubarak got money from the USA every year around 1.5 bilion dollar !! what the hell did he do with this money !! why is it always work like this at the Arab countries where the government is rich and people are poor the same in Sirya , Jordan , Arabia Saudia and others ... why it musr be this way !!! is it right that arab leaders believe in '' If you want to have peace in your country you must have a poor people so that they will obay you no matter what !!!! '' February 2 , 2011 at 2:30 pm | I am not familiar with the Egyptian government system , but I keep hearing words like President Mubarak will not seek re-election and he will not be on the ballot again in Sept. . \nMy question is , if they hated the President so much why if there were elefctions did the Egyptian people keep VOTING him into office over the last 30 years ?? February 2 , 2011 at 2:32 pm | It has been standard oper . \nprocedure for gov ` t. to spend EVERY extra dime collected from revenues for decades . \nThere has never been any thought to saving for a `` rainy day '' . \nThis is a recipe for disaster . \nThat said , the Soc . \n`` Trust '' Fund has become a hot-potato . \nThere is talk about moving back the age for `` full retiremenmt '' age , lowering cost of living raises , and even turning over the `` fund '' to the private sector . \nNow that the Fed has sucked it dry to the tune of 2-5 TRILLION dollars , they want to hand it off to somebody else . \nIf the Fed tries to evade its ratified and inferred contract to manage and disperse the fund with `` trust '' , -LRB- see '' early English law -RRB- our monies extracted thru legal extortion , all Hell is going to break loose . \nThere are millions of Americans already living at or below the poverty level . \nThey can not sacrifice that which is theirs already . \nI will be in the FRONT of the protestors . \nI will have nothing left to lose . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 2:33 pm | One Reason for Peaceful Protest is When Freedom of Religion is expunged from the Public Arena . \nThe turmoil in Egypt is incongruous to the original intent of those involved . \nBoth sides were eager to effect a rap-rosh-ma to their bitter feud that unfortunately turned into violence . \n-LRB- ISAIAH Chapter 19 -RRB- -LRB- KJV -RRB- gives an in-depth prediction of the future of Egypt . \nthis is why I do n't normally bother with these things ... ... ...

February 2 , 2011 at 2:37 pm | i went to a protest last night in front of the egyptian embassy in ny . \ni think ev1 needs to be free . \ni think all the egyptians need to ban together and fight for freedom . \nno one deserves to be treated like dirt . \nwhats going on over there now is soooo very sad , FREE FREE EGYPT ! \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 2:50 pm | If i knew that no matter how hard i worked for a better life and that my destiny is still going to be living in poverty then a protest is definitely needed . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 2:50 pm | Israel future would be promising with democratic neighbors not with dictator oppresses his people . \ni am sure Israel economy would be more stronger and it would lead the region only when there is justice peace between people in the middle east . \nWe should remember that before 1948 Jewish Egyptian businessmen were admired by the rest of Egyptians because they were honest and trustworthy . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 2:51 pm | I think I would if it was nessessary and it could become nessessary . \nThese days things have gotten to wherethe government is not for the people . \nI do not think I plan on doing so anytime soon though . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 2:55 pm | After reading some of the comments on here , I 'm not sure America is ready for a revolution . \nThe divide amongst the people in this nation is sometimes seemingly wider than the divide between people who call themselves revolutionaries make between themselves and corrupt , oppressive governments . \nIndeed , something of extraordinary magnitude would be required in my opinion to ever close that divide we have between the people . \nAt that point , we would maybe be ready for a revolution , but for only one thing , TO SHOW OUR UNITY AS A PEOPLE , and for nothing else ! \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 2:55 pm | Everyone talks about how it is unconstitutional to require everyone to have health insurance , but no one ever mentions the most obvious parallel . \nAuto insurance is required in most states . \nIn South Carolina if your insurance is dropped you are charged $ 5 a day for every day that you are uninsured . \nIf the health care mandate is found unconstitutional then I would love for the auto insurance mandate to also be found unconstitutional . \nDo n't get me wrong , I 'm all for mandated health insurance . \nI 'm 44 and I 've had health insurance for 2 years of my adult life . \nMy employer for instance is making all the full-timers part-time so they do n't have to give them benefits . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 2:59 pm | I 'm ready to go to the streets now for what the Federal Reserve has done to this country . \nI am ashamed of our government which is run by the Federal Reserve and the destruction they have caused the American people who have lost so many homes . \nIf I had the money because everything takes money , I would want to encourage and organize us all to stop making our mortgage payments all at once and maybe that will show them how tired we are all of struggling to feed our families while they all still enjoy solid gold faucets in their homes . \nYes , I believe that Egypt has gone to the streets for the same reasons and I just wonder when it may happen here in our streets . \nHow much more can we take . \nThe suicide rate has skyrocketed and where will it all end ? \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 3:03 pm | We traveled through Egypt this past September and were in Cairo . \nIf you 've been there you saw what was worth protesting for ... by day the residential sections of the inner city look like ghost towns . \nBut if you look carefully you see that people are living there in that multitude of apartment buildings that are unfinished , like the builders ran out of money and abandoned them . \nThere are no window panes , no lights or doors ... only empty hulls housing the people of Cairo , who are forced to `` steal '' electricity by connecting illegally somewhere else and then hide what they 're doing . \nYou know they are there only because you see their laundry hung out to dry in the mornings ... nights are dark so as not to attract attention to their existence . \nWe were told this was government corruption at work ... buildings would go up and then the government would shut down construction claiming it was illegal . \nAnd yet there the people lived , everywhere , illegally and so without any government services available to them . \nWe saw mountains of trash literally mounded and heaped all along the waterways and were told that the government contracted out trash service to another country that never performed ... looked to us more like that money might never have really gone anywhere in the first place ; but clearly no trash or disposal service existed anywhere that we could see . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 3:04 pm | I believe I can protest on the streets if my president does not fullfil and deliver the required leadership that is going to benefitial to his people and his administration . \nBut now like Mubarak , it is authorotrian\\/dictatorship 30 years without improvement in the country as well as the Egyptian people whatsoever . \nIts now right for the Egptian people yo do whatever is possible for them to oust Mubarak from power so that democracy can prevail in Egypt . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 3:08 pm | How horrendous to bring animals into such a human disaster ... are we back in the middle ages with the Inquisition ? \nIf we allow such horror to become acceptable on the streets of Egypt , as a world , let us stop this madness . \nPlease President Hosni Mubarak , please step forward and denounce this violence on behalf of his support . \nIf he does not do anything to stop this , he should be removed immediately by the army . \nThe government clearly needs a special leader to step forward and express the will of the masses of people , who were non-violent in nature . \nI hope this demonstration is resolved and these people are treated with the respect they surely deserve . \nProtest ONE more federal or state job created before they fire , retire and strip the benefits of the thousands of them who have done nothing but collect and succumb their whole sorry lives . \nThen protest one day for every dollar of foreign aid unless it goes DIRECTLY to qualified non-profit organizations for the relief of people suffering . \nOnce each and every politician learns this , we 'll be okay . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 3:20 pm | The U.S. needs to start taking care of it 's own people . \nThere are no jobs , no S.S. increase , people are losing their homes , food prices are rising , no health insurance and no future for the younger generation ! \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 3:23 pm | Lost my home , lost my car , lost all my money , lost my good credit , and unemployed for over 38 months . \nAnd the people that '' have '' stay , just be happy with nothing so we can enjoy our life . '' '' \nThat 's what they are protesting about in Egypt . \nA very small amount of people with to much , and a very large amount of people with to little . '' \nPROTEST '' There is only one way this world '' not just Egypt '' is going to change . \nDo I sound angry , what do I have to be angry about . \nAnger is to small of a word for what I am . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 3:29 pm | Can US Goverment support democracy now February 2 , 2011 at 3:45 pm | Simply put , I 'm ready to hit the streets now ! \nI am tired to death of watching our government shove money at the Wall Street barron-thieves and the multi-national corporate interests while attacking what little assistance the middle class and poor receive to balance the ledger . \nExample : for the first time in decades , the amount received by those on SSI has stayed flat for 2 years running while there is -LRB- ha-ha -RRB- `` no inflation '' to adjust for because the government -LRB- conveniently -RRB- took food and fuel out of the index calculation . \nThese folks ca n't work even ONE HOUR PER WEEK at minimum wage without having reductions in their piddly disability payments ! \nBut I 'm sure the poor can appreciate that the cost of private planes , luxury cars and vacation homes is much lower ! \nOur president is complicit in this scheme to give more and more to the richest in America while looking to the rest of us to pay for it . \nBut what easier target is there than the poor , the handicapped and the informationally challenged to steal from ? \nIt 's only a matter of time until Americans wake up and serious , violent class warfare breaks out . \nAnd the U.S. is not like Egypt where no one there seems to have a gun ... February 2 , 2011 at 4:20 pm | Some of the comments on this topic are beyond moronic . \nHow about protesting when the government reaches beyond its Constitutional authority ? \nNope -- apparently that 's too complicated for most on here to understand . \nInstead , we get idiotic social security justifications . \nCan you be any more selfish ? \nI swear , our founders would be so very ashamed of what we have become . \nWe do not deserve the sacrifice they made . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 6:02 pm | Nothing would make me ready to burn the country . \nNot being wronged by a corrupt government or anything else . \nKilling to repay for killing has not worked in the last 1000 years and will not work in the next 1000 . \nLet 's give love and kindness a chance . \nKindness to repay cruelty . \nBryan i think you and i had agreed that cnn is obligated to co-operate with the gov. and use this opinions against us . \nPeople think this opinions related blogs are innocent and harmless but their a great tool for the gov. to use against us and control the masses . \nThey know now what most of us are thinking . \nPeople just blog stuff that gives them selfs away . \nKnowing is have the battle cheesy catch phrase but its true . \nU.S might not have won many wars but they know from experience how manipulate people and gov. to do their will . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 8:08 pm | Who 's says it has to be violent ? \nWe can have a strong protest without it being violent . \nMartin Luthern King prooved that . \nThank you !! February 2 , 2011 at 9:38 pm | I would protest if I felt that policies put in place by the Government would cause my children to suffer . \nI am very fortunate to be a female born in the United States . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 9:41 pm | i would protest if they tried to take away my freedom to love jesus . . \npeople are hurting each other over the color of skin and how much money you have ... . . \nit is really small if you look at the big picture . \nand for those that think that there is freedom there is no such thing unless you are white . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 9:51 pm | Protest ? \nWhat is happening in Egypt is a REVOLUTION . \nA protest is what happens at the G20 summit . \nThis here is an uprising , a true revolution . \nSo the real question you should be asking is , `` What would you revolt for ? '' \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 10:34 pm | Is mainland China allowing its people to be informed of the situation in Egypt , or is their government afraid the people will `` get ideas ? '' \nDo you think any other countries will revolt like Egypt has ? \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 12:11 am | Your car model affects your premium . \nYou wo n't get these numbers from your insurer ; in fact , you may not be able to get them at all get all the facts from clearance auto insurance website February 3 , 2011 at 1:10 am | How could you tcouse -LRB- y 'm franch-canadien -RRB- galiany to coment on the situation on egipt considering is vies on Izreal and the link he made wih the terorist of 911 nand wath is the situation in israel ! \nThis person should not have a say in that situation-it 's misgiden eaven dengerus ! \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 3:26 am | Not to sound all mushy about being an American , but I ca n't think of one darn thing that would get me out there swinging a baseball bat , except for a baseball . \nIn this country we do n't have to step outside our homes to protest . \nWe can make a nice cup of tea and do it at our computers . \nDown with ... something ! \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 11:21 am | I 'm a christian Egyptian . \nI see a great danger in forcing Mubarak to step down now . \nThis will destabilise Egypt & throw it into chaos . \nSo please understand that this could lead to a civil war in Egypt & a revolution by the Islamists . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 11:25 am | If religious people changed the rules for separation between church and state . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 12:47 pm | An unjust law is no law at all Saint Augustine I would protest for not having a job and being able to feed my family I would protest for the fear implanted in the hearts of people I would protest for no future that we could see coming ahead Ali bin Abitalib said if poverty was a man , I would have killed him February 3 , 2011 at 1:16 pm | Ultra rich corporations\\/people have bought and sold our democracy . \nWe no longer elect our leaders . \nThe corporations that finance our elections do . \nAnd politicians know this . \nTherefore they know that when elected they work for corporate interests , not American interests . \nWhy are the Banks , financial service companies , insurance companies that caused this recession and were bailed out with our tax dollars -LRB- not theirs , since they do n't pay taxes -RRB- right back to making record profits and the average american is still struggling with no end in sight ? \nI think that this is the biggest threat to our democracy and we should be out in the streets demanding that elections are reformed so that they can no longer purchase the power that should be ours by right . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 1:19 pm | Ali you have to dig deeper into `` The Muslim Brotherhood '' for the people ! \nDont take what they 're saying now as fact and dont believe it ! \nIf the want to change something now then maybe they should change there own constitution which says they dont recognize Israel , they want sharia -LRB- sp -RRB- law , womens rights , etc. !!! Im absolutely not in favor of Mubarick but you have to ivestigate further on the this subject they are not good yet they are the only organized group in Egypt !!!!!!!!! February 3 , 2011 at 1:54 pm | I hope that Egypt and all of those countries tear israel apart and finally get rid of those bastards . \nAfter learning of the USS Liberty and what happened to cover up the deaths of innocent Americans , israel can rot in he -- ll for all I care . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 2:05 pm | Gee , lets see , standing up against teabaggers . \nI do n't think 3000 against 200,000,000 teabaggers would be very good odds . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 2:53 pm | Your comment talking down to those who are concerned about the erosion of our U.S. constitutional rights was very offensive . \nYou say because dictator run countries repress their people , we should be thankful that we have the rights we do . \nWe have them because some people love our country enough to work to protect these rights . \nWe are the only country in the world that has defined those rights . \nIt is hard to understand how huge numbers of people like yourself , could take protecting them so lightly . \nYou just do n't get what a great country America was originally designed to be . \nI was raised in the 1950s and it is very obvious to me that America as the Land of the Free is barely breathing on life support . \nMaybe you should do a piece on it . \nSome honest work and research may just clue you in what America used to be about . \nSome had wonderfully free lives . \nAmericans should fight hard to raise those who do n't to the same level . \nNot lower American freedoms for everyone . \nThere is a critical mass working hard to chip away at our basic rights . \nThe small percentage of them we have left . \nI do enjoy your show . \nWould watch more if you raised it a few I.Q. points . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 3:15 pm | When they tell me I ca n't believe in MY GOD ANYMORE !!!!!!! When I ca n't go to church and worship my Lord and Savior . \nEveryone needs to wake up soon , because the Lord is coming and everyone will have to answer then . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 3:42 pm | It did n't start there , it wo n't stop there , but the whole world watched as the people of the nation united , not just for their own good , but for the good of their neighbors , their brothers and sisters and mothers and fathers . \nThey united against oppression and injustice . \nThey united to show the world that a king , a dictator , or even an entire federal government is NOTHING without the support of its people . \nI think the wording of your question is irresponsible . \nAsking `` What would make you angry enough to participate in a violent protest ? '' \nimplies that violence is acceptable , when it is n't . \nNothing justifies the rock and molotov cocktail throwing or running people down with a car . \nThe question should have been `` Would you ever participate in a violent protest , and , if so , what would make you do that ? '' \nThe answer should be `` No , I would n't . '' \nI find it scary that some people indicate they would actually resort to violence , especially since most of the people responding live here in the USA . \nThey are talking about possibly inflicting death or seriious injury on people -- is this what we 've become ? \nBy the way , there was a lot of talk after the Arizona shooting about talk inciting violence . \nI think you should think twice about the way you word your questions in the future . \nFebruary 3 , 2011 at 8:44 pm | For what would you protest ? \nYour question suggests that American do n't protest . \nI would have agreed with that before the Obama administration , and the Republican and Tea Party demonstrations these past two years . \nJohn Mayer `` Waitiing '' is no longer . \nWe protest , but we have a democratic system that listens to us so protesters do n't have to go to the extreme that Egypt is . \nI protested for my union in San Diego , twice . \nThere are lots of ways to protest . \nI 've been protesting against homelessness and substandard housing through Habitat for Humanity since 1999 . \nProtesting is n't always with sticks and stones , sometimes it 's with a hammer and nail . \nFebruary 5 , 2011 at 12:25 am | Again what makes me angry is the people who despite the fact that the president announced that he will leave , they still there demonstrating . \nA simple employee in a modest company would give a month notice before he leaves , what about a country like Egypt . ? \nplease go back to work this is what Egypt needs now , Egypt needs the youth the people to protect her not to destroy her . \nHe will leave he has dignity and pride . \nFebruary 5 , 2011 at 7:01 am | I would take to the streets to force reform on our banks . \nBoth the Democrats and Republicans receive too much re-election money from Wall Street and will not put in true reform without protests from the public . \nFebruary 11 , 2011 at 7:10 pm | I agree with Robert from Tulsa `` If we had the courage of our founders , we would already be in the streets . '' \nLook around , the government has been taking over for years now . \nFunding for the Arts & Humanities ? \nI could go on and on with the list of funding for the American people that is or will be gone . \nEven our money system is controlled by the Federal Reserve -- which is a PRIVATE corporation , NOT controlled by the government . \nIn Wisconsin they are basically trying to abolish the Union -- that was enough to make them protest -LRB- go Wisconsin ! -RRB- . \nThe banks and big corporations have been bailed out with billions upon billions of taxpayer dollars -- but the unemployed are being denied funds . \nWire tapping , internet kill switches , surveillance -- all without warrant . \nReally people , look around . \nThings are not as rosy as you would like them to be . \nThere is so much more to be angry about . \nWe are not the countries that are protesting , but we are headed in that direction quickly . \nI would protest for our Rights , our Constitution , the things that our Founding Fathers believed in -- when the People get angry enough to do something about it . \nOne person a Revolution does not make . \nFebruary 20 , 2011 at 9:32 am | -LRB- required , but will not be displayed -RRB- CNN welcomes a lively and courteous discussion as long as you follow the Rules of Conduct set forth in our Terms of Service . \nComments are not pre-screened before they post . \nYou agree that anything you post may be used , along with your name and profile picture , in accordance with our Privacy Policy and the license you have granted pursuant to our Terms of Service . \nMe and my producer @EliseMiller At LAPD HQ look at this artsy shot thanks to our photographer . \n3:53 pm ET February 11 , 2013 RETWEET @ChasityBlues hey -- he was nervous . \ngive him a break . \npoor guy 's wife is stuck ! \n"}

'' \n`` There are usually a line of thugs outside a protest who are waiting there , '' he said . \n`` They 're dressed in plain clothes , and then they 'll usually go and attack the protesters . \nEgyptians have seen this for quite some time , and that 's why they were able to recognize what was going on fairly quickly . '' \nThe global rights group Amnesty International said it has documented the use of unsavory forces by Egyptian authorities to disperse political gatherings in election years . \n`` It looks like much of this violence is being orchestrated by the Egyptian authorities in order to force an end to the anti-government protests , restore their control and cling onto power in the face of unprecedented public demands for them to go , '' said Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui , the deputy director for the Middle East and North Africa at Amnesty International . \nAn Interior Ministry spokesman denied on state-run television that police identification cards had been confiscated from demonstrators . \nHe said if they had been , they were were stolen or fake . \nBut state television reporting Wednesday did not always match CNN 's own observations of what was happening in Tahrir Square . \nSeveral CNN journalists heard from pro-Mubarak demonstrators that they worked for the government . \nStaff from the national petrochemical company said they had been ordered to come and protest . \nAmnesty International researchers said witnesses told them of `` lorry loads '' of pro-Mubarak supporters leaving Wednesday morning from Mahalla , north of Cairo . \n`` These -LRB- pro-Mubarak -RRB- protests were organized by the government and the ruling National Democratic Party , '' analyst Kamal Zakher told CNN . \nThe government mustered government workers and lawmakers whose seats are threatened , he said . \nShould Obama take Egypt ` behind scenes ' ? \nHeavy gunfire heard in Cairo Triage on the streets of Cairo `` They were ordered to go out today . \nThey are well organized and that is suspicious -- especially the use of camels and horses . \nThese are abnormal techniques to demonstrate , '' he said , referring to the shocking charge of about 50 or 60 mounted men through Tahrir in the middle of the afternoon . \nAnd Emad Shahin , a Mideast analyst at the University of Notre Dame , said `` reliable contacts in Egypt '' told him the counter-protesters were organized `` by Mubarak himself , '' with the aid of businessmen who support him . \n`` The whole objective is actually to give the impression that there is still support for Mubarak and to force the demonstrators out of Tahrir Square , '' Shahin said . \nHe said the embattled president `` is presenting a very difficult choice before the Egyptian people -- either liberty or security -- and he is hoping that they will choose security at the expense of liberty . '' \nIn Washington , White House spokesman Robert Gibbs expressed concerns about the outbreak of violence . \n`` The president and this administration strongly condemn the outrageous and deplorable violence that 's taking place on the streets of Cairo , '' Gibbs said . \n`` Obviously , if any of the violence is instigated by the government , it should stop immediately , '' Gibbs added . \nState television called the pro-Mubarak demonstrators tourism workers . \nAt least some Egyptians working in the tourism industry are known to be genuinely upset at the anti-Mubarak demonstrators , accusing them of hurting their business by bringing instability . \nZakher also said it was suspicious that security forces did not intervene to break up the violence . \n`` There were no police or military to separate the two crowds at the beginning and that 's also suspicious enough to implicate the security agencies , '' Zakher said . \nJournalist and protestor Reham Saeed told CNN she saw men with police uniforms go into hotels on the way to Tahrir Square and then come out wearing civilian clothes , joining the pro-Mubarak protesters . \nShe called that an act of `` betrayal . '' \nState TV interviewed several people at the demonstration who said they backed the president because he had provided stability and independence . \n`` For 30 years , we lived in peace . \nPresident Mubarak kept us safe and secure for 30 years instead of being a country that takes orders from external forces just like -LRB- U.S. President Barack -RRB- Obama now wants , '' Iman Abu Futuh , a pro-Mubarak demonstrator , said on Nile TV . \n`` They want us to be another Iraq and this will not happen . '' \nAnother man said , `` I did n't cry when my father died . \nI cried when Mubarak spoke yesterday . \nI grew up watching him , seeing him , having him as my leader and the great president of this nation . '' \nAnd a female demonstrator said : `` Mubarak is our father . \nNo one can insult and ridicule their elders . \nIf we do that , we belittle ourselves . \nThis is how we destroy our country .

'' \nShe encountered an enthusiastic crowd . \nAt one point , a large group of cheering protesters broke through the police line and into the square . \nPolice lobbed tear gas and used water cannons . \nBut the crowd would not be moved . \nGallery : Protesters take to the streets The evolution of Egypt 's protests So began the international crisis still unfolding in Egypt . \nSeveral Americans who made it out of the country shared their experiences with CNN ; their stories provide a front-row seat to history in a nation where communication with the outside world is spotty at best . \nA curfew went into effect at 3 p.m. Tuesday and extends until 8 a.m. Wednesday . \nThe internet has been shut down , as has phone service . \nThe turmoil has paralyzed daily life in other ways , with food shipments spare and many groceries closed . \nGas is running low in some areas , and many banks have closed . \nNile TV has set up a hotline for citizens to call in and report bread shortages . \nInternational leaders are monitoring the situation closely . \nAmid the chaotic street scenes , foreign governments -- including Australia , Canada , China , India , Israel , Mexico , Russia and the United States -- have launched evacuation efforts to get their citizens out . \nAbout 52,000 Americans are believed to be in Egypt . \nMore than 2,600 have asked to be evacuated , a figure expected to rise in coming days . \nThe Americans who left Egypt were students and tourists -- all sharing a passion for Egypt . \nIn Alexandria , Tik Root , a student from Middlebury College , had returned to Egypt in mid-January to continue his studies in Arabic . \nLike many U.S. students , he left with a mix of emotions : excited , happy and concerned for the Egyptian people . \nDiane and Gaynor Kelley of Chicago were concluding a dream vacation , a cruise down the Nile River . \nThe couple said they feel lucky to be alive but remain concerned for the Egyptians who helped them escape . \nOne of their tour guides was shot . \nTaking it to the streets Youngblood left work early last Wednesday , the first day after the protests began . \nResidents still seemed in awe : `` Wow , people really came together . '' \nBut word spread that police were going to crack down and make sweeping arrests of people on the streets . \nMany felt it was best to leave before the clashes intensified . \nAs she walked downtown , Youngblood said she was struck by the silence in the city of 8 million . \nDowntown was abandoned : `` It was really surreal because Cairo is not a quiet place . '' \nShe continued on , still unsure if the unrest would build and what could come next . \nBy Thursday , Facebook and Twitter were silenced . \nThen , text messaging was shut down . \nBy nightfall , residents were cut off from the internet and phone service . \n`` The motivations behind it were scarier than the actual lack of information , '' Youngblood said . \nEgyptians prepared to take to the streets en masse the next morning . \nOn Thursday night , Youngblood 's friends began referring to the movement as a revolution . \n`` It had n't really hit me until then that people were thinking of this as a revolution , '' she told CNN . \n`` I had thought of this as a string of protests and people just wanting to protest . \nI was n't sure what direction people really knew they wanted to take it . '' \nWith communication limited , people worried : What is the government planning if they 're cutting off access to the outside world ? \nGoogle connects Egyptians to Twitter Egypt unites , tells Mubarak ` go ' At a glance : Nations facing unrest The streets erupted in protest Friday . \nRoot , the student from Middlebury , stood in the middle of the madness in Alexandria . \nA government building was burned . \nPolice fired rubber bullets and launched tear gas canisters . \n`` I saw people coming back bloodied from the front lines , '' he said . \nAt times , a wave of anti-Americanism swept through the crowd . \nOne man picked up a spent tear gas canister . \nHe held it up for all to see . \n`` Made in America , '' it said . \nIf people asked , Root decided to tell people he was from Mexico . \nTo survive , it seemed the right thing to say . \nBy Saturday , police were gone . \nOrdinary citizens had taken over . \nThey were directing traffic and setting up neighborhood watches to prevent looting . \n`` It was one of the coolest things I 've seen in my life , '' Root said . \nScary end to Nile cruise The Kelleys had been isolated on their cruise down the Nile . \nThey had heard rumblings of something going on but did n't know quite what . \nThe vacation was wrapping up . \nThey caught a flight into Cairo . \nTheir tour guide remained confident they would be safe . \nWhen they arrived , no other flights were taking off . \nThe couple , and the rest of the tour group , were stranded and cut off from the outside world . \n`` You 're caught in something for which you have no control whatsoever of your own destiny , '' Gaynor Kelley said . \nTheir Egyptian hosts , with the Abercrombie & Kent tour group , helped make sure they were safe . \nThey got them food and put them up in a hotel while working around-the-clock to see how the group could leave the country . \nThe father of one of their Egyptian guides was shot as the group made its way to the airport . \nThe Kelleys have n't heard any updates on his condition . \n`` Our last day getting to the airport was the scariest , '' Diane Kelley recalled . \nMilitary police were stopping cars at roadblocks set up outside the airport . \nGunshots could be heard in the distance . \nShe said she thought about the recent bombing at the airport in Moscow . \nThe Egyptian tour guides offered constant reassurance . \nOnce inside the airport , flight after flight was canceled . \nGaynor Kelley had a sinking feeling : Will I ever make it back home ? \n`` You sort of begin to lose confidence that you 're ever going to get out , '' he said . \nFor Youngblood , leaving the country was agonizing . \nShe did n't realize how many friends she had made since August until it was time to say good-bye . \nBut by Saturday night , she said she knew it was time to go as the streets became more chaotic . \nCitizens were setting up their own neighborhood watches . \nOutside her building , men stood guard with thick plastic pipes . \nShe was armed with one too , inside her apartment . \n`` That 's when it hit me that I should get out . '' \nShe caught a flight Monday to Athens , Greece . \nShe said she plans to return to Cairo as soon as it 's safe again . \nRoot is still trying to absorb all that 's transpired in the last week . \n`` I do n't think anyone 's been able to process what has happened , '' he said , just before leaving for Europe . \nAs a college student , he 's learned more in a week than most get in a semester . \n`` This has been a very great and meaningful experience . \nIt 's taught me a lot about Egyptian politics , the Mideast and revolutions . '' \nThe Kelleys are left wondering about the folks who got them out of the country . \n`` I am thinking how grateful I am of the Egyptian people who helped us , '' Diane Kelley said . \n`` I 'm feeling very sorry for the conditions that they 're in . \nI 'm feeling very sorry that their homes are being looted , that their families are n't safe . \nThese people helped us .

\nARWA DAMON , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Well , Wolf , we saw massive crowds down in Tahrir Square again . \nJust looking at it from the outside , it would appear as if the people were demonstrating , but , instead , of course , they were celebrating , having achieved what so many are saying was unthinkable , inconceivable just three weeks ago . \nThis revolution that started out , as we have been reporting , on Facebook and Twitter , then taking on a life of its own , growing to such a degree where it truly did encompass people from all walks of Egyptian society , succeeding in bringing down one of the Middle East , what many people though was one of the Middle East 's strongest dictators , President Hosni Mubarak . \nThe crowds down today in Tahrir Square celebrating , cleaning up , repainting some parts , and also bringing in a flag in memory of those who died . \nMany people very happy , euphoric even , but at the same time , there is a growing sense of anxiety because the future is just so uncertain . \nWe 're seeing a lot of debates springing out amongst people as to whether or not they should stay in Tahrir Square as some would like to do to make sure that the military does live up to its pledges to hand over to a civilian government , that it does , in fact , lift emergency law that we do se those constitutional amendments that so many are saying the country desperately needs while others , the majority saying , look , we 've achieved it , we need to give the military a chance to do its job . \nOur focus right now has to be getting the Egyptian economy up and running again . \nThese unemployed people need to go back to work . \nThose who have n't been able to go back to work since these demonstrations began need to be doing that as well . \nThe realization that this is such an exciting but at the same time equal if not more so sensitive time for Egypt , Wolf . \nBLITZER : A real sensitive moment , Arwa , as you well know . \nIf those -- the hardliners , let 's say , the demonstrators , if they want to stay at Liberation Square or Tahrir Square , will the military let them stay or are they shall , we say , encouraging them to leave ? \nDAMON : That 's a great question , Wolf . \nAnd really that is one that we 're only going to be able to answer when we see what exactly does happen . \nThe military , so far , has not made any moves to aggressively move in throughout this entire process and remove the demonstrators themselves , but at the same time , we have been hearing the military coming out really urging the citizens to work with them , also to work with the police force which many fear and loathe trying to bring this country together again because it has been ripped apart by what happened . \nAnd there is a significant trust deficit between the people and the police , between the people and the government , and to a significantly lesser degree , between the people and the military . \nSo , the military is not likely to want to jeopardize that the thinking amongst the demonstrators that we 've been talking to . \nThey 've been saying , look , if a group does stay behind , it is likely to be smaller in number . \nThey 're going to continue to be peaceful . \nOf course , the overarching issue in all of this to bring about some sort of a revolution is the problem that this is a largely leaderless revolution . \nBetween the youth movements , there are various small pockets of groups forming each other , trying to get representation . \nOf course , there are all the other opposition groups as well . \nSo , what is going to be really critical moving forward is to try to bring about some sense of unity instead of more divisions , Wolf . \nBLITZER : Arwa Damon on the scene for us in Cairo . \nShe 's been doing an excellent job reporting as our entire team has done . \nArwa , thanks so much . \nThere are still huge questions about Egypt 's new military leadership and whether officials from the Mubarak government will continue to have power . \nI spoke earlier with the Egyptian ambassador to the United States , Sameh Shoukry , about that . \nBLITZER : Let 's talk about who 's in charge right now . \nHow does that work ? \nThe military is in charge , General Tantawi , the defense minister , is he in charge right now of the country ? \nSAMEH SHOUKRY , EGYPTIAN AMNBASSADOR TO U.S. : He is in charge by virtue of his chairmanship of the supreme military council . \nToday 's communication indicates that the council had decided to maintain the existing government as a caretaker government to govern the normal affairs of state . \nBLITZER : So , what about the Vice President Omar Suleiman ? \nWhat is his job ? \nSHOUKRY : I 'm not aware of whether Suleiman has retained any position under the new structure . \nHe was vice president to a resigning president . \nAnd I think his status , to me , at least at this moment , is unclear . \nBLITZER : Is he still the head of -- you do n't even know if he 's the head of the foreign intelligence services of Egypt ? \nHe relinquished that position when he was appointed vice president and then new person was appointed . \nBLITZER : So , it 's unclear what if any job he has . \nBut you still report to the foreign minister , I assume ? \nBLITZER : Is there a new foreign minister ? \nIs there an on old foreign minister ? \nMr. Gate was the foreign minister . \nIs he still the foreign minister ? \nSHOUKRY : Mr. Gate continues to be the foreign minister . \nAs I mentioned , the council has decided to maintain the current government as a caretaker government until it appoints a new government . \nSo , the current ministers will continue to operate and function . \nBLITZER : Stand by for more of my interview with Ambassador Shoukry . \nThat 's coming up later this hour . \nPresident Obama is warmly welcoming today 's pledge by Egypt 's new military rulers to carry out a Democratic transition and to honor Egypt 's international commitments , including its peace treaty with Israel . \nThe White House says the president made a number of phone calls to foreign leaders today to discuss developments in Egypt , including speaking to the king of Jordan and the prime ministers of Britain and Turkey . \nSome angry criticism of President Obama 's handling of the Egypt revolution from the ex-president of Egypt himself . \nWe 're talking about Hosni Mubarak . \nBrian Todd is looking into this part of the story for us . \nSome pretty amazing words from Mubarak on the eve of his stepping down . \nBRIAN TODD , CNN CORRESPONDENT : That 's right , Wolf . \nAn extraordinary conversation we 're learning about between Hosni Mubarak and a member of Israel 's parliament during the very hours when Mubarak 's fate was in the balance . \nThis was on Thursday , the day before Mubarak resigned , the day he went on national TV to say he was n't stepping down . \nI 'm told by two Israeli officials that Mubarak had a telephone conversation that day with Benjamin Ben Eliezer , a former Israeli cabinet minister and current Member of Parliament who these officials say is close to Mubarak . \nThe officials could n't give details of that conversation , but Reuters quotes Ben Eliezer as saying in a televised interview that Mubarak had some very harsh words about the U.S. goverment . \nAccording to Ben Eliezer , Mubarak said , quote , `` We see the Democracy the United States spearheaded in Iran and with Hamas , in Gaza , and that 's the fate of the Middle East . '' \nThen Eliezer quote Mubarak as saying , this is reported by Reuters now , about the U.S. government , quote , `` They may be talking about Democracy , but they do n't know what they 're talking about , and the result will be extremism and radical Islam . '' \nWe tried , but we 're unable to reach Mr. Ben Eliezer to independently verify his take on what Mubarak said . \nThe Egyptian ambassador to the United States , Sameh Shoukry told Wolf just a couple of hours ago that he does not have knowledge of that conversation . \nWolf , it is extraordinary -- we are hearing that Ben Eliezer is close to Mubarak , not necessarily unusual , but he might have a conversation with him during those hours when it 's so critical , just ingrate -LRB- ph -RRB- inside and maybe Mubarak 's bitterness at the time . \nAnd we 're also told from this Israeli parliamentarian that Mubarak on that Thursday suggested he was ready to hunker down in Cairo . \nTODD : He was defiant even until the end , maybe reflected in that speech . \nAnd , you know , we do n't know if this conversation took place before or after that speech on Thursday when Mubarak gave no indication that he would step down , but Ben Eliezer quotes Mubarak , according to Reuters , is saying , quote , `` I have been serving my country , Egypt , for 61 years . \nDo they want me to run away ? \nI wo n't run away . \nDo they want to throw me out ? \nI wo n't leave . \nIf need be , I will be killed here . '' \nYou know , it 's extraordinary to get some of that insight of these private conversations at those very tense moments . \nYou saw how he was on that speech on Thursday . \nIt was just surreal watching him up there , being that defiant . \nBLITZER : We believe he 's still in Sharm el-Sheikh , the resort at the southern tip of Sinai , the Red Sea , but we do n't even know that for 100 percent . \nTODD : For sure . \nWe do n't know where he 's going . \nThanks very much , Brian Todd reporting . \nWith successful uprisings in Tunisia and now in Egypt , the world is watching to see if other Arab countries follow suit . \nJordan is the subject of a lot of speculation right now , but that country 's foreign minister , Nasser Judeh , insists everything there is just fine . \nWe spoke by phone just a little while ago . \nVOICE OF NASSER JUDEH , JORDANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER : Jordan is Jordan . \nI 'm watching all the media outlets , and I 'm seeing the comparison , and I 'm seeing the expectations , and one would confidently say that here in Jordan , we had demonstrations as we have every year when it comes to economic issues and governments adopting policies that are unpopular . \nBut in Jordan , we enjoy freedom of speech and freedom of expression . \nAnd yes , while we have economic hardship , we still have economic stability and political stability and political reform that is initiated by its majesty , the king , by the government , that the iterance -LRB- ph -RRB- of majesty 's vision , so we 're okay . \nBLITZER : That 's the foreign minister of Jordan , we spoke a little while ago . \nWhen we come back , we 're digging deeper into the U.S. intelligence community . \nWas there a failure ? \nAnd what did the director of national intelligence , James Clapper , really mean when he said the Muslim brotherhood in Egypt is largely secular ? \nMuch more of our coverage right after this . \nBLITZER : Certainly , still a carnival atmosphere in Tahrir Square in Cairo , but there 's always the risk that Egypt 's revolution could open the door to extremism . \nListen to what the former CIA director , Michal Hayden , told CNN 's Barbara Starr . \nMICHAL HAYDEN , FORMER CIA DIRECTOR : It 's very rare for revolutions as they progress to break towards the center . \nThey generally break towards the extremes . \nAnd that 's why this has to be so carefully managed and why the Egyptian military has to be generous in its approach to this kind of change . \nOne danger , if this stalls , if people become frustrated and it breaks to the extremes , one of the extremes represented by the history , if not the present , are the Muslim brotherhood . \nAnd that would be very bad , I think , for Egypt , for the United States and for the region . \nBLITZER : Let 's bring in our national security contributor , Fran Townsend . \nShe serves on the CIA 's External Advisory Board . \nFran , thanks very much for coming in . \nWe heard the director of national intelligence , James Clapper , say he did n't necessarily think that the Muslim brotherhood would be such a threat . \nHe also , at one point , said it was largely secular and that 's causing a huge uproar that maybe he does n't understand what 's going on in Egypt . \nFRANCES FRAGOS TOWNSEND , CNN NATIONAL SECURITY CONTRIBUTOR : Well , I mean , historically , as you just head from Mike Hayden , a former CIA director , the Muslim brotherhood is really the ideological predecessor to groups like al Qaeda , very extremist , very violent . \nAfter years of repossession under the government of Mubarak , they 've been really decimated and have become more now in this revolution more politically involved . \nIn fact , they 've backed el-Baradei , the Nobel laureate , and his involvement in a new government -- BLITZER : The former head of International Atomic Energy Agency . \nAnd so , I think what you 're hearing though and in Mike Hayden statement , and I happen to agree with Mike Hayden is that while they 're weak now , you run the risk that extremists in the region will support them and will encourage them towards the fringe , towards the extreme Islamist fringe , and that would be horrible for the region . \nAnd I have to say , Wolf , our allies in the region who have suffered under extremism and been battling it like Saudi Arabia , Bahrain , Kuwait , the United Arab Emirates , they worry about the foothold of an extremist element inside Egypt like the Muslim brotherhood . \nBLITZER : And that 's why all of them reportedly were encouraging President Obama to not pressure Mubarak to step down so quickly . \nThey thought that could undermine a smooth transition . \nTOWNSEND : That 's exactly right , Wolf . \nAnd so , our allies in the region are not happy with us for the way we handled it , and they worry very much about the potential at least for extremism . \nBLITZER : Well , how much of a threat is the Muslim brotherhood in Egypt right now ? \nThe way it 's formatted to the United States , shall we say ? \nTOWNSEND : Well , they are -- the Muslim brotherhood would never be regarded as a potential ally for the United States or pro-American policy . \nThat said , they had been very weak , both politically , operationally . \nSo , at the moment , I do n't think people would regard them as a big threat -- direct threat to the United States . \nBut , again , their allies in the extremist community throughout the region including people like al Qaeda and Hamas and others , there 's the potential there . \nAnd that 's why somebody like Mike Hayden , a former CIA director , is saying , this has got to be very carefully managed , and our intelligence community is going to be key here in helping us get a sense about what direction this is going to go in . \nBLITZER : I 've somewhat studied Egypt for a long time . \nI suspect the Egyptian military leadership will keep a close eye on the Muslim brotherhood . \nThey 're not going to let them do things that the military does n't want them to do , but that 's just my assessment . \nGiven some of the early statements , Hillary Clinton , the Secretary of State saying , it was a stable situation in Egypt . \nThe vice president of the United States , Joe Biden , saying Mubarak was not a dictator . \nWas there some sort of intelligence failure in the United States , intelligence community ? \nYou serve as an adviser , external advisory board . \nWas there an intelligence failure that the U.S. did n't grasp what was going on ? \nTOWNSEND : You know , Wolf , I think it 's , right now , a little early to be able to figure that out . \nI suspect what 's going on , though , I ca n't say directly , is that we 're going to -- the intelligence community will do a self-assessment and look at what did they know and when did they know it ? \nWhat judgments did they make based on what they knew and when were they right and wrong ? \nAnd often time , we go through that sort of process in the intelligence community to be better the next time . \nI 'll tell you , the U.S. military and the Egyptian military have a very close relationship as does our intelligence community with the Egyptian intelligence community . \nAnd let 's remember , Omar Suleiman who became the vice president under Mubarak was the head of their service . \nAnd so , there are -- BLITZER : He 's now , for all practical purposes , gone . \nTOWNSEND : That 's right . \nBut as this was developing , there were lots of close relationships . \nAnd so , the fact that we did n't had a clear and good grounding and understanding of what was happening ought to be concerning to the president , given the depth of our relationship there . \nBLITZER : But you have good sources . \nThe Saudi Arabia right now , King Abdullah and others , they 're concerned . \nTOWNSEND : Absolutely , they 're concerned and rightly so . \nGiven the history of the Muslim brotherhood , given what they 've advocated in terms of violence and how they have infiltrated the neighboring countries historically to cause chaos and unrest , I do n't blame the regional allies for being very concerned . \nWhat they see -- if you 're sitting in the seat of our Arab allies , they see a 30-year ally of the United States who was cut loose , frankly , from their relationship with the U.S. because from their perspective , it was politically expedient for the U.S. to back the protesters and not Mubarak . \nForget whether or not we agree or disagree with that . \nThat is the perspective of our allies . \nAnd we 're going to have to deal with that going forward if they do n't trust us to be loyal to them . \nBLITZER : Fran Townsend served in the Bush administration as the Homeland Security adviser to President Bush , as well . \nThanks very much for coming in . \nShe 's now a CNN contributor . \nThere 's much more coming up . \nWe 're going back to Cairo . \nThey 're cleaning up Tahrir Square . \nWe 'll update you on that . \nEgyptians are certainly celebrating in Cairo , but they 're also celebrating around the world , including right here in Washington . \nOur special report continues right after this . \nBLITZER : Revolutions are n't just historic , they 're also messy . \nCNN 's Fred Pleitgen has more on the clean-up under way right now in Cairo 's Tahrir Square . \n-LRB- BEGIN VIDEOTAPE -RRB- FREDERIK PLEITGEN , CNN CORRESPONDENT : After the revolution , it 's not all celebration for the people here . \nA lot of them have come together and are actually cleaning up the area at Tahrir Square which , of course , has seen a lot of violence . \nThere 's a lot of trash also there from people camping out the past days . \nAnd now , they 're cleaning up , and they say , they believe that because they 've now taken back their country , they want to make their country clean and nice so that everyone can enjoy it and so that they , themselves , can be more proud of their revolution . \nSo , this is the new Egypt right here ? \nAnd you 're happy to do this ? \nBecause cleaning up is not everybody 's -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE : I do this for my help -- I am very , very happy to do that . \nI live with my daughters and my wife , and we come here with my friends to do that . \nPLEITGEN : And this is where it starts ? \nCleaning the streets is where it starts ? \nPLEITGEN : Looks like hard work . \nWhat are you doing ? \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : We are cleaning the new Egypt , our new Egypt . \nPLEITGEN : So , this is people taking control of their country and making it more beautiful . \nWhat does this symbolize , then ? \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : This energy inside ourselves , and just you scratch a little piece and we all came out to say , this is the new Egypt . \nThis is the new world , and I can swear and promise you , see Egypt after five years from now , just five years . \nPLEITGEN -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : There appear to be some scuffles between the military and some of the people here at some point , but the military tells us it was just a couple of folks that were causing trouble . \nThe military says it has no issues with people staying here , however , it does want to open this area at some point so businesses can reopen on Tahrir Square . \nUNIDENTIFIED MALE -LRB- translator -RRB- : It was three troublemakers . \nWe arrested them , but we let them go again . \nPLEITGEN -LRB- on-camera -RRB- : There 's a big clean-up also going on here at the barricades that lead into Tahrir Square . \nAnd of course , these barricades are so symbolic of what was happening here over the past couple of days . \nThis was the scene of some of the worst street fighting as pro-Mubarak demonstrators attacked the anti-Mubarak crowd . \nAnd of course , in the end , the anti-Mubarak demonstrators prevailed . \nNow , this area is getting cleaned up as well as we can see people who are taking control of their country and taking things into their own hands . \nFred Pleitgen , CNN , Cairo , Egypt . \nBLITZER : The celebrations that started in Egypt spread around the world including right here in Washington , D.C. CNNs Sandra Endo has more on that -- Sandra . \nSANDRA ENDO , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Wolf , here outside the Egyptian embassy in Washington , D.C. , it is a street party . \nPeople are here waving the Egyptian flag , dancing in the streets , playing music , and smiles all around . \nThey 're also holding up signs that say , Egypt 's revolution inspires the world , and that 's certainly the message they want to send out to the entire world watching all these events unfold . \nAnd this man has been here for a couple of weeks now leading the protests which is now a celebration . \nWhere were you when you heard the news and what went through your mind ? \nI just jumped , almost broke the door of the office . \nI was hysterical , ecstatic . \nThe first thing that went through my mind , that those who have died did not die in vain . \nThat was my main concern . \nI 'm not talking about those who died in 13 days . \nI 'm talking about those who have died in the past 30 years out of persecution , torture , have been killed , kidnapped by the state security police . \nSo , finally , finally , we got our country back . \n7,000 years of Egypt that is 7,000 years old was just reborn . \nENDO : What do you want to see next , though , for the country ? \nI do n't care who 's going to be there as long as it is who the people want . \nSo , what we want is a Democratic system by which nobody can abuse their powers . \nThat they will vote it . \nThe minorities will give empower women . \nThat 's what I 'm looking for . \nI 'm looking for a Democratic system and for the people to actually make their voices heard . \nENDO : All right . \nThank you so much and congratulations . \nYou can see the dancing and the celebration continues . \nWhat 's really striking , though , is the amount of young people who are out here celebrating their country 's victory and all the hard work of so many protesters who have been calling for the resignation of Mubarak and now celebrating in the historic moment of the country -- Wolf ? \nBLITZER : Sandra , thanks very much . \nWe 're going to go back to Cairo and check in with Nic Robertson . \nHe 's on the scene for us on this , the day after the successful revolution . \nAlso , more of my interview with the Egyptian ambassador to the United States , Sameh Shoukry . \nThat 's coming up right here on our special report , REVOLUTION IN EGYPT . \nBLITZER : Some protesters are staying put in Cairo 's main square refusing to leave until the country is under civilian leadership instead of military rule . \nHere 's our senior international correspondent , Nic Robertson , with the latest . \nNIC ROBERTSON , SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : Wolf , it 's still carnival party atmosphere in Tahrir square , but there 's a confusion about it as well . \nWhile we were down there watching the people come in and celebrate , young families bringing their young children in , really recognizing that this is a moment in history that they want their children to share , to remember , to be there to sort of feel the atmosphere of it , confusion because there were large groups walking away from the protests singing and chanting , `` everyone should leave now , '' `` everyone should leave now '' signaling that they believe that they should recognize what the army is saying and let the army continue as it said it will with the transition to civilian rule . \nBut on the time frame of letting this current government run through to the elections . \nThose protesters who want to remain there , who are now celebrating but are threatened to remain on in the coming days , say they want this transition to civilian rule to happen very , very quickly . \nThe army has said that their legitimate demands will be met . \nBut this is what 's happening . \nBut it really is , at the moment , still a celebration . \nBut you can see the confusion in all of this beginning to bubble up here , Wolf . \nBLITZER : Is there a clear sense that the military is in charge , that the old political leadership effectively is gone ? \nIs that what I 'm hearing , I 'm sensing , Nic ? \nROBERTSON : I think the lack of voices that we 're hearing , other than from the military at the moment , is a clear indication of that . \nThere was a moment in Tahrir Square today when the army wanted to clear away some burnt-out military vehicles . \nThey went to move them , they were part of barricades , and some of the demonstrators went to stop them . \nThey did n't want that to happen . \nThe army called in additional soldiers to come in with sort of riot gear on . \nIt got sense for a few minutes . \nA couple of people were led away . \nWe understand they will be released later . \nBut it gave an indication that the army is n't going to stand idly by , that they are going to try and sort of keep this under control and head in the direction they want to go in . \nSo at the moment , they 're very much in control . \nBut also you get the sense that they are letting this party play itself out to a degree , let everyone come and have their moment , come and have some fun , but perhaps try and regain some order as the numbers draw down , Wolf . \nBLITZER : A significant statement from the military leadership , one welcomed here in Washington , that they would honor -- Egypt would honor all of its international treaty obligations , including the peace treaty with Israel . \nThat was certainly welcome news in Israel . \nWhat are they saying in Cairo about that ? \nROBERTSON : Well , certainly it 's recognized in Washington that many of the military chiefs here have spent time training and doing programs -- military programs inside the United States . \nSo there 's certainly a thorough understanding of the military here . \nWhat they 're saying will happen here and the indications that they 're giving is that Israel -- rather , Egypt is going to recognize all its -- all its obligations , its international treaties and that nobody should expect any changes to come overnight . \nHow that will look , perhaps in six or eight months ' time , if there is a new democratically-elected political representation in this country , that may be something different . \nBut the military is really offering internationally , as well as internally , continuity at the moment , Wolf . \nBLITZER : All right . \nNic , thank you . \nThis is certainly an uncertain time for all Egyptians especially -- especially those who played some key roles in the Mubarak regime . \nI spoke a little bit earlier today with the Egyptian ambassador to the United States , Sameh Shoukry , and I asked him if the defense minister of Egypt right now is really the man in charge . \nSAMEH SHOUKRY , EGYPTIAN AMBASSADOR TO U.S. : He is in charge by virtue of his chairmanship of the Supreme Military Council . \nToday 's communication indicated that the council had decided to maintain the existing government to -- as a caretaker government to govern the normal affairs of state . \nBLITZER : So what about the vice-president Omar Suleiman ? \nWhat is his job ? \nSHOUKRY : I 'm not aware of whether Mr. Suleiman has retained any position under the new structure . \nHe was vice-president to a resigning president and I think his status , to me , at least at this moment , is unclear . \nBLITZER : And is he still the head of the -- you do n't even know if he 's the head of the Foreign Intelligence Services of Egypt ? \nSHOUKRY : No , he relinquished that position when he was appointed vice-president so a new person was appointed . \nBLITZER : So it 's unclear what , if any , job he has . \nBut you still report to the foreign minister , I assume . \nBLITZER : Is there a new foreign minister ? \nIs there an older foreign minister ? \nMr. Gheit was the foreign minister . \nIs he still the foreign minister ? \nSHOUKRY : Well , Mr. Gheit continues to be the foreign minister . \nAs I mentioned , the council has decided to maintain the current government as a caretaker government until it appoints a new government . \nSo the current ministers will continue to operate and function . \nBLITZER : I guess the question is , how does all this affect an Egyptian ambassador to the United States , this tumultuous change that occurred in your country within 18 days ? \nWhat 's been the impact on you ? \nSHOUKRY : Well , we , of course , followed every minute , every second of what has been going on with a great deal of concern and pride to see the Egyptian people undertaking this protest movement in the way that they have , peacefully , indicating their desires , their aspirations . \nAnd this outcome , I think , is one that is -- is one that all Egyptians are proud of . \nAs for myself , our service is a political service . \nWe have no political affiliations and we serve the people of Egypt -- I serve the people of Egypt and I serve of the pleasure of the current government . \nBLITZER : You 're a career diplomat . \nBLITZER : So , presumably , you 'll stay -- you 'll serve whoever the new foreign administrator of Egypt is . \nI guess the main point right now is , you 're happy that this revolution succeeded . \nIs that fair to say that ? \nSHOUKRY : All Egyptians , I think , have indicated their happiness that -- the Egyptian people have indicated what their desires and aspirations are and the people will be fine with the form of government that they accept . \nBLITZER : Are you confident that the military rulers right now -- there , in fact , these military rulers will eventually lead the way to democracy , free and fair elections ? \nSHOUKRY : Well , certainly the -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- has spoken , the population has spoken and they have spoken loud and clear . \nAnd the military and the second communicate and then the fourth communicate have made every indication that they are leading the country in accordance with the reform program that will return the rule and authority to a civilian and freely-elected government . \nBLITZER : The former president of Egypt -- I never thought I 'd be saying that -- the former president of Egypt , Hosni Mubarak , he 's reported to have had a phone conversation with a former Israeli ambassador in Cairo the day before he stepped down saying the United States , the Obama administration was naive , they did n't understand who was behind these demonstrators , the Muslim Brotherhood or Iran or Hamas and that the U.S. would regret its support for the demonstrators . \nI want you to react to that . \nSHOUKRY : I have no particular knowledge of that conversation . \nI believe the American-Egyptian relationship is a deep and lasting one , one that both parties have extracted immense interest and benefits from . \nAnd I presume that these relations will continue to flourish . \nBLITZER : I guess the question is , do you agree with Mubarak -- assuming the reports are accurate , do you agree with President Mubarak -- former President Mubarak that the U.S. is naive about the Muslim Brotherhood ? \nSHOUKRY : I believe that all factions in Egypt -- all political factions in Egypt are going to partake in developing the way forward and will do so under the supervision of this youth revolution that was widely supported and will take their lead from the electorate and from the people who will put them in office . \nBLITZER : As you know , there a lot of speculation how much money the Mubarak family amassed over the years . \nAnything from $ 2 billion or $ 3 billion to $ 70 billion . \nI have no idea how much money they amassed . \nBut we know the Swiss government froze all the bank accounts associated with the Mubarak family . \nHave you received instructions here in the United States to go after Mubarak money in private American banks ? \nSHOUKRY : We 've received no instructions in that regard . \nBLITZER : Do you know if he has amassed a lot of money here in the united states ? \nSHOUKRY : I have no idea whatsoever . \nBLITZER : Tell me something that you 're free to say today that you were n't free to say only a few days ago because there 's a new freedom in Egypt right now . \nGive me an example of the freedom that you now have . \nSHOUKRY : Well , I am free to express the position of my government without any form of restriction . \nI did that previously and I do that today . \nBLITZER : You 're free to criticize the Mubarak government ? \nSHOUKRY : I 'm not in a position to criticize . \nI 'm in a position to transmit the instructions of my government . \nSHOUKRY : It 's a very deep and close connection . \nThere 's a high level of cooperation and coordination . \nThere 's a parallelism of interest related to regional -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- . \nBLITZER : How will it be affected by this revolution ? \nSHOUKRY : From everything that has been issued in terms of the president 's statements and others , there is a recognition of the value of this revolution , of the value of Egypt 's direction in the future and it is our hope that it will strengthen this relationship . \nBLITZER : So you 're pretty happy right now ? \nBLITZER : And you 're happy about what has happened in Egypt ? \nSHOUKRY : Every Egyptian is proud that the Egyptian people have taken their future into their own hands and have been able to forge it in a peaceful and mature manner . \nBLITZER : Well , good luck to all the people of Egypt . \nThank you , Mr. Ambassador . \nYou 've been very helpful to us over these past 18 days . \nI remember when you called in to help clarify what exactly was going on because that night that Mubarak spoke out and he did n't step down , we were all confused at what was happening . \nBut the next day , we heard the Vice-President Suleiman give a one little sentence line , Mubarak is stepping down , and that was it . \nDid you ever think that would happen in your lifetime ? \nSHOUKRY : It 's a remarkable development , one which is a matter of pride for Egypt and one which I 'm sure will set Egypt on a road of great development . \nBLITZER : Ambassador Shoukry , good luck . \nBLITZER : When we come back , we 're going to the pyramids right now . \nHow are they reacting there ? \nTourism , a lifeline for Egypt . \nMuch more of our special coverage right here . \nRevolution in Egypt coming up . \nBLITZER : If you want to take the pulse of Egypt on this first day after the revolution , head to any of Cairo 's ubiquitous coffee shops . \nOnce again , here 's CNN 's Arwa Damon . \nDAMON -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : In the most traditional of Egyptian settings , there are already subtle changes . \nThe state newspapers , for example , that used to propagate the government message now praise the revolution . \nConversations center around topics untouchable three weeks ago . \nNo one was bold enough to openly express their dissatisfaction , says Hani -LRB- ph -RRB- . \nAt 61 , he 's the eldest among this group of friends . \nThey would head to the demonstration site on a near daily basis and gather here afterwards to debate . \nWe will talk about corruption and the need to dissolve parliament completely and have free and fair elections , Hani says . \nThe coffee shop is right in between Tahrir Square and state TV headquarters , where this man works as a studio director . \nI am happy and sad . \nI am sad because this is a president who carried us through wars and tough times , he explains . \nHe demonstrated against his own network on Friday , realizing he had to make a decision between right and wrong . \nHis breaking point was the day that pro-Mubarak thugs stormed through the crowds on horse and camelback , unleashing violence that claimed hundreds of lives . \nI am happy because we 've been freed of things that were forcibly imposed on us , he says . \nThe people were so repressed , it was as if we were buried alive . \nThe bubble of oppression burst , they joke , and we do n't know how to clean up the mess . \nEgypt is like a newborn baby that needs to be protected , Mustafa -LRB- ph -RRB- adds . \nAnd then after a year or two , he can stand on his own . \nEveryone in society has to do their part . \nOf course there is anxiety because we 're in an unknown transition right now , he elaborates . \nIs this going to be for the better or what 's going to happen ? \nThere 's no anxiety or fear , he jumps in , disagreeing . \nThe power is now with the military , and the military is a very respectable force . \nThey have the ability to choose the ones who are intellectual , politicians who can inject the country with major change . \nThe country has , without a doubt , already changed . \nWith so many unknown pieces thrown into the mix , no one is entirely sure how it 's going to play out . \nArwa Damon , CNN , Cairo . \nBLITZER : Not everyone is happy with the upheaval of recent weeks , especially those who rely on the country 's tourist industry which has come to a virtual standstill . \nCNN 's senior international correspondent Nic Robertson has more . \nROBERTSON : Wolf , down here in Tahrir Square , you could quite easily get the impression that the whole of Egypt is celebrating Hosni Mubarak 's removal . \nBut I went out to the pyramids earlier on today where so many tourists like to visit . \nI talked to some of the people who work out there . \nThey do n't quite share all this happiness . \nROBERTSON -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Close to Egypt 's ancient pyramids , horses charge along the lanes , but not in celebration . \nThe men here who make their living from tourists are angry . \nThis man is one of them . \nPresident Mubarak stepped down yesterday . \nHow do you feel about that ? \nROBERTSON -LRB- on camera -RRB- : Why bad ? \nROBERTSON -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : These are the streets the horse and camel riders , who so dramatically attacked and terrorized protesters in Tahrir Square , came from . \nROBERTSON : The violent images of that day helped scare the last of the dwindling tourists away . \nNow the president 's gone , he is desperately trying to rebuff their tarnished image , get the tourists back . \nWe do n't think about politics here . \nWe are not politic people . \nWe think only about our political -- it 's how much I get , how I make business , how I can work , how I can feed my family , how I can feed these horses . \nROBERTSON -LRB- on camera -RRB- : A return of the tourists ca n't come fast enough here . \nLocal businessmen say about 50,000 people are employed in the tourist industry and there are about 1,500 camels and 5,000 horses . \nAnd every day they 're not working , they 're getting hungrier . \n-LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Stables are full of idle horses , running up huge food bills . \nOne horse , about $ 15 a day . \nFifty in this stable alone . \nTourists stay away if protests continue . \nYou have done what you want , you get what you want . \nIt 's not every day we start again to think about something else , something new . \nThat 's not the way . \nROBERTSON -LRB- on camera -RRB- : But as we talk , a glimmer of better days ahead . \nROBERTSON : So how do you feel seeing these tourists up here ? \nWe would like to put our hands together and we start to help each other . \nROBERTSON -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Time to look forward and not back . \nROBERTSON : So what he 's saying is he wants to put behind him all the violence that happened here over the past few weeks . \nIt 's not clear yet if this crowd here is quite of the same opinion -- Wolf . \nBLITZER : Nic Robertson , thanks very much . \nLet 's hope tourists start coming back in huge numbers to Egypt right now . \nThey certainly need that business . \nWhen we come back , some amazing photos , amazing photos from the revolution in Egypt . \nBLITZER : CNN 's Mary Snow has the story of one freelance photographer who got swept up in the drama of the revolution . \nMARY SNOW , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Wolf , unlike many photographers and journalists working for news organizations , Andrew Burton decided last week to get on a plane and travel to Egypt by himself . \nSNOW -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : It was February 2nd , the day pro-Mubarak supporters showed up in Tahrir square . \nEarly on , they did n't seem to mind Andrew Burton 's camera . \nANDREW BURTON , FREE PHOTOGRAPHER : They were very passionate about having their voices be heard . \nSNOW : The freelance photograph had just arrived in Cairo . \nHe says as the day wore on , he watched tensions escalate on TV and ventured back into the crowds . \nIt was this photograph that triggered an ugly turn . \nA man appeared to be writing over anti-Mubarak graffiti . \nAnd moments later , Burton , like many journalists that day , came under attack by pro-Mubarak supporters . \nIt was anti-Mubarak protesters who came to his aid . \nBURTON : Four or five men encircled me and kind of sheltered me while the mob kind of kicked and punched and hit us with sticks . \nSNOW : In the crowds , there were army tanks and Burton was taken to one . \nBURTON : I remember looking up and there was a soldier screaming , waving a pistol at the crowd . \nAnd , at that point , I was pulled into the tank by soldiers and kind of dumped head-first into this tank that was right outside Tahrir Square . \nI had some food with them . \nI think they probably made fun of me a bit . \nI was pretty shaken and scared at that point . \nSNOW -LRB- on camera -RRB- : What did they say to you ? \nBURTON : They asked me my name and what I was doing . \nI explained that I was a news photographer . \nSNOW -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Hours later , a soldier helped him get back to his hotel . \nTwo days later , Burton was back in Tahrir Square . \nThis protester heads into the crowd carrying a sling , as doctors stood ready to treat the injured . \nBut the intense clashes from earlier in the week were n't repeated . \nProtesters pray at the end of the day . \nBy Sunday , Burton notes a different mood . \nProtesters rest inside makeshift tents . \nChristians and Muslims side by side and families gather . \nBURTON : This is the father and the mother and the mom smiled at me with such a big smile and she said , this is a revolution baby . \nSNOW : And this anti-Mubarak protesters wears a sign that reads `` please go . '' \nSNOW : And these images are really underscoring how quickly the situation on the ground is changing from day to day and some of the risks that journalists take every day to tell this story -- Wolf . \nBLITZER : Mary Snow , thanks very much . \nAnd good luck to all the people of Egypt . \nThanks very much for watching . \nI 'm Wolf Blitzer . \nThe news continues next on CNN . \n"}
{"id": "249", "time": "2011-02-12", "text": "A woman wearing an Algerian flag holds a banner at a demonstration on February 12 in Bordeaux , southwestern France . \nTensions erupted in another restive North African nation as security forces in Algeria on Saturday clashed with anti-government protesters who chanted , `` Change the power . '' \nPolice detained about 100 protesters in the nation 's capital of Algiers , according to the Algerian League for Human Rights . \nThe league is one of the main opposition groups that organized the rallies -- unauthorized gatherings that came a day after embattled Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak stepped down . \n`` We are here once again to tell this government that we want an Algeria -LRB- that is -RRB- democratic , '' one protester told Reuters television . \n`` That 's why we are here today and we will always be , as this power is still here , we will be always here too .

'' \nThousands of Egyptians were in a still electric Tahrir Square Saturday , vowing to stay there until , as one protester put it , `` Egypt is ruled by a civil government , not a military one . '' \nA marble memorial was going up to remember those who died in the 18-day uprising . \nHuman Rights Watch has documented 302 deaths , a number the monitoring group called conservative . \nKheireldin said an `` unspoken plan '' had been reached between the military and a group of protest organizers to take down barricades and tents in Tahrir Square , even though some people wanted to hold out longer . \nTantawi , the head of the military 's supreme council , has a controversial reputation among the armed forces and had been derided by midlevel officers as `` Mubarak 's poodle '' for his fawning over the now-ousted president , according to U.S. diplomatic cables sent from the Cairo embassy in 2008 and published by WikiLeaks . \nThe Constitution allows for only two scenarios for a head of state to relinquish power . \nThe first stipulates that if the president has to step aside temporarily , the vice president steps into the top role . \nThat is what the regime briefly orchestrated Thursday . \nIf the office of the president is vacated or the president becomes permanently disabled , the Constitution states that the parliamentary speaker is to assume the role until new elections can be held . \nThose elections , in turn , must occur within 60 days . \nIn opting for a third way , which put all power in the hands of the military , the Mubarak regime in effect rendered the Constitution inoperable . \nShawee El-Sayed , an independent member of Egypt 's parliament and an expert on the country 's Constitution , said Mubarak 's move to transfer power to the military left Suleiman without an official role . \n`` The next step the council must -LRB- decide -RRB- is whether or not to validate the Constitution -- otherwise there will be a constitutional vacuum , '' he said . \nSaturday , Anan , the supreme council 's spokesman , said the current government would remain in place until a new one could be formed . \nState television reported , citing a judiciary source , that several high-ranking government officials , including the former prime minister and interior minister , were facing lawsuits and were barred from traveling out of the country . \nU.S. President Barack Obama , meanwhile , praised the Egyptian military for acting responsibly and said it now needs to help ensure a credible transition as it attempted to better gauge the unfolding situation . \nAdm. Mike Mullen , chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff , plans to visit key U.S. allies Israel and Jordan this weekend , a Pentagon official told CNN Saturday . \nUnder Secretary of State Bill Burns was already in Jordan meeting with King Abdullah , the State Department said . \nU.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates spoke with Tantawi on Saturday , the sixth phone conversation with the minister since the start of the Egypt uprising , a Defense Department spokesman said . \nIt was the first call since Mubarak stepped down . \nAmong other things , Egyptian authorities need to set about `` protecting the rights of Egypt 's citizens , lifting the emergency law , revising the Constitution and other laws to make this change irreversible , and laying out a clear path to elections that are fair and free , '' Obama said . \nBut some analysts were sounding the alarm over the takeover by the military , which has suddenly become accountable for the nation . \nAnalysts with Stratfor , a global intelligence company , said Egypt had essentially experienced a coup . \n`` Egypt is returning to the 1952 model of ruling the state via a council of army officers , '' the Stratfor statement said . \n`` The question now is to what extent the military elite will share power with its civilian counterparts . '' \nBut even as officials hash out the details of Egypt 's murky political future , its people power rippled throughout the region . \nIn the Yemeni capital , Sanaa , protesters chanted : `` Yesterday Tunisia , today Egypt , tomorrow Yemen will open the prison . '' \nAnd in restive Algeria , anti-government protesters chanted `` Change the power . '' \nSecurity forces clashed with the crowds . \nJordanian Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh told CNN that the country 's `` democraticization procession is well on track .

'' \nIn Milan , organizers estimated that 60,000 people gathered . \nProtests also took place outside Italy , including marches in Tokyo and Geneva . \nSunday 's demonstrations were the biggest anti-Berlusconi rallies since the most recent sex scandal broke in January , when Milan prosecutors said they were investigating whether the prime minister abused his power by helping an underaged woman , who he had allegedly paid for sex , get out of jail on a theft charge . \nBerlusconi has denied that he has ever paid anyone for sex . \nA string of sex scandals have dogged him . \nThe protests were organized by women 's groups and publicized by internet . \nThe turnout surprised the organizers , who did n't want the demonstrations to be political , though that 's what they became . \nOne woman who came with her family to the Milan rally told CNN that she was `` fed up with the way women are portrayed as objects in the Italian media . \nThe way that young girls are glorified by their looks and youth and then what ? \nI do n't want my daughter to grow up thinking that that is the only way to be ... that the only thing that matters is to be pretty and show off their legs . \n... We are more than that . '' \nIn Milan , demonstrators had banners that said , `` Stop the merchandising of women , '' and `` Berlusconi enough . \nYou bring us shame . '' \nMany of the speakers at the Milan rally criticized the way Berlusconi 's sex scandal made Italy look , his behavior towards women and his promoting ex-show girls to high government positions . \nProtesters said leaked evidence from the investigation show he has little respect for female dignity , the state-run ANSA news agency reported . \nWiretaps published in the media suggest he surrounded himself at parties at his home with starlets and other women hoping to use their looks to gain positions in politics or at Berlusconi 's Mediaset TV empire , ANSA reported . \nThe investigation began in December , after Berlusconi called police in May , urging them to release Karima El Mahrough , nicknamed Ruby , from jail , where she was being held on theft charges . \nProsecutors say the activity took place from February until May 2010 . \nBoth El Mahrough , now 18 , and Berlusconi have denied they ever had sex . \nEl Mahrough said she did not know Berlusconi well but that she did receive 7,000 euros -LRB- about $ 9,300 -RRB- from him the first time they met , on Valentine 's Day 2010 , because a friend told Berlusconi she needed help . \nThe young woman 's former roommate told investigators that El Mahrough confided to her that she did have a sexual relationship with the premier . \nBerlusconi 's party argued that he believed that Ruby was Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak 's niece and the phone call to the police station on her behalf was done to avoid a possible diplomatic crisis with Egypt . \nThe lower house of Italy 's Parliament voted against allowing Milan prosecutors to search property belonging to Berlusconi as part of the investigation . \n"}

{"id": "109", "time": "2011-02-13", "text": "Interview With Egypt 's Ambassador to United States ; Interview With Mohamed ElBaradei Aired February 13 , 2011 - 10:00 ET THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT . \nFAREED ZAKARIA , HOST : This is GPS , THE GLOBAL PUBLIC SQUARE . \nWelcome to all of you in the United States and around the world . \nI 'm Fareed Zakaria . \nI 'll give you my take on the extraordinary events in Egypt in just a minute . \nBut first , let tell you what 's coming up . \nEgyptian ambassador Sameh Shoukry was President Mubarak 's top representative in the U.S. Whom does he represent now ? \nAnd what is their plan to transition to democracy ? \nNext up , one of President Mubarak 's strongest opponents , Mohamed ElBaradei . \nWhat 's next for the opposition ? \nThen , the heart of the story , the Egyptian military . \nCan we expect them to make way for democracy after 50 years in power ? \nWe have a panel of experts . \nAnd finally , Jamie Dimon , the CEO of JPMorgan Chase . \nHe 's one of the few bankers to emerge from the financial crisis with his reputation enhanced . \nSome have even called him a hero . \nHe rarely talks in front of a camera , but you 'll hear him defend his profession and offer his take on the American economy . \nBut before we begin , let me give you my take on American foreign policy over these last few weeks . \nWe watched history being made last Friday as the dictatorship yielded to peaceful protests , but barely had that ended that we began our grand national tradition as Monday morning quarterbacks . \nThe administration has been behind the curve , people said . \nIt was divided , others report . \nIt should have embraced democracy much sooner and wholeheartedly . \nI think this is unfair . \nThe Obama administration faced a genuinely difficult balancing act . \nOn the one side was Hosni Mubarak 's regime , which have been a staunch American ally for 30 years . \nIt kept the peace with Israel , fought al Qaeda and other Islamic terrorists , blockaded Hamas , confronted Hezbollah -- in other words , it did everything Washington asked of it . \nOn the other hand was the vital need to support the people of Egypt in their morally justified and politically powerful quest for democracy . \nSo let 's look at what other presidents in such situations did . \nRonald Reagan faced a similar dilemma with the Philippine dictator , Ferdinand Marcos . \nMarcos ran a repressive and rapacious regime , but was staunchly anti-communist and an ally of America . \nUnrest in the Philippines began in August , 1983 , when Marcos ' goons assassinated an opposition leader . \nIt took Ronald Reagan three years to decide to push Marcos to leave office . \nBill Clinton faced a somewhat similar problem with Indonesia 's Suharto in 1997 , and for months all the administration did was issue calls for reform . \nFinally , a year and a half after the protests began , the Clinton admission acquiesced as the IMF pushed Suharto out of office . \nIt took Barack Obama one week to shift from a policy of supporting Mubarak to publicly calling for a transition to democracy . \nNow , maybe that 's an eternity in the world of cable news , but it 's pretty fast by my clock . \nIt 's easy for pundits to say that Washington should have pushed Mubarak out . \nFirst , that exaggerates Washington 's power . \nImagine if the president had asked Mubarak to leave and he had n't . \nSecondly , it does n't acknowledge the real tradeoff that Washington confronted , ensuring that other American allies did n't watch and decide that if they ever faced protest , Washington would throw them overboard at the drop of a hat . \nGiven all these pressures , I think that the Obama administration found a responsible way to junk a decades-old policy and get on the right side of history . \nLet 's get started with the show . \nZAKARIA : Joining me now , the Egyptian ambassador to the United States , Sameh Shoukry . \nAmbassador , thank you for joining us . \nSAMEH SHOUKRY , EGYPTIAN AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S. : Thank you for having me . \nZAKARIA : Ambassador , I 'm just looking at this fifth communique from the military council , the most recent one , and it seems to lay out a set of -- a set of guidelines that the constitution has been deactivated , parliament is dismissed , the council will run the country , the prime minister will stay in place until a new government is formed . \nIs that new government , as far as you know , going to be formed in some kind of coalition with the opposition groups or is it just another new government that will be formed with the existing people in the regime ? \nSHOUKRY : It will depend on the duration , whether the -- that new government will be formed after the parliamentary elections , or it might be formed before the parliamentary elections . \nAnd then , of course , it will depend on the outcome of those elections . \nSo I think it 's a little bit early to define when that might happen . \nBut , in any case , for the time being , the current government will run the day-to-day activities of governance . \nZAKARIA : And point eight in this nine-point communique is conducting elections , but it does not say over what period , nor does it say whether they will first be parliamentary or presidential elections . \nCan you -- can you shed light on that ? \nSHOUKRY : Well , the communique has just been issued so we need to look into it a little bit more carefully . \nI believe there was a timeframe of a six-month period for parliamentary elections to be held , if I 'm not mistaken , and within that timeframe I believe those are the -- that is the first priority . \nZAKARIA : Do you believe that this transitional government will be able to incorporate members of the opposition or is it going to have to be -- is it going to have to wait until the elections are held ? \nSHOUKRY : One would presume it would wait until the elections are held . \nIts current composition is basically a technocratic government to run the day to day affairs , to take care of the security void that has happened and to also address the issues related to the economy . \nThe Egyptian economy has suffered during this period of unrest and was suffering from the global recession with a rising unemployment rate . \nThat is -- those are the two priorities . \nZAKARIA : Tell me , Ambassador , as an Egyptian citizen , how do you react to last week 's events ? \nSHOUKRY : These are unprecedented events , certainly a matter of pride for all Egyptians , that the people have spoken in such an organized and peaceful manner , were able to -- to present their aspirations and to affect the -- effect change . \nThis is a matter of a small point in the history of Egypt in terms of its long civilization and it 's contribution to its region , but a very major event in terms of how Egyptians will forge their future . \nZAKARIA : Do you think that it will have a greater impact beyond Egypt ? \nSHOUKRY : Egypt has always been a trendsetter in -- in its region . \nThe region looks to it in many aspects that I 'm sure also in this regard many lessons will be learned . \nZAKARIA : Do you worry about some of the concerns that people raised , the Muslim Brotherhood using the ballot box to gain power and create some kind of an Islamic republic ? \nSHOUKRY : I believe that the people of Egypt will rely on their history , their previous experience , some -- the diverse nature of the composition of the population . \nEgypt has been a secular country . \nIt has a strong cultural background and will rely in forging ahead for the future on its experiences of the past . \nSo I believe that all varying political ideologies will be represented within a free and fair elections and it will be up to the people to decide who serves their best interest . \nZAKARIA : Now , for now you are maintaining the -- the treaty with Israel . \nThat has been made clear in both communiques , both recent communiques by the military . \nBut is it not fair to point out that if there were a new parliament and a new elected national assembly , it could , by democratic vote , aggregate this treaty ? \nSHOUKRY : Egypt is a country of institutions and has always made it a point to honor its legal commitments as a legal commitment and undertaken , one which -- one would expect , and rightfully so , that it would be upheld . \nThe peace treaty has benefited Egypt , has benefited the region in terms of creating stability and peace and giving an opportunity for Egypt to concentrate on its development . \nIt is in -- has been in the best interest of the Egyptian people . \nZAKARIA : What about the blockade of -- of Gaza ? \nThis is something that the Mubarak regime enforced quite vigorously . \nMany people in Egypt , I would venture to guess , a majority , feel otherwise , feel that Gaza should not be blockaded . \nWill that blockade be enforced now ? \nSHOUKRY : Egypt has never blockaded Gaza . \nThe blockade of Gaza was an Israeli policy . \nEgypt has only one crossing with the Gaza , which is a rougher crossing . \nIt 's a crossing for individuals and has been operated all through this last six months on a very regular basis to provide assistance , humanitarian assistance , when need arose to the people of Gaza and to also provide them freedom of access as individuals for educational purposes , medical treatment and general purposes of travel . \nSo the -- the status of our crossing is -- is operational and will I 'm sure continue to be so within the confines of its -- the legal terms under which the -- the crossing is a -- is manned . \nZAKARIA : Ambassador , thank you very much for joining us . \nZAKARIA : Back in a moment with a view from the other side , the opposition . \nZAKARIA : For the last two weeks , right here on this show , Egyptian Nobel Laureate Mohamed ElBaradei has been clear about one thing -- President Mubarak must go . \nNow that 's happened . \nWe decided to check in with Mohamed ElBaradei . \nThanks you for joining us . \nMOHAMED ELBARADEI , LEADING OPPOSITION FIGURE : Fareed , it 's always a pleasure to be with you . \nZAKARIA : You must be a happy man , Mohamed . \nELBARADEI : Oh , extremely happy man , Fareed . \nI ca n't even begin to describe my feeling and the feeling of every Egyptian here , that we got rid of this nightmare that has been there for 30 years . \nZAKARIA : Now what next ? \nA lot of people worry , Mohamed , that -- that you have an opposition that is divided , that the regime will -- will play to that and at the end of the day you will not really get what you want . \nELBARADEI : Fareed , I am frankly -- started to get worried , and people are becoming to be -- to be apprehensive because we thought that we would lay out the -- the roadmap for the transitional period . \nSo far we have done nothing of that . \nThey -- they have been talking to each other . \nThey have n't talked to the people . \nAnd , as you can see , people are still in the streets , and I was told today that by Friday , if we do not see a -- you know , the -- the roadmap , then people will go back to the street . \nI -- I understand that the army might need some time , but they need to lay out what -- what they are up to . \nWe need clearly a transitional period . \nWe need heavy participation by -- by the civilian with the -- with the army . \nIt could not be just the army running -- running the show . \nWe have n't even seen one of them on -- on the -- on television . \nIt 's just simply periodical statements by a spokesman for the army , very short and terse statement saying we are for legitimacy , we are for transition , but we need more than that , Fareed . \nZAKARIA : What about clarity , Mohamed , from the opposition ? \nWhat -- you know , can -- can you unify and present a set of demands ? \nAnd are you empowered to speak for the opposition ? \nELBARADEI : Well , I think -- I think the opposition , as you said , Fareed , clearly is fragmented after 60 years of oppression . \nBut -- but I think the opposition is all of one mind . \nWe need -- we need to , you know , co-manage the transition . \nWe need to -- to reach within a year a -- a country that is ready for a free and fair election and to elect a president and -- and a new parliament . \nOn all this , I think there is no disagreement , Fareed . \nSo we -- all we need -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- army to reach out to us right now . \nZAKARIA : And if by Friday there is n't a meaningful roadmap to -- for a transition , you would call for the protests to begin again ? \nELBARADEI : I think that 's what people are saying , and I think they 're making already preparations , the protests would go back into the street by Friday . \nBut -- but they need to come out of their headquarters and start talking to -- to the people and tell us what -- what is in store for us . \nZAKARIA : Mohamed ElBaradei , thank you very much . \nELBARADEI : Thank you , Fareed , for having me . \nZAKARIA : Back in a moment with a look at who holds all the power in Egypt -- the military . \nZAKARIA : You 're looking at Tahrir Square in Cairo . \nToday it 's filled with traffic instead of tens of thousands of protesters . \nBut while some things have changed , much else in Egypt remains the same . \nThe Egyptian military took power in a coup more than 50 years ago and it still has power today . \nSo what makes anyone think the generals will hand over power to democratic forces ? \nThat 's what I want to get to the bottom of . \nJoining me here in New York are Richard Haass and Steven Cook , both of the Council on Foreign Relations , Richard of course being the president . \nBoth have deep knowledge of the inner workings of the Egyptian military . \nAnd joining me from Sharm el-Sheikh , Egypt , Nic Robertson , CNN 's senior international correspondent . \nNic , what is your sense about the trust factor between the public and the military ? \nDoes the military have the public 's trust ? \nNIC ROBERTSON , CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : It does at the moment , Fareed , and we 've seen that so many times , most poignantly , perhaps , when the police fled from the streets , beaten back by the crowds on the 28th of January , that very violent Friday afternoon clash as the army arrived a couple of hours later . \nAnd since then we 've seen people shaking the hands of the soldiers , rushing up and kissing them after President Mubarak stepped down . \nSo -- so that -- that trust has n't been lost with the majority of the people . \nThat 's something that the army has managed to maintain . \nAnd , really , that 's golden for them at the moment . \nIt is in a way , there 's the squander . \nObviously there have been demands that there should be a speedier transition for them to move to a civilian administration , speedier than the six months that they 've announced . \nBut at the moment the majority do seem to support the military and they see them , unlike the police , as not being corrupt . \nThey are , after all , a conscript army . \nPeople describe them as being their sons , their brothers , their husbands . \nSo there 's a close connection with the people . \nSo , at the moment , that trust really does seem to exist , Fareed . \nZAKARIA : Always a pleasure , Nic . \nSteven , you -- you wrote a book in which you talked about the Egyptian military , and your pointed out they prefer to rule from the back . \nThey -- they do not like to actually have -- because in strange way that allows them to say inflation , unemployment , those are problems of the civilian government . \nThey just maintain power in the back . \nDoes this -- this must be an awkward moment for them . \nSTEVEN COOK , COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS : This is an incredibly awkward moment for the Egyptian military . \nThey went back into the barracks after the shattering defeat of June 1967 and have preferred to stay there with a brother officer in charge . \nNow , suddenly , after 40 years , they 've been thrust into direct politics , and it 's uncomfortable . \nAnd Egyptian politics are a difficult , difficult place to be . \nAnd it is -- remains an open question , how Field Marshal Tantawi and the people around him , none of whom are politicians . \nThey 're soldiers , and who prefer order , how they 're going to deal with the rough and tumble world of Egyptian politics ? \nZAKARIA : And they 've got huge equities at stake here . \nThe Egyptian military owns factories . \nThey operate toll roads . \nI mean , they have a kind of commanding position over the Egyptian economy . \nThey 're not going to want get -- to let go of this very easily . \nRICHARD HAASS , COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS : Of course not . \nIt 's a -- it 's a good life if you 're an Egyptian general with several stars on your shoulder . \nOn the other hand , the fact that they 've moved forward now , they suddenly increased the stakes for themselves . \nThey 've put themselves in quite a risky situation , and as you 're -- your report earlier made clear , now the really hard part begins . \nAs difficult as it was , if you will , to oust Mubarak , now the really tough start happens . \nThe pace of reform , the sequencing reform , constitutional change , elections for what -- when , political opening , all the difficult stuff . \nAnd the opposition , which agreed on getting rid of , if you will , modern day furrow -LRB- ph -RRB- , now the opposition begins to split . \nNot just one or two ways but in perhaps dozens of ways . \nSo all these people out there , all the jubilation , very quickly , we 're going to see it turn to frustration and disagreement . \nMy sense is the happiest days of this revolution are over . \nAnd it 's like , you study so much history , Fareed , very few revolutions end as positively as they begin and I would be surprised if this were an exception . \nZAKARIA : You talk about , in your book , Turkey and Algeria , and it struck me as a very interesting set of examples because in Turkey the generals ultimately do seek power . \nIn Algeria they have stubbornly clung to power . \nZAKARIA : In the Turkish cased , it was really because the European Union forced them to . \nThey did n't voluntarily -- ZAKARIA : -- go back into the -- COOK : Turkey has begun a transition to democracy not because of the generals but despite the generals . \nReally , the European Union created a whole range of constraints on the ability of the military to actually go in and intervene . \nThe Turkish generals were opposed to these kinds of reforms . \nThat 's why some of the discussion about a Turkish model for -- for Egypt seems misplaced . \nThe military in Egypt is going to have to deal with , as Richard said , an opposition that is splitting , an opposition that has different demands . \nIf you look at the military 's five statements thus far , they have n't tracked too far from when President Mubarak said in his three statements to the country . \nZAKARIA : Well , I want to talk about when we come back , what all of this means for the rest of the Arab world . \nAnd we 'll get to that in a moment with our great panel , looking at Egypt 's future . \nZAKARIA : And we 're back with Nic Robertson in Sharm el-Sheikh , Richard Haass and Steven Cook here with me in New York . \nRichard , protests in Algeria 's -- Yemen of course has had some instability , a very unusual thing where a group of tribal leaders sign a petition in Jordan . \nDo you think this is going to spill over ? \nHAASS : The Jordan one was the most surprising . \nMy general way of saying is I thought their traditional monarchies , the real monarchies were probably secure -- Jordan , Morocco , Saudi Arabia -- and we were looking more at the Yemens , the Algerias , where we thought this be the -- something that would trigger something . \nJordan is the most interesting because you do have the first signs of some disaffection -- crumbling is too big of a word , but some splintering of the Bedouin , if you will , non-Palestinian base of Jordan . \nThat 's the place to watch most . \nI still think that what will matter even more is what happens in Egypt . \nSo my way -- the reason I would n't answer your question yet , people are going to see what happens in Egypt . \nIf it goes badly , like in Iraq , when democracy , quote-unquote , `` broke out '' there after it was imposed , it was so messy , it led to such violence , it actually set back the cause . \nSo I think Egypt 's implications , its consequences , will depend very much on how it proceeds . \nDoes it go well ? \nDoes it go smoothly ? \nDoes Egypt six months from now or a year from now look better , more peaceful , more prosperous , more open , or does Egypt in some ways , does it -- is the military still there ? \nI think that will ultimately have the biggest effect . \nZAKARIA : Steven , I -- I kind of make a distinction in -- in the Arab world between the societies that use mass repression and the ones that use mass bribery . \nAnd I think of the ones that use mass bribery -- Saudi Arabia , the Gulf States , is more stable . \nIs that fair , do you think ? \nCOOK : Well , it seems to be the case that Saudi Arabia certainly has more resources than Mubarak ever had in order to buy political quiescence . \nBut you do see in one Gulf state , in Bahrain , a situation where there is a tremendous amount of disaffection with the ruling family and in fact they are now trying to buy political quiescence . \nThe King of Bahrain has authorized every Bahraini get $ 2,700 this week . \nSo what you 'll see throughout the region is this maneuvering in order to do the best they can to buy political quiescence , while like in Algeria , reinforcing the iron fist . \nHAASS : In Bahrain , like Syria , the places where very small minorities rule the country . \nHAASS : And those are two places perhaps to look at for just that reason . \nZAKARIA : When you look at U.S. foreign policy , what is the lesson you draw from all of this ? \nHAASS : So much of the debate has been on the tactics , but the administration got it right . \nI think you were fair . \nThis is awfully tough . \nTo me , what this does , though , Fareed , is it brings to the floor what in some ways is the biggest single question about American foreign policy , how central should democracy promotion be to what it is we do in the world ? \nAnd what you see now is this once again the split between the traditionalists who basically say we really ought to focus on those from what the Egypts of the world do beyond their borders to support through peace process , opposition to terrorism , as opposed to those who say , we really ought to focus on democracy . \nThat ought to be the centerpiece . \nAnd I would simply say for those who will take from this , the democracy ought to be at the center of our foreign policy , slow down . \nNot only do we not know what Egypt is going to look like in six months to a year , we do n't know what the foreign policy consequences of this . \nAnd whether it 's China or Russia or a lot of other non-democracies , the United States has an awful lot of equities out there that we simply ca n't afford to put on the back burner while we try to do perhaps the most difficult thing in foreign policy , which is to try to engineer the trajectory of another society . \nWe ought to have some humility about this . \nZAKARIA : The one caveat I would make of that , Richard , which however I would imagine you 'd agree to this , the reason in Egypt it was worth while to support democracy was supporting Mubarak and supporting these dictatorships had been breeding a very extreme violent religious opposition that was all directed at the United States , because they said you 're supporting the dictators whom we hate . \nSo there was a cost to the -- to the stability in Egypt , under the direct foreign policy cost to the U.S. . \nThey were killing Americans because of that . \nHAASS : Fair enough . \nAnd Egypt had become so polarized , the total absence of political reform is a dangerous thing . \nAnd what the lesson of this is not necessarily all or nothing , but reformism ought to be a part of American foreign policy . \nAnd that 's the challenge now in Egypt . \nWhat you do n't want to have there is what you might call Mubarakism , without Mubarak . \nSo the question is , can we bring about a gradualism in the direction of a more open society ? \nWe have to be very careful . \nIt may not look like the federalist papers . \nEgyptian , quote-unquote , `` democracy '' may frustrate people in the street . \nIt may frustrate people in the White House . \nWe 've got to be smart and we 've got to be careful about how far , how fast . \nAnd you look at Indonesia and you look at Nigeria , these places that run through it , it takes a while and the struggle to get power from the military takes a while , but over time if you have a democratic leader like the parliament , that gives them a platform from which they get things as well . \nNic , I want to ask you about this question of America . \nDoes America figure in the debate any more in Egypt ? \nAre they looking to Washington or -- and do they think Obama did enough ? \nROBERTSON : Well , certainly we 've heard from the army saying that they 're going to provide continuity in terms of their international policies and internal policies as well . \nSo , obviously , part of that international continuity must involve the United States . \nBut there are probably two principle sensitivities here . \nOne is how any U.S. involvement is manifested with Egypt as far as it 's viewed in the region , particularly from the United States principle allies here , Saudi Arabia and Jordan , how will they view how the United States handles the situation . \nAnd perhaps more critically for the army and for the United States is how it 's perceived here in Egypt . \nBecause during the demonstrations , particularly in the early days , the refrain that we continue to hear many , many days from the protesters was President Obama is not supporting us . \nHe 's staying with the side of President Mubarak , even as President Obama was shifting his position . \nSo there is a perception that the United States did n't move fast enough by some of the protesters . \nThere will also be a perception among President Mubarak supporters who were many who will say that the United States should n't have been involved and foreign powers influence what happened here . \nUndoubtedly , that may be an over reading and a misreading of the situation . \nBut these are the sensitivities . \nSo however the United States plays its hand with the army and in Egypt right now , it will -- it will necessarily need to be , I would say , cautious and do it behind the scenes . \nBecause there will be many sensitivities about how it is perceived to be maneuvering . \nEveryone knows the United States relationship with Egypt is critical in the region and people will be aiming to score points off of it and pull it apart in any way they can , Fareed . \nZAKARIA : Nic , thank you very much . \nAnd that 's all the time we have for our panel . \nRichard Haass , Steven Cook , Nic Robertson . \nWe will be right back with Jamie Dimon , America 's top banker by some people 's estimation . \nJAMIE DIMON , CHAIRMAN AND CEO , JPMORGAN CHASE : Not all bankers are the same . \nAnd I just think this constant refrain -- bankers , bankers , bankers , it 's just -- it just does n't -- it 's really an unproductive and unfair way of treating people . \nZAKARIA : At the recent World Economic Forum in Davos , I presided over a panel of some of the world 's top businessmen . \nThey were all extremely thoughtful , but I was most taken by what Jamie Dimon said . \nHe 's , of course , the Chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase . \nDimon and his company emerged unscathed from the financial crisis , in fact , with both their reputations enhanced . \nIf you want to hear what Jaime Dimon had to say about the state of the U.S. economy , the job problem , Europe and why he thinks he and his fellow bankers get a bad rap . \n-LRB- BEGIN VIDEOTAPE -RRB- ZAKARIA : There is still , as you know , if you look at polls -- polls in the United States , still a widespread feeling in the United States that the taxpayers bailed out the banks and the banks are not helping the taxpayers , they 're paying themselves big bonuses , but that lending has actually contracted in aggregate . \nYou may be up over the last year , but overall , if you look at the amount of lending , which is $ 7 trillion , you 're still at about 2005 levels . \nWhat do you say to the average American taxpayer who says , guys , we bailed you out , now -- now give us , you know , do something in return ? \nIn the United States of America , only one-third of credit is provided by banks . \nBank lending actually went up after Lehman Brothers failed , not down . \nIt 's a huge misconception . \nTwo - thirds of credit is provided by individuals , corporations , pension plans , you know , et cetera . \nThe huge reduction in credit supplied was the credit supplied in directly to the marketplace . \nIn fact , if you go to any place around the world , you ask people , did you do something more conservative with your money after Lehman went down ? \nWhich everyone says , yes . \nI would say , well , you caused the crisis . \nIt 's perfectly legitimate as an individual protecting yourself . \nAnd JPMorgan last year lent or financed $ 1.4 trillion for corporations , individual around the world , up pretty substantially from the year before and I believe substantially from the year before that . \nMost banks are lending quite a bit . \nBut remember , some of them are gone . \nThe ones who are gone are no longer lending . \nSo obviously there 's been a reduction . \nSo you may talk to people saying , I ca n't get money and they be that standards have loosened up in the last year , but they have not -- they have not tightened up . \nSo banks are -- we are lending aggressively into corporates , to middle market , small business lending up 30 percent . \nThere is , if you talk to most , there 's a demand issue . \nA lot of them do n't need the money because they 're not -- because they 're not building inventory , not building plans , they 're not building - You know , a lot of these people have tons of cash . \nThey 're not -- they do n't need to call up their banks because they 've got plenty of money right now . \nSo - ZAKARIA : Let me ask you about one more consequence of the crisis , if I may , which is - DIMON : There 's a huge misconception , in which not all banks needed that T.A.R.P. . \nYou know , not all banks would have failed . \nAnd right here , a lot of policy makers and regulation makers -- that one assumption drive so much the anger that they would have failed . \nI can tell you a lot of banks were stabilizing this problem . \nJPMorgan bought Bear Stearns because the United States government asked us to . \nWe bought -- we bought not because we wanted to . \nWells Fargo bought Wachovia . \nHSBC was -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- . \nAnd I can go bank after bank who 's a stabilizing force , trying to make up for the fact that there are other failures . \nSo we -- we lump everyone together like -- and I think it is a terrible thing to do . \nI do n't lump all media together . \nThere 's good and there 's bad . \nThere 's irresponsible and ignorant and there are really smart media . \nWell , not all bankers are the same . \nAnd I just think this constant refrain -- bankers , bankers , bankers , it 's just -- it just does n't -- it 's really an unproductive and unfair way of treating people . \nAnd I just think people should stop doing that . \nI think that denigrates everything . \nNot all companies are the same , not all CEOs are the same , not all media is the same . \nAnd so I -- we try to do the best we can every day . \nZAKARIA : Let me ask you about another consequence of this -- of this crisis . \nIt has been to concentrate assets among the top banks . \nJPMorgan , Citigroup , Bank of America now represent 30 percent of all assets . \nYou have about $ 2 trillion in deposit . \nIt strikes me that the net effect of the -- of what has happened , is you 're not too big to fail , you 're way too big to fail . \nSo it 's 30 percent of all deposits in America . \nAmerica is far less concentrated than Europe , Asia , Canada , Australia , France , U.K. , Italy , I mean , way less concentrated . \nThere are reasons for -- it kind of just scale -LRB- ph -RRB- , stuff like that . \nI wish -- I believe that when we start talking about resolution authority , that we should , the governments , the regulation should be able to take down a JPMorgan in a way that does n't damage citizens of the world . \nI also think the banks should pay for that . \nLike in the FDIC , when banks fail , the FDIC takes them over and kind of liquidates them and the rest of the banks pay for that . \nWe 're going to pay $ 5 billion , the FDIC , if a failure of other banks . \nI -- instead of calling it resolution , I think we should have called it minimally damaging bankruptcy for big dumb banks . \nTake them down , wipe them out , full bankruptcy , unsecured creditors pay . \nAnd that 's -- that 's what they 're trying to get to , which is a little complex . \nIt can be done . \nThat 's what the FDIC did with big banks for many years . \nNow we 've become global . \nSo I understand , if you 're a regulator , you need to say , OK , what can I do in the U.K. ? \nWhat can I do in France ? \nCan I protect myself ? \nThe answer is you can . \nIt 's a little complicated , but it can be done and that 's the better way to do it . \nLet these companies fail . \nPut them in a position they can all fail and the world is fine . \nZAKARIA : Could JPMorgan fail without systemic risk in the United States today ? \nIf it 's set up properly , the answer is yes . \nSo -- and the other thing I remembered , Lehman -- if the Lehman Brothers had failed in 2000 -- there 's the thing about complex systems . \nIf Lehman Brothers have failed in 2005 , I do n't think it would have caused this crisis . \nI guess it was cumulative trauma after -- you had problems in Germany , you had problems in Britain , you had problems in the United States , and the United States was the epicenter . \nI 'm not going to deny that . \nBut it was -- AIG , WaMu , mortgage brokers and it was around the world . \nAnd so things would be very different if -- if they were set up so that they could be handled . \nLehman Brothers had $ 200 billion of unsecured debt . \nIf at the point of failure that unsecured debt had been turned into equity , Lehman would have 200 billion of equity and 600 billion of assets and it would have been fine . \nZAKARIA : Larry Summers on my program said financial industry fought this reform tooth and nail . \nThey 've spent a million dollars on each congressman , four lobbyists for every congressmen . \nIs this financial reform change things ? \nDIMON : You know , I love Larry . \nA ridiculous statement , OK ? \nFirst of all -- first of all , it 's a free -- I remind these people all the time that 's it 's a in a democracy you have the right to petition your government . \nIt 's in the number one amendment in the U.S. Bill of Rights . \nMost of that lobbyists are own people . \nWhen I go to Washington , it counts as lobbying time and they have to add it up and , you know , whatever -- how they would calculate and stuff like that . \nWe did n't fight financial reform , OK ? \nWe wanted resolution authority . \nWe thought there should be oversight committees . \nWe thought -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- should go to clearing houses . \nWe thought there should be better consumer protection . \nWe fought the parts of the reform we thought were irrational . \nYou know , it 's not like you were for or against reform . \nThere 's a -- I complete -- we completely acknowledge -LRB- ph -RRB- the need for massive reform after what happened . \nBut , you know , some of the stuff that got done which is not rational . \nSo we at first to say we 're supposed to bend down and accept it because we 're a bank , I say that 's not fair . \nSo -- and Larry knows the detail too . \nHe knows some of these things . \nThat he did n't support all of the reform . \nIf he would stand up here , he would agree with me , there are a lot of things that -- that had nothing to do with him , which is , you know , people in Congress coming up with their own ideas and what would make sense . \nZAKARIA : All right . \nJamie Dimon 's proposed resolution authority , for those of you who did n't catch it is the MDBBDB , minimally damaging bankruptcy for big dumb banks . \nSomehow I feel , Jamie , that you 're a great banker , but you have n't come up with a good acronym for legislation . \nZAKARIA : Back in a moment . \nWhat keeps Jamie Dimon up at night ? \n-LRB- COMMERCIAL BREAK -RRB- ZAKARIA : And we 're back with more from Jamie Dimon , the CEO of JPMorgan Chase , perhaps America 's top banker . \nI asked him about what keeps him up at night ? \nWhat 's the next crisis to worry about ? \nZAKARIA : Jamie , when you look out at -- at the world , do you worry about the easy money and the low cost of capital and what it can do ? \nThe reason I ask this is , of course , many people believe we got into the problems we did in the financial crisis because there was too much easy money , the cost of capital had collapsed . \nIt was too easy to get loans , too easy to -- to get leverage and people are borrowing too much . \nBanks were giving too much credit . \nNow , the solution to this problem has been easy money , allowing people to take lots of debt , encouraging people to take mortgages . \nIn other words , the solution is the very set of factors which were supposed to have caused the problem . \nIs this a danger ? \nDIMON : So I do think it 's a danger , but to put in a little historical context , that we 've had -- I think when you plan for risk at all , you 've got to assume there are going to be issues you do n't always understand . \nAnd you do n't always know what the path is going to take . \nIn fact , the problem that low interest rates caused last time may not be the problem it causes this time . \nAnd so I think wise people prepare for tough times . \nIt does not mean that mankind should accept them . \nMy guess is 500 years from now , we 'll be looking back at how we manage economies a little bit like we look at medicine today like how they need to bleed people when they had certain problems . \nWe are -- we are very -- we 're not particularly good at it . \nAnd I think we 're still learning enormous lessons . \nAnd I think the actual risk from some of it is lower . \nCorporations from low rates and leverages way down , hedge funds are less leveraged , private equities are less leveraged , banks were less leveraged and corporations have a lot of money . \nSo I think the leverage issue has been reduced and it 's kind of -- you look , it 's gone to the -- it 's gone to the governments who now have too much kind of leverage which you see in this sovereign crisis . \nSo I do think it did cause part of the problems from last time , but only because there was a mound of other problems waiting to be exposed . \nYou know , from bad mortgage underwriting to certain bad accounting , through gaps in the regulatory system . \nSome of those things are not there today . \nSo I think it 's very different if it happens . \nZAKARIA : What is the danger from municipal default by a state , California , New Jersey or a locality , and if I can add to that , this one for the complexity ? \nYou have a large number of people who come into Congress from the Tea Party who say the one thing they 're sure of , there are no more bailouts . \nSo is there -- you know , what people would call tail risks , is there some risk here that you have pressure on some U.S. state or city and the federal government actually does n't come through because of this anti-bailout atmosphere in Congress ? \nSo , completely separate the states from municipalities . \nStates have a lot of wherewithal , when you talk about this huge deficit , the deficit in California is equal to one percent of the GDP in California , so if they raise taxes one percent , they could pay their deficit . \nAnd that 's true for some of the other states and they have the wherewithal . \nThere are 14,000 municipalities . \nAnd you are unfortunately going to see some bankruptcies . \nThe 14,000 go from very small to obviously some very large . \nAnd it will be an issue for some . \nAnd they have built up these -- these obligations , pensions , kind of snuck up on people because a lot of these -- like governments , you know , when like corporations used to until they change accounting , you give things away today , they do n't cost until later and you have to write -- you have to put it in the books today . \nSo I think you 'll see some municipalities use bankruptcy court to try to renegotiate some of those contracts . \nBut $ 3 trillion of total state and municipality debt is -- with all of the -- and some a fraction of the problems . \nAnd I do n't think it 's going to cause a systemic issue in the United States . \nIt 'll be in the headlines , you 'll see kind of some to-ing and fro-ing and the total deficit of all states and all municipalities is 200 billion , relative to the total U.S. deficit of 1.5 trillion . \nSo that is really kind of small relative to that . \nIt 's a concern . \nIt 's going to have to be fixed . \nI just do n't think it 's going to stop growth in 2011 or 2012 . \nIt 's just a negative factor overlying the American system . \nCan we close by getting one thought -- and what is the thing that worries you the most ? \nAnd if you can keep it too one sentence , just , you know , what is the shock to the system that you 're most worried about ? \nWhat keeps you up at night ? \nDIMON : So I 'm going to use the word `` bad policy '' , but before I use that word , I want to say that I think the governments of the world did a tremendous amount of things that saved it from getting far worse . \nBut if you read a lot of economic history , and particularly this book , I know -- I know Ken Rogoff is here . \nYou know , Reinhart and Rogoff wrote a book `` This Time is Different '' , about eight major crises , that financial crises take a long time getting out of . \n, but it 's not a given that it has to take place . \nVery often it take a long time getting out of this , because policies in the middle of the crises , not from -- sometimes for venal purposes but often just a lack of knowledge and lack of understanding actually make it worse . \nAnd I would love to get people back to work , employed and growing . \nI think it 's the most important thing that we have to do . \nAnd , you know , I know there are unknown -- and I agree with you , but to my attitude , geopolitics , I do n't know -- it 's always there and it will always going to hit us somewhere where we least expect it , so we 've got to be prepared for those . \nZAKARIA : That was Jamie Dimon . \nBack with my final thoughts on Egypt in just a moment . \nZAKARIA : Before we go , I want to recommend a book , this week it 's George W. Bush 's memoir , `` Decision Points . '' \nI read it recently on a plane . \nI have to say it 's surprisingly well written and frank . \nYou will not agree with all of his decisions . \nYou might not think he 's super smart , but he comes across as an agreeable frank human being and I found it a good read . \nNews moves fast and we 've already moved past that heady evening in Cairo just two days ago when a dictatorship was toppled by people power . \nWe moved on to discussing the problems that remain , the military in power , the divided -- divided oppositions , the weak economy , all totally valid concerns . \nBut can we take a moment to marvel at the courage and the discipline of those crowds in Egypt , those people who risked their lives and created history . \nIn Shakespeare 's `` Henry V , '' the young king tells the crowd on the eve of the Battle of Agincourt that they would remember being on that battle field on that day , St. Crispin 's Day . \nFor the rest of their lives , that they would tell their children they were there , that they would show off the wounds they suffered that day . \n`` People now in bed , '' Henry V said , `` would feel themselves cursed that they were not hereupon St Crispin 's Day .

{"id": "32", "time": "2011-02-13", "text": "Interview With Lindsey Graham ; Interview With Jacob Lew Aired February 13 , 2011 - 09:00 ET THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT . \nCANDY CROWLEY , HOST : It took 18 days to remove a dictator of 30 years . \nEgypt is a different place now , but in the aftermath of euphoria the question is the same -- what next for Egyptians , for the region and the world , for the U.S. ? \nThe first definition of revolution in the dictionary reads an overthrow or repudiation and the thorough replacement of an established government or political system . \nEgypt 's revolution is just getting started . \nAfter the dictator , we 'll talk with our reporters about Egypt under military rule , Washington 's next moves with Republican Lindsey Graham from the Senate Armed Services Committee , and the impact on the region with former U.N. Ambassador John Negroponte and former Ambassador to Egypt Edward Walker . \nThen the administration 's next challenge -- budget cutting . \nWe are joined by the head of the Office of Management and Budget Jacob Lew . \nI 'm Candy Crowley and this is `` State of the Union . '' \nSome breaking news out of Egypt , a military spokesman has just read an announcement with significant developments . \nThe Egyptian military has suspended the constitution and the transition government will run the country for six months or until elections of the parliament . \nWe have two correspondents standing by : Ivan Watson in Cairo and Nic Robertson who had driven to Sharm el-Sheikh , where former President Mubarak is reported to be . \nFirst to you Ivan , can you help translate to us whether you think this sort of action , suspending the constitution , putting a time limit it would seem , on how long the military will stay in control , is that enough to empty the square for weeks to come ? \nWATSON : The square is mostly empty right now , Candy . \nThe military swept in yesterday and continued today trying to push protesters out , tear down a lot of tents in some cases despite objections from some of the more die-hard demonstrators who have said they do not want to leave until they are 100 % confident all demands are met . \nI was down there an hour or two ago and actually saw actually the Red Beret military police detaining some demonstrators and small scuffles breaking out . \nThis move is pretty dramatic , because there 's been a question in the air , who is in charge . \nThe Prime Minister Ahmed Shafik who you spoke to last week on the phone just made an announcement , but there was no warning that the military was going to announce such sweeping changes , assuming so much responsibility of the state saying that it was going to dissolve parliament , suspend the constitution , be the representative of Egypt both domestically and internationally and oversee the process of trying to set up the next presidential and parliamentary elections . \nWhen it comes to the parliament -- dissolving the parliament , I think the military will have the support of much of the protest movement because the parliament has very little credibility here after the very troubled and widely perceived as rigged election of last November and December -- Candy . \nCROWLEY : I may have put the question inartfully . \nWhat I 'm trying to get as is do you think the moves by the military will be satisfactory to protesters and they will , in fact , stay out of the square , that this is what they wanted , this puts them on the road to where they want to go . \nAre these good things ? \nWATSON : I think for the time being many of the demonstrators and protesters are supporting the military and have been working hand in glove in the square , for example , sweeping up debris , repainting the curbs there and you still have hordes of people coming to take photos with the military . \nThe military is riding high now . \nBut there are from some segments of this really historic opposition movement , this protest movement , are some suspicions and there are some doubts . \nBut I think it 's safe to say that the majority of them are kind of in a wait and see mode . \nIt is important to note outside the square we are seeing protests cropping up around some of the main banks , for example , people demanding higher wages , angry at their bosses , the chairman of those companies arguing that the salaries there are too high . \nAnd it is likely we 'll continue to see this bubbling ferment of discontent with some of the older institutions in this country that still may be run by people who were very close to the Mubarak regime . \nThe expectations have been raised very high . \nAnd as one demonstrator told me today in the square , we have had a revolution . \nMubarak is gone now but we still have the same 80 million problems in this country , meaning the entire population of Egypt . \nCROWLEY : Let me turn now to our Nic Robertson . \nNic , I know you drove to Sharm el-Sheikh , so you were able some of the countryside . \nWhat we have seen for 18 days has been really Tahrir Square and parts of Cairo . \nIs it any different ? \nAs you traveled did anything catch your attention ? \nROBERTSON : I think there is a lot of military presence controlling the main checkpoints that go under the tunnel under the Suez Canal -- obviously the Suez Canal is strategically vital to the world . \nEgypt knows that , the army knows that , and they have put in , from what we can see , very tough and stringent checks either side of that tunnel to make sure that everyone that goes through is identified and has their bags searched . \nIt does mean there are long delays . \nBut it does mean it would be hard for terrorists to strike underneath the tunnel and damage this vital part of the global transport network or the shipping network . \nWe also saw driving across the desert , in the Sinai Desert , where it 's incredibly remote , Bedouin farmers , more goats and sheep at checkpoints than policemen , but spray painted on the side in the middle of the desert was `` go Mubarak . '' \nAnd I think that really gives you an indication that it was n't just what we were seeing in Tahrir Square but it was across the country that people had the same spirit and feeling that it was time for President Mubarak to step down , Candy . \nCROWLEY : Nic , tell me about Mubarak . \nAre we certain he is in his residence in Sharm el-Sheikh ? \nAnd is it a given that he can , as he once expressed interest in living out his days in Egypt . \nAre Egyptians likely to let him live on in peace there ? \nROBERTSON : He is -- if you look over my shoulder here , you will see a low white wall some distance behind me there . \nThat is the wall of his presidential compound . \nIt 's incredibly tightly guarded at the moment . \nTo get on the road that drives down there , there are police checkpoints , the police have automatic weapons . \nThere are plain clothes security personnel who ask you searching questions about who you are , what you do , where you 're going to get down the road that approaches that door . \nAnd I can certainly tell you that there are very heavy security installations around and at the moment the government here seems to be providing a high level of security for President Mubarak at this time . \nIt 's very close to us here , Candy . \nCROWLEY : Nic Robertson in Sharm el-Sheikh , Ivan Watson in Cairo , a salute to both of you . \nJust such great work . \nWe appreciate your time . \nUp next , Republican Senator Lindsay Graham on how the U.S. should handle the revolution in Egypt . \nCROWLEY : Joining me now from Greenville , South Carolina , Republican Senator Lindsey Graham . \nSenator , thank you . \nI 'm not sure if you got to hear the breaking news at the top of the show , but essentially the military council has said that they have suspended the constitution and that they will be conducting things for the next six months or until there are elections . \nIs that an OK timeframe , do you think , as far as the way the U.S. is looking at it ? \nGRAHAM : Well , I think from our national security interests , this election in Egypt is going to define Egypt in the region for decades . \nAnd Mr. ElBaradei said it could take up to a year to get democratic institutions in place . \nJust think what they have to do going forward . \nThere really is no independent judiciary , there are no political parties . \nThe constitution has been used basically to outlaw political parties . \nSo I 'm looking for a free , fair , transparent election that would get the full flavor of Egypt . \nAnd a rushed election could help an organization like the Muslim Brotherhood , so my advice to the Egyptian people is , take your time , reach out to the world at large . \nA lot of people want to help you . \nAnd I 'm not so sure you can do all the things you need to do between now and September to have an election that reflects the full will of the Egyptian people and to create democratic capacity . \nBut that will be up to the Egyptian people . \nCROWLEY : I was talking to an administration official yesterday who talked about being -- there being two different clocks in Egypt . \nAnd one of them goes slowly , because it says you are building a democracy from the ground up here . \nThat is not easy to do . \nWe saw that in Iraq under entirely different circumstances , but nonetheless , it takes time when every institution needs to be redone . \nCROWLEY : And then there is that other clock , that is the impatience that you saw in the square , the impatience that you feel from young people and from their parents . \nAnd so you have to find that sweet spot , do you not , between going too slowly to satisfy protesters who could just as easily show back up in the square , could they not ? \nGRAHAM : You know , that is a very good analysis . \nAnd I think your network has done an outstanding job of informing the American people what 's going on in Egypt . \nYes , where is that sweet spot ? \nThere will be a desire to look backward , to hold Mubarak accountable . \nHow much money did he steal from the Egyptian people ? \nShould he and those around him go to jail for abusing the Egyptian people ? \nThat 's going to create friction with the army , because the army has been very close to Mubarak institutions , the Mubarak presidency . \nSo as young people , the Muslim Brotherhood talk about looking backward , that may create some friction going forward . \nWe know what the people are against in Egypt . \nWe do n't yet know what they are for , so there is a lot of friction when it comes to capacity building . \nYou know , how much can you get up and running before September to make the election really meaningful ? \nSo I would err on the time of going slow , building capacity , and as the desire to look back grows -- which it will , to hold people accountable -- that will create friction among the army because a lot of the generals in this army have lived pretty well during the Mubarak era . \nAnd I do n't know how much they are going to be into letting people go back and hold him accountable . \nCROWLEY : Well , and yet these are also the people who the U.S. has mainly been dealing with . \nCROWLEY : Certainly during the last 18 days , and obviously over the course of the last three decades . \nWhen you look at the idea of Egypt recreating itself , what do you worry about most ? \nBecause I have seen people say , I worry about the U.S. intelligence gathering . \nEgypt has been so helpful , particularly when it comes to Al Qaida and Iran , what 's going on in Gaza . \nI have had other people say , you know , this was the door to other Arab countries . \nWhat worries you most that the U.S. will lose or might lose ? \nGRAHAM : Well , as we develop a new -- if we can pull this off , if the Egyptian people can create a democracy in the heart of the Arab world , it will be a more significant contribution to civilization than the great pyramids . \nIt really will have a long-lasting effect . \nI worry that we 'll rush to an election where the Muslim Brotherhood , who is the most organized but does n't represent the true will of the Egyptian people , will have a disproportionate effect . \nI worry about the army . \nWill the army hold together ? \nWill the young officers accept the rule of the senior people ? \nWill the army really subordinate itself to civilian control as this new democracy unfolds ? \nYou talked about intelligence . \nI worry about our own intelligence services understanding what the heck is going on . \nWhen the DNI of the United States says the Muslim Brotherhood is mostly a secular organization , that sent chills up my spine . \nIt makes me wonder , do we really know what 's going on in Iran ? \nAnd if Iran gets a nuclear weapon , all hell breaks loose in the Mideast . \nSo I worry about what happens in the next six months to a year in Egypt affecting our relationship with Saudi Arabia , with Jordan and Israel . \nNow is the time to stand by Israel without equivocation and help the people in Egypt to form a democracy . \nBut at the end of the day the order , the task they have chosen will be very difficult but doable . \nCROWLEY : And it could backfire . \nGRAHAM : Oh , let me tell you , you 've got Jordan and Saudi Arabia are thinking we have thrown over our friend in Egypt . \nWell , Mubarak was a good ally . \nHe did bring a calming influence . \nThe army has reaffirmed the peace treaty with Israel . \nBut at the end of the day , people in Jordan and Egypt -- excuse me , Saudi Arabia , need to get the message from Tunisia and Egypt . \nAnd that is that you 've got to give your people more say , a larger voice in society . \nThis could be a good thing for the region or it could all fall apart . \nIf it falls apart in Egypt , who knows where it ends , what kind of forces does it unleash in the Mideast . \nSo you get one chance to get this right . \nTo the protesters , I know you have had a tremendous effect on the future of Egypt in the last 18 days . \nMy advice would be to go slow , form political parties , take that energy that led to bringing this regime down and chart a brighter future that is based on religious tolerance and secular democracy . \nAnd those things are not certain yet , by any means . \nCROWLEY : Senator , while Egypt was busy reformulating itself , CPAC , which is the , as you well know , a collection of conservative groups , was holding a meeting in Washington , talking about spending cuts and the like . \nBut they also had a straw poll that I just wanted to show you the results of over the weekend . \nRon Paul came in first with 30 percent . \nMitt Romney next with 23 percent . \nAnd then down the line , Gary Johnson , Chris Christie and Newt Gingrich . \nThere were others , obviously a lot of others that I 'm sure you know personally that are thinking of running for president . \nIs there anybody on this list that you look at and think , I could go with this guy ? \nGRAHAM : Well , you know , at the end of the day , I 'm looking for the most conservative person who is electable . \nAnd that person is yet to emerge . \nMitt Romney is probably the frontrunner among traditional candidates . \nRon Paul is a well organized , has a lot of energy behind his ideas . \nBut whether or not he could win a general election , I think , is a big if . \nWe have got a tall task as Republicans . \nWe 're going to have to win independent voters . \nThey are very much looking at the Republican Party anew . \nWe are getting a second chance with the American electorate . \nWe did well in 2010 . \nAnd I think President Obama is beatable , but we have got to nominate someone that can win over independent voters , who do want smaller government and less spending , but understand there is a role for government . \nSo over the next few months , we 'll see who can pick that mantle up and run with it , the most electable conservative . \nNo one quite knows yet . \nCROWLEY : Tis the season . \nThank you so much , Senator Lindsey Graham . \nWe really appreciate your time . \nCROWLEY : Up next , we 'll get perspective on how the events in Egypt will shape the Middle East with two former ambassadors . \nCROWLEY : Joining me now here in Washington , Edward Walker , former U.S. Ambassador to Egypt and Israel during the Clinton administration ; John Negroponte , former U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. , former deputy Secretary of State under George Bush . \nSo thank you all this is getting familiar here . \nAnd I 'm so glad we have had you to walk us through what 's going on . \nThe latest is the military communique saying we are going to suspend the constitution and we will be running things for six months or until elections . \nIs it a good thing , a bad thing ? \nWALKER : It 's a necessary thing . \nBecause you ca n't rebuild until you get rid of the old . \nIf you look through the constitution it 's virtually impossible to think how you would reform it to meet demands of the Egyptian people . \nAnd so taking it off the table for now and reconstructing it , particularly those elements related to elections and who can run , it 's critically important for the next step . \nSo this is a positive step forward . \nCROWLEY : Seems to me September sounds kind of early to recreate a democracy . \nIs there , how long do you think the military has to show to the protesters and the people of Egypt that they are on the path that the protesters want them on ? \nNEGROPONTE : I think September is a short period of time . \nI think it 's a question of what the trend is , how much progress is being made . \nI do n't think they have to feel bound by a strict deadline . \nI think the important thing is that they engender enough confidence with the Egyptian people that the Egyptian people think that the military wants the same outcome as they do and that the military just is n't acting according to some hidden agenda of its own . \nI think that 's the important point . \nCROWLEY : One of the things obviously that fueled this -- yes , it was Tunisia , an example of something that could be done by a single man . \nYes , this was a brutal dictator that they wanted to get rid of . \nBut unemployment , poverty , corruption was really the fuel to this . \nI mean , that 's what brought everybody -- I kept looking at those people in the square thinking , they are going to be disappointed , because the things that really bother them are going to take years . \nWALKER : It 's going to take years to get the economy really rolling again . \nThey have taken a hit , but it 's not that big a hit . \nPeople talk about tourism disappearing . \nWell , after the Japanese attack in Luxor it only took I think three months before the tourism industry was back to where it was before . \nEgypt has amazing resilience and recovery capacity . \nBut they are going to have to change the rules of the game so you do n't have crony capitalism , you do n't have people ripping off the state . \nThey have got to really come clean on the corruption side . \nCROWLEY : Do you think that there is a way to keep Egyptians day to day happy , content until you can put together democracy ? \nI think that 's the big fear , is it not ? \nNEGROPONTE : I agree about the risk of disappointment and that 's a fairly high risk . \nAnd it certainly would n't be the first time that that has happened , but it 's also an opportunity . \nThere really is an opportunity here to reinvigorate the economy . \nIt may be an opportunity for some other Arab countries like the Gulf States and Saudi Arabia to come forward with some kind of rehabilitation package for Egypt . \nEgypt is poised actually , has been poised for the last few years for dramatic economic growth : its good position towards Europe , its large population , its intelligent , well-educated people . \nSo -- I mean , there are opportunities out there if the country can just calm down enough and get its act together . \nCROWLEY : Who 's running the place ? \nI realize it 's a military council , but does n't there have to be one person somewhere that goes , yes , no , go this way ? \nWALKER : Well , Field Marshall Tantawi is the man who has assumed the role of saying yes\\/no , but he 's not going to operate on a unilateral basis . \nHe 's got to reach out both to his council , the supreme council . \nThey are going to have to reach out to more people than that , they 're going to have to bring in civilians very quickly to keep some kind of semblance of movement for the people . \nAnd , you know , Field Marshal is a very cautious , conservative guy . \nBut in my talks to him before , he 's never shown any indication of wanting to be the top boss . \nCROWLEY : So where is the U.S. in all of this now ? \nI mean , I got the feeling talking to a couple people in the administration over the weekend that they are kind of watching like the rest of us in some ways thinking , you know , which way will this going to go ? \nThey are trying to be encouraging without intervening . \nYou know , it 's another tight rope you have to walk because you do n't want to look like you are pushing something on them . \nWhat is our best stance now ? \nIs it just to stand back and say let us know what you need ? \nNEGROPONTE : Well , I have difficult visualizing us doing that given our behavior during the last two , three weeks . \nI mean , I have a feeling we 'll play a fairly proactive role . \nI think it would be good to restrain ourselves , but I think we 're going to play a role of holding the military 's feet to the fire so that it continues to be responsive to these popular demands , revise the constitution , make it possible for more people to run , make it possible for multiple political parties to thrive sort of all the while at the same time making it clear that it 's up to the Egyptians themselves to decide . \nCROWLEY : I want to talk about what 's at stake with U.S.-Egyptian relations and the basic fight against terror , but I want to take a break . \nSo if you 'll stand by with me , up next we want to go to CNN 's Fareed Zakaria and we 're going to get his take on the future in Egypt . \nCROWLEY : Joining me now from our New York bureau , Fareed Zakaria , host of CNN 's `` Fareed Zakaria : GPS . '' \nFareed , I know you have just wrapped up a couple of important interviews , one of them with a man who has become , really , the face of the protesters . \nWhat did you learn ? \nFAREED ZAKARIA , CNN : Mohamed ElBaradei -- actually , it was interesting . \nI think there is some unease among the opposition groups that they have gotten their first go , which was getting rid of Mubarak , but this was n't a personality thing . \nThey wanted to get rid of the regime , the military dictatorship . \nAnd they feel that the military , which is now in place with absolute powers , really , is not being clear about exactly what the road map to democracy is . \nAnd what ElBaradei told me was , unless , by Friday , they have a fairly specific road map for democracy and a road map for a transitional government , a co-management of the process , the protests will begin again on Friday . \nCROWLEY : Well , that seems , like , a little problematic . \nDoes he think that , actually -- I mean , given this is a government that 's been entrenched for three decades , that it is something that they can actually do by Friday ? \nZAKARIA : I think what he 's looking for are signs that the government realizes this is a transitional period ; in other words , some kind of government of national unity or some , as he puts it , co - management of a process so that it 's not entirely up to the military . \nThen he wanted a series of more specific things , some of which , by the way , the military have just agreed to . \nAs we 've been having this conversation , there is a fifth military communique out in which the military does say that they are going to dissolve parliament ; they are going to hold new elections , though no timetable for when those would happen . \nThey explained that the Constitution is now no longer active , which makes sense because the way Mubarak left was , you know , kind of , unconstitutional . \nHe -- he would n't normally have handed power to somebody else , the speaker of the national assembly . \nSo some of that has been clarified , but the crucial issue of when these elections are going to be held , what the sequence is , parliament first then presidential elections or the other way around , none of that has been clarified . \nAnd I think the protesters are just uneasy at the prospect that they have lost Mubarak but they 've gained a military dictatorship . \nCROWLEY : Fareed Zakaria , we will be joining you at the top of the hour . \nWe want you to stay tuned for Fareed Zakaria . \nIt is at the top of this hour . \nWe have more with our ambassadors , though , when we come back . \nCROWLEY : We are back with Edward Walker and John Negroponte , two men with long resumes steeped in this region and elsewhere . \nIt seems to me that there are questions and analysis that come out now that show us two sides . \nSo here 's what -- here 's what I 'm hearing . \nI want to get you all to comment . \nOther Arab allies in the region , Saudi Arabia , Jordan among them , have been upset with the U.S. , feeling that they cut Mubarak off and pushed him off a cliff . \nSo they will either step back because they 're upset with the U.S. , or they are now prone to work more with the U.S. on putting more democracy , if that 's the word -- or making their societies freer . \nWhat -- how are our good allies in that region going to react to this ? \nWALKER : Well , you 've got -- King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia is quite upset . \nI think there -- he genuinely thought that we pushed Mubarak off a cliff . \nAnd , obviously , these other guys are concerned about what will happen if their people start to get anxious . \nAnd what will our position be ? \nSo there 's a little bit of mending fences that 's going to have to take place and reassurances that have to be taking place . \nI do n't think the problem is so great in Jordan . \nHis problem is his own people . \nHe 's got to look out for that first . \nCROWLEY : I did hear from -- on both sides of this diplomatic equation that the Saudis were quite upset and they said it says something about whether you will stand by your friends , the way you 've treated Mubarak , that that was the message that they sent . \nIs that permanent damage , or ... NEGROPONTE : I do n't think it 's permanent damage , but I also think it 's , sort of , a classic issue when you have a transition from an authoritarian regime to some -- some kind of change . \nWe 've seen this happen in the past as well . \nBut it 's going to call for more diplomacy between us and the region , the entire region , and I think that the relationships will survive . \nWALKER : Yes , it 's also -- it 's also going to require one message coming out of the United States . \nAnd we 've had just too many different voices coming out and indications of differences within the White House or within the State Department and so on . \nSo we need to get the message straight . \nCROWLEY : And what do you think that message is now ? \nWALKER : Look , we 're in favor of what 's happened , Mubarak out . \nWe 're in favor of a constitutional government , reformed constitutional government . \nWe 're in favor of free and fair elections . \nAll those things are still there . \nCROWLEY : But I have had administration officials say to me , look , the president was very clear from the beginning that he wanted -- that he believed in the rights of the protesters to be there and that he wanted the Mubarak government to open up to their demands and to listen to them and that there was n't any kind of cacophony coming out of the White House or coming out of the State Department , that everybody was in synch because the policy was very clear from the beginning . \nNEGROPONTE : But I think , in addition to what Ambassador Walker just said , yes , we favor these development and we 're supportive , but at the same time we 're not naive . \nWe were n't born yesterday . \nWe know these things take time and that it 's a long-term process and that , while a democratic and representative government may be the long-term goal , we in fact think that democracy and representative government is probably the best way to assure long-term stability of a country and of a region . \nBut we realize it 's going to take time and it 's going to happen in different ways . \nCROWLEY : Stability in the meantime in the middle . \nNEGROPONTE : There is always that risk . \nCROWLEY : Let me ask you about a couple of other things . \nOne is , there is one theory that this was a great victory for al Qaeda . \nThere is another theory that , no , this was devastating to al Qaeda , because first of all the Muslim Brotherhood , the most organized group in Egypt and al Qaeda are enemies . \nAnd second of all , what this has shown is that by peaceful means you can take over a government , that it does n't need to be by al Qaeda means . \nDid al Qaeda win or lose in all of this ? \nWALKER : Al Qaeda lost on this , because al Qaeda has basically said all along that this is a situation that ca n't be fixed by the people . \nIt has to be fixed by violent revolution and we represent violent revolution . \nAnd that 's been their pitch to the Arab people . \nNow they have been shown to be , you know , without any basis for their complaints . \nCROWLEY : Let me ask you about Israel . \nAnd that is there is one school of thought that says , well , now because of uncertainty they are going to be less willing to engage in the peace process with the Palestinians . \nThere is another that says , no , they will be more willing to engage because they have seen , you know , what 's happened in Egypt . \nSo , are they more or less willing ? \nNEGROPONTE : Well I 'm not certain , but I think Israel certainly must take some reassurance from the fact that the Egyptian military have reaffirmed their commitment to their international -- the country 's international agreements . \nRead : commitment to the Arab - Israeli peace process . \nSo , I think that 's good . \nCROWLEY : And let me ask you about U.S.-Egyptian intelligence information-sharing . \nOne theory , well , you know , because this will be a new government that might not be able to or actually be as friendly to the U.S. as Mubarak was , we are losing a key intelligence partner here who helped with al Qaeda , who has helped with Iran , who has helped in Gaza . \nOr because it 's a democracy and we are going to share these values , it will even be of greater help . \nNEGROPONTE : Well , I mean , let me put it this way the most effective and best intelligence cooperation we have around the world is with the most democratic countries . \nThere is a group called the five eyes which consists of the United States , Australia , the United Kingdom , Canada and New Zealand . \nThat 's where we have our best intelligence cooperation . \nI rest my case . \nWALKER : Yes , but also keep in mind the Egyptians have a vested interest in some of the same things we have a vested interest in and that is to deter radicalism in the Middle East and so there will be strong incentive for the intelligence community to continue cooperation . \nCROWLEY : Edward Walker , John Negroponte , thanks for traveling this road with us . \nI really appreciate it . \nUp next , the upcoming showdown in Washington over the president 's new budget . \n-LRB- COMMERCIAL BREAK -RRB- CROWLEY : President Obama submits his 2012 budget to Congress tomorrow and the White House promises major cuts . \nThat may depend on your definition of `` major . '' \nAs part of his package the president will call for a five-year freeze on discretionary spending , which is to say programs the federal government is not required by law to fund . \nSome programs will get more money , some less . \nOn the less list -- a $ 350 million cut in community service programs , $ 300 million for local housing and economic development programs , and a $ 125 million cut for environmental cleanup . \nAll told , the freeze would save about $ 400 billion over ten years . \nThat 's real money except the u.s. debt is $ 14.1 trillion -- with a t. That is jaw-dropping money . \nCritics say the problem is discretionary programs really are not really the problem . \nAlan Simpson is co-chair of the president 's debt commission . \nALAN SIMPSON , CO-CHAIR , DEBT COMMISSION : I 'm waiting for politicians to get up and say there is only one way to do this , you dig into the big four : Medicare , Medicaid , Social Security and Defense . \nAnd anybody giving you anything different than that , you want to walk out the door , stick your finger down your throat and give them the green weenie . \nCROWLEY : Which is to say what 's blowing up the budget is in large part the programs the federal government is required to fund -- up next , White House budget director Jacob Lew . \nCROWLEY : Joining me now here in Washington , White House budget director Jacob Lew . \nThank you for being here . \nThe president tomorrow puts out the fiscal year 2012 budget . \nPeople are already lost . \nWhy are we doing 2012 in 2011 and all of that . \nSo let 's get down to the basic question , who 's going to get hurt in this budget ? \nLEW : You know , Candy , this is a very difficult budget . \nThe budget saves $ 1.1 trillion over the next 10 years in domestic spending . \nIt reduces , as you said in your introduction , $ 400 billion , which would bring us down to the smallest government as a size of the economy since Eisenhower was president . \nLEW : The challenge we have is to live within our means but also invest in the future . \nAs the president said , we have to out-educate , out-innovate and outbuild in order to compete in the next century . \nIn order to do that , we have to make tough tradeoffs . \nAnd you listed a few of the examples . \nThere are many , many more . \nThere are scores of programs that are being reduced . \nAnd I think it 's important to note that we 're beyond the easy , low-hanging fruit to say that it 's all waste and fraud . \nWe 're reducing programs that are important programs that we care about , and we 're doing what every family does when it sits around its kitchen table . \nWe 're making the choice about what do we need for the future ? \nAnd I think the budget does a very good job of it . \nCROWLEY : So , such as ? \nTell us some more ... CROWLEY : ... where are the cuts ? \nLEW : I can tell you that in -- even where we invest , we 've had to make some tough decisions for cutbacks . \nSo in education , we invest very seriously to make sure that 9 million students can go to college using Pell grant , to make sure that K-12 education -- we have 100,000 new teachers who are trained and experienced in science , technology , engineering and math . \nBut we also have cutbacks . \nIn order to pay for the Pell increase , one of the things we 're doing is saying there will be no more Pell grants for the summer ; they will be for the school year only . \nIn the area ... CROWLEY : No summer school Pell grants from the government ? \nLEW : Yes , and in the area of graduate student loans , interest will start building up while students are in school . \nCROWLEY : Now they graduate , and then the interest starts ? \nAll told , there 's $ 9 billion in those proposals this year , and that will make it possible to make sure that 9 million students can go to college . \nCROWLEY : So you have said in an editorial you wrote that the budget is an expression of our values and aspirations . \nSo if I look at this what we call discretionary spending , things we do n't have to spend on , you want to cut back community development block programs . \nThat creates jobs in communities ; it helps them with infrastructure , that kind of thing . \nHome heating assistance ; education , as you just mentioned . \nYou 're also going to do -- the Great Lakes Restoration Fund Initiative is getting a pretty healthy cut in what they get from the feds , eight states involved , in trying to keep the Great Lakes economically viable . \nWhat does that say about our values and aspirations ? \nLEW : Well , what it says , Candy , is that we really do have to do what every American family does ; we have to start living within our means . \nOur budget will get us , over the next several years , to the point where we can look the American people in the eye and say we 're not adding to the debt anymore ; we 're spending money that we have each year , and then we can work on bringing down our national debt . \nYou know , the notion that we can do this painlessly is -- it 's not possible to do it painlessly . \nWe are going to make tough choices . \nThe question is , do we do it in a way where , while we 're making the tough tradeoffs , we 're making the critical investments so that we have a future that creates jobs for the American people so that we can outcompete in the world of the 21st century . \nCROWLEY : Here 's the problem , I guess . \nIf you are a graduate -- let 's take one of your examples . \nYou 're a graduate student ; you are , right now , getting loans . \nYou do n't have to pay those loans or any interest on them until you graduate . \nBut now you have to pay -- or it accumulates , I 'm assuming -- you have to pay interest beginning on day one of grad school , and that makes it so that you ca n't go to grad school . \nLEW : Well , let 's just be clear . \nInterest will build up , but students wo n't have to pay until they graduate . \nSo it will increase the burden for paying back the loans , but it will not reduce access to education . \nThat 's , I think , part of how you can responsibly have a plan that deals with the challenge of solving our fiscal crisis , getting out of the situation where the deficit is growing and growing , but also investing in the future . \nWe have a responsible budget that will cut in half the deficit by the end of the president 's first term . \nIt deals with all parts of the budget , and it 's a plan which we look forward to presenting it to the Congress and getting a bipartisan discussion going on how to achieve it . \nCROWLEY : The president had a debt commission . \nThey put out a big long report on how to get out of this -- of the debt -- not the yearly deficit but the accumulative number that we are in the red , which is in the trillions , $ 14.1 trillion , I believe , is where we are . \nAnd yet very little of that is reflected in this budget . \nWhy was there a debt commission to begin with , since everybody seems determined to ignore what you heard Alan Simpson call the big four , Medicare , Medicaid , Social Security and defense . \nI know there are cuts in defense , but the commission found many , many more . \nWhy even bother if this document is n't going to reflect it ? \nLEW : First , I would say that the commission did a very important job . \nIt framed ... CROWLEY : But everybody , kind of , says that . \nLEW : It framed a discussion which is very much influencing how everyone working on the budget going forward thinks about it . \nThere 's more on the table , more that 's open for the kind of civil discourse that we need in order to make the tough decisions . \nIn our budget , there are many , many ideas that one can look to the commission where they took leadership , medical malpractice , corporate tax reform , pay freeze for the federal government . \nThere are many , many provisions in our budget which were part of what the commission proposed . \nI think it 's a mistake to say that the commission 's report did not have an impact . \nIt had a very significant impact . \nCROWLEY : But , basically , they say , look , discretionary spending , great ; we should cut back plenty of things , but what about Medicare ? \nAnd where are you on -- where are the big ideas for the big programs that suck money out of the economy ? \nLEW : Well , I think , if you look at the entitlements , we have some important policy in this budget . \nThere 's a provision that , for the last number of years , Congress has passed on a bipartisan basis to make sure that the payments to doctors under Medicare do n't get cut . \nThe problem is , if the payments to doctors are cut , their willingness to treat Medicare patients would go down . \nCROWLEY : That does n't cut the budget , though . \nLEW : Well , when you put it on the national credit card and you say we 're not going to let those changes take effect , it increases the deficit . \nCROWLEY : But is that the big kind of thing that they talked about on the debt commission ? \nThere 's nothing about Social Security . \nLEW : We have $ 62 billion of savings to pay for dealing with that provision in Medicare over the next two years . \nThat 's real money ; $ 62 billion is real money . \n-LRB- CROSSTALK -RRB- LEW : In terms of Social Security , let 's also be clear that Social Security is not contributing to the short-term debt . \nSocial Security is a separate issue . \nIt 's something where we have an obligation to the American people to make sure that Social Security is sound for this generation and the next generation . \nAnd the president said he wants to work on a bipartisan basis to deal with Social Security . \nCROWLEY : But there 's no -- there 's no big ideas , I guess , no big , OK , we 're going to bite the bullet here ; Medicare needs to be means-tested ; Social Security -- you know , the amount of income that you pay Social Security taxes on should go up . \nThere 's nothing like those big things that really ... LEW : Well , I disagree with that . \nThe president took office and we were on a path where the deficit was growing over 10 percent of our economy . \nNow , he 's put forward a plan that will bring it down in the middle of the decade to a sustainable level . \nThat is a big idea . \nBecause , as every family knows , if you 're having trouble paying your bills , you have to stop adding to the balance . \nAnd he has a plan that would do that . \nHe 's called it a downpayment and it 's a responsible downpayment , and he 's extended his hand to work on a bipartisan basis to deal with the long-term problems . \nI think we have to get that accomplished in the next few years . \nCROWLEY : I need a yes or no from you about the 2011 budget , which still has n't been passed . \nHouse Republicans believe they can take $ 100 billion out of that , right now , for this bill that goes until next October . \nIs that doable -- not the way they want it . \nIs it even doable to take $ 100 billion out of that budget ? \nLEW : Candy , we have a responsible plan that 's before Congress . \nWe look forward to working with Congress . \nWe think that there is a way to reduce spending . \nWe all agree we need to reduce spending ... LEW : ... and we have to do it in a way that 's consistent with our values and invests in the future . \nWe look forward to working with the Congress on that . \nCROWLEY : $ 100 billion , yes or no ? \nLEW : We look forward to working with Congress . \nCROWLEY : Jacob Lew , thank you so much . \nLEW : Thanks for having me . \nCROWLEY : Thanks for watching `` State of the Union . '' \nWe hope you will join us next week when our guest will be defense secretary -- former defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld . \nI 'm Candy Crowley in Washington . \n"}
{"id": "124", "time": "2011-02-13", "text": "Chaos in Egypt ; AOL Buys HuffPo Aired February 13 , 2011 - 11:00 ET THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT . \nHOWARD KURTZ , HOST : News was on television , on the web , everywhere , Hosni Mubarak was about to step down . \nAnd then he did n't . \nAn Egyptian official he would n't , and then the next day he did . \nHave journalists been too quick to pass on unconfirmed reports and did they get swept by the jubilation on streets of Cairo ? \nAOL buys the `` Huffington Post '' for $ 315 million with Arianna Huffington becoming its news czar , but will life inside a big corporation change the essence of what made the liberal site so popular ? \nKeith Olbermann joins forces with Al Gore , becoming the chief news officer and primetime host at tiny Current TV . \nIs this a step down for MSNBC 's liberal lion ? \nPlus , Gawker runs flirtatious e-mails from a shirtless congressman , and before the rest of the media can agree whether it 's news , the lawmaker resigns . \nWe 'll talk to the reporter who cracked the case . \nI 'm Howard Kurtz and this is RELIABLE SOURCES . \nThe street protest that produced a revolution in Egypt had been remarkable to watch , but the chaotic nature of the story has often left journalists scrambling for information and sometimes getting ahead of the facts . \nThat was the case on Thursday when many news organizations agreed that the drama of Hosni Mubarak was coming to an end . \nHere 's what it looked like . \nThere in Egypt , live pictures at the moment . \nWe have had two separate sources telling us that President Mubarak may be stepping down tonight . \nJOHN KING , CNN : I 'm also told by a senior official that privately they have received word from ranking officials in the Mubarak regime that generally give them reliable information that the plan is in place for President Mubarak to yield power to the vice president . \nBut I will add , as the source I spoke to added with me , a little bit of caution and skepticism . \nRICHARD ENGEL , NBC NEWS : We are hearing stronger than that from two independent sources close to the president , that President Mubarak will likely step down . \nTwo separate sources close to the president say President Mubarak will step down . \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : We have a fast-moving situation right now on the streets of Cairo and we 're getting information that President Mubarak may step down as soon as this afternoon . \nWOLF BLITZER , CNN : Victory , victory , that may be soon at hand for Egypt 's pro-democracy protesters . \nPresident Hosni Mubarak expected to announce on Egyptian television within this hour or next hour , but very soon we 're told , that he is stepping down and ending his 30 years in power . \nCHRIS MATTHEWS , MSNBC : The only thing clear in the long statement from President Mubarak was that he 's not leaving Egypt . \nNo indication that he 's giving up power . \nIt seemed defiant in a very sad way . \nBLITZER : All right , there you just heard the president of Egypt at least , according to that translation , I did not hear him utter the words that I am stepping down . \nKURTZ : Because he did not utter those words . \nBut , on Friday , of course , came word that Mubarak finally had resigned , setting off utter jubilation across the country , and correspondents that got caught up in the celebration . \nHARRY SMITH , CBS NEWS : There 's a state of euphoria , a state of disbelief . \nPeople are almost afraid to believe what they know in her hearts is true , that Mubarak is gone . \nKURTZ : But did journalists rush to judgment before that ? \nJoining us now here in Washington , Jeffrey Goldberg , national correspondent for the Atlantic . \nAnd in Jerusalem , Janine Zacharia , the bureau chief there for the `` Washington Post . '' \nAnd in Paris , Christopher Dickey , Middle East regional editor for `` Newsweek , '' who just got off a plane from Cairo about an hour ago . \nAnd Chris Dickey , so many news outlets as you saw , as you heard reporting on Thursday that Mubarak had resigned . \nIn such a chaotic situation , should n't journalists have been more cautious ? \nCHRISTOPHER DICKEY , NEWSWEEK : Yes , I think people should have been more cautious . \nAs I was starting to get those reports , I kept saying to myself , hold back , because the characteristic of the Egyptian revolution has been the ability of the people and the government to surprise us again and again and again . \nEverything that we thought was predictable in Egypt has been unpredictable . \nSo this seems like another possibility , and in fact it was not what anybody thought was going to happen . \nPeople around the president really did think he was going to resign , and then he did n't . \nKURTZ : And Jeff Goldberg , however we try to rationalize it , and this was sort of like watching the journalistic sausage being made , but those stories were wrong . \nJEFFREY GOLDBERG , THE NEW YORKER : The stories were premature , let 's call it that . \nThey were wrong , and that 's an excellent point . \nI do n't know if Mubarak knew what he was going to do . \nAnd this whole notion that two sources in the palace , we have it independently confirmed , it was utter chaos from what I 've seen . \nI 've been in those situations before . \nNo one knows anything about anything . \nSo a great deal of caution is necessary . \nKURTZ : So relying on sources to provide a definitive account of something that has not yet happened is very dangerous . \nHURTZ : Janine Zacharia , the Egyptian military announcing this morning without warning that it has suspended the constitution , dissolved parliament , and has set up a six-month transition government . \nWith that and with what 's happened in the last three weeks , how hard is it in the Middle East to separate rumor -- to separate fact I should say from rumor and speculation ? \nJANINE ZACHARIA , WASHINGTON POST : Well , it certainly has been very difficult . \nCertainly over the last 18 days when you do n't really have , as Jeffrey pointed out , you do n't really have any official spokesman -- you do n't have -- everybody is sort of hiding from NDP , Mubarak 's party , and it 's very hard to really confirm anything . \nIt seems like the military , however , is taking a different approach and being very direct about what they are saying . \nOn the early reports , though , Howie , I think a lot of people got caught up , remember in that press conference or that statement that the military had made , and interpreted from it that that meant Mubarak was leaving . \nThen you had the Leon Panetta thing on the Hill , which misled a lot of people , but certainly jumping the gun like that was really irresponsible . \nKURTZ : Just to explain , the CIA director said that he expected Mubarak to step down and he later backtracked and said he was reacting to media reports . \nLet me play for you something CNN 's Anderson Cooper said after that bizarre Mubarak address on Thursday . \nANDERSON COOPER , CNN : What we heard were the same lies we 've heard from him and his regime for more than two weeks now . \nWhat we heard is a man who clearly believes that he is Egypt . \nHe kept repeating this lie that this is all some sort of foreign interference . \n-LRB- END VIDEO CLIP -RRB- KURTZ : Chris Dickey , Anderson Cooper repeatedly using the word lies . \nNow I think most journalists would agree with him , perhaps most Americans would agree with him . \nBut should an anchor and correspondent being taking sides on this kind of story ? \nDICKEY : I think Anderson sort of -- that 's part of the soul of his show is to take sides and be passionate and come across as someone who 's reasonable , but committed to a certain vision of the story . \nIn fact , I do n't think lies is an exaggerated word to use in this context . \nI mean , when you have a head of a state who 's telling one untruth after another and they are certifiable , and then we come into the situation where he really is lying not only to the country but probably to himself . \nI think Anderson can be forgiven for using that word in that context . \nKURTZ : And of course , Anderson Cooper was repeatedly punched in the head when he was covering the demonstrations during those couple of days when they turned violent and when journalists were not just attacked but targeted for attacks . \nJeff Goldberg , a lot of euphoria in the coverage . \nI 'm wondering whether or not there was another side of the story . \n`` Time '' magazine , for example , quoted a couple of Egyptians as saying they did n't want Mubarak to leave or at least not so quickly , because they valued stability in the country . \nAnd there 's also the argument , of course , that Mubarak staying was better for the U.S. because we do n't know what 's going to come next . \nSo what did you make of that aspect of the coverage , where the journalists really seemed to swing behind let 's get rid of this guy ? \nGOLDBERG : Well , do n't forget . \nDuring the Bush administration , there was a period when Bush and Condoleezza Rice were speaking out very strongly against -- at least rhetorically opposed to the Mubarak regime and talking about the necessity for democracy . \nAnd there was a great deal of skepticism in the American media about this line of attack on Mubarak , and everybody was then a foreign policy realist and saying Mubarak has been a stalwart ally of the U.S. , which is true , helped us in the war on terror , which is true . \nKeeps peace with Israel , which is true . \nNow everybody has sort of swung the other way , probably over simplistically as well , and said this is the only storyline , that Mubarak was an evil dictator and he 's gone and it 's better for everyone . \nNow , it 's true . \nIt 's probably better for Egypt , but what that 's missing is all of the complexity of this . \nEgypt has not experienced democracy before . \nIt 's been one dictator after another , and I think we 're losing sight of the fact that now comes the interesting and hard part for Egypt . \nKURTZ : If you throw too much complexity in , will you ruin my storyline here ? \nI want a simple storyline . \nJanine , what these protesters accomplished in 18 days was just extraordinary . \nBut is it possible that there are also millions of Americans -LRB- sic -RRB- who stayed home , who had a different view of whether this regime should be toppled in this dramatic fashion ? \nZACCHARIA : Well , you know , I think as you were saying , Howie , I mean , some of the breathless coverage that we saw and the fact that all of the pictures , as Frank Sesno said last week , we 're just addicted to the picture . \nAll of the reporting for television was from Tahrir Square , like the size of the meadowlands basically in New York . \nI mean , there was not any reporting from anywhere else in the country that day . \nIt was very hard to get some sort of quote\\/unquote , `` balanced pictures , '' and people just got very swept up in it . \nSo I think maybe in retrospect perhaps that was another thing , but it would n't have been as exciting as being there in this sort of post Super Bowl atmosphere . \nI think one of the other things we have to do when we look back at the coverage is sort of the way that rumor as you mentioned earlier was used . \nI mean , it was sort of like any guy with a laptop.com was enough to then run with the story without any kind of confirmation . \nThat was enough to propel the story forward . \nSo I think -LRB- inaudible -RRB- , but on a plus side , when was the last time that the U.S. domestic audience was focused on a foreign story for 18 days ? \nI mean , it is historic like President Obama said . \nKURTZ : Well , that is absolutely true . \nProject for Excellence in Journalism finding that 32 percent of Americans following the story very closely , that doubled from the previous week . \nBut this post-Super Bowl atmosphere that you referred to . \nI want to play a clip -- let me say first of all , I think CNN , you know , which has a great international network , did a superlative job during this crisis . \nBut NBC 's Richard Engel , I thought , you know , really kind of typified the enthusiasm because has so often reported from the middle of those crows . \nLet 's play a brief sound bite of Engel on Friday . \nRICHARD ENGEL , NBC CHIEF FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT : Many Egyptians never thought that they would live to see this day . \nThis is certainly a turning point in this country and , Brian , it could be a turning point for the Middle East . \nKURTZ : Chris Dickey , is it possible to stand in that sea of humanity , people screaming , crying and just joyous and not get swept away and lose any sense of objectivity ? \nDICKEY : Yes , it 's possible . \nBut on the other hand , when you 're in the middle of a moment like that and you 're reporting it live on the air , you want to catch the sentiment that exists around you . \nYou can step back when that moment passed and it 's over already . \nAnd you can take a look at the context that created it and what 's going to come after . \nYou can even take a look at the Mubaraks . \nI have a long piece in the new edition of `` Newsweek '' about the tragedy of the Mubaraks who probably really did think that they were doing good all these years but were totally out of touch with their people . \nOn the other hand , if you 're in Tahrir Square , you are in touch with hundreds of thousands of people sharing the same emotion and you 'd look like kind of silly if you were crossing your arms and saying , well , it 's not really as great as all that . \nGOLDBERG : Well , no , exactly the point I wanted to make which is that you 're being hugged and kissed and there 's euphoria all around you . \nAnd it might not be the moment to say , of course , foreign policy challenges remain and we do n't know , of course , if the army is going to , you know -- you 're not going to be able to deliver that level of analysis in the heat of the moment . \nBut , you know , the entire -- you have a structure around you . \nYou have a network and you have other reports who can sort of introduce those questions pretty quickly . \nKURTZ : Well , we 'll have a chance to do that in the coming days when we do n't have the pictures of people celebrating and\\/or protesting in Tahrir Square . \nThat will be a harder story as you were alluding to earlier . \nGOLDBERG : But this is the problem . \nI mean , that once Tahrir Square is empty , now the hard part begins and Egypt 's direction is now being settled . \nAnd I 'm afraid , of course , that we 're going , you know , in two weeks or three weeks people are going to barely remember that there was this revolution in Egypt , or two or three days . \nKURTZ : That is the challenge for journalism . \nJeffrey Goldberg , Janine Zacharia , Christopher Dickey , thanks very much for joining us . \nWhen we come back , AOL 's big get . \nWhat is buying `` The Huffington Post '' mean for the company and for Arianna 's very popular and very liberal side ? \nKURTZ : It began nearly six years ago at Arianna Huffington 's L.A. mansion with a bunch of her liberal friends . \nThe idea : to create a Web site that would help Democrats by offering a lefty alternative to the Drudge Report . \nBut through smart packaging , a strong dose of culture and entertainment and aggressively linking to other people 's work , The Huffington Post grew into a blockbuster now drawing nearly 25 million readers a month . \nThis week , Huffington announced a deal with AOL 's chief executive Tim Armstrong , the Web site , that always touted its independence from the corporate media , was being sold or sold out , some critics complain , to a major corporation . \n-LRB- BEGIN VIDEOTAPE -RRB- KARA SWISHER , `` BOOMTOWN '' COLUMN WRITER FOR ALLTHINGSDIGITAL.COM : Why did you sell `` The Huffington Post '' besides the giant pile of money Tim is shoving your way ? \nARIANNA HUFFINGTON : And I had just made new year 's resolution already for the end of the year -- SWISHER : Which was to sell your -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- for a giant amount of money ? \nHUFFINGTON : -- which was for us to accelerate everything we were doing . \nTo going to lockout -LRB- ph -RRB- in time for the presidential election , to go to Brazil where I had just come from and where we wanted to launch Huffington -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- to go global . \nSo the way that our vision came together . \nClassified -LRB- ph -RRB- that we both believe in real journalism or regional reporting and hiring a lot of both established journalists . \nKURTZ : So what does all this mean , not just for Arianna and AOL , but for the growing clout of online media ? \nJoining us now here in Washington , Mark Potts , Internet Media and Strategy Consultant and a former `` Washington Post '' reporter . \nIn New York , Felix Salmon , the business blogger for Reuters . \nAnd in San Francisco , Kara Swisher , co-executive editor of `` All Things Digital , '' the journalist who broke the story and conducted that interview we just saw with Arianna Huffington . \nSo Kara Swisher , what does this deal tell us about the value and influence and clout of online media sites ? \nSWISHER : Well , it was a couple of things going on . \nObviously , it 's a lot of money for a site that does n't make a lot of money . \nSo that says a lot . \nMeaning `` The Huffington Post '' is just like other Internet companies . \nBut I think it says that Tim , for one , AOL really needs something exciting . \nAnd to them , `` The Huffington Post '' was the exciting , sort of , addition to their strategy of premium content . \nAnd for online , I think it 's probably a little bit of a hype that it means something for online content . \nOnline content has been developing for a long time and here 's the first example of one of the biggest sales of it . \nAnd I do n't think it means that it 's growing in power , it just means that people are using it and therefore the more prominent ones are going to be sold for a lot of money . \nKURTZ : Felix Salmon , more original reporting in recent years , but it 's know more , if you look at the sign as I know you have , for aggregation of other people 's work , packaging more than original journalism . \nHow is that worth 300 million bucks ? \nFELIX SALMON , FMR . \nWRITER FOR EUROMONEY MAGAZINE AND PORTFOLIO MAGAZINE : It 's actually not a particularly high valuation . \nIf you look at what lugs -LRB- ph -RRB- of value that when there are acquisitions like this , it 's normally in the sort of five to six times revenues range or -- and if you look at any of the ratios here , they 're pretty much in line . \nIf anything , it 's a little bit low . \nBack in December , people were saying that `` The Huffington Post '' was worth somewhere between $ 300 and $ 450 million . \nAnd this is the lower end of that range . \nSo if you just look at the financials , it 's a pretty justifiable price , I think . \nAnd the fact is the page views and audience and loyalty are what `` The Huffington Post '' has . \nIt 's not really a matter of who broke the story in the first place . \nThat has some value , but there 's a lot of value outside that . \nHURTZ : Loyalty very important online , Mark Potts , and Arianna Huffington also becoming the editorial director for all of AOL 's content . \nWhat exactly does she bring to the company we used to call America Online ? \nMARK POTTS , CO-FOUNDED WASHINGTONPOST.COM : That 's a good question . \nI 'm a big fan of Arianna . \nI think she 's done a great job as an impresario , a promoter , building `` Huffington Post . '' \nI 'm not sure she brings that much to AOL as an editorial brain . \nI think there are others at `` The Huffington Post '' who contribute a lot to the success of what the site is now , in creating what it is editorially . \nAnd I wonder if Arianna actually is one who did that and how much she brings to AOL . \nKURTZ : Well , she brings a name , obviously , and personality . \nKara Swisher , you know , `` The Huffington Post '' has its own very distinct personality and always had its independence . \nHow will being part of a big corporation change that ? \nSWISHER : I do n't know if she 'll it at all . \nI think actually she does bring that . \nShe 's a lightning rod . \nShe attracts attention consistently . \nShe 's on television all the time . \nYou know , AOL has no personality whatsoever in terms of editorial . \nAnd this brings a personality to it , who manages to bring in some excitement . \nSo , I do n't think that 's necessarily not unimportant for them . \nI mean , you 'd rather be -- If you 're Tim Armstrong , you 're the guy who 's selling AOL content and I do n't even know what that is , or you will be the guy that bought Arianna Huffington 's blog . \nAnd so , I think she will be much more involved than you think . \nKURTZ : Would I be more likely as a reader to click on any of the other blogs that AOL has , whether it 's `` In Gadget '' or `` Tech Crunch '' because it 's got Arianna ? \nSWISHER : No , no , no. . \nBut I say -- but it brings attention to AOL as an editorial property . \nJust like any prominent editor would . \nI mean , that 's -- it 's so easy to think that because she is so interesting as a personality in journalism . \nAt the same time , you know , some of those sites are actually pretty good . \nThey are very in and of their own right . \nI think it just brings cohesion , I guess , of what they 're doing and I think a lot of people have been confused about what Tim Armstrong is doing at AOL and the stock has reflected that . \nKURTZ : Felix Salmon , an `` L.A. Times '' columnist described `` The Huffington Post '' as a galley rowed by slaves commanded by pirates . \nThis is , of course , a reference in the business model in which most of the outside contributors are not paid a dime . \nIs that a good business model ? \nSALMON : It 's a fantastic business model if you can get content for free . \nKURTZ : What about if you 're a writer ? \nSALMN : These are people who are contributing for their own reasons . \nAnd actually Nate Silver has a great column in `` The New York Times '' explaining that they do n't account for a huge proportion of `` The Huffington Post '' total . \nHe 's paying it 's about 4 percent . \nIt might be a little bit more than that , but not much . \nThey provide a base and a voice . \nAnd I think one of things that Arianna wants to do is to plug into AOL 's local network or patch , and use all of those extra people around the country to do reporting in the 2012 campaign and that kind of thing . \nAnd voice is incredibly important online , it 's the reason that people come back . \nAnd , of course , the other reason which you have n't quite touched on yet is that Tim Armstrong was buying technology . \n`` The Huffington Post '' is a incredibly sophisticated technology company and that technology is very valuable to AOL . \nKURTZ : It , also , Mark Potts was a well deserved representation as being on the left . \nAs I said , it was founded in order to be on the left . \nMost of the columnists are liberal . \nMost of the lawmakers who have posts are Democrats . \nBut Arianna Huffington told me this week , well , she wants to move beyond these left\\/right debates . \nAnd she is de-emphasizing politics , or at least it makes up only 15 percent of her total traffic . \nBut I 'm wondering whether being part of AOL will accelerate that process and people who are liberal and who like the liberal voice of `` Huff Post '' will feel that it 's been lost or faded . \nPOTTS : I think it 's a fair question . \nI think she risks diluting her own brand by moving more towards the center and she 's definitely saying all the right things about trying to be more centrist that she 's now with a news company rather than an opinion company . \nAnd with AOL , she wants to -- she wants to toe the middle line . \nBut there are people who come to `` Huffington Post '' because they like the left-leaning . \nAnd if they like it going away , and has been drifting away from that , has been drifting more towards the center , if they feel like it going away , it wo n't be the same product for them . \n-LRB- CROSSTALK -RRB- SWISHER : I 'm just saying , she 's been doing -- she 's been attacking the Obama administration . \nShe 's one of the most prominent critics in the past year . \nSo , she does what she feels like . \nI do n't think she 's -- I do n't think -- she likes to say she 's not left or right . \nShe 's obviously more left-leaning . \nBut I mean , I think she likes to do what 's interesting and dramatic . \nSo , I think you 're going to see that more than anything else . \nPOTTS : But let 's face it , over the career , she 's been both left and right . \nKURTZ : Yes , she once was a -- somebody who was a confidant of Newt Gingrich , married to a Republican congressman . \nKURTZ : But you said earlier that AOL did n't much for identity . \nYou 've written a book on AOL . \nWhy does it seem , at least until now , as kind of a hodge-podge of different sites without a real strong brand ? \nSWISHER : Because it 's a hodge-podge of different sites without a definite band . \nYou know , I think he 's been trying to pull it out . \nI think Tim has been trying to pull it out and make something of it . \nAnd actually , they 're doing what actually Yahoo ! \nprobably should be doing , create a sort of a premium content destination on the Internet . \nI mean , someone has to be the Conde Nast of the Internet . \nIt 's not right now , it 's not Conde Nast . \nBut someone 's got to form this thing and it 's not like a gigantic business in the same way . \nIt 's got the same issues about advertising and making money and bringing audience to it . \nBut someone 's got to do this . \nAnd so , he 's trying with this company that 's gone through so much history to give it -- to give it a personality and give it a definition . \nAnd people like a story and he 's trying to build a story here and this certainly adds to the excitement of that . \nKURTZ : You know , I 've been asking for a couple of years , Felix Salmon , why `` The New York Times '' or `` The Washington Post '' or CNN or any other major media company did n't start something like `` The Huffington Post . '' \nYou did something interesting . \nYou compared the front pages of `` The Huffington Post '' and `` The New York Times '' in terms of their layout , in terms of how many comments they attracted . \nWhat did you find ? \nSALMON : Well , actually , what I did is I took a `` New York Times '' story which they broke and I compared to `` The Huffington Post '' reblog of that story , where they basically took the news from `` The New York Times '' and said , `` Look , ` The New York Times ' has this news . '' \nAnd `` The Huffington Post '' page was much more interesting , had many more exit points , had the stories that my friends were reading on Facebook , had great pictures . \nIt was loads of stuff which you want to click on and you want to interact with and had thousands of comments and likes on Facebook and tweets and retweets and all the rest of it . \nWhereas , `` The New York Times '' original story which is where the real meat was had none of that really . \nIt was very dull . \nIt was gray , had a few links , no pictures . \nYou had to sort of navigate around by clicking on something called sports or something like that . \nAnd the reason why `` The Huffington Post '' has been so much more successful in many ways in terms of getting loyalty and reader engagement is because it has this technology , this architecture , which is very good at that . \nAnd `` The New York Times '' report is putting up this pay wall which is just getting to make it ever harder to get somebody who are n't already subscribers to click around and explore . \nKURTZ : But , of course , Mark Potts , as we go to break , `` The Times '' had the pay the reporter to get the story in the first place . \nPOTTS : Pay the reporter with the story , but all `` The Huffington Post '' ran was a couple of paragraphs of `` The Times '' story . \nAll you need was two paragraphs of `` The Times '' story . \nYou 'll never read the rest of `` The Times '' story . \nKURTZ : And if -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- is better and it got more people to like it on Facebook , then , obviously , it accomplished something and -- POTTS : And `` Huffington Post '' probably drives more traffic as `` The Times '' story , `` The Times '' itself does . \nSo , `` The Times '' is getting to cut that off -LRB- ph -RRB- . \nKURTZ : All right , got to go . \nMark Potts , Kara Swisher , Felix Salmon , thanks very much for joining us . \nAnd coming up in the second part of RELIABLE SOURCES , Keith Olbermann heading to Current TV . \nCan the former MSNBC star put Al Gore 's network on the map ? \nPlus , Gawker gets its man . \nWe 'll talk with the gossip reporter about , a story about a congressman 's shirtless pictures on Craigslist and how they cost him his job . \nKEITH OLBERMANN : There were many occasions , particularly in the last two and a half years were all but surrounded the show but never the show itself was too much for me . \nWith your support and loyalty , and may I use the word insistence , ultimately required that I keep going . \nKURTZ : When Keith Olbermann and MSNBC had their bitter break-up , everyone in the media world wanted to know what 's Keith is going to do next . \nWe got the answer this week when the liberal commentator joined forces with Al Gore . \nThe former vice president is the co-founder of Current TV , where Olbermann will not only launch a primetime program this spring , but serve as chief news officer . \nCurrent TV is not exactly high profile offering such programs as `` Bar Karma '' and `` Kill It , Cook It , Eat It . '' \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : Six volunteers , one Devon farm , they are here to find out where meat comes from -- to look the animals in the eye . \nIt 's -LRB- EXPLETIVE DELETED -RRB- . \nNearly half of the world 's population is without access to toilets . \nKURTZ : So will Olbermann 's new cable home diminish his clout or put Al Gore 's operation on the media map ? \nJoining us now here in Washington , Matt Lewis , blogger and political analyst for Politicsdaily.com . \nIn New York , Rachel Sklar , editor at large for mediaite.com . \nAnd in Chicago , Aaron Barnhart , television critic for the `` Kansas City Star '' and editor of TVBarn.com . \nAnd Aaron Barnhart , Olbermann cast this as a move towards media independence on his part , away from the corporate media that employed him at MSNBC , and you challenged that on the conference call that he had with reporters . \nAARON BARNHART , TVBARN.COM : I thought it was particular that I would choose that note to launch his venture on Current TV . \nBecause if you look at what he has done in those two and a half years he was talking about , he launched a free health clinic . \nHe did a number of -- you know , he was his own man . \nHe ended his worst persons in the world segment kind of on his own accord . \nBut really if you go back to his entire eight-year relationship with MSNBC , when did they not play -- when did they not march to his tune ? \nHere 's a guy who came along , and from a humble perch of an 8 p.m. show , watched by a few hundred thousand people , basically helped NBC find its voice for its cable news channel . \nHe also said on the conference call , he 's the most restless man on television . \nHe 's like a shark . \nSo at some point , it clearly got boring for him . \nKURTS : Well , now that the shark has moved to Current TV , Rachel Sklar , which averages about 23,000 viewers , I 'm told , in primetime , is this a bit of a step down for Olbermann ? \nRACHEL SKLAR , FORMER SENIOR CONTRIBUTING EDITOR FOR THE HUFFINGTON POST : It depends how you 're looking at it . \nI mean , I think Olbermann likes to fashion himself as someone who 's a builder , you know . \nHe enjoyed the fact that he got to go to MSNBC and take credit essentially for the fact where that the network is where it is today . \nSo at Current , he gets to take on that role again . \nYou know , Current is in what is it , 60 million households have access to it , and there 's not only that , but there 's the Current channel and then there is also the clips that will then go forth to the Internet . \nAnd so Olbermann has been very smart so far in how he deployed himself because he 's got one basic channel -- one basic target , and that 's the Fox News Channel . \nLike , you know , he 's got his , FOK , Friends of Keith , and that 's his target . \nHe has n't really been -- KURTZ : You 're referring to guys that he now assumes on Twitter . \nKURTZ : Let me turn to Matt Lewis , because not only is , as I mentioned at the top , not only is Olbermann going to be the star of Current TV , he 's going be the chief news officer . \nDoes that kind brand this Al Gore founded channel as a left-wing outfit ? \nMATT LEWIS , LEAVING AS A COLUMNIST FOR AOL 'S POLITICSDAILY.COM : I think it might . \nI mean , look , first of all , you talked about the break-up with MSNBC . \nThis struck me as a rebound thing , right , where you ca n't be single for long . \nYou have got to jump into a relationship with the next big thing . \nBut , you 're right , if you look at what Current TV is , it 's left of center , but it 's kind -- it 's like a young network , it 's MTV meets NPR . \nIt 's kind of cool , not overtly political . \nCertainly left of center . \nThis makes it overtly political . \nTo me it makes it a little bit less cool , but I 'm not their target audience probably . \nKURTZ : Speaking of political , before I move on to the next topic . \nYou announced this week that you are leaving AOL Politics Daily and joining Tucker Carlson 's Daily Caller web site , and you said this is because of Arianna Huffington becoming the editor and news director of AOL . \nAnd you called her a far left liberal . \nDid you think she was going to dictate what you write ? \nLEWIS : Well , look , here is the deal . \nIf you 're in the business of making widgets , it does n't really matter who your boss is , because widgets are not ideological , right , you 're working for a paycheck . \nBut when you 're an opinion writer , it matters very deeply , the political philosophy of the editorial department . \nMy thing is , I do not have to work for a conservative outlet , but I will not work for a liberal outlet , and that certainly was a prime consideration for me . \nKURTZ : All right . \nDon Rumsfeld making the rounds this week pushing his book , his version of what happened during his tenure as defense secretary . \nFirst interview was done by ABC 's Diane Sawyer . \nLet 's take a look . \nDONALD RUMSFELD , FORMER DEFENSE SECRETARY : Hillary Clinton , John Kerry , the French intelligence , the British intelligence , the German intelligence . \nIt was uniform across the board that -- that it was reasonable to assume that he had chemical and biological weapons . \nDIANE SAWYER : But you were wrong . \nRUMSFELD : My goodness , the intelligence was certainly wrong . \nSAWYER : If you had known he did not have them -- SAWYER : If you had -- KURTZ : Aaron Barnhart , what did you make of Sawyer and others who tried to pin down the former Pentagon chief on how much he was wrong about Iraq ? \nAnd I 've read his book . \nHe does n't say he was wrong about very much . \nBARNHART : No , it does n't . \nAnd Stephanopoulos probably came closest to nailing him on some points , but -- and I thought Sawyer 's segment was kind of weird because it starts out with his up close and personal thing where we found out about some family tragedy that was going on , which I thought was completely irrelevant to his making a decision to send 4,500 men and women to die in Iraq and Afghanistan . \nAnd it 's been four and a half years since he 's addressed the media , was n't really interested in that . \nYou know , this is part of the -- you know , the legacy of the 1980s and '90s when the big thing was to have a get with an author who is coming out with a brand new book . \nBut in the Internet age , it seems to me like we 've all kind of moved on from that . \nI mean , I would be much more interested in seeing your old colleague , Tom Ricks , who has written a couple of books very critical of Rumsfeld 's management of these wars , engaging him , but of course -- KURTZ : Well , the book leaked out early , as it always does . \nI got a copy , other reports did too . \nBut it 's still I think useful to have somebody put the guy in the chair , cameras rolling , and try to hold him accountable . \nLet me get a break here . \nWhen we come back , Bill O'Reilly 's Super Bowl sit-down with Barack Obama , was the lack of fireworks good for Fox News ? \n-LRB- COMMERCIAL BREAK -RRB- KURTZ : Bill O'Reilly said it would be the most watched interview of all time . \nOK , It was n't . \nBut the setting was fascinating : Barack Obama in the White House on Super Bowl Sunday with one of the most opinionated hosts from the network that his administration had once declared war on . \nSo O'Reilly faced something of a balancing act . \nHere 's a bit of the interview . \nBILL O'REILLY , FOX NEWS ANCHOR : Does it disturb you that so many people hate you ? \nIt 's a serious question . \nOBAMA : You know , the truth is that the people -- and I 'm sure previous presidents would say the same thing , whether it was Bush or Clinton or Reagan or anybody , that the people who dislike you , do n't know you . \nOBAMA : Even -- the folks who hate you , they do n't know you . \nOBAMA : What they hate is whatever funhouse mirror image of you that 's out there . \nKURTZ : Rachel Sklar , O'Reilly took issue with me , saying he did n't put points on board in that interview . \nWell , it was Super Bowl Sunday . \nI used a lot of football metaphors . \nWhat I meant was that this famous aggressive interviewer did n't really get the president off his script . \nWhat was your thoughts ? \nSKLAR : Well , honestly , watching that , my thought was I really wanted to hear Obama speak more . \nO'Reilly interrupted him mid-thought a lot of the time . \nYou know , there have been -- there 's been a lot of criticism , saying that that ... KURTZ : I do n't think it was that bad . \nThere was a lot of back and forth . \nIt was n't like he was cutting him off . \nSKLAR : I had n't seen it ... KURTZ : I have to cut you off now . \nSKLAR : I had n't seen it when it aired , and I -- when it started , I was like , `` Oh , this is n't so bad . '' \nTowards , you know , when they got into the thick of it , he really did . \nHe would interrupt Obama before he had a chance to actually answer the question . \nThat 's just -- that does n't serve the audience . \nThat was actually my overarching thought . \nSKLAR : But I liked the interview . \nKURTZ : Get an overarching thought from Matt Lewis . \nO'Reilly came off as reasonable . \nKURTZ : And as he pointed out a couple days after that , that 's good for FOX , right ? \nLEWIS : I think it is . \nAnd I think there 's a distinction to be made . \nBill O'Reilly , I think , is different than Glenn Beck or Keith Olbermann . \nI think , you know , he certainly can be incendiary , but I think he is also more of a newsman . \nAnd let me say , I kind of disagree with you and Rachel both . \nI thought the interview was fabulous . \nI thought that both President Obama and Bill O'Reilly deserved an A plus . \nAnd I also think ... BLITZER : What was fabulous about it ? \nLEWIS : Well , first of all , you have to interrupt . \nYou have to interrupt people because that is when you get to the real person . \nKURTZ : So by interrupting , what did he get ? \nLEWIS : I think what you saw is the actual President Obama , instead of the talking points , instead of the stuff he rehearsed . \nAnd you know what ? \nI think it was likeable . \nI think when he interrupted and you got to him off message , people probably liked it . \nKURTZ : Aaron Barnhart , O'Reilly does n't usually do live interviews . \nHe tapes his program every night . \nAnd to me he seemed rushed , just a little off his game . \nHow did you see it ? \nBARNHART : Yes , I disagree with that , Howie . \nI thought it was excellent . \nCount me in with Matt on that . \nBARNHART : This was the Bill O'Reilly I remember from 11 , 12 years ago when he was , you know , not the 800-pound gorilla . \nLook , Bill O'Reilly every night has a challenge , which is to find somebody to talk to who 's as formidable and who is as influential and who is as powerful as he is . \nAnd most nights you do n't get it . \nAnd I think that 's led to somewhat of a distortion of his image over the years . \nHere with the president , he has somebody that he can really go mano-a-mano with , and both guys think -- you know , I thought were clearly invigorated by it . \nBARNHART : Look , you know , everywhere else in the world , the head of state expects a vigorous sort of questioning . \nI remember that Irish reporter who , you know , started interrogating President Bush back in the day , and he sort of looked at her this way , because he was not accustomed to that type of treatment from the American press . \nLet me close with one exchange between the -- O'Reilly and the president that I did like . \nLet 's roll that . \nO'REILLY : How much damage do you believe the media is doing by participating in this rancor ? \nAnd people have accused me of that . \nOBAMA : I do n't think it helps . \nAnd the media , unfortunately -- if I have a nice talk with John McCain and we 're agreeing to do something ... KURTZ : That was a good question , and the president is right . \nMatt Lewis , Aaron Barnhart , Rachel Sklar , thanks very much for stopping by . \nUp next , the Gawker article that brought a congressman down . \nWe 'll talk to the reporter who wrote the story . \nKURTZ : I was debating with my staff the other day whether a titillating report by Gawker , the online gossip site , was worth discussing on this program . \nI voted yes , but before we could resolve it , Congressman Christopher Lee settled the matter : he resigned . \nThe married Republican congressman from upstate New York had sent some flirtatious e-mails to a woman on Craigslist , describing himself as a divorced lobbyist . \nThere were also some shirtless photos of himself . \nWell , joining us now from New York , Maureen O'Connor , the Gawker staff writer who broke the story . \nThree and a half hours from the time you posted that piece to Congressman Lee 's resignation . \nDid you surprise you , that he quit and that he quit so quickly ? \nMAUREEN O'CONNOR , GAWKER.COM : It most virtually surprised us , especially that the e-mails we had were relatively tame . \nHe had never actually met this woman . \nThere was no evidence of an actual affair . \nIt was really just a sort of PG-13 embarrassing but ultimately not terribly racy picture and flirtation . \nKURTZ : Something about the online culture I think now that you are -- some cases forced to resign before anything actually happens of this actual nation . \nAnd this woman , and she since identified herself to `` The Washington Post , '' as Yesha Callahan , she just contacted you ? \nWhat was her motivation ? \nWhy did she come to Gawker ? \nO'CONNOR : We received an e-mail in our like tips@gawker.com, our tip line , from somebody . \nAnd it was a brief email that said I had a chance encounter with a congressman , do you want to hear about it ? \nAnd , you know , we almost missed this e-mail because it was so small . \nAnd , so , of course , I said , yes . \nAnd do you have actual proof of this ? \nAnd lo and behold , she actually did . \nShe provided us e-mails that were from the confirmed personal e-mail address of Christopher Lee . \nWe were able to -- his staff confirmed that was his personal e - mail address , after we realized it was the e-mail addressed that he created his personal Facebook account with . \nSo , honestly , the dots were not that hard to connect . \nKURTZ : Did this woman tell you her name ? \nO'CONNOR : I did know the woman 's name and her background , although I did promise her anonymity . \nKURTZ : You did n't push her to go public ? \nBecause , obviously , she decided to go public after the story broke . \nO'CONNOR : No -- well , we worked with her . \nAnd I sort of ca n't go through the details of that . \nO'CONNOR : But I definitely , you know , I knew -- I looked into the identity and background of the person . \nWe , you know , looked over the e-mails and we looked at the digital evidence to prove that it was , in fact , a real correspondence . \nSo , we sort of had that every step of the way and then , of course , Christopher Lee probably is the person that made this the really big story and ultimately proved it was important when he resigned . \nKURTZ : And , importantly , you gave the congressman 's office a chance to resign . \nNow , I worked for `` The Daily Beast . '' \nWe probably would have run the story . \n`` Politico '' might have run this story . \nBut do you think if this woman had contacted , you know , CNN , `` Washington Post , '' `` New York Times , '' `` L.A. Times , '' `` Wall Street Journal , '' that any of these mainstream outlets would have felt comfortable going with a story about some congressman , you know , sending a woman shirtless photos ? \nO'CONNOR : You know , I think it may have been presented differently . \nI mean , what we really do is sort of -- we fill a different niche of reporting essentially . \nWe are a gossip blog . \nAnd whereas , say , a beat report on the Hill could know everybody in Christopher Lee 's staff and they might have sources all over the Hill . \nThis kind of story does not come necessarily from that . \nChristopher Lee was -- it seems like , had a secret double life that he was leading on the Internet . \nSo , what we do is we sort of provide a way for people to -- just regular , private citizens to say , here 's my story and then we reported out from there . \nSo , it 's a little bit of a sort of a different way of getting at what it -- well , it 's ultimately similar because , of course -- I mean , `` The Washington Post '' followed up on this story and they have done plenty of reporting on it after we broke it . \nYou know , `` The New York Times , '' like you said , also went with this story . \nO'CONNOR : So , we certainly were n't the only one . \nThe key phrase is -- after you broke it . \nOf course , after he resigned . \nI got less than a minute . \nI mean , he was not carrying on with a lobbyist or somebody on his staff , from the public payroll . \nThey did n't have sex . \nSo , why is it a story in your view ? \nO'CONNOR : Because it 's interesting . \nI mean -- my job is to find interesting stories , report them out , and then put it out there . \nI did n't tell him to resign . \nI did n't say whether , you know , the degree to which we should freak out about this -- to me , it was here is an interesting story -- that 's remarkable that in this day and age that a congressman is corresponding in this manner . \nThis is the way people meet each other online . \nThis is the way congressmen act when they 're living in D.C. . \nAnd it 's an interesting story . \nAnd that 's why we covered it . \nKURTZ : I ca n't contradict you . \nIt was very interesting story . \nMaureen O'Connor , thanks very much for joining us . \nKURTZ : And still to come on this program , Katie Couric 's future at CBS , a bogus magazine piece about Sarah Palin , and the Angelina Jolie rumors that spread around the world . \nThat 's all next . \nKURTZ : Some musical chairs this week at CBS News . \nSean McManus is out as president of the news division . \nThe son of a legendary sportscaster Jim McKay will return to his other job running CBS Sports . \nThat 's some consolation prize going to Super Bowls and final fours . \nMeanwhile , Jeff Fager , who has made a mark in the last half dozen years as executive producer of `` 60 Minutes '' is the new chairman of CBS News , but he 's not giving up his old job . \nFager will still oversee the news magazine show as well . \nOn this program , a year and half ago , he talked about the awkwardness of succeeding the show 's founding producer , the late Don Hewitt . \nJEFF FAGER , CBS : It was really a tough time . \nI mean , he did n't want to go . \nHe said it at one point , `` I want to die at my desk , '' which was tough for everybody . \nIt took him about a year to really get used to it and probably two years to realize that it was probably a good time , and a good moment for him to step down . \nBut it was difficult . \nAnd you could understand why . \nKURTZ : Now , Fager is facing a huge decision . \nShould Katie Couric stay on as anchor when her contract expires this spring ? \nAnd if not Katie , who ? \n`` The CBS Evening News , '' after all , remains mired in third place . \nA knowledgeable source told me this week that CBS Chairman Les Moonves has sent word to Couric that he wants her to remain in the anchor chair , that 's something less than her $ 15 million a year salary through the 2012 elections . \nIf they strike a deal , that would buy time for both sides while they figure out the future . \nWell , this was a heck of a story , was n't it ? \nSarah Palin , there she goes again . \n`` Us Weekly '' reporting that after Christina Aguilera botched the national anthem at the Super Bowl , Palin said spicy Latin princess should n't get such a gig . \n`` Unemployment is at 9 percent , '' the magazine had Palin telling Sean Hannity , `` Yet we have to suffer through a performance by a foreigner with a poor grasp of the English language . '' \nWell , as the Web site gossip `` Cop '' reported , the whole thing came from a satire piece . \nI 'd say that 's worse than forgetting a few star spangled words . \nAnd get this -- `` London 's Daily Mirror '' had a big scoop and lots of media outlets picked it up . \nAngelina Jolie was going to adopt again , this time a 4-year-old girl from Haiti . \nBut Jolie 's spokesman told me the story is flat wrong and the actress never even met the girl when she visited the country after that devastating earthquake . \nYou know , so much gossip is published about Angelina that some reporters do n't even bother to check . \nWell , that 's it for this edition of RELIABLE SOURCES . \nI 'm Howard Kurtz . \nJoin us again next Sunday morning , 11:00 a.m. Eastern , for another critical look at the media . \n`` STATE OF THE UNION '' with Candy Crowley begins right now . \n"}

{"id": "212", "time": "2011-02-07", "text": "By Shelley DuBois , reporterFebruary 7 , 2011 : 5:46 AM ET FORTUNE -- As the political unrest in Egypt continues , corporate America is watching and holding its breath . \nAlready , many companies with operations in Egypt have had to adjust . \nProcter & Gamble -LRB- PG , Fortune 500 -RRB- , for example , had to close its Cairo facilities and evacuate foreign national employees . \nThe protest is affecting the worldwide commodities markets too -- oil prices spiked to $ 100 this week and have stayed high on the assumption that the conflict in Egypt could disrupt crucial oil transit routs . \nWhile most companies are concerned about the transit routes in and out of the country , several are producing energy in Egypt now . \nThey 're exposed to risk right now , since the consequences of political upheaval are unpredictable , and could possibly reach energy assets far from the protest in Cairo . \nYet , so far , they 're neither overly worried , nor should they be : Things for energy companies working in Egypt are n't bad . \nOne independent , Apache Corp -LRB- APA , Fortune 500 -RRB- , has a large stake in Egypt -- about 21 % of the company 's total assets are there , according to an analyst report by HSBC Global Research . \nApache 's stock took a hit on Thursday dropping by about 4.7 % based on news about the conflict , paired with the company 's decision to shut down its Australian oil fields because of hurricanes there . \nThe conflict in Egypt could of course hurt Apache , but it probably wo n't . \nIf it does , it 's unlikely to damage the company in any lasting way . \nApache is still producing from its assets in Egypt , and therefore still raking in a profit from them . \nWhile that could change , there 's a good chance that the independent oil company will continue production during the upheaval and emerge relatively unscathed . \nIn fact , as is typical in equities , one investor 's panic is another 's opportunity : Several analysts claim that the drop in Apache 's stock price due to concern over Apache 's large stake in Egypt created an opportunity to buy newly undervalued Apache stock . \nApache has over 11 million acres in Egypt that produced over 150,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day during 2009 . \nMost of the Apache 's oil fields are in Egypt 's Western Desert , many , over a hundred miles from the conflict in Cairo . \nWhile national conflict can spread anywhere , the biggest threat to Apache depends on the government . \nApache has ties to the government that 's currently getting overthrown , since its partner in Egyptian projects is a company called the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation , is a national oil company . \nThat does create some risk for the company . \nExperts say that Apache 's worst-case scenario would be that the current government gets overthrown and the new regime would nationlize all of Apache 's assets . \nBut that probably wo n't happen . \nIn times of conflict , `` generally speaking , one of the things most nations want to do is keep the energy flowing , in order to meet its demand , '' says John Kollar , an analyst with HSBC . \nApache is crucial to Egypt , according to a UBS Investment Research report . \nThe company drills half of the wells in the country , employs between 4,000 and 5,000 Egyptians and pays over $ 11 million per day to the national treasury . \nWhoever takes charge of the country probably would n't want to put the brakes on such a key source of energy and income . \nIt 's a basic point , but oil , in general , is extremely profitable . \nRight now , Egyptian oil is still coming out of the ground , which means that Apache will profit . \nIn fact , Apache would have to shut down all production in Egypt for a full three months before seeing any negative impact on its credit quality , says Kollar , which does n't appear likely . \nHe takes a longer-term approach to evaluating a company 's stability . \n`` I 'm not all that worried about the next penny per share , I 'm looking at ten and twenty-year bonds and the company 's ability to pay interest and its level of credit-worthiness . '' \nIn that respect , he says , `` Apache is one of the best independent exploration and production companies from credit-worthiness point of view . '' \nMost big oil companies , in fact , are more resilient than the market would reflect . \nCompanies such as Apache and certainly the major energy companies have a plethora of assets all over the globe . \nIf they need to , they can sell them and spend expend less capital and stay financially solvent . \n`` The market 's reaction is always to shoot first and ask questions later , '' Kollar says . \nBut that 's not the best reflection of the health of energy companies with such long-term contracts that encounter may encounter obstacles but ultimately generate a big profit . \nApache 's stock has started to creep back since it plummeted last week and has kept producing throughout the turmoil . \nEnergy plays everywhere are becoming increasingly risky . \nExploration and production companies are partnering with government-linked oil companies where volatile tax and export rules , if not political conflict , are real possibilities . \nIf the market continues to overreact , then recover , it 'll keep providing investors an opportunity to buy shares of certain energy companies with short-term obstacles and long-term profit plans . \nMarket indexes are shown in real time , except for the DJIA , which is delayed by two minutes . \nAll times are ET . \nDisclaimer LIBOR Warning : Neither BBA Enterprises Limited , nor the BBA LIBOR Contributor Banks , nor Reuters , can be held liable for any irregularity or inaccuracy of BBA LIBOR . \nMorningstar : 2013 Morningstar , Inc. . \nDisclaimer The Dow Jones IndexesSM are proprietary to and distributed by Dow Jones & Company , Inc. and have been licensed for use . \nAll content of the Dow Jones IndexesSM 2013 is proprietary to Dow Jones & Company , Inc. . \nThe market data is the property of Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. and its licensors . \nFactSet Research Systems Inc. 2013 . \nMost stock quote data provided by BATS . \n"}

'' \nThe move was resoundingly denounced by party guests as an overly politically correct move . \nTurns out the song has always been `` Oh My Gosh . '' \nThe game itself saw plenty of touchdown end zone kneeling celebrations , including Green Bay wide receiver Greg Jennings kneeling and bowing his head after catching one of his two touchdown catches . \nAnd there were plenty God shout-outs in post-game coverage . \nA jubilant Jennings repeatedly told Fox 's Pam Oliver , `` To God be the glory . '' \nWhat 's God got to do with the Super Bowl ? \nWell , the Bible prohibits working on the Sabbath , so the game was subject to divine retribution from the start . \nAlso , the Bible prohibits wearing fabric cut from different cloth , as well as shaving , things which many of the fans and players were guilty of . \nCoveting thy neighbor 's wife is also forbidden -LRB- are you listening , Rothlesberger ? -RRB- . \nWe can only hope that no shrimp or BBQ pork were being consumed , since they are Biblically verbotten as well . \nIn fact , it 's amazing the Lord did n't smite the whole heathen spectacle . \nBut He was probably watching the Puppy Bowl anyway . \nJohn 3:16 ... there seems to be another `` controversial '' commercial that is getting passed around as well . \nit actually comments on the very verse of John 3:16 . \nit does n't look like the christians are liking it too much . \nmaybe just a little too much TRUTH for them ??

Get used to it '' ... No issue . \nMy African American relatives can see to the roof tops `` say it loud , I 'm black and I am proud '' ... No issue . \nBoth statement can be proclaimed in the public arena , ... Shamed , as they should be , to those who attempt to say that either groups should not proclaim such . \nBut , y ' all athiest think that we people of faith should do so in private and shame . \nAre you guys and girls actually that narrowminded and believing that you can force any group `` into the closet '' , be they Christians or any group . \nThe moment you pressure one group back into the closet or the privacy of their own homes you are talking of oppression . \nOnce you go down that road goodbye LGBT , any ethinic multiculturalism . \nDo not think it would stop there . \nPossibly because one 's skin color or se-xual orientation are natural , yet have been historically discriminated against . \nYour religion is personal choice . \n@W247 -- If you were offended with the way I said something then I apologize . \nWhether the true age of the earth is known to an exact year is debatable but it can not be said that just because we do not know the exact age that anything is possible . \nWith radiometric age dating it clearly can be shown that the age of the earth as referred to in the Bible is incorrect . \nI guess every Christian I have talked to believes in the earth being relatively young but I should not paint you with this broad brush since you may have a different take on this matter . \nAlso I have only recently begun studying the bible as I stated above but where does it talk about dinosaurs and what exactly does it say ? \nI have never heard of this before and it interests me a great deal , thank you for pointing it out , cheers . \n@W247 -- maybe you should come talk to those who ring my bell then . \nWe have asked repeatedly for them to stop and have a no soliciting sign but that does n't stop them because they say it is their goal to spread the good word . \nAlso not all Christians or Christian faith groups have the same beliefs or religious culture . \nI would not ever speak on behalf of all Sikhs of the world because even within the faith there are many different types of people , with different views and beleifs and how they interept what is written , told or passed on to them so how you would possibly know whether someone should be in church or not and at what time is beyond me . \nYou tell me that you have been studying the the age of the earth yet you have no response or conclusion except to ask me what I have come up with . \nThe Guru Granth Sahib is the Sikhs holy book and speaks of this , pick it up and take a read and broaden your mind , I am in the process of reading the Bible , have read passages of the Koran as well . \nThe Sikhs holy book is the only one I know of that speaks about dinosaurs , space and time travel , multipile universes along with being good to others , peaceful living , hardwork , respect and faith that good will prevail . \n@well read -- you are absolutley right , you should just believe what is written in the bible and run with it . \nMaybe i 'm just naive or a product of the teachings my parents passed on to me but I was taught to question everything and constantly learn and grow , this again is also written in the Guru Granth Sahib and to never get stagnant and always expand your mind , body and soul . \nAlso notice I did not say how old the earth was I just stated that the Bible is wrong and this obvious mistake or lie has not been acknowledged by those who follow blindly . \nYou just assumed that I went with what certain scientists have stated . \n@GSA : since you did not state , and seemed to be reasonably minded , I did ask you what your base was for the age of the Earth . \nAnd that is a little bit belittling to tell me to go `` broaden my mind '' . \nI did not tell what , where , how , who I have been studying with . \nHowever I do not expect an apology from you . \nYes , the bible does talk about dinosaurs and I am glad that are also a student and willing to read it for yourself . \nI hope you do so with an open mind . \nFebruary 8 , 2011 at 4:27 pm | Report abuse | Roger Goldleader writes : `` Americans worship regularly at the TV altar , and the lust of the eyes , the lust of the flesh , and the pride of life are all `` nourished '' by what oozes out of our TV god . \nThat is the religion being shoved down our throats actually , we just eat it all up because it feeds our notions of self sufficiency . \nWe love everything that enables us to believe that we ourselves are god . \nSo to have a player say , `` to God be the glory '' is the EXCEPTION TO THE RULE .

'' \nThe reality is that the Christian world would have a conniption fit . \nYet when a Christian does the EXACT same thing -LRB- except including God -RRB- , then it is perfectly fine . \nNone of that even begins to address the fact that these men are playing a violent game -LRB- Jesus was n't running around playing violent games -RRB- , living in multi-million dollar mansions -LRB- while Jesus was poor -RRB- , working on Sunday -LRB- when the Bible says to keep the Sabbath holy -RRB- , intentionally abusing and destroying the body and brain that God gave them -LRB- due to the abuse that is the NFL game -RRB- , etc , etc , etc. . \nGood thing there is no hypocrisy there . \nI support people having their own religious preferences , but they do n't need to shove it down everyone 's throat every single time that the opportunity arises . \nMay I note that the entire spectacle of professional sports , of which the Super Bowl seems to be the preeminent event , along with the attendant advertisements , glitz , self-worship , and idolotry all loudly proclaim `` there is no God and I congratulate myself and my hard work for winning ! '' \nAmericans worship regularly at the TV altar , and the lust of the eyes , the lust of the flesh , and the pride of life are all `` nourished '' by what oozes out of our TV god . \nThat is the religion being shoved down our throats -- actually , we just eat it all up because it feeds our notions of self sufficiency . \nWe love everything that enables us to believe that we ourselves are god . \nSo to have a player say , `` to God be the glory '' is the EXCEPTION TO THE RULE . \nFebruary 8 , 2011 at 8:21 am | Report abuse | dear `` the truth '' Mormons do n't go door to door ... that 's a Jehovah 's Witness ... get your facts straight before you run your mouth . \nFebruary 8 , 2011 at 9:17 am | Report abuse | Do you know why we `` shove Christianity in your face '' ? \nBecause we care about your soul . \nWhich is more important , your comfort zone , or the Biblical truth of Heaven and Hell ? \nI wonder how many people sports fans , movie stars , politicians , and every-day joes , are in Hell right now , talking about the experience they had at the Superbowl ? \nI wonder still how many of them are saying , `` Why did n't I listen when my co-worker , friend , parent , etc. . . \ntold me about the Good News of Jesus Christ .

'' \n\\*\\*\\* TO claims to be a Christian . \nBack when he was with the Eagles -LRB- one of his most disruptive stints -RRB- , he was even quoted as saying , It doesn t matter what the doctor said . \nI have the best doctor in God . '' \n\\*\\*\\* `` The example of someone thanking the fact that there is no God is obtuse , and not actually the opposite of someone thanking God . '' \n\\*\\*\\* Fine , I can play along ... so what if someone after the game thanks Satan for helping them win the game ? \nAfter all , according to the Bible itself , God killed FAR more people than Satan . \nMost people are shocked to learn about how many people the devil actually killed . \nIn the Bible , the number of SPECIFIC references to the number of people that God killed is in excess of 2.3 Million . \nNone of that even accounts for abstract events such as `` the flood , '' then that number is likely in excess of 30 Million people . \nAnd how many people has the devil killed ? \nThe answer is 10 . \nNot 10 Million , not 10 Thousand , but rather 10 . \nThat 's 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 . \nEven more ironic is that the 10 people that he killed were in a `` bet '' of sorts with God with regard to Job and his family , so God was directly implicated in those as well . \nSo looking at the final specific tally that is most favorable to God , it is : Do n't shoot the messenger ... I 'm only reporting what the Bible says . \n\\*\\*\\* `` Thanking God is like thanking anyone else for a gift you received . '' \n\\*\\*\\* If they want to thank God , by all means let them do so as much as they 'd like ... in PRIVATE . \nIf they are on the Christian News Network , then let them thank God all they want there as people can then tune it to see it where the format is appropriate . \nIn fact , Jesus even speaks about not drawing attention to yourself : From Matthew : `` And when you pray , do not be like the hypocrites , for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by men . \nI tell you the truth , they have received their reward in full . \nBut when you pray , go into your room , close the door and pray to your Father , who is unseen . \nThen your Father , who sees what is done in secret , will reward you . '' \nWhy are n't Christians\\/Catholics spending that hour out helping the needy instead of wasting that hour trying to look and feel good about themselves in Church ? \nPeople go to Church for their own reasons , not because of what Jesus tells them to do as evidenced above . \nAs an aside , Jackson Browne has a great song called `` The Rebel Jesus . '' \nCheck out the lyrics . \n\\*\\*\\* `` If a person believes there is no God , then it 's like they bought it themselves ... no need to thank anything . \nSo thanking `` the fact that there is no God '' would actually have to be them going out of their way to make a dig at those who believe in God . '' \n\\*\\*\\* So let 's be blatantly honest here ... the reason why these people are thanking God in droves is to draw attention to themselves and to draw attention to the general population that they believe there is a God . \nThus , someone saying that to the general population that they believe that there is n't a God really is n't much different . \n\\*\\*\\* `` Yes , there are those evangelicals who would have you believe you are a terrible person if you are not Christian , who will hate you and claim you are the scourge of the earth those are the people that protest gay soldiers ' funerals and things like that ... and those people are wrong . '' \n\\*\\*\\* I can not begin to tell you how refreshing it is to hear a person of faith make a statement like that . \nThere need to be a lot more people like yourself speaking out about items such as that . \nSincere kudos to you ! \n\\*\\*\\* `` But by and large , those ads are done by Christians who believe they have found a good thing and want to share it ... much the same as I tell every high school student I meet how great the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill was for me . \nIt 's up to them to decide if it would be good for them , too , but I feel obligated to share . '' \nTake Tim Tebow for a second here . \nI am actually a big Tebow fan . \nHis religious stance is obviously well known and it is rather annoying to constantly hear about it when I 'm trying to watch football and not feel like I am in church . \nWith that said , I GREATLY admire Tim for standing up for his beliefs . \nAnd I admire him for that because he is n't a hypocrite about it and actually practices first hand what he preaches . \nTim 's SuperBowl ad was APPROVED by the NFL last year which was a pro-life ad . \nAnd he did the ad tastefully without throwing around words like abortion , the Bible and Christianity left and right . \nWell , I can support you 100 % there !!! Your post was a very `` Christian '' type of response on your part , so I commend you for that . \nIn an odd way , you remind me of myself at one point in time in my life when I too used to believe . \nSince then I have expanded my horizons and looked at the situation from a logical perspective . \nI am not ruling out the possibility of a Supreme Being , just ruling out that a Supreme Being had anything to do with writing the Bible -LRB- as I 'd then have to believe that the Supreme Being is a simpleton if he had a hand in writing the Bible due to the countless errors contained within -RRB- . \nThe Bible is littered with errors , contradictions and prophecies that never came to pass . \nIn fact it contradicts itself starting in THE VERY FIRST TWO CHAPTERS of Genesis when the order of creation is mixed up to having only 2 of the 4 Gospel writers bothering to talk about the birth of Jesus -LRB- and those two accounts conflict with each other while also providing timelines which make it impossible for Jesus to have been born based on their accounts -RRB- to 3 of the 4 Gospel writers not agreeing on what the final words of Jesus were . \nIf I saw the Son of God die right in front me , I think I 'd remember his last words verbatim ... would n't you ? \nThe facts are that a 5th grader today knows more about the world that we live in than did the uneducated people who wrote the Bible . \nIt is ironic that everyone here would NEVER let a 5th grader dictate the course of your life , but when it comes to the Bible , then it all of the sudden `` magically '' becomes OK to do so . \nIn any event , I 'd encourage you to keep an open mind because I am exponentially MUCH happier being freed from the guilt and constraints of organized religion than I was before . \nJust because I do n't have a `` Christian '' label attached to me does n't mean that I ca n't still do good works on my own . \nIn the end , I can simply follow the Golden Rule ... `` Do unto others as you would want them to do unto you . '' \nInterestingly enough , that exists in almost every religion and since God 's people encompass the planet , that makes far more sense than relying on a 2,000 year old book written by uneducated men and a corrupt machine that is organized religion to rule my life : Bah ' Faith : `` And if thine eyes be turned towards justice , choose thou for thy neighbor that which thou choosest for thyself . '' \nBrahmanism : Do naught unto others which would cause you pain if done to you . '' \nBuddhism : `` Hurt not others in ways that you yourself would find hurtful . '' \nConfucianism : `` Do not do to others what you do not want them to do to you . '' \nEgyptian : `` Do for one who may do for you , that you may cause him thus to do . '' \nHinduism : `` This is the sum of duty : do not do to others what would cause pain if done to you . '' \nHumanism : `` Do n't do things you would n't want to have done to you . '' \nIslam : `` None of you truly believes until he wishes for his brother what he wishes for himself . '' \nJainism : `` In happiness and suffering , in joy and grief , we should regard all creatures as we regard our own self . '' \nJudaism : `` What is hateful to you , do not to your fellow man . \nThis is the law : all the rest is commentary . '' \nNative American : `` Do not wrong or hate your neighbor . \nFor it is not he who you wrong , but yourself . '' \nShinto : `` The heart of the person before you is a mirror . \nSee there your own form . '' \nSikhism : `` No one is my enemy , none a stranger and everyone is my friend . '' \nTaoism : `` Regard your neighbor 's gain as your own gain , and your neighbor 's loss as your own loss . '' \nYoruba : `` One going to take a pointed stick to pinch a baby bird should first try it on himself to feel how it hurts . '' \nZoroastrianism : `` Whatever is disagreeable to yourself do not do unto others . '' \nIn the end , it is obvious that all religions share this theme . \nThat is the rule to follow , not because it is in some book , but because it is shared across religions and humanity . \nIf you were born in Tibet or Iran , you 'd still be following that rule . \nLogic dictates this is FAR more sensible . \nIn any event , best wishes to you . \nExcellent response by you to @Lydia . \np.s.

\nGod IS an underachiever . \nLook at these bad designs . \nWhen we study the retina at the back of the eye , we can see that the cell layers are backwards . \nLight has to travel thru seven layers of cells before reaching the light sensing cells . \nThen the signals go back thru these layers to the nerves on the inside surface . \nIn addition , the blood vessels are on the inside surface and further block the light . \nA truly intelligent designer could have done better than the human eye . \nActually , evolution did a better job with the eyes of birds -LRB- which have no blood vessels in the retina -RRB- and the octopus and squid -LRB- which have the light sensing cells on the surface -RRB- . \nIn fact , vision is so useful for survival that eyes have evolved independently at least twenty separate times , with at least a dozen different designs . \nHumans and other animals have many more examples of sub-optimal or bad design . \nHere are a few : One of the worst designs in mammals is the nerve for the larynx , called the recurrent laryngeal nerve . \nIt is much longer than it needs to be going from the brain into the chest , around the aorta , and back up to the larynx . \nIn humans it 's about three feet too long , but in giraffes it 's about fifteen feet longer than needed . \nThe human pelvis slopes forward , which was useful for our knuckle-walking ancestors . \nThe only reason that we can walk upright is because we have an incredible sharp bend at the base of our spines -LRB- which is the source for so much low back pain -RRB- . \nThe human baby 's skull is too big , such that many women painfully die in childbirth if they do n't get modern medicine Evidence of evolutionThe extreme detour of this nerve in giraffes -LRB- fifteen feet farther than the direct route of a designer -RRB- is cited as evidence of evolution as opposed to intelligent design . \n-LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- edit -RRB- References1 . \n^ Dawkins , Richard -LRB- 2009 -RRB- . \nHistory written all over us '' . \nThe greatest show on Earth . \nNew York : Free Press . \nRetrieved November 21 , 2009 . \nScience need only show lack of intelligence in nature 's designs , the human frame being a prime example . \nOne 's frame is certainly close enough to the individual voter and contains obvious design defects easily explained by evolution but embarrassing for IDers . \n-LRB- 1 -RRB- Our pelvis slopes forward for knuckle dragging like all the great apes . \nOnly by an extremely sharp bend of our spine can we stand erect : an evolutionary artifact or a design weakness obvious to any first-year engineering student ? \n-LRB- 2 -RRB- Our mouths have too many teeth : either the result of an evolutionarily flattened mammalian muzzle or a design plan that could n't count accurately above twenty ? \n-LRB- 3 -RRB- Our facial bones are squashed by an expanded brain case to produce a sinus drainage system that would embarrass the local plumber : evolution or just plain stupid design ? \nSo I say THANK YOU GOD , YOU ARE AWESOME . ? \nA note about the children god `` gives '' us : Psalm 127:3 Children are a gift of the LORD Notice how god does n't check to see if a woman is capable of raising a child , before he gives a baby to them ? \nWomen in poor countries bear children , only to have them die , because Mom has no food . \nWomen addicted to drugs are given babies , when they are totally incapable of taking care of themselves , much less a child . \nGirls are blessed with a baby they do n't want . \nWhy are babies given to women who do n't want them ? \nIf god would be more careful with giving out gifts\\/children , abortion would n't be needed . \nYour god is not awesome . \nYou just use selective observation . \nThe reason there are all these bad things in the world is because we disobeyed God . \nGod is n't the underacheiver , we are . \nEvil people enjoying long lives ?

{"id": "55", "time": "2011-02-07", "text": "Egypt Standoff Continues ; Hosni Mubarak 's Fortune Aired February 7 , 2011 - 18:00 ET THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT . \nWOLF BLITZER , CNN ANCHOR : Deb Feyerick , thanks very much . \nAnd to our viewers , you 're in THE SITUATION ROOM . \nHappening now : a death in Egypt and the video that went viral around the world . \nWe have tracked down the woman who taped it , and they share -- they share their chilling story with us , the woman -- women , I should say , who found it . \nAlso , the billionaire president . \nIf Hosni Mubarak leaves his poverty-stricken country , will his fortune go with him ? \nAnd journalists recounting their nightmare in an Egyptian jail and the screams of beating victims that still haunt them . \nWe have breaking news , political headlines and Jeanne Moos all straight ahead . \nI 'm Wolf Blitzer . \nYou 're in THE SITUATION ROOM . \nWe 're following all the latest developments this hour in Egypt , where the standoff continues , with protesters insisting they wo n't leave Cairo 's Liberation Square until Hosni Mubarak goes . \nBut President Mubarak is n't budging either . \nOur senior international correspondent - , Nic Robertson , is joining us now from Cairo . \nHe 's joining us live . \nFirst of all , Nic , a leading Google executive picked up by Egyptian police almost two weeks ago has now been released . \nWe just got the tweet from Google , a huge relief . \nWael Ghonim has been released . \nOur love to him and his family . \nTell us what we know about this . \nNIC ROBERTSON , CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : Well , when he was released as well everybody became aware of it when he treated , `` Freedom is blessed . '' \nAnd that was really the indication that he was out of jail after 12 days in detention . \nHe was last tweeting on his way to Tahrir Square the 26th of January , one day after the big protests began . \nAnd now he 's been freed . \nHe 's been freed with the help of the new head of the National Democratic Party here , who is seen as a reformer . \nBut such is the feeling of Mr. Wael -- of Wael Ghonim is that he said , I wo n't be happy until this man has left that office . \nHe believes that the National Democratic Party , the party of Hosni Mubarak , should be finished and should be ended . \nSo clearly 12 days in government lockup has done nothing to take the edge off of what he feels . \nBut he gave a very emotional interview on local television here . \nHe was in tears at one point . \nHe has revealed that he was the site administrator behind the Facebook page that helped drive and generate this 100,000 signatures of people who would come out and join the protests on January the 25th , when everything began . \nAnd he was crying because he said , I did n't want word to come out of this while I was in jail . \nHe said , I did n't want to be -- I did n't want to appear as a hero . \nThis is the work of the youth , the youth on the Internet in Egypt , so a very emotional moment , but the realization of a lot of people that this senior Google executive who has been locked up here by the government for the past 12 days has played a major , major role in helping organize this -- the demonstrations on the 25th of January that have led to everything else we have seen since -- Wolf . \nBLITZER : Yes , it 's encouraging , although I suspect there are still others being detained by Egypt 's secret police . \nYou are now in Cairo . \nNic , you were in Alexandria . \nWe were watching and listening to your riveting reports from Alexandria last week . \nYou have got some fresh eyes now Cairo . \nGive us your impression of what 's going on in Cairo right now on this day , lots of uncertainty still . \nROBERTSON : You have sort of tighter checkpoints around the city than ever than were two or three weeks ago . \nBut the other thing that you notice now is this country is sort of picking up a more normal rhythm . \nThere are lines at the banks . \nPeople have been going to the gas stations . \nThe roads are busy . \nOne of the things about Cairo that I have heard from -- from my CNN colleagues is that while all the trouble has been going on , the roads have been relatively empty . \nWell , we drove back in to the city today down busy highways from Alexandria and the roads are jammed in the middle of Cairo . \nSo , Cairo away from Tahrir Square is -- really feels as if it 's picking up and you do get the sense that this is getting into a long-term dialogue stalemate , standoff between the government and the protesters at the moment . \nAnd , meanwhile , a large percentage of the rest of the population here is really going back to work , as we have seen , and getting on with their daily lives , Wolf . \nBLITZER : Nic , thanks very much . \nWe will check back with you . \nHosni Mubarak is n't just Egypt 's president . \nHe 's also one of the world 's wealthiest men , amassing a fortune while he has ruled a country racked by poverty . \nAnd that raises this serious question . \nWhen and if he goes , what happens to all that money ? \nLisa Sylvester is here . \nShe 's looking into this . \nI got a lot of tweets on Twitter , at my Twitter account , WolfBlitzerCNN , over the past week : Check into the money . \nFollow the money , Mubarak 's money . \nA lot of outrage , Egyptians especially . \nSo , we asked to you take a closer look and tell us what you discovered . \nLISA SYLVESTER , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Yes , this is an issue that certainly has resonated with a lot of people . \nThey have a lot of questions . \nAnd we got to say we do n't know exactly how much Mubarak has in bank accounts , real estate and other investments , but we do know that President Hosni Mubarak and his two sons are all billionaires . \nAnd now , as you mentioned , Wolf , the question is if , and it 's a big if , but if he steps down , what happens to his personal fortune ? \nSYLVESTER -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Protesters gathering outside a home in London owned by son Gamal Mubarak not only want to see the family guy . \nThey want billions they allege the Mubarak family stole from the country . \nAcademic experts who have studied the Mubarak regime for decades say along with money tucked away in Swiss and British bank accounts , Mubarak and his two sons reportedly own sprawling mansions , penthouses and vacation homes . \nAMANEY JAMAL , PRINCETON UNIVERSITY : The portfolios themselves are not probably all in Hosni Mubarak 's name . \nThey 're scattered across several countries . \nYou -- I think if you are not his personal accountant at this time , it 's really hard to really know where things stand . \nSYLVESTER -LRB- on camera -RRB- : According to Princeton University Professor Jamal and other prominent Middle Eastern experts , Mubarak 's net worth is estimated to be between $ 25 billion to $ 40 billion , and it could be as high as $ 75 billion . \nTo put that into context , the average Egyptian 's income is only about $ 6,200 . \nAnd one-fifth of the country , according to the United Nations , makes only about $ 1 a day . \n-LRB- voice-over -RRB- : That 's part of what 's fueling all of the rage you see on the streets . \nMICHAEL RUBIN , RESIDENT SCHOLAR , AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE : Well , the question of Hosni Mubarak 's assets is a real time bomb . \nRight now , the Egyptians just want Hosni Mubarak out . \nWhat worries me is that any of these political factions are going to try to play the nationalist card . \nThey 're going to try to do that by determining a wedge issue . \nAnd a safe wedge issue is repatriating Hosni Mubarak 's money . \nSYLVESTER : Now , we reached out to the Egyptian Embassy asking for a response , but they have yet to get back with us . \nAnd one of the reasons why they -- the Mubarak family was able to amass such a fortune is because Egyptian laws are actually written in a way to financially favor the current regime , Wolf . \nEven if it 's only -- only -- $ 25 billion , this is an individual who was an air force commander . \nThen he became vice president under Anwar Sadat . \nAnd then he took over , became president after Sadat was assassinated . \nSo he amassed billions and billions of dollars in a personal fortune while he served as president of Egypt ; is that what I 'm hearing ? \nSYLVESTER : That 's right . \nAnd now people want to know where that money is , but tracking it down may be difficult . \nAnd there 's this whole question , is this actually illegal ? \nAnd I asked the Professor Jamal with Princeton University that question . \nShe said that 's a little bit tricky because , keep in mind , they did have Egyptian laws on the books which actually allowed the regime to amass this current fortune , which , as you said , on the low end , $ 25 billion , on the high end , possibly $ 40 billion , even -- possibly even $ 70 billion , one report said . \nLisa , thanks very , very much . \nAll right , let 's go to Jack . \nPresidential approval ratings , Jack , I take it that is on your mind right now . \nJACK CAFFERTY , CNN ANCHOR : Among other things , correct . \nPresident Obama has the most polarized approval ratings for a second-year president since Dwight Eisenhower . \nA new Gallup Poll shows 81 percent of Democrats , 13 percent of Republicans approved of the job Mr. Obama was doing as president during his second year in office . \nThis 68-point gap is up from a 65-point gap during President Obama 's first year . \nThat also was a record . \nRonald Reagan and Bill Clinton are the only other presidents who had gaps of at least 50 points between party approvals by their second year in office . \nNow , this is n't to say that Mr. Obama is the most polarizing president ever . \nThat award goes to President George W. Bush . \nHe had three years in office with a gap in party ratings that topped 70 points . \nBut Bush 's earlier years in office were less polarizing mostly due to the widespread support he got right after the 9\\/11 attacks . \nAs for President Obama , he arrived in Washington full of talk about unity and bipartisanship . \nAnd his initial approval ratings were among the highest for any post-World War II president . \nBut he quickly lost most of the Republican support , while maintaining high marks from Democrats . \nIt 's worth pointing out , too , that this just is n't about President Obama . \nOur country seems to get more polarized every year on just about everything . \nOn average , nearly all of the presidents since Reagan have more polarized ratings than those that came before Reagan . \nAnd we can probably thank hyper-partisan news on cable , the Internet , and talk radio for some of the growing divide . \nAnyhoo , here 's the question : Why is President Obama such a polarizing figure ? \nGive us your thoughts . \nBLITZER : Jack , thank you . \nA living nightmare in an Egyptian jail . \nWe 're going to hear from journalists from around the world who were detained and are now haunted by what they saw and heard while in an Egyptian jail . \nAlso , lots of questions about the evolving U.S. policy on Egypt and the unrest . \nWe 're going to put some of those questions to the State Department spokesman , P.J. Crowley . \nHe 's live here in THE SITUATION ROOM . \nAnd Sarah Palin is speaking out about Egypt as well -- details of what she 's saying and who she is criticizing . \nBLITZER : When Egyptian authorities started detaining journalists from around the world , the government inadvertently shined a spotlight on the country 's notorious jails and the chilling abuses that happen inside . \nCNN 's Brian Todd is working this part of the story for us . \nAnd it 's chilling , indeed , Brian . \nWhat are you learning ? \nBRIAN TODD , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Wolf , many of the journalists who have been treated the worst are those from Egyptian news services or other Arab outlets . \nAs for the others , some are just now getting the chance to describe their detention after spending days trying to get to safety . \nTODD -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : They have been beaten , harassed , threatened and now some journalists are giving the first real detail of their experiences in Egyptian custody . \nTwo print reporters have written an account of their detention after they were stopped at a checkpoint in Cairo . \n-LRB- on camera -RRB- : I 'm on the phone Souad Mekhennet from `` The New York Times . '' \nShe and her colleague Nicholas Kulish were detained during the height of the unrest by the Egyptian secret police . \nWe are asked not to reveal her location out of concern for her security . \nSouad , can you tell us , when you were taken to the secret police facility , were you blindfolded , were you mistreated ? \nSOUAD MEKHENNET , `` THE NEW YORK TIMES '' : No , at the beginning we were not blindfolded . \nWe were -- actually it was the army who handed us over to the intelligence service . \nAnd what happened then was that someone from the intelligence service asked the army officer to leave , and they started to search our luggage and our stuff . \nAnd then my colleague , Nicholas Kulish , and I were taken for interrogation separately . \nWe were in two separate rooms . \nTODD -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Mekhennet and Kulish write about hearing dull whacks and screams for much of the night . \nAt one point , Mekhennet says she could hear the jailers speaking to a man who she believes had been in Tahrir Square . \nMEKHENNET : The people told him , well , you 're a traitor . \nYou were -- you talked to journalists and you spoke badly about your country . \nAnd the man answered , no , I love my country and I just wanted to tell the truth . \nAnd we could hear how they were beating him up and how he was screaming . \nTODD : Mekhennet says she and her colleagues were not physically abused , but during her interrogation , she had a question for an official . \nMEKHENNET : After half-an-hour , I asked him , I said , well , I would like to know , where are we ? \nAnd he said , you are nowhere , and was smiling . \nTODD : They were released the next morning . \nSeparately , officials from Radio Free Europe tell us two of their journalists had a very similar experience , and one of them was beaten . \nFRANK SMYTH , COMMITTEE TO PROTECT JOURNALISTS : Clearly the government is attempting to eliminate witnesses to the unrest that is occurring on the streets of Cairo , Alexandria and elsewhere . \nIt is clearly a government policy to try and silence the press . \nTODD : We tried several times to reach officials at the Egyptian Embassy in Washington to respond to these specific accounts . \nDespite our repeated calls and e-mails , we have heard nothing back . \nNow , in recent days , the Egyptian ambassador to the U.S. has called the overall treatment of journalists deplorable -- Wolf . \nBLITZER : It was -- certainly was deplorable . \nLet 's talk a little bit about what 's happening right now , Brian . \nAre you seeing any evidence that Egypt 's security forces are changing their policies right now ? \nAre they easing up ? \nTODD : Not really easing up , Wolf , but they 're kind of changing the way they are approaching journalists on the streets . \nNow , this is according to the Committee to Protect Journalists , which says that in recent days , Egyptian forces in some cases have tried to prevent journalists from even getting to the streets , detaining them , forcing them to stay in their hotel rooms , taking away their credentials . \nAnd they have also told us that right now , it 's the Egyptian military , rather than the plainclothes police , that are most responsible for detaining journalists , confiscating their equipment . \nSo that tactic has shifted from the secret police in plainclothes to the military now doing it . \nThat 's according to the Committee to Protect Journalists . \nBLITZER : We applaud , of course , all the journalists who are risking their lives right now under dangerous circumstances to bring us the news . \nBrian , thanks very , very much . \nThey 're among the most disturbing images to come out of the uprising until now . \nWe 're about to hear from the woman who recorded a death in Egypt . \nAnd a former U.S. president suddenly cancels an overseas trip . \nWas it because of possible legal action ? \nBLITZER : A death in Egypt caught on tape and a video that went viral around the world . \nWe are going to get the story behind it from the women who recorded it . \nAlso , Sarah Palin slamming the Obama administration and the president himself over the crisis in Egypt -- details of what she is saying . \nAnd when does the U.S. think President Hosni Mubarak should go ? \nShould it be in September ? \nShould it be earlier ? \nI will ask that and more questions to the State Department spokesman , P.J. Crowley . \nHe 's standing by live right here in THE SITUATION ROOM . \nBLITZER : We want to warn our viewers that the next story contains some disturbing images of a death in Egypt and the equally disturbing story behind it . \nOnce again , here is CNN senior international correspondent Nic Robertson . \nROBERTSON -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : It is 2:28 in the afternoon January 28 . \nThis man is walking to his death . \nThe video went viral , but we wanted to know more . \nWho was he and who recorded his last moments ? \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : We were like , what the hell is he doing ? \nHe should n't be doing this , because the situation does n't look that good . \nROBERTSON : Speaking out for the first time , two young women who videoed the killing . \nThey 're afraid to be identified . \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : He did nothing . \nHe was -- he had nothing . \nHe was like , I have nothing in my hands . \nROBERTSON -LRB- on camera -RRB- : He had nothing in his hands ? \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : Yes . \nAnd he was doing that in the video . \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : Even he did n't have stones or something like the other protesters . \nSo , it was not a -- he was not a threat . \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : This is when they started shooting the tear ... ROBERTSON : Ah , the tear gas . \n-LRB- voice-over -RRB- : They show me photographs they took from the same balcony . \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : You can see here an injured man . \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : They were like putting him on a lowering -- or on a truck to take him to hospital . \nROBERTSON -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : In the hour before the man is shot , the streets around their building become a battleground , rock-throwing protesters facing off with police . \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : These were the police . \nROBERTSON -LRB- on camera -RRB- : And here you can -- we have got riot shields , batons here . \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : I think he 's here throwing the rocks that the protesters are throwing at ... ROBERTSON : Yes , as he is bending -- the policeman here is bending down to pick up a rock . \n-LRB- on camera -RRB- : No , that 's a proper gun . \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : Yes . \nI think it 's a proper gun . \nROBERTSON : It is a proper gun , yes , a rifle . \nAnd he 's pointing it at the protesters . \nROBERTSON -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Not long after , the man begins his walk up the street . \n-LRB- on camera -RRB- : What it appears on the videotape is that he 's standing on one corner , and the gunmen are literally just across the road . \nIs that what -- that 's what ... ROBERTSON : So they were just , what , a few yards away from him ? \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : Yes , not that far , a few yards . \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : They -- the man shot him first , but it did n't get through -- through him . \nBut the second one , I think he -- he zoomed in his face because he was like standing like that . \nAnd ... ROBERTSON : So the man who shot him took very careful aim ? \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : Yes . \nROBERTSON -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : When we go to the same street corner today , it 's still tense , so we use a tiny camera . \n-LRB- on camera -RRB- : This is where the man was standing when he was shot . \nThe gunman was just across ... -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Our hidden camera breaks up as I count the paces across the road . \n-LRB- on camera -RRB- : Seven , eight , nine , 10 , 11 , oh , about 12 paces away , about 12 yards away . \nHe had a clear line of sight , an unobstructed view of his target just over there . \n-LRB- voice-over -RRB- : What the women 's cell phone camera does n't show so well is the crowd cheering him on . \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : The protesters got encouraged , because he was standing right there , and they did n't do anything , the -- the police . \nSo , they were encouraged . \nSo , they were about to go there to him and protest . \nAnd that 's why they shot him . \nROBERTSON : They tell me they hold President Mubarak and the police responsible . \nThey want justice for the man whose name they still do n't know . \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : I feel sympathy to him , his family . \nI do n't know . \nI just feel like I need to get back his rights . \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : I would like for his rights to get back . \nFor him and his family , you know ? \nHe did nothing for it . \nIt 's so unfair . \nROBERTSON : The neighbor videoed the body being carried away by other protesters . \nIn the chaos , no record of where he went . \nNic Robertson , CNN , Alexandria , Egypt . \nBLITZER : Let 's bring in State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley . \nThat 's a disturbing , disturbing story . \nIs the U.S. government familiar with this particular case ? \nP.J. CROWLEY , STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN : I ca n't say that we are . \nIt 's entirely possible our embassy is . \nIt 's a dramatic and powerful and disturbing video . \nThat 's why the president said last night that Egypt can not go back to its old ways . \nThe suppression of the people is the thing of the past . \nThey now have to move forward and construct a different relationship . \nBLITZER : Have you seen any evidence that they -- you 've been saying that for years , the State Department has for decades , and we have n't seen any change . \nCROWLEY : But there is a different dynamic in the Middle East , and there 's a clear opportunity here for both the government and the people to move in a different direction . \nThere are meetings going on . \nThere 's some contacts between the government and official figures . \nThat has to broaden . \nMost importantly this process has to yield concrete actions that convince the Egyptian people that change is on the way . \nBLITZER : Well , have you seen any evidence over the past few days that change is on the way ? \nCROWLEY : It 's early in the process and there 's much more that the government needs to do . \nBLITZER : So the answer is no ? \nCROWLEY : Well , but look at what the military did last week , in standing between various reporting factions . \nSo the government is beginning ... BLITZER : Forget about the military . \nWhat about the police ? \nCROWLEY : The police have been responsible for some very significant violence . \nThe military stepped in to help stabilize the situation . \nBut clearly the government has to do more . \nClearly , the government has to take concrete actions that lead to ... BLITZER : Are you confident that they -- are you confident that they will let journalists , not just American journalists , but journalists around the world , including from the Arab world , do their job ? \nCROWLEY : We 've made that clear to the Egyptian government at the highest levels from the president to the secretary on down that this kind of attacks on journalists and other citizens ... CROWLEY : It has to stop . \nBLITZER : But I guess let me just repeat the question . \nBLITZER : That 's a fair answer . \nDo you want President Mubarak to stay in office until the next scheduled elections in September ? \nCROWLEY : You know , it 's not important what we think . \nIt 's important what the Egyptian ... BLITZER : It 's very important what the United States government thinks . \nCROWLEY : Wolf , these are decisions to be made in Egypt . \nThere is a process under way , and it will be -- and we 're not going to dictate what roles particular peer -LRB- ph -RRB- persons ... CROWLEY : ... including President Mubarak . \nBLITZER : I 'm confused what the president wants right now as far as President Mubarak , because I heard the special envoy , Frank Wisner , a retired U.S. diplomat , say he wants President Mubarak to stay until September . \nCROWLEY : Well , you 're personalizing this like a political campaign . \nWhat we want free , fair , competitive and credible elections . \nNow there 's a process that needs to take place to get there . \nThe role that Mubarak or others within the government , that 's a decision to be made inside Egypt and not for us to dictate . \nBLITZER : You want stability leading up to the elections . \nAnd I guess the question is , will it be a more stable environment with President Mubarak as president or someone else ? \nCROWLEY : Well , the answer to that is in Tahrir Square . \nThe answer to that is not in Washington , D.C. . \nThe people will decide whether the process that goes forward is credible enough and delivers real change for them . \nBLITZER : If Mubarak were , tomorrow or next week or a month from now , to say , `` You know what ? \nI 'm going to go to Sharm El Sheikh . \nI 've got a summer home or a winter home over there in the southern tip of Sinai . '' \nOr `` I 'm going to go to Germany and get my annual medical examination there , '' do you want the vice president , Omar Suleiman , to be in charge ? \nCROWLEY : Again , those are Egyptian decisions not ours . \nWhat we want is a process , and whoever is participating in this process has to yield concrete results for the Egyptian people . \nBLITZER : So you 're not going to say about Omar Suleiman ? \nYou want it to be vague ? \nCROWLEY : This is not -- these are not our decisions . \nWe do n't have a favorite horse in this race . \nWe want to see a process ; we want to be inclusive . \nNow there are some people who have been invited into the dialogue that has already started . \nThose invitations need to broaden . \nThat participation needs to broaden . \nUltimately , what figures emerge from this process to both run the transition or lead up and run for the elections , not our decision . \nBLITZER : Is the U.S. government speaking to representatives as the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt ? \nCROWLEY : We have concerns about the Brotherhood , but we 're going to wait and see what -- what they do in this process . \nWe have questions about whether they are committed to a peaceful democratic process , but we 'll have the opportunity to see what they do . \nBLITZER : Because you regard Hamas and Hezbollah terrorist organizations , right ? \nCROWLEY : You 're talking about our contact ... BLITZER : The State Department . \nBut is it the same as far as the Muslim Brotherhood is concerned ? \nCROWLEY : Well , the Muslim Brotherhood is a fact of life in Egypt . \nThey have signed on to this process . \nWe 'll see what they do . \nBLITZER : Well , I guess the question is why not speak to them if they 're not considered a terrorist organization ? \nThey do -- they do have sizable support . \nCROWLEY : But , again , what 's important now is there is a dialogue between the Muslim Brotherhood and the government and other opposition figures . \nThat 's the conversation that does need to take place for Egypt going forward . \nBLITZER : If Egypt has fair elections , should the Muslim Brotherhood be allowed to run or should it be banned ? \nCROWLEY : Again , these are -- these are ... BLITZER : What does the U.S. think ? \nCROWLEY : These are decisions to be made inside Egypt . \nIt 's not for us to dictate who runs , who wins . \nThat 's not our role . \nWe will advise the Egyptians on how to move forward . \nWe 'll offer technical assistance on how to develop real political parties in the process at least for a competitive election . \nYou know , we want to see ... BLITZER : But just to be precise on the Muslim Brotherhood , Washington , the State Department has instructed U.S. diplomats in Cairo . \nYou can not speak to the Muslim Brotherhood ... CROWLEY : That is our standing position . \nWe have not changed our position . \nBLITZER : And it does n't look like it 's going to change any time soon ? \nCROWLEY : Well , that would be a mistake . \nWe think this has been a cornerstone of stability in the Middle East , and we think that the Egyptian government will recognize -- the future government will recognize this is important to Egypt ; it 's important to the region . \nIt 's fundamental to our relationship with Egypt . \nBLITZER : Would the U.S. sever military aid to Egypt ? \nCROWLEY : Again , you 're asking a hypothetical question . \nWe think at the end of the day that Egypt will recognize how important this is . \nBLITZER : You believe that they will maintain the peace treaty with Israel ? \nCROWLEY : We do . \nBLITZER : Right now , the U.S. gives Egypt , what , about a billion or a billion and a half dollars a year in military assistance ? \nBut you 've known , I 've read the State Department human rights reports for years , and every year it 's the same . \nViolations of basic human rights , arrests , torture . \nAll of that kind of stuff is documented , but it does n't seem to have ever had an impact in terms of reducing U.S. military aid to Egypt . \nCROWLEY : Well , again , we have assistance . \nWe have relationships that serve our interests . \nWe have ... BLITZER : And those trump the human rights interests ? \nCROWLEY : Well , but Wolf , you saw last week the constructive role that the military played in separating the pro-government and protesters in Tahrir Square . \nThis is a professional military . \nNow we do have concerns about certain activities in Egypt . \nWe 've never hesitated to raise those concerns . \nBut the aid , we believe , serves our national interest . \nAs we 've said , as things go forward , if we have concerns about how our assistance is being used , we wo n't hesitate to review that . \nBut right now there 's no reviewing . \nBLITZER : And one final question : was it a mistake to use Frank Wisner as the special envoy in delivering a message from the president to President Mubarak ? \nCROWLEY : We thought that Frank Wisner was uniquely qualified to deliver a very candid , very sharp message to President Mubarak and then make sure that message was ... BLITZER : And the suggestion that his business contacts as a senior executive or adviser of Patton Boggs -LRB- ph -RRB- , which has a lot of business relations in Egypt , is that a conflict as far as the State Department is concerned ? \nCROWLEY : We gave him a very specific mission . \nWe 're grateful that he did it . \nHe brought back his perspective on the current situation , and now he 's back to being a private citizen . \nBLITZER : No regrets using it ? \nBLITZER : Tough story . \nBut it 's mostly tough for the people of Egypt , as we all know right now . \nSarah Palin is criticizing the White House response to the unrest in Egypt . \nShe 's not alone . \nBLITZER : The former Alaska governor , possible presidential candidate Sarah Palin , is speaking out about Egypt right now . \nOur national political correspondent , Jessica Yellin , is here . \nShe 's working the story for us . \nWhat is she saying ? \nJESSICA YELLIN , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Well , she is very critical of the White House , Wolf . \nYou might not be surprised in their handling of Egypt . \nShe did n't weigh in until speaking to David Brody on his show , `` The Brody File , '' which airs on the Christian Broadcasting Network , and she rifted on the 3 a.m. phone call ad that we all remember from the 2008 campaign . \nSARAH PALIN , FORMER ALASKA GOVERNOR : This is the 3 a.m. White House phone call , and it seems for many of us trying to get that information from our leader in the White House , it seems that that call went right to the answering machine . \nAnd nobody yet has -- nobody yet has explained to the American public what they know -- and surely they know more than the rest of us know -- who it is who will be taking the place of Mubarak . \nAnd , no , not -- not real enthused about what it is that is being done on a national level from D.C. in regards to understanding all of the situation there in Egypt . \nYELLIN : Well , at the White House Robert Gibbs , the press secretary , was asked about Sarah Palin 's comments , and he said this . \nGIBBS : I 've got to tell you : I read that answer several times , and I -- I still do n't really know what -- I still do n't really know what she said . \nBLITZER : Some other potential Republican presidential candidates , what are they saying about the president 's strategy in Egypt ? \nYELLIN : A number of them have weighed in . \nFormer speaker Newt Gingrich was scathing in his criticism , saying that the president has n't prosecuted the war on terror enough . \nTim Pawlenty and Mitt Romney , they say the administration got off on the right foot to begin with , although Romney says the president did correct himself . \nMaybe the most interesting was from Mike Huckabee , who expressed some sympathy for Mubarak and then openly worried that the U.S. backing away from Mubarak could send other allies the message that the U.S. could back away from them . \nIn Huckabee 's words , quote , `` when it comes to difficulties and troubles a nation might face . '' \nSo plenty of criticism from the other side . \nBLITZER : Why should we not be surprised ? \nSenator Lindsey Graham , by the way , will be among the guests on `` JOHN KING USA '' later tonight . \nHe 'll weigh in on Sarah Palin 's comments . \n`` JOHN KING USA '' starts right at the top of the hour after THE SITUATION ROOM . \nEgypt certainly has taken the focus off another world hot spot . \nWe 're talking about North Korea . \nBut you 're about to get a firsthand glimpse at my recent journey there . \nBLITZER : In less than two hours , representatives from North and South Korea will meet for what 's being called working-level military talks , colonels from both sides starting the discussions . \nThese are the first talks since the showdown in December when I traveled to North Korea with Governor Bill Richardson . \nIt was a tense time , and many were calling the Korean Peninsula the most dangerous place on earth . \nI 've just completed a one-hour documentary on the trip . \nHere 's a little piece of it . \nBLITZER -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : We land in North Korea late in the afternoon on Thursday , December 16 . \nI have no idea this is going to be the strangest journey of my life . \nThe North Koreans take us into a room and confiscate our passports and cell phones . \nGOV. BILL RICHARDSON -LRB- D -RRB- , NEW MEXICO : It 's an eerie feeling . \nIt 's like you 're stepping into the '50s , into a city with old cars , very cold . \nIt 's like Dr. Strangelove . \nBLITZER : One of the first things you ca n't help but notice : the propaganda murals everywhere . \nHuge pictures of North Korea 's founder , Kim Il-Sung , and his son , the current leader , Kim Jong-Il , all over the place , almost at every corner . \nBut we do n't see any pictures of the new heir apparent , Kim Jong-Il 's youngest son , Kim Jong-Un . \nWe head to the foreign ministry . . \nRICHARDSON : This will be our first meeting where we try to ease tensions . \nBLITZER -LRB- on camera -RRB- : Ease tensions ? \nEasier said than done . \n-LRB- voice-over -RRB- That morning Richardson has his first meeting with North Korean officials . \nThis one would with Ri Yong Ho , the new vice minister who 's their expert on the United States . \nCNN is allowed in at the start of the meeting but then asked to leave . \n-LRB- on camera -RRB- Governor , how did it go ? \nRICHARDSON : Well , it was a decent start . \nBoth sides are feeling each other out . \nBLITZER -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : This journey is nothing if not surreal . \nIn the morning , meetings that could make the difference between war and peace . \nIn the afternoon , our North Korean handlers , all of whom are very polite and speak English well , take us sightseeing . \n-LRB- on camera -RRB- We 're on top of the world 's tallest stone tower here overlooking Pyongyang . \nIt really is majestic . \nYou see what 's going on . \nYou see the river and you see the bitter cold , the freezing snow . \n-LRB- voice-over -RRB- Our first full day in Pyongyang . \nBut the next day will be critical . \nRichardson will be meeting with North Korea 's chief nuclear negotiator , the man who invited him to visit this country , just as tensions on the Korean Peninsula are mounting . \n-LRB- on camera -RRB- The whole world is watching right now . \nOne miscalculation could cause a full-scale war . \nBLITZER : All this week we 're going to be showing you parts of this amazing journey . \nPlease be sure to tune in this Saturday , 6 p.m. Eastern , for my full one-hour documentary , `` Six Days in North Korea . '' \nI think you 're going to want to see it . \nJack Cafferty is coming up next . \nThen the star-spangled blunder seen and heard around the world . \nBLITZER : Let 's get right back to Jack for `` The Cafferty File '' -- Jack . \nJACK CAFFERTY , CNN ANCHOR : The question this hour is : `` Why is President Obama such a polarizing figure ? '' \nFrom the second year in office , the most polarizing president since Dwight Eisenhower . \nMichelle writes , `` I blame the right-wing media for throwing chaos into the mix by pumping the public with lies and manipulated information . \nI believe fear is their motive , fear of this new guy who threatens to work for the middle and lower classes , and best of all is the fear of the color of his skin . \nI really do n't know how these people sleep at night . '' \nPaula writes from Oregon , `` President Obama 's polarizing effects easily explained by the 80\\/20 rule . \nEighty percent of Republicans and right-wing media blowhards expected Obama to clean up Bush 's mess within 20 months . \nThe remainder , like Limbaugh and Beck , expected it in 20 minutes . '' \nSeth writes , `` Egocentric attitude on display . \nHis answer to Bill O'Reilly 's question yesterday , asking what was the worst thing about his job as president . \nInstead of the obvious : visiting wounded soldiers , meeting the parents of soldiers killed in action , et cetera , he said it was being in a bubble where he could n't do things like have a regular conversation because everything he says is analyzed , critiqued , reviewed , et cetera . \nSelf-absorption is a polarizing characteristic . '' \nPaul writes , `` I think the majority of Americans are center right . \nI believe most people do n't agree with President Obama 's policies . \nThe direction he would like to take the country is not in step with what most Americans think is the right direction . '' \nDavid in Phoenix , Arizona : `` I do n't think he is polarizing . \nI think FOX News makes him out to be . '' \nRichard in Kansas : `` Because he 's an intelligent black man who also represents the changing demographics and cultural identity of the country . \nAnd that scares he hell out of a lot of white people . '' \nAnd Marge in Vancouver writes , `` It 's not that President Obama 's polarizing . \nIt 's that the country is bipolar . \nRepublicans , Democrats , Christian right , everyone else . \nPeople who like Sarah Palin , people with brains , kids who are naughty , kids who are nice . \nIf Santa Claus was in the Oval Office , his poll numbers would be evenly split . '' \nBLITZER : Will do , Jack . \nSee you tomorrow Super Bowl viewers saw more than a fiercely fought game . \nThey saw companies spending millions of dollars on commercials . \nWe 'll have a sample of that coming up . \nBLITZER : Super Sunday not so super for some . \nHere 's CNN 's Jeanne Moos . \nJEANNE MOOS , CNN CORRESPONDENT -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : She cares more about her bowl than the Super Bowl , but the pug is a million-dollar winner . \nBiggest loser besides the Steelers was Christina Aguilera . \nHer national anthem bombed . \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : I was offended that she could n't get the words right . \nMOOS : The pug luckily had no speaking lines . \nDoritos invited folks to make their own commercials . \nMOOS : This one featured a guy teasing a pug through a glass door . \n-LRB- on camera -RRB- The budget for the pug commercial , $ 500 . \nThe prize , a million bucks . \n-LRB- voice-over -RRB- The pug ad tied with a Budweiser ad for the most popular Super Bowl commercial , according to the `` USA Today '' ad meter . \nThe creators just got engaged the other day , and the dog belongs to a friend . \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : Her name is Oko Nono . \nMOOS -LRB- on camera -RRB- : Oko Nono because she misbehaves and has to be told no , no so often that she thinks it 's her name . \n-LRB- voice-over -RRB- Now these two film-school grads have made their names . \nThey 'll use the million-dollar prize for their wedding and film projects . \nAnd for the pug . \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : Some bling . \nWe 've got to pimp out the pooch . \nMOO : But Christina Aguilera is the one in the doghouse for not singing the correct words , the ones on your screen . \nCHRISTINA AGUILERA , SINGER -LRB- singing -RRB- : What so proudly we watched at the twilight 's last gleaming . \nMOOS -LRB- on camera -RRB- : She may have forgotten the words this time , but she used to know them . \nAnd here 's the proof . \n-LRB- voice-over -RRB- Eleven-year-old Christina at a hockey game got through the line that all these years later tripped her up . \nBut hey , lots of folks get stuck on the ramparts . \nMichael Bolton got over a million views on YouTube after he resorted to notes on his hand to get through the very same line . \nMICHAEL BOLTON , SINGER -LRB- singing -RRB- : ... was so gallantly streaming . \nMOOS : This boy at a basketball game was another casualty of the ramparts . \nAt least Aguilera kept going and later apologized for getting caught up in the moment and losing her place . \nSome may criticize her ...

Special Tribunal on Lebanon that is investigating the assassination , describing it as a tool of Israel and the United States . \nSaad Hariri says his party wo n't join the new government without guarantees it will respect indictments handed down by the tribunal . \nPositions are hardening ahead of commemorations of the sixth anniversary of Rafik Hariri 's death on February 14 . \nThe daunting task of reconciliation has fallen to Najib Mikati -- a billionaire Sunni businessman involved in telecommunications , construction and other businesses . \nHe has said he wants to form a national unity government -- and is seeking to accommodate Sunnis , Shi'ites and Christians in government as he negotiates the bewildering alliances between Lebanon 's many parties . \nSome Lebanese politicians , notably the veteran Nabih Berri , a Shiite , are talking optimistically about a new government being formed within a week . \nOthers foresee a much longer period of wrangling just as Lebanon awaits the publication of the tribunal 's indictments , which for now are sealed . \nLebanon 's old divisions -- Christian against Sunni against Shiite -- are now more complex . \nSome Christian families , notably the Gemayels and their Kataeb party , are allied with the Sunni Hariri 's party and want to see Hezbollah 's wings clipped . \nBesides its political strength , Hezbollah 's militia numbers thousands of well-trained fighters and tens of thousands of rockets prepared for war with Israel . \nBut another prominent Christian , Michel Aoun , is allied with the Shiite Hezbollah . \nAnd Walid Jumblatt , the leader of the minority Druze community , has deserted Hariri for the pro-Syrian Hezbollah , even though Jumblat 's father was killed by the Syrians . \nAoun was brutally honest about his choice : `` We have the choice of stability at the price of justice by going with Hezbollah . '' \nIn other words , the publication of the indictments and any attempt to follow through with arrests would only destabilize Lebanon . \nMany view Lebanon as an emerging battleground between Iran and Syria on the one hand and pro-Western forces on the other . \n"}

'' \nThe Egyptian government did not allow outside monitors to observe the elections . \nThere were reports of rampant fraud and abuse . \nSome young people I had worked with sent me messages complaining that polling places had been closed early . \nSome were not even let in to vote . \nMany female candidates were not given party support or funding . \nIt was a devastating blow to those young Egyptians who had worked so hard to try to initiate change . \nIt was hard to be encouraging . \nThat is , until we saw what happened in Tunisia . \nI got a message the night before the protests from a young woman I had trained in Cairo . \nShe wanted me to know that thousands of youth were going to demonstrate to fight corruption . \nShe warned that police violence was expected and wanted me to spread the news to support her in her fight for freedom . \nThe news spread like wildfire over the huge social networks those groups had built over the years . \nBut their only plan was to unseat President Hosni Mubarak . \nIt did n't take long for other voices to co-opt their message . \nMubarak took his time responding , letting protest fatigue set in . \nLines of communication were shut down . \nMubarak did not step down . \nMy heart broke when I saw the violence erupt in the streets . \nThe young people who are in touch with me say many of those `` pro-Mubarak '' supporters were paid thugs , some flashing department of the interior badges . \nOthers report that Egyptian state television is broadcasting that Israeli agents and the media are behind the demonstrations in Tahrir Square . \nJournalists were hunted as they continued to shine a light on what is going on there . \nIt is not an exaggeration to suggest that the future of a whole generation is riding on the outcome of this showdown . \nStunned by the news out of Egypt ? \nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kelli Arena . \n"}

{"id": "39", "time": "2011-02-07", "text": "February 07 , 2011 | By Bruce Rutherford , Special to CNN The demonstrations that erupted on January 25 were driven by Egyptians ' aspirations for greater dignity in their lives . \nMost Egyptians have seen their standard of living deteriorate over the past decade because of rising unemployment , persistent inflation and stagnant wages . \nThey have also suffered from a corrupt and brutal police force that subjected the population to arbitrary arrest , torture and myriad indignities large and small . \nThese sources of anger have been simmering for some time . \nThe events that caused them to boil over were the demonstrations in Tunisia that led to the overthrow of that country 's long-serving dictator , Zine El Abidine Ben Ali , a few weeks ago . \nThese events fundamentally altered the way many Egyptians viewed demonstrations . \nBefore Ben Ali 's departure , many Egyptians saw little point in going to the streets to express their anger . \nThere was little chance things would change , and they would probably be beaten by the security police . \nAfter Ben Ali 's departure , many thousands of Egyptians decided that demonstrations could actually bring about meaningful change and were worth the risk , so they turned out in droves . \nThe situation remains very fluid , and the result is still uncertain . \nAs this process of change unfolds , there are three actors who will play particularly important roles : Can they form a leadership that articulates clear demands beyond the removal of Mubarak and that can negotiate with the regime ? \nSo far the protesters -- who have been savvy in so many ways , from utilizing social media to creating a minicity in Tahrir Square -- have been remarkably unsavvy about the substance of politics . \nMaybe it 's a reflection of the internet generation 's resentment of hierarchy . \nThey had better get over this hesitation quickly and appoint credible and effective leaders or their sacrifices may be for naught . \nAlso , will large numbers of demonstrators continue to turn out ? \nIt looks like President Hosni Mubarak is determined to hold on for another seven months . \nThe only way this will change is if demonstrators continue to come to Tahrir Square en masse , even as life otherwise returns to normal . \nThe most likely way for this to unfold is for the Friday of each week to become the `` day of demonstration '' in which average people , who work during the week , come down to Tahrir for a day of protest in ever-larger numbers . \nIf these Friday demonstrations steadily grow in size , Mubarak may eventually take the hint and accept an early exit . \n"}

Zelizer , Special to CNN An anti-government protester chants and gestures in front of soldiers guarding the Egyptian Museum in Tahrir Square . \nAmericans have long debated whether to try to achieve democratic ideals overseas Julian Zelizer says `` realists '' argued U.S. should not seek democracy in Mideast He says `` idealists '' say U.S. should promote democracy , human rights overseas Outcome of Egypt revolt likely to shape foreign policy for years , he says Editor 's note : Julian E. Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University . \nHe is the author of `` Jimmy Carter , '' published by Times Books , and editor of a book assessing former President George W. Bush 's administration , published by Princeton University Press . \nPrinceton , New Jersey -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- When the Egyptian people took to the streets of Cairo to protest the oppressive government of President Hosni Mubarak , they instantly challenged one of the most powerful strains of U.S. foreign policy thinking . \nIn American diplomatic circles , the `` realists '' have long argued that the U.S. must be primarily focused on national self-interest , rather than concentrating on trying to promote democracy and human rights in other countries . \nThey object to the style of idealism promoted by President Woodrow Wilson , who envisioned that war and diplomacy could transform international relations by institutionalizing cooperation among nations , allowing for the self-determination of people and ending war for all time . \nIn The New York Times , former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger -- one of the most famous proponents of realism -- wrote that his approach to foreign policy respected the importance of values but insisted `` on a careful , even unsentimental , weighing of the balance of material forces . '' \nBy contrast , he wrote , trying to promote idealism in foreign policy `` translates it into a call for crusades on behalf of regime change . '' \nOne of the classic formulations of these ideas was penned by Georgetown professor -- and future Reagan adviser and U.N. ambassador -- Jeane Kirkpatrick in 1979 . \nIn her article , `` Dictatorships and Double Standards , '' Kirkpatrick argued that often the U.S. could not be on the side of democracy if it meant supporting governments that would be hostile to U.S. interests . \nShe criticized President Jimmy Carter for being hostile to autocratic governments that were willing to work with the U.S. against communism . \nKirkpatrick rejected the idea that it was possible to democratize countries in all circumstances . \nNowhere has the power of realism been stronger than in U.S. Middle East policy . \nFor many decades the U.S. has supported Arab governments whose behavior fundamentally contradicts democratic ideals . \nU.S. policymakers concluded that there were no other options . \nElBaradei - Egyptian opposition demands It is impossible , they said , for democracy to take root in the Middle East given the history of the region . \nTo protect strategic interests such as access to oil , they felt it essential to make peace with bad rulers . \nRealism has been challenged on the left and the right . \nDuring the 1970s , the human rights movement pushed the U.S. to embrace the political and civil rights of others as a legitimate claim in U.S. foreign policy . \nSome neoconservatives , such as Washington Sen. Henry `` Scoop '' Jackson , claimed that the U.S. needed to insist the Soviet Union provide basic human rights , such as allowing Soviet Jews to leave the country . \nCarter institutionalized these concerns with new policies in the State Department , and Ronald Reagan rejected the realism of Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford . \nHe argued that there could be no accommodation with the Soviet Union and believed that ultimately communism would fall . \nAlthough Reagan ended up pursuing his goal through arms negotiation -- which went against many of his arguments -- the collapse of the Soviet Union that began during his presidency and culminated in 1991 seemed to give legitimacy to the arguments that promoting democracy is a valid goal for the U.S. . \nThe loudest push for idealism was heard from President George W. Bush 's administration . \nThe Bush Doctrine , announced in 2002 , included a commitment to promote `` freedom '' and the `` development of democratic institutions . '' \nBush argued that the removal of Saddam Hussein in Iraq offered the opportunity to create a bastion of democracy in the Middle East that would spread the ideal to other countries . \nLast week , the neoconservative Elliot Abrams argued in The Washington Post that events in Egypt showed that Bush was correct . \n`` Arab nations too , '' Abrams wrote , `` yearn to throw off the secret police , to read the newspaper that the Ministry of Information has not censored and to vote in free elections . '' \nBut Bush 's legacy created as many problems for idealists as it did sources of support . \nAfter all , Iraq remains unstable , and the future of civil society there is unclear . \nBush tried to impose democracy from above and did not invest sufficient resources to remake the country . \nMany conservatives claimed that Bush had gone too far . \nPresident Obama , who had been idealistic in many ways on foreign policy , drew back from Bush 's rhetoric about democracy and fell more in line with the realists . \nThe administration cut the funding for several programs aimed at promoting democracy and civil society in Egypt . \nThe realists have been highly skeptical about Egypt . \nThey warn that revolution in Egypt could open the door to Islamic fundamentalism , as in Iran in 1979 , and cost the U.S. and Israel one of their most loyal allies . \nShould the Egyptians be able to withstand the response of the Mubarak government and be able to establish a truly democratic and secular government , the results would be dramatic . \nThese turbulent weeks could be remembered in the same way the nation remembers the late 1980s and early 1990s , when conditions that seemed inevitable in the Soviet empire suddenly were not . \nHowever , if Mubarak stifles the revolution , or fundamentalism takes hold , realists will , for a long time , point to Egypt as the prime example of why we can not hope for much better than the status quo when it comes to the Middle East . \nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian E. Zelizer . \n"}

{"id": "27", "time": "2011-01-27", "text": "January 27 , 2011 | By Tarek Osman , Special to CNN This week tens of thousands swamped the heart of Cairo , Alexandria , and other major Egyptian cities , facing down anti-riot police , to demand cheaper food , better services , and substantial changes to the regime 's modus operandi . \nWith five dead , more than 100 injured , and the police resorting to tear gas to disperse the demonstrators , most observers are examining whether the Egyptian regime will be able to contain the situation and suppress the protests without even more significant bloodshed . \nTwo factors suggest continued tension and further challenges to the regime . \nFirst , the Egyptian state 's institutional framework is at its weakest point since the coup\\/revolution of 1952 that created the Egyptian republic . \nThe delicate balance that the regime has nurtured , between the rise of the liberal capitalists within the ruling National Democratic Party -LRB- NDP -RRB- and the traditional power and influence of the military and security establishment , seems to be under strain . \nThe center of gravity and decision-making has shifted from the long-established anchors of stability toward inexperienced new economic and financial players . \nThe ascent of the new capitalists gave rise to the second factor : an unexpected solidarity between the politically active -- who see the influence of the new capitalists as a blurring of the lines between power and wealth -- and the disenfranchised poor , who as a result of successive financial reform measures , face severe economic pains . \nThe situation is made more acute by a youth unemployment rate of more than 15 % -LRB- in an 80 million population , 40 % of whom are under 30 years old -RRB- . \nThe politically active and the millions of poor Egyptians blame the Hosni Mubarak regime , which has been in power for three decades . \nThis is a tenuous political environment , where anguish and anxiety can quickly turn into anger , and with any catalyst , into action . \nBut , so far , the situation in Egypt is not combustible . \nDespite the regime 's overall poor record , its major upgrading of the country 's infrastructure , relative success in installing economic liberalization , and cautious foreign policy have fostered an environment in which a few million middle class families managed to secure economic gains . \nThe past decade also witnessed a notable rise in entrepreneurialism with hundreds of thousands of Egyptians able to build small enterprises leveraging the growth in economic sectors ranging from food and beverages , to tourism , to information technology , to entertainment . \n"}

'' \nHer glasses were broken and police confiscated two cell phones , the journalists group said in a Wednesday statement . \nThe Committee to Protect Journalists also said Wednesday that Egyptian authorities have shut down the websites of two popular independent newspapers , Al-Dustour and El-Badil . \nThe clampdown comes after thousands of protesters spilled into the streets of Egypt on Tuesday in an unprecedented display of anti-government rage inspired in part by the tumult in another North African nation , Tunisia . \nAt least four people died in the Tuesday clashes , the Interior Ministry reported -- three protesters in Suez and one police officer in Cairo . \nIt also said at least 102 security personnel were injured . \nThe Interior Ministry put the size of the Tuesday demonstration in Cairo 's Tahrir Square at 10,000 at its peak , falling to 5,000 . \nCNN estimated that demonstration peaked at 15,000 to 20,000 . \nBut Wednesday is a work day in Egypt , so the numbers on the streets of Cairo were lower than they were on Tuesday , a holiday known as Police Day . \nProtesters had been expressing their anger over the rising cost of living , failed economic policies and corruption , but all those concerns were distilled into one overriding demand -- the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak , a reliable American ally who has been in power for three decades . \nEgyptian authorities have been aware of complaints , but protesters widely believe the government has simply paid lip service to their grievances . \nThere is talk among protesters about staging a big demonstration on Friday , after Muslim prayers . \nTwitter said it was blocked for the second day on Wednesday but added that `` some users are using apps\\/proxies to successfully tweet . '' \nMagdi Radi , spokesman for Egypt 's prime minister , told CNN that the government `` did n't block Facebook , Twitter or any other website . \nHe said that `` the websites may have been slow because of the heavy usage . '' \nThe Arabic Network for Human Rights Information , a human rights group , on Wednesday underscored a `` national demand '' -- the dismissal of Interior Minister Habib Al-Adli . \n`` Yesterday , disengagement of peaceful gatherings by using excessive force was added to his crimes as well as arbitrary arrests of hundreds of citizens and detaining them in illegal locations , such as security camps of Darrasa in Cairo and Madinet el Salam at the outskirts of Cairo , two locations completely controlled by the Interior Ministry . '' \nThe group said police `` turned into monsters attacking demonstrators , especially small clusters in side streets , without distinction between an elderly man or a woman or youth . '' \nOrganizers said they hope to capture the regional momentum for political change set by Tunisians , who forced the collapse of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali 's 23-year rule . \nBut Mubarak , unlike Ben Ali , remains in his country . \nStories that Mubarak or any other member of his family left Egypt are `` categorically false , '' said Karim Haggag , Egyptian Embassy spokesman in Washington . \nCalling its relationship with Egypt `` strong and friendly , '' the U.S. State Department regards Mubarak 's help in maintaining security in the Mideast as critical . \nThe government , which has diplomatic relations with Israel , has helped forge peace between Israel and the Palestinians and has helped in efforts to stabilize Iraq , the State Department said . \nIt contributes to U.N. peacekeeping missions , `` played a key role during the 1990-1991 Gulf crisis , '' and is a `` key supporter of U.S. efforts against terrorists and terrorist organizations such as Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda , the department said in a background note about Egypt . \nU.S. military aid to Egypt totals over $ 1.3 billion annually , and the U.S. Agency for International Development has passed along more than $ 28 billion in economic and development assistance to the country since 1975 . \nWhite House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Wednesday that the Obama administration continues to monitor the situation . \nHe called on all parties to refrain from violence and said authorities should lift bans on protests . \nAsked at Wednesday 's briefing whether the U.S. continues to back Mubarak , Gibbs said that `` Egypt is a strong ally . '' \nOn Wednesday , U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Jordanian Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh spoke to reporters about the ferment in the Arab world . \nClinton urged freedom for people and called on Egyptian authorities not to block social media . \nShe urged the countries in the region to enact reforms and expressed optimism that the leaders there can do so . \n`` It is something that everyone knows must be on the agenda of the government as they -- not just respond to the protests -- but as they look beyond to what needs to be done economically , socially , politically . \nAnd there are a lot of very well-informed , active , civil society leaders in Egypt who have put forward specific ideas for reform and we are encouraging and urging the Egyptian government to be responsive to that . '' \nJordan has experienced demonstrations over economic issues , and the foreign minister was asked whether the protests that raged in Tunisia and Egypt will spread . \nJudeh said Jordan does n't exist in an economic bubble and faces hardships that other lands endure . \nBut he said the country is tackling a political and economic reform agenda and its system promotes freedom of expression . \nCNN 's Ben Wedeman , Amir Ahmed and Salma Abdelaziz contributed to this report \n"}

modern humans , who looked and perhaps behaved much like us , must have lived in eastern Arabia about 100,000 to 125,000 years ago . \nThe collection of small hand axes , scrapers and other tools was found in Jebel Faya , United Arab Emirates . \nA report about the discovery appears in the journal Science . \nThe people who made these tools `` are our ancestors , I have no doubt about that , '' said Hans-Peter Uerpmann , of the University of Tubingen in Germany , who collaborated on the project , at a press teleconference Wednesday . \nBut the findings still do not prove definitively that modern humans made these tools , as the researchers did not find human remains near them , said Ted Goebel , anthropologist at Texas A&M University , who was not involved in the study . \nThey potentially could have been made by Neanderthals or Neanderthal-like hominids , who were already in Eurasia at that time , Goebel said . \nAlmost 300 protesters arrived at Athens University this week

the appeals court announced an inquiry into whether the university failed to take action to prevent the immigrants from occupying the building . \nThe Athens News Agency explained that under Greek law , university campuses are off-limits to police unless they have been invited or a serious crime has been committed . \nGreece s majority party says leftists have abused the law and are using the

{"id": "258", "time": "2011-01-27", "text": "January 27 , 2011 | By Tim Lister and Emily Smith , CNN Protesters have used social media sites -- when not blocked -- to organize and spread pictures of demonstrations in Egypt . \nAs in Tunisia , the protest movement in Egypt is taking advantage of social media to communicate , inform and organize . \nDespite attempts to block Twitter , Facebook and other sites -LRB- the government denies it was responsible -RRB- , a Facebook page devoted to Friday 's planned protests had more than 80,000 followers as of 2 p.m. ET Thursday , compared with some 20,000 the previous day . \nFollowing Twitter comments with hashtags such as #Cairo , #jan 25 and #Suez generates a huge flood of tweets . \nThere is a breathless excitement about many entries , which are mainly in Arabic , English and French , but there are also scores of rumors , much invention and plenty of hyperbole . \nSifting the wheat from the chaff , given the extraordinary volume of traffic , is a full-time job . \nOne typically overstated entry on a Facebook page Thursday read : `` Live ammunition is being fired at protesters . \n... Innocent protesters who want their basic rights are being massacred . '' \nThere is as much misinformation as information . \nBut social media can help tip off journalists about developments in places they ca n't get to . \nFor example , it 's been difficult -LRB- and risky -RRB- for foreign journalists to report from the city of Suez , which appears to have seen some of the worst violence of the past few days . \nBut a steady stream of tweets and blog entries , as well as photos and cell-phone video , has provided at least some guidance on the rapidly evolving situation there . \nIn a country the size of Egypt , even large media organizations ca n't be everywhere , especially when the security forces are throwing up roadblocks . \nAs the protests have had -LRB- so far -RRB- little formal organization , social media have become a critical tool for arranging rendezvous . \nOne Twitter entry , for example , called for a march at 3 p.m. Thursday in Giza , a suburb of Cairo . \nAnother on Wednesday called people to Tahrir Square in central Cairo . \nOf course , there is a weakness in such methods -- because the authorities can also read them , and a plethora of such rallying calls can lead to confusion . \nIn any case , social media may be overtaken as an organizing tool on Friday -- by Egypt 's mosques . \nThe Muslim Brotherhood , which is influential in thousands of mosques throughout the country , has called for protests after Friday prayers . \nBut the Brotherhood is playing catch-up with a movement it has done little to influence so far . \n"}

{"id": "58", "time": "2011-01-27", "text": "From Ben Wedeman , CNN Senior International Correspondent ElBaradei : Egypt is not stable Egypt is a much more dominant influence on the Arab world than Tunisia Protester in Egypt have been able to make much more effective use of the internet Egypt has seen lower rates of unemployment in recent years Middle classes have played a major role in protests in Egypt and Tunisia Cairo , Egypt -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Egypt has been rocked by protests in recent days , only weeks after similar disturbances sparked revolution in Tunisia and forced then-president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali to flee the country . \nWhat similarities are there between the situation in Egypt and that in Tunisia ? \nBoth nations have seen dramatic rises in the cost of living in recent years as well as accusations of corruption among the ruling elite . \nEgyptian President Hosni Mubarak has now been in power since 1981 -- six years before ex-Tunisian ruler Zine El Abidine Ben Ali , who was forced from office earlier this month , assumed the presidency of his country . \nThe protest movements in both nations have also been characterized by strong middle class elements . \nNo surprise then that the dissent in Tunisia has inspired some demonstrators in Egypt . \nBut below the surface there are differences between these two North African nations . \nTunisia , until the fall of Ben Ali , had a strictly controlled media , with severe restrictions on what could be reported . \nEgyptian protests got ` so big so fast ' The press in Egypt , in contrast is lively and often highly critical of the president and his government . \nCertainly the media is afforded much more freedom than its counterparts in Syria , Iraq under Saddam Hussein and Tunisia . \nAnti-government rallies are not uncommon in Egypt -- but usually protesters are heavily outnumbered by the security forces . \nThis week 's protests have been unusual because demonstrators on the streets of Cairo have outnumbered police . \nIs there as much freedom on the internet in Egypt ? \nEgypt has a less restrictive approach to social media : Facebook is freely available and often used as a means to organize protests . \nTwitter has also been used as an organizing tool . \nBy contrast the previous Tunisian government took a more hardline attitude toward the web , closing down sites and forcing protesters to rely more heavily on cellphone SMS and word-of-mouth . \nSo have the protesters in Egypt made use of the internet ? \nDefinitely , driving protests more so than in Tunisia . \nTwo groups stand out . \nThe first is the Facebook group `` We are All Khaled Said , '' its name taken from an Alexandria activist who was allegedly beaten to death by police last year . \nIt wants limits on the presidential term -- Egypt faces an election later this year -- and a raise in the minimum wage among other demands . \nBy early Tuesday it had 90,000-plus users signed up . \nThe April 6 Movement , started in 2008 on Facebook to support striking workers , shares many of the same concerns and is similarly characterized by a strong following among the young of Egypt . \nOne political group that has been largely , though not totally , absent from the protests is the banned Muslim Brotherhood , the biggest organized opposition to the government . \nIt draws its support from the poorer members of society , especially in the slums of Cairo and also Upper Egypt , but also among professionals , such as lawyers and doctors . \nThe Egyptian government frequently characterizes the Brotherhood as an extremist group and uses this -- and the terror threat -- as a reason for clampdowns on opposition . \nEarlier in the week the Brotherhood said it would not be officially participating in protests but added it would not prevent its members from taking part . \nOn Thursday the Brotherhood called for its followers to demonstrate after Friday 's weekly prayers -- the first time in the current round of unrest that the largest opposition bloc has told supporters to take to the streets . \nThe economy is clearly a factor in the unrest across North Africa . \nHow do Egypt and Tunisia compare ? \nEgyptian government being too harsh ? \nCould Cairo be the next Tunis ? \nJournalist ` trapped and beaten ' in Egypt The Egyptian economy has been in better shape in recent years than its Tunisian counterpart and has key exports such as oil on which it can rely . \nIt also depends heavily on tourism , and revenues from the Suez Canal . \nTunisia 's GDP grew by 3.4 % in 2010 and 3 % in 2009 , compared to 5.3 % and 4.6 % during the same periods in Egypt , according to the CIA Factbook . \nMeanwhile the unemployment rate in Egypt stood at 9.7 % last year , compared to 14 % in Tunisia for the same period . \nIn both cases analysts believe the true unemployment rate is substantially higher . \nOne of the complaints from many protesters in Egypt is that they have not been able to enjoy the fruits of this economic success . \nThere has also been unease that the Egyptian government , which used to involve itself in crackdowns on black market activity and speculation , has played a less active role in recent years . \nHistorically Egypt has a larger percentage of its population living below the poverty line than Tunisia -- 20 % , according to a 2005 estimate , compared to 3.8 % . \nBut many of those poor have not been involved in this week 's protests , their places taken by students , businessmen and even middle-aged couples . \nPoor Egyptians can not take time off work to protest . \nThere have been clashes between security forces and protesters in Egypt . \nIs the army going to get involved ? \nThe army in Tunisia played a crucial role : despite clashes between security forces and protesters , the military never gave its backing to the then-president . \nIn Egypt , the military has likewise rarely become involved in protests -- the last major incidents were bread riots in 1977 and a police strike in 1985 . \nEven the assassination of Hosni Mubarak 's predecessor Anwar El Sadat in 1981 involved only a small hardcore group of officers motivated by extremism . \nThis apolitical approach means that the army is held in high regard by many ordinary Egyptians . \nFurther afield , how is Egypt regarded by the United States ? \nThe United States closely monitors all developments in North Africa due to the war on terror and the threat of extremism . \nHowever , among Arab nations Egypt enjoys a near-unparalleled relationship with Washington . \nOn Tuesday Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that while the United States backed the `` the fundamental right of expression and assembly for all people '' it believed that the `` the Egyptian government is stable and is looking for ways to respond to the legitimate needs and interests of the Egyptian people . '' \nBut on Wednesday Clinton said , `` We believe strongly that the Egyptian government has an important opportunity at this moment in time to implement political , economic and social reforms to respond to the legitimate needs and interests of the Egyptian people . '' \nShe also urged the government not to prevent peaceful protests or block social networking sites . \nAlso Wednesday White House press secretary Robert Gibbs was asked if the administration supports Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak . \nHe replied : `` Egypt is a strong ally . '' \nEgypt has been a major player in the Middle East peace process over the decades -- most famously the Camp David Accords signed by Sadat , Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and U.S. President Jimmy Carter in 1978 . \nAfter Israel , Egypt is now the second biggest recipient of U.S. aid . \nWashington also regards Egypt as a key ally in the war on terror . \nIt has also been alleged that Egypt has sometimes been used by the U.S. for rendition . \nItalian prosecutors claimed in 2005 that suspected CIA agents kidnapped Osama Nasr Mostafa Hassan in Milan and that he was taken to Egypt for interrogation and torture . \nThe U.S. maintains it does not send suspects to countries that condone torture . \nEgypt has also played a key role in issues including the containment of Iran and relations between Lebanon and Syria . \nIn comparison Tunisia has its importance -- it was hit by extremist attacks in the early to mid-1980s -- but does not compare strategically . \nAnd what about the rest of the Arab world ? \nAgain , Egypt carries far more clout than its North African neighbor . \nAside from its economic and strategic weight , it has a population of more than 80 million -- nearly eight times that of Tunisia . \nThe rest of the Arab world is heavily influenced by Egyptian culture including literature , movies and TV . \nPut simply , it 's at the heart of the region in a way that Tunisia is not . \nNick Hunt and the CNN Wire contributed to this report \n"}

'' \nIn an exclusive interview with CNN , Ghonim , who was freed by Egyptian authorities on Monday after 10 days , said it is `` no longer the time to negotiate '' with the regime of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak . \n`` There 's a lot of blood now '' that has been spilled , he said . \nIt 's time for people at the highest levels of the government `` to apologize to the families '' of those killed , he said . \nHuman Rights Watch said Tuesday the number of people killed in the Egyptian protests has reached 302 - 232 in Cairo , 52 in Alexandria and 18 in Suez . \nGhonim played a key role in organizing the protests that have convulsed Egypt for more than two weeks . \nHe was the administrator of a Facebook page that is widely credited with calling the first protest January 25 . \nA Google executive who lives in Dubai with his wife and two children , he had returned to Egypt for the protests . \nHis disappearance January 28 quickly captured international attention . \nAll youth in Egypt like Wael Ghonim , From my point of view he is the most appropriate person to be the leader of the protesters and to talk to the vice president to convince him with the deterioration in Egypt 's economic if president Mubarak stay in his position . \nWe see every day labors strikes in Egypt , this will increasing and will not stop until Mubarak steps down . \nFebruary 10 , 2011 at 7:36 am | Any attempt at seeing both sides of this conflict , went out the window for me the day he unleashed his modern day version of the `` Brown Shirts '' upon the crowd of peaceful protestors . \nI watched in disbelief as those goons spent the better part of 24 hours trying to physically smash the movement . \nI went to bed that evening believing they had succeeded in crushing the revolt . \nThen I woke up , turned on the news , and found that the protestors had beaten back the Goons , and pushed them out of the square . \nBut there is the rub . \nThis story has now become a `` standoff '' . \nMubarek can hang on , his state run TV can spew their lies , and they can wait for the fire to leave the heart of this movement . \nThose people in the square dare not leave , the waters are very dangerous beyond the confines they have fought for . \nIn effect , they have done what they can do with just a powerful thought , but no one thought that guns may be needed . \nForce may be needed . \nHosni Mubarek obviously thought about that ... so the standoff continues . \nI guess the best we can hope for is the world 's media continues to shine the light on this story , and the Egyptians figure out how to get Mubarek to leave , without much more bloodshed . \nIf the media moves on eventually ... that die hard group in Tahrir Square will be in very serious trouble . \nThey want the man out ... but what is their plan for governence ? \nFebruary 10 , 2011 at 1:49 am | Wanted to again state you are not alone Wael , sweetheart ! \nMore of the American public than you know are looking for ways to support your future way of life . \nWhat is happening is not just an uprising to be squelished by the smaller minded , big dollar men of the world but an introduction into the new world of open thinkers , tolerance and peace seekers ! \nWe and all I know salute you ! \nLet me know what I can do to help in any way !!!!!!

'' \nHuman Rights Watch said the Palestinian Authority , which controls the West Bank , `` used violence against peaceful demonstrators '' during a rally last week in which people were supporting the Egyptian protesters . \n`` Witnesses told Human Rights Watch that regular police and ` special forces , ' identifiable by their uniforms , punched , kicked , and detained participants , as well as at least two journalists and a Human Rights Watch research assistant , '' the report said . \nThe report added that on January 30 , the Palestinian Authority shut down a solidarity demonstration . \nHamas , which controls Gaza , `` quashed a solidarity demonstration on January 31 , '' Human Rights Watch said . \n`` The police arbitrarily arrested six women and threatened to arrest another 20 people , who had responded to a call on Facebook for a demonstration , as soon as they arrived at the Park of the Unknown Soldier in Gaza City . '' \nCNN reported on the January 31 demonstration , in which Hamas security broke up the event and detained some female protesters . \nCNN has also reported on the Palestinian Authority breaking up two attempts to stage small rallies . \nThe Palestinian Authority said participants did not have government permission for the rallies . \nWitnesses said participants were pushed and shoved , and some were detained . \nLater , both the Palestinian Authority and Hamas allowed some events supporting solidarity with Egypt to take place . \nOn Saturday , Palestinians demonstrating in support of Egyptian anti-government protesters , at an approved event in Ramallah , were forcibly dispersed when a few dozen men in civilian clothes disrupted the protest . \n"}

' '' \nHis words prompted the protesters to begin chanting `` Egypt above all else . '' \nFreed Prisoners Tell Their Stories Getting to the truth in Egypt Journalists in Egypt reveal plight `` I apologize to you , I am so tired , '' Ghonim said . \n`` Today we are emphasizing our voice . '' \nAs he walked off the stage , Ghonim told a reporter in English , `` We do n't care . \nWe are going to do what we 've got to do . '' \nGhonim , a Dubai-based marketing executive , is the administrator of a Facebook page called `` We are all Khaled Said , '' named after an Alexandria activist who was allegedly beaten to death by police . \nThe page is widely credited with calling the first protest January 25 . \nAnother Facebook page created to authorize Ghonim to speak on behalf of the protesters has 150,000 fans . \n`` I came today for the first time -LRB- Tuesday -RRB- , '' said Dalia , a protester in Tahrir Square . \nShe did not give her last name . \n`` Nothing will make this regime go unless we keep on coming and keep on coming . '' \nEarlier , Vice President Omar Suleiman announced on state television that a committee has been authorized to amend Egypt 's constitution to allow for free , fair and competitive elections . \nThe amendments , Suleiman said , would be drafted by an independent judicial commission . \nHe said he had discussed a number of reforms in recent talks with opposition representatives . \nAmong them were greater freedom for the media , the release of detainees and the lifting of the continuous state of emergency . \nHe also assured Egyptians that they should not fear arrest for speaking their minds . \nBut with the credibility of the regime in serious question , the statements from President Hosni Mubarak 's deputy fell short . \nReal change , say Mubarak 's foes , can only come with Mubarak 's immediate departure and an overhaul of the constitution , not amendments here and there . \n`` That 's not good enough , '' said Mohammed Habib , a leader of the Muslim Brotherhood , a key opposition party in Egypt that is outlawed by the constitution on grounds that it is based on religion . \n`` The first thing that the regime should do is for the president to leave , '' he said . \n`` The government is dividing the opposition through these announcements . '' \nAsem Abedine , head of the pan-Arab Nassiri party , said Mubarak is merely angling for time . \n`` The government is only making these announcements to avoid making real changes demanded by the people , '' he said . \n`` The emergency laws should be lifted . '' \nMubarak has ruled Egypt with an iron hand since 1981 , aided by an emergency decree that gave him sweeping powers . \nHow wealthy is Egypt 's Mubarak ? \nSince the protests began January 25 , he has appointed a vice president for the first time , reshuffled his Cabinet and announced that he wo n't seek a new term in September . \nHowever , the constitution remains , reshaped in 2005 and again in 2007 to help retain power for the ruling National Democratic Party . \nIt has been at the heart of the dialogue between the government and some opposition representatives , who want several articles amended to make way for greater political participation . \nThe demonstrations , powered by the stamina of those who have put everything at risk for change , got an extra shot of energy Tuesday from Ghonim 's emotional interview on Egypt 's Dream TV . \nHe said four people surrounded him at 1 a.m. on January 28 . \n`` I yelled , ` Help me , ' but of course I knew these were security forces . \n`` The thing that tortured me the most when I was in detention was that people would find out that I was the admin -LRB- of the Facebook page -RRB- , '' he said . \n`` Because I am not the hero -- I was writing with the keyboard on the internet and my life was not exposed to any danger . '' \nHe walked out of the Dream TV interview in tears after being shown photos of those killed in the uprising . \n`` I want to say to every mother and every father that lost his child , I am sorry , but this is not our fault , '' he said before leaving . \n`` I swear to God this is not our fault . \nIt is the fault of everyone who was holding onto power greedily and would not let it go . '' \nBut while the crowds remained large and boisterous , opposition voices have started to splinter . \nSome , including members of the self-declared Council of the Wise , have said they do n't agree that Mubarak 's immediate departure would be the best thing for Egypt . \nArab League Secretary-General Amre Moussa , who was among protesters last week , told CNN that Mubarak should be allowed a `` dignified exit '' in September . \n`` I believe that the president should stay until the end of his mandate . \nThe consensus is growing on this point because of certain constitutional considerations , '' Moussa said . \nState television in Egypt is suggesting that the United States is helping fund the protests , which -- it says -- have been infiltrated by Hamas , Hezbollah , Iran and others . \nThe divisions within the opposition raised fears that they could work to the regime 's advantage . \n`` The danger at the moment is that this opposition , which a few days ago seemed to unite , is now being divided , '' said Cairo-based analyst Issandr El Amrani . \n`` The regime is using its tried and true tactic of divide and conquer . '' \nCNN 's Ben Wedeman , Salma Abdelaziz , Amir Ahmed , Frederik Pleitgen , Saad Abedine , Caroline Faraj and Jill Dougherty contributed to this report . \n"}

{"id": "189", "time": "2011-01-29", "text": "DON LEMON , CNN ANCHOR : Hello , everyone . \nDon Lemon here at the CNN world headquarters in Atlanta . \nThank you so much for joining us . \nA popular uprising in Egypt that threatens to bring down the presidency of Hosni Mubarak now in its fifth day . \nLEMON : Dozens of people have died in violent clashes with riot police over the past week . \nMany others have been injured . \nHere you see the body of one victim carried today through the streets of Cairo . \nIt is impossible to know how many people were out protesting today . \nBut tens of thousands , it 's safe to say is an estimate . \nOne major change is the disappearance of riot police . \nNow , military troops and vehicles fill parts of Cairo . \nAnd for the most part , the military and civilians have avoided clashing with each other . \nBut what we are now seeing is how protests have spread to cities around the world . \nLEMON : Impassioned Egyptian-Americans gathered in Washington today , calling for the removal of Egypt 's president . \nThey rallied first at the Egyptian embassy and then marched to the White House . \nInside the White House , President Obama huddled with his national security team to discuss the crisis . \nThere 's a lot at stake because Egypt has one of America 's biggest Arab allies in the Middle East . \nLEMON : And we are getting similar protest videos and iReports from across the U.S. and around the world . \nThis rally took place in downtown Montreal -- Atlanta , Chicago , New York , Los Angeles and many other places had similar demonstrations to show their support for the uprising in Egypt . \nWe 'll hear from them throughout this hour . \nSocial order and security have collapsed across Egypt 's largest cities . \nAs darkness falls , looting has become pervasive . \nAnd without police , many shopkeepers are arming themselves to protect their stores from looters . \nThere have also been conflicting reports about looting of priceless artifacts from the national museum . \nAnd right now , it appears the museum is secure . \nWe 'll let you know if we get any additional information about that . \nA lot of people are concerned about . \nWe 're also just now getting word from Nile TV that about 1,000 inmates have escaped from a large prison outside Cairo . \nCNN 's Ivan Watson has a live report from Cairo in just a moment on that . \nHe 's going to update us on that situation . \nSo , Michael , let me start with you . \nMichael is a Christian broadcaster here . \nHe is Michael Youssef . \nAnd you and your family came from Egypt 1997 . \nWhat do you make tonight as you see this drama unfold and you hear about the riot police and all of that ? \nMICHAEL YOUSSEF , CHRISTIAN BROADCASTER : I actually escaped from Egypt back in the '60s when I left . \nI came to the States in ' 77 . \nBut -- so , I know what dictatorship is lived under Nasser . \nAnd it 's really very disconcerting as I talk to several leaders in Egypt , Christian leaders and others , of the looting shops , banks . \nAnd so many young people are arming themselves because they ca n't have guns with sticks in order to defend their families and their possessions . \nIt 's really , very , very , very disconcerting . \nI was talking to an 80-year-old person who said , I 've never seen anything like it . \nLEMON : So , listen , you know , you said you escaped . \nIs it necessarily -- and , you know , maybe people in America for the most part will read this a certain way -- that Hosni Mubarak , if he is removed from power , is there some good to what Hosni Mubarak has done for Egypt ? \nYOUSSEF : Well , I personally think so . \nAnd everybody has a different perspective , you know ? \nNumber one , he was a war hero . \nHe is the one that led the Air Force at the Yom Kippur War . \nAnd so , the younger generations coming up -- I 'm 62 now . \nSo , I lived through the days of Nasser in the '60s , and saw the improvements that Mubarak made and I travel -- YOUSSEF : A lot of the economy . \nI mean , their economic growth is about 6.5 percent annually . \nAnd private enterprise , privatizing banks and companies and allowing more and more -- of course , not enough for young people to be able to have employment . \nI know that I had a driver who was a lawyer and he is making more money driving a car than practicing law . \nLEMON : He 's making more money . \nLEMON : But comparatively , it 's not a lot of money when you consider how much money most people make in Europe . \nLEMON : It does n't compare to the United States or most countries at all ? \nAnd inflation is humongous . \nIt 's a problem . \nLEMON : Here 's what -- why would one support Hosni Mubarak , who has lots of money , lots and lots of money , if you are living and you have to wait in queue to buy basic needs and get necessities . \nWhy would there be support for someone like that in the country ? \nYOUSSEF : I do n't know what kind of money he has . \nIt 's my -- I 'm not here to defend him . \nBut -- and I think , the people have every right to demonstrate . \nIt 's disconcerting the fact this turning into violence . \nLEMON : All right . \nStand by , Michael . \nI want to talk to you throughout the show . \nAnd a little bit later on , I want to go now to Ivan Watson who joins us now . \nHe is in Cairo . \nAnd he 's been watching this unfold . \nIvan , what are you seeing now ? \nAnd also , talk to me about the prisoners who have escaped there . \nIVAN WATSON , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Don , I 'm sorry . \nI could n't quite hear your question there . \nWe 've had some interruptions with the audio here . \nBasically , it 's now after 1:00 in the morning , 2:00 in the morning here . \nAnd the center of Cairo , the Egyptian capital , is quite calm . \nI do n't know if you can see over my shoulder . \nBut we 've got a number of army tanks parked here along the banks of the Nile , perhaps a reassuring sign for some residents of this sprawling city who are concerned by the disappearance of the police force after the battles that raged in these streets between the very unpopular police officers and demonstrators that resulted in basically the police evaporating overnight and not really having much of a presence at all in the city . \nSome fears of looting -- I 've seen stores and shops in residential areas that were looted over the course of the previous night . \nAnd that is a concern , maintaining law and order . \nAnd that is one of the arguments -- LEMON : That 's our Ivan Watson reporting to us live there in Cairo . \nAnd as you can see , we 're having a little bit of trouble with the satellite transmission . \nBut just a short while ago , Ivan went out and he witnessed firsthand what people are doing there and spoke to some of the protesters . \nWATSON : The crowds have gathered here . \nThey 're still chanting . \nThere 's a lot of elation . \nBut the curfew is coming fast . \nSo , we 're trying to ask people what are they going to do when they 're told to go indoors ? \nMadam , are you going to go inside when the curfew starts ? \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : No , I will not go inside , over my dead body . \nThey will kill me , no problem . \nWATSON : You 're going to stay out protesting ? \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : All of us , we will stay here . \nWATSON : It 's hard to put into words the scenes of elation that we 're seeing here with people hanging on the military 's tanks , riding through town . \nOne man said , as a result of today , I feel proud to be an Egyptian for the very first time , Chanting `` Down with the regime . '' \nBut there has been violence amid this carnival atmosphere . \nWe 've seen a number of people wounded , being treated by doctors on the dirty floor outside a mosque . \nMubarak -- -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- Mubarak . \nWATSON : We 're very excited right now and pretty upset because there 's been some shooting going on . \nThe doctor telling us five dead people have been brought into this entrance of this mosque and there 's one being treated right now with a bullet wound . \nThis has been a day of liberation for some . \nBut it 's also been a day of violence . \nAnd the doctors here at this restoration center , they say they 've been treating people coming in with wounds throughout the afternoon . \nWe 've heard about a number of gunshots . \nYou can see this young man being treated right here with some kind of wounds to his chest and arms . \nWATSON : The name of this square where this sea of chanting humanity has come to is called Tahrir Square . \nAnd the people here are celebrating a kind of freedom that many of them say they 've never felt before . \n-LRB- END VIDEOTAPE -RRB- LEMON : So , Ivan , you have been there watching this . \nAs the days go on , have you -- are more people coming out or does it appear to be dwindling ? \nWATSON : Well , no , certainly there were far more people in the streets today . \nBut we 've already moved into Sunday here . \nBut on Saturday , there were far more people than on Friday , in part because they did n't face opposition . \nThe police that had been attacking demonstrators prior to Saturday had left the scene and vacated the streets to the protesters , who are allowed to conduct themselves and chant and run around and have this festive atmosphere that was unfortunately tainted by some of these very bloody clashes that were going on just a few blocks away from where that carnival-like atmosphere was taking place . \nLEMON : Ivan Watson reporting to us from Cairo -- Ivan , thank you very much . \nI 'm joined here in Atlanta by Michael Youssef . \nHe has family there . \nYou escaped from Egypt in 1977 , you said that ? \nLEMON : Oh , my gosh . \nListen , can you talk to me real quickly about this prison where supposedly about 1,000 prisoners have escaped ? \nYOUSSEF : I just saw that on BBC that they announced that 1,000 prisoners escaped from what is known as Abuzaba -LRB- ph -RRB- Prison which is a very notorious prison . \nAnd they think those are the people who are out there looting and they actually bombed a bank and got into the safe . \nLEMON : And , again , they think those are the people -- I have been getting e-mails as well saying the protesters are really not the people who are looting . \nLEMON : Those are other people and we should make that distinction . \nYou 'll be joining us throughout the hour here . \nThank you so much . \nWe 're going to talk about this . \nComing up , our Nic Robertson shows what it 's like on the streets of Alexandria in the midst of a curfew . \nAnd later , there were a lot of angry protest here in the U.S. today and we 'll take you there . \nLEMON : The ancient port city of Alexandria has seen its own share of demonstrations and deadly clashes . \nAnd CNN 's senior international correspondent , Nic Robertson , has been in the thick of it all there . \nNIC ROBERTSON , CNN SR. . \nINTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : It 's now half an hour since security began . \nThis is one of the army trucks here ostensibly enforcing the curfew . \nEveryone is out on the street . \nAnd on the side of the truck -- hi guys -- from the side of the truck , Mubarak go instead . \nThis is the slogan on here , `` Mubarak , get out of the country . '' \nAnd this is painted on the truck of the army here . \nYou were telling me you 're a former general ? \nYou were a general , ex - general ? \nROBERTSON : So , you think that the army is out here to protect the president , not the people ? \nYes , to protect him . \nROBERTSON : Thank you very much indeed . \nIt 's very nice talking to you . \nYou have a handshake like a general , very strong . \nROBERTSON : Well , that 's just another opinion that we 're hearing on the streets here . \nPeople have been very friendly with the army so far . \nBut clearly , there 's a train of thought here that feels that the army is still at the moment really protecting the president and his interests rather than theirs . \nThey are all spoiled people . \nThey stole our land . \nThey stole our jobs . \nThey stole our future . \nROBERTSON : Thank you very much , sir . \nEveryone here wants to speak to us . \nEveryone has an opinion . \nAnd as you can see , some people would like to push to get their voices out and to get themselves on camera . \nBut despite that , it is quite relaxed and it is quite friendly . \nBut this is probably a good time to move on . \nIt 's almost getting to be night facility here in Alexandria now . \nThe people , very clear in what they 're saying . \nThey want President Mubarak to go . \nThey said , if he has any honor and dignity , then leave . \nAnd they also say , if you want to leave , go to Saudi Arabia . \nIt 's waiting for you . \nThis is the message the people are saying . \nI 'm making a report right now . \nWe 're making a video report right now . \nWhat do you want to say ? \n-LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- I will stay . \nROBERTSON : So , you think he 's going to stay ? \nHe can not have a curfew . \nWe are staying here . \nROBERTSON : You 're hearing it -- So , you 're hearing it from the streets right here . \nHe 's challenged the people by saying he 'll stay -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE : He wants to calm us down . \nROBERTSON : He wants to calm you down . \nThat 's not calming us down . \nROBERTSON : That 's not calming you down . \nAnd that 's what we 're seeing here . \nPeople angry and they 're saying right now that he must go . \nROBERTSON : The trend continues to be the same . \nWe want him out . \nWe want him gone . \nMubarak has to go . \nThat 's the message that comes out . \nThe electronic part of the revolution here goes on . \nEveryone here almost is carrying their cell phone filming what 's going on , propagating their message around the country . \nThe voices here in Alexandria are just getting louder and louder . \nThere are people here now , like this gentleman , who are helping control the crowds . \nBut the message now is getting louder and perhaps a little more controlled . \nLEMON : That was CNN 's Nic Robertson . \nProtesters in the U.S. express outrage over the situation in Egypt , including right here in Atlanta at a rally that I covered . \nThat 's coming up next . \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : What 's happening to our president ? \nHe said , `` I will change everything . '' \nWe do n't want him . \nHe 's the one -- he should go out . \nWe do n't want him here because he 's not responsible about all this here . \nLEMON : A show of solidarity with the Egyptian protesters in cities around the country . \nIn New York , hundreds gathered outside the United Nations to show their support . \nThey shouted slogans and waved signs , but the rally was a peaceful one . \nLEMON : And in Washington , a similar scene outside the Egyptian embassy there . \nAfterward , the group marched to the White House where President Obama held a meeting with his national security team today . \nAnd in Atlanta , demonstrators held a rally right in the front of CNN 's headquarters . \nWe went out there and found that much of the anger -- much of their anger over the situation in Egypt is actually directed at the U.S. government . \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : We 've got to help out the people . \nMUSTAFA MAZHER , PROTESTER : If there 's no sort of democracy that we 're promoting here , that 's in the Middle East and it 's not represented over there , we 're not doing our job here . \nWe 're supporting a government over there that 's been in power for 30 years . \nSEAN PHILLIPS , PROTESTER : I do n't think that the Egyptian people will be free until they take down Mubarak . \nLEMON : -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- said `` U.S. ` aid ' equals tear gas . '' \nWhat does that mean ? \nAHMED NAZEEM , PROTESTER : Yes . \nThis is the military , they are giving to Egypt . \nThey are supporting that corrupted regime by giving them money and these weapons to be used against the Egyptian people . \nAnd we want the U.S. to stop supporting these dictatorships and give the opportunity to the Egyptians to elect the leaders . \nLEMON : This sign says Americans should be aware of that ? \nSAMI ALMALFOUH , PROTESTER : Of course . \nThey should know that their money is not being used building democracy . \nIt 's been used to oppress the people . \nIt 's quite the opposite of what 's the purpose of the U.S. funds . \nIt goes for a different message , sends a different message . \nThe U.S. aid for the military today to Egypt is $ 1.3 billion . \nThe economy is $ 250 million only . \nSo , if you compare that to that , that 's the point -- that 's the point of this sign , is that we want aid , of course , to build infrastructure and build -- kind of let the people , you know , live a normal life and have a real democracy . \nSAMEH ABDELAZIZ , PROTEST ORGANIZER : We 're not here to try to talk to Mubarak 's government . \nWe gave up on this a long time ago . \nWe 're here to talk to our government , the American government , to ask them to stay true to our American principles of democracy and freedom by standing beside the Egyptian people that are dying in the little towns and villages over there . \nSHERYFALI MOUSA , PROTESTER : President Mubarak has been there for 30 years . \nWe want him out . \nLEMON : Just one of the many protests here in the U.S. and around the world . \nComing up next here on CNN : CNN 's Fred Pleitgen shows us what it was like on the streets in downtown Cairo with no security . \nLEMON : Looters are taking advantage of the chaos in the streets of Cairo . \nSecurity forces seem to have disappeared , leaving people to fend for themselves . \nOur Frederik Pleitgen met up with some who are spending the night guarding their own property because no one else will -- Fred . \nFREDERIK PLEITGEN , CNN SR. . \nINTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : While there 's a lot of security presence and army in the downtown area of Cairo , if you get out of the downtown area , large parts of the city are basically without any security forces . \nSo , we 've seen a lot of people here who are banding together to try and protect their property , protect their homes , protect their families . \nNo one to prevent this . \nPLEITGEN : What happened to the police ? \nPLEITGEN : How long are you going to stay out here ? \nPLIETGEN : And you guys -- are you guys -- are you guys sort of all friends ? \nAre you one family ? \nHow does this work -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE : I have my cousins that live with me . \nI have my neighbors . \nWe have our friends , neighbors down there . \nWe 're all like one community to prevent the whole street -- the whole area . \nPLEITGEN : To prevent people from coming in here . \nPLEITGEN : And you 're getting no help at this point , from the police actually ? \nPLEITGEN : The people tell us that guys like this , guys on the motorcycles , those are usually the ones who are doing the looting . \nNow , we 've seen some who have passed by here carrying real samurai swords on their motorcycles . \nNow , every time those motorcycles pass , obviously , the guys here from the community watch . \nThey come out and they threaten them and tell them , do n't stop here . \nIt clearly is a very , very difficult situation with a lot of uncertainty for the people in the Egyptian capital . \nLEMON : Many pictures of really what some say is chaos ; others say it 's organized protest . \nLet 's bring in Dr. Michael Youssef . \nYou 're sitting here . \nYou 're watching our coverage all evening . \nAs you look at these reports , does this indicate anything to you about whether this is going to ramp up or slow down ? \nToo soon to tell ? \nYOUSSEF : It is too soon to tell , really very hard . \nThis is absolutely new to the Egyptian experience . \nOld and young alike that I talk to , they just really do n't know . \nThere is a hope , of course , with the appointment of a vice president that maybe -- and I have a feeling that Mubarak really did not want to run . \nLEMON : But the keyword there is appointment . \nLEMON : It is an appointment by someone who would be seem the masses want out . \nWell , that 's how it worked . \nNasser appointed Sadat as vice president . \nSadat appointed Mubarak as vice president . \nThat 's just how it sort works over there . \nHe has to appoint a vice president so that he can be a transition -- a peaceful transition of power , because if he 's going to say , we 're going to have an election for a vice president in midst of this chaos , it 's really is unlikely . \nLEMON : So would it be - they 're saying step down , we want you out . \nNot a good move , you believe ? \nYOUSEF : Not now . \nThere has to be a timetable . \nThere has to be an opportunity for a transition of power . \nTo leave just now , there is no floor under the system that can catch it . \nThere will be just street mob rule . \nIn fact , I 've written about this on my Michael Yousef.com blog . \nBecause it 's very important for people to understand - it 's not like here where - LEMON : There is n't street mob rule happening right now , though ? \nYOUSEF : It is . \nIt 's going to be far worse if he just leaves the country like the Tunisian president did . \nBut if he brings in people that he begin to trust and hand over the power , maybe in the next several months he 'll be able to just retire and enjoy the rest of his life . \nLEMON : All right . \nWe have more coverage . \nBecause our coverage of the uprising in Egypt is going to continue here on CNN . \nWe 'll have a live report on the latest from Cairo . \nAnd we 'll talk with a few Egyptian Americans here in Atlanta . \nI had the pleasure of meeting them just last night . \nSTEVE PERRY , CNN EDUCATION CONTRIBUTOR -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : The legend of Franco Harris is growing here in Pittsburgh , not just because he won four Super Bowls for the Steelers but for the work that he 's now doing with an education foundation called the Pittsburgh Promise . \nFRANCO HARRIS , THE PITTSBURGH PROMISE : This is the chance for so many kids who have an opportunity like myself even though I did n't plan to go to college , it was a great experience there , I was able to pursue my passion and profession in football and then afterward I was able to use my education to go into business . \nHARRIS : We will give up to $ 5,000 a year . \nHARRIS : Any school in the state of Pennsylvania . \nPERRY -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Saleem Ghubril has served as executive director of the Promise since it started in 2007 . \n-LRB- on camera -RRB- : How many kids so far in just three years ? \nSALEEM GHUBRIL , EXEC . \n, THE PITTSBURGH PROMISE : In three years , we have sent 2,500 kids to college . \nPERRY : Where is this money coming from ? \nGHUBRIL : In order for us to honor that promise , it 's going to require raising $ 250 million . \nOur largest employer in Pittsburgh is UPMC , University of Pittsburgh Medical Center . \nWhen we approached them with this idea , they jumped on it right away . \nPERRY -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Vanessa Thompson is now a junior at Chatham University in Pittsburgh . \n-LRB- on camera -RRB- : What -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- to you now ? \nVANESSA THOMPSON , SCHOLARSHIP RECIPIENT : It means that I can get places that I never thought that I could before so I can dream bigger . \nPERRY -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Steve Perry , Pittsburgh . \nNo work here , no eat , no independence . \nAll people are very tired for that . \nWe need a change . \nI wanted to send the message to America . \nPlease do n't help Mubarak . \nBecause Mubarak , he will go . \nWe hate his current system . \n-LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- Why is this fire still going right now ? \nBecause we do n't like him . \nAll Egyptians , we do n't like it this way . \nWe hate him , OK ? \nAnd anyhow he will quit . \n-LRB- END VIDEO CLIP -RRB- LEMON : A popular uprising in Egypt that threatens to bring down the presidency of Hosni Mubarak is now in its fifth day . \nDozens of people have died in violent clashes with riot police over the past week . \nMany others have been hurt . \nHere you see the body of one victim carried today through the streets of Cairo . \nOne major change is the disappearance of riot police . \nNow military troops and vehicles fill parts of Cairo for the most part , the military and civilians have avoided clashing with each other . \nProtests are spreading to cities around the world . \nImpassioned Egyptian Americans gathered in Washington today calling for the removal of Egypt 's president . \nThey rallied first at the Egyptian embassy and then marched to the White House . \nAnd inside the White House , President Obama huddled with his national security team to discuss the crisis . \nJoining me now is Michael Yousef , he 's here this hour . \nAnd he 's a Christian broadcaster who moved here from Egypt more than 30 years ago . \nAnd we got Ivan Watson standing by live for us in Cairo . \nFirst to you , Mr. Yousef , why not a full democracy there ? \nYOUSEF : Well , you have to understand , in my blog , michaelyousef.com , I explained how the concept of democracy is really a western concept . \nWe believe that the power rises from the people . \nAnd we the people empower government to rule . \nThat 's why - YOUSEF : Well , at least it 's working here . \nIn fact , Washington and - LEMON : Yes , but has that worked there ? \nIt 's not working there . \nSo why not a full democracy because there are people who say Hosni Mubarak is not that bad , he 's not that bad for the country . \nWho would believe that when people are in - there are so many people in poverty there ? \nYOUSEF : Sure , but there are many people who have moved from poverty into a middle class , too . \nI 'm not defending him , believe me . \nI know some of the things that needed to be done that were not done . \nAnd I think a change is in the air , with him or without him . \nBut at least he permitted the political parties to operate freely , have their own newspapers . \n-LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- Sadat allowed that to happen . \nLEMON : Well , comparatively . \nIf you compare them to those two people . \nLet 's go now live to Cairo and go to CNN 's Ivan Watson . \nIvan , you have been watching all of this unfold . \nWhat are you seeing now ? \nIVAN WATSON , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : Well , right now , the streets are pretty calm and it 's after 2:00 in the morning . \nThere are a number of Egyptian army tanks that have been conducting patrols and parking in major intersections , kind of trying to maintain law and order . \nYou know , Don , as we talked about this , there 's one theme that 's come out over the course of the day repeatedly as I meet demonstrators or just passers-by . \nWhen they often - Egyptians ask where I 'm from , I say , I 'm an American citizen . \nOne of the first things they say is , `` you are welcome , you are welcome . '' \nIt 's a sincere response that you get from Egyptians . \nBut then you 'll often hear a second message . \nOne taxi driver told me , tell America to stop supporting this expletive government , meaning the presidency of Hosni Mubarak , of course . \nAnd I 've seen signs around saying , you know , effectively , `` Obama , stop supporting this government '' and with the argument that an estimated $ 2 billion a year of U.S. aid comes to the Egyptian government . \nMore than $ 1 billion of that money , according to a WikiLeaks report , going in direct military aid to the Egyptian military and help prop up a regime that 's been in place for some 30 years that is now feeling a real challenge , one of the most severe challenges it has faced in 30 years as a result of these demonstrators who clearly want the strongest ally to the Mubarak government to take a step back right now and listen to the voice of the Egyptian people . \nLEMON : Ivan , stand by . \nWe 're not done with you yet . \nAs you listen to that , Mr. Yousef , that 's a very good point . \nAs I was out there today , people said , the cans of the tear gas , it says , right there Made in the USA . \nSome of the ammunition from the weapons , whatever , the U.S. is supporting a government basically that is not for the people . \nYOUSEF : Well , now they 're saying it 's not for the people . \nWhere have they been for 30 years ? \nWhere have they been for 50 years ? \nI mean , at least they are able to go down in the street and say things . \nPapers have been able to attack Mubarak for the past 10 , 15 years . \nLEMON : So the papers but Mubarak and the government did not want these people out there . \nThat 's why the military was sent out . \nHe did n't want the people out protesting . \nHe shut off the internet . \nHe shut off the lines of communication . \nIt 's not a free democracy where these people are allowed . \nHe does n't want this at all . \nOf course , he is protecting his turf . \nI 'm not , again , defending him . \nI 'm just saying that he has done so much in terms of allowing these voices to speak . \nWhen I was a young man living there under Nasser , you could never dream of getting down in the street and attacking the government . \nLEMON : Your point is things are getting better . \nAnd Ivan Watson , in Cairo , things are getting better , according to him , but things are n't according to where these people , these protesters you have been seeing - it 's not to where they would like it to be ? \nAnd I think what you could do is point to the most recent round of elections in Egypt , at the end of November and early December , parliamentary elections which were denounced not only by international observers but even by the U.S. State Department saying that there were real problems with those elections , allegations of fraud , that the Egyptian government was n't allowing independent international observers to watch that - those elections . \nAnd in the second round of those parliamentary elections , Don , the two main opposition parties boycotted the vote because they saw that that election was rigged , was basically a farce . \nThe main ruling party got , by some estimate , more than 90 percent of the seats in the current parliament . \nThat was seen as a big step back for Egypt as far as electoral democracy goes . \nAnd one of the recurring themes I 've heard from people in the streets is here , `` we want to be able to choose our own leader . \nAfter 30 years , we deserve that right , '' Don ? \nLEMON : Ivan Watson in Cairo . \nIvan , thank you very much . \nEgyptian Americans share their thoughts and concerns about the uprising in Egypt , next . \nI do n't know -- are they even alive or not ? \nI do n't know what is happening . \nLEMON : This is a moment of upheaval for the people of Egypt but it 's also a time of hope and anxiety for Egyptian Americans who have to watch all of this unfold from thousands of miles away . \nWe met Mustafa -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- and some others while they were having a dinner at Sultan 's restaurant in Atlanta . \nAnd here 's what we talked about just last night . \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : My concern is the safety of the people there . \nThe people - the young people especially . \nI do n't think the bloodshed will be there . \nLEMON -LRB- on camera -RRB- : When you finally get through on a land line and you talk to your relatives , what 's their state of mind like ? \nWhat do they say about all this ? \nYou know , they feel that they are - UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : Because they do n't know what 's going to happen . \nLEMON : As you watch Mubarak 's speech , what did you think ? \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : Let the people rule . \nLet the people choose who they want . \nLEMON : And you said it was almost as if it 's a joke for you ? \nIt is a joke because he does not understand , I mean , he obviously either does n't understand Arabic or he has n't been watching TV because people are going out and saying `` no '' to Mubarak . \nLEMON : You think it 's over ? \nLEMON : What does this mean to me ? \nWhy am I interested in what 's happening in Tunisia , in Cairo ? \nWhat does it matter to me ? \nThis region has control of oil and that 's a big factor . \nLEMON : Are you hopeful , Hannah ? \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : Yes , I hope everything will go well . \nNot only for Egypt but for the entire region . \nGet out of Egypt . \nWe do n't need you . \nWe do n't want you here in Egypt . \n-LRB- END VIDEO CLIP -RRB- LEMON : As we continue our coverage here the response , the revolt in Egypt has been overwhelming on cnn.com . \nNumerous I-reports have come in showing images of our viewers that have taken , what they 're experiencing there , that they have taken and show us what they 're experiencing from Egypt to Europe and elsewhere around the world , including here in the United States . \nEgyptian American Nancy Mousa is an i-reporter with several dozen relatives in Egypt . \nShe lives in Atlanta and visited Egypt just last October . \nSo why did you upload your video on I-report ? \nNANCY MOUSA , EGYPTIAN AMERICAN JOURNALIST : You know , I felt , Don , that it was very important that everyone knew what was truly happening there . \nI know that Hosni Mubarak has limited the media , information that was being leaked to the United States and I needed to make sure I was able to let everyone in the United States know what my family members were telling me . \nWe 're going to take a look at some of the most compelling images that have come in here . \nSo here 's one I-report from Switzerland of people condemning Hosni Mubarak at a rally . \nLEMON : So , Nancy , what are they saying and when you were in Egypt , did you see any signs of what they are talking about ? \nWhat are they saying ? \nMOUSA : In that i-report , they were talking about in Egypt here , we do not want the president here anymore . \nWe want to get rid of you . \nWe do n't want you . \nLEMON : We do n't want you . \nMOUSA : When I was in Egypt last October it was around election time and , you know , I saw all kinds of corruption within the government . \nI had a distant relative who was running to be a member of parliament there , and he was actually taken off of the ballot . \nSomebody bribed somebody in the government and he was taken off the ballot . \nLEMON : I want to talk now , sitting next to you is Moustafa Mokhemar , one of the people I spoke to last night at the restaurant . \nWe had a very interesting conversation . \nAs you watch all of this 24 hours later from our talk , what do you think ? \nMOUSTAFA MOKHEMAR , EGYPTIAN AMERICAN : I think Mubarak should leave and Mubarak has no place now . \nWhatever he did wo n't solve the problem because , again , we have military - LEMON : Moustafa , you disagree with what the doctor said earlier , what Dr. Yousef - I could n't agree more with him , why ? \nMOKHEMAR : Because he said he gives the media freedom . \nThat 's limited freedom . \nYes , he gives them freedom to talk but he makes them angry so they ca n't talk . \nLEMON : And you agree , you are sitting here going , why ? \nMOUSA : He does n't give them freedom at all . \nI think that 's ridiculous as a very perception . \nThat 's very false . \nThe people in Egypt - I 'm very proud of them that they are rebelling right now because he limits what people can say . \nLEMON : Yes , all right . \nWell , thanks to both of you . \nWe really appreciate it . \nWe 're going to talk a little bit more here . \nWe 're going to move on and talk about how the U.S. is reacting to the development in Egypt and what 's the next move . \nLet 's bring in our CNN State Department producer , Elise Labott . \nSo what is going on ? \nWhat 's next for the United States ? \nELISE LABOTT , CNN STATE DEPARTMENT PRODUCER : Well , Don , the president has been meeting with his national security team and members of the cabinet have been meeting today really trying to decipher what to do next . \nAs you remember President Obama gave President Mubarak a pretty tough message yesterday . \nJust reshuffling the cabinet is not enough . \nWe really want to see meaningful change . \nAnd now talking to officials in the administration they want to see that change . \nThey 're not going to cut Mubarak loose , so to speak , and call for him to leave . \nThey 're going to give him some time to institute some of those changes . \nThey want to see a national dialogue with the opposition . \nThey want to see steps at job creation and I think they 're going to give them some time before they step up their rhetoric and talk about other leverage they can use such as U.S. aid . \nBut they are watching this very seriously . \nThey do n't know who would come in his stead . \nIf he were to leave , there 's really no rallying figure at the opposition they can deal with . \nAnd so they 're really concerned for what is coming next . \nSo I think they 're hedging their bets a little bit . \nWhat happens if he stays ? \nLEMON : Elise , stand by . \nI 'm getting some strong reaction from the folks here . \nYou say what to that ? \nMOKHEMAR : I think there is no way for Mubarak to clean his mess now after 30 years . \nHe is 82 years old . \nWhat change will he make now after 30 years ? \nLEMON : Then what would you like to see ? \nShe is specifically talking about the Obama administration , our government , watching this very closely . \nWhat should they do ? \nMOKHEMAR : I understand what Obama , President Obama , trying to do because there is nobody can come in to take over . \nBut that 's another problem because Mubarak in the era of Mubarak he did n't bring any people to learn about the politics . \nLEMON : So I say why should n't he resign and Mr. Yousef said it would be complete chaos if he resigned . \nDo you agree with that ? \nMOKHEMAR : What would be more chaos than that ? \nLEMON : You said to me that you believe in six months that there would be an election and that he would step down . \nHe has n't gone anywhere . \nHe will step out this week . \nI believe strongly of that . \nLEMON : Elise Labott , back to you again . \nThe Obama administration is watching this . \nWhat is the next move for the Obama administration ? \nLABOTT : Well , I think they 're going to give some time for this to play out , to see what President Mubarak does . \nIf he does n't take some steps , I think they 're going to talk about possible withdrawal , or holding , suspending U.S. aid . \nBut Don , to answer your guests , I think that they 're really trying to walk a very fine line right now . \nBecause clearly they see that change is coming in Egypt and they really want to be on the right side of history , be on the right side of the aspirations of the Egyptian people but at the same time they do n't know how this is going to play out . \nIt 's very possible in their eyes that President Mubarak does stay in power and so , as I said , they 're hedging their bets . \nThey really do n't want to alienate him and close the channel to future reform if they close the channel and he is still in power . \nLEMON : All right . \nElise , that 's going to be the last word . \nWe have to run . \nWe 're out of time here . \nThanks to my guests here , Nancy and Moustafa and Elise Labott in Washington as well . \nI 'm Don Lemon at CNN World headquarters in Atlanta . \nOur coverage of the `` Crisis in Egypt '' continues with Wolf Blitzer after the break . \n"}

'' \nTens of thousands emboldened to join protests Saturday -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Defiance and hope replaced Friday 's scenes of widespread chaos and violence in Cairo on Saturday but at least five people were reported dead in clashes between police and protesters outside the Interior Ministry building . \nCNN 's Ian Lee said a `` firefight '' was going on around the ministry as protesters attempted to charge the building . \nLee said he had seen one protester shot in the head as police cordoned off the area and fired shots down side streets . \nAt least five people died from gunshot wounds , according to a physician at a triage center in a Cairo mosque . \nCNN 's Frederick Pleitgen said the Interior Ministry building was a symbol of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak 's regime and had become a `` flashpoint '' for confrontations between protesters and security forces . \nEarlier , tens of thousands of protesters were `` losing their fear '' and taking to the streets in unprecedented numbers , emboldened by rumors that Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak may soon step down , Pleitgen said . \nNew vice president appointed in Egypt Protesters : ` We want Mubarak out , NOW !

'' \n`` Nothing short of a complete change is what they want , and there are no signs of them dispersing , '' said Pleitgen . \nOn streets where demonstrators had police clashed on Friday , protesters shook hands with soldiers and shouted `` The people and the military , we are one .

'' \nMubarak gave no indication that he would step down or leave the country . \n`` I assure you that I 'm working for the people and giving freedoms of opinion as long as you 're respecting the law , '' he said . \n`` There is very little line between freedom and chaos . '' \nAt the same time , Mubarak said that `` these protests arose to express a legitimate demand for more democracy , need for a greater social safety net , and the improvement of living standards , fighting poverty and rampant corruption . '' \n`` I understand these legitimate demands of the people and I truly understand the depth of their worries and burdens and I will not part from them ever and I will work for them everyday , '' he said . \n`` But regardless of what problems we face , this does not justify violence or lawlessness . '' \nEgypt 's president asks gov n't to resign Police van slams into protester Protester shot during Egypt clashes It 's clear , the official said -- speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter -- that Mubarak believes he can ride this out , `` and this time , we 're not so sure that is the right assumption . '' \nAdministration officials had hoped Mubarak would promise an immediate and open dialogue , the official said . \nThe streets of downtown Cairo appeared to calm somewhat overnight Friday as the army -- a much more respected force than police among Egyptian civilians -- took control of the country . \nThe army was much less aggressive with protesters than the police had been , and many Egyptians applauded the arrival of its tanks in Cairo , Alexandria and elsewhere . \nOne of the key questions ahead of sunrise in Egypt on Saturday is whether people will continue to welcome the army as a protective force or reject it as a tool of Mubarak . \nCelebratory crowds that had gathered overnight Friday ahead of Mubarak 's speech , expecting him to announce his resignation , quickly transformed into street demonstrations when the president announced he was staying put . \nThe government cracked down throughout Friday with thousands of riot and plainclothes police , later joined by army troops in tanks and armored personnel carriers equipped with gun turrets . \nUndeterred , people ran , screamed , hurled rocks and accosted walls of security as they tried to make their way to central Cairo . \nAnti-government demonstrators have taken to the streets in Egypt since Tuesday to demand an end to Mubarak 's rule . \nThe protests come weeks after similar disturbances sparked a revolution in Tunisia , forcing then-president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali to flee the country . \nBoth Egypt and Tunisia have seen dramatic rises in the cost of living in recent years and accusations of corruption among the ruling elite . \nIn downtown Cairo , a calm seemed to be settling in overnight Friday amid little sign of authority . \n`` There is no authority ... there 's nobody to protest against , '' CNN 's Ben Wedeman said , speaking of the capital 's downtown area . \n`` State authority in much of downtown Cairo has disappeared . '' \nMubarak imposed a nationwide curfew from 6 p.m. Friday to 7 a.m. Saturday . \nState-run Nile TV said the curfew was in response to the `` hooliganism and lawlessness '' of the protesters . \nVans packed with riot police circled Cairo neighborhoods before the start of weekly prayers in the afternoon . \nLater in the day , Egyptian soldiers moved onto the streets , the first time the army has been deployed to quell unrest since 1985 . \nBut protesters defied all warnings to demand an end to Mubarak 's authoritarian 30-year-rule . \nThey chanted `` God is Great '' and that the dictator must go . \n`` Down , Down , Mubarak , '' they shouted . \nPlumes of rancid , thick smoke billowed over the Nile River as , by nightfall , chaos reigned in the bustling metropolis . \nThe headquarters of the ruling National Democratic Party was ablaze Friday night . \nNile TV said protesters ransacked the building and set it afire . \nPolice fired water cannons , rubber bullets and tear gas with force and impunity . \nA tourist on the balcony of his 18th floor hotel room told CNN he had to run in and wash his eyes and face from the stinging gas . \nPolice confiscated cameras from people , including guests at the Hilton Hotel . \nAt least six people have died in the demonstrations this week , according to Egypt 's Interior Ministry . \nBut Nile TV reported Friday that 13 have died and 75 were injured in Suez , south of Cairo , citing medical sources As the government cracked down on protesters across Egypt , opposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei , who returned home to Cairo to join the demonstrations , was placed under house arrest , a high-level security source told CNN . \nElBaradei , a Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the United Nations ' nuclear watchdog agency , was warned earlier not to leave a mosque near downtown Cairo where he was attending Friday prayers . \nWhite House press secretary Robert Gibbs said that the U.S. is reviewing its aid to Egypt `` based on events now and in the coming days . '' \nU.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton addressed the Egyptian crisis Friday , urging all parties to be peaceful and engage in dialogue . \n`` We are deeply concerned about the use of violence by Egyptian police and security forces against protesters and we call on the Egyptian government to do everything within its power to restrain its security forces , '' Clinton said . \n`` At the same time , protesters should also refrain from violence and express themselves peacefully . '' \nThe protests sent ripples around the world , with stocks plunging on news of Egypt unrest . \nThe Dow dropped 166 points on Friday , its largest loss since November . \nThe State Department urged Americans to defer all non-essential travel to Egypt and within the country . \nDelta Air Lines said its last flight from Cairo will depart Saturday ; all other Cairo service was indefinitely suspended , said spokeswoman Susan Elliott . \nAmerican Airlines and British Airways will allow customers with tickets between Friday and Monday to or from Cairo to change their flights at no charge , according American Airlines spokesman Edward Martelle . \nEgypt is the most populous nation in the Arab world and often a barometer for sentiment on the Arab community . \n`` What happens in Egypt will have an impact throughout the Arab world and the Middle East , '' said Edward Djerejian , a former U.S. ambassador to Israel and Syria . \nIn the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria on Friday , at least 1,000 protesters gathered and youths hurled rocks through black clouds of gas . \nCrowds ran through the streets toward the city 's central square . \nThere was no indication of a curfew in that city either , as people remained out well after the time it was to begin . \nIn Suez , 15,000 riot police were out , using tear gas to disperse crowds , Nile TV said . \nRiot police also confronted protesters in the cities and towns of Ismailia , Fayoum and Shbin Elkoum , according to the anti-government group Egyptian Liberation . \nA CNN crew covering the clashes in Cairo felt the wrath of the police . \nCNN 's Wedeman and Mary Rogers were under an overpass and behind a column as police tried to hold back protesters . \nPlainclothes police wielding clubs surrounded the CNN team and wanted `` to haul us off , '' Wedeman said . \nIn a struggle , police grabbed Rogers 's camera , cracked its viewfinder , and confiscated it . \nWedeman said the police threatened to beat them . \nEgypt 's Interior Ministry forbade protests Friday , but some Egyptians went door to door in Cairo , urging their neighbors to participate . \nThe main opposition bloc , the Muslim Brotherhood , urged its supporters for the first time to take to the streets . \nHours ahead of the protests , the internet went dark in many parts of the country . \nSome text messaging and cell phone services appeared to be blocked . \nEven though it was difficult to use Twitter and Facebook within Egypt , thousands of others outside the country ran with the powerful social media tool to provide a real-time chronology of events . \n`` Mubarak '' was a trending topic . \nAuthorities arrested a prominent Muslim Brotherhood leader early Friday , detaining the party 's main speaker , Issam al-Aryan , according to a relative . \nOther government critics voiced their opinions -- amazingly -- on state-run television . \nA popular morning show on state-run Nile TV included comments from guests calling for the resignation of government officials and increased dialogue between authorities and arrested protesters . \nThe network carried coverage of the protests , even at times calling them large and peaceful . \nThey followed days of unrest that have roiled several Arab countries . \nDemonstrations in Tunisia were followed by protests in Algeria , Egypt , Yemen and Jordan . \n`` They all want the same , '' said Emile Hokayem of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in the Middle East , speaking of protesters in different Arab countries . \n`` They 're all protesting about growing inequalities , they 're all protesting against growing nepotism . \nThe top of the pyramid was getting richer and richer . '' \nPeople are also fed up with authoritarian regimes that do not afford the people proper representation . \nMubarak has not been seen in public for some time . \nHe is 82 and there has been speculation of failing health . \nMany Egyptians believe Mubarak is grooming his son , Gamal , as his successor , a plan that could be complicated by demands for democracy . \nCNN 's Nic Robertson , Frederik Pleitgen , Salma Abdelaziz , Housam Ahmed and Caroline Faraj contributed to this report . \n"}

'' \nWe do n't want him . \nHe 's the one -- he should go out . \nWe do n't want him here because he 's not responsible about all of this here . \nThe people are poor . \nOne year , I live here . \nI 'm fed up . \nIt 's difficult for me . \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : Forty-three years in Saudi Arabia . \nI feel it 's easy life . \nHere , it 's very difficult for us . \nWATSON : Are you happy today ? \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : I am happy because everybody -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- in here . \nBefore , I thought there is no many -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- in Egypt . \nNow , when I saw all this , I feel , yes , we can change . \nWe do n't want Hosni Mubarak . \nWe do n't want him . \nWATSON : And , Wolf , here you have this fascinating contradiction where you have real hatred and loathing for the government of President Hosni Mubarak , who 's been in power for nearly 30 years . \nAnd , at the same time , elation and joy , pride even , coming from the fact Egyptians finally are able to express that hatred , have that freedom to really lash out and speak their minds perhaps for the first time for many of them in their lifetime -- Wolf . \nBLITZER : What do we know , Ivan , about the breaking news that 1,000 , at least several hundred , maybe as many as 1,000 prisoners escaped from that Fayoum prison outside of Cairo and are out on the streets right now ? \nWATSON : At this predawn stage , we pretty much only have what Nile TV itself has reported , Wolf . \nAs you said about 1,000 people . \nAnd that 's going to be very disturbing news for Egyptians who are worried . \nNot all of the demonstrators -- not all of the Egyptians are demonstrators . \nI 've spoken to some Egyptians who were quite worried as what they see as a threat of breakdown of law and order . \nOne of the chief fears coming is that , yes , many people do not like the police force here but now that they 're gone , they 're hearing about armed groups or robbers moving around invading houses , looting shops . \nI 've seen a number of burned and looted shops just within the past 24 hours and some Egyptians who are unable to go back to their homes because of a `` dusk until dawn '' curfew , very worried they can not protect their families at home from any possible thieves , robbers and criminals that may be out there . \nAnd a prison break is only going to make that worse . \nBLITZER : Yes , it 's a dangerous situation all around . \nIvan , we 'll stay in close touch . \nBe careful over there . \nSESAY : Well , Wolf , in the port city of Alexandria , what started as relatively calm protests grew much more intense . \nCNN 's senior international correspondent Nic Robertson has been in the thick of things on the ground . \nNIC ROBERTSON , CNN SR. . \nINTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : It 's almost getting to be nightfall here in Alexandria now . \nThe people are very clear in what they 're saying . \nThey want President Mubarak to go . \nThey said , if he got any honor and dignity , then leave . \nAnd they 're also saying , if you want to leave , then go to Saudi Arabia . \nIt 's waiting for you . \nThis is the message the people are saying . \nI 'm making a report right now . \nWe 're making a video report right now . \nWhat do you want to say ? \nROBERTSON : So , you think he 's going to stay ? \nHe can not have a curfew . \nWe are staying here . \nROBERTSON : So , you 're hearing it -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE : He 's not the president anymore . \nSo , you 're hearing it from the streets right here . \nHe 's challenged the people by saying he 'll stay -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE : He wants to calm us down . \nROBERTSON : He wants to calm you down . \nROBERTSON : By saying that he will stay . \nROBERTSON : That 's not calming you down . \nAnd that 's what we 're seeing here . \nPeople angry and they 're saying right now that he must go . \nOur national security analyst Peter Bergen is here once again with his take on five straight days of violent protests across Egypt . \nWhy do you think the police , for all practical purposes , have abandoned their post ? \nThe military is still involved . \nBut he police which these protesters despise , they simply disappeared . \nPETER BERGEN , CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST : I think the word `` despise '' is the important one . \nI think that they understand that they 're held in great disdain by their own population for very good reason . \nWolf , you may recall that there was a widely circulated videotape of a group of police officers sodomizing somebody who just was involved in a traffic accident . \nThis circulated on the Internet . \nThis kind of material has obviously turned the population even more against the security forces for whom they 've long had a disdain for . \nThey know that the security forces have tortured literally thousands of people almost on every given year . \nThe State Department releases a report excoriating the Egyptian security -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- , this treatment of their own people , who are tortured for almost any reason . \nIf you go into -- there is no forensic techniques other than beating people up in these police stations . \nBLITZER : Can the Mubarak government survive right now ? \nWe know a new vice president was named today ; a new prime minister was named today . \nBoth with heavy military backgrounds . \nCan this government of President Mubarak -- can he survive ? \nBERGEN : Personally , I do n't think so . \nBut history has a way of surprising us and revolutions are inherently unpredictable . \nYou know , he might be able to manage his departure in such a way that it is n't , you know , on a plane to exile very quickly . \nObviously , he retains -- seems to retain some kind of hold over the military . \nBut , you know , frankly , wolf , I have no idea . \nAnd no one else really does . \nIt 's a very fluid situation as the State Department likes to say right now . \nBut there 's this weird picture that we see , these demonstrators out there , and they 're almost celebrating together with soldiers on tanks , armored vehicles . \nIt 's as if they are one . \nAt least some of those pictures . \nBERGEN : There 's a good reason that the Egyptian military is held in pretty high esteem . \nI mean -- BLITZER : As opposed to the police . \nBERGEN : As opposed to the police . \nI mean , this is , you know , the army has done relatively well on occasion against Egypt 's enemies . \nOf course , Mubarak himself comes out of a military background . \nThis -- you know , the officer class enjoys a certain privilege , a place in Egyptian society , and is n't seen to be part of cracking down on the population . \nBLITZER : There you see pictures of some of the demonstrators on a tank , on an Egyptian military tank . \nAll right , stand by . \nWe 're going to get back to you , Peter Bergen . \nSESAY : Well , Wolf , the big question many are considering now is could Egyptians be near their breaking point ? \nAn Egyptian student living here in the United States gives me his reaction to what he 's seeing in his homeland . \nGet out , Mubarak . \nGet out of Egypt . \nWe do n't -- we do n't need you . \nWe do n't -- we do n't want you in Egypt . \nBLITZER : The protests are spreading beyond the streets of Egypt . \nWe watched rallies all over the world today . \nFirst , New York City , hundreds demonstrated outside the United Nations in support of the uprising . \nEmotions ran high but the protests remained peaceful . \nHere in Washington protesters , many Egyptian-American filled the streets in front of the Egyptian embassy . \nDemonstrators also criticized President Obama 's response . \nIn Atlanta , across from the CNN global headquarters , more than 100 demonstrators chanted and waved signs saying stop supporting the dictator . \nAnd in London hundreds outside Egypt 's embassy . \nActually , there were two protests , Islamists on one demonstration , and around the corner , a secular protest . \nSESAY : Well , you 've seen the images , the protesters , their faces , but who are they ? \nWe 're taking a closer look . \nThey are the young . \nThe median age in Egypt is just 24 . \nMany are highly educated with advanced degrees . \nWell , despite that , though , they are unemployed or underemployed . \nAccording to the U.N. , Egypt 's per capita income is $ 1,800 a year . \nThe official unemployment rate last year was 7.9 percent . \nBut experts are saying the real jobless rate is significantly higher . \nAll of those factors created a volatile situation . \nMany different Egyptian students right here in the U.S. are keeping a very close eye on the protests , knowing that their friends are among those on the streets . \nSherif Morad is a PhD student at Georgia Tech and I 'm pleased to say he joins us now . \nThanks so much for joining us this evening . \nI want to start with a very basic question of how you are feeling seeing these scenes play out in Egypt , your home ? \nSHERIF MORAD , GEORGIA TECH GRADUATE STUDENT : Well , basically , of course , the situation today is very chaotic . \nOf course , as you know in the whole country . \nThe problem is the people who are let out of the prisons are doing a lot of looting , of course , across the nation . \nThe issue here , of course , we feel a lot of anger . \nWe feel there 's a lot of chaos going on . \nWe 're still proud , though , of the Egyptian people and what they have accomplished to get their freedom , trying to get real democracy . \nSESAY : You touched on this issue of the fear , the anxiety and the looting . \nHave you been able to make contact with family and friends ? \nWhat are they telling you about the situation ? \nMORAD : Yes , actually my parents , they live in the district in Cairo . \nStories from there are that people are trying to do a lot of vandalism and theft across the district and people who are trying to -- the neighbors and the whole -- in their district where the men were down the streets carrying basic , you know , stones or whatever they could get just to protect those homes from getting stolen . \nAfter that the army came and took over . \nSESAY : I spoke to someone early on today who said to me the issue with the young people in Egypt is that they have no dreams . \nNo dreams that can be achieved . \nExplain for our viewers here in the U.S. and around the world what the heart of the matter is here that is driving these people out on the streets , creating these scenes that we 're seeing . \nMORAD : Well , basically , of course , you hear about poverty , unemployment and other issues , but the real thing at stake here is basic human rights , freedom , democracy . \nThat 's the thing that is at stake . \nAnd the people when they want change right now , they need the change that is not only change of cabinet . \nIt 's not a change of another ministry . \nIt 's not getting your vice president . \nIt 's not getting a vice president from the same regime . \nSESAY : So , you do n't think this move of appointing Omar Suleiman is something significant ? \nMORAD : Not to the people . \nThey are not convinced that a vice president from the same regime can do any good . \nThe prime minister can not do any good . \nHe 's from the same regime . \nThey want a change of the whole regime , and they want to express their free will basically . \nSESAY : What is your sense about where the Mubarak regime stands now in light of these protests ? \nIs this the beginning of the end or is that really wishful thinking ? \nMORAD : Well , in a way , it is wishful thinking because now that he has -- that Mubarak has tightened the security , providing a government that is very security oriented , a vice president that is not so lovable in the country , being part of the regime . \nSo , personally , I think it 's the beginning of the end . \nSESAY : If you were in Egypt right now , would you be on the streets ? \nSESAY : You would be joining these people in these scenes ? \nAnd I want to mention here that a lot of people have been talking about who are these protesters , what category -- what social category are they coming from ? \nIs this Muslim Brotherhood ? \nIs this -- whatever movement ? \nNo , it 's just basically Egyptian people just wanting their free will , wanting democracy and getting out there to express it . \nSESAY : Is there a discussion among people like yourself who are here and hopefully being able to communicate with people back in Egypt as to what a post-Mubarak regime would look like ? \nBecause there are fears in the U.S. as to what could fill that vacuum . \nDo you share those fears ? \nMORAD : In a way , yes . \nBut , of course , change in itself is the goal right now . \nGetting a regime that really responds to people , getting a parliament that is really representative of the people . \nThat 's really missing right now . \nSo , we need fair elections . \nWe need basic human rights . \nWe need to get rid of the emergency law . \nWe need a lot of things that -- plus , we have sort of achieved and we are reaching out . \nThe Egyptian people are urging the international community to feel that this country is , as any other country , there 's a people that has to express its needs . \nOf course , looking at the future seems -- now it seems very chaotic , it seems very dark . \nBut there is light at the end of the tunnel . \nSESAY : Sharif Morad joining us here at CNN headquarters , we really appreciate your time and your insight . \nWolf , you hear Sharif saying that there is light at the end of the tunnel . \nThat is the hope of many people that they will see change there in Egypt , Wolf . \nBLITZER : He makes excellent points there . \nThank you very much , Isha . \nBy day , \\ tens of thousands are turning out to protest . \nBy night , they 're mourning the dead , treating their wounds and gathering strength . \nWhat started this whole uprising ? \nThat 's coming up next . \nSESAY : I want to welcome our viewers here in the United States and right around the world . \nEgyptian President Hosni Mubarak is facing the greatest threat ever to his 30-year regime and is struggling to maintain his hold on the government and regain control of the country . \nHere 's the status right now of this extremely fast-moving , highly volatile situation . \nTens of thousands of anti-government protesters again swarmed into the streets of Cairo and other cities demanding that Mubarak step down . \n`` Reuters '' news agency is reporting that police today shot and killed 17 protesters trying to attack two police stations south of Cairo . \nDozens of people were wounded . \nThe army , well , they have taken up positions in the streets acting on orders from Mubarak . \nBut so far , the military has n't cracked down on protesters . \nAlso , we should tell you that Nile Television is reporting that several people were killed today when some 1,000 inmates escaped from a prison southwest of Cairo . \nEyewitnesses of some Cairo neighborhoods report residents armed with sticks , kitchen knifes , other weapons they 've been able to get their hands on are trying to protect homes and businesses from looters . \nBLITZER : Thanks , Isha . \nTake a look at this raging protest filled the streets of Egypt 's second largest in Alexandria , demanding that the president , Hosni Mubarak , give up his 30-year reign of power . \nMany among the tens of thousands say they were inspired by demonstrators in Tunisia who forced their longtime president out of the country . \nBut is that the only driving force in Egypt ? \nLet 's assess what 's going on with Shibley Telhami . \nHe 's a senior fellow at the Saban Center for Mideast Policy , the Brookings Institute . \nHe 's the author of the important book , `` The Stakes : America in the Middle East , '' and he 's the Anwar Sadat professor at the University of Maryland . \nShibley , thanks very much for coming in . \nIf Mubarak goes and a lot of experts say eventually he will . \nIt could be days , weeks , months . \nSHIBLEY TELHAMI , SABEN CENTER FOR MIDEAST POLICY : Well , obviously , it will be uncertain . \nBut if you look in the past and we have never had an uprising of this scale in Egypt in any recorded history . \nI mean , if you look at 20th century , even the major anarchy in 1952 was relatively orderly led by the military . \nSo , this is really extraordinary . \nAnd we all should be very modest in what we can predict , and let 's face that . \nBLITZER : So , a lot of us were stunned to see the speed with which all of this has developed . \nTELHAMI : We were stunned and it 's a leaderless movement . \nWe are not talking about this being led by a political party or having even -- BLITZER : So , this motion that Mohamed ElBaradei , the former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency , is really one of the pillars of this . \nTELHAMI : He 's definitely not one of the pillars of this . \nHe has certain popularity , his credibility . \nHe 's been out there for a while . \nHe 's also not necessarily the type of person that most people want . \nBut this is not led by him or led by anyone else . \nAnd , by the way , a lot of the parties have made a decision not to really lead it , in part because they do n't want the backlash against them and they do n't want finger-pointing and let the public -- but it does n't mean that someone is n't going to exploit it at some point . \nSo , at some point when there 's a transition , it 's all going to depend to a large extent where the military will be . \nAnd let 's face it , right now , including with the appointments today of the Vice President Omar Suleiman , who is obviously out of the military and the president himself is out of the military , the prime minister is out of the military , the military institution is asserting itself . \nBLITZER : And that 's key right now . \nYou know , it 's fascinating , those of us who have studied Egypt over the years and I know you have a lot more than I , that when Nassir went down , the vice president , Anwar Sadat , took over . \nWhen Sadat was killed , the vice president , Hosni Mubarak , took over . \nMubarak , for 30 years , never wanted to have a vice president because he was afraid the vice president would take over . \nToday , he names Omar Suleiman vice president . \nWhat does that say to you ? \nTELHAMI : Number one , it really excludes his own , Gamal Mubarak already . \nBLITZER : So , he 's gone ? \nGamal Mubarak is not going to be the leader of Egypt ? \nTELHAMI : I mean , no one knows in the future . \nBut in any immediate scenario , he 's gone . \nBLITZER : Because that 's who Mubarak wanted . \nHe wanted Gamal to take over . \nTELHAMI : No question . \nNumber two , Mubarak is already preparing for his transition with Omar Suleiman . \nThis is someone he can trust . \nBLITZER : So , he wants Suleiman to take over ? \nTELHAMI : He -- this is someone he can trust and this is someone who 's got credibility . \nBLITZER : But I suspect a lot of those protesters despise Omar Suleiman as much as they might despise Hosni Mubarak . \nTELHAMI : Not as much . \nHe does have some following . \nBut this kind of appointment would have made a lot of sense a month ago and it might have been able to appease a lot of people . \nWith all that happened in the last week , it 's too little too late . \nSo , I do n't think it 's going to appease people but it does tell me one thing , though , that is the military is asserting itself . \nAnd , clearly , how they behave on the streets is going to matter a lot . \nAnd , by the way , the military is n't just going to be interested in the particular person who 's going to lead Egypt . \nThey have to protect their reputation . \nThey have been the anchor of political institution in Egypt really since 1952 overthrow of the monarchy , and they do n't want to sully their name with the public which still sees them as an anchor of the government themselves , and they need them for , you know , order no matter how the transition takes place . \nThey do n't want to put themselves against the people and that 's going to be the dilemma . \nCan they maintain the order without , you know , antagonizing the public that they need because they have to look post - Mubarak era to make sure that they 're going to play an essential role in the future and that 's going to be really critical . \nBLITZER : I was fascinated by some of the reaction unfolding throughout the Middle East . \nThe Saudis , for example , they issued a statement in the name of the king , infiltrators , Saudi Arabia calling the protests of the work of infiltrators pledging solidarity with Egypt right now . \nIran , on the other hand , their foreign ministry issuing a diametrically opposed statement , saying Iran expects Egyptian officials to listen to the voice of their Muslim people , respond to their rightful demands and refrain from exerting violence by security forces and police against an Islamic wave of awareness that has spread through the country in the form of a popular movement . \nAssess what we 're just hearing . \nThe Saudis support Mubarak . \nThe Iranians support the demonstrators . \nTELHAMI : Well , look , there 's going to be a war of narrative . \nLet 's face it . \nIt 's going to be -- it 's already begun . \nI see it today , who 's behind this finger-pointing . \nThere 's even stories in some of the Arab press maybe even the U.S. was behind the uprising in Egypt . \nBLITZER : Because there 's always conspiratorial theories . \nTELHAMI : There 's always conspiratorial . \nSo there 's going to be two things that are going to be contested . \nNumber one is who 's behind it . \nThere 's already reinventing what happened in Tunisia saying it was a failed coup by the security services only to be preempted by the military . \nThis really was n't about the popular old revolution . \nYou 're going to have reinvention in Saudi because the stakes are so high for everyone involved . \nAnd you 're going to have also a war of narratives about what the consequence will be . \nYou can see people scaring people saying there 's going to be anarchy . \nThere 's going to be looting . \nThere 's going to be prisoners escaping . \nBLITZER : We 're seeing a lot of that . \nWe 're seeing a lot of that . \nAnd the conspirators -- the conspiratorial theories say the government is behind this . \nThey want to see this chaos develop so that the people will come back to the regime and say , please , quiet things down . \nTELHAMI : And , in part , because they 've been used to governments scaring them by saying there 's -- BLITZER : Is there an element of truth to that ? \nTELHAMI : You never know and that 's why the public ca n't be sure . \nBut they know when they saw the anarchy in Iraq after the overthrow of the dictator Saddam Hussein , they did n't like it at all and the governments were able to say , do you want Cairo or do you want Baghdad ? \nAnd they wanted Cairo at that time . \nAnd they wanted Ahman -LRB- ph -RRB- at that time . \nSo I think that kind of scaring tactic worked in the past . \nThey think it will work in the current situation . \nI do n't think so . \nIt 's too late for it . \nBLITZER : Shibley 's going to stay with us . \nDo n't go too far away , Shibley Telhami . \nThanks very , very much . \nIsha , there 's a lot of questions that have to be answered . \nWe 're going to try to do the best we can but , no doubt , many of these questions will remain unanswered . \nIt will depend on what happens on the street . \nAnd one of the big questions is , of course , Egypt 's army . \nIt is a major factor in events unfolding rapidly in Cairo and the rest of the country . \nAs we 've told you , the army is in the streets of Cairo but so far has n't turned against the protesters . \nThe police , well , they seemed to have vanished . \nIvan Watson joins us live to bring us up to speed of what he 's been seeing and hearing in Cairo at this point in time -- Ivan . \nIVAN WATSON : Well , Isha , it 's 3:30 in the morning right now and the streets are quite quiet . \nWe have tanks -- army tanks parked at intersection and , in fact , right behind the balcony where I 'm standing right now . \nBut for the most part the streets have been quiet for the last few hours . \nI 'm going to show you a report that gives you a sense of some of the scenes we saw -- dramatic scenes in the streets of the Egyptian capital during the afternoon just a few hours ago . \nTake a look at this . \nWATSON : Crowds have gathered here . \nThey 're still chanting . \nThere 's still a lot of elation . \nBut the curfew is coming fast . \nAlso , we 're trying to ask people , what are they going to do when they 're told to go indoors ? \nMadam , are you going to go inside when the curfew starts ? \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : No , I will not go inside . \n-LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- on my dead body . \nThey will kill me no problem . \nWATSON : You 're going to stay out protesting ? \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : All of us , we will stay here . \nWATSON : It 's hard to put into words the scenes of elation that we 're seeing here with people hanging on the military 's tanks riding through town . \nOne man said , as a result of today I feel proud to be an Egyptian for the very first time , chanting , down with the regime . \nBut there has been violence amid this carnival atmosphere . \nWe 've seen a number of people wounded , being treated by doctors on the dirty floor outside a mosque . \nWATSON : People are very excited right now and pretty upset because there has been some shooting going on . \nThe doctor telling us five dead people have been brought into the entrance of this mosque and there 's one being treated right now with a bullet wound . \nThis has been a day of liberation for some but it 's also been a day of violence and the doctors here at this rescue center say they 've been treating people coming in with wounds throughout the afternoon . \nWe 've heard about a number of gunshots . \nYou can see this young man being treated right here with some kind of wounds to his chest and arm . \nThe name of this square where this sea of chanting humanity has come to is called Tahrir Square . \nAnd the people here are celebrating a kind of freedom that many of them say they 've never felt before . \nIsha , many of the Egyptians I 've spoken with today they said that they no longer feel fear for their government or the security forces which is part of why we see these scenes of amazing defiance . \nAnother point I wanted to bring out , many of them also said that much of the momentum behind this movement and these protests really came from the example of Tunisia just a few weeks ago this very month when Tunisians rose up -- another Arab country , another north African country , rose up and overthrew a dictator that had ruled them for more than two decades -- Isha . \nSESAY : Ivan Watson , bringing us up to speed with what 's happening in Cairo , Egypt . \nIvan , we appreciate it . \nBLITZER : All right , Isha . \nWe 're going to stay in touch with all our correspondents on the scene . \nAlso , circus performers , musicians , magicians , tourists . \nTonight , they 're all stuck at the huge international airport in Cairo . \nWe 're going there live right after this quick break . \nSESAY : Welcome back , everyone . \nThe Cairo airport is a sea of humanity and confusion as people struggle to get out of the country . \nCNN 's Arwa Damon is there . \nArwa , describe what 's happening right now . \nARWA DAMON , CNN BEIRUT CORRESPONDENT : Well , Isha , both at the arrival and departure lounges you have people who have basically been bracing themselves for the night ahead . \nTrying to sleep on the floor . \nA few with sleeping bags curling up inside . \nVery difficult situation especially because things like food and water at the airport itself are really running down to very , very low stocks if any at all . \nWe were struggling to find some ourselves . \nWe spoke with a number of people who are stuck there , an elderly couple from the United States who were saying they had been on a weeklong vacation in Egypt . \nClearly had a lovely time . \nThey were then at the airport trying to catch a connecting flight to their next destination only to be stuck there for two days in a row . \nBearing in mind , though , that the majority of these passengers stuck at the airport not necessarily because of a delay in flights , although that is taking place , but also because of the fact that there is this curfew going on . \nWe saw large tour operators , groups that were there , many of them saying that their tour guides were telling them that it just simply was not safe to leave the airport and go outside . \nWe also spoke with a group of British artists . \nThey had come over to be part of a high-profile VIP celebrity . \nThey were coming over with a party organizer . \nThey were a group of musicians , artists . \nThey was a magician amongst them . \nThey were saying that the magician was putting on tricks at the airport trying to entertain others . \nBut they also not knowing what they were doing , where they were going next . \nA lot of confusion , Isha , at this stage . \nSESAY : Arwa , we 've been telling our viewers about the state of anxiety there in Cairo , in many neighborhoods . \nTell me , is there a feeling of safety at least at the airport ? \nDAMON : There is to a certain degree . \nYou know , the conflict and the violence itself has not yet reached the airport . \nBut there is fear of really just stepping outside beyond the doors of the airport . \nTransportation , for example , very tricky especially because of the curfew that is taking place overnight . \nTo give you an idea , we were trying to leave the airport . \nWe managed to find a young man who was willing to drive us to a nearby hotel . \nHe was so frightened and so anxious , he took a wrong turn . \nWe ended up at an army checkpoint where the troops that were there made us get out of the vehicle . \nThey went through our belongings , our IDs . \nThey 're also very tense . \nWe just received reports that they had -- that other forces had managed to detain two Egyptian individuals who had a vehicle filled with weapons appearing to be preparing some sort of ambush . \nWhen we finally arrived at the hotel , a fairly steady stream of people who had somehow managed to make it outside of the airport at least to find a more comfortable place to sleep . \nBut it really gives you an idea of just how tense this city is . \nPeople do n't know what is going to be happening in the morning . \nThey do n't know what is going to be happening next -- Isha . \nSESAY : Arwa Damon , joining us there from Cairo 's airport . \nAnd , Wolf , Arwa very clearly breaking it down for us there at the airport . \nThere 's a lot of tension and food and water stocks running down and people just do n't know what 's going to happen next . \nBLITZER : Yes , I know . \nSo many tourists including a lot of American tourists , European tourists , they are anxious to get out of Egypt for understandable reasons . \nRight now , it 's not that easy . \nA lot of them are stuck at the airport . \nWe 're going to have more on this part of the story , Isha . \nBut let 's turn to our national security analyst Peter Bergen once again . \nPeter , it started in Tunisia , I think it 's fair to say . \nWhat happened there created this spark and it 's spreading . \nIt 's spreading not only to Egypt but to Yemen , maybe even to other countries like Jordan . \nIs that what 's going on ? \nPETER BERGEN , CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST : Yes , that is what 's going on . \nIt will be interesting to see which countries are not affected . \nI mean , I think the Saudi regime is obviously -- they have a very effective police state . \nThey do deliver something to their people , the cost of , you know , an autocratic regime . \nBLITZER : And they issued a strong statement today condemning the uprising in Egypt . \nAnd the Saudi royal family has been on the throne at one time or another since the 18th century . \nThey 're also -- they 're officially the defenders of the faith of Islam , a title they awarded themselves in 1986 , the defenders of the two holy places . \nSo , you know , I think where we 're least likely to see this is in Saudi Arabia and , of course , there 's not much freedom of the press . \nBERGEN : Well , Jordan we 're already beginning to see some of that . \nBut again , you know , the Hashemite monarchy has also been around for some period of time . \nThis is not something that just sprang up , you know , 20 , 30 years ago as a result of a military coup . \nThis is something that has been around for most of the 20th century . \nSo , again , King Abdullah may not have quite the stature of his father and he is not necessarily particularly popular , but I think there 's more legitimacy in these long-term monarchies than , let 's say , somebody like Mubarak who , after all , came to power essentially because he just -- he was the guy who was n't shot on the reviewing stand in 1981 . \nBLITZER : Two countries where the U.S would like to see a Democratic uprising develop would be Iran and Syria . \nHow likely is that -- how likely is this to spread to those two countries ? \nBERGEN : Well , I 'm not holding my breath on Syria for obvious reasons . \nA very effective police state . \nIn Iran we did see , you know , something -- BLITZER : Fifteen months ago it looked like things were happening . \nYou know , the difference between Iran and Egypt , Iran is not one man . \nYou know , Ahmadinejad is also part of a larger system . \nSo , you know , dictatorships are , you know -- when the dictator is unpopular , he is the only person who can be blamed because he has not apportioned power to anybody else . \nYou know , Iran has a larger system and does have , you know , some form of Democratic elections . \nObviously , they 're not perfect but , you know , there is more legitimacy strangely for the Iranian regime than there is for the Egyptian regime . \nWe 're seeing that very clearly , I think , here . \nBLITZER : Peter , thanks very much . \nIsha , there 's a lot of dominos potentially out there that could yet fall . \nWe 're watching it every step of the way . \nSESAY : We certainly are . \nWe 're watching the entire region . \nWell , dancing with leaders who rule with iron fists . \nFor years , the U.S. has supported Egypt 's Hosni Mubarak . \nHas President Obama now decided to cut ties with him ? \nSome answers coming up next . \nBARACK OBAMA , PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES : The people of Egypt have rights that are universal . \nThat includes the right to peaceful assembly and association . \nThe right to free speech and the ability to determine their own destiny . \nThese are human rights and the United States will stand up for them everywhere . \nBLITZER : The crisis in Egypt is triggering protests around the globe . \nStarting in the upper left and moving like the hands of a clock you see people supporting the pro-democracy effort from Istanbul , Turkey , to Geneva , Switzerland , to New York and London . \nIn New York , protesters outside the United Nations Building carried signs saying , the Mubarak regime must go . \nThe U.S. government has a long history of supporting directly or indirectly iron fisted rulers or outright dictators . \nBut now President Obama finds himself facing a very , very tough dilemma , offering moral support to the protesters in Egypt while struggling what to do about Hosni Mubarak , the president . \nJoining us now with their thoughts , two guests , Fran Townsend , a CNN national security contributor , and Mona Eltahawy , an Egyptian-born commentator and journalist . \nThanks to both of you for coming in . \nThere are no easy answers , Mona , for President Obama right now . \nWhat do you do ? \nWhat should the U.S. be doing right now ? \nMONA ELTAHAWY , COLUMNIST , ASHARQ AL-AWSAT : Well , I would remind President Obama of his inauguration speech in which he promised that he would stand with those who unclenched their fists -- tyrants who unclenched their fists . \nAnd he told those tyrants that they were on the wrong side of history . \nSo my message to President Obama tonight is choose the right side of history because the right side of history is Egypt 's future , who are the young people who have filled the streets of my country and made me very proud to be an Egyptian . \nThis is the most exciting time of my life . \nChoose the future of Egypt and choose the people of Egypt over the dictator of Egypt . \nThat 's my message . \nBLITZER : So if you were in Cairo right now , Mona , you would be marching with those demonstrators . \nELTAHAWY : Oh , you bet I would . \nI was in Cairo in 2005 and it was a huge -- it was one of the proudest moments of my life when I was marching in some of those street protests , those very courageous young people organized . \nAnd it 's the same courageous young people who took me to those marches in 2005 who have been confronting Mubarak 's brutal security forces every day . \nI salute them and I bow down to their courage and I urge the international community to side with the future of Egypt and choose freedom and dignity for the Egyptian people as we are choosing today . \nBLITZER : I 've studied the pictures of the demonstrators , Mona . \nI see women , although obviously not as many women there as men . \nWhat 's your assessment ? \nAre women as involved in these demonstrations as the men are ? \nELTAHAWY : They absolutely are . \nSomebody asked me on Twitter because I spend my entire life on Twitter these days . \nSomeone asked me , where are the women in the uprising of Egypt ? \nAnd so I sent out a question . \nI have something like 10,000 people who follow me . \nSo I thought someone has to tell me . \nI 'm not there . \nAnd I got lots of pictures . \nThere are pages that have been set up on Facebook called the Women of Egypt . \nWomen who look like me . \nWomen wearing head scarves . \nWomen who cover their face . \nWomen of every background . \nBecause we in Egypt -- I say , we , because I 'm Egyptian but it 's their courage . \nThey in Egypt today and every day for the past five days have been fighting to take back our country and this involves women and men . \nI 'm very proud of what they 're doing in Egypt . \nBLITZER : Mona , hold on for a minute . \nFran Townsend , our homeland security contributor is here . \nYou used to be the homeland security adviser to President Bush and you worked with Omar Suleiman , who 's the new vice president of Egypt . \nTell us about this man . \nFRAN TOWNSEND , HOMELAND SECURITY CONTRIBUTOR : That 's right . \nI mean , this is a guy who has an illustrious military career which is how he came to Mubarak 's attention , of course . \nHe then becomes the chief military -- chief intelligence officer . \nThis is at the absolute top of the security apparatus throughout Egypt . \nAnd so when he becomes the vice president today , what message does that send to the world and to the people of Egypt ? \nBLITZER : What is the message ? \nTOWNSEND : Well , I think this is more of the same . \nThis is part of that tight circle around Mubarak that he 's only promoting those who he trusts and that are already around him . \nI will tell you , this is really disheartening and President Obama called for a number of things including not seeing violence against protesters . \nToday we see more than 17 dead . \nHe 's talked -- the president called on Hosni Mubarak to open up the Internet and the social networking sites . \nNone of that 's happened . \nAnd the pressure is going to continue to increase on Mubarak and on President Obama to make a clearer statement . \nBLITZER : So what I hear you saying is when President Mubarak reshuffles his government , his cabinet and names Omar Suleiman to be the vice president , the first time he 's ever had a vice president , former head of the intelligence organizations in Egypt , name is Ahmad Shafiq , the prime minister , a retired air force general . \nWhat you 're saying is , this is n't change you can believe in . \nTOWNSEND : No , this is -- not only is this not change you can believe in , but this is the kind of change , the sort of moves that will absolutely infuriate and further inspire the protesters . \nBLITZER : Let me ask Mona to weigh in . \nDo you agree with Fran on that , Mona ? \nWhen Hosni Mubarak addressed the nation yesterday and said , I 'm going to fire my government . \nHe got it all wrong . \nHe got it back to front . \nThey want him to fire himself . \nThe protesters in Tahrir Square , Liberation Square in downtown Cairo , are chanting now against Mubarak and Omar Suleiman . \nYou know , Egypt is the number one destination for -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- . \nOmar Suleiman has been responsible for torturing terrorism suspects for the U.S. administration . \nEverybody in Egypt knows this and they associate Omar Suleiman and Hosni Mubarak with torture and with filling up Egyptian jails and human rights violations . \nEgyptians want the entire Mubarak regime gone in the way that Tunisians want the entire -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- regime gone and they 're doing it . \nAnd we are learning from the Tunisians . \nAnd I 'm optimistic that they 'll do it in Egypt . \nBLITZER : During the Bush administration , were there renditions to Egypt and to Omar Suleiman who is in charge of the intelligence community ? \nIs she right , in other words ? \nTOWNSEND : Well , the one that 's best known is the one where the individual was taken to Canada . \nCanada then returned him and there was much litigation about it and there was litigation about his treatment . \nBLITZER : That was in Syria , was n't it ? \nTOWNSEND : You know , you 're right , Wolf . \nThat one was to Syria . \nLook , there 's a long history of renditions , you are quite correct , between the United States and Egypt . \nAnd , look , we -- because of the State Department Human Rights Report , there were procedures put in place to try to protect anyone who has returned from Egypt from suffering from the kinds of human rights abuses . \nBLITZER : Mona , one final question before I let you go , how much time do you think there is for President Mubarak right now before he steps down ? \nELTAHAWY : Hosni Mubarak is finished and he is going to step down in a matter of days . \nAnd just to put that into perspective for you . \nIt took the Tunisians 29 days to overthrow the 23-year dictatorship of Ben Ali . \nEgyptians took to the streets five days ago and in four days Hosni Mubarak called in the army . \nIn four days , a regime , a tyrant of 30 years has crumbled before tens of thousands of his people in just four days . \nHosni Mubarak is finished and I am confident that the people of Egypt will find an interim government and will move on . \nAnd I 'm confident that this uprising will turn into a revolution that will inspire the entire Arab world . \nBLIZTER : Mona and Fran , both of you stand by . \nYou 're going to be joining us in the next hour as well . \nIsha , you can see there 's a lot of passion when it comes to this subject . \nSESAY : Yes , there certainly is . \nAnd , Wolf , these protests are obviously taking a significant toll on the people of Egypt . \nThey 're also taking an emotional toll on one of our reporter 's family . \nThat story 's coming up next . \n"}

\nPLEITGEN : That 's also one of those situations . \nIt 's very , very difficult to get any verifiable information on that situation . \nWhat we 're hearing from people there who are close to that area is that there is a large protest at the interior ministry , that there is apparently violence at the interior ministry . \nIt appears as though , there 's interior ministry possibly police personnel inside that building , guarding the building and sort of shielding the building trying to get people to -- or trying to stop people from getting in that building . \nI 'm hearing from people that there are snipers on the roof of that building who are shooting at people . \nThis is stuff that we have n't been able to verify independently . \nBut it certainly is from people who we trust very much who are giving us this information . \nSo certainly the interior ministry seems to be one of those flashpoints . \nAnd I can tell you that the interior minister of this country or now the former interior minister was -- of course one of the most despised people here in the country simply because the police force here -- here in Egypt is -- is so very hated by so many people because so many people had witnessed and have been subject to police brutality that this ministry is certainly one of the flashpoints here in the city and -- and indeed here in this country . \nMANN : Now Fredrick , obviously , this is far from over , but already there has been an enormous human cost . \nWe 've seen reports of hundreds of people in hospital , dozens dead . \nWhat can you tell us about those who have been hurt , those who have been killed and those who have been taken under arrest ? \nPLEITGEN : Well , we do know that there 's some sort of makeshift center being set up in some places to treat people who have been injured and people are trying to get treatment . \nOther people are telling us that after they were arrested by police , that they were beaten by police officers , something people held for two days or so . \nSo certainly , you 're absolutely right , there has been a very high toll not just of course in deaths but also in people who are injured and wounded in the fighting in recent days . \n-LRB- AUDIO GAP -RRB- that there were a lot of people who seem to be wounded . \nSome of them lightly , some of them more heavily in part by tear gas and in part because they were hit by tear gas canisters , in part because they got shot -- they got hit in the head . \nSo certainly this is something where a lot of people have gotten hurt so far . \nSo you 're absolutely right . \nThis has already taken a very , very large toll -LRB- ph -RRB- not just here to Cairo but of course , also in other places across the country -- Jonathan . \nMANN : Frederik Pleitgen reporting to us live . \nAnd we want to bring you the latest developments now . \nAmid Shafiq we know has been appointed to form the new Egyptian government . \nEgyptian state TV , NOW TV said Shafiq has been serving as civil aviation minister . \nAnd so after the president dramatically fired his government and appointed a new vice president for the first time in his regime choosing what sounds like a technocrat to form the next government . \nCivil aviation is not traditionally one of the key posts where you 've made a lot of powerful enemies in a government like that . \nKAYE : So what do you make of this , when you have now -- he 's -- he 's now appointed a -- a prime minister and a vice president . \nShould we read into this ? \nMANN : It sounds like he 's not going away any time soon . \nIt 's hard to tell . \nAll of this is mystifying people around the world . \nAnd I -- I 'm -- I 'm no visionary , but the extraordinary thing is Hosni Mubarak had a chance to leave easily and quickly . \nHe 's clearly not doing that . \nHe seems to be doing what he told his people he would , assembling a government and remember in that -- in that speech he gave to the -- to the Egyptian people , he said , `` That he was responsible for the stability of his country '' . \nWhat we now know is that the vice president , the first vice president in 30 years of the Mubarak regime is a figure who has been responsible for suppressing this dissent and suppressing violence and suppressing opposition . \nKAYE : And part of Mubarak 's inner circle . \nThe man who trust very few has now brought even closer . \nKAYE : Well , we will continue to follow this . \nWe 'll take a quick break . \nKAYE : Welcome back , 12 minutes past the hour . \nMore rage in the streets of Egypt . \nAnti-government protesters are there . \nYou 're looking at some video of some of the protesters who are still out in the streets in full force today . \nAnti-government demonstrations are in their fifth day . \nThis hour , protesters are defying a curfew . \nThe state-run Nile TV reports at least 38 deaths in those protests . \nA doctor in Cairo is reporting that at least five people have died from gunshot wounds near the Egyptian interior ministry . \nWe 've spoken with several eyewitnesses in that area , one who had seen two people actually shot by police there . \nOne grazed in the head and a very graphic description of a man spitting out blood . \nEarlier state TV reported President Hosni Mubarak 's cabinet resigned . \nThat move hours after the Egyptian leader promised reforms in an address to the nation . \nReports from Saudi Arabia say that King Abdullah called Mr. Mubarak to say he stands with the embattled Egyptian president . \nWe should also mention that -- that Hosni Mubarak has also appointed a vice president , Omar Suleiman , who has been described to us as a -- as a bit of a thug but well-respected in that region . \nA fixer , if you will , one of the world 's most powerful spy chiefs . \nAnd he has also appointed a new prime minister . \nSo two new cabinet members . \nThe prime minister being -- who is once served as civil aviation minister according to Egyptian state TV and Nile TV . \nMANN : Intriguing appointments . \nHe 's appointed his spy chief to help him and he 's also taken someone from the ranks of the air force because Ahmed Shafiq spent decades as a courier air force man . \nThat is of course , Hosni Mubarak 's own background . \nSo he 's not reaching out to new people , as best we can tell . \nBut Jonathan Alterman has followed all of this . \nAnd the events in Egypt closely , he joins us now to talk about what 's ahead . \nWhat do you make of these appointments ? \nJON ALTERMAN , CENTER FOR STRATEGIC AND INTERNATIONAL STUDIES : Well , you know , Omar Suleiman , in many ways is Hosni Mubarak 's comfort zone . \nThe way he got close to Hosni Mubarak is in the 1995 assassination attempt in Addis Ababa . \nHe protected the president . \nHe 's been close to the president since 1995 . \nHe 's the guy who makes everything that the president needs to have work , work . \nSo he 's very important with security relationship with the United States . \nHe 's very important in Egypt 's relations with Hamas and with Israel . \nHe runs a lot of the domestic intelligence and security services . \nHe 's the person Hosni Mubarak is most comfortable with . \nHe has no question -- Hosni Mubarak has no question Omar Suleiman is not going to try to push him out . \nHe 's going to defend Hosni Mubarak . \nMANN : And he already has because we can describe him as a trusted confidante , as a problem-solver , as a fixer . \nThis is not a man with a gentle past . \nThis is a man who put down the Islamists who are threatening this regime and that was a fairly bloody bit of work . \nALTERMAN : Not only that but he 's also a person , he does n't like the spotlight . \nHe does n't want to be in the press . \nIt 's actually hard to find a picture of Omar Suleiman . \nI met him once in a sort of strange situation . \nBut he is not somebody who wants to be the president of Egypt . \nHe 's somebody who wants to protect the president of Egypt . \nHe wants to protect the military government in Egypt . \nAnd that 's the kind of person Hosni Mubarak wants at his side at this time of tremendous uncertainty . \nKAYE : As we watch the uncertainty continue and the protests continue on the streets , Jonathan , what will these new appointments mean to ordinary Egyptians who are there fighting for their rights , fighting for jobs , fighting for economic security ? \nALTERMAN : Yes , I think what this suggests is the president is trying to signal resolve . \nThat he 's not going to make what he sees as the mistake that Ben Ali made in Tunisia that you try to concede and actually a day after Ben Ali tried to give conciliatory speech he was on a plane out of the country . \nI do think though that this has to be understood as the beginning of the final act of Hosni Mubarak 's presidency . \nThere are presidential elections slated for next fall . \nI can not imagine that Hosni Mubarak will run in those elections . \nI think what we 're looking at is some transition . \nAnd the issue here is really is Egypt 's political future going to be a continuation of the military establishment essentially running the country in a civilian guise or is that all in doubt and then nobody has any idea what would be there ? \nAnd as I read the quotations in all the newspaper articles that I read in the last several days , I do n't really sense that Egyptians are clamoring for democracy in elections . \nI sense what they 're clamoring for is better results . \nThe bet that Hosni Mubarak is making , that Omar Suleiman are going to be making is that if the military closes ranks and supports the president and talks about working that transition , that they can have a guided transition away from Hosni Mubarak instead of a chaotic one . \nKAYE : And of course , a lot of people are still wondering how all of this , as it unfolds , whether it gets better or worse , is going to affect the global markets . \nWhat 's your take on that ? \nALTERMAN : Well , it 's very early to tell partly because I think the most important decisions are going to be the decisions made over the next nine to 12 months about what is the future government of Egypt going to look like , who is going to be in and who is going to be out and how is Egypt going to relate to others in the region ? \nIs it still going to be as strong an ally as it has been to the United States for the last 30 years . \nI sense there 's going to be some jitteriness now and certainly if Hosni Mubarak goes down in flames -- and I think that 's probably not especially likely , but it 's possible , then that would create a huge sense of uncertainty throughout the Middle East . \nIt would also create uncertainty in Israel . \nAnd then Israel would be much more likely to take unpredictable unilateral action which would create greater instability in the Middle East . \nKAYE : All right . \nJonathan Alterman for us . \nThank you so much for your insight . \nMANN : Hosni Mubarak says he 's staying , and now he has help . \nTwo new figures emerge from the chaos in Cairo . \nWe 'll be back with more right after this . \nMANN : Well , tens of thousands of Egyptians want Hosni Mubarak to leave the presidency , but at least two men have signed on to help him stay . \nKAYE : They want to be a part of it . \nMANN : We have word that Ahmed Shafiq has been appointed as the new prime minister of Egypt and Omar Suleiman has been appointed vice president for the first time in three decades of Mubarak 's rule . \nKAYE : Two men with some interesting history there as well . \nMANN : Interesting history and contacts around the world which brings us now to Elise Labott in Washington for more on State Department reaction . \nSuleiman , in particular is well-known to diplomats around the world , well-known to America . \nELISE LABOTT , CNN SENIOR U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT PRODUCER : That 's right , Jon ; really well-known to the U.S. ; really one of the main interlocutors between the U.S. State Department , intelligence agencies and the White House . \nWe just spoke to State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley who told CNN that he 's someone we know well and have worked closely with . \nOur focus is putting concrete reactions behind Mubarak . \nWords , we believe Egypt needs a meaningful process that leads to genuine reform . \nAnd I spoke to another official just a short time ago that said , we like him very much , but it 's not about personalities . \nIt 's about policies . \nThe U.S. really wants to see over the next couple of days , they 're not expecting instantaneous results , but they want to see President Mubarak really reach out and make a meaningful set of reforms that he can demonstrate to his people that he hears them , what 's going on in the streets . \nMANN : Elise , can I ask you a basic undiplomatic question ? \nDoes the Obama administration want to see Hosni Mubarak hang on ? \nDo they want to see him remain as president of Egypt ? \nLABOTT : Well , I keep hearing this phrase , managed change . \nAnd I think Jon Alterman had it about right . \nThey want to see a process -- political process where people are brought in , a national dialogue , if you will , going beyond the elites , talking about job creation , talking about how to alleviate some of the social and economic frustrations in the country . \nI think they 'd like to see him go , but at some point , because obviously they 've been working closely with him , but he 's frustrated them on a lot of issues including human rights , but they do n't know who is going to come next . \nAnd so they want to see a process where maybe lift a state of emergency , there are elections in September . \nIf you can see a process where a genuine opposition with a face , with a name , specific candidates maybe could run in the September election . \nI think they 'd like to see Mubarak gradually phase out . \nBut right now they do n't know who comes next , that 's a very scary proposition for the United States . \nSo I keep hearing that phrase , managed change . \nNot right now , I do n't think they want to see him go , but ultimately they would like to see a more democratic face in Egypt . \nMANN : Elise Labott in Washington . \nThanks you very much . \nKAYE : This uprising in Egypt is not a surprise to our next guest . \nAladdin Elaasar is the author of `` The Last Pharaoh : Mubarak and the uncertain future of Egypt in the Obama age . '' \nAladdin also ran against President Mubarak in the 2005 election . \nMANN : He joins us now live from Chicago . \nAladdin , you not only predicted a revolt against Mubarak but you also believe his regime will fall . \nIs this what 's going to do it ? \nAre we watching this happen now ? \nALADDIN ELAASAR , AUTHOR , `` THE LAST PHARAOH '' : Well , I was not surprised to see that all happen and unfold . \nI was not surprised either to see Omar Suleiman to be appointed as the vice president because I talked about that in my book and I have predicted that . \nI predicted several scenarios that could unfold . \nThis is all too similar . \nAnd the thing that is not about Omar Suleiman as a fixer , as a consigliore -LRB- ph -RRB- , but it 's about what the Egyptian people want . \nThe people on the street , they simply want Mr. Mubarak out , his regime , his party , people , his family , all of these symbols . \nMANN : Let me jump in . \nIs that what they 're going to get ? \nMANN : Is that what they 're going to get ? \nAll hope aside , let me ask you this . \nJust look at what 's going to unfold in the next several days and tell us what you expect . \nELAASAR : Well , I do not think that these demonstrations will go away very soon because they have very specific demands . \nAnd these are very young people , about 60 percent of the Egyptian population who are educated , a lot of them unemployed . \nThey can not get married , there 's a housing crisis . \nThey live with their families . \nSo they have a lot of anger and frustration and hopelessness . \nSo they have specific demands . \nAnd they said it loud and clear that they want President Mubarak out . \nI would not be surprised either to see that all of that will not happen and will not succeed to appease the Egyptian people and Mr. Mubarak would be stepping down because already some members of his family headed for London since the last few days , even some of the heads of the regime . \nThey know that their days are numbered . \nWe 're seeing the same that 's been happening in Tunisia . \nAnd we are failing again , once again , to read the writing on the wall . \nWe failed to learn the lessons of Iran 30 years ago or Marcos in the Philippines , Suharto in Indonesia that military dictators -- dictators will inevitably fall . \nAnd we have to talk to the people . \nWe have n't been talking to the Egyptian people . \nThey need to see strong messages from us . \nMANN : We 're doing our best to talk to them now . \nAnd they 're certainly being heard . \nThank you very much . \nAnd just a quick point to make , Randi , before we go . \nHe talked about a report that we 've been seeing that some of the figures close to Mubarak personally , some members of his family -- we 've been seeing all kinds of rumors -- have started turning up in other places . \nMANN : We 're trying very hard to find out if that 's true . \nWe do not know that that 's the case . \nYou may be seeing these kinds of rumors on the Internet . \nPeople being spotted in airports and other countries ; we 're trying very hard because those would be important signals if they were accurate . \nWe simply do not know . \nKAYE : We also do n't know where Hosni Mubarak is , not only his family but also where he is . \nWe 'll continue to stay on top of that and everything else . \nWe are watching our correspondents . \nWe have cameras all over the region and we 'll be right back . \nMANN : Welcome back . \nLet 's update you now on the latest out of Egypt , a country very much in crisis as protests continue there for a fifth consecutive day . \nThere is also a major government change to tell you about . \nEgyptian state television reporting that Omar Suleiman , the head of Egypt 's Intelligence Service , has been appointed vice president , and a minister from the recently dismissed cabinet , Ahmed Shafiq , has been appointed to form a new government as prime minister . \nThat word coming as well from state TV . \nKAYE : And we have correspondents , as we 've mentioned , all over the region , all over Egypt . \nNic Robertson is in Alexandria , Egypt , for us . \nNic , we 've heard so many reports of violence this morning , and shooting as well . \nWhat is the situation in Alexandria ? \nNIC ROBERTSON , CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : It 's still a fluid situation . \nIt 's been a relatively peaceful situation through the day . \nThere are army on the streets . \nThousands of people have been protesting . \nBehind me , you 're looking along the Cornish area , the road that runs along by the side of the Mediterranean . \nJust a few minutes ago , a couple of army personnel carriers , armored personnel carriers , raced along there , heading away somewhere else . \nWe could n't tell where . \nThey 've been posted around the city , keeping security on some of the government institution buildings here in the city . \nFifteen minutes ago we heard gunshots being fired off in this direction over here . \nWe have n't heard any more gunshots since then . \nToday , however , the tone has been a very solid tone of get rid of President Mubarak . \nBut the tone has also been a relatively peaceful one . \nBut the crowds are still out . \nAnd about a half an hour ago , I just looked over the balcony here and there was some shouting going on . \nAnd I could see the crowds dragging away a man from the street . \nAnd they had their arm around his neck , in a neck lock . \nIt was n't clear where this mob was taking him away to but , clearly , whatever he 'd been doing , they were certainly very angry with -- Randi . \nKAYE : And from what you 've seen in terms of the anger on the street , as we get word of a new prime minister and a new vice president , how do you think that will be received among the protesters on the street ? \nWill that be enough ? \nROBERTSON : Among the protesters we 've been talking to , the vast majority are going to reject these picks , because they see them as part of the system , as part of the apparatus of President Mubarak 's regime . \nAnd for that reason , they will probably say that they do n't want them , they reject this idea , they want a fresh start . \nHowever , there are quieter voices on the sides -- on the margins of the demonstrations here . \nAnd they 've been saying , look , President Mubarak said out with the old government , I 'll bring in a new one . \nAnd people were saying , look , we 're very worried about what 's going to happen . \nWe do n't want a return to violence here , we 're worried about where all these street protests will lead us to , perhaps it 's better to let this new government be formed and see how that is . \nBut the people saying that , I do have to say , seem to be in the minority . \nThe majority are looking for a clean sweep of the leadership -- on the streets here , if you will . \nThese politicians have been part of President Mubarak 's regime . \nWho is going to explain to these angry people that these new leaders who are part of the old system are going to be better for them ? \nAnd it 's not clear at the moment how that 's going to happen . \nSo I think we can expect to hear challenges even to these early picks . \nKAYE : All right . \nNic Robertson for us in Alexandria , one of the many correspondents that we have in that area covering this crisis for us as it unfolds . \nWe 'd like to take you to Cairo now , where our Ivan Watson is standing by . \nAnd Ivan , can you tell us what you were able to gather from the events as they unfolded at the Interior Ministry , where we understand that several people were shot , and tell us what you witnessed ? \nIVAN WATSON , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : That 's right . \nRandi , what we saw was on the doorstep of a mosque a few blocks away from the Interior Ministry . \nThere was a makeshift clinic set up . \nAnd we were watching young men come in , in shock , and their faces started to turn green from loss of blood after just having been shot . \nSome of the bystanders said that these were plastic or rubber bullets . \nAnd they 're right on the scene there amid the prayer mats outside the mosque . \nDoctors in dirty , bloody lab coats were swabbing these puncture wounds I saw , some in one man 's stomach . \nAnother young man had been shot in the hand and was getting bandaged there . \nAnd one of the doctors there , he said that since about 3:00 in the afternoon , and at 6:30 local time here , over the course of about three hours , they had treated some 60 people with these kinds of presumably plastic rubber bullet wounds . \nIn addition to that , Randi , we saw another man wrapped in an Egyptian flag with his feet bound , apparently the body of a man being carried through the streets by a chanting crowd . \nAnd a weeping man there telling us that he had been , in fact , shot and killed by the Interior Ministry . \nI got a lot of warnings from bystanders saying do not go too close up , there are snipers on the roofs there -- Randi . \nMANN : Ivan , it 's Jonathan Mann . \nJust to be very clear about this , as best you know , this challenge , this fight for the Interior Ministry , is it still ongoing ? \nWATSON : Hard for us to tell . \nWe did hear what sounded like a few gunshots within the last 10 minutes , and I have heard at least one other burst of gunshots over the course of the last three to four hours there . \nI have to point out , I was n't able to get close to that building , but one man , after hearing some of these claims coming from -- I saw at least four young men with these kinds of injuries , Jon . \nAnother man said , `` Listen , the people in the Interior Ministry are afraid of the crowd , and they 're just trying to defend themselves from when the mob gets too close to their building . '' \nSo two different versions of what may be happening there . \nBut there 's no question that amid the scenes of elation , Jon , that we 've seen , truly a festive atmosphere in the square just a few blocks from the Interior Ministry . \nWe 've also had very bloody clashes going on , and a number of injuries , as well as at least one death . \nKAYE : Yet , despite the blood , Ivan , despite the shooting , despite the tear gas , these protesters do n't seem to be giving up . \nIn fact , they seem to be growing stronger . \nIs that how it appears to you ? \nIt 's really remarkable . \nAnd we are hearing about clashes in one place -- area , Randi , but I have to say , for the most part , it is the people in the streets who appear to be in charge . \nThey 're climbing on to the Egyptian military 's tanks . \nThey 're riding around on them , cheering , embracing the soldiers , praying next to the soldiers ' tanks . \nAnd they 're cheering . \nAnd it 's a curious combination , Randi , of elation -- elation at being free and being able to say things that people have n't been able to say in a long time . \nAnd also real hatred for the Egyptian regime . \nSo when I ask people , are they angry , you kind of get a mix of , `` Yes , I 'm furious at this government , I want Hosni Mubarak to go . '' \nAnd then they say , `` But I 'm so proud to be an Egyptian because I finally get to stand up and be proud to speak my own mind . '' \nKAYE : Ivan Watson for us in Cairo . \nIt 's so great to have you there , Ivan , and really bring us the story as it 's unfolding , along with so many of our other correspondents around the region . \nWe 're going to have to take one very quick break . \nAnd we will be right back with the very latest . \nMANN : Welcome back to our continuing coverage of the upheaval in Egypt . \nA short time ago , we had one of our reporters say that he spoke with a Muslim cleric who said that protesters were n't following his leadership , they were following the leadership of Facebook . \nIt 's an extraordinary thing . \nSocial media , Facebook included , Twitter have been a galvanizing force in the protests that we 've seen in Egypt . \nCNN 's Mohammed Jamjoom is following that part of the story for us . \nMohammed , what is the latest ? \nIs social media back up . \nIs the Internet back up in Egypt ? \nMOHAMMED JAMJOOM , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Well , Randi , the Internet is still not back up in Egypt , but mobile phone service has been up intermittently throughout the day . \nAnd what we 're seeing is a lot of users have been able to use mobile phone networks in order to try to get their messages out on social media . \nNow , we have seen some new iReports . \nThere 's an iReporter that sent us this video actually close to Jilali -LRB- ph -RRB- Square in Cairo . \nThis is taken from the balcony of a hotel close by . \nYou see all these protesters , many of them looking to be from all ages , lots of different protesters out there in the streets today . \nIf I can take you up to this screen as well , we 're getting tweets now . \nYesterday , we were getting very few tweets purportedly out of Cairo . \nToday , quite a few more . \nThis tweet : `` I know this is farfetched , but if any doctors could help in downtown , a small mosque next to Koshari El Tahrir where injured are kept . '' \nThat 's a plea for help from any doctors that might be in that area . \nWe ca n't verify it , but that 's what this person on Twitter is saying . \nHere 's another tweet . \n`` Live rounds litter the ground leading up to the Interior Ministry . \nEverything on the ground floor looted and trashed . '' \n`` The biggest crowd to date in Tahrir now huge , bigger than the January 25th sit-in that started it all . \nWhole families , children . \nIt 's a jubilant atmosphere , '' says this Twitter user . \nThis one , `` Do n't believe the lie . \nNo one in the streets of Egypt was chanting to get Omar Suleiman as president . '' \nNow , Omar Suleiman was just appointed vice president , not president . \nBut nonetheless , indicative of the mood there , purportedly out of Cairo . \nAnd this one , `` The Egyptian people are protecting public and private properties , and organizing traffic and protecting each other . '' \nVery interesting to see Twitter users , purportedly out of Cairo , now tweeting once more . \nIt will be interesting to see if the Internet is finally back up and running in the next few hours or the next few days to see how much more the traffic increases and what people will be saying , because as you said before , social media has been such a galvanizing force , has been such an integral part of getting people out and into the streets to demonstrate what 's going on in Egypt right now -- Randi . \nMANN : We 're seeing a lot of this , and we 're grateful for everything we 're learning off of social media . \nBut one question you have to ask is , obviously , we 're reading it , you 're reading it in English . \nNow , Mohammed , you 're a fluent Arabic speaker , obviously . \nHow different are the messages that are being sent , shared for Arabic speakers ? \nJAMJOOM : Well , what we 've seen so far , a lot of it has been very similar in sentiment . \nI mean , there have been a lot of angry tweets with regards to the vice president being appointed . \nA lot of reaction on social media is that this is n't going to change anything . \nBut as far as the pleas for help , as far as the atmosphere of jubilation , as far as people being happy to be able to tweet and to be able to use social media as a rallying cry , you 're seeing the same sentiment being done in Arabic and English . \nBut it is interesting that you 're seeing so many tweets in English out of Cairo right now -- Jonathan . \nMANN : Mohammed Jamjoom monitoring the Internet and social media for us . \nKAYE : You know , it 's so interesting , just quickly , to mention that tweet that he was saying he got about people asking for doctors to help at this mosque in Cairo . \nThat 's actually from CNN 's Mary Rogers -LRB- ph -RRB- , who is there at the scene , who had reported that five people had died from gunshot wounds . \nAlso at that triage center , according to a physician there , also asking for doctors . \nSo it 's amazing how we 're getting it , they 're getting it , it 's all happening and we 're all over it . \nMANN : And a point to make , we 're following those stories , taking them very seriously . \nI have been in another context we do n't have to go into where the Red Cross as also getting those tweets . \nPeople do take those kinds of messages very seriously , and so social media saves lives in a situation like this . \nAnd clearly they needed help , and we 're getting the message out there . \nAgain , a quick break . \nWe 'll be right back . \nEgypt has a new vice president . \nEgypt has a new prime minister . \nBut Egypt still has the same man in charge , Hosni Mubarak , and he 's doing his best to hold on while thousands of demonstrators gather in the streets of at least two cities that we 're monitoring closely , demanding he resign . \nOur extensive coverage is continuing . \nKAYE : And people in Egypt are really trying to digest all of these changes as it happens . \nWe want to take you to Cairo now , where an Egyptian-American communications consultant , Maha -- we 're not going to use her last name for her safety there . \nBut Maha , if you can , can you tell us a little bit about the mood there and what you 're feeling among the people in Cairo ? \nMAHA , COMMUNICATIONS CONSULTANT : Well , we 're feeling a level of uncertainty right now , I think . \nWe 're monitoring the situation on television to see scenes of what 's taking place . \nWe 're at home . \nA lot of my friends are at home . \nWe 've been calling each other today to check on each other to make sure everyone 's OK . \nWe do n't have Internet access , so we 're not able to fully see the scene and understand what 's going on in the world around us , but we do have televisions , we 're able to communicate with friends and family . \nThe situation is that -- we see from the streets -- is that there needs to be kind of a restoration of order . \nI think the main concern now is that things get under control , that we feel safe , that we feel the streets are under control . \nThere are protesters on the streets , it looks peaceful , but we hear sporadic stories of burglaries and looting and stuff like that . \nSo that makes us uneasy and nervous . \nBut we 're all staying home , we 're all just checking on each other , and we 're monitoring the situation , hoping for calm . \nMANN : Maha , this is Jonathan Mann . \nAnd as we 're talking to you , we 're looking at these extraordinary pictures , these crowds that have gathered along some of the biggest thoroughfares in some of the major squares of Cairo . \nBut I 'm curious about the rest of the city and how ordinary people are getting by . \nCan you buy milk ? \nCan your kids go out to play ? \nAre people talking about what they 're going to do when the workweek starts ? \nAre they going to go actually try to go to work , as many do on Sunday or Monday ? \nMAHA : Well , they 've already announced that the banks are closed tomorrow , the central bank is closed tomorrow , and the stock market is closed tomorrow . \nI advised my staff , we 're obviously not going to work tomorrow . \nOne of my friends tried to go get groceries this morning . \nShe said there was a huge line at one of the main supermarkets and she could n't get what she needed . \nWe 're all staying home . \nI think on Thursday -- those of us that planned ahead kind of braced ourselves . \nAnd I 've never been in a hurricane , but on Friday , yesterday , I kind of felt this is what it 's like , where you brace yourself for a storm , and you just sit and wait . \nSo you ca n't really leave your house , you should n't leave your house . \nWe need to respect that there 's a curfew and it 's there for our safety . \nAnd so we 're basically sitting tight and kind of talking to each other and watching what you 're all watching on TV . \nMANN : I do n't want to put words into your mouth , but it sounds like apart from the scenes we 're seeing , a lot of Cairo would be a ghost town today . \nI guess some people tried to move around today , and they just said it 's not safe to move around . \nThe main squares and the main areas downtown , they are seeing a lot of foot traffic , and a lot of people are venturing out , I think . \nI know people are n't able to get to their families in other parts of the towns , so everyone is just staying home . \nKAYE : All right . \nMaha , an Egyptian-American in Cairo with some interesting perspective . \nMANN : Of course the unrest that we 've been watching in Egypt is n't isolated . \nOver the past few weeks , we 've seen turmoil in several neighboring countries . \nTunisia , most notably , but Yemen as well . \nWe 've been following that development , but if you 're just joining us now , let me bring you up to date with what 's going on in Egypt itself . \nThe region is watching nervously because there 's a new prime minister , there 's a new vice president . \nHosni Mubarak is trying very hard to stay in power . \nKAYE : Well , as we 've been mentioning , none of this is isolated . \nWe 've seen problems in other parts of the region . \nWe 're getting some confusing signals there . \nI just want to make sure we all know where we 're going . \nBut the bottom line is this -- the most powerful Arab nation , a pillar of the region , is now in turmoil . \nThe president is doing his best to hold on , but the rest of the region also is being affected . \nEgypt 's not isolated . \nWe 've seen the turmoil , and we 're watching it unfold . \nKAYE : And over the past few weeks we 've seen turmoil in several neighboring countries , as we mentioned , but does that mean that these protests really , throughout the region , are the same ? \nWe 've seen so many different protesters , so we put that question to Josh Levs earlier this morning . \nJOSH LEVS , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Well , here 's the thing , big picture they kind of are about the same things . \nBut there are specific situations in each country that have gotten a lot of people upset . \nIt 's important to understand these differences , especially as we are seeing all these videos come in . \nAnd let 's get back to Egypt for just a second . \nWe 'll take a look at this video . \nI have been speaking with all these experts on this scene . \nAnd all these countries in recent days , the way one expert put it to me , he said they all want the same thing . \nIt 's about inequalities , it is about a lack of opportunities . \nIt is about the rich getting richer . \nIt is about what demonstrators feel is a totalitarian regime , or aspects of a totalitarian regime in each country . \nAnd something important to understand here , we were just talking about the make-up of these protests . \nWe do have a lot of people who are middle class ; a lot of educated people , a lot of young educated people . \nAnd there is a term that might be new to you all this morning , but it is not new to those who follow revolutions through history . \nIt 's called the blocked elite , Randi . \nThis is a group of people who are educated and believe they should be elite . \nBecause they know how to take on major jobs , they feel they should have major jobs inside their countries . \nAnd they feel that what 's been happening is stopping them . \nThey believe it is because of the government . \nAnd decisions made from the government are preventing them from more advanced jobs inside of their countries . \nSo -- KAYE : The common theme is really they think they deserve more . \nThey believe they deserve more , they believe that they can play a major role , they believe that economically , they should be at a higher level . \nAnd we can quickly show you . \nI mean , we 've had videos from what 's been going on in Tunisia as well , and then you had smaller protests take place inside Algeria and Yemen . \nThere are specifics scenarios inside each country to keep in mind , and it 's important to mention that . \nFor example , in Algeria and Yemen , you 've had civil wars in the past . \nSo that 's a backdrop , whereas in Tunisia , you have a more of a homogeneous population . \nAll of these affect the way that these rebellions play out , but big picture , Randi , we are looking at a lot of middle class people , a lot of young people who are pushing hard for what they believe is their place in society . \nKAYE : And as the protests continue in the region and throughout Egypt , we do want to just remind you that we 're now seeing already the cabinet has officially resigned , we have a new vice president in Egypt , apparently going to be sworn in any time now . \nA new prime minister as well . \nIn terms of numbers , we 're being told that at least 38 are dead . \nThe shootings continue at the Interior Ministry . \nWe have our correspondents spread throughout the region , and we will continue to stay on top of this . \nMANN : Extraordinary upheaval in a country that had long been considered really one of the most stable in the region , a pillar of Western policy , a close ally of the United States . \nAll of that very much in question . \nI 'm Jonathan Mann . \nKAYE : And I 'm Randi Kaye . \nThanks for being with us throughout this very busy morning . \nThe news continues after this . \n"}

{"id": "56", "time": "2011-01-29", "text": "Egyptian protesters gather around the national television building as members of the presidential guard stand by Friday in Cairo . \nMubarak called out the army Friday to help quell the protests The military will play a key role in what happens next In the past , the state-run media have ignored protests or downplayed them Friday , Nile TV showed the clashes but also justified the crackdown -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As mass protests swept Egypt on Friday , the actions of two key institutions served as indicators for what lies ahead for the embattled regime : the military and the media . \nPresident Hosni Mubarak deployed the Egyptian army for the first time to the streets to quell angry demonstrations against his authoritarian regime . \nThat 's a sure sign of the government 's desperation , according to experts on the region . \nAnd for the first time , the state-run media did n't ignore the unrest or dump on the demonstrations as acts of terrorism in its usual manner . \nThat , too , say experts , was a key indicator that Mubarak could be facing trouble . \nIt 's a given that the military , a pillar of Egyptian authority since a 1952 coup toppled the monarchy , holds the keys at this critical juncture . \nMany feared that the army will silence the protesters with its firepower and tanks that are now out on the streets of Cairo and Alexandria . \nBut Edward Walker , a former U.S. ambassador to Egypt , said that a military crackdown would be a `` death knell not only to the military but the regime . '' \nSuch a crackdown did n't happen in nearby Tunisia , where the authoritarian ruler fled the nation , and it was hardly what happened in Egypt on Friday . \nOn the contrary , Egypt 's 450,000-strong armed forces are well-established and respected by the people . \nJournalists reported seeing protesters cheer army convoys as they drove into Cairo and Alexandria . \nSome embraced the soldiers on the ground ; they were seen as saviors from excessive police brutality . \nU.S. reacts to Egypt turmoil To Mohammed el-Nawawy , a professor at Queens University in North Carolina , the fact that the military was called out Friday showed that Mubarak was desperate . \nThe all-important question is how loyal the armed forces will remain to the aging leader who has ruled Egypt with an iron fist for three decades . \nMeanwhile , the state-controlled television network walked a tightrope Friday . \nEarly in the day , Nile TV began showing footage of the demonstrations of `` tens of thousands of people '' and reported the use of police tear gas . \nIt aired opposition leaders criticizing the government for shutting down the lines of communication . \nShawn Powers , a Georgia State University assistant professor who studies international media , said it was unusual for an arm of the government to even cover these events or portray them as anything but acts initiated by unsavory elements of society . \n`` I 'm amazed , '' Powers said of the coverage . \nEven with social media and mobile phone messaging blocked , Egyptians could see events unfolding live on international networks including CNN . \nThe Egyptian media may have felt that they would lose all credibility with the people if they were to completely distort the story . \nEgypt : Revolution captured in real time Ultimately , Powers said , he suspected fissures within Mubarak 's ranks and said some in the government may be thinking of their own future in a nation barely holding back from the brink . \n`` What we 're seeing today is parts of the government feeling increasingly isolated from Mubarak or intentionally doing so to hold on to power after Mubarak goes , '' he said . \nBy the end of the day , however , Nile TV 's coverage shifted , reverting to words like `` hooliganism '' and `` lawlessness '' to describe the demonstrations . \nEl-Nawawy , who has studied Egyptian media in depth , said Friday 's media coverage could mean that Mubarak has no one left to blame , so he gave the protesters , many of whom are young people , a little wiggle room . \n`` The state media is walking a fine line to give credit to the young people , but in the meantime , it has to justify intervention and crackdown , '' el-Nawawy said . \nEl-Nawawy said things will get really thorny if Egypt 's impoverished masses join hands with the protesters -- believed to be largely from the educated middle classes -- and the demonstrations grow to even more chaotic proportions . \nThat 's when the military and the state-run media will both have to come to terms with events in their country . \nThat 's when Mubarak , el-Nawawy said , may realize that he can shut down Facebook but not the People 's Book . \n"}

{"id": "267", "time": "2011-01-29", "text": "January 29 , 2011 | By Shadi Hamid , Special to CNN With a mixture of anticipation and apprehension , the world is watching the largest pro-democracy protests in the history of Egypt and perhaps the Arab world . \nEgypt will never go back to what it was yesterday . \nTomorrow , we will wake up to a new and different Egypt . \nWhat will that Egypt look like ? \nIt is likely the beginning of the end for one of the longest serving authoritarian regimes -- as well as one of the most closely allied with the United States . \nThe implications of such a shift , even if it does n't produce an outright revolution , are considerable . \nThe regime of President Hosni Mubarak tried everything . \nIt took the unprecedented step of blocking internet and cell phone service , stripping Egyptians of the ability to communicate with each other in the most basic ways . \nPolice have fired on protesters with rubber bullets . \nThey 've beaten them and sprayed tear gas . \nBut , remarkably , the protests only seemed to grow . \nThis is what a revolution looks like : Protestors overwhelming police ; everyday , ordinary citizens taking to the streets for the first time . \nIt may get messier still . \nWhat happens if police forces or the army decide to use live ammunition ? \nWhat happens if protestors overtake a number of government buildings ? \nAlready , the Egyptian regime has effectively lost control of parts of its own territory . \nIt is worth remembering that revolutions do not happen overnight . \nThe question , then , is whether protesters can sustain their momentum over a longer period of time . \nSimilarly , can the Egyptian regime sustain weeks or months of protests that effectively shut down the country ? \nTourism , one of Egypt 's most important industries , will suffer . \nAlready , the stock market is in free fall . \nThe streets of Cairo have become a war zone , complete with Molotov cocktails and broken barricades . \nConsidering the costs , the regime has little choice but to move quickly to offer concessions to the people , in the form of more jobs , more freedoms and a more honest government . \nAlong these lines , the Obama administration urged the Mubarak regime to take these events as an opportunity to institute long-needed reforms . \nThis might seem a prudent course . \nBut , as the protesters have made clear , they do n't want a better regime . \nThey want a different regime . \n"}

\nSESAY : Anyone at home who is wondering that question should listen up . \nThe bottom line is Egypt , which owns the Suez Canal , has given the U.S. preferential access to it so its warships can go through as well as giving us access to its air space , all critical to the U.S. in terms of any kind of operations it 's doing in the region . \nThe bottom line is Egypt 's the U.S. most important strategic partner in the region . \nIt 's a relationship that dates back to the 1970s . \nIf someone wants a price tag it 's costing the U.S. billions of dollars a year . \nThat 's how important it is to this country . \nEgypt is very much seen as a counterweight in many ways . \nIt 's seen as a moderating influence there in the region . \nAnd many people say as Egypt goes , so the region goes . \nMANN : A point about Egypt 's moderating role , Hosni Mubarak is largely responsible for that . \nBut if you think about the Specter of Islamic fundamentalism , Islamism as a movement was born in Egypt . \nThe Brotherhood is the most Islamist organization in the world . \nIt has links to group like Hamas and around the world . \nBut the Muslim Brotherhood has been on Hosni Mubarak 's target list for years . \nIt was a country that was casualty to Islamic terrorism . \nHosni Mubarak crushed it . \nWhat 's so extraordinary about the pictures we 're seeing today these are n't Islamists , these are n't agitators . \nThese are the ordinary people of the country . \nBut once again , this country has been a bulwark against the kind of Islamism that so terrifies Washington . \nHosni Mubarak is the personification of that . \nWithout Hosni Mubarak , what happens now ? \nSESAY : To that point about the Muslim Brotherhood , which was banned all the way back in 1954 , let 's be clear on that , it is a group that started with violent roots and it has renounced that violence , to be very clear . \nIt has a lot of young educated people in its ranks . \nA lot of people who enter government these days who are members of the Muslim Brotherhood because it 's a band organization , they join as nominal independents . \nThat 's the way they get in . \nBut it 's still an important organizing force and opposition voice there in Egypt . \nKAYE : And they do support ElBaradei . \nSESAY : They say they do . \nMANN : There 's another Washington angle to this which is really crucial . \nI would be so curious to hear from the second President Bush today . \nPresident Bush had the freedom agenda . \nHe said that the people of the Middle East were crying out for the democratic rights that Americans take for granted . \nThere was a lot of cynicism by people in Egypt and cynicism by people in the United States , but this is evidence that he was right . \nWhen I visited Egypt to cover some of the early political efforts during his year in power , people said if it were n't for President Bush , their own political movements would be crushed . \nIn time their movements were crushed . \nThe Bush administration made a choice and in a sense was less vocal about it than it might be . \nBut this has been U.S. policy under the Bush administration a little less so under the Obama administration , to encourage the spread of democracy in Egypt . \nSo why should Washington care ? \nThis was policy for this country under President Bush . \nIt 's policy that 's been changed , and we 're now seeing a little bit of discomfort as the Obama administration grapples with the repercussions here , because , once again , Egypt matters to Washington . \nKAYE : We talk about this ripple effect or the concern of this ripple effect or the Tunisian effect now that we 've seen what happened in Tunisia and what 's happening now in Egypt . \nIsha , what would you say would be the next greatest concern ? \nAnd how concerned should the U.S. be about this spreading ? \nSESAY : I think that the U.S. should look very closely at Yemen because we have seen protests there in Yemen . \nLet 's talk about the similarities as we talk about this Tunisian effect , this domino effect that many have talked about at great length . \nThe bottom line is you have a lot of these Arab countries that have these aging rulers who have been in power for decades . \nThey have young population , they have high unemployment . \nI mean , according to one statistic I read , in the case of Egypt itself , it may have the highest unemployment among educated classes in the world , so to give you some insight into what 's taking place on the ground . \nBut in places like Yemen , in places like Libya , Algeria , all these countries that are grappling were leaders in power for a long time , people have had enough . \nAnd Yemen in particular where we have Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula , the U.S. should be paying attention to we saw protests there on Friday . \nPeople saying Salah he must go . \nThe question is , if you remove these people who have had some kind of uneasy calm for a length of time , what fills the vacuum ? \nKAYE : This is a fascinating discussion that we 'll have to continue . \nFor the meantime , you know the diplomatic community is watching what 's going on in Egypt very closely . \nCNN 's Senior State Department producer Elise Labott is live in Washington with the latest developments on that front . \nElise , what 's happening there in Washington and at the State Department ? \nELISE LABOTT , CNN SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT PRODUCER : Well , Randi , you really see the administration walking this very fine balance between wanting to support the protesters , making sure that their rights are respected , that the government does n't crack down , but at the same time really sending the message to the Mubarak regime that if you are going to be in power , and that is something Egyptians are going to have to decide , you need to make meaningful reforms . \nAs we heard from President Obama and many members of the administration that we talked to , that speech was not good enough . \nPresident Mubarak did not give any hint that he 'll allow more political inclusion , that he 's going to provide more jobs , more opportunities . \nAnd just a reshuffling of the cabinet , a reshuffling of the deck , you say , is n't going to suffice . \nAnd there 's really been a debate in this administration about how far to go on the reform issue . \nYou were just talking about that . \nAnd the issue is it was anything but the Bush administration 's policy . \nThis administration came in wanting to distance itself from the Bush administration . \nThey did not emphasize the reform issue for that reason . \nBut in the last few months there 's been a debate in the administration about how much to pick up on this . \nShould we be talking about this ? \nYou heard Secretary Clinton talking at a forum in Qatar a few weeks ago saying , listen , Arab leaders , if you do not reform , if you do not answer some the social unrest , the economic unrest that your people are talking about and protesting on the streets and clamoring for change , your regimes are going to sink in the sand . \nSo there 's been a very -- that was a dire prediction , you would say , and there 's really been a ramping up , I think , of the administration 's policy on pushing reform . \nI think now they 're finally getting it . \nYou will see a more consistent message from the administration . \nLet 's listen to what Secretary Clinton had to say yesterday about the need for reform in Egypt . \nHILLARY CLINTON , U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE : These protests underscore that there are deep grievances within Egyptian society , and the Egyptian government needs to understand that violence will not make these grievances go away . \nAs President Obama said yesterday , reform is absolutely critical to the well-being of Egypt . \nEgypt has long been an important partner of the United States on a range of regional issues . \nAs a partner , we strongly believe that the Egyptian government needs to engage immediately with the Egyptian people in implementing needed economic , political , and social reforms . \nLABOTT : So a various ramping up of the administration 's message to President Mubarak . \nBut at the same time , as we 've been discussing all morning , we really do n't know what comes next . \nSo the administration is really looking at what 's happening in Egypt , looking at other countries like Jordan , like Yemen , as you mentioned , about what happens next . \nThey really do n't know . \nAnd so they 're really saying anything short of suggesting for regime change , but they really would like to see -- I 've heard the phrase recently `` managed change . '' \nThey 'd like to see Egypt move towards elections , move towards more political inclusion , and the September elections down the line could give space for that . \nBut if President Mubarak does not institute some of the reform , you heard President Obama and his spokesmen say that there 's a lot of U.S. aid on the line here and the U.S. will be reviewing its assistance to Egypt . \nKAYE : And Elise , before we let you go , just very quickly , I want you to react to a tweet from the State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley saying the United States remains , quote , `` concerned about the potential for violence in Egypt and urges restraint on all sides . '' \nVery quickly , your reaction ? \nLABOTT : I think they 're really focusing on the rights right now . \nThe rights , restoring the Internet , you saw a little bit of the phone companies and the Internet being restored , really focusing on the rights right now of the people , making sure that there is not a massive crackdown . \nObviously the speech we heard was n't enough for the administration , but right now they 're really focusing on making sure that the situation does n't spiral out of control and we see a lot of deaths and arrests , particularly of journalists , Randi . \nKAYE : All right , thanks for your insight , we 'll check back with you . \nHistory unfolding in Egypt , the government resigns but President Hosni Mubarak is n't going anywhere . \nAnd protesters are out in full force again . \nKAYE : Welcome back . \nIt 's 15 minute past the hour . \nNick Lewandowski is a writer and editor in Cairo who was interviewed earlier in the week on CNN . \nHe is joining us now . \nNick , can you tell us where you are in Cairo , and what you 're seeing ? \nNICK LEWANDOWSKI , WITNESS : Right now I 'm actually away from the demonstrations that are downtown . \nI 'm in my apartment in Manira , which is across from basically the Four Seasons hotel and the embassy district where the American and British embassies are . \nRight now we 're hearing sporadic gunfire coming from what sounds like downtown . \nIt is not clear to us again from this vantage point , whether that gunfire is being fired at people or just in to the air to disperse them . \nThere was a 4:00 curfew . \nWhen 4:00 rolled , though , around there were still large numbers of people downtown on the streets . \nWe heard that people are basically trying to storm the ministry of the interior downtown and the police and military units down there have reacted by shooting rounds , live rounds . \nKAYE : I know that you sent us some iReports yesterday . \nWhat do you see in terms of a difference in the crowd or the anger or the trust rags , maybe even the level of violence from one day to the next ? \nLEWANDOWSKI : In terms of what we saw yesterday , I was out on the street all day starting at the al Aqsa mosque and making my way back to the center of town . \nWhat we were seeing everywhere on the streets was a battle , a street battle between protesters and police . \nAnd what we saw happen throughout the day was the protesters no longer were afraid to confront the police directly . \nThere were instances where we seeing them picking up tear gas canisters and throwing them back into the police lines . \nWe saw people who were basically unafraid to go toe to toe with the police units . \nAnd then as evening came around , of course t level of violence did seem to ratchet up . \nWe saw Molotov cocktails being thrown near the 15th of May bridge . \nPolice trucks were being burned , there were cars burned out . \nAt that point really , the people had taken the streets downtown , and there was a gap period downtown where there was a great deal of looting and really no one was in control until the army units were moved in later in the evening . \nAnd this morning things were a lot calmer . \nArmored personnel carriers at intervals spaced out downtown . \nEarlier in the day things were comparatively -- KAYE : Are you in the street or where are you ? \nLEWANDOWSKI : I 'm actually in an apartment where I live right now . \nKAYE : OK , I was just wondered who we hear there talking next to you . \nSo we 're now about an hour past when this curfew took effect , more than an hour past . \nAny word on what will happen to the people who remain on the street and ignore this curfew ? \nAnd obviously they 're not concerned about that . \nWell , the big issue is there is not -- especially for those of us who do n't speak Arabic fluently , it is difficult for us to get information at this point because we do n't have Internet access . \nWe do not have access other than satellite television to news outlets that are reporting , you know , reliability this information in English . \nWe heard that there was a curfew . \nWe were coming out and visiting friends who were holed up . \nAnd the guys at the hotel were pulling potted plants and boarding the front . \nJournalists need to get out there , and there was a curfew and a great bit of dispute . \nThere was no announcement of the consequences and how -- if there is a curfew is also probably questionable . \nKAYE : All right . \nNick Lewandowski , we 'll leave it there . \nThank you for sharing your story with us . \nLEWANDOWSKI : You 're very welcome . \nKAYE : The protesters planned the demonstration and rallied the troops , but on Thursday , actually , the government shut it down . \nWe 'll tell you where that stands . \nIn the meantime , we 'll take a very quick break . \nBe sure to stay with us because we have correspondents and cameras all over the region , and we 'll bring you everything as it happens . \nMANN : Five day of upheaval in Egypt continue . \nNow reports that president Hosni Mubarak has for the first time in nearly three decades in power name a vice president to serve under him . \nYou recall he fired his government . \nHe now has a new second in command . \nEarly indications are it 's a man with a history of involvement in intelligence . \nOur Mohammed Jamjoom joins us now . \nMohammed , the name is not familiar to most of us , but Omar Suleman , what do we know about him ? \nMOHAMMED JAMJOOM , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : Pardon me . \nJonathan , in effect we were just going to talk to you about social media and what we 're seeing right now out of Egypt . \nLet me just show you some of the tweets that are coming out even though the Internet has effectively been shut down across Egypt since yesterday , we actually have an iReport video that came out from the hotel walking through the streets . \nYou can see demonstrators . \nLook like to be of all ages . \nCould be thousands walking through going there through Tahrir Square in Cairo . \nThis is someone tweeting out of Cairo , `` I am hearing the biggest crowd ever is going in Tahrir Square . '' \nP.J. Crowley , the State Department spokesman , `` With protesters still on the streets of Egypt , we remain concerned about the potential for violence and again urge restraint on all sides . '' \nAlso we can look at some photos . \nThis is the party headquarters still smoldering . \nHere is the trends map from twitter to show how popular the term and the hash-tag Egypt is across the world . \nThis is a headline map , what 's popular on CNN.com , what 's being e-mailed a lot on CNN.com , `` Protesters head toward the heart of Cairo . \nMixed reaction in the Middle East . \nWho is holding the cards in Egypt ? \nEgyptian president dissolves government . '' \nThere is still an Internet block , nonetheless people are trying to get the message out . \nProtesters are trying even through their mobile phones on how to be out on the streets and protest today . \nMANN : As we watch all this unfold , one thing that you 're struck by is the cooperation that the Egyptian government has received from cell phone companies , from Internet providers . \nAre you surprised by that ? \nOr is that the way they would normally behave in a time of crisis ? \nJAMJOOM : What 's been interesting is that what happened was unprecedented in Internet history . \nWhat happened yesterday is at a certain time effectively everything was cut off . \nWe 've heard that there might be one Internet service provider that was still kept open and that maybe some of the banks in Egypt are still able to do banking online . \nNonetheless , completely shut down . \nAnd it is a government shutdown . \nAnd that has really added fuel to the fire in Egypt because people who were not maybe using social media , people wanting to use their mobile phones and wanted to get online have not been able to . \nSo it really caused a lot more anger toward the government than the government anticipated . \nMANN : What is quite extraordinary -- and this is amazing when you think about it , they 've gone through great efforts to shut down social media . \nThey 've sent crews to attack one of our journalists . \nOne of our camera crews their camera was taken and destroyed . \nBut state-run media has continued to broadcast these extraordinary pictures . \nSo it seems they do n't want the independent media to report what 's going on . \nThey do n't want ordinary people spreading the word , but within Hosni Mubarak 's own apparatus , someone is putting these pictures on television anyway . \nJAMJOOM : John , that 's a very good point . \nYesterday quite extraordinary what we were seeing on Nile TV , state-run Egyptian television , before the curfew was imposed , you were seeing opposition speaking , you were seeing the protests , you were seeing clashes , then after the curfew was imposed it went to more generic pictures . \nYou were seeing a more placid view . \nYou were n't seeing the worst of it . \nToday if you look side by side of pictures of what 's on Nile TV , state-run television and the other nets that are there , including CNN , it 's a much different picture . \nThat holds true to a lot of state-run television networks in the Middle East , when there 's violence going on , you are n't seeing the worth of it . \nSide by side , Egyptian Nile television compared to the other networks , you see a real stark difference . \nMANN : The government of China has an extraordinary apparatus to monitor the Internet and some other countries as well . \nPeople can be -- well , they can be in jeopardy just for tweeting . \nHow much do we know how closely Egypt watches its Internet , its tweets , its people online ? \nJAMJOOM : We know from detentions of bloggers in the past before any of this and harassment of bloggers in the past in Egypt that there has been a crackdown , especially when it comes to online activism . \nEgypt has been accused by human rights groups of really cracking down on people that have been involved in activism online . \nThey 've been accused of beating to death even bloggers . \nIn fact one of the icons of this movement is somebody is very much heavily involved in online activism , and he was allegedly beaten to death by security forces last year . \nThat caused a huge amount of rage amongst the Egyptian people in the past several months , and his picture is one of the pictures that 's really being sent around by a lot of people behind this movement to try to compel people to get out into the streets . \nSo , yes , Egypt is authoritarian when it comes to these types of things . \nThey have in the past gone after people who they think are trying to use online activism to be dissenters , to go after the government . \nAs of now , we 're not hearing reports , mainly because of the online shutdown , because there is no Internet . \nIf people have been tweeting or managed to get around the blockage , we 'll probably hear more about that in day to come . \nMANN : Mohammed Jamjoom reporting for us . \nEgypt is maintaining control of the web . \nFive days of upheaval in Hosni Mubarak 's Egypt . \nThe Egyptian president is holding on , but he 's fired his cabinet and now appointed a new vice president for first time in three decades . \nCNN 's extensive coverage of the events in Egypt will continue after this . \nKAYE : Let 's get you up to date here on CNN . \nThank you to our international viewers who are joining us as well . \nYou are looking at pictures there of Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak . \nThis is new video coming in to us at CNN , new video of Hosni Mubarak along with the vice president that he has just appointed . \nOmar Suleiman is his name . \nAnd apparently , according to U.S. diplomatic cables , he 's been mentioned several times as a possible transitional leader , even should Mubarak go . \nMANN : Just a hint of what the president has in mind . \nSuleiman is the director of Egyptian intelligence . \nEven some time ago one media account called him the fixer in the shadows , a man who has taken on some of the president 's worst enemies , the Islamists , the terrorists who threatened Egypt and threatened massive upheaval in that country . \nThat problem went away . \nSuleiman is the man apparently who did it . \nSESAY : I was just going to jump in there and add that the question we all have to ask ourselves is whether this move by Mubarak will be enough to quell these protests , if this kind of reform for the masses on the streets remains to be seen . \nKAYE : The death toll now rising from the anti-government demonstrations that we 've been watching for days , right now we know at least 38 people have died in clashes between protesters and police . \nTen of the dead are police officers . \nThe protesters want new leaders . \nAnd today there is a move toward that . \nA short time ago the cabinet handed in their resignations . \nBut the main target of the protesters ' anger is n't going anywhere . \nPresident Hosni Mubarak has been defiant to this point . \n-LRB- BEGIN VIDEO CLIP -RRB- MUBARAK : I take responsibility for the security of this country and the citizens . \nI will not let this happen . \nI will not let fear live in the citizens or to let this tell us what 's going to happen in the future . \nKAYE : And we are seeing an increased military presence in major cities , especially in Cairo . \nTanks and soldiers have taken up positions among the demonstrators . \nWe 've seen the interior ministry . \nMany folks gather there , tens of thousands of people gather there , gunfire reported . \nOur witnesses there , eyewitnesses who have joined us by phone telling us that two people were shot . \nNow , though , more and more tanks are moving in to place . \nA curfew went into effect more than an hour ago , just about an hour and a half ago , but protesters have pretty much ignored that . \nIn fact they 're getting more emboldened by all of this . \nPeople around the world are watching these historic protests , especially in Washington where President Obama talked about the importance of real change . \nOBAMA : What 's needed right now are concrete steps that advance the rights of the Egyptian people , a meaningful dialogue between the government and its citizens , and a path of political change that leads to a future of greater freedom and greater opportunity and justice for the Egyptian people . \nSESAY : As we watch the events in Egypt , the whole world is closely watching what is unfolding there , it 's important to get reaction from the region . \nWith that , let 's go to Jerusalem and bring in CNN 's Jerusalem Bureau Chief Kevin Flower who is standing by for us . \nKevin , just getting word that Hosni Mubarak has appointed a vice president , the first time he 's done that since being in power . \nIsrael very closely watching what is going on there across the border . \nAny comments from Israeli officials at this point ? \nKEVIN FLOWER , CNN JERUSALEM BUREAU CHIEF : Isha , nothing . \nWe know that Israeli officials , they 've told us that they 're watching events very closely . \nBut that is all they 're saying . \nAnd Israeli officials , analysts and government officials assessing the first couple days of the protests in Cairo and the other parts of Egypt were saying that they thought that the government of Hosni Mubarak would be able to withstand this social upheaval . \nSome are probably reconsidering that assessment or having doubts about that assessment as they see events unfold over the past 24 hours or so . \nAnd , of course , the Egypt-Israel relationship has been a hugely important one for Israel . \nIt 's 30 years old , a 30-year peace treaty that 's been in effect . \nHosni Mubarak has been there for 28 years . \nHe is a known quantity to the Israeli government . \nHe has been around for eight Israeli prime ministers , again , a known quantity . \nSo the notion of Hosni Mubarak going away or his government radically changing that is unsettling to a lot of Israeli officials here because they do n't know what 's going to come in its place . \nAnd so some fear and apprehension about what this could bring , but nothing being expressed openly right now . \nSESAY : I 've got to ask you , are we getting anything from the Palestinian territories , anything coming out from the government of Mahmoud Abbas ? \nFLOWER : Well , it 's interesting . \nAt this point it 's equal silence from the Palestinian side . \nWhat we do know today from the Palestinian official news agency is that the Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas actually called Hosni Mubarak this morning to affirm his , quote , `` solidarity with Egypt and to express his commitment to its stability and its security . '' \nThat 's as much as we 've heard from the Palestinian authority and nothing from the Hamas rulers in the Gaza Strip either . \nSo they , just like the Israelis , are watching these events unfold . \nThey do n't know what it means . \nThey have different , you know , different stakes in this fire . \nThe Palestinian authority has been very close to Egypt . \nEgypt has been an ally enshrined to promote the Palestinian authority 's sort of stance on talking to Israel in the past . \nIn Gaza , the Hamas rulers have had a more antagonistic relationship with Egypt . \nIt will be interesting to see what they have to say in the days going forward . \nSESAY : Kevin , let me ask you this . \nWe were just telling our viewers that Hosni Mubarak has appointed Omar Suleiman as his vice president . \nWe want to know what kind of relationship he has with Israeli officials . \nDo we know anything about that ? \nFLOWER : Well , Omar Suleiman is a known quantity to this Israeli government and past Israeli governments . \nHe 's a man who has been in charge of the security apparatus in Egypt for many years , and in that capacity he has had dozens of conversations about dozens of topics with Israeli officials over the years about the role of Hamas , about the role of Hezbollah , you know , issues like the Israeli prisoner Gilad Shali , various negotiations between Hamas and the Palestinian authority . \nThis man has been involved in all of them . \nAnd he 's also been talking to Israel during that time as well . \nSo it 's a significant -- I think the Israeli government would be happy to see that he has been moved into this vice presidential position , but again , the events are still moving so quickly , I do n't think they can take any solace in it just yet . \nSESAY : Israeli officials not speaking out on this , but I wonder how this is playing with the ordinary Israeli public . \nIs this generating as much interest and concern among them as it is in other part of the world ? \nFLOWER : Well , absolutely . \nIt 's been a top story here . \nAnd Israel 's frequently a place that the media is often consumed with domestic political stories , you know , things that involve the Palestinians . \nThere have been a lot of attention paid to the Palestinian papers that came out this past week . \nBut the past two days , this has been the number one story here . \nThis is a hugely important development and a lot of Israelis are wondering -- just normal Israelis as well as government officials -- what is this going to mean for Israel going forward ? \nAre we going to have a continued ally in Egypt in the future or is that relationship going to change fundamentally ? \nAnd of course , Israel always feeling somewhat isolated in this region , surrounded by some countries that are hostile to it . \nIt 's fought wars many of its neighbors . \nIt does not want to see the relationship with Egypt deteriorate in the future . \nSESAY : CNN Jerusalem bureau chief Kevin Flower providing us with excellent analysis and perspective . \nKevin , we thank you . \nWe are going to closely follow the events as they unfold in Egypt . \nOur special coverage of this crisis will continue after a very short break . \nYou 're looking there at a picture of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak , new video in to CNN . \nWe want to show you it one more time , Hosni Mubarak along with the new vice president who is expected to be sworn in shortly , which we will , of course , bring that to you live . \nHis name is Omar Suleiman , and he 's really one of the world 's most powerful spy chiefs , apparently . \nAll of the most delicate issues for the Middle East land on his desk . \nWe want the talk about him and much more about the impact of these demonstrations on the global scene . \nMarco Vicenzino is the founder and director of Global Strategy Project . \nHe joins us now from Washington . \nMarco , first , let 's get your reaction to the appointment of this new vice president . \nMARCO VICENZINO , FOUNDER AND DIRECTOR , GLOBAL STRATEGY PROJECT : It does n't surprise me . \nArguably Omar Suleiman is the most powerful man in Egypt , arguably . \nHe 's been by the side of the president for nearly 20 years now . \nAnd the way he did so , he was a member of the security apparatus , but in the early '90s , Hosni Mubarak visited Ethiopia . \nOmar Suleiman insisted that the president take certain precautions . \nAnd the precautions he took saved his life . \nFrom that point onwards Omar Suleiman became the right hand man of Hosni Mubarak and behind the scenes he 's extremely well respected in the region , with other intelligence chiefs and has a lot of respect in Washington and is listened to in Washington . \nWhen he arrives here , it is not often announced in the media that he 's coming . \nHe 's someone is behind the scenes . \nThis is an individual who defeated what one can arguably consider the precursor to Al Qaeda . \nIn the '90s , before 9\\/11 , people tend to forget in Washington that Egypt was fighting an internal struggle with hardcore Islamists radicals . \nThe number two in Al Qaeda Ayman al Zawahiri had to flee Egypt and join bin Laden in Afghanistan because he was defeated by Omar Suleiman . \nThen what took place in Afghanistan , the fusion between Al Qaeda , the group of bin Laden and al Zawahiri 's group merged together . \nSo someone with a very impressive track record in the security field . \nKAYE : I would imagine that Hosni Mubarak trusts very few and he would certainly be in his inner circle . \nBut he 's also been described to us as a `` thug '' -- I 'm using that word , that 's a direct quote , a thug straight out of central casting . \nWhat can we expect his role to be here ? \nVICENZINO : Maintain order . \nAnd when you say he 's a thug , to defeat a movement , an Islamist movement that was a powerful movement in Egypt , you ca n't be an ordinary , nice person . \nIn situations like that in that part of the world being a thug helps , and you need the respect of people , of people within your apparatus . \nOmar Suleiman I think after the scenes of yesterday , the violence , 38 dead from what we understand , the main thing is preserving order and stability , order in the streets . \nAnd the person who can do that is , obviously , Omar Suleiman . \nHe 'll be having a more public role now , obviously . \nOperating behind the scenes for 20 years requires you to do so much , but now that you 're a public face and you 'll be out in the open , it 's a different challenge , a different test now . \nKAYE : Might we read anything into this appointment , do you think ? \nKAYE : That 's what I was going to say , do you think that could be happening here ? \nVICENZINO : A possible transitional leader . \nIn my opinion , a piece that I wrote on the CNN website , what I called for was Mr. Mubarak to renounce that he 's going to be running in the presidential elections of 2011 to offer himself and his circle a graceful exit from politics where you have an evolution over the next few months as opposed to a revolution , sort of like we saw in Tunisia . \nSo I think this is a good step in the positive direction if this is going to begin a transformation . \nAnd if that does take place , that 's in the best interests for internal Egyptian stability , for regional stability and for international order and for American interests around the world . \nKAYE : Why do you think he would be so good at bringing regional stability ? \nVICENZINO : Obviously he has good relationships ranging from the Palestinian leadership , governments throughout the region . \nAnd , once again , he 's someone -- you 're talking about a part of the world where strong individuals are often respected more than in other part , perhaps . \nSo to have that sense of stability , his track record in the '90s of maintaining order and saving -- in my opinion saving Egypt from radicals gives Mubarak -- gives Mubarak more breathing time . \nNow , do I think we 're at the point of no return where the violence is going to take off and go sort of as it went in Tunisia ? \nI do n't think so . \nI do n't think we 've reached that point of no return yet . \nBut one needs to go beyond not only just appointing Omar Suleiman but lifting the 30-year state of emergency . \nThat has to be lifted . \nA transformation , a political opening where parties can organize themes in preparation for the 2011 presidential elections , that 's just one step on a long road . \nKAYE : Wonderful insight . \nMarco Vicenzino , Thank you so much . \nMANN : Our extensive coverage continues . \nIs there a WikiLeaks angle in any of this ? \nAtika Shubert is live from London right after the break . \nWe are closely following events in Egypt as they unfold . \nLet 's go back live to Cairo right now were Amr Khalid is a well-known televangelist in the world . \nWe appreciate your time on this day . \nI want the start by getting your thoughts on what we 've been witnessing there in Egypt and what it means for Hosni Mubarak . \nAMR KHALILD , TELEVANGELIST : Let me tell you first that the Egyptian youth ten years ago nobody listened to them , no jobs for them . \nThey have no hope . \nThey have no dream in their life . \nSo what happened this week , they have a lot of problems . \nNo one respected them . \nIn '06 I asked the youth in the Middle East and in Egypt , please send me your dreams for your country for 20 years from now . \nCan you imagine , I got 700,000 dreams . \nI asked them , what are the priorities ? \nThey said , we need jobs , we need to work . \nThey want to work . \nThey want somebody to respect them . \nThis is the problem . \nThis is the situation . \nBut , at the same time I disagree about what some people going to do , this is not acceptable to do in our country . \nSo from CNN , I 'm giving you that I have an initiative . \nWe 'll start tomorrow , 50,000 of lawmakers , my organization in Egypt will go to keep and to protect all the banks , the hotels and museums in Egypt , to be with one image , we will go -- SESAY : Amr Khalid , let me jump in there . \nYou say you 're going to do your bit if you can to bring about peace on the streets . \nPresident Hosni Mubarak a short time ago introducing a vice president , Omar Suleiman . \nWhat effect will this have on these protests ? \nWill it go anyways towards calming them down ? \nKHALILD : Actually , I 'm not quite sure . \nI ca n't tell you now . \nWe are in a very bad situation . \nAnd I can tell you as you see from all these people . \nBut what I 'm going to tell you that if we did n't look for the future of our youth , their dreams , and we have to respect their dreams . \nThe problem is not only in Egypt . \nIt 's in all the Middle East it will be worse . \nI went to Yemen to establish a project to stop their extremists in Yemen . \nBut the local Yemeni youth told me , where are the jobs ? \nWe need to work . \nThis is what I 'm saying and what I 'm trying to do in my projects . \nAgain , we have an initiative and with the army in Egypt to say , with Amr Khalid tomorrow will be to protect our museums , banks , to keep our country . \nKHALILD : Amr Khalid , we have to leave it there . \nWe want to thank you for joining us . \nAmr Khalid saying he 'll play his part to protect Egypt 's important institutions and buildings . \nWe 'll try to do a little bit of digging to find out what that really means when it does come to pass , if it does come to path . \nHosni Mubarak , the president has just appointed a new vice president . \nWe 're standing by for that swearing-in ceremony . \nWe 're going to be right back after this . \nWe 're covering the unfolding events in Egypt , the upheaval there from every angle . \nHere 's an intriguing one , WikiLeaks . \nThe purloined State Department documents have revealed a lot about the world 's leaders and there 's an Egyptian angle to it , too . \nAtika Shubert joins us now from London . \nWhat did you see ? \nATIKA SHUBERT , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : As you know , there 's a quarter of a million diplomatic cables that WikiLeaks is sitting on . \nAs you can imagine there are dozens of Egyptian cables in there . \nThey really reveal the sort of complicated and contradictory relationship the United States has with Egypt . \nI want to bring up something I just found here which is a cable dating from 2007 that talks about presidential succession in Egypt . \nIt mentions Omar Suleiman , who is now , of course , just been appointed vice president . \nIt describes him as Mubarak 's consigliore , saying that it 's only been in the last few years that he stepped out of the shadows as the director of intelligence , has allowed himself to be photographed in meetings with foreign leaders . \nAnd that because of his military background , that analysts believe that he would at least have to figure in any sort of succession scenario . \nThe cable also points out that he is known to be extremely loyal to Mubarak . \nThe exact description is `` his loyalty to Mubarak seems rock solid . '' \nAnd they also point out that he could be attractive not only to the ruling apparatus but to the public at large as a reliable figure , because , quote , `` He is unlikely to harbor ambitions for another multi - decade presidency . '' \nSo that basically sums up what U.S. diplomats , at least in 2007 , what they were thinking of Omar Suleiman at the time . \nMANN : I do n't want to make too much of this , but consigliore is not a word that we use very often . \nI do n't speak Italian . \nThe only way I know that word is from the `` Godfather '' movies . \nAre they making a reference to mobsters by choosing that kind of title ? \nSHUBERT : Well , we 'd have to ask U.S. diplomats to find out . \nBut it certainly suggests his role as an adviser , giving advice to somebody who perhaps sees himself as something like a godfather to a nation , who sees himself as somebody who is basically holding the forces of chaos at bay and who really is trying to rule the country in the way that he sees as just and fair , even if apparently the public does not . \nMANN : Atika Shubert live in London , thanks very much . \nAnd so President Hosni Mubarak is under pressure from his own people there , demonstrators in the streets of his capital . \nHe has fired his cabinet but he 's now hired a vice president for first time in 30 years in power , a trusted figure within the regime , a man with a background in solving the president 's problems . \nWe 'll be back with more right after this . \n"}

{"id": "86", "time": "2011-01-28", "text": "A somber Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak recognized demonstrators ' concerns while asserting his government 's duty to protect the African nation 's security in a nationally televised speech early Saturday , which he punctuated by announcing that he had asked his government to resign . \nMubarak began the address , which started just after midnight , with a call for unity , saying , `` We all honestly should stand with each other for this country . '' \nStill , it was n't until the speech 's conclusion that he detailed a major step he had taken to begin addressing the crisis : asking for his current government 's resignation . \nThe president -- who has been in power for 30 years -- then said he would form a new team , with a refocused mission acknowledging a popular desire for economic reforms , starting Saturday . \n`` I will ask the new government to have clear and specific responsibilities to deal , in a calculated way , with the the vital next phase , '' Mubarak said , according to a translation of his remarks from Arabic . \nMubarak said earlier that he had heard , and understood , demonstrators ' pleas asking for the government to take more action to create jobs , lower prices and improve the plight of the poor . \n`` I know all these things ... that the people are asking -LRB- because -RRB- I 've never been separated from it . \nI work for it every day , '' he said . \n`` I 'll always be on the side of the poor .

'' \nHe told CNN : `` For us what was important , we needed to enforce the law -LRB- and -RRB- at the same time , we had to exercise the utmost restraint , and try to address whatever legitimate grievances these people on the streets had . '' \n`` I hope that in a number of countries , they will be able to do the same . '' \nAsked to offer advice to Mubarak , the Thai PM said : `` He should just respect the key principles of governance , respect the wishes of the people , and at the same time do his duties . '' \nThailand 's Red Shirt protesters took to the streets to call for the return of former PM Thaksin Shinawatra , who was ousted in a coup in 2006 . \nAs the demonstrations raged , Abhisit 's government imposed a state of emergency , putting the military in charge of security . \nIt was lifted in December . \nAbhisit has pledged to hold fresh elections before the end of this year . \n"}

{"id": "107", "time": "2011-01-28", "text": "January 28 , 2011 | By Bryony Jones Members of the Muslim Brotherhood movement shout slogans in Amman , Jordan on Friday after weekly prayers . \nThe Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt this week urged its followers to protest after Friday prayers -- the first time in the latest wave of unrest the group has made such a call . \nWhat is the Muslim Brotherhood ? \nThe Muslim Brotherhood is a religious and political group founded on the belief that Islam is not simply a religion , but a way of life . \nIt advocates a move away from secularism , and a return to the rules of the Quran as a basis for healthy families , communities , and states . \nThe movement officially rejects the use of violent means to secure its goals . \nHowever , offshoots of the group have been linked to attacks in the past , and critics blame the Brotherhood for sparking troubles elsewhere in the Middle East . \nMany consider it the forerunner of modern militant Islamism . \nThe Muslim Brotherhood has been part of the political scene in Egypt for more than 80 years . \nIt was formed there by Hassan al-Banna in 1928 . \nTeacher Al-Banna and his followers were initially united by a desire to oust the British from control in Egypt , and to rid their country of what they saw as `` corrupting '' Western influences . \nIn its early years , the group concentrated on religion , education and social services , but as its membership grew , it moved into the political sphere , organizing protests against the Egyptian government . \nIn the 1940s , an armed wing of the Brotherhood was blamed for a string of violent acts , including the assassination of Egyptian Prime Minister Mahmud Fahmi al-Nuqrashi in 1948 -- shortly after he had ordered the dissolution of the MB . \nAl-Banna himself was assassinated soon afterwards -- his supporters claimed he had been killed on the wishes of the government . \nThe movement went underground in the 1950s , and decades of oppression by successive Egyptian rulers led many of the Brotherhood 's members to flee abroad , while others were jailed . \nThe MB grew throughout the 1980s as part of a general growth of interest in Islam , and the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 saw a spike in membership . \nWhy is it important in Egypt ? \nThe Brotherhood is the oldest and largest opposition group in Egypt . \nHowever , it is illegal under Egyptian law , which bans all parties based on religion . \nBecause of this , its members contest elections as independents . \nUntil last year 's polls , the party had 88 seats in the country 's legislature . \nBut following a decision to boycott the election because of voting irregularities , its parliamentary influence was wiped out . \nThe Brotherhood has widespread support among Egypt 's middle classes , and its members control many of the country 's professional organizations . \nHow influential is the Brotherhood elsewhere ? \nThere are branches of the Muslim Brotherhood in countries across the Middle East and North and East Africa , including Sudan , Syria and Saudi Arabia . \nThere is also a branch in the U.S. Its offshoots outside Egypt are markedly more conservative in their views : The Kuwaiti branch is said to oppose the right of women to vote . \nSayyid Qutb , a member of the Muslim Brotherhood in the 1950s and 1960s , developed the doctrine of jihad , and the radical group Hamas is believed to be an offshoot of the Palestinian Muslim Brotherhood . \n"}

'' \nThat word , yelled out in Arabic , reverberated Friday along the banks of the Nile River in Cairo -- as well as in the port city of Alexandria , near the canal in Suez , and other pockets of Egypt . \nMany demonstrators voicing their desire for a new government and new political future remained on the streets well into Saturday morning , defying a curfew and revelling in a historic day in a nation whose history dates back millennia . \nBy early Saturday , police were nowhere to be seen in the capital of Cairo , with military forces deployed on streets all around the nation for the first time in more than three decades . \nThey were ordered out by President Hosni Mubarak , whom many demonstrators were urging to step down or , at least , institute dramatic economic and political reforms . \n`` We want -LRB- Mubarek -RRB- to leave , '' said Ahmed , whose last name was withheld to protect his identity . \n`` His time is over , '' the 19-year-old law student said early Saturday from Raml Square in central Alexandria . \nEgypt 's ruling party headquarters on fire Police fire tear gas at protesters Suez crowds confront riot police Mubarak has been in power for 30 years , during which time Egypt has established itself as one of the most important powers in the region and a strong ally of the United States . \nAt the same time , the long-time ruler and his regime had a reputation for restricting freedoms and staunchly holding onto power . \nResistance in the past had often been stifled by either political manuevering or the police , members of which were out in full force this week . \nBut rarely have they met an opposition force as large , or as apparently determined . \n`` Police have always been violent , but we have n't seen it this way , '' Sarah Sirgany , a reporter for Daily News Egypt who has been posting regular developments on Twitter , told CNN 's Piers Morgan . \n`` We have n't seen this many people on the streets at the same time . '' \nVideo footage from Friday showed throngs of protesters charging down a bridge over the Nile River in Cairo , overrunning police trucks that fired off tear gas with minimal effect . \nElsewhere , demonstrators torched and ransacked the headquarters of Mubarak 's ruling National Democratic Party . \nWhen protesters circled the Ministry of Information in Cairo on Friday , they were greeted by police , who responded with sharp cracks of gunfire . \nIt 's not clear whether police shot at protesters or into the air , whether their bullets were rubber or steel , whether anyone was wounded or killed . \nThere were many other reports of run-ins , and the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights reporting early Friday that the government had arrested more than 1,000 people , including political opposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei . \nMohammed Mansour , a resident of the Shubra neighborhood of Cairo , said that he and fellow demonstrators had been `` beaten and assaulted by police '' since Monday , when the popular unrest began . \nContinuing to fight Friday , he said that his group had beaten back police , who retreated . \nLater he claimed , protesters set fire to three police stations and about 20 police cars . \n`` We went out today and we were ready to die , so our children can live in dignity , '' said Mansour . \nProtesters ' interactions with Egypt 's military -- members of an army that is widely respected in Egypt -- were far more friendly . \nIn Cairo and Alexandria , many protesters greeted troops with embraces and cheers , some even shaking hands with soldiers . \nMansour , the Cairo resident , said he and fellow demonstrators celebrated when they saw troops roll into town , and they were not alone . \n`` It means we are victorious , '' he said . \n`` If the army comes out , that means the government ... is no longer in control . '' \nIn the wee hours of Saturday , with the curfew ostensibly in effect , people continued to come up to friendly army troops , greeting them and posing for pictures by tanks . \nSome military personnel were stationed outside burned out police stations , but did little to prevent people from going into them and coming out with chairs , tables and various valuables . \nThe army was n't the only side exercising restraint . \nThe Muslim Brotherhood sent its followers onto the streets after Friday prayers , the first time Egypt 's large and venerable -- but illegal -- Islamic opposition called for protest during this round of demonstrations . \nAnd when younger Muslim Brotherhood protesters seemed ready to hurl rocks at the police in Alexandria , Egypt 's second-largest city , older men put their arms around their shoulders , calming them down . \nJust after midnight Saturday , Mubarak gave a speech defending and explaining the government 's response to the protests while saying that he 'd soon form a new government mindful of the demonstrators ' demands for policy changes . \nStill that did n't appease many on the streets , who vowed to continue demonstrating again against what they felt was an unjust ruling government that needed a fresh start -- without Mubarak . \n`` We are one of the richest Arab countries , and we want to live , '' said a 20-year-old student named Mohammed , whose last name was withheld to protect his identity , from Alexandria . \n`` Let a new government form , but if we do n't get what we ask for , we will go back to the streets again and again . '' \nAnother protester in Alexandria , an 18-year-old taxi driver named Yousef , did n't even think the entrenched Egyptian ruler deserved even that much of a chance . \nHe said Egyptians should press on with their protests , following the lead of their fellow African nation Tunisia . \nThere , President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali left the country after 23 years in power following weeks of demonstrations against his rule . \nThe new government , under Prime Minister Mohamed Ghannouchi , announced new freedoms and promised to institute numerous democratic-minded reforms . \n`` They kept protesting until he fled the country , '' Yousef said of Tunisia . \n`` We will do more and more , we will continue our demonstrations , and we will do 3,000 times more of what the Tunisians did .

'' Combined Systems Inc. also has sold tear gas to Tunisia and Israel Some Twitter users demand why U.S.-made weapons are being used against protesters -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A thick pall of chemical smoke hung over a crowd in Cairo on Friday afternoon . \nPeople ran , covering their noses and mouths to escape yet another volley of tear gas . \nThe same scene was being played out elsewhere in Cairo , in Alexandria and Suez . \nAnd several weeks back , Tunisian police used tear gas to try to quell protests there . \nIt is one of the most common ways to used to disperse protests -- but not everyone runs . \nIn both Tunisia and Egypt , some protesters stopped to pick up canisters , and posted photographs online . \nA few inches long , blue and silver , they include warning labels and then a set of initials : CSI , followed by `` Made in the U.S.A. '' The photograph posted in Tunisia was of a 40 mm riot CS smoke projectile , made by a company called Combined Systems Inc. , which describes itself as a `` tactical weapons company '' and is based in Jamestown , Pennsylvania . \nCSI 's website describes the projectile as `` a launched burning extended-range single projectile round that dispenses smoke or chemical agents via rapid burning . \nUsed effectively during riots at safe stand-off distances to disperse groups or deny areas . '' \nIts warning label reads : `` Danger : Do not fire directly at person -LRB- s -RRB- . \nSevere injury or death may result . '' \nThat warning is apparently not always followed . \nLucas Mebrouk Dolega died in Tunisia on January 17 , three days after being hit by a tear gas grenade at close range . \nThe 32-year-old was a photographer for the European PressPhoto Agency . \nOn Thursday , a similar picture was posted on Twitter by a someone in Egypt , only this time it was of a grenade , not a canister . \nIt , too , was made by CSI . \nThe grenade appears to be an `` Outdoor 52 Series Large Grenade '' that `` discharges a high volume of smoke and chemical agent through multiple emission ports . \nSpecifically for outdoor use , '' the website says . \nCSI 's website -LRB- www.less-lethal.com -RRB- bills the company as the `` premier engineering , manufacturing and supply company of tactical munitions and crowd control devices globally to armed forces , law enforcement , corrections and homeland security agencies . '' \nClients include the U.S. Army , U.S. Customs and Border Patrol , and the U.S. Department of State , as well as Rafael Advanced Defense Systems and Israeli Military Industries -- both of which are weapons companies based in Israel . \nOn January 1 , Jawaher Abu Rahmah died in the West Bank during a weekly protest against a security barrier being built in Bilin . \nIsrael considers the protests violent and illegal . \nRahmah died of severe asphyxiation and cardiac arrest after Israeli soldiers fired tear gas canisters into the crowd . \nIn April 2009 , Rahmah 's brother was killed participating in the same weekly protest when a tear gas canister struck him directly in the chest . \nA spokesman for CSI says the company is operating well within the law by selling tear gas to countries like Tunisia and Egypt . \nAccording to the Chemical Weapons Convention , riot control agents are not considered chemical weapons unless used during a time of war . \nThis means that it 's perfectly legal to manufacture and sell tear gas , so long as countries do n't stockpile a large amount of the chemical compounds . \nThe spokesman declined to say how much tear gas CSI had sold to countries in northern Africa , but said it is a small company . \nHe also said CSI could not control how its products are used once sold . \nSocial media reaction to the `` Made in the U.S.A. '' label on the canisters was scathing , with some suggesting it meant the U.S. government itself was somehow involved in suppressing the protests . \nSome Twitter users demanded to know `` why so many weapons used against Egyptian protesters read ` made in the USA ' . '' \nOthers advised `` Maybe U.S. weapons manufacturers should stop printing `` made in USA '' on their weapons especially the ones we send to brutal autocrats . '' \nWhether CSI is operating within the law has n't stopped protestors from voicing their dissatisfaction with the company . \nAfter Rahmah died in Israel , demonstrators gathered outside Point Lookout Capital Partners ' Manhattan offices . \nPoint Lookout owns a majority interest in CSI . \nThe protesting group -- the New York Campaign for the Boycott of Israel -- demanded that CSI stop providing tear gas that could be used on Palestinians by Israeli forces . \nIsraeli authorities are still investigating Jawaher Abu Rahmah 's death . \nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , there are several compounds that are considered to be riot-control agents . \nTwo of the most common are chloroacetophenone -LRB- CN -RRB- and chlorobenzylidene malononitrile -LRB- CS -RRB- . \nOthers include chloropicrin -LRB- PS -RRB- , bromobenzylcyanide -LRB- CA -RRB- , and dibenzoxazepine -LRB- CR -RRB- . \nRiot control agents temporarily disable those affected by causing irritation to the eyes , mouth , throat , lungs , and skin . \nLong-lasting exposure to these compounds can cause blindness and chemical burning of the throat and lungs resulting in death , as well as respiratory failure , which can also result in death . \n"}

The liberal movement continues to be fragmented , from the traditional opposition parties , to students ' movements , to the upper-middle-class intelligentsia , to the new National Association of Change , the vehicle associated with Dr. Mohamed El-Baradei . \nArguably , the liberal movement benefits from the nationalist , inclusive slogans of the demonstrations which shunned appeals to Islam and Christianity in favor of Egyptianism . \nBut the liberal movement so far lacks the institutional structure required to evolve into a viable , immediate alternative to the regime . \nThis unpreparedness is a paramount deficiency in a country with colossal economic challenges such as Egypt 's . \nAs Egypt heads toward a presidential election in September , two things will shape its political landscape . \nOne is the interaction amongst the regime , political Islam , and the liberal movement ; the other is the relationship within the regime itself -- between the military and security establishment on the one hand and Egypt 's economic power centers on the other . \nIt is unlikely that the situation in Egypt will descend into chaos . \nThe military and security establishment can enforce stability , provided we do not see major unrest within the country 's middle class . \nBut these expressions of anger intensify the uncertainty surrounding Egypt 's future -- especially in the period post-Mubarak , who is approaching his mid-80s . \nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tarek Osman . \n"}

'' \nPlus there 's a thriving black market that often drives up the prices poor households are paying for foodstuffs , Sabra said . \nMeanwhile the bigger problem lies not in just prices , but in the fact that when citizens are unhappy , they have little opportunity for political recourse . \n`` In the U.S. if you 're unhappy about who you 've deputized , you vote them out in the next election , '' Sabra said . \n`` It does n't work that way in Tunisia or Egypt .

'' \nPersonally , it is definitely too late for Mubarak to provide any say in Egypt 's future . \nIf he shows his face in public now , he is likely to be killed . \nIt is amazing how everyone is always so critical of the USA . \nUSA is just like other governments in the world ; they usually will only get involved if there is a benefit to themselves . \nThis is usually the way human nature works . \nWhen we are the wealthy , we want to hold on to our wealth . \nThis is the same for the USA as well as it is the same for Hosni Mubarak . \nThe only difference is that the USA has a government composed of different branches in order for the people to speak up and prevent a dictatorship for decades on end . \nIn the news it mentioned that the USA has gone through eight presidents while Egypt has only seen one individual . \nYes in the ideal world DEMOCRACY is the ideal , but reality is that a government must make executive decisions for the whole and it is impossible for the government to make everyone happy at the same time . \nAlthough , the USA has funded Israel it has also provided foreign aid to many other countries including Egypt 's billion dollars a year . \nWe may preach democracy for Egypt and one of these days , Egypt as well as the USA will have a 100 % democratic country . \nUntil then we should be praying for the people who are unable to leave their homes because of fear and pray that the current situation improves quickly not only in Egypt but around the world . \nThe innocent civilians that are caught up in these protests need our support for a better outcome . \nI admire your depth of analysis . \nPlease go a little more south to Ethiopia , where ethnic apartheid is being practiced . \nWe have the worst dictator on the planet . \nMubarak 's dictatorship fades in the eyes of Meles Zenawi , who is cruel and does n't blink an eye before he orders the slaughter of more than 200 people when he lost the election in 2005 , more than 100,000 and the entire opposition was arrested . \nThe US says nothing as usual . \nWhat happens in Egypt will ultimately happen elsewhere where `` US friendly distatorships '' are allowed to stay in power supported by successive US governments . \nBy the way , be it democratic or republican , the world sees no change in the approach used by the US government , it is always about US or Israeli interest , but not about the suffering of the masses in those opressed countries . \nAt last , I think Mubarak may have got some advice from our dictator , `` disturb the peaceful demonstration by using security thugs , and then stop demonstration `` in the interest of safety and security '' . \nALL DICTATORS WILL FALL . \nI watch in pain images on the screen . \nIs there any doubt that men on horses and camels are paid by the Egyptian government ? \nThese are not normal civilians . \nYes , you can see carts pulled by horses in Cairo . \nBut , you never see men riding horses in Cairo . \nThese are government paid thugs . \nMy father worked with the Egyptian military during Nasser 's time . \nFollowing the 1967 defeat , my father saw peple packed in trucks before the president announced his intent to resign . \nThe crowds were supposed to cry for him to stay . \nAnd , so they did and he stayed . \nMoubarak is following in the foot steps of those leaders . \nEverything is rigged , even the images he displays to the world . \nIt is quiet obvious he will not step down on his own accord -LRB- even if he gave the required `` lip service '' . \nYou only need to ask yourself `` what kind of person would through molotov fire at his own people ?

'' \nObama 's remarks , delivered from State Dining Room , were the strongest yet from the United States . \n`` There must be reform , '' he said , `` political , social and economic reforms that meet the aspirations of the Egyptian people . \n`` In the absence of these reforms , '' he said , `` grievances have built up over time . \n`` The United States will continue to stand up for the rights of the Egyptian people and work with their government in pursuit of a future that is more just , more free and more hopeful , '' he concluded . \nIn his remarks , Mubarak was clear that he had no intentions of stepping down -- yet his resignation is what the protesters are demanding . \nAnd privately , U.S. officials fear that Mubarak may be in over his head as protests against his 30-year rule showed no signs of ending . \nA senior administration official said the White House saw Mubarak 's address as `` hardly conciliatory and highly disappointing , but what did you expect ? '' \nIt 's clear , the official said -- speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter -- that Mubarak believes he can ride this out , `` and this time , we 're not so sure that is the right assumption .

'' \nLongtime Egypt watchers tried to keep their hopes low , expecting the same disappointing results as before . \nNow , four days into an uprising in the Arab world 's most populous country , the beating heart of its media culture , and the historical strategic leader of the region , it 's no longer possible to argue that Egypt is a stable country . \nThe situation is changing rapidly , but what we know is this : The country is virtually cut off from the outside world . \nEgyptians from across the social and geographical spectrum -- from poor , jobless young men along the Suez Canal to upper-class women in posh Cairo suburbs to workers in the teeming Nile Delta -- are in an uproar . \nThe ruling National Democratic Party 's headquarters has been set on fire . \nThe army has sent troops and armored vehicles into the streets to enforce a curfew as defiant demonstrators torch police stations and vehicles . \nU.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , speaking slowly and carefully to avoid making a mistake at a sensitive moment , urged the Egyptian government Friday to allow its people to protest peacefully . \nBut , she added , `` We want to partner with the Egyptian people and their government '' and called on Mubarak to make reforms . \nAll week , the U.S. message has been largely consistent : Egypt is a key ally , both sides should refrain from violence and the government should respect the legitimate grievances of the Egyptian people . \n"}

'' \nExperienced observers say it 's the most most significant challenge to his rule yet . \nIt 's far from clear , however , that the demonstrators have the support or the coordination to bring down the man critics have called Egypt 's last pharaoh . \n`` He 's been in power a very long time , and he is very wily , '' said Juan Cole , a Middle East historian at the University of Michigan . \n`` He 's developed all kinds of techiniques for dealing with opponents that have proven relatively successful . '' \nBut longtime observers of the region say the stability Mubarak has purchased has come at the cost of entrenched poverty and repression in the Arab world 's most populous nation . \n`` Egypt is a broken country , '' Fawaz Gerges , a professor of Middle Eastern relations at the London School of Economics , told CNN . \n`` It used to be the jewel of the Middle East . \nIt 's the capital of its cultural production . '' \nBut now , Gerges said , `` Egyptians have no outlets . \nThey do n't feel that they have a sense of hope for the future . '' \nWho would fill Egypt 's power void ? \nEgypt protester : My life is in danger Mubarak was a Soviet-trained pilot who was chief of staff of Egypt 's air force during the 1973 Mideast war . \nThe early success of Egyptian pilots against Israel made him a national hero , and then-President Anwar Sadat made him vice president in 1975 . \nSix years later , Sadat died in a hail of gunfire at a military parade , killed by Islamic militants from within the army 's own ranks after he took the dramatic step of making peace with Israel . \nUpon assuming office , one of Mubarak 's first acts was to declare a state of emergency that allowed barred unauthorized assembly , restricted freedom of speech and allowed police to jail people indefinitely . \nHe has made extensive use of those powers in the ensuing decades . \nThe Egyptian army put down riots by disgruntled police officers in 1986 , and he threw an estimated 30,000 people in jail when jihadists carried out a string of attacks on tourists . \n`` He pretty much wiped them out , '' Cole said . \n`` It 's not an accident that they were in Afghanistan instead of Egypt . '' \nAnd the government has also penetrated opposition movements so thoroughly that `` If five people sit down to plot something , the fifth person writes a report to Hosni Mubarak about it , '' he said . \nThe result is `` a regime that has very little legitimacy , but presents itself as something there 's no point in trying to change , '' said Nathan Brown , a professor of Middle Eastern politics at George Washington University in Washington . \nBut Brown said the January 14 overthrow of Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali , who fled to Saudi Arabia after 23 years in power , has changed the thinking of many in the region . \n`` I think what the events in Tunisia did was take that sense that nothing could ever change and lead a few people to question it , '' he said . \nMubarak has headed off a similar movement before , in 2005 , when Egyptians mounted large-scale protests to demand fundamental and widespread reform . \nHe intimidated the leaders of the officially banned but tolerated Muslim Brotherhood , harassed middle-class demonstrators and managed to pick off the leadership of those protests , Brown said . \nBut the current movement `` has no real leadership , so it ca n't be decapitated the same way , '' he said . \n`` If Mubarak decided tomorrow , ` I 'll sit down and engage with you , ' it 's not clear who that ` you ' is . '' \nMubarak won four terms as president in elections that were considered formalities . \nHis fifth , in 2005 , was Egypt 's first multi-party presidential vote , but it was widely criticized as a `` sham , '' Cole said . \nEgyptians have no outlets . \nThey do n't feel that they have a sense of hope for the future -- Fawaz Gerges , London School of Economics professor Meanwhile , the country 's economy stagnated for the first 20 years of his rule . \nDevelopment has picked up in the past decade , fueled by a move away from state control and by billions in tourist dollars , but its gains have been `` very unevenly distributed . '' \nAbout 40 percent of Egyptians currently live in poverty , Gerges said . \nThe aging autocrat has escaped at least two assassination attempts , including a close call in 1995 when Islamic militants opened fire on his motorcade at a pan-African conference in Ethiopia . \nAnd in recent years , he has had several bouts of illness but has never picked a vice president . \nHe is widely believed to have anointed his son Gamal as his successor , but no formal announcement has been made . \nIn 2003 , he collapsed while delivering a televised speech to the Egyptian parliament -- returning later to blame his illness on the flu . \nHe had back surgery in Germany in 2004 , returning in 2010 to have his gall bladder removed . \nHe has largely withdrawn from public view in recent years and has not addressed his country during the current crisis , Brown said . \nHis situation is being closely watched overseas , particularly in the United States . \nIn the past decade , Egypt has been major player in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks , and it contributed troops to the U.S.-led coalition that drove Iraq out of Kuwait in 1991 . \nIt gets about $ 1.3 billion in military aid from Washington every year , second only to Israel , and has received nearly $ 30 billion in economic aid since 1975 , according to State Department figures . \nBut it opposed the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 -- and while sticking with Camp David , Egypt 's ties with Israel amount to a `` cold peace , '' Cole said . \nPresident Barack Obama noted Thursday that Mubarak has been `` very helpful on a range of tough issues , '' but he said he has pushed the Egyptian leader to take steps toward reform . \n`` You can see these pent-up frustrations that are being displayed on the streets , '' Obama said . \nHe urged the Egyptian government to avoid resorting to violence to put down the demonstrations , adding , `` I think it 's very important that people have mechanisms in order to express legitimate grievances . '' \nBrown said Mubarak probably has to endorse some political form to survive . \nBut he will have to do it `` extremely carefully , so it 's not seen as a desperate measure of last resort . '' \nCole said Mubarak could bow to one of the protesters ' demands and lift the state of emergency . \n`` Egypt does have a fairly liberal constitution and it does enshrine a lot of rights in it , '' he said . \n`` But it 's just a piece of paper . \nIt 's sidestepped by the emergency . '' \nIf lifted , `` The judges and the courts in Egypt are very feisty , and they will take on the government . '' \nHe could also hold a free and fair presidential election this year , `` but it 's asking a lot , '' Cole said . \nBut Gerges said the Middle East has seen `` the barrier of fear '' removed since the events in Tunisia . \n`` Arabs really no longer feel terrified of the security apparatus , regardless of whether Mubarak remains or goes , '' he said . \n`` We 're going to have a new era of politics .

'' \nSpeaking to CNN about the recent demonstrations that have occurred , to varying extent , in Algeria , Egypt and Tunisia in northern Africa , and Yemen on the Arabian Peninsula , Hokayem said the protesters were also standing up `` against a high level of police brutality . '' \n`` Fundamentally it 's a question of dignity . \nPeople 's dignity has been under assault for decades , '' he said . \nJuan Cole , a Middle East historian at the University of Michigan and a blogger , put it this way : `` There 's a feeling a lot of people are being left behind . '' \nThe protesters are driven by economic frustrations , `` discontent with authoritarian character of the regime , '' and the `` feeling that there 's no real representation '' -- although to different degrees in each nation , Cole said . \nAcross all four countries , the protest movements are `` largely driven by young people '' and include a `` high proportion of the educated middle class , '' he said . \nThere 's `` a feeling amongst that middle class that they 're not being given the opportunities in life that their degrees warrant -- what historians would call a ` blocked elite . ' '' \nThe worldwide economic crisis helped trigger the demonstrations by adding to economic pressures at home , and showing up in things like petroleum and food prices , Cole said . \nBut there are differences among the protest movements as well . \nIn Egypt , `` the state probably has done more to protect people '' from rising food prices by offering subsidies , Cole said . \nThe Egyptian economy was stagnant for decades , but in the past 10 years started to grow -- creating bigger differences between rich and poor , Cole said . \n`` And I think some of the protest is over the ways in which the labor movements have gotten left behind and have n't shared in the economic growth '' in that country , he said . \nEgypt cracks down on protesters Algerian forces clash with protesters In Algeria , where protests have been relatively small , the demonstrations `` look to me like an after-effect of the civil war that Algeria had between the fundamentalists and the secular generalists , '' Cole added . \nYemen has also faced great internal strife , which serves as a background to the wave of protests , he said . \nThe dire poverty in Yemen has also left questions about how many people have access to water , he said . \n`` It 's a deeply poverty-stricken country which is getting worse off . \n... People are desperate there . '' \nIn Tunisia , the government was run by an especially small clique , `` a kind of mafia state , '' which people are railing against , Cole said . \n`` The tightness of that clique and the way in which it dominated the economy is beyond anything you see elsewhere . \nPeople just were n't being let into the system to benefit . '' \nHokayem said that `` the key differences have to do with the makeup of these societies . '' \nFor example , `` Egypt is more diverse , a much bigger country , '' while Tunisia has a `` pretty homogeneous population . '' \nAlso , the military plays a different role in the different societies , he said . \nIn Tunisia , it is `` small and underfunded '' and not a major instrument of power , unlike in Egypt , where the military is a much bigger player , he said . \nBut while the context for each protest movement may be unique , `` at the end of the day , the real driver is psychology , '' Hokayem said . \nHe noted two more key similarities among the protest movements : `` The Islamists do n't seem to be on the forefront in any of those countries , '' he said . \n`` Up to now , it has been a mix of separate leftist and moderate Islamic movements . '' \nAnd unlike other protests seen in the Arab world in recent years , the protests are n't against the West -- nor do they seem inspired by the West . \n`` The West is irrelevant in a way , '' he said . \nGrievances at home `` are driving all of this .

'' \nVietor added that Obama will get even more on the latest intelligence on Friday during his Presidential Daily Briefing , which is focused each day on sensitive material dealing with pressing national security issues . \nAsked if there have been any direct telephone calls between Obama and Mubarak , Vietor said , `` The president has not called President Mubarak , but there is daily contact between the U.S. and Egyptian governments through various channels , including the embassies and other organizations in which President Obama 's messages and concerns are relayed . '' \nThe president publicly expressed some of those concerns about Mubarak 's reaction to the protests on Wednesday , during a Q&A session moderated by You Tube in which Obama took questions from the general public . \n`` My main hope right now is , is that violence is not the answer in solving these problems in Egypt , so the government has to be careful about not resorting to violence , and the people on the streets have to be careful about not resorting to violence , '' Obama said . \n`` And I think that it is very important that people have mechanisms in order to express legitimate grievances . '' \nObama and top officials in his administration are in the awkward position of deciding how closely to stand with the repressive Mubarak , who has been in power for 30 years and is now cracking down on protesters and cutting off social media . \n`` As I said in my State of the Union speech , there are certain core values that we believe in as Americans that we believe are universal : freedom of speech , freedom of expression , people being able to use social networking or any other mechanisms to communicate with each other and express their concerns , '' Obama said . \n`` And that I think is no less true in the Arab world than it is here in the United States . '' \nIt 's hard to overstate how pivotal Mubarak has been to the U.S. in bringing stability to the region over the years , including help to the Obama administration on building international support to stop Iran 's nuclear ambitions as well as trying to bring together the Israelis and Palestinians in efforts to forge Mideast peace . \nAll of that makes this a tough balancing act for Obama . \n`` Let me say , first of all , that Egypt has been an ally of ours on a lot of critical issues , '' Obama said during the You Tube session . \n`` They made peace with Israel . \nPresident Mubarak has been very helpful on a range of tough issues in the Middle East . \nBut I 've always said to him that making sure that they are moving forward on reform - political reform , economic reform - is absolutely critical to the long-term well-being of Egypt . \nAnd you can see these pent-up frustrations that are being displayed on the streets . \nWhen the protests first sprung up earlier in the week , White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs was twice asked if the White House still backed Mubarak directly , and he twice fell back on quotes declaring that Egypt in general is an ally of the U.S. Vice President Joe Biden is also trying to walk that same fine line , refusing to call the Egyptian leader a dictator in an interview with PBS on Thursday , while also noting that Mubarak needs to make changes to his government and let his people taste freedom . \nAsked specifically by Jim Lehrer if it is time for Mubarak to `` stand aside , '' Biden said , `` No I think the time has come for President Mubarak to move in the direction to be more responsive to some of the needs of the people out there . '' \nBiden added the protesters are `` middle class folks who are looking for a little more access a little more opportunity and the two things we 've been saying Jim is that violence is n't appropriate and people have the right to protest and so we think that I hope I think that Mubarak president Mubarak will is going to respond to the legitimate concerns that are being raised .

'' \nThe recent pro-democracy mass protests around the Arab world -- in places like Tunisia , Yemen and Egypt -- reflect the beginnings of a `` democracy Renaissance , '' launched by the millions of citizens within these countries that have been ruled for decades by ruthless autocrats and soft dictators . \nThe recent `` Jasmine Revolution '' in Tunisia began with the desperate act of a young unemployed man who set himself on fire . \nAnd that passionate fire would ultimately rage against the Tunisian government machine until its long-serving president would be forced into exile two weeks ago . \nThe young man was 26-year-old Mohammed Bouazizi , an unemployed fruit stand owner who became distraught when a policewoman confiscated his unlicensed produce stand . \nHe died from his burns . \nFollowing suit , several other unemployed youth around the country tried to commit suicide , and subsequent mass protests would soon topple the 23-year reign of Tunisia 's strongman , 74-year-old Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali . \nLong-standing autocratic rule within the Arab world shows a `` depressingly familiar pattern '' in terms of regional suppression of democracy , notes Egyptian-American writer Mona Eltahawy , in a recent Washington Post opinion piece . \nLibyan leader Moammar Gaddafi , 68 years old , has been in power since 1969 ; Yemen 's Ali Abdullah Saleh -LRB- 64 -RRB- has ruled since 1978 and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak -LRB- 82 -RRB- since 1981 . \nEltahawy wrote that these dinosaur political figures are `` not so much fathers as grandfathers of their nations , these autocrats clinging to office -- and are increasingly out of touch with their young populaces . '' \nMuch larger than Tunisia , the nation of Egypt is home to some 80 million people -- with Mubarak as its not-so-democratic leader since the assassination of Anwar Sadat in 1981 . \nFrom creating a virtual police state to promoting censorship by placing all media under state control , Hosni Mubarak has spent the better part of 30 years strengthening his autocratic rule , while millions of young Egyptians remain hungry and unemployed . \nOver time , his regime has needlessly tried to silence bloggers , imprisoned prominent pro-democracy activists such as Saad Eddin Ibrahim , and during these most recent mass protests even placed 2005 Nobel Peace Prize co-winner -LRB- and political opposition leader -RRB- Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei under house arrest . \n"}

'' \nObama 's remarks , delivered from State Dining Room , were the strongest yet from the United States . \n`` There must be reform , '' he said , `` political , social and economic reforms that meet the aspirations of the Egyptian people . \nGibbs : Violence not the answer in Egypt Police van slams into protester Suez crowds confront riot police Who would fill Egypt 's power void ? \n`` In the absence of these reforms , '' he said , `` grievances have built up over time . \n`` The United States will continue to stand up for the rights of the Egyptian people and work with their government in pursuit of a future that is more just , more free and more hopeful , '' he concluded . \nIn his remarks , Mubarak was clear that he had no intentions of stepping down -- yet his resignation is what the protesters are demanding . \nAnd privately , U.S. officials fear that Mubarak may be in over his head as protests against his 30-year rule showed no signs of ending . \nA senior administration official said the White House saw Mubarak 's address as `` hardly conciliatory and highly disappointing , but what did you expect ? '' \nIt 's clear , the official said -- speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter -- that Mubarak believes he can ride this out , `` and this time , we 're not so sure that is the right assumption . '' \nAdministration officials had hoped Mubarak would promise an immediate and open dialogue , the official said . \nBefore the speech , senior U.S. officials had similar thoughts , worrying that the Egyptian government may not realize all it is up against or what the protesters are saying . \nMubarak , they said , has two choices : to embrace meaningful reforms or to continue the crackdown . \nThe United States is being very careful not to be too tough on the Egyptian leader directly , the senior officials said , because they fear that might drive the government into a survivalist mentality , causing a further crackdown . \nThe officials said conversations with the Egyptian government are taking place across the U.S. administration , including with U.S. Ambassador to Egypt Margaret Scobey , who has participated in several videoconferences with Washington during the day . \nA senior State Department official said , `` our initial impression is that he emphasized security far more than reform . '' \n`` We 'll see what the implications for the government reshuffle are , but he was not particularly forthcoming in the speech , '' said the official , who could n't speak on the record because of the sensitivity of the situation . \nEarlier , White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said the administration is `` very concerned '' about the situation in Egypt , adding that at risk could be economic and military aid from the United States . \n`` This is a situation that will be solved by the people of Egypt , '' Gibbs said . \n`` We are watching very closely the actions of the government , the police and all of those in the military . '' \nThe United States will review its `` assistance posture '' to Egypt based on events that take place in the coming days , he said . \nGibbs declined to elaborate how the United States might alter relations with a key ally in the region but urged restraint as massive demonstrations have resulted in widespread property damage , including at the offices of Egypt 's ruling party . \nThat building was burned and ransacked by protesters in Cairo on Friday , Nile TV reported . \nA CNN witness saw the building ablaze . \nGibbs said the collective consequences of the government 's actions will be the subject of a review in determining whether the U.S. will alter assistance toward Egypt . \n`` Within that review is military '' assistance , Gibbs said . \nEgypt receives about $ 1.3 billion in military aid from Washington every year , second only to Israel , and has received nearly $ 30 billion in economic aid since 1975 , according to State Department figures . \n`` The die is cast , '' said Leslie H. Gelb , the president emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations . \n`` The administration has made clear that it leans toward the demonstrators . '' \nGibbs said , `` we 've reach a point where the grievances of the people have to be addressed through concrete reforms '' but would not elaborate on the potential fallout if the Mubarak government -- considered a strategic ally in the region -- does not survive the protests . \n`` We do n't know who these people are or if they are at all capable of putting a government together , '' Gelb said , cautioning of a power vacuum left by the possible collapse of the three-decade-old government . \nOften considered a crucial power broker in the Middle East , Egypt has played major roles in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and in controlling the Suez Canal , a strategic passageway for trade across the region . \nEarlier Friday , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called on Egypt 's government `` to allow peaceful protests and reverse the unprecedented steps it has taken to cut off communications . '' \n`` We are deeply concerned about the use of violence by Egyptian police and security forces against protesters , and we call on the Egyptian government to do everything within its power to restrain its security forces , '' Clinton said Friday , referring to the unfolding crisis in several Egyptian cities where tens of thousands of demonstrators clashed with state security forces . \n`` At the same time , protesters should also refrain from violence and express themselves peacefully , '' she said . \n`` As a partner , we strongly believe that the Egyptian government needs to engage with the Egyptian people immediately , '' Clinton said . \n`` They need to view civil society as their partner , not a threat . '' \nServers of Egypt 's main internet provider were down early Friday , including servers for the Egyptian government 's sites and for the U.S. Embassy in Cairo . \nEarly Friday , Gibbs said that he is `` very concerned about violence in Egypt , '' tweeting that the `` government must respect the rights of the Egyptian people & turn on social networking and internet . '' \nBut at least one internet service provider , Noor , was still working . \nThe U.S. State Department on Friday urged Americans traveling abroad to `` defer non-essential travel to Egypt . '' \n`` U.S. citizens in Egypt should remain in their residences or hotels until the situation stabilizes , '' the agency added in a written travel alert . \nThe agency warned that Egyptian security forces may block off the area around the U.S. Embassy as a result of massive demonstrations that have set vehicles ablaze and resulted in widespread property damage . \n`` U.S. citizens should not attempt to come to the U.S. Embassy or the Tahrir Square area at such times , '' the statement said , urging Americans to carry identification and a working cell phone . \nDelta Air Lines spokeswoman Susan Elliott said Friday that the carrier 's last flight from Cairo will depart on Saturday , and all other Cairo service is indefinitely suspended as a result of the civil unrest . \nPresident Barack Obama has requested `` multiple briefings '' on Egypt , White House spokesman Tommy Vietor said Friday . \nHe has not called Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak , the target of the protesters ' anger , `` but there is daily contact between the U.S. and Egyptian governments through various channels , including the embassies and other organizations in which Obama 's messages and concerns are relayed , '' Vietor said . \nFormer Clinton Defense Secretary William Cohen said Obama is likely reluctant to call Mubarak `` without it appearing that we are directing what Mubarak should do and he is responding to the control of the United States . '' \n`` I think that , if anything , one might ask why has n't President Mubarak called President Obama and said , ` Are you with me or against me ? ' \nI mean , that would be a call that might also be worthy of consideration , '' Cohen said . \nObama has urged the government and demonstrators to refrain from violence as protests continued . \n`` It is very important that people have mechanisms in order to express legitimate grievances , '' he said this week . \nVice President Joe Biden said on `` PBS NewsHour '' on Thursday that Mubarak should listen to protesters but rejected claims that the embattled Egyptian president is a dictator . \nStill , Biden said , `` violence is n't appropriate , and people have a right to protest . '' \nObama received information on Egypt from national security adviser Tom Donilon on Friday and is expected to receive additional updates throughout the day . \nHe noted Thursday that Mubarak has been `` very helpful on a range of tough issues , '' but he said he has pushed the Egyptian leader to take steps toward reform . \nOn Wednesday , Gibbs said the U.S. administration was `` monitoring quite closely the situation in Egypt and continue to do so , obviously , in Tunisia . '' \nThe protests in Egypt started after weeks of similar disturbances sparked a revolution in Tunisia and forced then-President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali to flee the country . \n`` This is an important time for the government to demonstrate its responsiveness to the people of Egypt in recognizing those universal rights , '' Gibbs said . \nCNN 's Elise Labott and John King contributed to this report . \n"}

'' \nSo far , 148 countries have ratified the U.N. Convention Against Corruption , which outlines a comprehensive anti-corruption framework . \nJournalists in Egypt reveal plight White House shifting tone on Egypt Egyptian opposition leader slams regime This includes a commitment to implement access to information and whistleblower-protection legislation . \nIt also requires laws to prevent money laundering and mechanisms to identify and return stolen assets . \nUnfortunately , in many countries it is largely disregarded . \nIn November , the Group of 20 said it would lead by example and called on all its members to implement the U.N. Convention Against Corruption as part of its Anti-Corruption Action Plan . \nAt Transparency International , we welcomed this strong statement and are following its implementation across the globe . \nThat is a role that civil society can and should play . \nIndependent assessment of government provides an important check on power . \nIt is a foundation stone of a strong democracy . \nClearly , it would be nave to assume that just giving people a greater say in government will end official corruption overnight , but it is an important , necessary starting point . \nOur latest research shows that given the chance , ordinary people will stand up to corruption . \nTwo-thirds of the 91,000 people questioned in 86 countries for our 2010 Global Corruption Barometer said they would support their friends or colleagues if they fought against corruption . \nToday , people see freedom from corruption as a basic human right . \nThey are right to do so . \nNo one should have to live under a regime where corruption is endemic . \nFor Tunisian fruit vendor Mohamed Bouazizi , corruption defeated hope , and he set himself alight , becoming the catalyst to the protests that are holding the world 's attention . \nThe image of his family throwing coins at the local government office gate , money he was allegedly asked to pay as a bribe , is a poignant reminder that corruption kills . \nWhat followed took the world by surprise . \nIt should not have . \nNor should the scenes of people filling the streets to protest against their governments , demanding greater accountability and an end to corruption . \nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Huguette Labelle . \n"}

'' \nThe necklace , which is valued at $ 2,500 , was handed over to police just before they were to execute a search warrant to look for the jewelry in Lohan 's Venice , California , apartment last week . \nLohan was already on supervised probation stemming from probation violations related to a 2007 drunk driving conviction . \nA transitional government is overseeing sweeping changes in Tunisia after massive demonstrations forced out the country 's longtime president and sparked similar protests across the Middle East . \nUnder president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali , the news media was tightly controlled . \nInternet activity was monitored and access to some sites was restricted . \nPolice routinely stopped people without cause to check their identity and question them - it was a policy that the government said was needed to prevent terrorists from gaining a foothold in Tunisia . \nTunisians limited what they spoke about with friends and neighbors for fear that someone might be a police informer . \nToday , internet filters have disappeared and there is unfettered access to all websites . \nJournalists are learning how to create a free press as they transform their newspapers , radio broadcasts and television stations . \nPeople express their opinions openly in the streets . \nReforms are taking place in every region of the country , which is home to about 12 million people . \nThe question is , will these changes last ? \nSnow began falling over Colorado and Kansas Tuesday as yet another round of winter weather began marching across the United States barely a week after a record-setting winter storm roared across the Midwest . \nA powerful weather system poised over the Rockies is forecast to dump several feet of snow in the Mountain West and up to 10 inches in some parts of Oklahoma , forecasters said . \nMuch of Oklahoma is under a winter storm warning , but snow and sleet are predicted as far south as central Texas , with 2 to 4 inches expected to coat the Dallas-Fort Worth area , the National Weather Service said . \nLater in the week , the system is expected to bring rain and snow to many areas of the Deep South before delivering a wintry mix along portions of the East Coast by Thursday . \nWith protesters still in the streets of Cairo and newly appointed government officials meeting with some opposition leaders , Egypt faces an uncertain future . \nThe outcome will depend largely on the course charted by a transitional government . \nMany other countries have been down the path Egypt finds itself on . \nA popular uprising undermines the authority of a long-standing regime and a period of chaos ensues . \nTransitional governments often take control and their success at ushering in change varies depending on a multitude of factors . \n`` In many of these cases , if the military splits or goes against the ruler and helps to bring in some transition with popular support , it still may take a cycle or more to get to an actual democratic regime or to accomplish real change , '' said Georgia State University political science professor Jennifer McCoy , citing past transitions in Latin American , Eastern Europe and the Philippines . \nThere is no guaranteed route to success , McCoy said , and often , while there may be some wholesale changes , the people in positions of authority remain at the top in transitional governments . \nIn a case where there is no clear leader or leading group such as in Egypt today that spurred the change , it s very difficult to predict where it s going to go .

'' \nIts traditions have favored women 's rights , and its Islamist influence is negligible . \nThe United States and other governments are monitoring the demonstrations in Cairo and elsewhere closely . \nU.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urged all people to `` exercise restraint '' and supported `` the fundamental right of expression and assembly for all people . '' \n`` But our assessment is that the Egyptian government is stable and is looking for ways to respond to the legitimate needs and interests of the Egyptian people , '' she said . \nTo highlight the role of police corruption , the protest organizers in Egypt picked January 25 -- Police Day and a national holiday -- to hold protests . \nThe protests started off small , but they grew as people came to the center of the city from bridges over the Nile River . \nThousands protest corruption in Egypt Could Tunisia 's unrest spread to Egypt ? \nTear gas fired at Cairo protesters Witnesses said large groups of plainclothes police were heading to Tahrir Square . \nProtesters had been expressing their anger over the rising cost of living , failed economic policies and corruption , but all those concerns were distilled into one overriding demand : the resignation of President Hosni Mubarak , in power for three decades . \nThe outpouring included young and old , Christians and Muslims , students , workers and businesspeople . \n`` We breathe corruption in the air , '' said one demonstrator , who along with others said their children have no future . \nAt its peak there were perhaps 15,000 to 20,000 people in Tahrir Square , but that crowd later dwindled to about 5,000 to 8,000 . \nThe main road in front of parliament , Qasr Al-Aini , was closed to traffic . \nThe square is two blocks from parliament . \n`` Egyptians have the right to express themselves , '' Foreign Ministry spokesman Hossam Zaki said of the protests . \nThe Interior Ministry called on demonstrators to follow the law and avoid threatening the safety of bystanders , the public and private property . \nSocial media have been all-important in mobilizing and organizing protests . \nBut bloggers and others in Egypt reported problems with electronic communication later in the day . \nActivists ca n't access their cell phones or text messages , and opposition websites ca n't be accessed . \nTwitter was blocked in Egypt about 11 a.m. ET , the company said . \nThere were other demonstrations in Cairo suburbs of Heliopolis , Shubra Al-Khaima , Muhandasin and Dar Al-Salam . \nOne man said Egypt is not Tunisia , it 's Romania under Nicolae Ceausescu , a reference to the late and much-reviled communist leader . \nThe Front to Defend Egypt Protesters , an alliance of lawyers who helped organize the events , said that about 200 demonstrators were in the southern city of Aswan , 2,000 in the eastern city of Ismailiya and about 3,000 in the northern city of Mahallah . \nThe Egyptian government did not issue permits for Tuesday 's planned protests . \nIn an interview released Tuesday with state-run al-Ahram newspaper , Interior Minister Habib Adly warned that `` the security agencies are able to stop any attempt to attend '' the demonstrations and called the efforts of the `` youth staging street protests ineffective . '' \nBy early Tuesday morning , more than 90,000 people throughout the country had pledged to participate in the Facebook event `` We Are All Khaled Said , '' named after an Alexandria activist who was allegedly beaten to death by police . \nThe Facebook group demands raising the minimum wage , firing the interior minister , creating two-term presidential term limits and scrapping existing emergency laws that the group says `` resulted in police control '' over the people and the nation . \nAmnesty International released a statement Monday `` urging the Egyptian authorities not to crack down '' on the planned nationwide demonstration . \nThe banned Muslim Brotherhood , the biggest organized opposition to Mubarak 's regime , had stated it would not have an official presence at Tuesday 's protests , but some of its members `` have reportedly been summoned and threatened with arrest and detention '' if they attend and protest , Amnesty International said . \nOpposition leader and Nobel Peace laureate Mohamed ElBaradei posted statements supporting the protests on his Twitter account . \nHe also created a video statement addressing policemen that was released Monday on YouTube . \n`` I sympathize with you because sometimes you are asked to do things that you do not want to do , '' ElBaradei said . \n`` One day , I hope that you will regain your role as the protectors of the people ; rather than protectors of ... fraud elections . \nI am sure that every one of you deep inside is looking forward to the day that his role will again be with the people and a part of them , rather than against them , '' he said . \nPublic sentiment against state security forces has grown recently with alleged videos of police brutality shown on the internet . \nA recent report from Human Rights Watch said the problem is `` epidemic , '' and `` in most cases , officials torture detainees to obtain information and coerce confessions , occasionally leading to death in custody . '' \nSome other human rights groups , such as the Arabic Network for Human Rights , have drawn a comparison between Egypt and Tunisia under Ben Ali , in terms of the level of government corruption and police brutality . \nAdly , the Egyptian interior minister , dismissed any such comparisons , calling it `` propaganda '' that had been rejected by politicians as `` intellectual immaturity . '' \nBut one woman , identified only as Nahla , who planned to attend the Tuesday protests , disagreed . \nShe wrote in an online post , `` I hope the -LRB- Tunisia-style -RRB- revolution will be taught in history . \nAnd that Egyptians will learn in school later about the January 25th revolution .

JOHN BOEHNER -LRB- R -RRB- , HOUSE SPEAKER : Glad to be here with you . \nPARKER : All right . \nLet 's cut straight to the State of the Union address last night . \nThe president kept saying this is a Sputnik moment . \nWhat kind of moment would you say we 're in right now ? \nBOEHNER : Well , if you really want to talk about what the Sputnik moment is , it 's the fact that we 're broke . \nBOEHNER : The American people know we 're broke and they want us to do something about spending . \nAnd there was n't much talk last night about cutting spending and getting our debt under control . \nPARKER : And would you cut Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security ? \nBOEHNER : If we lead with our chin , nothing happens . \nThat 's what 's happened in Washington for the last 25 years . \nI think that we need to have both parties working together to help explain to the American people the size of the problem and an array of possible solutions and out of that conversation we 'll begin to resolve what is possible . \nPARKER : All right . \nWell , let 's just focus on one piece of it . \nLet 's look at Social Security . \nSpeaker Boehner , you have said that you would support or consider supporting raising the retirement age for Social Security . \nWould you go on record tonight and say that you will do that ? \nBOEHNER : I do n't -- I made a mistake when I did that because I think having the conversation about how big the problem is is the first step . \nAnd once the American people understand how big the problem is , then you can begin to outline an array of possible solutions . \nBut when you look at life expectancy in America today and you look at the Social Security system , we 're all living far longer than anyone had ever anticipated and the result of these big demographic changes is having a disastrous effect on the Social Security program . \nAnd so raising the retirement age or considering it is something that ought to be on the table . \nPARKER : OK , so raising the retirement age is on the table . \nAnd you keep saying -- Speaker Boehner , you keep talking about an adult conversation . \nAnd nobody really -- yes , we have to have one . \nEveryone I 've talked to , I ca n't -- most people say , look , even -- Obama 's plans , even the plans that the Republicans have put forward , there 's really no way to get out of this economic mess without these drastic spending cuts that we 're talking about , cutting back on entitlements but also raising taxes . \nUltimately are we going to have to raise taxes ? \nBOEHNER : Raising taxes is the wrong prescription for where we are . \nIt 's pretty clear to me the cutting of spending is the most important thing we can do to get the American people back to work . \nThat and eliminating a lot of the uncertainty of this coming out of this administration . \nThe most important thing we can do to increase federal revenues is to get the American people back to work . \nWhether they 're taking care of themselves , their families and back on the tax rolls helping to supply income to the federal government to meet the demands of the American people . \nYou 're not going to get people back to work by taxing the very people that we expected to reinvest in our economy . \nPARKER : Now we are talking about a debt and deficit of enormous proportions and I do n't know how you can cut enough without also raising taxes . \nBOEHNER : You ca n't raise -- PARKER : Believe me , I do n't want to pay more taxes . \nBOEHNER : You do n't -- you ca n't raise enough to solve the problem . \nAnd you ca n't spend -- you ca n't cut enough spending to solve this problem . \nTwo things have to happen if we 're serious . \nWe 've got to hold the line on spending and we have to get the American people back to work . \nPARKER : Last night after the State of the Union address , Michele Bachmann got up and gave her own response . \nNow she did this without consulting you . \nYou 're the most powerful man in the House of Representatives certainly and one of the top -- most powerful men in the nation . \nAnd she decides to go out on her own and give a response . \nAre you able to manage these people ? \nBOEHNER : Well , the official -- the official response was given by Paul Ryan , who 's chosen by Senator McConnell and I , to give our response . \nBut understand that every member of Congress , Democrat and Republican , does a response to the State of the Union . \nI mean in years past I 've been on a number of TV shows , I 've done a number radio programs back in my district . \nEveryone does something to respond to the State of the Union . \nShe decided to do hers in front of a Tea Party group . \nPARKER : But the Tea Party people can be a little unruly at times , ca n't they ? \nBOEHNER : Well , if you look at what the Tea Party folks were saying , it was n't any different than what the rest of America was saying . \nThat spending is out of control and we 've got to get our economy moving again to get people back to work . \nPARKER : Speaker Boehner , do n't the American people want you to work with the president and with the Democrats to find common ground and solve these problems ? \nBOEHNER : Well , clearly , and we are going to find common ground . \nI 'm not going to say it 's going to be easy but we 're going to find some way to find common ground in cutting spending . \nThe president talked about tax reform last night and I think there are ways where we can simplify both the corporate tax code and the personal tax code . \nAnd I 'm optimistic that we can work together on that . \nPARKER : Could you get that down to one page , please ? \nThat tax bill , that tax reform ? \nI want one page . \nBOEHNER : You and I and every American would love to have that . \nPARKER : You 've been -- you 've come from -- as you said , you had sort of a -- not a privileged upbringing and now you are speaker . \nPARKER : Of the House . \nAnd last night the president recognized you as sort of symbolizing the American dream . \nSo let 's take a look at that . \nBARACK OBAMA , PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES : We may have different backgrounds but we believe in the same dream that says this is a country where anything is possible , no matter who you are . \nNo matter where you come from . \nThat dream is why I can stand here before you tonight . \nThat dream is why a working class kid from Scranton can sit behind me . \nThat dream is why someone who began by sweeping the floors of his father 's Cincinnati bar can preside as speaker of the House in the greatest nation on earth . \nPARKER : So how did that feel ? \nBOEHNER : It was a nice moment for Joe and I and for the president . \nBut I think it gives -- it gives every American the opportunity to look up and say , hey , you know , they can do it , I can do it . \nSPITZER : When we come back Speaker Boehner finally explains exactly why he did n't go to the state dinner with the Chinese president last week . \nHas he rethought his decision ? \nDo n't go away . \nWe 'll be right back . \nSPITZER : Now more of Kathleen 's exclusive interview with speaker of the House John Boehner on why he 's been spurning the president 's invitations and how he felt when he heard about the Tucson shootings . \nPARKER : Speaker Boehner , despite your new position in life , your new elevated place , you seem to me to be a little shy nonetheless . \nMaybe a bit of an introvert like me . \nYou do n't like to go to parties much . \nYou do n't even like to go to state dinners . \nBOEHNER : Now , listen , I 've been to one state dinner in 20 years . \nIt 's just not -- the idea of putting on a tuxedo and sitting in a room for a long boring night , that 's not my idea of a nice evening . \nPARKER : Well , none of us really likes to sit in a boring room all night , but , you know , you turned down the state dinner with China 's President Hu Jintao . \nBOEHNER : I was meeting with him the next day . \nI was hosting him here in the Capitol and I really did n't see any reason to have -- to go have dinner the night before and then host a meeting up here the next day . \nI knew I was going to have my chance to talk to him . \nPARKER : So you do n't want to see people two days in a row ? \nPARKER : Do you not feel , though , as speaker of the House that you have a duty to show up to some of these functions just because of that 's who you are ? \nBOEHNER : Apparently a lot of people think that I do , and so maybe the next time I 'll reconsider . \nPARKER : You have an idea about what the House needs to be . \nI know you wanted to restore honor to the House as you see it . \nTell us about that . \nBOEHNER : Well , the Congress is broken and I think most Americans realize that Congress is broken . \nAnd over the last five or 10 years , it 's been evident to me that we 're moving in the wrong direction . \nYou know , in the last few years there were about five members who decided what the beginning of the bill looked like and the same five members who decided what the end of the bill was going to look like , coerced the process to achieve an outcome while 430 of us , each representing 650,000 people , we sat on the sidelines . \nAnd I gave a speech on the floor of the House in 1991 . \nI had been here about six months and they had to bring in a bill to the floor under a close rule , and I said this . \nI said , what do we have to fear in allowing the house to work its will ? \nWell , I do n't feel any differently about it today than I did then . \nSo my -- what I believe is necessary is we need to open up the House . \nWe need to let all members from both parties participate in the debate , offer their ideas , represent their constituents and let the House work its will . \nThe House should not be coerced to produce legislation that fits my needs . \nOr to fit anyone else 's needs . \nAnd I do believe that if we open up the House , it 'll drive more power back to the committees where members were going to have to begin to work together again . \nAnd I think the result of this is that we 'll have better legislation , we 'll have more bipartisan legislation and we will begin to melt the scar tissue that is built up between the two political parties . \nPARKER : Do you feel like last night 's date night helped toward that end ? \nBOEHNER : Well , I do n't know whether date night helped , but it was nice to see members spread out . \nThe vice president and I were not going to engage in the constantly jumping up and down and clapping . \nThis is the State of the Union . \nThe president comes here at the invitation of the Congress and the Congress in my view ought to respect the fact that a president has accepted the invitation and there ought to be more dignity at this event . \nLast night was better than what we 've seen in the past . \nNot as -- not as dignified as I 'd like to see it but we 're moving in the right direction . \nPARKER : I watched you and you have a poker face . \nIt 's very hard to read what 's going on . \nBOEHNER : Oh , I did n't last night . \nWell , you know , it 's difficult . \nYou 're sitting behind the president . \nYou got these cameras on you , you know , and my -- one of my girls sent me a text and said now just remember this camera is going to be on you looking for any bit of a reaction . \nSo I tried to do as good a job as I could . \nI did not want to be the issue . \nI never wanted to be the issue because this is not about me . \nPARKER : I 've heard that about you . \nI 've heard that you have kind of a coach 's approach to running the House . \nPARKER : You 're very happy to delegate and let other people have the limelight ? \nBOEHNER : I 've run my business , run my office and now hopefully run the House in a way where I try to build consensus . \nBuild consensus , move ahead . \nBuild consensus , move ahead . \nI do n't have to be in charge . \nBut my job is to bring people together , get people to work together to achieve a common good and the common good here is following the will of the American people . \nAnd I think there are a lot of Democrats and Republicans who do want to come together to fulfill the common good . \nPARKER : Do you feel like you have a good relationship with the president ? \nBOEHNER : I do . \nYou know , as I 've said it 's not particularly close , but we get along fine but I suspect over the coming months it 'll get a little closer . \nPARKER : You know one of the words that I listened out for in his speech last night was the word exceptional . \nI heard him use it when -- in Tucson . \nIn Tucson , of course , it 's been this horrific event for the whole country . \nBut I did n't hear him say it and I thought at a time when you 're building a speech around sort of defining the common purpose of America , that seemed to me a rather -- you know , a simple direct line , fairly -- pretty much a no-brainer , but he did n't say it . \nBOEHNER : Well , they -- they 've refused to talk about America exceptionalism . \nWe are different than the rest of the world . \nBecause Americans have -- the country was built on an idea that ordinary people could decide what their government looked like and ordinary people could elect their own leaders . \nAnd 235 years ago that was a pretty novel idea . \nAnd so we are different . \nWhy is our economy still 20 times the size of China 's ? \nBecause Americans have had their freedom to succeed , the freedom to fail . \nWe 've got more innovators , more entrepreneurs , and that is exceptional but you ca n't get the left to talk about it . \nThey do n't -- they reject that notion . \nPARKER : Why do you think that is ? \nBOEHNER : I do n't know . \nI do n't know . \nI do n't know if they 're afraid of it , whether they do n't believe it . \nI do n't know . \nPARKER : Going back one more time to the moment when Nancy Pelosi handed you that gavel , can you describe to me what that moment was like ? \nBOEHNER : It was nice . \nIt was n't -- I was proud to be there . \nBOEHNER : I was proud to be there . \nI was honored to be there . \nYou know , it 's an honor to be chosen by your colleagues to be their leader . \nBut I 've been as steady and calm over the last four or five months than I 've been in years and you ca n't get too excited because you know that while there may be a moment of excitement , there is a mountain of work looking at you the next day , and so it was nice , but it was a long day . \nPARKER : Sad , sad moment when we all got the news of what had happened in Tucson . \nAnd you are the speaker of the House . \nThis is your -- you know , your crowd and I know a lot of people -- everyone was very upset when you heard that Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords had been shot . \nHow did you feel ? \nBOEHNER : Well , I felt awful . \nBOEHNER : It was -- it was one of our own , and in addition to that , just was n't her , it was one of her staffers was killed and , you know , while most people do n't think much about our staff or just does n't come to mind , you know , there are about 10,000 staffers who work here on Capitol Hill . \nAnd it might have been the moment -- I had only been speaker for about three days and I really began -- I realized at that moment that I am the speaker and I 've got a big job to do . \nThere are a lot of pieces to what happens up here on Capitol Hill and who 's responsible , and on that Saturday I was responsible for a lot of it . \nBut I talked to the president . \nWorked with our security people and our logistics people and there were a lot to do . \nPARKER : Have you been in touch ? \nHave you been in touch ? \nBOEHNER : I sent her a card yesterday . \nI -- SPITZER : We 'll have a final thought from Kathleen 's exclusive conversation with Speaker Boehner later in the show . \nBut first coming up next , in Egypt , an explosion of violence in the streets and a government in crisis . \nThanks in part to twitter and Facebook , the young people of that nation rise up threatening the stability of what had been that region 's only stable country . \nHarrowing details when we come back . \nSPITZER : Violence and revolt in Egypt tonight , a country that was until now America 's most stable ally in the Middle East . \nThousands of protesters took to the streets for a second day calling for the resignation of President Hosni Mubarak . \nThe protesters were met with police using teargas , batons and water canons . \nFour people have died . \nMore than 100 are injured and things appear to be getting worse . \nHow did this happen ? \nWhat will it mean for America and the Middle East ? \nJoining me now from Cairo is CNN senior international correspondent Ben Wedeman . \nBen , thanks for joining us . \nBEN WEDEMAN , CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : My pleasure , Eliot . \nSPITZER : So , Ben , fill us in . \nWhat is the latest ? \nWhat is happening in the streets and what happened there today ? \nWEDEMAN : Well , today started off fairly quiet with just a few scattered demonstrations , but the Interior Ministry made it clear early in the day that no protests would be tolerated . \nSo we saw around town small groups forming , trying to reproduce the massive demonstrations Cairo saw yesterday , but the crackdown was severe . \nThe police , no restraint today as we saw yesterday in relative terms , using their clubs , using their water cannon , using rubber bullets and teargas to try to disperse the demonstrators . \nBut every group they dispersed , another group formed somewhere else . \nWe 're hearing that the city of Suez on the Suez Canal is in a state of open or insurrection against the government that the police have pulled out of the city and that they are now burning down things like police stations and ruling party headquarters . \nSo even though the numbers of demonstrators in the streets of Cairo were smaller , it seems that this movement that really began sparked yesterday is not losing any momentum . \nSPITZER : What are the demands of the protesters if they can be discerned or known at this time ? \nAnd is there even an organization there to make demands ? \nWEDEMAN : Well , there 's not really an organization . \nWhat we have is something probably unique in history . \nWe have Facebook groups that have formed . \nAnd they had some basic demands . \nThey want a minimum wage . \nThey want an end to police brutality , an end to corruption , and more than anything what you hear from people in the street is one single very profound demand . \nThey want the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak who has been ruling this country longer than most Egyptians have been alive -- Eliot ? \nSPITZER : And is there any possibility that Mubarak would either resign and who is there to take over ? \nWhat would happen if he were to step down ? \nIs there an alternate government ? \nHis son has been apparently slated to take over . \nWhat could possibly happen ? \nWEDEMAN : Well , there 's a whole variety of scenarios , all of which have a lot of question marks around them . \nFirst of all , President Mubarak has not uttered a word in public since these demonstrations happened which is causing a good deal of concern , causing some people to think that the government is simply losing its grip at the moment . \nHe has no vice president . \nHe 's been president since 1981 and has always refused to appoint one saying that the people will decide . \nWell , the people have n't had a chance to decide this matter . \nThere 's a lot of talk about his so son , Gamal Mubarak , businessman , a banker in his mid-40s , taking over . \nBut Egyptians across the board have rejected that option . \nThey say we are after all a republic , not a monarchy , they do n't want that sort of system . \nThere 's always the option that the army can take over but that is something most people do n't really think is possible unless the situation goes out of control . \nSPITZER : Was there any intimation ? \nWas there any evidence that this could erupt in a place like Egypt ? \nWEDEMAN : I have to confess that I and all of my colleagues in the press corps here and all the protesters I spoke with , nobody predicted that it would get so big so fast and throughout the country . \nIt 's taken everybody by shock . \nThe police , as well . \nThey did n't expect this . \nAnd there were reasons for popular discontent . \nPolice brutality , corruption , under a president that 's been in power since 1981 , and -- but nobody thought that this would happen so dramatically so quickly . \nSPITZER : What has the press coverage of these revolts been and these protests ? \nHas it been supportive ? \nHas it led to larger and larger protests building up in different neighborhoods ? \nWEDEMAN : All right . \nThis is the state paper , sort of the gray lady of Egypt . \nTop story , `` Riots and Unrest , '' but it 's not in Egypt . \nIt 's in Lebanon . \nThe Egypt protest is below the fold . \nThis is referring to yesterday . \nHere is another newspaper . \nAl Masry Al Youm . \nHere you have top story , great big red headline says , `` Warning . '' \nComplete comprehensive coverage , very positive about the protest , so two completely different ways of looking at the demonstrations , and this really gives you an idea of the chasm between the official stance on these demonstrations and a more sort of independent popular view of what they mean and where they 're going . \nELIOT SPITZER , HOST : It seems that the communication between or among the protesters is on twitter , is on Facebook , is on social media . \nIs there any way for the government to shut that down ? \nWEDEMAN : Well , one important thing to point out is that Egypt has never put any blocks on the Internet . \nEgyptians can go to any site they want . \nHowever , yesterday during the protests , Twitter suddenly was blocked and that was one of the main forms of spreading information and spreading news about Egypt . \nEgyptian officials insist they did nothing . \nThey say that the system was overwhelmed and it simply did n't function in Egypt . \nAnd what 's interesting is that it took about an hour and a half ago , mid-evening in Cairo , the Twitter page was working again , but Twitter and Facebook , things like text messages have been key to spread the word to organize these demonstrations and to keep them going and to spread information so Egyptians even at these demonstrations , they 're half the time chanting , the other time they 're looking down at their mobile phones to read text messages to check Facebook , to check Twitter . \nSo it 's a very techie revolution if we can call it that . \nSPITZER : Who are the protesters ? \nWEDEMAN : There are students , workers , housewives . \nYou see middle - aged couples coming out to chant `` down with Mubarak . '' \nThere are sort of every sector of Egyptians deciding . \nWhat 's interesting is that the Muslim brotherhood , the largest political opposition bloc in Egypt is not taking part in these demonstrations . \nThey 're taking part as members , but as a group , it declined to participate . \nAnd what this really is , is at least , until now , is a secular movement . \nIt has no religious undertones . \nSPITZER : Ben Wedeman in Cairo , thank you so much for joining us . \nObviously this story will be continuing as this arc of revolution seems to be sweeping from Tunisia to Egypt , on to Lebanon . \nNo doubt we will be talking in the next couple of days . \nWe 'll be right back . \nSPITZER : Last night , President Obama laid out his agenda and he challenged us to be better -- a better country with a bigger future . \nBut again , I ask the same question I asked at the top of the show , how do we do it ? \nWith me tonight , two friends of the show were always grounded in reality , our conservative tag team , Will Cain from `` The National Review '' and conservative analyst E.D. Hill . \nWelcome to both of you as always . \nE.D. HILL , CONSERVATIVE ANALYST : Thank you . \nSPITZER : So , E.D. , let me start with you . \nWe heard the two rebuttals , responses from the Republican side . \nWe heard Paul Ryan , Michele Bachmann . \nDid either one of them give you a sense that they really knew how they were going to close this huge deficit that was what the Republican Party ran on last November ? \nHILL : They may have an idea but they certainly did n't share it , neither did President Obama . \nThat 's the problem that we face with Washington as a whole . \nWe just listened to John Boehner , as well . \nHe had the chance to say , yes , I would suggest we cut social security or we do this . \nHe did n't do it . \nHe said , well , everything is on the table . \nEverything is always on the table unless you 're not talking at all . \nYet no one is willing to take that step and say , let 's talk about this specifically . \nAnd that was my problem with all of them . \nSPITZER : And , look , I completely agree . \nI listened to them and then I read the transcripts looking for something concrete . \nBut , you know , well it seems your point about President Obama say not so much for him either , but this was the mantra of the Tea Party and the Republican Party and there 's Paul Ryan , the whiz kid budget guy , everybody has pointed to all season . \nAm I missing something ? \nWILL CAIN , `` NATIONAL REVIEW '' : Yes , I think you did on Ryan . \nFirst , Bachmann , no it was n't there . \nIf I told you last night we were getting a speech , a late night speech , from somebody whose eyeliner had gotten a little out of control and they started at your left ear as they spoke to you the entire time -- HILL : Do n't get on her makeup and the way she looked . \nCAIN : Do you think I was talking about the rebuttal of the State of the Union , or the late night closing time of Dorothy 's bumper club ? \nI mean -- SPITZER : No , no , I 'm watching you . \nHILL : You guys go after the women . \nIf the guy looks -- if the guy -- my eyeliner is fine . \nIf the guys look bad , you would n't be saying that . \nCAIN : No , let me tell you why I 'm hard -- SPITZER : I 'm with E.D. on this one . \nCAIN : Let me tell you why I 'm hard on Michele Bachmann . \nLet me tell you why I 'm hard on her . \nBecause I align myself very closely to Tea Party values and principles . \nAnd I think the Tea Party is an introspective movement that forces conservatives to look at the way we 've taken opportunities to govern , to really realign our priorities . \nAnd what I heard from Michele Bachmann last night was blame -- blame , not unfairly appointed to Obama but way too external . \nWe need to look at ourselves and that 's what I did n't hear from Michele Bachmann . \nI think Paul Ryan did begin to give us the message . \nI do think we heard something . \nActually I think it was subtle . \nI think it was when we talked -- SPITZER : That could be why I missed it . \nWhen he talked about social security , he said when we look at reforming entitlements , we will not touch the entitlements of people who are in or near retirement . \nI think that was a nod to the road back for America . \nI think he was saying there we do have a solution for your entitlement problem , and I 've already put it together and it does n't touch the entitlements of old people . \nHILL : More people just hitting you upside the head with a two by four and telling you what they 're going to do . \nSPITZER : I 'm with E.D. on this one . \nI mean , if that was , in fact , the subtle message , and I heard that . \nAnd I thought maybe this was a nod towards raising the retirement age or somehow changing the contribution structure . \nSPITZER : But this was his moment to speak to the nation and just as with John Boehner 's interview a few moments ago on the show , we said we have to have the conversation . \nFellows , this is the conversation . \nYou seize the moment to lead . \nI mean , that 's what disappointed me . \nCAIN : He 's got 10 minutes . \nIs that 10 minutes ? \nYou 're not going to lay out your budget proposals in 10 minutes . \nI expect to hear them in the coming days and weeks . \nHILL : I expected to hear him last night . \nI 'm not giving him a pass because they 're the professionals . \nThey 're the ones who have compose chosen to do this for their life . \nThey 're the ones who have told us that they can lead us , that they can figure out the way to make our country better and they do n't . \nSPITZER : What do you think of Michele Bachmann or Paul Ryan should have said ? \nHILL : I think they should have given specifics . \nLet 's go with Bachmann . \nShe was really railing on everybody else and what 's , you know , hurting us . \nThen you know what , then take that step and call them out . \nCall out India and say you 're not opening up your domestic markets to our companies . \nSo you know what , we can do it . \nAmerica can do it . \nOur companies can do it , but give us a fair playing field . \nAnd neither of them did that . \nNeither did President Obama . \nSPITZER : Social security . \nLet 's just stick to that for one more second . \nSPITZER : Because it is the touchtone , or Medicare or Medicaid . \nShould they have said directly we will raise the retirement age and here 's when and how we 'll do it ? \nSuch as the bipartisan commission did -- CAIN : Principally , principally yes . \nIt would be an entire political mistake to suggest that the House of Representatives now controlled by the Republicans will put out entitlement reform only to be vetoed and lambasted in the Senate and at the presidency . \nPrincipally , I would love to hear it . \nHILL : This should have come from Obama . \nIt was his bipartisan commission that came up with it . \nSPITZER : We 'll get to that in a minute . \nI agree , and I 've written the same thing . \nI wish he had done that . \nI would have said it because I think it is incumbent now given the crisis that we are facing for them to get to that point and say it . \nLet 's move on to the president 's speech for a minute . \nCAIN : Yes , that was an hour long speech compared to these two -- SPITZER : All right . \nBut look , they all had their moments to pick and choose what to say . \nThe president 's speech struck me as in a way schizophrenic . \nOn the one hand talking about a lot of investment , on the other hand talking about the fact that we have a deficit and therefore he was going to freeze domestic spending . \nI want to focus for a moment on the investments he talked about and conceptually you , as conservatives , do agree with him increasing investment in education to upgrade the quality of our human capital as they call it . \nHILL : I agree with increasing investments in a certain way . \nI guess getting money back to people and to companies . \nI do n't agree with more government spending . \nI agree with giving people more money for them to spend . \nSPITZER : Let me refine that . \nHILL : Education -- you can put more people through college but if they do n't have jobs when they come out of it , it does n't really matter . \nSPITZER : That 's certainly right . \nBut do you agree with expanding Pell Grants , for instance , expanding the G.I. bill concept of giving people access to loans , to pay college tuitions that are right now beyond the reach of many ? \nHILL : Specifically what he said was , you know , you should get a tax break for college tuition . \nI 'm totally on board . \nCAIN : You and I talked about it . \nI think you 're touching on the edges of education reform almost worthlessly . \nUntil we start talking about the way to improve our students ' test scores , I do n't care how many you send to college . \nSPITZER : Well , you care about -- I do n't want it . \nCAIN : You get my point . \nSPITZER : I get your point . \nI 'm trying to save you -- HILL : I 'm trying to send one in college . \nSPITZER : But in that case what would you do ? \nWhat would your education reform agenda be ? \nAnd , look , the president has raced to the top which many people give a lot of credit to . \nWould you expand on that ? \nCAIN : I do n't think education reform has to be centered in Washington , D.C. I think education reform can be done at the state and even at a local level where you actually know who your bureaucrats are and know who your teachers are . \nHILL : I agree with that . \nCAIN : I think that 's the way to go about education reform . \nSPITZER : But do you think that the president and Arne Duncan , the secretary of education , who is viewed by many as almost a visionary has done a good job using the federal money as a way , basically as candy saying to the states , embrace reform and we will compensate you for it . \nHILL : I 'm with Will on this . \nI do n't think that this is one of many jobs that federal government ca n't do as well as state and local governments . \nI think states understand what the unique problems are to their localities . \nThey need to be handling this . \nSPITZER : All right . \nWe 'll put education aside but let 's go to another type of investment , the infrastructure investments he keeps talking about . \nRoad , highways , the Internet . \nHILL : We both sat back . \nCAIN : I know you want to go through every single investment , but let me just say -- SPITZER : I 'm trying to understand your sense here . \nCAIN : I want to give you my sense . \nAnd here it is . \nWhen the president -- the president and I have very different visions of America . \nWhen the president uses words like innovate and compete and work hard and do more , '' he 's talking about the collective we . \nHe 's talking about government . \nThese are words that I have traditionally assigned , and I think America has assigned to individuals and entrepreneurs . \nThey are who innovate . \nThey are who make us competitive . \nIf the government can do things to get out of their way , that is a beneficial step . \nSPITZER : But do you agree , E.D. , that the notion of basic research being funded by the Defense Department , by NASA , by government , which has led to so many of these critical investments , let 's face it the Internet really did come out of government labs . \nDo you buy that notion , therefore , health research , good idea , bad idea ? \nHILL : I think that research is a good idea . \nHowever , I want to go back to your idea about this whole transportation and the infrastructure because I spent last summer driving across America with a bunch of my kids and I kept on seeing this `` your federal stimulus dollars at work . '' \nThey were out there ripping up highways and literally in the middle of cornfields that were perfectly fine and repaving them . \nAnd to me that 's not accomplishing anything . \nUse that money wisely . \nThat 's what they do n't do . \nCAIN : You used the word I think was completely appropriate earlier . \nAt one point in the president 's speech last night , he said nobody could have seen the Internet coming . \nAnd then in other parts , he suggests that he can peer into the future and see what the future energy sources for America are and we 'll subsidize those . \nThere 's a huge amount of hubris and arrogance in that assumption that you actually know . \nWhy is there not some kid working on cold fusion or turning ocean water into oil ? \nWhy do you know it 's wind ? \nWhy are you going to allocate so much of our money to that ? \nSPITZER : Will , I think he 's saying something different . \nI think what he is saying is that the Department of Energy which has funded so much of the critical breakthrough technologies when it comes to energy wo n't play venture capital firm trying to pick companies and invest in them . \nIt will give grants to universities , University of Chicago . \nYou know , pick your favorite state university and say , you do the research on fusion , on fission . \nHILL : But we 've been researching . \nWe know what works . \nYou just ca n't -- SPITZER : No , we do n't yet know . \nHILL : You know that wind works , you know solar works , you know nuclear works and yet you do n't -- you 've got . \nSPITZER : But clean coal , for instance -- clean coal , which I think we all aspire to have as part of our complex of energy sources , you know , using traditional dirty coal but somehow taking the carbon dioxide and submerging it below ground so we do n't have the green gas issues , that is only going to happen if the federal government subsidizes it . \nCAIN : Eliot , if these are real , viable businesses that have a place in the market , they will figure out a way to make it on their own . \nI 'm afraid you 'll spend 50 years funding projects that have no future and in 50 years we 'll look back and it will be the equivalent of you trying to fund jet packs . \nSPITZER : Let me ask you a question . \nHILL : -- say the same thing . \nWe need to be researching . \nI think fish or cut bait . \nLet 's go out there and start making some changes . \nSPITZER : Have you spoken to any executive in the nuclear sector recently ? \nThey will tell you they want to build plants but what do they need ? \nThey need federal guarantees on the loan . \nThey need limitations and liability . \nThese are the sorts of government assistance projects that are in my view neither conservative nor liberal . \nThey are market intervention but the nuclear sector wo n't be part of our energy structure if we do n't do it . \nAre you against that ? \nCAIN : No , I 'm not against that . \nI think there is some place for some role in the government aiding some businesses along at a very , very small level . \nNot for a new investment as it was put out last night . \nCAIN : Not for the increasing our spending to the degrees that we 've been hearing . \nLook , this is going to be a continuing conversation with as we call you `` our tag team of conservatives . '' \nSee if we can put up on the screen here my favorite chart . \nHILL : Oh , good . \nSPITZER : Here we go . \nLook at this chart for a second . \nIt shows you -- HILL : Bachmann was using charts too . \nSPITZER : I like that . \nThat 's the part I liked about the speech . \nI got a copy here . \nYou ca n't see . \nSPITZER : Top one percent has had income go up 281 percent . \nMiddle class in the 25 percent , about 1980 . \nHILL : Is this your spreadsheet at home ? \nCAIN : No , I agree with E.D. HILL : Keeping people from making money , no , I do n't think they should do . \nI do n't think it 's the government 's job to redistribute that into some sense that you think is more fair . \nI want the rising tide to lift all those -- HILL : I like you speechless . \nCAIN : I want them -- HILL : He 's looking and saying , are you crazy ? \nSPITZER : No , I 'm just trying to watch you dig a little deeper . \nCAIN : I want the rising tide to lift all those . \nI want the middle class incomes to have greater purchasing power . \nI do n't think it has to be in direct proportion to the wealthiest in society . \nSPITZER : What if the rising tide is lifting only the yachts , but not the rowboats ? \nDoes that bother you ? \nHILL : I do n't think in our economy that is what will happen . \nCertainly you can -- I know . \nCertainly you can pull out your chart and you can show that . \nAnd recently that is the case . \nBut I think that if the federal government backs off and lets people take more control of their own lives , of their companies , helps small , medium size companies do better , gives them the tax breaks , I think you do bring all those boats up . \nSPITZER : Will , Will wants to raise the yachts . \nCAIN : No , I think the issue is a tad bit more complicated than your chart . \nAnd I think there are income and wealth opportunities included in that middle class line that do n't show up . \nI think there are health care benefits . \nThey 're provided through the employer that do n't show up on that line . \nHILL : Will , you 're challenging him to come up with another chart . \nSPITZER : Next time , more charts . \nThat 's what you want . \nE.D. and Will , as always thanks for being with us . \nComing up , Kathleen asked Speaker of the House John Boehner , any politician 's favorite question . \nSPITZER : There 's one question no prominent politician can avoid , but that does n't mean they do n't love to be asked . \nKathleen sprints it on Speaker Boehner . \nKATHLEEN PARKER , HOST : I was thinking about 2012 , at last count about 413 people running for the Republican nomination for president . \nREP. JOHN BOEHNER -LRB- R -RRB- , HOUSE SPEAKER : And one of them will win . \nPARKER : Is that ever on your agenda ? \nBOEHNER : Oh , no , no. . \nNo , no , no , no , no. . \nI decided a long time ago I never really wanted to be governor . \nAnd I really did n't want to be senator . \nSo I decided all right the rest of my political career is going to be in the U.S. House . \nI thought I 'd be here about 10 years and go back and run my business or go do something else . \nBut here it is , I 've been here 20 . \nBut I decided a long time ago that the rest of my career was going to be in the House . \nMy goal ought to be to be the speaker . \nShoot for the top you 'll never get there . \nPARKER : What do you want your stamp to be when you leave as speaker ? \nBOEHNER : I want to have an institution that truly represents the will of the American people . \nAnd I want to have a process in place where no leader in the future can turn the clock back and take control away from the members . \nPARKER : All right . \nWell , thank you so much , Speaker Boehner . \nSPITZER : When we come back , from Maine to Mississippi , another winter storm blasts the East Coast . \nBundle up and stay tuned . \nSPITZER : The northeast is slammed with another winter storm . \nWarnings have now been issued from Maine to Mississippi . \nParts of the northeast could see more than 10 inches of snow tonight and this is just after digging out from a blizzard earlier this month . \nTake a look at the picture outside the building here . \nYou can see , well , maybe if you look carefully , wind and snow blowing through Central Park . \nGorgeous view unless you 're stuck outside . \nAnd then take another picture . \nThis is the White House . \nSnow continues to fall there . \nMore than 40,000 people , unfortunately , without power in Philadelphia . \nIf you 're trying to fly out of Philadelphia right now , this is what it looks like , does n't look like too many planes are taking off . \nAnd here 's the view from Boston where they could get close to a foot of snow . \nOh , my goodness , just what the kids want . \nParents not too happy about it . \nMeteorologist Bonnie Schneider joins us with the latest . \nBonnie , what 's going on right now ? \nBONNIE SCHNEIDER , AMS METEOROLOGIST : Well , Eliot , the storm is certainly not over yet . \nWe 're watching our radar picture that shows a lot of snow sweeping through the mid-Atlantic and then on up into New England . \nAt times it 's been mixing with sleet and turning slushy making for a real mess out there . \nNotice the change over here on Long Island , for example , where the warmer air is coming in . \nAnd then back to the south and to the east , we 're seeing some more snow build in . \nSo it 's going to be cold enough to see that changeover overnight . \nThe temperatures right over parts of Pennsylvania into the low 30s and then in the 40s along the Jersey Shore . \nThat 's where you 're seeing some really heavy thunderstorms mixing in with sleet at times . \nJust really a treacherous situation out there . \nThe question is what happens now as we go forward ? \nLet 's take a look at the storm track and we 'll advance it on end . \nAnd what you 'll find is that the storm is working its way to the north and east in a classic nor'easter sense . \nIt 's kind of sliding up the coastline . \nIt will be off the coast of New York by early tomorrow morning . \nKind of in the overnight hours when we expect some really heavy snow to pile up and then it advances further to the east . \nIt 's a fast-moving storm . \nSo we actually could have seen even more snow with this system but it 's going to dump some heavy amounts . \nFour to six inches for Washington . \nEight inches to a foot in New York . \nEight inches to a foot in Boston . \nAnd , of course , there 's always the risk for isolated higher amounts . \nOther thing to note that 's really important is the temperatures . \nAnd right around the 30s . \nSo it 's not that cold where we 're seeing light fluffy snow . \nWe 're seeing big flakes , wet heavy snow . \nThis is going to be dangerous tomorrow , Eliot , for people that are trying to shovel out because the snow will be heavy and tough to maneuver . \nSPITZER : You know , Bonnie , real quick , before time runs out . \nAre there more storms like this coming ? \nIt seems like every week we 're getting another one . \nMy kids are never going to school . \nSnow holidays every day . \nIs this just me imagining this , or is this for real ? \nSCHNEIDER : No , you are not imagining it at all . \nBecause when you look at cities like Philadelphia and New York and even in Boston and Syracuse , we are way above normal for this time of year . \nAlready in New York , over 27 inches of snow . \nFor this date for the winter , the normal by this time would be 9.3 inches . \nAnd remember coming up , February is the snowiest month of the year . \nSo we have a lot more ahead . \nSPITZER : All right , something to look forward to . \nBonnie Schneider , thank you . \nAnd thank you all so much for being with us tonight . \nGood night from New York . \nI 'm Eliot Spitzer . \n`` PIERS MORGAN TONIGHT '' starts right now . \n"}
{"id": "100", "time": "2011-01-26", "text": "Analysis : U.S. stuck between support and concern in the Middle East January 26 , 2011 | By Elise Labott , CNN 's Senior State Department Producer Two weeks ago in Qatar , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton warned Arab leaders that if they failed to address the desperation , poverty and lack of political freedoms in their countries and build a better future for their people , their regimes would sink into the sand . \nNow , across the region , Arab populations are beginning to voice social and economic frustrations and assert their democratic rights . \nIt puts the United States in the unenviable position of wanting and needing to support those yearnings at the same time the regimes they have long relied on for security in the region are the targets . \nThe United States was completely caught off guard and largely absent from the scene in Tunisia . \nThe State Department expressed some early concern about the free flow of information and the Tunisian goverment 's crackdown on the protesters , urging respect for their right to freedom of expression . \nBut it did n't voice strong support for the protesters aspirations until President Ben Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali had already fled the country . \nIn a carefully crafted statement , Clinton urged the caretaker government to respect the rights of the people assembling in the streets and to heed their call for political , social and economic reform . \nEgyptians , emboldened by the success of their Tunisian brothers , followed on the streets of Cairo Tuesday to protest the corruption and failed economic policies of President Hosni Mubarak . \nOnce again , Clinton measured her words Tuesday morning . \nBut she offered at least tepid support of the Egyptian government , calling it `` stable '' and `` looking for ways to respond to the legitimate needs and interests of the Egyptian people . '' \nWhile the chances of an overnight `` revolution , '' is far less likely in Egypt than in Tunisia , the consequences for the United States would be far more dire should that happen in Egypt . \nBen Ali provided significant cooperation to the United States in its campaign against terrorism , but his ouster is relatively inconsequential to U.S. national security interests . \nMubarak , however , is a key U.S. ally whose help is critical in maintaining security in the region on every issue from helping to forge peace between Israelis and Palestinians to continuing to keep pressure on Iran to stabilizing Lebanon and Iraq . \nHis continued failure to heed the calls of his people could ultimately become a national security issue for the United States . \n"}

'' \n`` I could tell he was speaking from a phone booth , the line was quite crackly . \nI was shocked , and had to listen to it again before the message sunk in , '' Potts told the Daily Mail . \n`` I think he probably dialed incorrectly , and that his girlfriend s number is similar to mine . '' \nUnless Samantha or the soldier come forth after reports of the call were splashed across the British press Wednesday , it could be awhile before the soldier can make his pitch again . \n`` He said he would not be able to ring for another month , and would not be home for another three months , '' Potts told the Daily Mail . \nIn the 90-second message , the soldier also talks about losing a comrade in recent fighting . \n`` One of my guys has just been blown up , so I feel sad , I really feel sad , '' he says on the tape . \nSamantha is also apparently pregnant . \n`` I can t wait until you give birth to my baby , my little soldier , '' the soldier says . \n`` I will do everything in my heart and I will try my hardest to fight to protect you . '' \nThen he 's back to the fight . \n`` I 've got to go back out here now . \nI love you with all my heart , do n't ever forget that , I love you , all right Samantha , I love you , bye , bye , '' the phone message ends . \nPotts says she hopes Samantha and the soldier connect soon , according to reports . \n`` I e-mailed the media to see if anybody could pick it up and do something about , '' she told Sky News Online . \n`` He had a regional accent , but we 're not sure if he lives up here , so it 's great to get coverage and find her . \n`` We just really want to find her . '' \nReview of Obama 's speech -- If you missed President Barack Obama 's speech to the nation Tuesday night , here 's a full transcript and video . \nThe president touched on many familiar themes , and CNN 's iReporters tried to sum up all his points in a single tweet . \nHow about the `` economy '' ? \nObama said it 's headed in the right direction but the country 's priorities should change , especially when it comes to spending . \nThe president called for increasing investments in key areas such as education and clean energy , but he also wants to make reductions in spending to help get America 's deficit under control and proposed a five-year domestic spending freeze . \nDuring another portion of the speech , he highlighted a small-business owner , describing the man 's story as a symbol of the American dream . \nObama also spoke of U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords , who is recovering from a gunshot wound to the head after a gunman 's rampage at a political meet-and-greet this month in Tucson , Arizona . \nThe congresswoman 's name was met with applause . \nOn Wednesday , the president will take his message on the road , discussing opportunities for job growth in clean energy during a stop in Wisconsin . \nShe s called the queen of rockabilly , has secured a place in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame , and at age 73 she s teamed up with rocker Jack White to release a new album . \nWhite , a founder of the White Stripes , produced and arranged Jackson s new album , The Party Ain t Over , a disc bringing Jackson s growling country-style vocals to rock tunes . \nBut she says White s work quickly won her over . \nI realized he wasn t wanting to change my style of singing at all . \nHe just wanted me to have new , fresher material . \nHe just wanted more of Wanda than I was used to putting out , she says . \nJackson belted out Funnel of Love , with White on guitar , and then Conan asked Jackson about what it was like to tour with the king of rock 'n' roll , Elvis Presley , 50 years ago . \nThey did more than tour , White interjected . \nHe could sure kiss good was all Jackson offered . \nThis was the seventh case . \nIt 's been two years since the disappearance of Adji Desir , but police have not given up hope to find the boy alive . \nPolice marked the second anniversary on January 10 by knocking on doors and distributing updated fliers with the then 6-year-old 's smiling face . \nA large triangle image on the fliers highlights what police aim to do by building a triangle of trust between residents of the Immokalee village , Adji 's parents and law enforcement . \nDid someone see something when the developmentally disabled boy vanished while playing outside his grandmother 's home with friends ? \nCarnival Triumph cruise ship that experienced fire in engine room being towed to Mobile , AL instead of Mexico #CNN Could the next pope be from Africa or Latin America ? \nie\\/11BX93W 7:01 pm ET February 11 , 2013 RETWEET Could the next pope be from Africa or Latin America ? \nly\\/U6vgfT 6:30 pm ET February 11 , 2013 RETWEET Looking for a good car for bad winter weather ? \nCheck these out : cnnmon . \n"}

{"id": "152", "time": "2011-02-01", "text": "Protesters seek representative government , economic opportunity A young man in Tunisia sparked waves of protests in several countries Many protesters are young , unemployed , middle-class A Human Rights Watch researcher says more than 120 have died -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As the protests in Cairo enter a second week , CNN takes a look at some of the key questions surrounding them . \nWhat are the protests about ? \nThe protesters are calling for democratization -- for a government that they feel represents them . \nThey want President Hosni Mubarak , 82 , to step down after 30 years holding onto power , and an end to what they complain is a corrupt regime . \nSome have called for the government to face a trial . \nThe anger is driven largely by economic frustrations . \nEgypt has seen a dramatic rise in the cost of living in recent years . \nWhile the government has offered food subsidies to help people handle rising prices , many are struggling . \nEgypt 's economy was stagnant for decades , but in the past 10 years started to grow , creating bigger differences between rich and poor , said Juan Cole , a Middle East historian at the University of Michigan . \nWhere does U.S. go from here with Egypt ? \nPress & protests : Egypt cuts internet Why now ? \nWhat sparked the protests ? \nA wave of protests in nearby Tunisia which overthrew the government helped inspire people in other nearby countries , facing similar frustrations , that it was time for an uprising . \nBut the spark , in many ways , was one young man . \nMohamed Bouazizi , a 26-year-old college graduate in Tunisia , was unable to find work , so he set up a fruit cart . \nPolice confiscated it , saying he had no permit . \nAccording to the Federation of Human Rights Leagues , police also beat him . \nBouazizi set himself on fire in protest , and later died . \nHis self-immolation triggered the huge protests in Tunisia , which in turn helped inspire people in other nearby countries , including Algeria and Yemen , to take to the streets as well . \nThere have also been protests in Jordan and Sudan . \nA Facebook page calls for similar demonstrations in Syria . \nA popular Facebook page that helped organize the Cairo protests beginning January 25 was dedicated to Bouazizi . \nMany are young men . \nThe majority of Egypt 's population is under 30 , and the vast majority of its unemployed are as well . \nWhile the protesters include people from different socio-economic levels and different parts of the country , there is a `` high proportion of the educated middle class , '' said Cole . \nThere 's `` a feeling amongst that middle class that they 're not being given the opportunities in life that their degrees warrant -- what historians would call a ` blocked elite , ' '' Cole said . \nHave the protests been violent ? \nThe protesters have generally been peaceful , chanting slogans and holding signs . \nLast week , police clashed violently with some demonstrators , leaving some dead and others wounded . \nOnce the government sent in the military to take the place of police , the clashes came to a halt . \nThe two sides have generally gotten along well . \nSome protesters have even posed for pictures with members of the military on their tanks . \nAt times , the protests have even taken on the feeling of a music festival , with people wandering around , chatting , and celebrating . \n`` This is the start of the rest of my life , '' one jubilant young man who appeared to be in his 20s told CNN . \n`` As cheesy as it sounds , that 's exactly how I feel right now . '' \nHow did chaos begin in some areas ? \nPolice disappeared from the streets in parts of Cairo and some other areas , and some police stations were ransacked . \nOver the weekend , looters attacked stores and homes and torched some cars , and some prisoners escaped . \nMen gathered in neighborhoods to create vigilante groups protecting their property . \nIn some places , people handed out knives , sticks , clubs , and baseball bats to men and teenage boys , encouraging them to fight any looters who came along . \nSome Egyptians said they worry the chaos could be part of Mubarak 's strategy , getting citizens angry at the protesters for creating havoc and excited for government security forces to come along and bring order . \nBut the crime has also built more frustration against the government among many Egyptians . \nWhile it 's difficult to ascertain a solid death toll , Human Rights Watch staffers have confirmed more than 120 deaths in Cairo , Alexandria , and Suez , according to a researcher for the group in Cairo . \nHow is the food supply ? \nMany families are fast running out of staples , and they are either unable or unwilling to shop for groceries . \n`` I have three children , and I only have enough to feed them for maybe two more days . \nAfter that I do not know what we will do , '' school administrator Gamalat Gadalla said . \nGrocers have closed up shop or are running out of supplies themselves . \n`` With the curfew , there are no restaurants , food or gas . \nBasic goods will soon be in shortage , '' Sandmonkey , an Egyptian blogger said via Twitter . \nEgyptian state-run Nile TV has set up a hotline for citizens to call in and report bread shortages . \nThere has been no other indication of what the Egyptian government is doing to address the crisis . \nCNN 's Ben Wedeman , Nic Robertson , Ivan Watson , Frederik Pleitgen , and Salma Abdelaziz contributed to this report . \n"}

'' \nUnlike the judge who ruled the individual mandate unconstitutional last month , the federal judge in Florida , U.S. District Judge Robert Vinson , ruled that the unconstitutionality voided the entire act . \nSo what does this mean for your health care coverage today ? \nTuesday on `` American Morning , '' CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin explained how the law stands today . \nHe described what parts of the law the judge ruled unconstitutional , why it may be the most far-reaching ruling yet , and what happens next . \nThe scenes in Egypt have been dramatic , as thousands turn out onto the streets demanding that President Hosni Mubarak resign after 30 years in power . \nFew images have been more powerful than those of demonstrators dropping to the ground to pray in the face of security forces . \nAnd while some have been inspired by the role of religious faith in the protests , there are definite worries that the banned Muslim Brotherhood is waiting in the wings , hoping for a chance to take over . \nThe Muslim Brotherhood has been part of the political scene in Egypt for more than 80 years and advocates a move away from secularism and a return to the rules of the Quran . \nIt 's the oldest and largest opposition group in Egypt and is illegal under Egyptian law . \nAnd while the Brotherhood officially rejects the use of violent means to secure its goals , offshoots of the group have been linked to attacks in the past . \nCNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank has met with top leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood . \nToday on `` American Morning , '' he gave his analysis on the Muslim Brotherhood 's current role in Egypt . \nCruickshank explains to AM 's TJ Holmes why many are concerned about their influence and how their role in Egypt affects al Qaeda . \nSnow falls on the Cloud Gate sculpture in Chicago 's Millennium Park . \nA massive snowstorm is raging across the U.S. heartland . \nThe weather will affect areas from New England to New Mexico , and travelers should brace for as many as four days of serious storm conditions , said CNN meteorologist Rob Marciano . \nTravel will probably be difficult if not impossible in many areas , the National Weather Service warns . \nShare your snow images with CNN iReport . \nFollow @CNNTravel on Twitter for the latest updates . \n-LRB- Update 11 p.m. ET -RRB- Blizzard warnings were up Tuesday night in eight states -

{"id": "88", "time": "2011-02-01", "text": "Interview with CEO of PIMCO ; Interview with Executive Chairman of Orascom Aired February 1 , 2011 - 14:00:00 ET THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT . \nRICHARD QUEST , HOST , QUEST MEANS BUSINESS : A dramatic development out of Egypt . \nPresident Mubarak , as you have just heard , reportedly bowing to protestors ; stepping down at the next election . \nWe will report on that , during this hour , if it happens . \nOn the business agenda , a blockage in the pipeline . \nBP 's Rosneft deal is held back . \nAnd also , tonight , a commissioner from the EU , as the EU lights a spark under business . \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : Open for business in Europe , or we 're out of business . \nAs you have already heard , just in the cuts , and a short while ago , we are hearing reports that President Hosni Mubarak will step down at the next election , later this year . \nAl Arabiya television network says the president is going to make the announcement in a speech . \nNow , we are watching of course everything that happens in Egypt at the moment . \nAnd if and when that speech takes place we will bring it to you immediately . \nThe people of Egypt are out in force , or at least tens of thousands of them . \nThey are in unprecedented numbers on the streets . \nAnd they are demanding that President Mubarak must leave . \nAt this hour , it is 9:00 o'clock in Cairo and many thousands remain in the city 's Tahrir Square . \nAgain , they are defying a curfew , standing together and chanting slogans or praying . \nThe longer this goes on the greater the damage that is being done to Egypt 's credibility in the international financial markets . \nS&P , Standards & Poor 's has cut the country 's credit rating down to double B. And signaled it could fall further if the unrest continues . \nMoody 's , you know , downgraded Egypt on Monday . \nMohamed El-Erian is the chief executive of PIMCO , which is the world 's largest bond firm . \nAnd bond fund , in terms of trading . \nI asked him how this plays out for investors in Egypt ? \nMOHAMED EL-ERIAN , CEO , PIMCO : It is important to do what we call tail scenarios , to assume what can happen . \nYou do n't always get it right , but it gets you into a mindset of reacting . \nMost of the time , Richard , the battle is won or lost not in terms of anticipating every development , but in terms of reacting to every development . \nAnd you have to develop what we call , here , a concept of constructive paranoia . \nYou have to be worried , but you have to be worried in a constructive manner . \nIt is very important to ask the `` what if '' question and to ask something that investors around the world do n't ask themselves enough , is what mistake can I afford to make and what mistake can I not afford to make ? \nQUEST : In that scenario with so many unknowns , not least of which will President Mubarak finally relinquish power ? \nIf he does relinquish power , what comes next ? \nNot to say the least , the Muslim Brotherhood and a variety of unknown factors , how do you answer those very questions , then ? \nEL-ERIAN : I say that we have to play both defense and offense . \nOn the defense side , you have to make sure that you are well-enough positioned to be able to absorb a negative shock . \nOn the offense side , you have to be able to exploit other people 's indiscriminate selling , or indiscriminate buying . \nWhen we look at Egypt , Richard , we see things starting to come together . \nWe see the opposition talking within itself , and developing a forward looking agenda . \nWe see more willingness on the part of the governments to interact with the opposition and we see the army , which is a very respected institution , and liked in Egypt , playing a constructive role . \nSo put all this together , there is a slow process of reconciliation of very different views about what managed change looks like in Egypt today . \nQUEST : If we then go beyond the Egyptian shores , and we look , for example , at oil . \nLet 's just take this-you know , this very-this incident has shoved oil up to $ 100 and the danger is it creates a floor at that level . \nIt is also had an impact in U.S. Treasury bond markets , as well , the flight to safety , the dollar . \nSo , we ca n't just simply isolate it can we , to Egypt and the surroundings ? \nEL-ERIAN : We can not and should not . \nSo , we should look for the following . \nThere will be a permanent one-time increase in commodity prices . \nPeople now recognize geopolitical shock is more of an issue . \nAnd importantly other countries that are looking at Egypt will want to stock pile many more commodities in order to avoid what is happening in Egypt in terms of food inflation . \nSo this will put pressure up on the commodities . \nOn the dollar and Treasuries , what is really interesting to us , Richard , is not what happened , but what did not happen . \nWhat did not happen is a major strengthening of the dollar , what did not happen is a major increase in bond prices . \nAnd this addressed to us , that the U.S. not longer plays the same role in terms of flight to quality that it once did . \nQUEST : That is a huge suggestion , is it not , that if the U.S. , if the Treasury , the long bond , and the dollar is to some extent not a sensitive on geopolitical crisis ? \nThen frankly we have to rethink a lot of our fundamental thinking , do n't we ? \nEL-ERIAN : Richard , we have to think a lot of our fundamental thinking , because , we , as a society , as a global society , are going through some major realignments . \nWe have , as a society , gone through a financial crisis that has changed facts on the ground . \nStarting with the U.S. deficit and debt situation , and we are seeing an accelerated migration of growth and wealth dynamics between countries . \nSo this is a very exciting time . \nBut it is a time also where people have to have open mindset to recognize that we are on this bumpy journey to something different . \nQUEST : Mohamed El-Erian , the chief executive of PIMCO . \nOne of the largest bond funds in the world , if not the largest , and talking to me earlier from California . \nThe markets and how they have responded ? \nWell , the U.S. markets , to some extent - - holding their own . \nWell , more than that . \nIt even takes me as a bit of a surprise when you look at it , and you suddenly see , whoosh ! \nUp like a rocket . \nUp 138 , we are now over 12,030 . \nSome encouraging numbers from UPS , some better than expected economic data . \nNone of which is terribly exciting , but it certainly gave the market the direction that it needed to go off like a roman candle . \n138 points , over 12,000 for the moment , on the Dow Jones industrials . \nNow , some might argue it is just not BP 's day . \nThe oil company has been slapped with a court order , its shares have hit a snag in London . \nAnd it posted its first annual loss in a generation . \nIf that is not enough , you 'll hear from the chief in a moment . \nQUEST : Now , then , an update on our main story . \nWe are hearing reports that President Hosni Mubarak will step down at the next presidential election , in September . \nAl Arabiya television network says that Mubarak is going to make in a speech . \nNow , when that happens , well , we are believing and we are told , and we are thinking it could be within the next hour or so . \nThe people of Egypt , or at least those that are protesting are out in force and they are there in unprecedented numbers . \nIf , when , and how , President Mubarak speaks , you will hear it here , on CNN . \nBP tonight is figuring out its next move after a London court blocked its planned deal with Russia 's Rosneft . \nThe investors also sent BP shares lower in London . \nThat was a response to the oil giant 's latest results . \nBut before one gets too necessarily worried or exciting-exciting , I should say-bear in mind where BP has come from to get to where it is now , especially after the Macondo incident . \nCome over here , and I will brief you , in the library . \nBP-Rosneft , this is a deal they are wanting to do . \nBut , of course , BP 's own subsidiary in-or the owners of , the partners TNK BP , they have been to the royal courts of justice , to get an injunction , but it is a temporary one . \nTo stop this while , of course the full hearing is taking place . \nIt is temporary injunction . \nBP believes , of course , that it would like , in some way , to do a deal with Rosneft and with TNK . \nAnd it said it is trying to fast-track those discussions . \nBP , itself , had a loss in 2010 of 4.6 billion . \nNow that is a first loss for the company in the best part of 20 years . \nIt was the charges that have been set aside , for the Macondo spill , not only of course a trust fund but also the losses , the clean up , everything else . \nBecause the trust fund , of course , is paid over many years , where as the clean up costs were draining outright , at the moment . \nIt 's $ 4.6 billion loss in ' 10 . \nHowever , BP does say it will pay 7 cents a share in Q4 of ' 10 . \nDividends were suspended as part of the whole noise and furor during the Gulf of Mexico spill . \nMany people believe the suspension of dividends was purely a political move . \nBP certainly has the cash reserves to continue . \nAlthough , there are some suggestions in `` Fortune '' last magazine article that the preservation of capital was crucial for BP in those early days of the crisis . \nJim Boulden is with me . \nI went off on a tangent there . \nJIM BOULDEN , CNN FINANCIAL CORRESPONDENT : That 's fine . \nIt 's a good article . \nQUEST : Yes , it is . \nIt is a very good article . \nOh , yes , back to BP . \nBOULDEN : Very , very complicated , is n't it ? \nBut what struck me in the 90 minute briefing that the CEO Bob Dudley gave today , to the press here in London , he is completely relaxed about this . \nAt least he gives that demeanor . \nHe says the court injunction , he said it before it happened . \nBut he kind of anticipated it would happen . \nHe said it is a time out . \nIt just delays a little bit of what is going on , this deal between . \nAnd he says , very likely that whatever agreement comes out of all of this will be a fast track negotiation and it could be that TNK BP do get into the deal . \nQUEST : Is he trying to-look , I do n't understand this . \nQUEST : So he 's not trying to - BOULDEN : They do n't do the same thing . \nQUEST : Right , but is he trying to ditch TNK BP ? \nBOULDEN : No , no. . \nBecause they do n't do these same thing . \nQUEST : So why is TNK BP all upset about Rosneft ? \nBOULDEN : They think that they had this deal since 2004 , that anything BP can do in Russia that they should have a little bit of it . \nIt 's that simple . \nQUEST : Because the one thing I do know about litigation , is that where money is at stake , an agreement is usually found , because people do n't really want to litigate it to the nth degree . \nAnd that is why I think this fast-track negotiation that Bob Dudley wants is probably where we are going to go . \nBecause you go to court , because that certainly quickens the mind , does n't it ? \nSo then you get to the idea of where , OK , what can you give . \nWhat kind of stake can you give BP TNK into this ? \nQUEST : I need to just need to throw one unfair question at you . \nQUEST : Have n't given you notice about it , but you are well across the BP barometer . \nThere losses this year , this $ 4 billion loss . \nIt does n't really account for the full cost of the trust fund that they have had to put together . \nQUEST : That will be dribbled out over 20 odd years . \nQUEST : But , BP , why are they paying a dividend again , then ? \nBOULDEN : Because they got $ 17 billion of cash in , the bank , in 2010 because they sold assets . \nThat is not from oil . \nThey put $ 17 billion-they are going to get $ 30 billion , they think , by the end of 2011 . \nAnd that $ 17 billion is already in the bank . \nSo they are able to be confident enough , the board , to start getting the shareholders back on their side , if you will . \nThe BP dividend , back on the books . \nJim , many thanks , indeed . \nComing up , you adapt , or you die . \nA sobering message in the world of business , but in New York we 'll hear that from Richard Braddock , who extols the virtues of the Internet . \nIn Hong Kong , it will be Michael Wu , with a coffee culture . \nIt is `` The Boss '' after the break . \nQUEST : I need to remind you of our top story tonight . \nEgypt 's President Hosni Mubarak will reportedly step down , at the next election . \nThe Al Arabiya television network says President Mubarak is going to make the announcement in a speech . \nIt is expected within the next hour . \nYou can be assured , of course , when it happens . \nYou will hear about it here on CNN . \nOK , now we turn our attention : He was told that it would n't work . \nThat was a risk that Michael Wu took when he brought the world 's biggest coffee chain to Hong Kong . \nIn New York , Richard Braddock tells us tonight being a chief exec can be a very lonely place . \nAs you can tell , the decisions , the trails , the tribulations , they are all about being `` The Boss '' . \nMICHAEL WU , CEO , MAXIM 'S GROUP : It 's great when the staff sees that the company shares the same values which they do . \nRICHARD BRADDOCK , CEO , FRESH DIRECT : I think it is going to have a major impact on our business going forward . \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : I 'd now like to introduce our final session of the day , entitled , Serving Your Customer Better : Using the Internet To Your Advantage , '' and given by Rick Braddock . \nBRADDOCK : Thank you . \nNice to be here together , with all of you . \nAnd this audience does n't intimidate him . \nBRADDOCK : As we meet here today , there is probably little doubt that the Internet deserves to be in everyone 's plans , regardless of what they sell . \nIt is not only a high growth medium , but also can be a transformative one as well . \nIn many ways they help him map out the future for FreshDirect . \nBRADDOCK : What I write down in the speech is my freshest thinking on how to run the business better . \nSo it gives me a chance to sharpen my strategic wit . \nBRADDOCK : Most of us are not using the Internet to its fullest capabilities in pursuing e-commerce sales . \nBRADDOCK : Your customer gives you that deep knowledge of themselves so that you can be prepared to serve them more effectively on their return . \nBRADDOCK : I sort of like to tweak people from the old ways and in a little bit of a philosophical sense , say , you know , get on with it . \nThis is a new world . \nAnd if you do n't get acquainted with it you are not going to serve your customers the way others will do . \nBRADDOCK : Our average orders in New York is $ 120 , out in Westchester it is $ 160 , and the Hamptons it is $ 250 . \nIf you really look at this business analytically when a customer tries you , one of two things happen . \nThey either trend toward loyalty and become one of those , you know , e - commerce darlings . \nOr , they go away . \nBRADDOCK : OK , we 're out of questions ? \nOK , well , thank you . \nBRADDOCK : Being a CEO can be a very lonely place . \nThat usually happens when your business is n't doing too well . \nOr it can be a very happy place , and that happens when your business is doing well . \nSo , right now , with our business growing at 25 percent , I 'm pretty happy to be a CEO . \nWU -LRB- speaking Chinese , English Subtitles -RRB- : Welcome to coffee tasting today . \nWU -LRB- speaking Chinese , English Subtitles -RRB- : Edwin , you 're the host of the tasting today . \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE -LRB- speaking Chinese , English Subtitles -RRB- : When we started , 70 to 80 percent of our customers were tourists . \nNow they make up 50 percent . \nWU : They were actually selling much more than just coffee . \nThey were selling a lifestyle . \nWU : Hong Kong does not have a coffee culture . \nThere is only a tea culture in Hong Kong . \nAnd a lot of people tell me that it wo n't work . \nIt was n't always easy , though . \nWith the foreign brand came new challenges . \nHow to integrate local Hong Kong culture without weakening the Starbucks brand . \nWU : We have actually changed a lot of the ways that the customer perceives Starbucks in Hong Kong . \nFor example , our food program , I think we are one of the very few , if not the only market , which actually makes our own food . \nSo we can make very locally relevant foods , such as egg tarts , such as , curry puffs , such as sausage rolls . \nWU : We have learned that we can actually grow the market . \nWe can educate our customers , and locations where we would never have thought would have been successful 10 years ago , are some of our highest grossing stores now . \nAnd in London , Sarah Curran prepares for the re-launch of My-Wardrobe . \nQUEST : Now , if you would like to be considered , or if you a chief exec who would like to be considered to be part of our `` The Boss '' , then please drop me an e-mail . \nThe e-mail address Quest @ CNN.com . \nWe 're looking for applicants When we come back , the Internet does n't work , the shops are shut and you have n't been able to get any money out of the cash machine , you are also head of Egypt 's biggest telecom company . \nThe head of Orascom , the executive chairman , about how he 's doing business , at the moment . \nQUEST : Hello , I 'm Richard Quest , QUEST MEANS BUSINESS . \nAnd on this network , the news always comes first . \nAnd we 're learning the embattled Egyptian president , Hosni Mubarak , is expected to address his country later tonight , as tens of thousands of anti-government protesters still fill Cairo 's Tahrir Square . \nAl-Arabiya television network is reporting that Mr. Mubarak will announce he will not run for another term as president . \nIn addition , `` The New York Times '' is reporting that President Obama has told Mr. Mubarak that he should not run for another term in the election in the fall , effectively withdrawing American support for its closest Arab ally . \nThere 's been a big shake-up in Jordan on the heels of the series of public protests last month . \nKing Abdullah has dissolved the government and named a new prime minister . \nMarouf Al Bakhit served as prime minister before . \nHe 's also been a military adviser to the king . \nElsewhere , in Australia , the flood-dividend Queens -- state of Queensland is bracing for more bad weather . \nA category four cyclone is heading toward its coast . \nHundreds of residents in Cairns are being told to evacuate their homes and take sensible precautions . \nThe storm is expected to make landfall there shortly . \nSo , we are currently waiting for President Mubarak to speak about his future in Europe . \nBut it 's becoming increasingly tricky to do business in the country . \nThe Internet is partially blocked out , shops have been closed for days . \nActivists call for workers all over the country to walk out , as on strike a part of these protests . \nAnd even those who did go to work were faced with a countrywide curfew that started in mid-afternoon . \nThis is some of the things that are happening in Egypt at the moment . \nBP is pulling its families and its staff out . \nA hundred and ninety - nine people flew to the U.K. . \nLast night and more could follow . \nBP 's chief exec says drilling is slowing down because of what 's happening . \nProduction , though , has not been affected . \nProcter & Gamble , P&G , says it 's closed its general office in Cairo and two plants on the outskirts of the city . \nNow , the Cairo office may be closed , it 's told its staff to work from home and stay safe with their families . \nCoca-Cola also closed its office in Cairo , says that it wo n't reopen until the situation is more secure . \nIt also says , not surprisingly , that it 's taking all necessary measures to ensure the safety of staff . \nAnd Volkswagen says it has stopped making deliveries to Egypt . \nFellow car maker G.M. Says people and plant are safe . \nIt will commence normal operations when conditions permit . \nThat 's the scenario of what is happening with some of the major companies . \nNaguib Sawiris is the executive chairman of Orascom Technology , Egypt 's largest mobile phone network . \nAnd he joins me on the line now . \nGood evening to you , sir . \nLet us begin with what -- what -- do you have anything you can add to our understanding , perhaps , of President Mubarak stepping down or saying he wo n't run again ? \nNAGUIB SAWIRIS , EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN , ORASCOM : I just listened to the news just as you . \nI mean it was in Al-Arabiya and now it has not been confirmed by the Egyptian television , which should be the official channel . \nSo we are not really sure whether this is true or not . \nQUEST : Let 's talk , then , business , while we wait and see , because , obviously , the politics will take care of itself . \nFirst of all , with -- you are a mobile operator and we do know that the mobile network has been closed down at various times or at least been ordered to be shut down . \nWhat is your understanding of all of this ? \nSAWIRIS : Well , look , we are an operator who has a license and we need to adhere to whatever the government tells us , because our license says that the government has the right to request us to close some of the services at their own discretion , you know , and when there is any crisis in the country . \nAnd I -- and we have to obey , otherwise we are risking losing our license , you know . \nSo we already adhered to that . \nPersonally , I believe that this , right now , there is no need whatsoever to close down the Internet or the SMS anymore because they were worried that the demonstrators will gather and meet and so on . \nThey 're already there . \nThey 're in the -- there is a million people in the middle of downtown Cairo . \nThey 're staying there and they 're going nowhere until their demands have been met . \nSo I do n't see any sense in that , because we are all now sitting in our homes without any work . \nWe ca n't go to our offices because of the curfew and because of the lack of Internet . \nThere 's no correspondence , no communication ... SAWIRIS : -- so I think it 's not a very wise situation . \nQUEST : I mean , when you start , you know , when -- when President Mubarak 's officials say to you , shut off the Internet , shut down the -- the mobile phone network , you obviously have to follow a legal instruction , but do you do so sort of under protest ? \nSAWIRIS : Of course we do that under protest . \nI mean I -- I do n't even share the wisdom of that decision . \nRight now , I believe it 's best to let the Internet back because we will hear more of -- of the young people 's wishes and demands . \nAnd we are able to resolve the deadlock we have now . \nI mean the situation now , we are in a deadlock . \nSAWIRIS : Demonstrators are saying we wo n't negotiate until he leaves and -- and the president is not leaving . \nAnd then -- and sensible people like us are saying , OK , he leaves and then what ? \nWhat 's the -- who 's going to run the country ? \nI mean there is no solution on the table to ask a man like that to ... QUEST : -- let me just ask you to give -- but then if that is the case , do you think some sort of halfway house -- and I -- and I know I 'm asking you to speculate , but do you think some halfway house where Mubarak says I 'll go in September but that gives us time to put in place a process , do you -- is that acceptable to someone like you ? \nSAWIRIS : Well , I think it 's acceptable to someone like him . \nWe want the streets to be -- it to be acceptable to them . \nRight now , I believe that the street has put itself in a deadlock , you know . \nFirst of all , I must say that I commend President Mubarak for not fleeing away like Ben Ali did . \nYou know , he is a military man . \nHe 's a man who has been facing -- he faced wars and enemies . \nHe is not going to flee the country and leave , you know ? \nSo I believe -- I urge -- I urge the demonstrators to be reasonable in their demand and to allow a transition period . \nI believe that the president has the safety of the country in his eyes and would like to leave honestly -LRB- ph -RRB- ... SAWIRIS : And he -- he will be willing to do that if he sees that the country is put in good hands . \nQUEST : -- what -- what ... SAWIRIS : -- what we are -- sensible people like myself and others are trying to even broker now , if we can . \nQUEST : As you say , you 're trying to broker , let me just ask you , finally and briefly , how much damage is being done , do you believe , to your business and to the Egyptian economy by what 's taking place ? \nI know , politics aside , and I know there are greater issues at stake , but if we just look at it from the bigger -- from the business perspective ? \nSAWIRIS : I -- I believe we -- we 've lost all the growth of GDP this year . \nThat 's gone away . \nSo if there was a 600 -LRB- ph -RRB- percent anticipated , I think we 'll see the same in minus , you know . \nThe other problem we have is there is that 'll stagnation . \nSAWIRIS : There is no traffic , no transportation . \nThe factories are not running because the laborers can not reach the factories . \nThe raw materials are not reaching , the products are not being distributed . \nIn a few days , we will run out of fuel , food and everything . \nIt 's a. . . \nQUEST : Indeed , many thanks , indeed , the chair -- the executive chairman of Orascom joining us -- joining us on the line there shortly . \nNow we join CNN USA and John King . \n"}
{"id": "233", "time": "2011-02-01", "text": "Get To Know Piers Morgan Tonight : Donny Deutsch Guest Hosts This evening `` Piers Morgan Tonight '' welcomes the return of Donny Deutsch , as the brand guru is back for a fourth stint as guest host When Piers asked if Blair thinks Mubarak should stay in power until elections and not leave immediately , Blair would n't answer directly , but said , `` whatever happens , frankly , there 's going to be change . \nAnd that change will happen reasonably quickly . '' \nAlso , there was this exchange about it being `` over '' : MORGAN : If you do n't have world leaders telling him publicly it 's over , are n't you going to create a - a vacuum and a void here into which the extremists could well come ? \nBLAIR : Well , it is over , in the sense that whatever we 're talking about , we 're talking about a period of transition until we get to elections . \nI really like your show and your doing a great job . \nBut please quit saying in every interview the you playing devils advocate . \nIt dosent sound good when you say it in every interview . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 9:47 am | Report abuse | I watch CNN 24\\/7 , and in every country I go to , it is the first thing I turn on to feel at home . \nI never noticed anything about an interviewer before , like I have noticed that Piers cuts of his guests , in the middle of sentences - like a friend that is thinking about what they are going to say next while you are still talking . \nIt is so frustrating to listen to and downright painful to watch . \nMaybe other interviews do it , I however they do it , I have never noticed it . \nPiers needs to take a Valium and mellow out ! \nHe could be cutting off his guests due to nerves . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 11:04 pm | Report abuse | I quite agree that he interupts and cuts people off mid sentence -- very annoying - it is almost as if he is not interested in the answer . \nOprah does it as well . \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 2:03 am | Report abuse | Your editing and cutting off of guests is appalling . \nHire some new people for your staff . \nAlso keep in mind your role here on CNN Mr. Morgan ... ... this is n't tabloid news ! \nFebruary 2 , 2011 at 7:35 pm | Report abuse | SHUT THEIR MOUTH AND MIND THEIR OWN BUSINESS !! Dang !! ... given that we have our own organizations setup to specificly start these problems for other countries ... Some people , I swear ! \nI think British must stay away from all the problems in this world . \nTheir greed and colonial time created all these pains and agony for 2\\/3 of the world population . \nThat pretty much goes for the US as well does it not ? \n@Dave , could you sound slightly more like a retarded 12-year-old ? \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 8:12 pm | Report abuse | Can you say English please because the Scottish , -LRB- Me -RRB- Welsh and Irish were also colonised to an extent ! \nlol Blair , you and your country are to be blame to everything bad that happens in the middle east . \nBlair , you lost a golden oportunity ti keep your mouth closed ! \nI do not think Tony Blair speak too much , he made international mess in UK , if will better for him to go and live peacefully in India or Thailand where God exists Shaji , I think you 're wrong ! \nThe brits can not stay away from all the problems of this world just because , if they 're not the problem itself , they in one way or another helped to create it ! \nIt 's utterly PATHETIC for Tony Blair to comment on what 's happening in Egypt or the region for that matter . \nHe , as most `` experts '' in the Middle East , did not see the revolution of Freedom and Dignity coming in Tunisia and still does n't grasp its meaning . \nThat revolution , being replicated in Egypt , is about the people taking matters in their own hands to let their regime and its foreign cronies know that they 've had enough and that they can manage their affairs on their own . \nGet used to it , Tony Blair , and find another line of work if you have any decency left . \nBlair should keep his mouth shut , he 's a total gaff . \nEspecially when it comes to the Mideast , he 's simply a puppet . \nIt seems that the only reason that the Westt is not completely siding with the people and fearing the fall of Mubarak is worry about Israel 's security . \nHow long are we going to step on our values , principles , and way of life to please Israel that is not ever satisfied and often snubs its finger on our face ? \nIf Israel was out of the equation , then I have no doubt that the West would be supporting the people , their freedom and democracy 100 % . \nThe simple fact is that any democracy , whether bring Islamists to power or not , will not take Israeli abuses and atrocities lightly , while a paid coward dictator shields Israel . \nThat 's why the West is really worried . \nTime to be on the right side of history , dump colonist fanatic unwavering Israel , live up to our principles of support to freedom , democracy , and human rights . \nThen , we would be cherished and our TRUE interests would be protected . \nWho the hell care what Tony Blair has to say . \nHe has ruined his reputation so badly by being George Bush 's lap-dog . \nHe should disappear with whatever dignity he has left and never been seen or heard again . \nJust like Colin Powell , and Condi Rice . \nAs much as I find the irritating British accent annoying , I can deal with Tony Blair . \nI just ca n't stand YOU Pi-ss O-ff Morgan . \nGet off the air . \nI hate your annoying British accent . \nIf an anchor had a Chinese accent , they would never be allowed on the air unless they were reporting on China . \nThis is America and I really wish you 'd get off our air waves and go broadcast for your own people in the UK who do n't find your accent as annoying . \nGo away , please . \nwow , what a simple minded person you must be to be concerned about accents , if only the whole world was america and everyone spoke the same , would that make your life easier ? \nWell , not really . \nBy your comment , I 'm assuming that you are saying you are not `` simple minded '' ! \nOK , Let 's see how you are NOT `` simple minded '' . \nconsider this : If he had an Indian or Chinese or African accent , he would never even have a chance to be on the air here in America . \nA British accent is still a foreign accent and just as -LRB- if not more -RRB- annoying . \nGet him off the air . \nI 'm sick of his irritating voice ! \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 8:51 pm | Report abuse | Actually , I find it refreshing to hear someone , with clear diction and excellent grammar , regardless of accent . \nI will avoid watching the Tony B-Liar interview , however ! \nSurely you could find something more important on which to focus your attention . \nSimply change the station and in the process , take your absurd comments elsewhere . \nRight ... we should all listen to him . . \nHe and Bush got us into a disastrous war under false pretences . \nHe needs to go away and let Sovereign nations solve their own problems . \nHosni Mubarak , who engineered 9\\/11 to sell hatred of Islam for 10 years ? \nyes of course all the evil in the world is the fault of the usa and the uk ... all ignorant infidels ... muslims are the pure saints of the world oh and the muslim brotherhood are the greatest saints of all , they will take over egypt and install a true democracy with the brutal subjugation of women , stoning of adulterers and slaughter of all jews ... then the world will live in peace Tony Blair needs to hang his head in shame and disappear from the public stage . \nBetter yet he should be in prison with Bush and Cheney and a number of others , but since no government has the integrity to pursue justice with these criminals , Blair should at least have the decency to shut up . \nthat refers to you now , How professional -- why do n't you just roll your eyes the whole time Tony Blair speaks , Piers ? \nI first turned on your show expecting an arrogant , unconnecte person . \nI must say , I owe you an appology . \nYou are a gifted interviewer . \nYour show is very unique and you press key leaders on recondite issues in a way that is absolutely spell bounding . \nTo top it off you dice up your show with interviews of entertainers that show them in a light I have never seen . \nYou have won me over as a viewer - but then again I am just a Bubba from Georgia ... . \nBest of luck - Phil Hey Piers i like u show ... ... i need to get to know u better can u tell Mr. Blair for me that after Iraq '' ` WHO THE HELL CARES ABOUT HIS OPINION '' '' Tony Blair sounds like a nervous coward right now on your show . \nGood Lord with people like Mr Blair no wonder Mubarak lasted so long in power Tony Blaire meant to say '' I am shameless clown with zero self respect and dignity . \nI would love to kill millions more if i get a chance '' No courage from Blair or Romny . \nthey are both shame free . \nThey stand for democracy only when it is conveniet to them Tony Blair sound very uncomfortable ... is it because he knows he 's guilty of dirty politics in the Middle East ? \nFirst piece of intelligent reporting I 've seen on the Middle East situation for days . \nTony Blair brought a depth of analysis based on first-hand experience of the personalities shaping the region which has been absent from much of the one-sided gung-ho knee-jerk reportage . \nPiers asked some unpleasant questions and squeezed out a response from a seasoned political interviewee . \nA deftly handled interview . \negypt today explains why there has never been success in the Israel Palistinian peace talks . \nNo Arab government ever wanted to see a democratic Palistinian state because if it happened just such events as are happening now would threaten all the Arab Dictators and Kings . \nTherefore whenever `` peace '' was close it was undermined by those who had everything to lose . \nIs was not Israel , but the Arabs who had the most to lose . \nIf I am not correct why did not Saudi Arabia or one of the other rich oil countries not give a few billions to the Palistinians ? \nWhy do we always have to stick our noses where it does n't belong ! \nBecause even though you say we do n't belong ; we most probably might get more than our noses punched . \nAnd that 's the reason for that not to be sneezed at . \nThe protesters in Alexandra , Egypt , were n't checked for weapons at the protest ; where as those in `` Freedom Square '' Cairo were all checked going in for same . \nThe comments have got very puerile since Larry King retired ... & it 's not down to Piers Morgan . \nAlso , Tony Blair has as much a right to be on this program as any one else . \nThree times as Prime Minister of Great Britain & one of those times was after he went to war in Iraq with the Coalition of sorts was no small feat . \nThose remonstrating would have to be a leader of a country to ralise that you have to make decisions on the advice of a lot of experts that would give their opinions on different issues , re ; war , etc. . \nEven the Attorney General at the time backed him onhis decision along with a majority in the House of Commons . \nSo to judge in hindsight is very easy ; but to have to make a decision that might even mean your own country 's soldier 's might n't come home alive , that is much more intractable . \nEven for a great Prime Minister . \nFuture political historians will be much kinder to him , especially when they 're judging his whole life & especially for his role in the Irish Peace Agreement . \nDo you have any substance to back it up ? \nAh Tony Blair , what do you really expect from a war criminal ? \nStill to this day he defends the Iraq War , maybe he should visit Iraq and just walk around the neighborhoods , I am sure people will thank him for their `` liberation . '' \nPiers ... you seem like you have a nice personality ... I wonder if you took out for dinner Susan Boyle as you said you would ... ? \nTony Blair sorry to say , was hood winked by George Bush and followed him into disaster into Iraq . \nThat 's why I believe he is not the guy who has any wise comments about Egypt . \nUSA and GB should be ashamed of their dirty politics , for they personal profit they oppressed whole countries in the Middle East . \nMay be the esteemed Tony Blair should comment on why the Brits allowed Hosni 's son Gamal to quietly sneak into their country with 200 suitcases when things got hot in Egypt . . \nProtecting the crooks because they were loyal ... ? \nTerrible Blair interview ... If you are going to invite one of the most influential leaders of our time to come on your show -LRB- boost your self-admittedly suffering ratings -RRB- and give his opinions on a situation that he has and will continue to have an influence on , then you should allow him to speak and not edit his responses . \nYou did this presumably to woo the republicans in this nation , that do n't `` typically '' tune in to CNN , to listen to Romney . \n-LRB- I 'm more republican than not , but come on ... he 's tried twice -RRB- Not very many people in this nation are interested in you watering down Blair 's interview -LRB- someone who has perspective and impact on the situation -RRB- , to hear a former governor of Massachusetts and twice failed presidential candidate give his opinion . \nLarry King was as good as he was because he was n't chasing ratings by flying by the wind ... he was more thoughtful . \nWhat a terrible interviews and job you do Piers . \nVery poor and lack of clever questions . \nYou are asking things that most people already know and when you ask a question that may be worth analyzing you just move on onto another silly question . \nWell , I am glad that CNN has other programs that we can enjoy professional journalism . \nSorry Piers but I am not quite happy with your performance as an interviewer so far So , JPTX are you a Journalist or Reporter for the Wall Street Journal or maybe the New York Times ?? I did n't think so . \nSo , then what makes you qualified to evaluate Piers Morgan 's qualifications as an Interviewer ? \nI 'm sure Piers has more awards and accolades for Journalism or anything else than you will ever see in a lifetime . \nRemember , when you point a finger at someone else you point two at yourself ! \nInstead of criticizing Piers Morgan , do n't watch the show ay ? \nTune into Rush Limbaugh , he 's probably more your style -LRB- down and dirty -RRB- . \nPiers , tonight I enjoyed your interview with Tony Blair . \nI happen to believe Mr. Blair is a man to respect and look up to . \nMy mother is from England and I have been to England twice with my mother in the past and all my mothers relatives are there . \nAs I have come to know and respect the English people , I have come to the following conclusions : Our country -LRB- the U.S. -RRB- is in BIG trouble for many reasons and it is my belief our leaders , politicians , or whatever they want to call themselves need help from England 's leaders in the way of leadership , honesty , and discipline . \nAfter all , the English are our founding fathers and the english people have been on this earth much longer than any American . \nI 'm talking through history . \nI do know England is our greatest ally and the US needs England . \nThe English are very strong in nature and determined to persevere . \nAmericans somehow have become hostile , uncaring , greedy , and dishonest . \nI 'm not saying 100 % of Americans are this way but there are far more that are this way than are not . \nBarack Obama is the best thing that has happened to the U.S. in a very , very long time and yet he has n't even been in office two years and a large majority of Americans just want to tear him down . \nActually that began the day he was sworn in . \nNow whoever does n't see anything wrong with that is really sick . \nI believe evil forces such as the Terrorists in this world have infiltrated the U.S. with the intention of stirring up trouble to the point of our own destruction by causing terrible divisions among American people . \nWell I believe their strategy is working . \nWe are destroying ourselves from within . \nBTW you are a very good interviewer and try not to pay attention to the messages you get about being a terrible interviewer and person . \nYou are working in the U.S. now on national TV and in America insults are now a part of our culture . \nYou should be proud to be an Englishman . \nGood luck to you sir and keep up the good work . \nTony Bliar is the unprincipled weasel of truth . \nHaving him as a `` peace keeper '' is like having a fox manage a chicken coop ! \nAny Middle East leader that are friends of Toni Bliar are sitting on shifting sand . \nThe Bush 's lap dog obediently changed laps . \nTony Bliar lied to his own people and sent them to Iraq to be killed and kill millions of innocent people . \nWhat makes him different to Saddam Husein ? \nWelllll , Nana Brown I assume you are an American??!@? Who knows these days . \nIn your comment is n't that kind of like the kettle calling the teapot black ? \nDid n't Bush start it all by telling Americans that Sadaam had WMD in his stash and then after over 4,000 Americans died in Iraq , Whoops , no WMD ! \nThe first mistake Tony Blair made was to believe ANY American politician , President or not ! \nLet 's get our facts straight shall we all before we start throwing up all over the Internet . \nBecause of work requirements tonight was the first chance I had to see Piers on this show . \nWhen it was announced he was taking over from Larry King I thought that all the American audience knew about Piers was his stint as a judge on America 's Got Talent , and that like some actors he may be too stereotyped to be accepted in this type show . \nCan anyone imagine Larry King conducting tonights interview with Tony Blair as well . \nExcellent questions and he knew something about the subject matter , and did n't simply accept responses but challeged them . \nThere was this big hype about this program before it began . \nI have been watching every single interview and so far I must say I am not impressed at all . \nWhy do you have to cut them off when they are in the middle of a sentence ? \nThis is no art of an interview . \nWe need to hear what they want to say fully . \nYou may try being quiet after you 've asked the question . \nafter all it is not a battle . \nAnd why do you keep repeating the programs this early in the season ? \nTony Blair has done nothing of substance in the Middle East other than talk a good game . \nNow I am convinced more than ever why people are relying more and more on alternative media like intenet outlets They feell they get more realobjective , refreshing and truthful\\/unbiased information from them than any of the main stream media and that also includes CNN I mean interviewing somebody like Tony Blair or Romney for that matter about democratization is like asking a predator about the peace and security of any of the herbivores groups . \nMr. Blair although he likes to put in his two-cents worth has absolutely nothing to do with people 's revolution for democracy in Egypt . \nIf anything , he was more than happy to . \nover the years , shake the hands of Mubarak at every turn for being such a pliant servant to the wishes of pro-zionist agendas . \nTony Blair still believes he is significant when in fact he is a fraud and an old news !! Mr. Morgan , what did Tony Blair promise you so that you put him on your show . \nIf Piers Morgan is going to have guests who speak in cliches , like the Kardashien sisters , you may as well go back to Larry King , then they can all speak in cliches together . \nPiers Morgan shame on you to say on Mubarak that he is Tyrant . \nMubarak has done for Egypt and the Middle East more and more things to keep peace . \nWhat Obama or Tony Blair has done , Nothing . \nIt is the first time I lose confidence in CNN . \nIt looks like I m watching EL Jazeera or something . \nI m really disappointed I stopped watching CNN when I wanted to find news about Egypt I found this Morgan british guy . \nWhy is this british guy on our national news program ? \nI did not like his tone or manners toward the Obama and the White House . \nI found the MSNBC -LRB- they were presenting a report about Goldman Sacs hand in all these uprisings -RRB- channel as a result and will no longer watch CNN . \nIs it my computer or is Tony Blair wearing a satin suit ? \nLast night was the first time I watched the new Piers Morgan Show , having never been a particular fan of Mr. Morgan , however I was pleasantly surprised with the straight forward , on point questioning of former Prime Minister Tony Blair and Mr , Blair 's opinion of the peoples revolutions taking place in Egypt and all across northern Africa and the Middle East . \nMorgan 's interview of Blair was respectful while at the same time asking the tough questions and not being afraid to push Mr. Blair to actually give an answer . \nI have a completely new respect for Mr. Morgan 's interviewing talents and look forward to watching his show on a regular basis . \nMr. Morgan brings a completely fresh , comon sense voice to a sea of `` talking heads '' that otherwise waste air time on TV . \nWell what happens up here in Egypt is affecting everybody especially me ... I 'm Egyptian teenager who have been struggling from Mubarak 's presidency . . \nHe is so old and so mischievous , We hated him long long time ago , He has been a vampire who sucks the people 's blood , It hurts to see your parents struggle all their life to provide us the fundamental basics of humanity that most Of Countries provide to their citizens . . \nwe had enough as we had nothing of our Human Rights , Mubarak calls for Democracy then what Democracy means on his world ??! we 've been out of internet and Networks for 6 days because he 's coward fearing his citizens ' speech . . \nwe have the right to speech and say what are we seeking for ... we 're seeking for freedom , for prosperity and Luxury . \nwe did n't want him ever he stays by election fraud . . \nwe want him to leave , and give up all he hopes to achieve for Egypt cause we 're sure that nothing would change , He promised a lot , He lied a lot , that we gained through these 30 years of his presidency , is n't the time to go ?? , He did let the police to kill over 300 innocent protesters who are calling for freedom . . \nis that what suppose to happen when you raise your voice ?! . \nHe 's nonsense person , He 's deceiving cunning president . . \nwe 're sick of him , we had enough , we want him out of this Country , legally he 's no of president to this country . . \nthe people got him down . . \nwe 'll find away to every unjust who does not respect humanity . . \nhis speech is all nag nag nag !! Enough is enough ... we Have no future as long as he 's staying !!! I just listened to Anderson Cooper complaining about being harassed in a crowd in Egypt and I could n't help but wonder what on earth else he expected . \nFor days he has been reporting only the side of the protestors , never did find out if they were being supported by outside forces from countries who want to see Egypt collapse and he never tried to find out how the millions of other Egyptians felt . \nIt appears that the groups now opposing the protestors are not so much `` for Mubarak '' as they are `` for stability '' . \nThey want their country back , want to be able to go to work , get food , get money at banks and not have to protect their own property . \nThey have just as much right to be there as the protestors . \nNow that Mubarak has said he will go and will move up the elections , it appears the protestors are not using reason . \nThey seem to have a mob mentality now and are not realizing that there has to be some sort of government in place . \nThat fellow who claims to be an opposition leader who could have been a huge help refused to meet with Mubarak so what is his agenda ? \nThe media fuelled the mob frenzy and now that there could be a peaceful stand-off and the government could work towards a democratic precess , the media and mob do n't seem to want that . \nThe journalists can not complain if they are harassed because if you jump into a fire you may get burned . \nToni Blair is the Middle East envoy for Peace is a blood thirst war monger serving Israel . \nThe world finally has woken up and all those Middle East self serving corrupt leaders that could be bought for a price with our tax dollars will have to flee to England , Saudi Arabia or Israel . \nGoogle Tony Blair it all comes back to him : I 'm benefiting from all of your interviews . \nThanks re Tony Blair . \nHe was so insightful as UK PM . \nI am engrossed in his book '' A Journey '' . \nP. 454 -- in his speech to both Houses of Congress -LRB- July , 2003 -RRB- : '' ... anytime ordinary people are given the chance to choose , the choice is the same : freedom , not tyranny ; democracy , not dictatorship ; the rule of law , not the rule of the secret police '' . \nAnd , p. 682 : '' ... the power of people is needed to liberate the politics . '' \nPiers needs to lighten up . \nHe 's trying way to hard to win ratings with what he thinks is a revolutionary style . \nIt sadly comes off as just petulant rantings . \nI do n't give him long if he continues this way . \nI like your programm Mr Morgan . \nThe interview with Tony Blair made me so sick to my stomch . \nThis guy still thinks that they really needed to create that miss in Iraq . \nHe never answered the questions about Mubarak and all the oppresion and torture he 's done to his own people . \nHis only point was to tell us that he is a pro israel . \nSo all the arabs and democracy and the right of people to live go to hell as long as Israel is safe and happy . \nTony blair does not speak for people in the UK about anything he sold us a load of rubbish with iraq . \nThe guy is a war monger who made a fortune for himself when he was prime minister . \nThe guy is a disgrace ! \n-LRB- required , but will not be displayed -RRB- CNN welcomes a lively and courteous discussion as long as you follow the Rules of Conduct set forth in our Terms of Service . \nComments are not pre-screened before they post . \nYou agree that anything you post may be used , along with your name and profile picture , in accordance with our Privacy Policy and the license you have granted pursuant to our Terms of Service . \nNotify me of follow-up comments via email . \n`` If you are fat , it is the number one preventable cause of death '' @Faith_Saile ... calls Chris #Christie `` irresponsible '' for being overweight 9:08 pm ET February 11 , 2013 RETWEET `` Donny , I 'm going to be killing it at 89 .

{"id": "232", "time": "2011-02-01", "text": "As Egyptian protesters demanding reform fill the streets by the hundreds of thousands , it 's worth remembering that the U.S. helps control the purse strings in that country . \nAmerican taxpayers give $ 1.5 billion dollars a year in foreign aid to Egypt , second only to Israel . \nAlthough the White House has said it 's reviewing this aid depending on the military 's behavior - One top Republican says now is not the time to threaten to withhold any of this money . \nCongresswoman Kay Granger - who chairs the house subcommittee in charge of foreign aid - says we should n't use the money as a stick to force Mubarak into reforms . \nGranger says most of the $ 1.5 billion goes toward the military - which seems to be a stabilizing force among the demonstrators . \nGranger says Congress should only consider withholding aid if there 's evidence that U.S. military equipment is being used improperly . \nSeveral top Democrats are on the same page , saying the U.S. should remain committed to assisting Egypt . \nThey point to the close relationship between the two countries . \nNonetheless , some experts think cutting financial aid is the best way to get results . \nA bipartisan group of former officials says the administration should suspend all aid to Egypt until the government : Agrees to elections as soon as possible , allows banned candidates to run , immediately lifts the state of emergency that 's been in place for decades , releases political prisoners , and allows for freedom of the media and assembly . \nHere s my question to you : Should the U.S. withhold any of its $ 1.5 billion in financial aid to Egypt ? \nInterested to know which ones made it on air ? \nDeaddin in Cupertino , California writes : Jack , As an American -LRB- from Egyptian descent -RRB- , I think that the U.S. should withhold all aid until elections are called - elections that are inclusive of all parties and all candidates interested in running . \nBy withholding aid , you will see the fastest results . \nMichael in New Mexico writes : No. . \nWe have to honor our treaties and other agreements with Egypt . \nWe need to use their airspace and the Suez Canal to have access to trade and tourism . \nWhat is the cost of peaceful relations ? \n$ 1.5 billion in financial aid is a bargain for what we get . \nAnd , considering that Egypt uses that money to buy military equipment from us , it really is n't aid at all . \nLiving in Egypt for four years as an American and being a part of an Egyptian family and culture , I know Egyptians view any support given to Egypt and its people as a positive reflection upon the U.S. To take away aid would be regarded as a lack of direct support to the people and Egypt . \nTo use aid as a punishment would only hurt the people and our image in the Egypt that they regard so highly . \nAs sports , hamburger and fries are a given in our country , ` bartering ' is as strong in most if not all Middle East countries . \nThe art of the deal is manifest in all negotiations , especially in Mideast politics . \nPuting pressure on the military 's income stream will transfer up the ` political ' chain from the Egyptian military leadership to Mubarak . \nIt will ultimately define who really has the power in Egypt . \nTheir military is more likely to make a better ` deal ' with Mubarak then any U.S. attempt to reason a new paradigm . \nWe need to learn how to play their brand of hard-ball in which friendship takes a side seat when ` push ' needs to become ` shove ' . \nIf funds should be withheld from Egypt until a democracy is formed , funds should be withheld from Israel until a two-state solution is found and there is peace with the Palestinians . \nThe double-standard should not apply , yet again . \nStop foreign aid altogether . \nPlease show me the logic in paying out huge sums to anyone when the U.S. is broke and has to borrow the money . \nAgain , American imperialism caught red handed ! \nAnother case where we 're caught supporting a dictator that is in bed with us instead of supporting human rights which we always hear from our Wa DC leaders . \nWhat hypocracy from the American government . \nWe should be protesting at the capital too for a politically corrupt government that we have . \nBTW , no where in the US Constitution does it allow foreign aide to anyone . \nWe 're broke but we keep supporting these American puppet governments throughout the world . \nAmericans need to wake up and demand real change or else ! \nWe should only withhold aid if the riots continue getting out of control and Mubarak still refuses to cede power . \nPresident Obama should urge Mubarak to let his people know that he will not seek another corrupt reelection as he had done previously . \n30 years in power is a lot more than enough . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 4:04 pm | tampa , fl china called , they want the money back any way . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 4:09 pm | No. . \nWe have to honor our treaties and other agreements with Egypt . \nWe need to use their airspace , the Suez Canal , to have access to trade , and tourism . \nWhat is the cost of peaceful relations ? \n1.5 billion in financial aid is a bargain for what we get . \nAnd , considering that Egypt uses that money to buy military equipment from us , it really is n't aid at all . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 4:11 pm | Why do n't we wait and see what happens first ? \nSeeing that we want Egypt to remain stable and responsible , why do something precipitous . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 4:15 pm | Tom Mytoocents Fort Lauderdale , Florida We should withold aid until the smoke clears . \nWhen we see who the government represents then funds could be released slowly and monitor how funds are spent . \nWe should do the same stateside with our own budget as well . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 4:22 pm | Yes the u.s. should stop giving billions to egypt and israel . \nWe are borrowing money at 4.5 % interest from the banksters and giving it to two countries who have budget surpluses . \nIt is insane to continue giving money to countries who do n't need financial help from the u.s. who has a total national debt of 235 trillion dollars , 4 times the world GDP . \nInstead of congress and obama living in fantasy world they should immediatley declare a fiscal emergency and cut 500 billion from the annual federal budget which has a 1.5 trillion dollar deficit . \nThe people living in countries with dictators seem to have more power than the people in this country . \nThe banks and corporattions are draining this country dry , outsourcing jobs , gambling with 0 % loaned taxpayer money , and investing in every country except america . \nShame on obama and congress . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 4:23 pm | We should keep things business as usual until such time as a new arrangement is put into place . \nTo do anything else would be influencing the outcome of this situation . \nBesides , if that bipartisan group really wanted Mubarak to change , why did n't they push for reforms before ? \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 4:29 pm | I think that the U.S. should withhold its $ 1.5 billion aid to Egypt until the following conditions are satisfactorily met : \\* Hosni Mubarak officially resigns as Egyptian president . \n\\* A chosen replacement to Mr. Mubarak supports U.S. policies and the peace agreement between Israel and Egypt . \n\\* The chosen replacement must also initiate and support democratic and economic reforms . \n\\* Opposition persons and parties are allowed to participate in free elections . \n\\* The elected person as Egypt 's next president supports U.S. policies , democratic\\/economic reforms and recognizes Israel . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 4:30 pm | I would give them the aid to pay for free internet access for every location in the country -LRB- monitored by USA and Free Europe -RRB- but only to one site so that the people of Egypt can nominate some new leaders , and then vote on who it is that they really want in power . \nThis would do away with all the foreign speculations which are doing nothing to help the situation there ! \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 4:39 pm | Now is not the time to add fuel to the fire . \neverything should continue as normal until the political issues and their resolution are better identified . \nKnee jerks should be saved for the dance floor . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 4:42 pm | The aid is not helping Egyptian women , youth and seniors to live a life of dignity . \nThe aid seems to benefit Mubarak and his cronies , including the military and the murderous secret police . \nThe aid needs to be redirected so it can go through non-governmental organizations run by women and geared to helping women . \nAfter all , when you help women , their entire families benefit . \nNot the case when you direct help to men . \nHelp Egypt , not Mubarak ; the two are not synonumous . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 4:54 pm | No , we should keep sending aid as long as china will lend us the money or the printing presses do n't break down . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 4:56 pm | Absolutely America should hold aid until we see who gets into power after the dust settles . \nBesides that , why should America send a billion and a half dollars in aid that we will have to borrow from China . \nWe are broke folks . \nAny money we give away we have to borrow from someone else driving up our own deficit . \nThey are an oil rich country how about trading oil for money . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 4:57 pm | We 'll just be giving the new radical Muslim Egyptian `` government '' that is going to emerge -LRB- one that will despise the US -RRB- $ 1.5 B so I think we should hold it and pay off a tenth of the national debt . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 4:57 pm | When you see people moving in a civilized way toward greater democracy , the best thing to do is get out of the way . \nFurther , aid to Egypt is not intended for Mubarak but to support the role of Egypt in Middle East politics . \nThis role might not change much . \nWhether we should decrease foreign aid in general will be budget issue but we should not single out Egypt at this time . \nTo sum , we should not mess until we have a clear way to contribute to progress . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 4:58 pm | What 's happening in Egypt is worth watching , and I hope a true democracy can be established . \nBut the U.S. is broke - all foreign aid should be stopped . \nIt 's time to look after our own country . \nIf we cut funding to Egypt , what happens to our ability to use Egypt 's airspace ? \nWhat happens to the people who are already in dire financial straits , if our funding goes away , and the country sinks into total chaos & worse yet , total violence ? \nIf the Suez Canal is blocked , and we ca n't use their airspace , I think we will regret it . \nSome politicians seem to have fast easy quips as to what we should do , but most of those off-the-cuff comments are not well thought-out . \nI think we should continue to talk behind the scenes with Mubarac , watch the developments , and continue our support until we have a lot more solid data to substantiate making changes in our funding . \nLet 's wait and hear what Sarah and Michelle have to say ... perhaps they can enlighten the rest of us as to how best we can proceed . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:08 pm | Yes . \nAnd withhold the thirty billion in cash , weapons , and technology we give to israel . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:09 pm | Why is the US still providing any financial aid to any country ? \nWhy not stop it all , and start paying down the debt . \nLet Egypt and Israel worry about themselves . \nYour Empire is ending , America ... February 1 , 2011 at 5:12 pm | Yes . \nNot even a single dime should be given to tyrants . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:16 pm | We should not use the money as a stick to force Mubarak into reforms , says congresswoman Granger , but the same money has been used for 30 yrs by Mubarak to stiffle the growth of democracy and freedom in Egypt , Is this a good news to be proud of ? . \nWhy do we use our money to promote force strength in Egypt , rather than democratic values . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:16 pm | February 1 , 2011 at 5:16 pm | Of course we will continue to give them aid ! \nRight now we will give aid to anybody who will take it !!!! The more of our american dollars we have floating around the world ... the more they are needed !!!! And thank goodness we are the only ones who can print them ... and print them we do !!!!!! February 1 , 2011 at 5:17 pm | Yes , withhold the money -- we need it here . \nHave n't you noticed that we have many dire situations here where that money would be better spent ? \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:17 pm | There is no reason for the american taxpayer to be supporting ANYONE overseas . \nCharity begins at home . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:17 pm | Who thinks witholding aid would yield quick results ? \nDid Iran 's behavior change when the international community accelerated sanctions ? \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:17 pm | Should the U.S. withhold any of its $ 1.5 billion in financial aid to Egypt ? \nno , instead of writting a blank check or sending them more weapons , we should send them food , water and hygiene supplies February 1 , 2011 at 5:17 pm | I think that The usa should leave the egyptian people to make theire decision ... becaus the fact of giving the 1.3 million dollar as a finaincial aid it 's like byuing the coutry not helping ... February 1 , 2011 at 5:17 pm | Absolutely not . \nThe US is making a grave mistake in not supporting Mubarek . \nIt is clear that what started as protests for reforms has turned into an extremist movement . \nEl Barradei is a dangerous man , sympathetic to extremists and smart enough to downplay it to the west . \nThe demands of this mob are unreasonable to say the least and the Muslim Brotherhood is pushing for extreme change not toward democracy , but toward their own agenda ... that is why they refuse to meet with the VP , refuse reforms , refuse even the transition time needed . \nThey want sympathizers in charge now . \nAnd the country and region will crumble . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:18 pm | I am not so eager to embrace this new `` democratic '' movement . \nIn a democracy , without contstitutional protections of minorities , separation of church and state , without equal rights of all minorities and system of laws to protect everyone , it is destined to devolve into another oppressive Islamist regime , ala Iran . \nTo borrow a phrase , it will be akin to a democratic vote taken between 3 wolves and a lamb about what 's for dinner . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:18 pm | We should stop all aid period . \nWe have no business in Egypt 's internal affairs . \nThe US needs to learn that we should not pay for friendship , but in turn earn it ! \nThis practice usually backfires more than it works !! February 1 , 2011 at 5:18 pm | American have kept quiet so far , that was good . \nNow you are talking about money -- not now please ! \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:18 pm | Although the money is supposed to go to the military , has n't Mubarak been diverting some of it to the police ? \nWe should cut that and put it into direct aid to the Egyptian people , like food ! \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:18 pm | Jack -- as an American -LRB- from Egyptian descent -RRB- I think that the US should withold all aid until elections are called , and elections that are inclusive of all parties and all candidates interested in running . \nBy withholding aid , you will see the fastest results . \nIt 's very simplistic , but it 's very similar to witholding an allowance for a child for misbehaving , they will listen right away if that were to take place . \nI pray that all this ends soon and Egypt moves on to good things . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:18 pm | Pending resolution of the transition of power and reconstruction of a constitutional government , the military is the only constant holding things together in Egypt at the moment . \nI believe doing that at this time would be suicidal to our relationship with Egypt . \nYes , Mubarek needs to speed up the transitional process - hopefully to a temporary leadership pending RAPID turnaround elections . \nHe made reference to `` speedy '' elections ... it can not wait 8 months . \nOther countries in the middle east are seeing this and already acting . \nThe status quo is not an acceptable option . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:18 pm | No , the U.S. should not withhold 1.5 B in aid to Egypt because only the people will suffer , NOT MUBARAK nor his inner circle . \nHe 'll benefit from the suffering it would cause . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:18 pm | What ... ... ????? Has George Bush paid a visit to the situation room at the White House ?? Come on , Jack ... . \nwe 're talking about the OBAMA administration here ... ... we 're not going to withold any money , nor are we going to start a war ... ... . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:18 pm | I agree , it 's time for us to stop sending out anything to other countries until we get our own financial situation under control . \nThat would save a LOT of $ $ $ $ . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:19 pm | No ! \nNow is n't the time to shut down foreign aid to Egypt . \nThe people of that country are making change with the HELP of the Egyptian Army . \nSince most of the aid goes to the Army , cutting that off would seem to hinder , not help , the people achieve the reforms they are looking for . \nLawmakers calling for aid to stop should turn on their TV and watch what 's happening -LRB- withouth their help -RRB- . \nSometimes it pays to just stay out of the situation . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:19 pm | is this a question ? \ni thought the U , S. was in debt ! \nlet 's rethink all of our handouts . \nyes - without the whole $ 1.5 bil . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:19 pm | yes , i believe our country should withhold all aid until justice is done for the peaceful protesters -- Jobs , economic stability , etc. . \nTime after time we back repressive regimes with most of our aid going to the military . \nWhat a recipe for disaster ! \nLet 's do this right , for a change . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:19 pm | Absolutely not -- if the US withholds aid to Egypt , the people will seek aid elsewhere . \nDesperate people seeking help from the wrong groups , such as Hamas and Hisballah is dangerous for the US and for the stability of the Middle East . \nEgypt has been an ally and it should continue to receive support until it gives us a reason to distrust . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:19 pm | I do not think many of us understood that we were supporting a brutal dictator just to protect Israel . \nWhat does that say about the USA ? \nWe protect one peoples to the detirment of another ? \nI say do n't send them another cent until there free elections . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:19 pm | Jack . \nThey should not withhold any of the 1.5 B in aid . \nThat comes out to about $ 20\\/person in Egypt . \nThat is a good deal for freedom for all of us . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:19 pm | Hypocrisy , double stardards and lack transparency is the biggest contributor of what is happening in the Arab world at the moment and USA is part and parcel of it . \nWhat is democracy in essence Jack ? \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | The US should with hold a portion of our aide to Egypt until they have fair elections . \nI do not trust Mubrak or what he said today . \nThose people deserve freedom . \nThanks February 1 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | Yes we should withhold the aid until the situation is resolved . \nI totally expect Egypt to close the Suez Canal as a result of it but tough choices need tp be made . \nWe may get $ 10 gasoline and long lines but I am all for it . \nBesides ... the oil stocks will go through the roof . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | Absolutley Not ! \nThis Would Be Wrong And A Way Of Stabbing Egypt In The Back , These People Are Just Fighting For Their Freedoms And Its Not Right To Stop Aid To Egypt Just To Force Someone Out Of Office , Its Not Our Place On Weather President Mubarrak Stays In Power Or Leaves Unless He 's A Threat To Our Country ! \nIF funds should be withheld from Egypt until a democracy is formed , funds should be withheld from Israel until a two-state solution is found and there is peace with the Palestinians . \nThe double-standard should not apply , yet again . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | Are you crazy ? \nThere should be no punishment for a country creating a new and improved version of itself . \nEgypt is a friend that will face many obstacles in the coming years . \nTo deny aid is to not only say we do n't care about Egypt 's people at all , do n't care that they 've ousted a human rights abuser , and but to actually say we prefer them to be subjugated and miserable . \nPersonally , I 'm appalled anyone is suggesting denying aid . \nNow , if we want to delay it until the new government is in place , that is one thing . \nBut denying it all together ? \nI 'm glad this article implies that most of Congress has their heads screwed on straight in regards to this . \nI hope it is true . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | Egypt is not a poor country . \nOnce they rule themselves and get rid of the corrupt mafia they will send the US assistance to help it in its financial crisis ! \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | Yes any aid which is being given to Egypt -- the Egyptian Government must be terminated until Mubarak the despicable dictator leaves along with his cronies There must be a clean break with this corrupt oppressive regime Listen to the people they are fed up with this regime . \nAll other regimes in the Middle East should take note they will soon be swept away The genie has escaped from the bottle February 1 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | No. . \nU.S should not get directly involved in any way except in verbal support of democracy . \nMbarak has conceeded to the changes demanded and has agreed to step down in a peaceful transition . \nThat should be enough for any mature opposition ! \nAll U.S should do is assure the Egytian people that iWe will hold Mbarak to that commitment . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | NO ! \nIn fact if the USA is still the home of government of , by and for the people , they should at least double it ! \nIf you could afford $ 1.5 billion for all those years in support of a un-democratic lie , surely $ 3 billion is a small price to pay for some democratic truth -- no matter how bitter it may taste , good medicine always helps when it is applied in a timely manner and the Egyptian people need a good dose of medicine right now . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:21 pm | In my opinion , not at this time . \nWe need to wait and see how this plays out . \nLet the people of Egypt bring about their own reforms . \nThey seem to know what they want , power to the people . \nThey are in favor of the army that the USA helps support , withdrawing money now might be perceived as an affront to the Egyptian people , as well as an interference . \nThis should only be a last resort . \nIf the people themselves force Mubarak out of power it will mean more to them than the USA doing it . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:21 pm | stop flow of money to Mubarak IMMEDIATELY : he is another dictator but one we like ... and then there are democratically governemnts -LRB- like HAMAS -RRB- we dont like ; we are a real bunch of HYPOCRITES ! \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:21 pm | The money we send to Egypt goes to a dictator and not the people . \nThe U.S should cease sending American money Immediately . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:21 pm | No Jack , we should n't use the aid to Egypt as a weapon against them to achieve our goals . \nIf anything , we should suspend the aid to Israel who 's heavy handed bullying tactics have caused nothing but problems in this world . \nIsrael does n't need our money . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:21 pm | K Shabman - Atlantic Beach , Fl I suppose it depends on how much spending money the U. S. wants to give Mubarak access to when he stops stalling and leaves the country . \nIs anyone watching the banking system in Egypt while Mubarak plays this game ? \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:21 pm | Yes the us gov should cut it all along with the 30 billions to israel . \nThat way the us will stop sticking it 's nose too much in the middle east I think egypt is changed now and you ca n't buy it 's ppl decions anymore . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:21 pm | Am so tired of my government holding up leaders who trample on the rights of their citizens ... it 's not about being on the right side of history but doing what is right . \nWithhold our aid to the military until the people of Egypt are guaranteed and conduct free and fair elections . \nWe do n't need to endorse anyone , we do n't need to involve ourselves any further than just making sure no one is jailed or tortured . . \nsomething amazing might actually happen , people in the region might be more inclined to support us in the long run if we do ... February 1 , 2011 at 5:21 pm | The US should not threaten to withhold aid to Egypt so quickly . \nIf Mubarak continues to defy the will of the people , the US should consider alternative means or accounts in which to deposit the foreign aid funds . \nMeanwhile , why are we so quick to talk about withholding aid from Egypt , when we continue to send aid to Israel without conditions . \nWhy not make US aid to Israel contingent on Israel ceasing to build homes on the West Bank ? \nThese guys need to get there act together . \nWith this money Mubarak has used the military to get rid of anything that might threaten him . \nWe need to stop funding as a threat until they agree to give all reasonable rights to citizens . \nThey should be forced to hold a fair election immediately or not receive aid . \nWe ca n't allow oil shipping through the Suez canal to control us . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:21 pm | Witholding aid at this time would be grossly unproductive . \nThe USA would become the target for general Egyptian populace anger and would sully relations for years to come . \nThis would be seen as direct interference in Egyptian internal affairs . \nWhat would the US populace and officials feel should major investing countries started withdrawing their funds from US entities en masse ? \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:22 pm | February 1 , 2011 at 5:22 pm | Stating that United States ' $ 1.5 Bn aid `` controls the purse-strings '' in Egypt is bit of a stretch . \nEgypt 's GDP is $ 470Bn -LRB- 2009 -RRB- and $ 500Bn -LRB- 2010 , est -RRB- - so $ 1.5 Bn of aid from US to Egypt accounts for less than 0.3 % . \nHardly controlling any purse-strings , when put it perspective . \nArguably , the decline of tourism - which accounts for 5-6 % of Egypt 's GDP - is a far bigger hit to its purse strings than any cutback of US aid . \nAt a time when their economy will be severely pressured , cutting back US aid would only serve to further antagonize the US image in this Arab nation . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:22 pm | Deb K in snowy MA Why should we give 1.5 billion to Egypt , when we 're not taking care of people in our own country ? \nWhen will the US government realize it 's time to take share the false wealth right here in the good ol US ; for the folks who are going without health care and a good education . \nWhy do we continue to risk US bankruptcy to take care of other countries . \nIt 's time to start taking better care of all the families who really need it here ; who continually go without the goodies we provide for other countries . \nJack , we need to look at the larger question . \nWe have repeatedly sent money to prop up oppressive regimes who generally conduct their affairs to please us . \nWe pay no attention to how they treat their own people . \nMubarak is just the latest in a long string of these train wrecks . \nIt results in oppressed people hating the USA and doing us far more harm than the perceived good that our money has bought . \nWe should not ask if we are going to withhold funds from Mubarak . \nWe should ask what our policy should be and get to it . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:22 pm | Yes , not only stop the Foreign Aide to Egypt but to all countries around the world . \nLets start to spend the US taxpayer money on the US and rebuilding this country 's infrastructure ; creating job opportunites for our citizens who are out of work ; stop the decline of our educational systems and help stop so many citizens falling into poverty . \nIf we do not clean up our own act , I fear you will see the revolt in Egypt coming to the streets of major US cities soon . \nWe are becoming a country of have and have nots with the number of have not growing fast and the unrest is growing here as well . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:22 pm | Well , Jack , i do n't think we know to whom we should to send the money ! \nThe government in Egypt 48 hours from now is very likely not to be the government that is there right now . \nThe only responsible move is surely to withhold aid until we see who we 're dealing with . \nCris in New Freedom PA February 1 , 2011 at 5:22 pm | What 's President Obama waiting for ? \ntake the scissors and cut through that aid to about 50 % until the America economy picks up . \nWhen Americans are asked to tighten their belt , others need to do the same with exception of humanitarian\\/economic aid . \nIt 's about time the government redirects its aid to positive causes not military especially in hard times . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:22 pm | Jose Gomez from Binghamton , NY Yes Jack , all aid should be withheld everywhere that has an authoritarian political system . \nThere is absolutely no reason why the United States should give money to cruel , corrupt dictators for no reason , even if they are supportive of US interests -LRB- or the puppet state Israel 's interests -RRB- . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:22 pm | Now , after 30 + years of supporting a virtual dictatorship , the U.S. suddenly wants to attach conditions of democratic elections , free and open media , fair courts ? \nI do n't understand how , suddenly , certain members of Congress can be so concerned for those basic principles of democracy , when they never said a thing when Mubarak was in power . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:22 pm | Yes , and while we at it lets cut some of the billions we give to Israel February 1 , 2011 at 5:22 pm | The world will be a better place if we stop using taxpayers money to support Israel 's occupation of Arabs land and to ignore united nations resolutions . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:22 pm | Mitch Dworkin - Dallas , Texas The U.S. in my opinion should temporarily withhold its $ 1.5 billion in financial aid to Egypt until there is some kind of a peaceful and reasonable resolution to the crisis that most Egyptians and the U.S. government find acceptable . \nI do not think that blank checks can be given to any country when we do not know who its leaders will be and if it could possibly be taken over by radical Muslim extremists . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:22 pm | Good gosh , is there anyone we are not giving money to ? . \nAmerica needs health care , better schools , updated infastructure , I could go on and on listing the needs of our country ... . \nNo wonder we are in debt . \nStop the money NOW . \nYou dont loan money you dont have -LRB- PERIOD -RRB- . \nNow is the time to rebuilt our relationship with these countries without giving them $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:23 pm | By all means NO ! \nMubarak has been an Allie of ours for a long time and has help to keep the region very stable that is what our money bought , remember when George Bush got involved and called for elections in Palestine who did the people elect Hamas , We need to let this process play out , let the Egyptian people decide the direction they want , an orderly transition would be preferable but to force our will may be to our peril , remember Iran and Komeni . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:23 pm | Jack the U.S Should not stick there noses to deep into this transition of Democracy ... Although the U.S Should cut aid to Egypt if Mubarak is removed as President ! \nFor the simple reason the Country of Egypt will become a haven for Terrorists and who knows if it will become a Lawless Country ... February 1 , 2011 at 5:23 pm | The US should withhold every single penny until Mubarak stops reshuffling the deck and resigns . \nEgypt is not comprised of President Mubarak , but rather of 80 million citizens that , currently , respect America and its interests . \nHowever , protesters are being fired upon with tear gas canisters stamped with `` Made in the USA '' while they chant for their dictator 's removal . \nThe best for the US to win 80 million new enemies is to continue to fund the regime . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:23 pm | Only if it becomes clear without a doubt that Mubarak is not serious about stepping down before any election campaign starts . \nIt is possible that some kind of ` manageable ' stalemate could continue for months if not weeks without much fundamental movement from either side . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:23 pm | The USA is giving aid to grantee the safety of Israel before anything else . \nThe USA should stop aid for now . \nLater , when everything settle , they should consider why they are giving that money away . \nEgyptians would appreciate it if that money is used in rebuilding Egypt . \nYou should make it obvious that any help offered is because the USA cares not because anything else . \nTry not to involve Israel in it . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:23 pm | Why do we always give aid to these other countries when we are in trouble ourselves . \nI am sick of being treated like an ATM !!! I lost a tooth to scurvy due to being out of work and not enough to eat for over a year . \nWhere was the government when it was my turn for a little help until I could get back on my feet ? \nI was the wrong class , wrong color and not here illegally from Mexico . \nI still have the hole in my mouth because I ca n't afford a bridge or healthcare . \nMaybe I could afford these necessities if the government would take it 's friggin ' hand out of my pocket ! \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:23 pm | You are damned straight to with hold any $ to Egypt . \nThat money could better be used to help the hungry children in the US or the elderly who are n't eating healthy food and are suffering the effects resulting in draining Medicare through frequent doc 's office visits\\/hospitalization . \nThese cost come back to tax payers . \nYes , Egypt needs help but no free rides and that should apply to many , many countries in that area -LRB- Israel being the most costly -RRB- . \nThere must be demands following aid -- which has not been the case so far . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:23 pm | I think the US officials who were watching Egypt should have recommended banning that money a long time ago . \nMubarak has n't been running Egypt like a President . \nHe was running the country more like a Pharaoh , including using a secret police force that could beat up anybody they did n't like . \nI think the US should not give Egypt any more money until we find out what the new government will be . \nIt 's obvious Mubarak was n't using the money to help his people and as a taxpayer , I do n't want to give the Egyptian government any more money unless I know what 's going to be done with it . \nI 'm in financial distress myself and I 'd rather see the money being used to help Americans instead of corrupt foreign govrenments . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:23 pm | The problem with arming other countries , is the chance that they turn on us down the road . \nThat is a chance we choose to take in exchange for our interests to be taking serious by some of these so-called friendly regimes . \nI think we should see where this goes a little longer before we do something drastic . \nTheir attention needs to be on getting it together instead of worrying about external problems right now . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:24 pm | Much of the yearly aid we give to Egypt and Israel is a bribe so the two countries will refrain from attacking each other . \nIf we are not willing to threaten Israel with the same economic sanctions for their actions , like their illegal settlement building , then we would look like hypocrites to the rest of the world by threatening Egypt with a loss of aid . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:24 pm | ABSOLUTELY ! \nWe should not only withhold aid from Egypt , but maybe even ALL foreign aid funding , at least for a temporary basis . \nWith Americans losing their homes , jobs and eventually their minds , It seems we go out of our way help every any country but our own in these trying times . \nI know it 's likely easier said than done , but if I recall , the saying goes , `` charity starts at home . '' \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:24 pm | USA seems to forget that this aid goes to the military , the most respected and most reliable force in Egypt . \nand the latest events have prooved that to be true . \nYou do not stop fueling a car just because there is a malfunction in it ! \nthis aid is a must unless the USA is willing to see another Iran on her hands . \nHolding back the aid that America gives every year will not help the situation . \nRather it would depict to the Egyptian people that the west is leaving their side entirely . \nKeep in mind that that the aid that America gives plays a vital role to us here in the U.S.A. it 's in our best interest in my opinion to leave that channel open , and to maintain a good relationship with a crucial ally that we have in that region . \nThere are other ways for America to get involved rather than pulling funds from underneath them , especially during this moment we are in . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:24 pm | Withhold aid to Egypt ? \nHow about end aid permanently , along with aid to all other countries ? \nThe fact that we are running trillion dollar deficits while at the same time sending money to other countries is absolutely mindboggling . \nAnd the entangling alliances this `` aid '' -LRB- much of it military -RRB- will only lead to creating further enemies , as I 'm sure the `` Made in the USA '' tear gas cannisters already are . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:24 pm | Jack , Well I agree that the people of Egypt deserve a democratic government and the chance of a better life , i do n't feel that the US should get involved . \nIt 's like the parents of an adult child butting into their life , it only causes hard feelings . \nDemocracy is something that must be won and fought for , we did it and now it is time for Egypt to fight . \nI also fear removing funding from the military could lead to safety issues for the people of Egypt . \nLet the funding stand . \nLet the people of Egypt do this on their own . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:24 pm | I think the American aid to Egypt will not play big part in the current events , Egyptian did not feel any good from this money , second Mubarak does not care neither , he until today disrespecting his people , he was talking to them but the have no communications with the outside world , no phone no internet and no transportation , and nor allowing the journalist to report from Egypt , that add to the lest of no freedom of speech freedom of press and no freedom of Assembly . \nhow can he be trusted when he was the master of fraud and forgery in every election presidential or NDP , He is malty billionaire and so is his kids and wife , basically the 1.5 was just to keep him in the office , February 1 , 2011 at 5:24 pm | We need to slow down . \nLet the professionals in the State and Defense Departments have time to work with the Egyptians and suggest ways to approach the current problems . \nMoney matters and is a powerful tool . \nLet us use it with a surgeon 's skill not a like a baseball bat . \nThis is time for thinking , gathering information , consultation and looking at alternative solutions . \nDoing so quietly behind the scenes will benefit us all . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:25 pm | We need to demonstrate to the people of Egypt that we are with them in this time of difficulty . \nWe also need to demonstrate to all of Islam that Obama meant what he said warning current regimes not to get in the way of democratic reforms . \nOur nation is only as good as its word and Obama has already given our word to support reform . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:25 pm | YES . . \nWhy America always in a hurry 2 help other countries when we need help the most do n't see a lot of countries sending us 1.5 dollar . . \nSo many americans have no jobs , no places to live . \nWE R BROKE and in DEBT ... yet want 2 send all that money to another country R u kidding ME ? \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:25 pm | Only unnecessary aid , yet we should withhold any amount that was going into Mubaraks pocket . \nIf we added up the amount of unnecessary aid we supply to other countries our debt could be brought down significantly . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:25 pm | As sports , hamburger and fries are a given in our country , ` bartering ' is as strong , in most if not all middle east countries . \nThe art of the deal is manifest in all negotiations , especially in mid-east politics . \nPuting pressure on the Military 's income stream , as in our current potential withdrawal of Egypts 1.5 bln foreign aid pkg from the U.S. , will transfer up the ` political ' chain from the Egyptian military leadership to Mubarak in short order . \nUltimately , defining who really has the power in Egypt . \nTheir Military is more likely to make a better ` deal ' with Mubarak then any U.S. attempt to reason a new paradigm . \nWe need to learn how to play their brand of hard ball in which friendship takes a side seat when ` push ' needs to become ` shove ' . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:25 pm | The Whitehouse is reviewing the aid dependent on the Army 's behavior . \nWhat that means is that if the Army opens fire on the people , they know that the US will cut off the aid . \nThat is an appropriate ` threat ' to make . \nFor those on this site who are claiming that the aid should be withdrawn in general -- because we are in debt , they need to consider what would happen to the price of oil if the suez canal was cut off . \nThat billion in aid saves us billions more than what it costs . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:25 pm | Then we should apply the same rule to Israel as well . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:26 pm | We should absolutely continue all of our foreign aid to Egypt . \nFor 30 years we 've propped up the oppressive policies of this regime against the people of Egypt , we are now obligated to support the people as they attempt to form a free democracy . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:26 pm | The US needs to pick sides : we 're either with Mubarak or with the people . \nThe protests ca n't go on forever . \nThreatening to or actually witholding aid to Egypt will be picking the people 's side . \nIn any case , the world can not afford to let these protests fade away . \nBy doing so , Mubarak will make Tianamen Square look like child 's play as soon as all this international attention subsides . \nPick a side , USA !!! And pick the people 's side , because Mubarak wo n't be there forever ; the people will . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:26 pm | If we the US tax payer are to believe our elected officials ... some who say that we need to scrap a much needed HCR legislation , because it is tooooooo expensive and we cant afford it ... yet we can borrow $ 1.5 Billion to give Egypt to prop up there egotistical leader who doesnt know when to leave ... I am betting Mubarak has a pretty good chunk of that $ 1.5 Billion in a Swiss bank account somewhere ... . \nMy elected officials better get a grip and start cutting off all the money we borrow and give away ... and start fixing some of our own problems ... February 1 , 2011 at 5:26 pm | This is a complete travesty . \nNot only the fact that our government is going so broke it ca n't even pay Income tax returns on time but we have plenty of money to bid the passage of our liquid gold . \nBecause how else will we keep Americans in financial Holocaust we are all in now if we ca n't use this travesty to make record breaking profits in the Oil market . \nShould we withhold money from Egypt ? \nI think we should withhold it forever from everyone . \nLets fight for a Democracy in America . \nI would love to see the day This REPUBLIC dies and is replaced my a true Democracy . \nThe fact that Americans are losing everything Egypt is just a window into our future . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:27 pm | I believe - u.S. should n't hold back any aid as this will make live for the common Egyptian even harder . \nThis will give HM another excuse to why he ca n't invest in new jobs and better educational institutions . \nIt might also give religious extremist -LRB- of any religion -RRB- wind in their sails if they were to take advantage of the situation February 1 , 2011 at 5:27 pm | No. . \nWe should not interfere in any way to what is happening in Egypt . \nThere revolution might just stumble on to a system of Government that is not controlled by a central authority which could enlighten us all and lead us to a better world . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:27 pm | Heck yes , for the time being we should stop everything going to Egupt . \nThey all need to grow-up , because situations for the good does n't happen over night , a new government will not be able to square that country away over night , that is impossible . \nLet them take care of themselves , we as a country needs to stop sticking our nose in evertwhere else , we have to many problems here . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:27 pm | The friendship of United States with most countries is ` frienship with mutual benefits ' . \nTo keep Egypt as an ally , the aid must continue . \nIs n't it a give and take situation ? \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:27 pm | Yes ! \nIf we ca n't stand strong on our core principle of universal human rights then what do we stand for . \nThe people have clearly spoken and Mubarak must leave . \nBring in the UN and whatever other bodies to bridge the transition to a functional democracy . \nThere is no other principled option . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:28 pm | How typically self deceptive ! \nThe U.S. no more `` controls Egypt 's purse strings '' than it controls sun spots on the moon . \nWhat the U.S. does is subsidize the U , S , arms industry by permitting Egypt to purchase with the weapons of oppression that Mubarak has used to oppress the people of Egypt . \nWhat we have here is a supreme case of blow back over which the empire has no control . \nDo what it wishes the U.S. has no control over the righteous actions of the people . \nWhen the time for an idea has come not even the empire can stop it America 's historic hypocrisy has already been unmasked ! \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:28 pm | The U.S. should hold all of the $ 1.5 billion in financial aid to Egypt until they ask for it and when that time comes we can sit down at the table with them without it appearing we are interferring in their affairs . \nWithholding financial aid is the only bargaining power we have and we should use it at all cost . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:28 pm | The good Egyptian people have sacrificed a lot to get to this point . \nHow can we expect them to want Mubarak to stay in power any longer to continue to murder and take revenge on them . \nWe must put ourselves in their place . \nWe are afraid that an anti-American regime will replace him . \nThe longer we continue to anger the Egyptian people by refusing to help them in their time of need , the more likely that will become a self-fulfilling prophesy ! \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:30 pm | NO , this is the time when the money is most needed !! Once Mubarak is out of his position , this money is necessary for both the cleanup of the country and the construction of the new government . \nHowever , rather than throw one and a half billion dollars into the hands of this government , we should personally choose to which areas the money should be allocated . \nThis will close the huge gap between the upper class and lower class that is present there now . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:30 pm | This would put pressure on the military to force Mubarak out . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:30 pm | In response to a couple of other commenters re this foreign aid question relative to our own countrys ' financial situation ... think of it as an insurance policy guaranteeing the continued use of the all important Suez Canal ... we all ` gots ' to pay to play . \nIts always been that way and will undoubtedly continue to be so . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:30 pm | Very Interesting ... we with hold the money unless they do it the American way . . \nSort of reminded me of a saying `` what if a man gains the whole world but loses his soul '' . \nWe have been sending money to many countries , while our own country has been crumbling both in government and structures . \nHow long will it bee before our youth wake up ... February 1 , 2011 at 5:31 pm | Withholding $ 1.5 billion from Egypt 's military is peanuts Jack . \nAmerica spends more than that in daily interest on our national debt so withholding $ 1.5 billion from the Egyptian military would be like telling Obama his going to the Super Bowl if the Bears were playing , would have cost taxpayers millions for his security . \nSo , no Jack , America needs to continue sending Egypt money so long as we 're both on the same page . \nThe friendship of United States with most countries is ` frienship with mutual benefits ' . \nTo keep Egypt as an ally irrespective of the regime in power , the aid must continue . \nIs n't it a give and take situation ? \nWhen you have a majority of the countries citizens protesting an all too corrupt regime , you probably should n't pick a side . \nWe are not the worlds police . \nIt seems the military has picked a side and it dose n't appear to be president Mubaric 's . \nThey are essentially Egypt 's police now and certainly can make that choice . \nIf you gave a handfull of money to a church or a charity , could you simply take it back if they did n't spend it the way you expected ? \nI do n't think so . \nThe money is theirs . \nWe should not even consider that move . \nI am all to sad that americans can feel so much passion for our country but will not go out on the streets as a `` majority '' to protest what we believe in . \nIt would seem to be the patrotic thing to do . \n`` Decention of government is the greatest form of patriotism . '' \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:32 pm | We need to stop borrowing money from china to give to Egypt , Jordan , Lebanon , Pakistan . . \nAnd all other foreign countries . \nsenator Dirksen had it right : a billion here a billion there , it all adds up . \nwe ca n't afford to bankroll the world on borrowed money al February 1 , 2011 at 5:32 pm | Should the US keep giving aid to the Egyptian government ? \nNot just because the country does n't honor the wishes of it 's people by demanding its President step down ... The U.S. is BROKE financially . \nNow is the ideal time to end ALL foreign aid to ALL countries . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:32 pm | Absolutely . \nWe should n't be facilitating or paying for oppression and violations of basic human rights . \nBut to be fair , and to avoid the appearance of hypocrisy or double standards , especially in the Arab and Muslim World , we should also cut the nearly $ 2 Billion we give Israel until that government adheres to all relevant UN Security Council resolutions calling for Israeli to withdraw from Palestine to its 1967 borders and all relevant international laws such as the Fourth Geneva Convention which prohibits collective punishment and building ` settlements ' on occupied territory . \nAfter all , Palestinians are just as deserving of freedom and self-determination as Egyptians . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:32 pm | The people want too be able to eat half of that carrot . \nCan you blame those that are hungry ? \nWho would it hurt to give half the carrot away ? \nGranger 's suggestion of withholding aid if there 's evidence that U.S. military equipment is being used improperly is utterly laughable . \nIs this a position suggested in the case of Israel utilizing US weapons against Palestians , with documented cases in the abuse of power ? \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:34 pm | The US should not withhold any of the aid . \nSuch a move will increase the chances of instability in Egypt which is ultimately not in the US interest . \nTo the contrary , the US should temporarily increase aid during this critical period in order to ease the tension and improve teh chances for a stable and democratic Egypt . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:34 pm | The good Egyptian people have sacrificed a lot to get to this point . \nHow can we expect them to want Mubarak to stay in power any longer to continue to murder and take revenge on them . \nWe must put ourselves in their place . \nThe best way we can help them is to withold our aid . \nWe are afraid that an anti-American regime will replace him . \nThe longer we continue to anger the Egyptian people by refusing to help them in their time of need , the more likely that will become a self-fulfilling prophesy ! \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:34 pm | Thye U.S. should continue with the aid to Egypt and may be even increase it to nurture the budding democracy in Egypt . \nJust think how much money and american blood was expended to create a so called model democracy in Iraq . \nDemocracy in Egypt is developing without the spillage of one drop of American blood . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:34 pm | With 40 % of the Egyptian population living on an income of $ 2.00 per day ... with Egypt boasting highest unemployment in the world amongst young , educated people ... aid and support is needed , but NOT for the military . \nMubarek , the U.S. , and the world need to `` listen '' ... really `` listen to understand '' what these passioned people are saying . \nI heard one protester on CNN say `` We have 2 choices ~ 1 -RRB- Remove Mubarak or This militaristic rule is not creating freedom . \nOur own leadership is blind , as Joe Biden does not see `` Mubarek '' as a dictator ... The U.S. and others need to rendezvous with leaders and support `` ways and means '' financially and otherwise to create jobs , life , hope , value ... February 1 , 2011 at 5:35 pm | We are broke ! \nI find it difficult to understand why we borrow money from one foreign country and give it to another . \nAs usual we are left holding the bag and get very little bang for our bucks . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:35 pm | 82 % of the Egyptians `` hate ' America for its Israeli support . \nIt means that an Islamist regime there may be quite possible . \nYou know very well what that ongoing financial support will be used for in such a case ! . \nBetter be very , very careful and consider to keep those funds at home . \nPerhaps it may help in finding jobs for a few nationally un - employed here . \nIn any case , we ` re in a MESS . \nWe should n't be facilitating or paying for oppression and violations of basic human rights . \nBut to be fair , and to avoid the appearance of hypocrisy or double standards , especially in the Arab and Muslim World , we should also cut the nearly $ 2 Billion we give Israel until that government adheres to all relevant UN Security Council resolutions calling for Israel to withdraw from Palestine to its 1967 borders and all relevant international laws such as the Fourth Geneva Convention which prohibits collective punishment and building ` settlements ' on occupied territory . \nAfter all , Palestinians are just as deserving of freedom and self-determination as Egyptians . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:35 pm | Withhold our tax dollars from all the dictators , keep it in the US and not in those dictator 's swiss accounts February 1 , 2011 at 5:36 pm | what are we seeing now Jack is a great era , we do not wanna miss the opportunity of join the freedom march in that part of the world , we believe in democracy in the united stats and is it heart warming to see this movement , people not motivated with any religion believe , looking at the administrator tell the story poor middle class youth and young children and old man and amazingly women young and old , that is a new face of democracy , we need to support them not reject them and frustrate them , good bless us all and bless the once that support the freedom here and there February 1 , 2011 at 5:36 pm | Taxpayers ' money should be shared only with people who share taxpayers ' values and principles . \nMubarak is clearly not one of them . \nOrdinary Egyptians may be . \nBut , the only way to get to those people is through community and civil society channels , not through corrupt military or ruthless leaders who abuse those very legitimate recipients . \nJack , Egypt & Israel , as part of the treaty they both signed years ago , both recieve money from The U.S. to `` keep the peace '' and so far , it 's been working fine . \nThe trouble starts when a group of prople who are anti-Israel want `` change '' and they begin to stir up the people to do their dirty work for them and that 's what is happening in Egypt now . \nThe Muslim Brotherhood is behind this bogus `` uprising '' , not the people . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:36 pm | Not only should we start witholding money from Egypt but we should start witholding it from Israel and virtually any other country we send military aid to . \nDefense and defense related spending , including things like military aid , eats up $ 1.3 trillion dollars a year ! \nYet no politicians are even thinking about touching that to reduce the deficit . \nJust between Egypt and Israel we could cut a billion dollars and they would still have a Shiite-load of weapons they can use to kill each other . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:37 pm | Why do n't we strike a bargain with the Arab world , we will continue aid if they drop oil prices to a realistic level for the American people . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:37 pm | What really puzzules me is we are in so much debt and so much unimployment , and yet we can afford to give so much money to these other countries . \nHow can we contiue to borrow money only to give it to other contries . \nWhat about , charity begins at home ! \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:37 pm | America gave over 2.4 BILLION to the Jews in Israel in 2007 . \nThe top recipient of all Foregin aid . \nGive the Egyptian their aid . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:38 pm | There seem to be a lot of tea party types here that are saying we should not supply aid to Egypt because it should be used to pay down debt . \nIt is the perfect example of their absolute ignorance . \nAsk them back , Jack , how much money we save by having our ships travel via the Suez Canal rather than going all the way around Africa . \nOr how about considering what it would cost us in oil prices were the Mid East to collapse into chaos ? \nThe Tea Party people are idiots . \nThat 's why they vote for people like Bachmann and Palin . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:38 pm | We are all bound together in this planet . \nI applaud the Egyptian people and hope that their cohesion against tyranny is felt way beyond the Middle East . \nWhat affects Egypt will affect us in one way or another regardless of whether or not we continue to give them the 1.5 B in aid . \nIf the Republicans want to cut costs , then here is a place to start . \nAh but wait !!! It 's going to cut into the sales of defense equipment to Egypt and other Middle Eastern nations . \nWould the Republican want to stifle capitalism ???? Of course not ! \nThen in all good fashion , Republicans will continue to send the aid even at the expense of providing aid to it 's own people here in the US . \nAfter all , it 's the mighty dollar that speaks not the poor or marginalized in this country . \nIf Republicans truly want to uphold their `` principles '' of cutting the deficit , then start with this miniscule amount which symbolically has great weight . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:40 pm | This is a complete travesty . \nNot only the fact that our government is going so broke we ca n't even afford to pay income tax returns on time but we have plenty of money to bid the passage of our liquid gold . \nHow else will Americans be able to be held in financial Slavery we are all in now chained to the pump . \nWhat will Corporate America do if they ca n't use this travest to make record breaking profits in the oil market . \nEgypt is just a window into the future of America . \nYou can only bend something so far before it breaks . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:40 pm | Stop the money ? \nIt is a no brainer ! . \n`` Show me the money '' is always the way to go . \nThirty years and Mubarak is still in his castle and the people are in sheds and tents . \nFinally the internet has shown these people how the rest of the world lives and they want a piece of it . \nLet freedom ring !!!! February 1 , 2011 at 5:40 pm | Terry - Greensburg , IN `` Hoosier Hillbilly '' Should the U.S. withhold any of its $ 1.5 billion in financial aid to Egypt ? \nWe owe $ 14 Trillion dollars in national debt , is it our place to continue to provide the rest of the world with weapons and good Samaritan money for the rest of the world to squander ? \nI think `` WE '' should think this scenario over before doing anything for anybody except ourselves . \nIt 's always been my feeling that charity begins @ home ! \nAnd I 'm sure ` our ' government thinks the same way , if they want to give some of their earnings to foreign governments - more power to them -- but ` our ' tax dollars need to go toward getting -LRB- -LRB- RID -RRB- -RRB- of debt ! \nASAP !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I 'm not saying they caused any of it , but then again I think `` Well maybe '' they did ! \nWhat 's happened to ` our ' dollar and who had a part in it ? \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:41 pm | This is strange its like the US was saying `` Hay Mubarak here is your money . \nWe dont really care what your population thinks '' before ... and now that protestors are taking to the streets its like they are saying `` Ooh it looks like you are unpopular and its all in the world public eye now . \nSorry Mubarak we now need to show the world that we care what your people think '' ... its just so daft ... Hmm February 1 , 2011 at 5:41 pm | Egypt receives $ 1.5 billion in foreign aid as a result of the Camp David accords ... it was one of the way 's the US convinced Egypt to accept Israel . \nThe US should not withhold any of the $ 1.5 billion , but instead should redirect the distribution of these funds . \nThe Egyptian military has amassed a considerable sum of foreign aid over the years since the accord was signed in 1979 . \nEven though the military continues to have a large impact on this movement the foreign aid which the U.S. sends to Egypt should be redistributed to help meet the demands and needs of the people . \nIf the money is redistributed into work programs and salaries for civil servants , a greater majority of the younger population will have an opportunity to for employment . \nNonetheless , the money should not be withheld , but redirected in a manor that will help the ` revolutionaries ' and a new Egyptian government meet the peoples demands . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:41 pm | If we cut off aid to Egypt because they do n't follow our ideals when it comes to a lack of rights to citizens then how about that country that fails to allow a certian ethnic population to own property in certain parts of their nation . \n, February 1 , 2011 at 5:42 pm | Right now , any aid would go to the bad guys , no ? \nI say hustle up an honest government , then go for it ! \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:42 pm | We should keep our money . \nIt is sad that we have to ask that question . \nWe do not need to buy friends with our financial situation . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:43 pm | People are saying that we should not pay money to sponsor an Islamist government that will surely rise out of Egypt , but the Egyptian people are not composed fully of Muslims , and even less by radicals . \nGiving aid to them would be support of a new government , and by donating , we are given a say in how the government is formed . \nEgypt is a main ally of ours in the area , and making them hostile towards us is not a solution . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:44 pm | I believe funds should be withheld in support of the Egyptian people until Mubarak agrees to leave , and agrees to elections as soon as possible , allows banned candidates to run , immediately lifts the state of emergency that 's been in place for decades , releases political prisoners , and allows for freedom of the media and assembly . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:45 pm | No. . \nFor God 's sake , just go out and ask this dictator to leave , and assure the Egyptians that you will support them and work with any government they chose . \nIt 's too late for this dictator to say anything to change people 's view of him , and soon it will be too late for the US . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:46 pm | No ! \nthis is the time when the money is most needed !! Once Mubarak is out of his position , this money is necessary for both the cleanup of the country and the construction of the new government . \nHowever , rather than throw one and a half billion dollars into the hands of this government , we should personally choose to which areas the money should be allocated . \nThis will close the huge gap between the upper class and lower class that is present there now . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:49 pm | All foreign aid must stop !! We are broke and borrowing it , how stupid are we to continue doing it !! I think we need to continue to honor the treaties that we put together . \nTo walk away now would do more damage . \nWe had better be on good terms with whomever becomes President there . \nAnd to do that , just do n't meddle . \nSupport them in other ways , but do n't meddle in the construction of their new government . \nBesides our meddling after WWII is the reason that we 're at this point in the first place . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:50 pm | most of us dont care what happens elsewhere . \nI just wish that are damn government would stop feeding us BS get things done and get this freakin nation back to hiring people in all fields . \nThis is suppose to be the greatest place in the world . \nWell Im a 99er with years of exp . \nand havent found work yet . \nAs screwed up as this country is and my credit , I cant get a loan to start a business . \nSo this directed at YOU president Obama What am I to do because Im losing my patients with this country and YOU . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:51 pm | STOP the madness . \nI do n't have any money , mine all goes to taxes , federal , sales , estate , income , dividends , you name it , health insurance -LRB- astronamical -RRB- , etc. , etc. . \nWHY the HE !! should we send anything to anyone , WHAT have any of them ever done for us . \nIt 's been a one way street since the end of World War II . \nENOUGH ALREADY !!! February 1 , 2011 at 5:53 pm | It 's our money to do what we want with . \nSo , yes , if it can not be spent to protect our interests , it should be withheld . \nAfter all , it is basically a shake down . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:54 pm | Principled change is the key word . \nPrincipled change means that health services , protection of food and fuel supplies , protection of routes of transportation ... in other words any programs that ensure the safety of the Egyptian people should not be cut by American generosity to the Egyptian people . \nThe answer is : if aid continues , is there a way for Obama to specify that any funds now will be distributed to those that will ensure that the people receive the funds for programs that ensure there safety , through the transition . \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:54 pm | If the money is supporting Mubarak , then temporary and conditional withdraw of the money is a non-violent way to pressure him to leave . \nIf we do not put pressure , I would not be surprised if this escalated to more violence than we have already seen . \nIf the money is helping support the people seeking reform as Coral said , then I agree we could hurt their effort . \nThe question is whether withdrawing the money will help or hinder the people in revolt . \nThere are times that risks are worth taking . \nThe question is do the costs outweigh the benefits . \nIs there enough potential for success and has the effectiveness of this strategy been thoroughly weighed ? \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:55 pm | Please note that the $ 1.3 billion a year to Egypt is part of the Camp David Agreement of 1979 and is tied to the assistance to Israel . \nYou may want to suggest that the assistance be conditioned on democratic changes in Egypt . \nRaouf Youssef , Vienna , Virginia February 1 , 2011 at 5:57 pm | Should we cut off aid to Egypt just because the people of Egypt are trying to get rid of a dictator ? \nShould we cut off aid to Egypt because almost all of it goes towards military and weapons infrastructure ? \nFebruary 1 , 2011 at 5:59 pm | to many times we have given aid in volatile situations i think we should drag our feet until we see who comes to power we are already giving aid to the Taliban in afghanistan I 'm sure with the regime there watch slowly watch carefully February 1 , 2011 at 6:03 pm | February 1 , 2011 at 6:03 pm | Jack Cafferty sounds off hourly on the Situation Room on the stories crossing his radar . \nNow , you can check in with Jack online to see what he 's thinking and weigh in with your own comments online and on TV . \nWould you ride in a car that drives itself ? \nIs she the answer ? \nShould the #LoneStarState be allowed to withdraw from U.S. ? \n"}

'' \nBohn said although she 's been unable to make outgoing international calls , she can receive them . \n`` It 's been completely demobilizing , and , of course , that 's the whole point , '' she said . \nShe said she has not felt any danger or hostility toward Americans from demonstrators . \n`` They 're embracing me on the ground and embracing people on the ground , '' Bohn said . \n`` They want to make sure that the U.S. government is hearing them . '' \nIf we still want to have Egypt as a strong ally in a Middle East , we must support brave Egyptian people in their fight for the freedom and demonstrate them what our President stated in his speech in Cairo , we really mean it . \nLaura is in the majority vote . \nI am not so sure I support the demonstrators . \nTheir eyes show so much hate . \nWhat if the Egyptian people turn against us ? \nWhat if they support anti-American leaders that want war with Israel . \nThe start of WW111 ???

'' \nand `` The people want the president to be judged ! '' \nSome waved shoes in the air -- a deep insult in the Arab world -- and said they would continue their demonstrations until Mubarak quits outright . \nMohamed ElBaradei , the Nobel Peace Prize winner who has become a leading opposition figure , said Mubarak 's decision was `` an act of deception '' that would only `` extend the agony . '' \nEgypt protests threaten global economy At a glance : Nations facing unrest `` Whoever gave him that advice gave him absolutely the wrong advice , '' ElBaradei said . \nHowever , Arab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa , a former Egyptian foreign minister , said demonstrators should weigh what Mubarak has said before responding . \n`` I 'm aware that there are certain currents in Egypt that will not see that as satisfactory and they need more , '' Moussa , a possible presidential contender himself , told CNN . \nBut , he added , `` I believe that there is something new that has been offered . '' \nMubarak has led Egypt for nearly 30 years since the 1981 assassination of his predecessor , Anwar Sadat , aided by an emergency decree that has allowed him to rule with an iron fist . \nBut following demonstrations that have only grown in the past week , the 82-year-old former air force general told his people Tuesday night , `` I have spent enough time serving Egypt . \n`` I will pursue the transfer of power in a way that will fulfill the people 's demands , and that this new government will fulfill the people 's demands and their hopes for political , economic and social progress , '' he said . \nTuesday 's turnout in Cairo , Alexandria and other cities came despite efforts by the government to suspend rail service and cut off mobile phone and internet networks , and in spite of the mounting hardships facing Egyptians . \nBanks and schools have been shuttered during the demonstrations , teller machine screens are dark and gas stations have run out of fuel . \nLong lines snaked around bakeries and supermarkets as shops began to ration how much food customers could buy . \nIn Alexandria , protesters clashed with supporters of Mubarak , leaving 12 people injured , said Qutb Hassanein , a member of an opposition group . \nThe military was called in to restore calm . \nMohammed Mahmoud , a protester , said he was hit in the head by a stick during the clash . \n`` We do n't want him -LRB- Mubarak -RRB- . \nWe are staying here until we die , '' he said . \nMubarak 's announcement capped a day in which anti-government demonstrators stood shoulder-to-shoulder in Tahrir Square for a `` march of millions . '' \nIt comes less than three weeks after a wave of protests that forced Tunisia 's longtime strongman to flee to Saudi Arabia in mid-January . \nProtesters last week taunted , `` Mubarak , Saudi Arabia is waiting for you . '' \nBut despite calls for him to leave the country , the aging leader vowed Tuesday that `` This dear country is my country ... and I will die on its land . '' \nOpposition leader Ayman Nour called the speech `` very depressing . '' \nNour said Mubarak was already expected to step down at the end of his term -- but he is believed to be maneuvering to have his son , Gamal , succeed him . \nGoogle connects Egyptians to Twitter Zakaria : Mubarak is a ` dead man walking ' Mohammed Habib , deputy chairman of the officially banned Muslim Brotherhood , said Mubarak 's speech was built around emotional appeals to his decades of military service and the presidency . \n`` After 30 years during which corruption and diminishing the strategic role of Egypt in the region became the norm , I do not feel it is time to appeal for people 's emotion , '' Habib said . \n`` We should say ` thank you ' to him , ` and get out . ' '' \nIn Washington , President Barack Obama said he spoke with Mubarak soon after he announced he would not seek re-election . \nObama called for an orderly transition in Egypt that , he said , should be meaningful , peaceful and must begin now . \nThe U.S. president stressed the Egyptian people will be the ones to determine their own leaders and destiny . \nIn Cairo , the U.S. ambassador to Egypt , Margaret Scobey , met Tuesday with ElBaradei and will be speaking with leaders of other political movements , a senior State Department official said . \nThe official cautioned that Scobey 's talks with ElBaradei does n't mean the United States favors him . \nAs in Tunisia , the protests have been fueled by economic woes , including a dramatic rise in the cost of living coupled with high unemployment . \nDespite the government 's food subsidies , people are struggling , with an estimated 40 % of the country living in poverty . \nThe majority of Egypt 's population -- and the vast majority of its unemployed -- is under 30 , and many protesters are young men looking for economic opportunities and a better life . \nAs the demonstrations grew , Mubarak fired his cabinet and ordered newly appointed Vice President Omar Suleiman to hold talks on political reform with opposition leaders . \nAnd on Monday , the military -- the foundation of the modern Egyptian state -- announced it would not open fire on peaceful protesters . \n`` I think it 's all over with once the army makes that announcement , '' said Juan Cole , a Middle East historian at the University of Michigan . \nCole said he had expected the regime to endure the crisis with the support of the military , but that the military appears to have `` cut Mubarak loose . '' \nShibley Telhami , a University of Maryland professor and Brookings Institution analyst , said the military may have anchored the government but , `` At some point , they are going to have to make a decision about protecting the institution beyond the man . '' \nAnd Fouad Ajami , a Johns Hopkins University professor and Hoover Institution analyst , said Mubarak 's invocation of his years of service was `` almost pathetic . '' \n`` I believe the crowd was discovering its power as Mubarak was discovering his own weakness and the vulnerability of his own regime , '' Ajami said . \nNow , `` No one believes his promises , and now no one really believes his threats . '' \nThe demonstrations had turned ugly last Friday , when thousands of riot and plainclothes police used brutal force to crack down on people on the streets . \nUnconfirmed reports suggest up to 300 people may have been killed during the protests , U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said Tuesday . \nHuman Rights Watch has reported 80 deaths from two hospitals in Cairo , 36 in Alexandria and 13 in Suez . \nCNN has not been able to independently confirm the death toll . \nBut since the weekend , the army has replaced police as the enforcers of security , and the gatherings have been largely peaceful . \nIn recent days , protests inspired by the Tunisian outcome have spread to Algeria , Yemen , Jordan and Sudan . \nCalls for political reform prompted Jordan 's King Abdullah II Tuesday to dismiss his government and appoint a new prime minister , and a Facebook page urged similar demonstrations in Syria . \nJohn Entelis , director of Middle East studies at New York 's Fordham University , said the Arab world is facing a `` wave '' of unrest sparked by the Tunisian revolt . \n`` If it were not for Tunisia , none of this would be happening at this time or in this way , '' Entelis said . \nCNN 's John King , Ben Wedeman , Frederik Pleitgen , Ivan Watson , Housam Ahmed , Caroline Faraj , Salma Abdelaziz , Saad Abedine , Christine Theodorou , Zain Verjee , Arwa Damon and journalist Ian Lee contributed to this report \n"}

' \nThey 'd agree to confirm anything State Security wanted . '' \nThe words are those of one Egyptian speaking to Human Rights Watch - and alleging torture by Egypt 's security services against his fellow detainees . \nAnother man , a 22-year-old taxi-driver , told HRW last year about his detention by Egyptian police : `` They had whips and hit me on the legs , on the bottom of my feet , and on my back . \nWhen they took me down , they brought a black electric device and applied electro-shocks four or five times to my arms until it started smoking . '' \nThey are two of many cases documented by Human Rights Watch in a 96-page report on mistreatment of detainees in Egypt entitled `` Work On Him Until He Confesses : Impunity for Torture in Egypt . '' \nProtester : ` We 're here for the future ' ` Mubarak leaves ... or we die here ' The report , which was published Monday but compiled before the current unrest , concludes that the Egyptian security forces carry out torture and ill-treatment of detainees with impunity and the `` government is failing miserably to provide victims of torture and ill-treatment effective remedy . '' \nThe international human rights group says those guilty of human rights abuses have little expectation or reason to fear they will be held to account . \nIt cites the Egyptian government 's own figures that criminal courts convicted only six police officers of such abuses between 2006 and 2009 . \nThe Foreign Affairs Ministry reported to HRW that 10 other officers were acquitted , and three received suspended sentences . \nThe Interior Ministry said that it had reduced the salaries of 47 officers , suspended 17 , issued one warning and acquitted 11 . \nThere were at least 70 cases -LRB- some involving more than one officer -RRB- referred to the courts or a disciplinary tribunal during that period . \nIt 's not clear how many complaints are filed each year , but HRW said that human rights lawyers have documented numerous incidents that never reached court . \nThe Egyptian government told a U.N. panel in November 2009 that `` the Office of the Public Prosecutor investigates every complaint it receives about torture or cruel treatment . '' \nCNN was unable to get a response from the Egyptian government on the report . \nIn the event that officers are convicted of ill-treatment , the law does not provide meaningful penalties that might represent a deterrent , HRW said . \nAbuses are classified into three categories -- contraventions -LRB- a fine of less than US$ 17 or 100 Egyptian pounds -RRB- , misdemeanors -LRB- a fine of more than US$ 17 or a jail term -RRB- and felonies -LRB- prison , prison with hard labor or the death penalty -RRB- . \nTorture and `` assault leading to death '' are felonies ; cruelty and other categories of assault are classified as misdemeanors . \nAccording to the Egyptian penal code , any official `` who deliberately resorts , in the course of duty , to cruel treatment in order to humiliate or cause physical pain to another person shall be subject to a penalty of up to one year 's imprisonment or a fine of up to EGP200 -LRB- US$ 34 -RRB- -RRB- . '' \nEgyptian blogger helps organize protests The evolution of Egypt 's protests Zakaria : Mubarak is a ` dead man walking ' Egypt : Israeli intelligence got it wrong `` The result is an epidemic of habitual , widespread , and deliberate torture perpetrated on a regular basis by security forces against political dissidents , Islamists allegedly engaged in terrorist activity , and ordinary citizens suspected of links to criminal activity or who simply look suspicious , '' the report concludes . \nOne case highlighted by HRW is that of Khaled Said , a young businessman in Alexandria whose death prompted street protests last year against police brutality and has been a rallying cry in the current protests . \nHe was accosted by police at an Internet cafe because he had posted a video online allegedly showing police dividing up drugs seized in a bust . \nThe son of the cafe 's owner told HRW : `` They grabbed his head and banged it against the marble shelf . \nAt this point we tried to get them outside , thinking that they wanted to arrest him , but they dragged him into the entrance of the building next door ... They kicked him so hard that he fell on the stairs . \nThey held him by the throat and by the hair and banged his head against the stairs . '' \nAn official autopsy said Said died after swallowing a bag of drugs , but photographs of his body showed severe injuries . \nHuman Rights Watch says the State Security Investigations -LRB- SSI -RRB- is responsible for the disappearance of many people . \n`` SSI officers will summon individuals or arrest them , after which he or she `` disappears '' for a period of time , usually up to two or three months...Longer-term detention occurs at SSI headquarters in Cairo according to recent witness testimony and human rights groups . '' \nOne such detainee , according to his lawyers , was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood , Nasr al-Sayed Hassan Nasr , who was allegedly held blindfolded for 60 days last year . \nNasr told HRW that his interrogators warned him : `` This is the biggest citadel in the Middle East for extracting information . \nYou are 35 meters below the ground in a place that nobody except the Minister of Interior knows about . '' \nHis account is consistent with the findings of a UN Human Rights Council mission to Egypt in 2010 that found : `` There is an alarming lack of judicial oversight of facilities run by SSI , which as such are not subject to any inspections of the kind referred to above . \nWith this in mind it becomes difficult to fully ignore many reports about terrorist suspects being arrested , transferred to , and held incommunicado in what are mainly referred to as SSI secret underground cells . '' \nIn February 2010 , the Egyptian Foreign Ministry responded to accusations by HRW : `` There is no truth to the allegations regarding the unlawful detention of some individuals inside State Security Intelligence headquarters . \nIn Egyptian law no citizen can be unlawfully detained . '' \nHRW says the Egyptian government maintains that incidents of torture are isolated -- and the Ministry of Interior tends to respond to accusations of torture `` by denying the facts , discrediting the complainant , and pointing to training programs and internal disciplinary measures . '' \nIt says there is significant gap between the number of torture incidents that victims or their families document or file with prosecutors , and the very small number of complaints that prosecutors transfer to court and result in convictions . \nThe HRW report says the offices of the Public Prosecutor in Egypt `` operates very much as an instrument of the executive '' , despite its formal independence as a judicial body . \n`` Another factor contributing to impunity is the clear conflict of interest that arises when police are involved in investigating allegations of abuse within their own ranks , '' it says . \nIn its recommendations , Human Rights Watch urges the Egyptian government to take steps towards ending torture and ensuring effective investigations . \n`` Officials at the highest levels , including the president and minister of interior , should publicly acknowledge the scope of torture in Egypt and declare that they will tolerate neither torture nor ill-treatment . '' \nAnd it adds : `` The ministry of interior should immediately end the illegal practice of enforced disappearance and detention in SSI offices , and allow prosecutors to conduct unannounced visits to such sites to verify compliance .

'' \nBut Issac also said his party opposed the announced goal of some demonstrators , who planned to march from Tahrir Square to the Presidential Palace . \n`` I send a message for all the demonstrators . \nDo n't leave the square , '' Issac said , in a telephone interview with CNN . \nA march of tens of thousands of people , if not more , would put the protesters in tense confrontations with the Egyptian troops who have established checkpoints throughout the city . \nAt the outskirts of Tahrir Square , army officers drove a truck blaring patriotic music from loudspeakers . \nOn Monday , the military announced it would not use force against the demonstrators . \n`` The presence of the armed forces in the Egyptian streets is for your benefit to protect your safety and peace , '' an unnamed military spokesman announced on state television Monday night . \n`` Your armed forces will not use violence against this great people , who have always played a significant role in every moment of Egypt 's great history .

\nIVAN WATSON , CNN CORRESPONDENT : That 's right . \nWe saw Muslims and Christians holding hands together upfront at the stage and hold side by side , Randi , a cross and a copy of the Quran in a show of brotherhood here . \nWe 've also just had some evangelical Egyptian Christians playing music on the stage . \nAnd that was moments after hundreds of Muslim Christians prayed on the asphalt . \nAnd that 's a big deal in a country where just about a month - a little bit more than a month ago , there were some bloody tensions between Muslims and Christians erupting in different parts of the country . \nNow , we 've heard that one of the main opposition parties , Randi , the Muslim Brotherhood , has said it is willing to sit down now and engaged in a dialogue with the new vice president , Omar Suleiman . \nMeanwhile , the demonstrations continue here , and there 's a new twist that 's emerged since yesterday : All night last night , some of the demonstrators , scores of them , sat outside the barricades that really protect this enclave here in the heart of Cairo - they sat with campfires making a human chair to prevent the Egyptian military from being able to come in . \nWe saw a standoff earlier yesterday where two tanks were approaching . \nThey are putting their lives on the line , and they do not trust the Egyptian military to come in in large numbers . \nThey say they do not want them to push this demonstration out of Tahrir Square . \nTake a listen to what one man had to say to us . \nWATSON : And you can see there , people sitting around - and they 're still doing that now - around an armored personnel carrier . \nThey do not want it to be able to move . \nWhy some of the distrust ? \nWell , one argument might be that the Egyptian military police is one of the secret police - plainclothes police organizations that has been involved in a number of the tensions of journalists and aid workers and human-right workers around Cairo in recent days . \nI 've talked to at least four or five people who say they have been detained by the military police . \nSome of these people saying they 've been blindfolded and handcuffed , taken in for hours of interrogation . \nAnd that 's despite the fact that a spokesman for the interior minister recently claimed in a press conference that the military will remain neutral in this standoff between Hosni Mubarak and the demonstrators here in Tahrir Square - Randi . \nKAYE : All right . \nOur Ivan Watson for us there in Cairo . \nAnd I 'll tell you , take a look at those crowds , and you 'd think after - what ? \n- Day 13 now , the protesters might be feeling a little bit defeated . \nBut you just look at those crowds , and it seems as though more and more protesters are making their way today to Liberation Square . \nIvan , we 'll check back with you later on . \nBefore Egypt erupted , the anti-government protests brought change in Tunisia . \nBut new demonstrations there have now turned deadly . \nTwo people were killed and more than a dozen others were injured when police fired shots into the crowd . \nProtesters threw rocks and Molotov cocktails at a police station in the northern city of El Kef . \nTunisia 's president fled after protests last month . \nIt 's not clear exactly what sparked these new demonstrations . \nIraq 's prime minister is n't wasting any time announcing his political intentions . \nNouri al-Maliki now says he wo n't run for a third term as Iraq 's leader . \nHe has another three years left in his current term , Al-Maliki also says he 'll back a term-limit amendment to Iraq 's constitution . \nTime for our `` Weekend Wheel , '' a look at other news you need to know as you get started this Sunday morning . \nCheck out this police stop of a suspected drunk driver in Frankfort , Kentucky . \nThis is from a gas-station surveillance video . \nThat 's Office Brian Redman -LRB- ph -RRB- there in his car . \nYou can see him trying to get the driver to stop . \nBut that 's not exactly happening . \nThe officer was injured . \nThe driver was later found arrested - and he was arrested later on and has a court appearance tomorrow . \nThe officer is recovering at home . \nSome restaurants in Southern California are being warned that their ground beef could make customers sick . \nThe beef shipped to those restaurants by one California company may be contaminated with E. coli bacteria . \nWe 're talking about 3,000 pounds of hamburger patties and other products . \nWe have n't heard of any reports of people getting sick from that bad beef . \nTwo American hikers are on trial today in Iran for spying and trespassing . \nShane Bauer , Josh Fattal and Sarah Shourd were detained in the summer of 2009 after they allegedly strayed across an unmarked border from Iraq into Iran . \nShourd was released last fall because of a medical condition . \nShe did not return for the trial . \nWell , as if I really need to remind you that the Super Bowl is today . \nThe Green Bay Packers and Pittsburgh Steelers will battle it out in Arlington , Texas . \nFor your planning purposes , kickoff is at 6:29 p.m. Eastern time . \nMore than 90 million people are expected to tune in . \nBut many are n't really watching the game ; they want to see the commercials , and of course the halftime show . \nThis year , is the Black Eyed Peas . \nI. AM , BLACK EYED PEAS : We were inspired by the Olympics in China , where everyone came together as - as one . \nAnd I do n't want to give too much , but it 's - it 's to that level . \nLast year 's Super Bowl actually set a record with more than 106 million people watching . \nFormer Vice President Dick Cheney is remembering the legacy of former President Ronald Reagan . \nToday would have been the Great Communicator 100th birthday . \nDICK CHENEY -LRB- R -RRB- , FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA : When all of us think back to Ronald Reagan and try to sum up all that he was and all that he accomplished , ` thank you ' is still a pretty good place to start . \nWe associate idealism with youth . \nBut the oldest man ever elected president was also the most idealistic . \nAnd he brought out that quality in the American people . \nHe inspired the kind of affection that even great men can not claim by right , but goes only to the truly good . \nKAYE : California Governor Jerry Brown has declared today Ronald Reagan Centennial Day . \nIf you wanted to preorder the iPhone 4 from Verizon , well , forget about it . \nVerizon sold out of its preorder iPhones in less than a single day . \nIt had expected to take preorders right up to Thursday 's launch date , when the iPhones will be in stores . \nVerizon says there will be one more presale starting - mark your calendars - at 3:01 a.m. - 3:01 a.m. Eastern - on Wednesday morning . \nSo set your alarms . \nIt seems like Lindsay Lohan just can not keep herself out of trouble . \nThe Los Angeles district attorney is considering felony charges against the actress for the alleged theft of a $ 2,500 necklace from a Venice , California , jewelry store . \nLohan 's lawyers says his client did not do anything wrong . \nThe 24-year-old actress is already on probation in a drunk-driving case . \nIt is a good thing the Super Bowl will be played under a dome because the weather in Dallas has been downright dreadful . \nWill it finally warm up for the fans to come out and play ? \nPlus , how long will Christina Aguilera hold that last note when she sings the national anthem at Saturday 's Super Bowl . \nMillions of dollars could be riding on it . \nGot snow , like they did earlier this week in Dallas ? \nWell , what do you do ? \nYou build an igloo . \nThat ' exactly what Jon Kettles did . \nHe credits his Canadian family for teaching him the fine art of melting and refreezing snow to build this . \nHow cute is that ? \nOne hundred snow block sin all went into constructing it . \nHis son and daughter selling hot chocolate for a buck . \nThat 's a very unique hot - chocolate stand . \nThe igloo chimney and all is the hit of the neighborhood , as you can imagine . \nKAYE : Are you willing to take a gamble this weekend ? \nExperts figure about $ 10 billion will be bet on Sunday 's Super Bowl . \nAnd half those wagers will have absolutely nothing to do with point spreads or even football . \nThey 'll be propositions bets . \nFor example , you can place a wager on how many times the Fox announcers will mention former Packer Brett Favre 's name . \nThe over - under there is two-and-a-half . \nOr , who will the Super Bowl MVP thank first after the game ? \nHis coach , 10-to-1 odds . \nHis family , 4-to-1 odds . \nHe 's actually a 3-to-2 favorite . \nYou can even bet on how long it will take for Christina Aguilera to sing the national anthem . \nThe over-under is one minute , 54 seconds . \nOr maybe even how long she 'll hold that final note . \nThe over-under there is six seconds , a bet comedian Jimmy Kimmel may be planning to place . \nJIMMY KIMMEL , COMEDIAN : I am going with the under . \nI 'm going under six seconds . \nI think she 's going to do it under ... KIMMEL : Almost every person I talk to thinks she 'll go longer to show off because it 's the Super Bowl . \nBut I say , no , I do n't think Christina Aguilera is a showoff . \nDo you hear that Christina ? \nI do n't think you 're a showoff . \nAnd only a showoff would sing the word `` brave '' for more than six seconds . \n-LRB- END VIDEO CLIP -RRB- KAYE : Seems like he 's up to no-good there . \nSo that 's how the Super Bowl can actually change your personal finances . \nBut what about the overall impact of the big game ? \nThe numbers are actually staggering . \nCNN 's Jason Carroll takes a look . \nJASON CARROLL , CNN CORRESPONDENT : You ca n't talk about football without throwing in a few interesting stats . \nHere 's the bottom line : More and more out there are watching . \nThis past season was a runaway hit . \nEach game had almost 18 million people watching . \nAnd if you just look at Super Bowl viewing , the audience has quadrupled since the mid-1960s . \nLast year , over 160 - 106 million people watched , making it the most-viewed TV event in history . \nAll that popularity coming at a high cost . \nThis year 's Super Bowl ads run $ 3 million for a 30-second spot . \nWell , apparently , it 's worth it . \nAdvertisers know they can reach out not only to a large number of men , but women , too , who are now watching in higher numbers . \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : It 's a social thing , and you want to be involved in a social thing . \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : Because of very attractive football players like Miles Austin . \nYou know , it 's a Sunday thing . \nIt 's definitely like an American sport . \nCARROLL : So what 's behind all the football fever ? \nIt goes beyond the Bowl . \nTake a listen to one expert . \nMARK WALLER , NFL 'S CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER : There 's now in - in this country and around the world so little that people can huddle around and - and are kind of word is , it 's America 's last campfire . \nLINDA KAPLAN THALER , MARKETING EXPERT : This is an event that everybody is part of , and you 're not - you 're not going to watch a - you know , you 're not going to DVR it . \nThat 's - you know , it 's going to - it 's very , very immediate . \nCARROLL : Well , some companies do n't even need to buy a Super Bowl ad in order to cash in on the day . \nSunday is traditionally one of the busiest pizza-buying days of the year , along with the day before Thanksgiving and New Year 's Day . \nRetailers also looking for a Super Bowl bounce in flat-screen TV sales in anticipation for the big day . \nKAYE : Jason mentioned that last year 's Super Bowl broke the record for most-watched TV show in history . \nSo what show held the old record ? \nThe answer coming your way in just 90 seconds . \nKAYE : Before the break , we asked you what show was knocked off the most-watched list by last year 's Super Bowl . \nWell , the answer is `` M \\* A \\* S \\* H.

Bush the troops he need for the 1991 Persian Gulf War . \nMubarak 's cooperation with the U.S. in taking on terrorists , including al-Qaeda , has often made Egypt a target of their rage . \nIn 1997 , radicals killed dozens of tourists in Luxor and struck again in 2005 in the resort enclave of Sharm El Sheikh , slaughtering 88 people . \nMubarak has tried to moderate Hamas and keep radical Islamic groups at bay , ruling with an iron fist . \nHis cooperation with President George W. Bush 's war on terror became even more crucial after the September 11 attacks . \nOil also plays a critical role . \nWhile Egypt is neither a major oil producer nor a consumer , the Suez Canal , which cuts through the country , is a vital waterway that keeps oil from the Arab region flowing to the west . \nKAYE : At a meeting of security officials in Munich , Germany , yesterday , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton backed the transition to a new government . \nShe said the region - quote - `` is being battered by a perfect storm of powerful trends . \nLeaders can hold back the tide for a little while , but not for long , '' she said . \nFor troops deployed overseas , today is one of the most anticipated days of the years : Super Bowl Sunday . \nOver 100,000 pounds of chicken wings and thousands of pizzas on the way to Iraq and Afghanistan for the big game . \nWe 're going to take you there live next . \nKAYE : Welcome back , everyone . \nI ' Randi Kaye . \nIt 's half past the hour . \nIn Egypt today , the man put in charge of the government 's transition is meeting again with opposition leaders . \nVice President Omar Suleiman is talking with leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood . \nThe Muslim Brotherhood is one of the highest profile opposition groups . \nThey had originally said they would not negotiate until president Mubarak resigned . \nBut the group 's spokesman now tells CNN that they have decided to take the people 's demands to the negotiating table . \nAs millions protest in Egypt and around the world , one very key element is missing , solidarity . \nThe fragmented opposition agrees on one thing , Mubarak must go , but there is no clear leader is pulling them together . \nCNN 's Fred Pleitgen takes a look at what might happen if Mubarak does step down . \nFRED PLEITGEN , CNN CORRESPONDENT -LRB- voice over -RRB- : Roaring speeches and cheering crowds . \nChange is in the air in Cairo 's Tahrir Square . \nAbu Elezz Harari is a leftist politician with a large following , but says he 's not willing to step up and lead anti-government protesters . \nABU ELEZZ HARARI , EGYPTIAN OPPOSITION POLITICIAN -LRB- through translator -RRB- : We have not chosen a leader yet . \nThere is a group that represents the people that can lead in the transitional period , and then the people will choose a president and a government . \nPLEITGEN : Former IAEA Chief Mohamed ElBaradei is part of the group , and so is Amir Mousa , the head of the Arab League . \nBut many of those who have battling on the front lines for over a week do n't want anyone representing them . \nThis belongs on our shoulders . \nIt 's grown up on our shoulders . \nIt belongs to the people , the youngest people . \nThis is our revolution , not belong to them . \nUnderstand me or no ? \nPLEITGEN -LRB- on camera -RRB- : Yes , but what about Mohamed ElBaradei , Amir Mousa ? \nWe want Mubarak to move out . \nPLEITGEN : The protesters here have sacrificed a lot and they 've achieved a lot . \nHowever , Hosni Mubarak still remains in power and the opposition has yet to offer an alternative . \n-LRB- Voice over -RRB- : The conservative Islamic Muslim Brotherhood is the largest opposition movement in Egypt . \nBut although their members are taking a leading role in the protests , they say they will not put up a presidential candidate . \nMOHAMMED BELTAGY , MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD : Our society activities , but no presidential candidate . \nPLEITGEN -LRB- voice over -RRB- : Several leaders of the established opposition parties have been negotiating with Omar Suleiman , the newly appointed Egyptian vice president . \nOne of those who took part says the talks are in a stalemate . \nMUNIR FAKHRI , WAFD PARTY LEADER : As long as the protesters are not ready to lower the level of their demands , very bluntly , their demands is that President Mubarak leaves , quits . \nAnd as long as the regime refuses to take steps towards meeting at least part of those demands , I think it 's very difficult to reach a compromise . \nPLEITGEN : Without a leading figure in the anti-government movement , many fear Egypt could remain in a state of paralysis for months . \nProtesters entrenched in Tahrir Square , Hosni Mubarak clinging to power , and a nation on the brink of chaos . \nFred Pleitgen , CNN , Cairo , Egypt . \n-LRB- END VIDEOTAPE -RRB- KAYE : Checking top stories for you now . \nFormer Vice President Dick Cheney is calling embattled Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak a , quote , `` good friend and ally , '' but he is not predicting whether Mubarak will step down . \nCheney says despite pundits and politicians , Egyptians will decide their own fate . \nDICK CHENEY , FMR . \nVICE PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES : I think it is important for us all to remember that this issue will be resolved by the Egyptians . \nYou know , there 's a lot of people with opinions outside of the government . \nCommentators on the cable news shows , but bottom line in the end , whatever comes next in Egypt will be determined by the people of Egypt . \nAnd we need to remember that . \nKAYE : Cheney spoke last night at a ceremony honoring former President Ronald Reagan . \nThe Gipper would have turned 100 today . \nA concert was held last night at the Reagan Presidential Library and Museum in Simi Valley , California . \nCalifornia 's governor has declared today Ronald Reagan Centennial Day . \nSome restaurants in Southern California are being warned their ground beef could make customers sick . \nThe beef shipped to those restaurants by a California company may be contaminated by e. Coli . \nWe 're talking about 3,000 pounds of hamburger patties and other products . \nIt 's not clear if anyone has been sickened by the recalled products . \nIt 's Super Bowl Sunday . \nWhat 's a Super Bowl without pizza and wings , right ? \nAmerican service members in Iraq , Afghanistan , Philippines and Korea are getting pizza and chicken wings with their Super Bowl . \nThe non-profit group , Pizzas For Patriots worked with the delivery service DHL and Uno 's Chicago Grill to ship nearly 35,000 pizzas overseas , along with more than 245,000 pounds of wings , hot , spicy , mild , you name it . \nIt is all there for the troops . \nHalfway across the world , Super Bowl fever is very much alive in Afghanistan . \nWe 've asked Commander Keith Steussi from the U.S. Navy and Captain Sara Armstrong from the U.S. Army to join us from Camp Leatherneck , which is in Helmand Province in Afghanistan . \nGreat to see both of you . \nWe are so glad you are joining us this morning . \nI know you both have your picks on the game today and a favorite team . \nSo , Commander , let 's start with you . \nWho would you like to see win the big one ? \nCMDR. KEITH STEUSSI , U.S. NAVY , AFGHANISTAN : Well , I think this hat says it all . \nI -- I 'm a huge Packer fan . \nGrew up in Wisconsin . \nAnd we were talking before you came on that I 'm predicting the Packers are going to win 24-23 on a last-minute drive by Aaron Rodgers , maybe you know , 10 , 15 seconds left . \nThat 's how it will end up . \nKAYE : And Captain Armstrong , I believe have you a different view how this is going to turn out ? \nCAPT. SARAH ARMSTRONG , U.S. ARMY , AFGHANISTAN : I do have a very different view . \nI see the Steelers winning their -- the Super Bowl . \nIt 's going to be close I think , but I definitely think the Steelers have it in them to win this one . \nKAYE : I think the game is on in the middle of the night for both of you . \nSo , Commander , what is your plan to watch the game ? \nAnything set up for you ? \nSTEUSSI : Yeah , well , we -- I run a clinic over here , and we have a pretty large sized TV in our conference room , so I 've got about 10 to 15 friends who will be coming over and we 'll watch the game there . \nSo it should be a lot of fun . \nKAYE : And , Captain , what 's it like . \nHelp us to understand what it 's like to watch your favorite team play halfway across the world , while serving your country ? \nIt 's a great experience , and it really brings me close to home because I get to experience something with my family back in western Pennsylvania and really cheer for the home team . \nKAYE : I do n't see your Steelers hat with you . \nDo you have one ? \nKAYE : One advantage of being overseas and serving your country is all the food certainly that you get delivered to you on big game , on Super Bowl day . \nWhat do you get ? \n4,800 pounds of mozzarella cheese sticks , we understand , are going to Afghanistan alone ; 4,000 pounds of jalapeno poppers , 4,800 pepperoni pizzas , 3,600 pizza and supreme pizzas . \nWhat do you plan to eat ? \nI 'm sure you 'll have more than chips and dip today ? \nSTEUSSI : I think we can go to the dining facility , and maybe we 'll have to bring some home . \nAs you may know the timing , as you mentioned , is a little off here . \nWe 're going to-the game starts at 3:30 in the morning . \nSo we 'll probably have a dinner and then have a second dinner when the game comes on for sure . \nKAYE : I understand , Commander , you actually have some big plans , if the Packers do win , what 's your plan for a celebration ? \nSTEUSSI : Well , you know , my celebration actually , it 's pretty big , I 'm going to take a half day off of work I think . \nI 'm going to just sleep in and celebrate probably . \nBut we -- we have a little running bet in my clinic with another physical therapist , Commander Shane Vath -LRB- ph -RRB- , he 's a big Pittsburgh fan . \nWe 've each got little side bets I ca n't disclose on TV . \nBut if we-whichever team wins , we 'll have to do that tomorrow afternoon , probably , so -- KAYE : I know we 're here to talk about the Super Bowl . \nBut , Captain , I want to give you a chance to say anything you 'd like to your family this morning . \nIt will be great to see everybody when I get back . \nKAYE : And , commander , would you like to say hello as well ? \nSTEUSSI : Yeah , my parents live in Florida . \nI think they are watching this . \nHi , mom and dad . \nMy wife is in San Diego . \nSay hi to them , and my kids , and I have two brothers who are also probably watching . \nHi , to everyone . \nAnd just like captain said , we 'll be coming home relatively soon . \nAnd go Pack , that 's all I can say . \nKAYE : I knew she was going to follow with that one . \nWe want to thank both of you . \nCaptain Sara Armstrong , Commander Keith Steussi , I want to thank you both for , not only for joining us but for serving your country . \nSTEUSSI : Thank you very much . \nKAYE : How nice . \nWhat a celebration they will have over there . \nWhen it rains it pours , or so the saying goes , but what about when it snows a whole lot . \nWe are taking a look at the best videos to come out of this week 's storm . \nYou are definitely going to want to stick around and see the rest after that giant snowman . \nThat is coming your way next . \nKAYE : Welcome back . \nThunder snow , sliding dogs , and a fire - breathing snow creature , oh , my . \nCNN 's Jeanne Moos on the crazy winter weather . \nJEANNE MOOS , CNN CORRESPONDENT -LRB- voice over -RRB- : Having to abandon your car on Lake Shore Drive in Chicago is bad , but not as bad as having your car 's nose rubbed in the snow . \nThere were accidents like this one in Salem , New Hampshire and roof collapses . \nBut as some things went down , others went up and up and up . \nThis 35-foot snowman in Champion , New York , has a snow cone for a nose and a swimming pool for a top hat . \nIt 's enough to give Frosty button envy . \nThese buttons made out of racing tires . \niReporters have sent in Packers and Steelers helmets in Wisconsin , a snow squirrel in New Jersey , a giraffe in Staten Island , and our personal favorite -- Nick and Anna Berte -LRB- ph -RRB- of Bel Air , Maryland , call their creation -- MOOS : Godzilla out of snow . \nThe fiery breath is supplied by a flame thrower made out of carburetor cleaner and a butane lighter . \nIt does n't melt the snow that much . \nMOOS : Now if there is a buzzword coming out of this latest mega storm it 's -- DAVID LETTERMAN , LATE NIGHT WITH DAVID LETTERMAN : Thunder snow ! \nIt 's -- it 's God 's first new work in 500 years . \nIt 's thunder snow ! \nMOOS : Thunder during snow , is a weatherman 's snow fantasy . \nSon of a -- MOOS : Weathermen get dumped on by comedians during snowstorms . \nMOOS : CNN 's own Ed Lavandera got the Jimmy Kimmel treatment . \nED LAVANDERA , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Sorry . \nYou have to be careful as these cars drive by I want to make sure they do n't lose control or anything like that . \nMOOS : From sliding dogs , to a joker who thought it would be funny to go shirtless in Chicago . \nHow you view the snow can help you weather it . \nIt 's kind of a fun challenge , do n't you think ? \nREGIS PHILBIN , REGIS & KELLY : I love those glasses . \nKELLY RIPA , REGIS & KELLY : She has four inches of snow on her glasses alone . \nMOOS : And a 100 percent chance of near zero visibility . \nWould n't it be great if some dusty old vase lying around the house turned out to be worth more than a million bucks , say ? \nThat 's the story for one lucky man in England . \nWe 'll go there in our `` Morning Passport '' . \nKAYE : It is going to be a big week in Washington , with President Obama and the Tea Party making some major moves . \nCNN Deputy Political Director Paul Steinhauser has the rundown . \nPAUL STEINHAUSER , CNN DEPUTY POLITICAL DIRECTOR : Good morning , Randi . \nPresident Barack Obama heads into what some consider politically enemy territory tomorrow , when he speaks in front of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce . \nLast year the Chamber opposed Mr. Obama 's push for Wall Street and healthcare reform . \nAnd in the mid term elections , worked to defeat many Democrats who had backed the president 's programs . \nOn Tuesday , here in Washington , what 's being touted as the first - ever Tea Party town hall . \nAmong the lawmakers attending the event , Senator Rand Paul and Congresswoman Michele Bachmann . \nOn Thursday , the annual Conservative Political Action conference kicks off . \nThere is controversy this year , with some social conservative groups boycotting to protest the inclusion of a pro-gay Republican group . \nSpeaking at the event , many of the Republicans who may -- may -- run for the White House . \nThe conference ends Saturday with the straw poll for the GOP presidential nomination , Randi . \nKAYE : An arrow straight through the heart of ancient Japanese tradition . \nSome of Japan 's most respected sumo wrestlers admit-get this-that they have been cheating . \nPlus , a shout out to reggae 's biggest icon ; Bob Marley would have been 66 today . \nWe 're taking you to Japan and Jamaica , all in our `` Morning Passport '' . \nKAYE : 2,000 years of Japanese culture and tradition , undermined by modern-day cheats . \nSumo wrestling in Japan dates back 2,000 years . \nIt 's the country 's national sport . \nBut it 's honor and image has now been tarnished . \nJust this week , by allegations of match rigging . \nSay it is n't so . \nNadia Bilchik joining me to talk about all of that . \nNADIA BILCHIK , EDITORIAL PRODUCER : Exactly . \nIt 's so bad , in fact , that the match rigging may result in them canceling the season . \nBILCHIK : Now , the season has not been canceled since 1946 , post World War II , when they had to cancel to repair the stadium . \nWe are looking at sumo wrestlers , and as you said , dates back 2,000 years . \nKAYE : This is a little tough in the morning for me to watch . \nWe 'll go with it . \nBILCHIK : Shinto is the native religion of Japan . \nAnd it means Way of the Gods , but there is much more to sumo than just large men eating each other up . \nIn fact , what is really incredible is it is about entertaining the gods . \nAnd the pre-bout traditions are what makes it sumo so fascinating . \nThey do all kinds of things like throw salt into the stadium as a way of purification . \nSo there is so much more to sumo than just fighting . \nKAYE : Do we know how they even figured this out ? \nBILCHIK : Well , what they did was they confiscated the phones of 13 sumo wrestlers and they found - BILCHIK : Now , do you want to know how sumo wrestlers get so large ? \nThey have 20,000 calories a day and 85 percent body fat . \nSo , if you want to know how to get fat , go on the sumo diet . \nKAYE : I do n't think I need to go on the sumo diet . \nThat does n't sound like a good thing . \nBut they were texting each other to what ? \nYou go down and I 'll get - BILCHIK : Yes , they were rigging it . \nIt would be like rigging the Super Bowl . \nI mean , this is part of national pride . \nThe prime minister has weighed in , saying you are betraying the Japanese people . \nKAYE : I just want to talk about an icon 's birthday today , before we run out of time . \nBILCHIK : Before we get to the icon 's birthday , can I tell you about a Ming vase ? \nBILCHIK : If you do n't mind ? \nBecause in London this week , a gentleman walks in , a 79-year-old retired worker walks into an auction house with a box . \nIn the box there is a vase . \nNow take a look at that vase . \nWe 're looking at it . \nIf you notice , the handles are of an Islamic design . \nSo , it is a Chinese Ming vase with exceptional handles , that makes is so precious , that it is worth 1 million pounds , about $ 1.6 million . \nKAYE : Would have been 66 ? \nBILCHIK : Is n't that incredible ? \nWould have been 66 today ; the year of the Rooster , he was born in 1945 and he died in his 30s . \nThere he is , the icon , the person who popularized reggae music and the Rastafarian movement . \nWhat would our lives have been like without , `` No Woman , No Cry '' , `` One Love '' and `` Buffalo Soldier '' ? \nSo , personally , thank you , Bob . \nKAYE : `` Buffalo Soldier '' , big fan . \nBILCHIK : We honor you . \nThis is Reggae Month in Jamaica , man . \nKAYE : Nicely done . \nThank you , Nadia . \nKAYE : Thousands of T-shirts , hats and sweatshirts have been made proclaiming both the Packers and Steelers the Super Bowl champs , just in case . \nOnce a team wins the merchandise will be rolled out to the masses . \nBut did you ever wonder what happens to the shirts for the losing teams ? \nKAYE : Welcome back everyone . \nWe are getting close to the top of the hour . \nWhichever team loses today 's Super Bowl , plenty of poverty - stricken children will be very grateful . \nCNN 's Mark McKay explains . \nMARK MCKAY , CNN SPORTS CORRESPONDENT Almost like magic in the moments after a new Super Bowl champion is crowned , the players on the winning team are sporting hats and T-shirts . \nThere is no magic involved . \nAll of that merchandise is preprinted . \nWhat happens to the apparel on the team that did n't win ? \nThe NFL donates it to the aid organization , World Vision . \nBoth championship games and the Super Bowl , we get about 300 shirts and 300 hats . \nBut then from the pre-buys , each year , we get more and more of the pre-buy product from the retailers , and that has really helped a lot . \nOur stipulation with the league is it has to go out of the country . \nWe ca n't keep it in the U.S. or Canada , and from there , they leave it up to us to determine where the most need is . \nThis year , we know there is good needs in Zambia , Romania , Armenia , and Nicaragua . \nThose are poor countries we 're keying in on now . \nBasically , just strictly on need . \nIf we do get some sweatshirts in , which I 'm sure we will , because all four teams are cold weather teams , we 'll look to the cold weather countries we are serving like Mongolia or Armenia . \nWe 're working in areas where there is generally no electric , unfortunately , a lot of times no running water . \nThey have in idea who the Chicago Bears , New York Jets , Pittsburgh Steelers , Green Bay Packers , any of the teams are . \nThey are just glad they are getting a brand new shirt that is in great shape . \nA lot of them never received something new like that in their lives . \nIt 's really life changing . \nMCKAY : So , now you know . \nBy the way , World Vision 's international distribution center is located in Pittsburgh . \nI wonder which team 's apparel they would rather be shipping out next week . \nMark McKay , CNN , Arlington , Texas . \nA quiet morning so far in Tahrir Square as hundreds gather for Muslim prayers and protestors now dig in for day 13 . \nIn Iran , the trial of three U.S. hikers now underway , all accused of spying and trespassing . \nAnd paying tribute to Ronald Reagan . \nHe would have been 100 years old today . \nEvents across the country will honor his life and legacy . \nAnd later today , John King hosts special coverage of the centennial celebration starting at 2:00 p.m. here on CNN . \nIt is early and we 're on it . \nFrom CNN Center , this is CNN SUNDAY MORNING . \nIt 's February 6th . \nGlad you 're with us . \nI 'm Randi Kaye . \nIt is 7:00 a.m. now on the East Coast ; 2:00 p.m. in Egypt . \nThousands of people filling Cairo 's Liberation Square again today , and it looks like there 's some movement between the embattled government of Hosni Mubarak and one element of protesters . \nLeaders of the Muslim Brotherhood group have just wrapped up a meeting with Vice President Omar Suleiman . \nBrotherhood members originally said they would n't talk until President Mubarak was out of office . \nThere 's also been some high-level shuffling in Egypt 's ruling political party . \nSeveral leaders handed in their resignations , including one of President Mubarak 's sons . \nCNN 's Frederik Pleitgen is in Cairo and joins us by phone . \nGood morning , Fred . \nCan you describe the scene there for us ? \nFREDERIK PLEITGEN , CNN CORRESPONDENT -LRB- via telephone -RRB- : Well , it is a very peaceful one , Randi , certainly much more so than the past couple of days . \nAs you said , I would say , right now , it 's 4,000 to 5,000 people who are in Tahrir Square . \nAnd we are hearing that there 's also some Christian masses that are due to be held there today to commemorate those , of course , who were killed in the protests that have gone on . \nOf course , well over 100 people who are killed in that . \nOtherwise , what I 'm seeing , an Egyptian capital that tries to get back on its feet . \nThere 's more traffic in the streets . \nI was sort of driving around town today and it seems as though more and more shop owners are trying to open their stores . \nThe banks are open for the first time since the cries began . \nI saw some very long lines in front of ATM machines and inside banking centers . \nBut it does n't seem to be the kind of panic that many had feared here . \nI saw -- a lot of people we were talking to who were saying , yes , they are withdrawing a lot of money right now , but the main reason for that is that they could n't withdraw any money over the past couple of days . \nSo , they certainly have some catching up to do . \nSo , at this point in time , it seems as though the Egyptian capital is sort of trying to get back on its feet . \nOf course , it 's still very much scarred by the past couple of days and , of course , this protest still is really going strong , we have to say , for the numbers I can see there on Tahrir Square right now , Randi . \nKAYE : And , Fred , is there anything that you can tell us anymore about the meetings with the opposition and the government ? \nWe know that the Muslim Brotherhood has apparently just wrapped up a meeting with the vice president . \nThe Muslim Brotherhood has wrapped up a meeting . \nAnd that , of course , as you said , is significant , because beforehand , the Muslim Brotherhood had said it would not talk to the government unless Hosni Mubarak resigned immediately . \nSo , it seems as they have softened their stance . \nI 'm not exactly sure what came out of that meeting . \nAlso , apparent representatives of the people actually on Tahrir Square , known as the Movement of January 25th , they also are going to meet with the government today . \nNow , I do have some inside information from an opposition leader who met with the government yesterday for a similar meeting . \nIt was the Waft group , which is one of the biggest opposition groups here in Egypt . \nAnd they met yesterday with Omar Suleiman and they said that the talks were quite friendly , but they also said that the government very , very much entrenched on the issue of keeping Hosni Mubarak in power . \nThey said that the government was not willing to move an inch and the government told them Hosni Mubarak would stay in power and would finish the end of his term . \nSo , there are a lot of people who do n't see those negotiations coming to very much , unless , of course , the protesters drop their demand for Mubarak to leave or the government relents at some point . \nBut it does n't look that way right now , Randi . \nKAYE : The military has really been s trying to stay neutral and trying to keep the peace . \nDo you see any presence of the military today in Liberation Square ? \nPLEITGEN : Oh , yes . \nI mean , yes , you see a lot of presence not necessarily on Liberation Square , but sort of all of the entrances to the square , probably mainly to try and keep pro-Mubarak groups away from that area so there 's no trouble . \nBut the military is massive presence not just in the Tahrir Square but throughout the city . \nI mean , it was driving through vast parts of the city and you see a tank on almost -- down almost every two intersections or an armored personnel carrier . \nAlso , when you go out of town , on the main roads , there are checkpoints there , there 's tanks stationed there . \nThe military has a massive presence , not just here in downtown Cairo , but pretty much everywhere in Cairo and also outside . \nBut they are pretty much the only law enforcement entity that 's out there . \nAlthough I did see a few traffic police officers . \nBut clearly , they would not be able to deal with any sort of violent situations that would arise . \nSo , yes -- I mean , the military , a massive presence , and you see a lot of tanks on many streets here in this country , Randi . \nKAYE : All right . \nFred Pleitgen for us in Cairo , watching it all happen this morning . \nThank you , Fred . \nLet 's take a look at the one institution that could prevent a breakdown of civil society in Egypt . \nThat 's the military , which we were just discussing with Fred . \nEgyptian generals overthrew the monarchy in 1952 basically to set up a less corrupt , more responsive government . \nAnd they 've been at the heart of Egyptian power , culture , identity , ever since . \nAll of Egypt 's presidents to date have been military men and they 've ruled with emergency powers that parliament routinely renews . \nAll Egyptian men have to serve , and the officer corps enjoys decent pay and serious prestige in a relatively impoverished country . \nLet me show you how this force actually measures up . \nChina has the most , 2.3 million troops on active duty , more than any other country by far . \nThe top five countries all have more than a million troops , not counting reserves or paramilitaries . \nEgypt is actually tenth , with just under half a million active duty fighters . \nIts force is well-equipped with modern planes and tanks . \nAnd for that , it has you and me to thank . \nLast year , Egypt got $ 1.6 billion in U.S. military and economic aid -- most of it , military aid , used to buy big-ticket weapons from U.S. defense contractors . \nOver the years , the U.S. has funded Egypt faithfully . \nGenerally , Congress gives Egypt $ 2 for every $ 3 that it gives Israel . \nThe reason for that goes back to 1979 when Egypt and Israel signed the Camp David peace accords . \nThrough it all , the U.S. and the Egyptian militaries have maintained very close military ties and that has not changed to this date . \nSo , what next for the land of the pharaohs ? \nTo talk about that , we turn to Fouad Ajami , professor of Middle Eastern studies at Johns Hopkins University . \nHe 's joining us by phone . \nProfessor , this weekend -- this week , we 've actually seen some big cracks in Egypt 's regime . \nKey members of Mubarak 's ruling party resigning their positions , including his son , also the vice president now having talks with the opposition leaders , including the Muslim Brotherhood . \nSo , how significant would you say all of this is , or is it really just for show ?

FOUAD AJAMI , MIDDLE EASTERN STUDIES , JOHNS HOPKINS UNIV. -LRB- via telephone -RRB- : Well , I think the regime has fallen . \nIf you really look at the house of Mubarak and at President Mubarak himself , he has lost the mandate of his people . \nHis moral case has fallen . \nWhen millions of people come out every day and ask you to leave , and you hold on to power , you can see the fraud of this regime and you can see the moral abdication of this regime . \nBut also on trial now is the American response to what has been going on in Cairo . \nWe have become -- we have come close to betraying the democratic aspirations of these people . \nWe sent to Cairo -- the United States sent to Cairo , an envoy , Frank Wisner , who is extremely close to Mubarak . \nWe now have seen Ambassador Wisner make a statement , remarkable in the annals of the American diplomacy , he identified totally with the despot in Cairo and basically put the word out that this man needs to be there to lead Egypt to a democratic -- through a democratic transition . \nIt 's laughable to think that Mubarak would lead anyone to a democratic transition . \nSo , here you have it . \nKAYE : President Mubarak has said this week that he would n't leave Egyptian soil even if he does resign . \nDo you think that the opposition needs to see him physically leave the country before they believe he is truly out of power ? \nAJAMI : Well , the opposition , and I think even the vast majority of Egyptian people , do n't believe that Mubarak -- do n't believe anything that President Mubarak says . \nThey 've known him for a very long time . \nThirty years is a long time . \nSome 35 million Egyptians , the bulk of the young people , have been born while President Mubarak has been in office and they know about the thievery of his family , about the looting of the country 's wealth in a very poor country , and they understand that he is playing for time . \nShould he be allowed to stay ? \nShould he stay between now and September ? \nHe may create conditions where another deeper state of emergency could be declared . \nSo , you 're right , the Egyptians need to see him out of the country . \nThere is no way about it . \nAnd also , the leading figures in the opposition are surely worried about themselves . \nIf he does n't leave in a few months , they may all be in prison . \nI think this is the great standoff between a dictator and his population with America in the middle , backing this terrible dictator . \nKAYE : All right . \nWe 'll have to leave it there . \nThank you for your insight , Professor Ajami . \nKAYE : He was called the great communicator . \nBut he was so much more than that . \nBroadcaster , actor , and the nation 's 40th president -- Ronald Reagan is being remembered today on what would have been his 100th birthday . \nWe look back at the Reagan legacy and more , next . \nKAYE : Welcome back . \nTwelve minutes past the hour . \nOne hundred years ago today , America 's great communicator was born and 40th president was born . \nRonald Wilson Reagan , the modern day icon of conservatism , is being warmly remembered this weekend at his presidential ranch and museum in California . \nOur Ted Rowlands takes us there for a tour and more . \nTED ROWLANDS , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Randi , it 's a weekend of celebration here at the Reagan Library . \nNancy Reagan will be here to cut the ribbon on a $ 15 million renovation of the museum portion of the library . \nWe had an opportunity to take a sneak peek at it . \nIt is very impressive . \nRONALD REAGAN , FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT : Mr. Gorbachev , tear down this wall . \nROWLANDS -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Video and sound are a constant feature . \nReagan 's movies and speeches played throughout . \nJOHN HEUBUSCH , EXEC . \n, REAGAN PRESIDENTIAL FOUNDATION : We have right over here to my right , the very famous debate with President Carter where he asked the question , `` Are you better off now than you were four years ago ? '' \nROWLANDS : There 's also a Berlin Wall , with tunnels and interactive videogame table and an inauguration day exhibit complete with Reagan 's speech on the teleprompter . \nHis diaries have been digitized for people to flip through . \nThere 's also an exhibit dealing with the assassination attempt on President Reagan after 70 days in office . \nAs in many presidential libraries , you can see an exact replica of the Oval Office and Air Force One , the actual plane used by seven U.S. presidents and the one Reagan flew in during his eight years in office . \nHEUBUSCH : They get to see where the president sits in the aircraft . \nThey get to see his working quarters . \nThey get to see where the Secret Service would sit , where the traveling press corps sits . \nThey get to touch and feel the airplane . \nIt 's just a great experience . \nROWLANDS : An Iran-Contra affair exhibit deals with the low point of the Reagan presidency . \nAlso on display , the letter Reagan wrote , with the audio of him reading it , announcing to the world he had Alzheimer 's . \nREAGAN : My fellow Americans , I have recently been told that I am one of the millions of Americans who will be affected with Alzheimer 's disease . \nROWLANDS -LRB- on camera -RRB- : Everything here at the library this weekend is closed to the public , but the new museum inside the library opens to the public on Monday . \nThey are expecting a lot of people . \nThey 'll be serving cake throughout the day to celebrate Ronald Reagan 's 100th birthday -- Randi . \nKAYE : Ted Rowlands from Simi Valley , California -- thank you , Ted . \nStick with CNN later this afternoon for live coverage of the festivities at the Reagan Library . \nOur John King hosts . \nIt all begins at 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time . \nIt 's a good thing the Super Bowl will be played under a dome , because the weather in Dallas has been down right dreadful . \nThe whole area is under ice and snow . \nWill it finally warm up for the fans to come out and play ? \nWe 'll let you know . \nKAYE : And welcome back . \nPeople at Cowboys Stadium today can keep their eyes on the game instead of looking up constantly to check out the roof . \nWe told you how ice and snow slid down 60 feet off the road Friday . \nSix workers getting ready for the big game were injured , but luckily , they are all OK . \nWell , it is about 16 minutes past the hour . \nHere to check in with Karen on the latest I guess there in Arlington , Texas . \nAnd I guess we 're seeing more snow and ice in that area ? \nOr have things warmed up a bit ? \nKAREN MAGINNIS , AMS METEOROLOGIST : Yes , I 'm going to show you what our latest prognostications are looking like , Randi . \nAnd this is what we anticipate over the next 24 hours . \nWhat we 're looking at so far across the panhandle , yes , you can see this snow coming a while away . \nThere is Dallas right there . \nYou can see , it looks the eastern edge of Dallas is going to be kind of a rain event . \nBut then for the west -- now , this is as about 11:00 in the evening . \nEverybody is probably still milling around the Cowboys Stadium , but just to the west , this is where we 've got the snowfall , but there 's going to be a fine line as to where the rain or the ice and snow are going to be located . \nSo , it 's going to be kind of an interesting set of events that take place over the next 12 hours or so . \nIt moves in and out fairly quickly . \nSo , that will be the good news in the forecast . \nHowever , here as we take a look at the specific forecast at game time , it looks like it 's going to start out as rainfall . \nAnd then be a rain\\/snow mix . \nTemperatures in the upper 30s , but then dropping down fairly quickly after that . \nSpeaking of , we 're watching temperatures across the northern tier states . \nNow , typically for Minneapolis , and I know , Randi , you 've worked there before . \nThey should be around 25 , 30 degrees . \nBut they 're looking at high temperatures coming up around five for a high . \nKAYE : All right , Karen . \nStressed out by the heavy snow ? \nCheck out this canopy that collapsed just before midnight last night at the Indianapolis International Airport 's parking garage . \nNobody was injured luckily , but a few rental cars sure took a beating from the falling ice and snow . \nThe area is now off limits to parking . \nThen there is this department store roof that collapsed in the greater Tulsa area last night . \nTwo employees were inside at the time when they heard the rumbling , and the ceiling of the store began to cave in . \nThey ran out just in time . \nBoy , were they lucky . \nJust in time before it collapsed . \nHe grew up as the son of Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker . \nHis life is all about religion . \nBut at one point , he wanted nothing to do with God . \nNow , Jay Bakker preaches the word punk style . \nHe explains it all in his new book `` Fall to Grace , '' and we 're going to chat with him after a quick break . \nKAYE : After getting exposed to the ugly side of religion , Jay Bakker turned his back on God . \nBut now , the prodigal son of Jim and Tammy Faye is leading a congregation of his own . \nHe is joining us live from New York to talk about his journey back to grace and his new book on our `` Faces of Faith '' this morning . \nJay , good to se you . \nGlad you 're with us this morning . \nJAY BAKKER , AUTHOR , `` FALL TO GRACE '' : Good to be here . \nKAYE : I 'm well . \nYour parents , PTL Network , Praise the Lord Network , reached 13 million homes . \nTell us what it was like for you growing up before the television cameras ? \nBAKKER : It was really surreal . \nI mean , it was all I knew . \nSo , growing up , it seemed normal . \nBut looking back , it was quite just an amazing thing to just constantly be on . \nYou know , constantly wondering , you know , how you look and what you 're doing and what 's going on . \nAnd also , also I grew up in my parents ' church . \nI mean , the school was there , everything was there . \nSo , I was like growing up in a big Christian bubble . \nAnd I know that later on , you struggled with alcohol and drugs as you got older . \nWould you say that was a direct result of what you had to deal with when you were younger with your family ? \nBAKKER : Maybe some . \nAlso , I think it was just natural rebellion , trying to fit in in high school and stuff like that . \nYou know , I mean , especially when everybody knows what 's going on with your family , it can be a little awkward . \nHaving all of your business out there . \nYou have since started your own church , called Revolution , a very unique name . \nWhat is the message of your church ? \nBAKKER : The message is inclusion . \nYou know , everyone is accepted . \nAnd just -- we 're a church for everybody . \nAnd we do n't say you have to be a Christian , you got to be this . \nWe just want to let people know that they are loved and they 're included and created in a safe space for people to come , and discuss issues that are going on in their life . \nKAYE : And it 's also what comes with that that was a little bit of controversy , because you are you a Christian minister , but in your book `` Fall to Grace , '' you talk about gay people and how you consider yourself a gay-affirming minister . \nSo , in other words , you think homosexuals have a place in the church . \nWhat was the reaction to that ? \nBAKKER : The reaction right away was as we lost all our finances . \nI had to let the staff go because we could n't raise finances . \nAll of my speaking engagements got canceled for a year . \nSo , it was quite a backlash . \nBut it 's definitely worth it because I -- that 's my conviction . \nI really believe that the LGBT community is poorly treated by the church and that we 've got to open the doors completely . \nKAYE : And really , in a way , you 're carrying on the beliefs of your mom in speaking out this way . \nBAKKER : Yes , my mom was -- you know , my mom was a gay icon , and , you know , she just loved people . \nAnd so , what I 've tried to do is take it to the next level of , you know , we do a lot for gay rights because it seems like a civil rights issue . \nSo , we 're not just wanting to be welcoming , but we 're wanting to be affirming and inclusive . \nKAYE : And when you think about grace , just leave us with why you think grace is so important . \nBAKKER : Because it accepts even the unacceptable , and it allows us to live our life and work with the things that are -- that are -- that are tough , and so , I think grace helps us to accept that we 're accepted and it will transform our lives . \nKAYE : All right . \nJay Bakker , glad you 're with us this morning . \nThanks for joining us . \nBAKKER : And thanks for having me . \nA quick check on today 's top stories , and the latest on the situation in Egypt -- that 's up next . \nFormer Vice President Dick Cheney is calling embattled Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak a , quote , `` good friend and ally , '' but he 's not predicting whether Mubarak will step down . \nCheney says despite pundits and politicians , Egyptians will decide their own fate . \nRICHARD CHENEY , FORMER U.S. VICE PRESIDENT : I think it 's important for us all to remember that this issue is going to be resolved by the Egyptians . \nA lot of people with opinions , outside other governments , commentators on cable news shows -- but bottom line is , in the end , whatever comes next in Egypt is going to be determined by the people of Egypt . \nAnd we need to remember that . \nKAYE : Two American hikers are on trial in Iran for spying and trespassing . \nShane Bauer , Josh Fattal and Sarah Shourd were detained in the summer of 2009 after they alleged strayed across an unmarked border from Iraq into Iran . \nShourd was released last fall because of a medical condition . \nShe did not return for the trial . \nSome restaurants in southern California are being warned that their ground beef could make customers sick . \nThe beef shipped to those restaurants by one California company may be contaminated with E. coli bacteria . \nWe 're talking about 3,000 pounds of hamburger patties and other products . \nWe have n't heard any reports of people getting sick from the bad beef . \nWell , as you know , it is Super Bowl Sunday . \nSo , we thought it would be a good time to talk about youth football and injuries suffered by kids and teenagers . \nIf you 're looking for ways to keep them safe , we think CNN 's chief medical correspondent , Dr. Sanjay Gupta , might have found the perfect program to help . \n"}

'' \nIn Atlanta , activists rallied at a downtown street corner . \nThey asked motorists to honk in their support and many cars blared as they sped past . \nIn New York , demonstrators met outside the U.N. building in the freezing rain for the second weekend in a row . \nThey chanted , `` Hey , hey , Ho , ho -- Mubarak must go ! '' \nand carried signs that read , `` Free Egypt , Jail Mubarak .

'' \nNow back in New York , Cooper will sit down for a lengthy interview on `` Piers Morgan Tonight '' Monday to talk about his experience . \nWhat do you want Piers Morgan to ask Anderson tomorrow ? \nLeave your questions below ... So Glad You stayed safe , , You did A wonderful Job And suffered enough , , , You Are The Best Thank You Amen , Jen . \nWe all have a point beyond which we can not go -- at that time -- at that place . \nAnderson Cooper and many , many of the journalists have done a magnificent job in bringing us to the tragic and heroic places and people with whom we share this planet . \nIt is unbelievable how the new technology opens the world to everyone -- but a picture is only a picutre -- it is the journalists who bring the pictures to life and afford us the understanding of what is occurring . \nI humbly thank each and every one of them . \nI thank them too , but I hope they will reconsider and go back to Egypt . \nThose who want to retain their grip on power and lock democracy up in a police state want to do that outside the view of cameras . \nThat is precisely why they harried Anderson Cooper out of the country . \nI realize it takes incredible courage to face that police state and demand free access to the democracy movement now being kept away from journalists in the center of Cairo , but I hope Anderson Cooper will reconsider his decision . \nIf he can not go back - and I will still respect him if he does n't - I hope he will lend his considerable visibility and prestige to working with organizations like the Committee to Protect Journalists to get his Eygption counterparts out of dungeons and I hope he will support getting the truth out of Egypt to his American viewers . \nThey are taxpayers - and it was their tax money that was used to beat him up in Cairo . \nFebruary 7 , 2011 at 7:57 am | Report abuse | AC : Were you ever scared ? \nDo you want to never go to dangerous events ever again ? \nMuslims and Christians had each others backs for prayers in the square . \nNice change from Shia and Sunni killing fellow Muslims in Iraq . \nIs that normal in Egypt , or more good result from the protesting ? \nIs that a message to the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt ? \nAnderson , you brought us some incredibly tense video . \nI truly feared for your safety . \nClearly the thugs were willing to throw punches . \nBut you know they had knives and guns . \nWhy do you think they stopped short , God forbid , of bringing any more harm to journalists if their goal was truly to silence them ? \nCould have been the Beatiin in the Head several times . \nMost likely CNN has played this out , we 're tired of hearing about it . \nAt the height of your visit to Egypt , , when you had to hide . \nWhat went through your mind ? \nDid you make a bucket list ? \nDid you make a promise to yourself to do something you have been procrastinating ? \nPiers , please tell Anderson , how much I loved the -LRB- Reports Notebook -RRB- February 6 , 2011 at 4:00 pm | Report abuse | Reply Did the government -LRB- US or Egypt -RRB- have anything to do with your departure ? \nGood question , Tawni . \nI had n't thought of that -- I hope he asks it ! \nPlease hug your Mom tonight . . \nand spend some quality time with her . . \nAs a Mother of a soldier during `` Shock and Awe '' , I know EXACTLY how she felt watching your reports . \nI thank God , both of you were brought home safe . \nIn what way will the Cairo uprising impact China , if at all ? \nI wonder how the Hong Kong , Vietnam , Indonesia , Malaysia , Philippones , Taiwan , Communist China 's press\\/TV And the people are reacting ? \nAfterall , the future economic and intellectual powerhouse are or will be in Asia . \nThere are lots of similarities , and tons of differences . \nBut no TV reportings have even mentioned one word except mentioning Tien Ghan Min Square massacre . \nMy biggest question is why the reporters were attacked by the Egyptians demonstrators when considering that reporters were doing them a favor by telling the world about their current conditions ? \n2 different `` factions '' One pro Government , One against the present Government . \ndo u think that the muslim brotherhood will ever respect isreal Does it make a difference to us ? \nWe just need to stay home and put our money in `` our '' mouthes . \nI 'm happy of your safe return and I hope that you will continue to cover the current crisis in Egypt . \nMy question is if you can elaborate on how exactly is Egypt 's current situation affecting other countries and if so , is it very damaging or something we need to keep a look out for the future ? \nAnderson : As per usual , terrific reporting in Egypt . \nGlad you 're safe and back home ! \nAfter experiencing the violence during your time in Egypt , do you regret going there to begin with ? \nOr , did it make for an even bigger experience ? \nWere you really punched in the face ? \nWhat was your most intense experience while there ? \nAnderson , You such a hard worker and I have to ask when do you ever sleep while you are on these trips ?? Your family must be so proud of you . \nWhat was the final straw for you to decide to fly back ??? Keep safe , we love your shows Anderson I am so glad u are back and safe The whole world has been concerned When a country goes against our Freedom of Free Speech we come out fighting like Wildcats I admire your Bravery Your Bravado Your Courage to bring us The Truth whatever the cost Will EGYPT TAKE AWAY THE FREEDOMS OF THEIR PEOPLE WILL IT BECOME A CONTROLLED ARAB STATE I WAS SO SCARED FOR U HOW SCARED WERE YOU I WOULD BE SO AFRAID I WOULD TRUST NO ONE EVEN THOSE CLOSEST TO ME HOW IS YOUR MOTHER I KNOW SHE IS SO HAPPY YOU ARE BACK GOD BLESS YOU ANDERSON WE ALL ARE PROUD OF YOU WARMEST REGARDS JUDY OF CHICAGO If the segment is taped and airs at a much later date , who is gonna care when it is broadcast ? \nThrough no fault of your own , you went from reporting the story to being part of the story . \nHow do you feel about that ? \nCan I be the first to say , while I completely understand why you are upset to be coming home early , we are all so incredibly happy to have our silver fox home . \nMy question for you is : as an American , what do you believe our country should do in regard to Egypt ? \nWhy did you not get to interview more significant people -- e. g , Christiane Amanpour got the VP and the President , Piers Morgan had the minister for finance -- outside of the elbaradei interview , you only had other reporters on your show . \n-LRB- Frankly I found Piers Morgan 's coverage way more interesting and educational -RRB- 2 . \nDid you purposely go for the `` people ' side of the story rather than the political one ? \nDid you lose sight of the story once your safety was compromised ? \nKeeping them honest -- why not cover the fact that the US for 30 years has endorsed Mubarak and on the heels of a few days of rioting , the US changes it 's position ? \nKeeping them honest again - in light of the fact that there are 82million people in Eygpt , is there any way to know that the protesters -LRB- a mere 100-200k or so of the population -RRB- are indeed the voice of the majority ? \n-- you seem to have a chip on your shoulder . \nSome -LRB- not all -RRB- valid questions , but you start out attacking ... AC , with all due respect , but where is the objectivity in your reporting about Egypt , ? \nyou took the rebels side and started calling Mubarak folowers as thungs . \nYou come and say let 's keep it honest . \nI am sorry for your eventful run but again the tension is high and many Egyptians see CNN reporting acting like a Jazeera which is well known for its liaison with Iran and radicals . \n-LRB- btw I am not Egyptian -RRB- . \nyou will be surprised how many egyptians still feel passionately about Mubarak . \nI did not see you going all up in arms when we were watching the Green revolution in Iran . \nAll what we heard was US should not involve and it is an internal issue ... wake up and adjust your reporting . . \nyou had a great potential and I still remember your reporting in 2005 out of Beirut during the great coverage of the Cedars revolution . . \nMany of you fans , including myself have made the comparison of your reporting in Egypt being similar to your reporting in Sarajevo . \nCan you elaborate on it - did you make the connections also , or is each reporting experience new and completely different for you ? \nThank you so much for all your hard work and effort in Egypt and other reports . \nYou are truly wonderful and amazing ! \nHow do you think the uprisings in Tunisia , Egypt and other Arab countries and countries in the Middle East will affect US relations with those countries ? \nSecretary Clinton condemned censoring in Egypt . \nHowever , she did n't mention that China blocked words like `` Cairo '' and `` Egypt . '' \nWhy do you think that is and how do you think had she mentioned it , China-US relations will affected ? \n: Thanks a great deal for providing poeple with a really breathtaking chance to read critical reviews from this site . \nIt really is very brilliant and as well , full of fun personally personally and my office co-workers to find your site nearly thrice inside a week to find out the latest secrets you might have . \nObviously , Im also usually motivated for your wonderful suggestions you serve . \nSelected 2 points about this page have been in truth the very best weve had . \nHow is it that many other journalists equipment was confiscated , and they were jailed , but you and your crew managed to escape this ? \nWhat made you decide to come back when Egypt is still in such a state ? \nOn Friday , when the army was evidently out in numbers to prevent violence , I expected you reporting from Tahrir Square , but you were in a hotel room . \nWas it still unsafe for you to be at ground zero ? \nOther reporters on other channels were reporting from Tahrir Square , so it was surprising to not see you there as well . \nDo you plan to go back to Egypt in the near future ? \nWhen did you sleep ? \ncan `` t instigate more fights so run home ? \nSo you got a poke in the nose apparentlyllll covering several thousand young protesters and ignoring the fact that there are some 82 million Egyptian who were not protesting seems a little one sided to me . \nHow come you all stayed fixated on the square and did not even try to get the working man ? \nThe protesters are still there , they are not the poor working average Egyptian . \nbelieve me the average Egyptian doesn ' have a cell phone . \ninternet etc. and they ca n't afford to sit around shooting their mouths off !! they work . \nMorgan please Ask Anderson if he personally see Mohammed El-Baradei as a betrayal to World Security ? \nDoes he belive the world should stand publicly NOW in support for president Muhammad Hosni Sayyid Mubarak for the security of this World ??? . \nQo Ekamutn Internetum internet beusnsis dproc @ iskapes bacarik hnaravorutun er boloris hamar . \nAys mi qani shabatva @ntacqum mez aynqan proffesional ev kazmakerpvac kerpov matucvec nor informacian , vor Internet beusnsis ashxarh @ darcav miangamamayn harazat vayr indz hamar ev es patrastvum em hastatvel ev sharunakel aystex . \nBolor nranq ovqer derevs tarakusum en masnakcel nor sksvox daserin te voch , es mecaguin patasxanatvutiamb ev vstahutiamb erashxavorum em , masnakceq ev dzer arjev kbacven nor drner , hnaravorutunner ev iharke amboxjovin nor giteliqner Da dzezanic shat ban chi xli , ev ardunqum inch kunennaq anhamemateli e linelu !!!

THIS IS FOR PAULETTE : HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF YOU WERE THE ONE BEING ATTACKED NOT JUST ONE DAY BUT MORE THAN ONE DAY FORCED TO GO IN HIDING DUE TO JOURNALISTS BEING ARRESTED INTERROGATED JAILED TORTURED ANDERSON MADE A DECISION THAT WAS A VERY DIFFICULT ONE I RESPECT THAT DECISION AND ADMIRE ANDERSON ALL THE MORE FOR MAKING IT This hero worshiping of journalists who tell only one side of the story and the safe side at that is why so many of them feel they are the story themselves . \nThey make the news not tell it . \nBut that 's what makes the world go round . \nFar be it from me to upset your love in >> When journalists are attacked to prevent them from showing the military abusing human rights , the journalists are the entire story . \nDo you seriously suggest CNN report on the attacks without mentioning what happened to Cooper ? \nFebruary 7 , 2011 at 7:26 am | Report abuse | Ask him how long you have to be on CNN before they let you have a video podcast . \nPiers Morgan Tonight only gets an audio version for now , as ratings improve will that justify video as well ? \nAnderson , I commend you for your exceptional reporting . \nI want to know if you see much change in the government so far . \nThe people want Mubarak to go , but he still is n't leaving . \nThe prime minister has been blaming the media for this chaos . \nHe seems to be just as bad as Mubarak . \nThese thugs that the govermnent has hired are still attacking you and other journalists . \nFrom what I saw yesterday , the general tried to get people to leave Tahrir Square . \nThis also seems to be what the government is trying to do to defuse the situation and for everything to go back to normal . \nThey claim that they are making changes , but so far I have n't seem much . \nThey outsted his son , which from what I have read the people like much more than Mubarak . \nThe people of Egypt want freedom and it seems the goverment is not doing much to allow this . \nMubarak claims there will be chaos if he leaves , but he and his goverment are the ones creating this chaos . \nHe claims if he leaves that the Muslim Brotherhood might take over and it would be very bad for the people , but from what i have read they are very peaceful and they are only speaking with the goverment about change . \nThey are not trying to lead the country . \nEven Obama said he should listen to the people , but not enough is being done . \nHe needs to go now . \nHow soon do you think Mubarak will leave ? \nwhen Piers is interviewing he will ask a question but never lets the guest finish what they are saying . \nWhat the hell is that about ?? Very Very rude and unprofessional . \nIt 's most irritating and I have n't even watched it very often . \nHope he 's replaced ... . . \nSOON !!!! I made the same comment here about his interruptions . \nIt is indeed so frustrating ! \nAt least Larry King did n't try to take over the show to bring emphasis on himself . \nHe remained objective and allowed his guest to remain the center of attention . \nAlso , some of Piers ' questions are inappropriate . \nWhile Piers Morgan filled the Larry King time-slot , he did n't replace him . \nThey 're both excellent for different reasons ; Piers Morgan will be even better 3 months from now than he is today . \nYou 'll know he 's reached a certain level of excellence when they give him a video podcast , for now it 's just audio February 7 , 2011 at 5:47 am | Report abuse | Good evening , Wanted to let Anderson know thank you for risking your own personel safety , and health not sure , if this is something that I could do . \nAlso , I hope its not ture but is he leaving CNN . \nWho cares if he 's gay or not he is a fantastic journalist I would put him right up there with Walter Cronkite ... Peter Jennings ... . \nThank you Anderson for all the wonderful reporting . \nYou may like Anderson Cooper but to even try and compare him with Walter Cronkite or Peter Jennings is a real stretch !! Whether he is gay or not is of no concern ... he is just more of an personality then a reporter\\/journalist . \nThe real journalists like Jennings and Cronkite gave you all the accurate details as much as they could and tried to ensure the information was correct ... Now the media just tries to fill its 24 hour news slot with the same video over and over again and interviews with any person who call themselves `` specialists '' who seem to know everything long after the fact !! Yes Lynn , you are right . \nThe true newmen of yesteryear are gone and that is unfortunate for us all . \nThey had real principles and they did investigative journalism with honest fact checkers . \nA station like the animal network and the people on it , would never have been accepted back in Cronkite 's day . \nIt really got bad when Bush took office and his people knew they were going to tell a lie to get us to go to war . \nSome of the stories they wanted to fool the public with would not past muster with the Cronkite 's of the world . \nSo they got rid of the honest unbiased newmen , Jennings , Rather , Brokaw , Koppel . \nThey even set Dan Rather up because they did not think he would go quietly . \nNone of the old timers would play the game that the special interest lobbies who are tight with the network owners wanted to play . \nWe have done a foolish thing by allowing a handful of people to own the majority of our media . \nAnd we have really done a foolish thing by not having FCC rules that you must be American born to own and control any media outlet in the United States of America . \nWhen you control the media , you can control knowledge and thinking . \nPut that together with the dumbing down of Americans or ones who are too lazy to research and read , then you have the robots and their followers at the animal network . \nWe claim to have freedom of the press but that is not totally true . \nExample : what do you think would happen if one of these news personalities went on air and said `` We have to pull back off the story and Mubarak is staying in power because Israel prefers it that way '' They would be fired and thrown off air faster than Rick Sanchez . \nI agreed with Charlton Heston when Michael Moore asked him why he thought crime had increased , people caalled me racist but I 'm not . \nAnother example would be the way the media started out reporting the aids epidemic , special groups wanted them to stop connecting the word `` gay '' to it and put pressure on the Center for Disease control to watch how they release their findings . \nLook at what happened to Lou Dobbs just because he was fighting against illegal aliens who broke the law and companies out sourcing jobs . \nHe lost me as a fan when he started on the Commander in Chief . \nNo matter how much you disagree with him , the Cronkite 's of years ago would never disparage our President the way he did , especially on International Television . \nThat was left to politians and others , not newsmen . \nThat 's why he is now on a network without principles . \nI do n't believe in hate or intolerance , we need to be able to hear the factual truth without fear , not opinions and personal commentaries . \nFebruary 7 , 2011 at 2:15 pm | Report abuse | When will the Colin Firth interview on Piers Morgan Tonight be rescheduled ? \nMARON There was one report that Muslims were going to protect Christians while they had a Mass in the Square . \nI would be interested if you think that the Muslims , Jews and Christians will be supportive of each other in whatever new government is developed . \nCraig , that is a good question for Anderson . \nI think they will all be supportive of each other , if they all got equal treatment . \nWhenever there is inequality , you will have problems . \nStand two children next to each other , then give one a big popsicle and a hug , and give the other a smaller popsicle without a hug , then watch the latters reaction . \nYou can use the same concept with adults or nations . \nThere must be equality and fairness for all . \nGod Bless I know I 'm off topic , but I do n't know where else to write . \nI have been tuning in for the past 10 days and yet somehow I missed the interview with Colin Firth and Jeffrey Rush . \nDid it actually run or is it still pending ? \nThe Firth interview has not been shown yet ... Mr. Morgan seems to think that all anyone is interested in is constant repeat information about Egypt . \nHe has advertised the Firth Interview now twice and then at the last minute pulls it . \nA real insult to his viewers . \nI find it hard to fathom how he thinks jerking viewers around like this ... advertising a program and then without notice changing it will get him a loyal audience . \nBut if you check further on this sight you will see how angry the people are at him for this constant bait and switch !! As news change so must scheduled line-ups . \nWhen important news stories come about you have to move things around a bit . \nFebruary 7 , 2011 at 11:19 am | Report abuse | I 'm as big a Colin Firth fan as the next ridiculous hero-worshiping American woman , but really ... such venom ! \nIt 's a friggin ' news channel . \nHonestly , the interview is n't going anywhere ... it 'll air ! \nHmmm ... lemme see ... should CNN programming revolve around unrealistic , unsatisfied romantic women who want to drool over an English actor or covering a world changing revolution about democracy as it was unfolding . \nIt 's not like Piers signs a contract in blood when he announces his lineup , for cryin ' outloud ! \nI think most rational people udnerstand it is `` SUBJECT TO CHANGE '' . \nKind of like what 's for dinner . \nHonestly , I think Colin is probably patient enough to know his interview will air as schedules and BREAKING NEWS AROUND THE WORLD allow . \nThe rest of us should , too . \nBTW , Colin - you are devastatingly handsome and I do love you , but I 'm willing to wait for you . \nFebruary 7 , 2011 at 4:57 pm | Report abuse | Just wanted to let everyone know , I am one that thinks Anderson made the right choice . \nI realize someone has to cover the news in the hot spots . \nHowever , I love Anderson 's sense of humor , and would like to see more of it . \nI think he has had enough Drama in his life and it is time for a change . \nI do not want any-one to come home in a body bag , but the world would loose a great heart if Anderson was bagged . \nAnderson has so much more to give with his words and needs to share his talent of writing with us . \n- Paul Stathakis from Montreal , Quebec -LRB- Canada -RRB- Anderson you and Wederman , not Christianne deserve an award for your coverage . \nMubarak gave an interview to the person he knew would soft peddle his dictatorship and removal . \nPlease take the stand that the female reporter in Egypt took , and do n't be a part of the media controlled groups . \nNo country or group is a true friend if they ask America to do something wrong that goes against who we claim to be and what we claim to believe in which is , freedom and democracy for all . \nA true friend would not ask you to do something wrong . \nThere are people who put pressure on the U.S. Media to sway this story and make the public believe if Mubarak leaves office , the big bad scary wold -LRB- muslim brotherhood -RRB- will move in . \nThose people will not trade one dictator and oppressor for another . \nThose protesters are begging us for help in obtaining freedom and democracy and if we turn our back on them , they will feel hopeless and that is what will make them latch onto radical groups . \nWhen we sent thousands of young American men and women to war in Iraq saying we were there to liberate them and bring freedom and democracy , how to we turn our backs on Egypt ? \nHow do we call a brutal dictator like Mubarak a friend just because he did what we paid him to do ? \nCan you begin to imagine what will happen to the protesters or family members of them , especially the ones who work to get the messages out , once the media leaves Egypt ? \nMurbarak is so desperate to stay in power , he will stage a phony terrorist act against his own people or even Israel , to make it look like he must stay in power to help Israel thwart any additional acts . \nHe could set up some of the protesters like he alreay tried to do with this phony story about an assassination attempt on the new VP . \n, and this mess with a broken gas pipe on fire . \nWon `` t trade one dictator for another ... wow you must be very young !!! ever hear of Iran ? \nJust because we score lower academically than several other countries does not mean we Americans are stupid . \nMubarak is getting rid of the journalist , and will fool the protesters away from Liberation Square , then do some serious damage to Egypt and the protesters . \nThat is why he must be made to step down now , not later . \nConcessions , when I see these reporters act as if Mubarak has made some great concessions and the protesters should be satisfied , they are either brainless or being told how to swing the story . \nThe first and only concession Mubarak should make is to leave . \nA sinister game is being played . \nAll of the sudden Mubarak will hold talks with the bug bad wolf -LRB- muslim brotherhood -RRB- the very people they painted as sooooo scary . \nIt does not matter if the whole world is watching , Mubarak can change laws today and unchange them tomorrow , and no one in the world will go to the rescue of those people . \nWe are hippocrits if we turn away . \nMubarak is on his way out in September , so why not get cozy with the next group who will take his place by helping to bring freedom and democracy , they will owe us , and remain friends . \nOr they will remember when they were begging for it and we turned our backs . \nIran is not Egypt , an education will help you truly understand the differences . \nNot only are the cultural and religious beliefs different , but they do n't even like each other . \nEygpt is fighting for personal rights and freedoms as citizens . \nSorry Lynn , they are right . \nIran and Egypt very different people and causes Kudos Anderson for great coverage of Egypt . \nI agree with the person who said you should get an award . \nThis is a Yes , or No , answer . \nNo smoke and mirrors roundabout answers please . \nFormer Secretary James Baker has admitted Mubarak is a dictator and should leave , Do you think dictators are ok , as long as they do what we want ? \nWhy do you think American Journalist are now down playing the need for Mubarak to go immediately ? \nIf Journalist from around the world came to cover Americans uprising against their government , do you thing our security agencies or others would find a way to prevent them from covering the story , and would our government cut off our ability to get the story out , such as Twitter , Internet , etc. ? \nDuring the Iraqi war , we did almost the same thing . \nAmericans were prevented from gaining access to Al-Jezeera 's news and website , so we could read other points of views of what was going on in Iraq . \nIf you find time to give an answer to any of these questions , Thank you . \nI think Anderson went in there and stirred the pot but did n't finish the job . \nA reporter at Democracy Now was able to go into the square and capture footage when Anderson went into hiding . \nNot a fan of this new style of reporting where a lot of questions are asked by the reporter and then they do n't stay around for the answers and resolutions . \nTo me a lot of the field reporting today is full of fractured sound bites and incomplete thoughts trying to support one agenda or another . \nThat is why most people are going to the internet , you can scan a lot more information more readily , read tweets from the people on the ground and get different points of view . \nI do not really trust any television reporter to give me the news . \nThose days are long gone . \nBravo !!! someone not easily taken in by the 24\\/7 hype . \nHow come the reporters seemed to spend all their time in the square instead of going out and actually talking to the other 82 million egyptians who have to work for a living . \nIf all these protesters are so poor how come they all have cell phones ... internet ... and can sit in the square for two weeks ! \nI admire courage as much as the next person and I hope Egypt ... a great people ... get out of this with a better ... freer ... life ... however the re ; porters are just stirring the pot ... as always . \nCNN should show the `` abuse '' of journalists in Egypt and what better way to show this , than to show what Anderson Cooper went through . \nI think it sneds the message straight home to people . \nThat foregin news correspondents are no different than military men and women who risk their lives everyday for us . \nUnfortunately , media does not have weapons to help in defending themselves . \nI think Anderson Cooper coming `` home '' was the right decision everyone needs a break , not to mention the mental stress that this has to cause . \nIf in a couple of months he can go back than good for him . \nIf not than that 's okay to . \nHe can do just as much good reporting from New York , and being safe and still bringing the events of the day to the American people . \nLike a Military personnwl I will say thank you to Anderson Cooper and all the media people for risking their lives , and sometimes people around the world do n't realize how dangerous these assignments are for you both mentally and physically . \nWhat are the chances that women will be represented in the new Egyptian government . \nAre there any prominent woman Egyptian leaders who have emerged and will have a seat at the table and\\/or can take a leadership role going forward ? \nFrst of all I would like to tell you how inspired I was of how courageous and brave of a reporter you are . \nI would like to know is , what was the most shocking scene that you witnessed while being in Egypt ? \nI too could n't help thinking ... what is poor Anderson 's mother going through . \nI love your reporting and humility . \nAlways apologizing for broadcasting conditions like low lighting Really ! \nDo n't apologize you are out there risking your life . \nMy question is do you actually BELIEVE ANYONE . \nEvery expert has a different take but I think they have a different agenda and I have come to not trust or believe anyone . \nWhom do you believe is being forth right here ? \nEl Baradei , Muslim Brotherhood , Mubarak etc ? \nThank you In retrospect , was covering the protest the correct story for a recognized and respected American international journalist to cover in Egypt , or do you think it would have been more relevant and appropriate for you to have covered why and how the US government at the heart of a democracy came to and continued to endorse Mubarack , a dictator , for so many decades ? \nIts a shame that the US supports and prop up many governments that are tyrants . \nMubarak and Omar Suleiman need to be removed ; however , that leaves a void for any militant organization to take charge . \nTherefore , the Egyptian people need to decide on whom they would like to be president and vice president so they can slide in when Mubarak and Suleiman slide out ! \nDoes anyone know why the interview with Anderson did n't air on Monday ? \n: That is such a perfect rrsouece that you are providing and you give it away for free . \nI love seeing web pages that understand the value of providing a quality rrsouece for free . \nIt is the old what goes around arrives around routine . \nDid you acquired plenty of links and also I see many trackbacks ??

{"id": "226", "time": "2011-02-06", "text": "HOWARD KURTZ , HOST : As journalists scramble to chronicle the uprising in Egypt , this is the week the story turned ugly in more ways than one . \nFrom CNN 's Anderson Cooper , to ABC 's Christiane Amanpour , from CBS 's Lara Logan to Fox 's Greg Palkot , correspondents have been attacked , beaten , chased , threatened , arrested , and detained . \nHow do you cover a dangerous story when you become a target for the mob ? \nOur guests include Katie Couric , just back from Egypt , and Sam Donaldson . \nFrom Cairo to Jerusalem to Britain to here in Washington , we 'll look at the way the crisis is being portrayed , the coverage of President Obama , the unorthodox criticism by Glenn Beck , the Egyptian television reporter who quit in protest , the trashing of Al Jazeera 's offices , and why the press never saw this coming . \nI 'm Howard Kurtz , and this is RELIABLE SOURCES . \nJournalists who race off to hot spots are accustomed to taking risks , but when violence erupted between Egyptian protesters and pro- government agitators , correspondents were not just caught in the crossfire , they were specifically targeted . \nIt 's a harrowing list , reporters from `` The New York Times '' and `` Washington Post '' arrested and released . \nLara Logan and her CBS crew first marched back to her hotel at gunpoint and later detained by police before being released . \nABC correspondent Brian Hartman threatened with beheading by a group of angry Egyptians who let his crew go only after a plea from their Lebanese cameraman . \nFox News correspondent Greg Palkot and his cameraman , badly beaten , then detained before being hospitalized for the injuries , released only after the Obama administration interceded . \nSome of these incidents were captured on tape , beginning with the one involving Anderson Cooper , who later started reporting from an undisclosed location . \nANDERSON COOPER , CNN ANCHOR : We were set upon by a crowd of pro- Mubarak supporters , punching us , trying to rip the clothes off my producer , trying to take the camera from my cameraman , punching me in the head several times in the body . \nAll of us were punched . \nI do n't mind telling you , I am a little scared because we frankly do n't know what the next few hours will hold . \nAnd I think there 's a lot of people who are scared tonight in Egypt . \nCHRISTIANE AMANPOUR , `` THIS WEEK WITH CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR '' : We left that angry crowd and got into our car . \nThey forced us into our car . \nAnd as we started to drive off , they hit the car with their fists over and over again , and threw a rock through the front window . \nThe glass is shattered all over our driver . \nDid they hurt you ? \nARWA DAMON , CNN CORRESPONDENT -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : As we are filming from a bridge , this man starts yelling at us to stop . \n`` Why are you filming ? '' \n`` Is this a nice image ? \nIt 's ugly . '' \nHe threatens to break our camera . \n-LRB- on camera -RRB- : Why is everybody so angry with the media ? \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : Because it does n't give a very good picture about us . \nKURTZ : One of network anchors who went to Egypt was Katie Couric , who found herself in the thick of the story . \nKATIE COURIC , CBS NEWS : This ancient city is the epicenter of an uprising by the people of this country who say now is the time for a new Egypt . \nAnd when the man many believe represents the old Egypt finally spoke to the people today , it only stoked the fires of rage and resentment . \nKURTZ : I spoke to the anchor and managing editor of the `` CBS Evening News '' a few moments ago by phone from New York . \nKATIE COURIC , `` CBS EVENING NEWS '' : Hi , Howie . \nKURTZ : You waded into that crowd in Cairo . \nWe just saw that clip . \nWhy did you decide to do that ? \nIt looks like things got pretty tense there for a few minutes . \nCOURIC : I think that was in the initial stages of the tension . \nYou know , we had been shooting from other things . \nI had an interview with Amr Moussa , who is the secretary general of the Arab League , and then went and talked to Mohamed ElBaradei . \nAnd we had heard that things were getting a bit dicey in the square . \nSo of course we decided , well , let 's go and find out what 's going on . \nAnd it was very clear as we tried to get into the square itself -- we were just actually on a road leading to the square -- that things had taken a very ugly turn . \nThe atmosphere had changed dramatically from the night before , when it felt , as I said on the `` Evening News , '' like a turbo charged street festival . \nAll these pro-Mubarak industry protesters were marching into the square sort of in pretty big numbers . \nAnd their attitude toward the media was very , very different than the anti- government protesters . \nAt first I thought -- COURIC : Well , yes , I was a little nervous . \nBut at first , I just thought it was a boisterous crowd . \nYou know , when you have a television camera , it sometimes attracts some pretty crazy behavior , people wanting to get in the shot , wanting to scream and yell and carry on and make faces and signs , et cetera . \nSo I thought , really , it was just one of those situations , but it became clear pretty quickly that this was a very different scenario , that this was fueled by a great deal of anger and animosity towards the press , towards the United States . \nAnd when I got surrounded , and this one sort of young Egyptian man pushed me , I thought -- I looked at his eyes , and they were so full of rage . \nI thought , gee , this is a pretty precarious situation I need to walk away from here , and so that 's what I did . \nI just kind of walked away and got out of there . \nKURTZ : It kind of leads to my next question . \nSome people are saying , you know , maybe American anchors should n't go into these volatile situations . \nThey attract so much attention . \nPerhaps they become targets and distract from the story . \nI can see both sides of that argument . \nWhat do you think ? \nCOURIC : Well , I do n't really see the one side of the argument . \nI mean , first of all , no one knew I was an anchor . \nThey saw me as another journalist , as far as I know . \nAnd , you know , hopefully people who are in anchor roles have spent years out in the field reporting and have covered some of the biggest stories that have unfolded across the world for a fair amount of time and are experienced . \nAnd so , you know , I think that you have to be smart and responsible and use good judgment . \nBut I do n't really think that we were necessarily targeted in terms of being anchors . \nI heard of journalists getting abused from `` The New York Times , '' from French news agencies . \nI talked to a couple of still photographers who had their cameras taken by the police and their film confiscated . \nSo I do n't think people were making judgments and saying , oh , she 's the anchor of the `` CBS Evening News , '' let 's go after her . \nBut on that point , clearly they were going after some journalists . \nAnd when we reached that 48-hour period where Anderson Cooper of CNN was attacked , where your CBS colleague Lara Logan was arrested and eventually released , what was your reaction to these attacks being in the middle of that cauldron ? \nCOURIC : Well , obviously , it was very unnerving . \nAnd , I mean , I think it was pretty clear why they were doing it . \nYou know , I think heretofore , most of the coverage of the anti- government protesters had been pretty positive . \nAnd the government clearly knew they were losing the propaganda war , if you will . \nAnd they wanted these images coming out of Tahrir Square and elsewhere to stop . \nSo what 's the best way of doing that ? \nIt 's obviously to intimidate , threaten and attack reporters . \nKURTZ : Of course , but that then became the story . \nAnd the government got a whole new wave of bad publicity . \nWhile you were in Egypt , Katie , to what extent were you able to get a sense of the passion of these protesters and why some of these people who were not especially political in the past were joining a mass protest that frankly none of us had seen coming ? \nCOURIC : Well , I think that , clearly , this had been simmering for a long time . \nI had Lara Logan go a piece in Alexandria last week on Khaled Saeed , who was a young Egyptian man who had been beaten up by the police because he was really what ignited this -- partially ignited this tinderbox of simmering anger and rage . \nHe was beaten up by police . \nA Facebook page was started . \nI think it 's fascinating , the role social media played in this . \nI do n't think you can say it was solely the result of social media , but I think it spread the word like wildfire and got young people incredibly engaged and organized in this process in a way that they would n't otherwise have been able to do . \nBut I think that , you know , people -- the joblessness , jobless rate , the lack of employment is so terrible in Egypt , the poverty rate is so intense and severe . \nAnd I think people were just -- their anger just came to the surface . \nAnd I think that they -- it was really a people 's revolution . \nPeople felt empowered , and you felt that when you went in Tahrir Square the first night I got there , because it was a peaceful protest , and you felt like people were actually going to speak out and try to enact change . \nAnd it was actually an incredibly inspiring thing to witness . \nKURTZ : And a revolution that is still unfolding before our eyes . \nKatie Couric , we 're glad you 're back home safe . \nThanks very much for joining us . \n-LRB- END VIDEOTAPE -RRB- KURTZ : And we 're continuing our coverage of the unfolding events in Egypt . \nJoining us now from Cairo , Christopher Dickey , Paris bureau chief and Middle East regional editor for `` Newsweek . '' \nIn Jerusalem , Janine Zacharia , who covers the Middle East for `` The Washington Post . '' \nShe 's just back from Egypt . \nAnd here in Washington , Frank Sesno , former CNN Washington bureau chief and now professor of Media and Public Affairs at The George Washington University . \nFrank Sesno , to some extent , these brutal attacks against journalists by these thugs who are working for -- or in the employ of the Mubarak regime , did n't they backfire ? \nFRANK SESNO , THE GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY : Yes , they did backfire , because they turned an even harsher glare on the regime in Egypt , they distracted the world , in a sense , from the debate of the street , and put it on these sort of -- the human rights essentially , the human rights record . \nAnd it turned the -- I think you could argue that it turned the Obama administration , many other governments around the world , even more harshly toward the notion that there needs to be real deep and lasting change , because this veneer of civilization is being challenged . \nKURTZ : Chris Dickey , in Cairo , as somebody has been there through most of this story , what was the government hoping to gain by going after journalists , arresting them , threatening them , in many cases physically attacking them ? \nIt just seems like this has made the coverage more negative toward that regime . \nCHRISTOPHER DICKEY , MIDDLE EAST REGIONAL EDITOR , `` NEWSWEEK '' : Well , absolutely , it has . \nBut the regime was n't thinking about the coverage in that sense . \nIt was thinking about its domestic constituency , what it was going to tell the people here in Egypt . \nAnd it wanted to tell them that this protest in Tahrir Square , that 's not Egyptian , it 's all a foreign conspiracy . \nIt 's all being run by these -- these journalists are all part of that foreign conspiracy . \nAnd that 's why although we 're talking about journalists , really , it 's worse than that . \nYou 've not only had attacks on journalists , you 've had attacks on people just because they were foreigners . \nAnd this has just been the constant drumbeat of the Mubarak administration , even as the people who have been appointed to run things now , Prime Minister Ahmed Shafiq and Vice President Omar Suleiman are saying , oh , we 're against attacking foreigners , we 're against attacking journalists . \nWhat we 're seeing is one thing being said to the outside world and another thing being said to incite the people inside Egypt . \nAnd that 's a very old game by this regime . \nAnd Janine Zacharia , the pictures , of course , speak very loudly . \nAnd I wonder whether you think journalists kind of became the face of the thuggish tactics of the Mubarak regime when they were , in effect , providing first-person witness to the fact that people were willing to use guns and people were willing to use clubs and rocks against those who were trying to cover the story . \nJANINE ZACHARIA , JERUSALEM BUREAU CHIEF , `` THE WASHINGTON POST '' : Well , it 's no doubt that journalists became part of the story when it becomes this kind of high profile and you have senior top anchors flying in there . \nThat 's going to be the case . \nBut I thought , you know , one of things to point out here is that what this really showed -- and it echoes a little bit what Frank said , is sort of the history of how the Egyptians deal with their own media . \nI mean , they just do n't have a culture of free media , of people coming in . \nEven when I was there in Cairo the day -- the Thursday before the `` Day of Rage , '' so two days after that first protest , they had a press conference at the party headquarters , and you saw -- I was reminded again of how the Egyptian media are so cowed , they could n't ask the most obvious question that day , which namely was , where is President Mubarak ? \nWe had n't seen him yet . \nThey asked very simple questions . \nSo , then , here you are , you 're the Egyptian regime , and you 're seeing all these people reporting all these things . \nYou try shutting down their Internet and their phones , and that does n't work , so , instead , you arrest them . \nAnd it really shows the Egypt that the media has not covered -- the foreign media -- in any kind of serious , sustained way , at least for the last coupe of years . \nSESNO : There 's one other thing very interesting , Howie , that has been the backlash , as you say , from all this . \nI got an e-mail earlier this morning from Theo May , a young man who 's over there as a freelance journalist who spent a lot of time on the ground . \nHe says one of things that these beatings and the harassment of these journalists has done has made it harder to write a story from the point of view of the Mubarak government , that he 's found , actually , in a lot of his travels , that there 's a fear bit of support for Mubarak in terms of the security -- the oasis of relative security that Egypt has become . \nYou have activities like this on the street with reporters being targeted and harassed . \nNot going to write a story that 's favorable or has the point of view very favorably of the Egyptian government . \nKURTZ : But to some extent , Chris Dickey , it worked for a while in the sense that I saw fewer live shots for several days , we saw Anderson Cooper of CNN broadcasting from his hotel room , not in the streets . \nNBC 's Richard Engel has done an extraordinary job , up on a balcony for many of his live shots . \nSo , did the regime get what it wanted , which was to kind of tamp down the live pictures of the clashes in that square ? \nDICKEY : Well , to the extent that that 's all it wanted , yes , it did reduce some of the coverage . \nThe other vital thing that it did was shut down a lot of the camera positions in high-rise hotels around the square . \nThat 's where it really started to black out the coverage . \nIt was n't just the people going into the square . \nAnd yes , it 's been very scary going in and out . \nOften , when you 're in the square , there 's not that much of a problem . \nBut going in and out , you wind up , all of a sudden , confronted by people , you 're not sure who they are . \nThey 're carrying clubs , they may be very angry . \nYou know , what you need to understand , though , is that this is something that the Egyptians have lived with for a long time . \nA lot of these thugs are normally employed by government party parliamentarians , and they 're used during elections to intimidate voters . \nIt 's not like they just sprang out of nowhere . \nThis is part of the system . \nAnd this is something that -- this is precisely what the people who are protesting are protesting against . \nDICKEY : And to the extent that they created a situation where the international journalistic community identified directly with those people and their problems , they created a disaster for public relations in Egypt . \nKURTZ : And now the whole world is seeing it close up . \nJanine Zacharia , I wonder if there was some irrational exuberance , to use a Wall Street term , in the early coverage of these protests . \nYou have a front page story in `` The Washington Post '' today saying that maybe some observers , some journalists were expecting the Egyptian governments to topple rather quickly like Tunisia , and now it looks like it will be more of a long slog . \nZACHARIA : I was n't one of those journalists , really . \nBut I was wrong on the other end . \nI really thought this was going to be over in four days , having covered Egypt in one way or another for the last 15 years , knowing the way that they deal with these kinds of situations , and having been there just a few months ago and taken the pulse , and it was so different . \nSo I think , yes , there was that euphoria of expectation . \nBut I have to tell you , on that Friday night , that `` Day of Rage , '' when I 'm sure everybody was watching at home , those battles on the bridges , I was one of those journalists up in my hotel room , on the balcony , along with a lot of other journalists , because you could not physically breathe outside . \nThey must have fired 2,000 cans of tear gas . \nPlus , the building next to me on fire . \nAnd I got a sense that night when the army rolled in . \nI did n't read it the same way everybody else did . \nI did n't think that , oh , this is the army with the people . \nI saw it more as , this is going to be a long stalemate , the army is here , it 's not really clear what their role is . \nAnd even now , today , we 're not rally sure how this is going to end , as I pointed out in my piece today . \nSo it 's really -- ZACHARIA : I think we 're headed into a long battle here , yes . \nAnd where the pictures may not be quite as vital because the violence has subsided , at least for a moment . \nLet me get a break . \nWe 'll continue our conversation in just a moment . \nKURTZ : And we 're continuing our conversation about the unfolding events in Egypt . \nLet me go back to Cairo and Christopher Dickey . \nChris , it 's no secret that American media appetite for international coverage has shrunk over the years excepts in extraordinary situations like this . \nIf the violence were to continue to subside , and we do n't have the dramatic pictures of protesters being -- you know , clashing with the pro-government agitators , and the story moves behind the scenes , negotiations , diplomacy , do you think coverage of this story within days will begin to fade a bit ? \nDICKEY : Oh , I think it 's already fading . \nI think you 've seen a lot of people leave . \nYou know , the big anchors , they 're gone . \nThe television coverage of not just the violence , the overall television coverage , has diminished considerably , and it will continue to do so . \nBut the people who are in sort of quasi-leadership positions of the protest and of this movement , this democracy movement , they understand that perfectly well , and they 're looking for new ways to keep continuing the pressure on the government . \nAnd I think they are going to looking to the Americans to help them , but I think they also will have a lot of different tactics from boycotts and other kinds of measures that they can take , which wo n't be as mediagenic , but which may still help them achieve their goals . \nKURTZ : Frank Sesno , just because NBC 's Brian Williams and CBS ' Katie Couric and CNN 's Anderson Cooper have either left , or are in the process of leaving , does n't mean the coverage has to fade . \nBut it seems to me that there was a narrative early on -- this was driven by Twitter , this was driven by Facebook -- and that Mubarak , somebody joked , will he be gone by the Super Bowl ? \nIt does n't always work out quite so neatly , does it ? \nSESNO : It does n't work out quite so neatly . \nAnd the problem is , Howie , that we are utterly addicted to the picture . \nWe are addicted to the narrative , to this great dramatic story . \nAnd when the great dramatic story of these millions of people in the streets suddenly fades , even though the story , what 's happening behind the scenes , is going to be more important , probably , to what happens to Egypt 's future , more important to the region , that 's going to require more and better and smarter coverage , not less . \nAnd we are in real danger here of missing the real story if everybody bails out of town -- not everybody , because this wo n't go away . \nWe 'll still get the coverage , but will it get the attention that it needs ? \nAnd will we seize this , what needs to be a teachable moment for the world ? \nThis a pivotal part of the planet , and what happens there matters to everybody . \nKURTZ : And Janine Zacharia , since you 're in Jerusalem , this is playing out very differently , is it not , in the Israeli press , which does n't welcome the toppling of Mubarak , which might be cheered in many corners in America ? \nDo Israeli commentators care less about the fact that he has been an autocrat for nearly three decades and looking at it more through the lens of Israeli security ? \nClearly , the Israeli security issue definitely trumps . \nThe narrative here is one of deep concern about what 's going to happen , especially the expectation that the Muslim Brotherhood will have some role in any new government . \nSo you definitely see a lot of editorials along those lines . \nIn terms of the news coverage , I would say though that even here , where this is really like an existential issue for Israel , the new coverage is starting to fade . \nToday 's front page does not have a story about Egypt . \nIt 's trumped by a fire at IKEA that burned down yesterday , and the story about the appointment of the next chief of staff . \nSo , yes , it 's certainly of concern to the leaders . \nBut how long Israelis will sustain interest , I 'm not quite sure . \nAnd , of course , tonight the big story will be the Super Bowl here in the United States . \nAnd Bill O'Reilly interviewing President Obama . \nHe 'll do a big number for that . \nJanine Zacharia in Jerusalem , Christopher Dickey in Cairo , Frank Sesno , here , thanks very much for joining us . \nWe 're going to take a commercial break . \nOur coverage continues on the other side . \nHOWARD KURTZ , HOST : Welcome back . \nWe 're going to go now to Spokane Washington and talk to Lawrence Pintak . \nHe 's a former Middle East correspondent for CBS News , the founding dean of the Edward R. Murrow College of Communication at Washington State University . \nLawrence , you 've written about Al Jazeera and its crucial role in the Egyptian events of the last two weeks . \nWhy is that Arab satellite network , in your view , been so important ? \nLAWRENCE PINTAK , FMR . \nMIDDLE EAST CORRESPONDENT , CBS NEWS : You can draw a direct line from the birth of the Arab media revolution which started with Jazeera 's launch in '96 and this uprising . \nSocial media has been very important for the activists to organize in this uprising . \nBut the fact that people can watch this play out on television has been the game-changer . \nKURTZ : Why are we -- you lived in Cairo for some time . \nLeaving aside the pro-Mubarak thugs who were sent out there to rough up protesters and journalists , why are we not seeing from the crowds more hostility toward Americans , American journalists in general , and in particular ? \nWas that revealing at all ? \nPINTAK : Well , there 's never been hostility toward American journalists on the part of the average Egyptian . \nThere has been hostility toward the media on the part of the government . \nAnd what American journalists are enduring now is something that Egyptian journalists and other Arab journalists have endured for a very long time . \nKURTZ : There was , as you know -- I was going to play the clip , we do n't have it right now , a reporter for Nile TV who was going -- I 'm sorry , we do have it . \nLet 's roll that . \nI want to ask you about it on the other side . \nShe resigned from the state-run television . \nHere 's her explanation . \nSHAHIRA AMIN , FMR . \nCORRESPONDENT : We were just covering the pro-Mubarak rallies , which I thought was ridiculous . \nAnd I do n't want to be part of their propaganda machine . \nAnd I heard the chants of the protesters and decided to get off in Tahrir Square and join the protesters , because I 'm siding with the people , not the regime . \nKURTZ : That was Shahira Amin . \nAnd I 'm sorry , she was surprised that Egyptian state-run television is n't fair and balanced and that she was only covering one side of the story ? \nPINTAK : Well , I suspect she was n't surprised . \nBut the fact is that Arab journalists have been moving forward in how they approach their job for a long time . \nAnd obviously , the holdouts are those working for the overtly government-owned stations and papers . \nBut we did a survey of Arab journalists a couple of years ago , and we found that 75 percent of them said they saw it as their mission to create political and social change . \nAnd that was even true of those on government-owned papers and TV stations , but they were a little more constrained in what they could do . \nKURTZ : All right . \nLawrence Pintak , I have to interrupt you . \nWe 're going to toss now to Candy Crowley for some breaking news . \nShe 's going to talk to the Egyptian prime minister by phone -- Candy . \nCANDY CROWLEY , HOST , `` STATE OF THE UNION '' : I 'm Candy Crowley in Washington . \nWe do indeed have the chance to interview Ahmed Shafiq . \nHe is the prime minister of Egypt , and we have him on the phone now . \nMr. Prime Minister , can you hear me ? \nAHMED SHAFIQ , EGYPTIAN PRIME MINISTER : Now I hear you good . \nThank you so much . \nCROWLEY : Let me ask you first -- there are reports that the state of emergency , which I believe has been in place in Egypt since 1981 , has been lifted . \nCan you confirm that or deny it ? \nSHAFIQ : May I ask you kindly to repeat your message in a more louder voice , please ? \nI was asking , has the state of emergency in Egypt been lifted ? \nSHAFIQ : If you are speaking now concerning the emergency now in Egypt , the emergency situation , I do n't say that the problem be over now . \nBut the situation today is extremely better than yesterday , and the discussion between the old factions are going on . \nWe spoke together today with all the ideas , reaction -LRB- ph -RRB- , in the fields . \nHopefully tomorrow or after tomorrow we will get better raises now , because I think the ideas are nearer each other now than before . \nCROWLEY : Mr. Prime Minister , our reporters on the scene in Cairo tell us that while you negotiate about a democratic process , there are still arrests of local and international human rights activists , as well as journalists . \nWhy are you arresting them ? \nSHAFIQ : I did n't understand you . \nI did n't understand you . \nCROWLEY : We are told that you are arresting human rights activists and journalists . \nI do n't hear well . \nI do n't hear well now . \nCROWLEY : Can you tell us about President Mubarak ? \nDo you expect him any time soon to resign ? \nSHAFIQ : If you are speaking about the situation with President Mubarak now , you know that President Mubarak will leave in September . \nAnd now the discussion is if he 's able to leave before or not . \nWe insist here in Egypt to continue his period until the end of September , the month of September , because during this period we will be headed by the president , and a lot of points must be covered before he leaves . \nSo I think we are in bad need for the president -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- because that will be easier for us to fulfill the mission we are looking to get . \nCROWLEY : Will the demonstrators accept President Mubarak staying until September ? \nSHAFIQ : Because he 's -- the former period must be ended in September , and we have another six months to work with him , changing all the points , or working on changing all the points that we discussed with the majority of the ideas existing in the market here . \nAnd we think that this formal action must be respected , and no need to change this time as far as we are already changing all the needed points to be changed . \nCROWLEY : Mr. Mubarak will not leave until September . \nSHAFIQ : Yes , exactly , in September . \nCROWLEY : Let me ask you by arrests by the military police . \nWhy are they arresting -- CROWLEY : About the detention of human rights activists . \nWhy are you detaining them ? \nSHAFIQ : Oh , frankly speaking , there is some problem . \nIt 's not intended at all , my dear . \nFrankly speaking , I insist to assure all the authorities here not to ban -LRB- ph -RRB- anyone or not to bother anyone doing his work -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- . \nBut during some periods as such the period we are passing now , we will not be -- it 's rather difficult to be sure 100 percent that this man or either man gets some bad behavior concerning the foreigners here , and he does n't understand their work or their job or something like that . \nSo we have to excuse him for such action done with this group because this is not at all intended , my dear . \nAnd we insist to cover this point . \nAnd I repeat again , hopefully that will not be -- this phenomenon will not be existing after that . \nCROWLEY : We were told by our reporters today that you have arrested another Al Jazeera reporter from Al Jazeera English , as well as more human rights activists . \nAnd it 's the Egyptian military police . \nDo you have a way to get them to stop those arrests ? \nSHAFIQ : After our telephone now , after our call now , I will go directly to check this point . \nAnd if you permit me , I will give you an answer if there is something like that . \nBut they are not allowed at all to do something like that . \nCROWLEY : We would appreciate a return call . \nThat would be great . \nAnd finally , let me try one more time . \nCROWLEY : There are reports that the state of emergency that was imposed in Egypt in 1981 has been lifted . \nSHAFIQ : Frankly , I did n't understand your meaning now . \nCan you repeat it for me ? \nCROWLEY : A state of emergency declaration . \nHas that been lifted ? \nSHAFIQ : Do you want to say that keeping the case of emergency during the oldest period since 1981 until now , or something like that ? \nCROWLEY : Has the state of emergency been lifted ? \nSHAFIQ : I think if I understand perfectly your paragraph now , I think even this point is discussed now . \nAnd I do n't know . \nI ca n't give you my answer perfectly now because I ca n't get the meaning exactly that you mean . \nThank you so much for taking the time . \nWe look forward to talking to you again when you 've checked into these things . \nWe totally appreciate your time . \nSHAFIQ : Please be sure that concerning our friends working here with us , I will assure now that nothing is banning the work , and excusing for any action like that against them . \nCROWLEY : Thank you so much . \nWe look forward to that . \nI appreciate your time . \nThank you , my dear . \nWe 're going to take a quick break . \nWhen we come back , reliable sources . \nKURTZ : We pick up our coverage of the crisis in Egypt . \nJoining us now via an Internet connection , from Cambridge , England , is John Burns , chief foreign correspondent for `` The New York Times . '' \nAnd here in Washington , Abderrahim Foukara , Washington bureau chief for Al Jazeera English . \nOur thanks to Lawrence Pintak , who we spoke to earlier . \nMr. Foukara , Egypt first banned Al Jazeera , as we discussed when you were on the program last week . \nYour Cairo office has been ransacked and burned . \nYou 've had a couple of staff members detained and then released . \nOther news organizations as well . \nDo you feel like your network is being singled out by Egypt ? \nABDERRAHIM FOUKARA , WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF , AL JAZEERA ENGLISH : Well , the feeling is that all networks and all news outlets have been targeted by these measures in Egypt . \nKURTZ : But only Al Jazeera has been banned . \nFOUKARA : But Al Jazeera in particular . \nAnd the reason is that Al Jazeera Arabic , which I work for , that 's obviously the most watched channel in Egypt and in the rest of the Arab region . \nSo the coverage of Al Jazeera Arabic is of true consequence . \nBut Al Jazeera English is of true consequence to the world at large , particularly here in the United States . \nSo we have seen both channels actually harassed in different ways . \nKURTZ : You have managed to stay on the air most of the time , despite the fact that , officially , you 're not allowed to broadcast from Egypt . \nI mean , we have found all sorts of different ways to go around the ban . \nBoth the Arabic and the English continue to operate from inside Egypt . \nEgypt continues to be the main story on both channels . \nKURTZ : John Burns , you reported for many years from Iraq , a very dangerous place for journalists . \nBut the danger in Egypt is very different , is it not ? \nJOHN BURNS , CHIEF FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT , `` THE NEW YORK TIMES '' : Hello ? \nKURTZ : We seem to be having an audio problem . \nWe 'll see if we can go back to John Burns . \nSo I 'll pick up with you , Abderrahim . \nFascinating , that the Web site of Al Jazeera English , the traffic has increased 2,500 percent since this crisis began . \nThat is the only way that most Americans can get Al Jazeera coverage . \nYou 're on in only a couple of markets across the United States . \nFrank Rich , writing in `` The New York Times '' today -- the columnist -- saying that , this is censorship , his word , by America 's corporate gatekeepers . \nHe compares Al Jazeera to the Voice of America behind the Iron Curtain . \nNow , censorship happens to be a term used for government , but do you feel like there 's been a concerted effort to keep Al Jazeera English off of the American airwaves ? \nFOUKARA : Well , I mean , we 've had different things and different interpretations over the years since Al Jazeera English was launched a few years ago . \nBut , look , what matters now is that this is a huge story . \nIt 's a huge story not just for Egyptians or Arabs , it 's a huge story obviously for the United States as well . \nThe fact that Al Jazeera does provide this coverage is food for thought , whether it 's a conspiracy against Al Jazeera , censorship , whatever it is , but it provides a service that in crucial times like this , Americans do need to have it to see what 's going on in a story that affects them directly . \nKURTZ : There are those who say -- are very critical of Al Jazeera , say that it 's anti-American , say that it 's anti-Israel . \nI know you 've heard these criticisms before , but that -- I mean , you know , to some of these cable operators , these big companies , you have been kind of radioactive . \nFOUKARA : Well , look , criticism , you 'll always be criticized for one thing or another . \nAll news media are imperfect media in an imperfect world . \nTalking of the Israelis , it 's interesting that the Israelis have over the years sort of appreciated the coverage of Al Jazeera more , perhaps , than people in other parts of the world like the United States or Canada . \nBut ultimately , when you have a big story like this , and when you have not just the public , but even the international community scratching their heads and saying , how come this has come about ? \nAnd you have a channel that has been focusing on this story not just for weeks , but for months , it tells you something . \nThat regardless of its flaws , it does provide crucial coverage of a crucial story . \nKURTZ : But do its flaws include a point of view ? \nOr are you trying to be fair , even to Americans , even to Israelis ? \nCertainly , there 's an American appetite now for Al Jazeera English . \nBut are you trying to be fair , or do you have a point of view ? \nFOUKARA : Well , the reporters , for example , do sometimes approach the story from different angles , and that creates a controversy for sure . \nBut both Arabic and English have provided open platforms not just to governments in the Arab world , but governments in Israel , governments in the United States , governments in Canada , other parts of the world . \nEverybody who has a point of view and is willing to express it comes to express it . \nIf they do n't want to express it , that 's their problem . \nKURTZ : Abderrahim Foukara , appreciate your stopping by this morning . \nMy apologies to John Burns of `` The New York Times . '' \nWe could see him , but we could n't hear him , which is sometimes the danger of relying on an Internet connection . \nLet me get a break . \nSam Donaldson and John Fund join us from the Reagan Library in California in just a moment . \nKURTZ : Joining us now at the Reagan Library , in Simi Valley , California , Sam Donaldson , longtime ABC correspondent and former host of `` This Week '' ; and John Fund , columnist for `` The Wall Street Journal . '' \nSam Donaldson , I want to briefly touch on Al Jazeera . \nI just interviewed their Washington bureau chief . \nYou had some nice things to say about the network 's coverage . \nBill O'Reilly took issue with that . \nHe said , `` Al Jazeera makes a living blaming most problems in the Middle East on the USA . \nSAM DONALDSON , FMR . \nABC CORRESPONDENT : Yes . \nDo n't tell all the people here at the Reagan Library , will you ? \nKeep it under your hat . \nYou know , Al Jazeera , I thought , performed a service in fanning the flames in Egypt . \nBut , hey , is that so bad ? \nIf Al Jazeera brings information to people in the Arab world , it makes them think they should throw over their dictators , should we complain ? \nNow , Howie , Al Jazeera says things about us we do n't like , and some things that are not true . \nAnd I certainly do n't subscribe to that , except a news service of any kind has got to be able to say whatever it wants , otherwise it 's a contradiction in terms . \nKURTZ : All right . \nLet me let John Fund say whatever he wants right now . \nJOHN FUND , COLUMNIST , `` THE WALL STREET JOURNAL '' : Well , I have toured Al Jazeera 's headquarters in Qatar , and I think they have come a long way . \nI remember back in 2003 and 2004 , they had one of their correspondents who was a paid spy for Saddam Hussein . \nI think they 've cleaned up their act . \nI think they 're providing better information . \nAnd frankly , the Arab street is never going to trust Western media . \nAl Jazeera is about as good as we 're going to get in terms of objective analysis for the Arab world , and I 'm glad that it 's there . \nKURTZ : Almost a qualifying endorsement from John Fund . \nLet me play for you a bit of Glenn Beck from Fox News Channel , getting a lot of attention this week for things he is saying about the situation in Egypt . \nWe 'll ask you a question on the other side . \nGLENN BECK , FOX NEWS : Please , if you take anything away from this show , please be prepared . \nLook at Egypt right now . \nThese were people that were not prepared . \nTomorrow , the radicals here in America that are operating as Marxists and communists , that are in support of this -- but the Muslim Brotherhood is n't just operating overseas . \nWe 're not done with them yet . \nWe showed you in their own words that their goals include the transformation of America into an Islamic state , the destruction of the Western world . \nKURTZ : Sam , now , Glenn Beck has got a following . \nHe 's got a rather unique style . \nHe can say whatever he wants . \nBut is there a point when he tries to tie the American left wing to the caliphate that 's going to take over the Middle East , where other commentators need to say , hey , this is pretty out there ? \nDONALDSON : You should have heard what Father Coughlin -- and I 've heard the radio tapes in the '30s -- call Franklin Roosevelt . \nWe could n't use it on the air . \nIt 's too bad when people want to make their case by just calling names . \nBut I say to people , hey , if I 'm arguing with you , and you ca n't beat my argument with another argument , but you just to have call me a name , I win . \nSo I would n't pay that much attention to him . \nIt 's nonsense to think that we are going to have an Islamic state here . \nI mean , not in the lifetime of my great-great-grandchildren . \nI do n't know what the future is going to hold after that , but the diverse views in this country , I think , are a good thing . \nKURTZ : John Fund , no less a conservative than Bill Kristol of `` The Weekly Standard , '' writing the other day that when Beck uses this kind of language , he sounds like the John Birch Society and he marginalizes himself . \nDo you agree with that , or would you disagree ? \nFUND : Look , Glenn Beck is a commentator . \nAnd I think that part of his analysis is accurate . \nLook , we have to remember that the Iranian regime , when it collapsed , was going to be a democracy . \nThen it was hijacked by Islamic extremists , and we are still dealing with them 30 years later and their nuclear weapons . \nAnd obviously Europe has a lot more to worry about . \nYou know , by 2030 , nine percent of Europe is going to be Muslim . \nBut to carry that and take it into apocalyptic conspiracy terms about America becoming an Islamic state , that goes too far . \nAnd I think if Glenn Beck had to do it over again , he might rethink that . \nKURTZ : All right . \nI 'm coming up on a break . \nLet me get a 30 - second answer from each of you . \nDo you think that the media coverage has engaged in the traditional blame game toward President Obama and his handling of the Egyptian situation ? \nIt seemed like that might be happening early on . \nLately , it seems like the situation has kind of gotten so far out of any other country 's influence , that maybe there is less of that . \nJohn Fund , we 'll start with you . \nFUND : I think there 's finally some humility not only in American politics regarding Egypt , but also the American media . \nThe situation is complicated enough , the cultures are different enough . \nI think we 're holding back , and I think that 's a good thing . \nHumility , good thing . \nDONALDSON : I think the media really swings with the story . \nMedia really swings with the story . \nAnd often we 're wrong , and sometimes the story is messy , as it is now , and we do n't know what 's happening . \nI just -- stick to it . \nThere is sometimes a tendency to think that a president can control almost anything . \nAnd right now that 's not the case . \nGot to get that break . \nAnd when we come back , we 'll talk about the reason that you folks are there , the 100th anniversary of Ronald Reagan 's birth . \nKURTZ : Ronald Reagan 's 100th birthday would have been today . \nThe press was far more critical of the 40th president when he was in the White House than is the case today . \nJust look at how he dealt with some of those pesky reporters . \nDONALDSON : In talking about the continuing recession tonight , you have blamed mistakes for the past and you have blamed the Congress . \nDoes any of the blame belong to you ? \nRONALD REAGAN , PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES : Yes , because for many years I was a Democrat . \nKURTZ : Sam Donaldson , he used humor there to slap away your question . \nAnd that was not unlike Ronald Reagan , was it ? \nDONALDSON : That 's right . \nThat was game , set , match . \nWe all sat down and laughed . \nHe would turn things around with one line . \nHe went on to explain what he meant on that , but the president said whatever he -- came into his mind . \nAnd often , his staff would run round after a news conference and say , `` Well , what the president meant to say was '' -- you understand it was just a hypothetical case . \nReagan had very little guile that I saw . \nHe would say what he thought the case was . \nAnd I 've maintained , John , that if you put a polygraph to anything he said , he would pass . \nHe believed what he said . \nKURTZ : At the time , John Fund , the press often depicted President Reagan as kind of uninformed , detached , somewhat insensitive toward the poor . \nDo you think there has been a marked correction since his death in that , in effect , journalists have given him more credit for an essential -LRB- ph -RRB- presidency than was the case at the time ? \nFUND : Oh , sure . \nWe now have his diaries and we now have his correspondence . \nSo we know he was a pretty sophisticated thinker and he read a lot . \nWe also know that the media , I think , has stepped back and realized that Reagan was sometimes playing a game with them . \nReagan loved being underestimated , because in being underestimated , he was able to accomplish a lot more . \nAnd he loved the fact that people thought of him as just an actor . \nActually , what he told David Brinkley just before he left office was fascinating . \nBrinkley asked him , `` How in the world could you do this job , Mr. President , if you have been an actor all these years ? '' \nAnd Reagan said , `` I 've often thought about that . \nHow in the world could I do this job if I had n't been an actor ? '' \nKURTZ : All right . \nWell , with that , we 're going to have to bring the curtain down on John Fund and Sam Donaldson . \nAnd CNN will have live coverage of the Reagan centennial celebration starting this afternoon . \nThat 's at 2:00 p.m. Eastern . \nThat 's it for RELIABLE SOURCES . \nWe 're going to go over now to `` STATE OF THE UNION '' with Candy Crowley . \nThank you for watching . \nGlad we were able to bring you some breaking news , the interview with the Egyptian prime minister , during this hour . \nAnd we 'll be on this story next week and probably for some weeks to come , whether it stays on television or not . \nThat is to say , whether the pictures , the dramatic pictures that we have seen from Tahrir Square , whether they fade or not . \nIt 's important for journalists to stay on this story . \nSometimes we have been accused of not sufficiently covering stories when they did n't have dramatic pictures . \nI think that perhaps will not be the case this time . \n`` STATE OF THE UNION '' with Candy Crowley begins right now . \n"}

{"id": "43", "time": "2011-02-06", "text": "Egypt 's Opposition Leader ElBaradei Speaks ; Interview with Egypt 's Former Trade Minister Aired February 6 , 2011 - 10:00 ET THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT . \nFAREED ZAKARIA , HOST : This is a special edition of GPS , THE GLOBAL PUBLIC SQUARE . \nWelcome to all of you in the United States and around the world . \nI 'm Fareed Zakaria . \nWe have a terrific show for you today . \nFirst up , the latest from Egypt . \nWe 'll talk to reporters stationed in that country . \nI will also bring you interviews with two important Egyptian voices with different views . \nIn a disorganized opposition movement , Mohamed ElBaradei might be the closest thing Egypt has to a leader of the opposition . \nEver since the crisis started , he 's been saying Mubarak has to leave , but Mubarak 's still there , so what 's the next step ? \nThen , a unique insight into the mind of the Egyptian government . \nRachid Mohamed Rachid was Egypt 's trade minister until President Mubarak dissolved his government nine days ago . \nHe 'll talk to us about what is going on in his country . \nThen , you heard last week what British Prime Minister David Cameron thinks about Egypt . \nToday you 'll hear his thoughts on the crucial question that everyone is watching . \nCan you cut deficits and get economic growth ? \nHe also talks to me about everything from Europe to the royal wedding . \nFirst , my thoughts on Egypt . \nA specter is haunting the West , and it is the specter of Iran . \nThe analogy everyone has in mind is 1979 , the fall of the stalwart American ally , the Shah of Iran , and its replacement with an Islamic Republic . \nThis fear comes from all over the political spectrum , though if you listen to some of the more conservative voices , you 'd think that Egypt is about to become the center of a new caliphate , spreading Islamic terror across the world . \nNow , there is some danger that events in Egypt could spill out of control , that nasty forces could come to power through the ballot and seize control of the state . \nBut Egypt has many elements within its state and within its society that will check the role of Islamic forces . \nThe Muslim Brotherhood , the leading Islamist party , is thought to have the support of about 25 percent of the population , and most of the other political groups in the country are secular . \nNow , the danger of some imagined future has blinded us to the present , and the problem in the present is military dictatorship . \nEgypt is not run by the Mubarak family , it is a military dictatorship . \nSince the officers ' coup of 1952 , all of Egypt 's presidents have come from the armed forces . \nThe county is ruled under martial law . \nMilitary courts trump civilian ones . \nMilitary leaders enjoy huge privileges and a fat budget in the current setup , and they will work very hard to preserve that position . \nIn fact , right now , what appears to be happening is a consolidation of military power . \nThe civilians and business leaders who are in the cabinet have been fired . \nThe new cabinet is 50 percent military . \nThe governors of Egypt 's provinces are now 80 percent military . \nThe military leadership has fought economic reforms because these reforms threaten the many industries which the army owns . \nIt has also opposed political reform because it fears losing its tight grip on power . \nAnd yet , as events unfold , it seems that while having decided to sacrifice Mubarak , the military intends to stay formally in power . \nBut what Egyptians out on the street are protesting is not just Mubarak personally , but the whole system , the military dictatorship . \nIf the United States is seen as having helped orchestrate a continuation of military rule under a democratic facade , we will deeply disappoint and frustrate the opposition in Egypt , which will inevitably turn more extreme and more religious . \nAnd then , some years hence , the Iranian scenario might well come to pass . \nYou can read much more about what I think about democracy in the region in my cover story in this week 's `` Time '' magazine , also online of course at Time.com . \nUp in just seconds , ElBaradei and Rachid Mohamed Rachid and then David Cameron . \nMohamed ElBaradei is one of the best known Egyptians on the world stage . \nHe 's a Nobel Laureate for his work as - at the world 's nuclear watch dog , the International Atomic Energy Agency . \nHe is now one of the leading voices of the Egyptian opposition . \nZAKARIA : You have been very clear that your demand as a leading figure of the opposition is that President Mubarak has to step down . \nBut Omar Suleiman , the vice president , has said unequivocally that the president is not going to step down . \nThe - President Obama 's representative , Frank Wisner , at a conference recently said the president must stay in office in order to steer changes through . \nIt appears that President Mubarak is going to stay . \nMOHAMED ELBARADEI , FORMER IAEA DIRECTOR : Well , I think , Fareed , this is - well , it 's continuing the standoff . \nI think the - the people are very clear that Mubarak has to retire in dignity , but he has to go . \nThere 's a huge question of credibility , Fareed , that Mubarak is a symbol of an outgoing regime and people have no credibility , that if he has n't - if he does n't leave , you know , the regime would retrench and then come back , you know , in - with vengeance . \nAnd you hear - you hear different - different voices . \nI mean , there you asked -LRB- ph -RRB- , it was very clear that he should go . \nFrank Wisner yesterday came with his statement , saying that Mubarak must stay , which created a lot of confusion , a lot of disappointment , I should tell you , here in Egypt . \nPeople were very happy with Barack Obama 's statements that - that the time for transition is now . \nMubarak would be , you know , stubborn but it 's not really a personal issue , it 's an issue of the future of the country and people want to see a new regime , and Mubarak to - to step down is a - is a clear indication that we are on the throes of - of the second republic , if you like . \nAnd unless he does that , we would continue the standoff , and I can tell you , people are very determined that he should leave . \nAnd also , Fareed , that the whole process of transition should not just be managed by the outgoing regime , by the - by his vice president , his prime minister . \nThey are all military people , but there have to be a heavy engagement by -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- people , by the - by the civilians . \nSo we are not in the greatest situation right now . \nIt 's a very opaque situation , and it 's a very tense situation , Fareed . \nZAKARIA : But what leverage do you have ? \nAt some point people have to go back to work . \nYou already get a sense that there is some degree of normalcy . \nThe protests are getting smaller . \nIs n't the regime hoping to outlast you ? \nELBARADEI : Well , I think yes . \nI think that 's part of the regime tactics . \nIt 's - it 's a war of frustration . \nWhen people do n't have enough , you know , basic of the - basic needs , enough to eat , they do n't have the daily wage , that they would then turn against the demonstrators and say enough is enough . \nLet us - let us go on with - with our daily lives . \nBut the basic problem , Fareed , as I see it , is it 's not just President Mubarak leaving office , it 's a question of credibility . \nWhile the - Omar Suleiman was talking about freeing all the detainees , all the young people that have been detained . \nI got nine people detained immediately after meeting with me at my - my home . \nHe - they - they were kept for a couple of days . \nThey were just released yesterday . \nSo there is - while you get also the feeling that we are - we are extracting a wisdom tooth , you know , they first come and say , we would change one -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- institution , then they get additional pressure . \nThen they would say that we 'll - we 'll do another . \nBut people do n't get the feeling that they are really buying into - into change , into democracy . \nI mean , we have n't heard anything , Fareed , about the ability to establish new parties really , the abolishing of martial law . \nSo a huge part of the problem is people , the young people in particular , do not have any sense of credibility , that these people mean what they say . \nZAKARIA : Is n't another tactic of - of the regime to try to divide the opposition ? \nAnd is it not succeeding ? \nThe Wafd Party has already engaged in negotiations with Suleiman . \nThe Muslim Brotherhood says that they will talk with him . \nAre you getting isolated , and is the opposition fracturing ? \nELBARADEI : Well , I 'm not - I 'm not - I do n't think I am isolated . \nI 'm one of - I 'm one of many , Fareed , who - particularly the people who are camping in - in the - in the Tahrir Square and many other parts of the Egypt . \nThey are determined that they would continue this week for -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- a week of resistance . \nAnd they will have a huge demonstration today , on Wednesday , on Friday . \nAnd so it is - it is a complete standoff , and I hope somebody will send the message , you know , I do n't know in which way , to President Mubarak that for the sake of the country , for - for his own dignity , to defuse the - this crisis , he better step down and everybody is ready to give him the dignified out he is entitled to as the former president of Egypt . \nBut - but he needs to go and you need to engage - you need to engage the civilians . \nYou need to - it should not be just the military . \nThe outgoing regime , running the process of change , people are not - are not believing that , and any feeling people will get , Fareed , that there is an effort to abort the - the revolution , the peaceful revolution , it would turn violent . \nZAKARIA : So you are saying under no circumstances , unless Mubarak resigns , will you negotiate with the regime ? \nELBARADEI : Well , I 'm ready to express my views , but I am not ready to negotiate with the representative of Mubarak . \nI mean , the whole idea was to - to move from that regime to a new regime . \nMubarak continues to be a symbol of that old regime , and I will not give any legitimacy to the existing regime because the whole idea is that this regime has no legitimacy , has no - has lost whatever credibility . \nAnd , yes , my - my position remains the same , Fareed , that I would not talk with these people until - until Mubarak - Mubarak steps down . \nZAKARIA : And what specifically happens then ? \nBecause a number of people have pointed out that under Egypt 's constitution then the speaker of the - takes over , not the vice president . \nYou have a national - presidential elections triggered in two months . \nDo you want all of that to happen ? \nOr how do you abort that process ? \nIf Mubarak is to resign , it sets in chain a set of transitions that many people say would be destabilizing . \nI - I think - I think what I 'm - I 'm calling for , Fareed , is a presidential council of three people , with Suleiman or somebody from the army would be one member . \nThe other should be civilian . \nA year of transition of a government of national unity , of a - of a - of caretaker government that 's prepared properly for a free and fair election . \nI think any election in the next coming of months before the right people to establish parties and engage , and it will be , again , a fake - a fake democracy . \nSo we need - we need a year of transition . \nWe need a government - a transitional government . \nWe need a presidential council . \nWe need to abolish the - the present constitution . \nWe need to dissolve the current parliament . \nThese are all instruments of the dictatorship regime , and we should not be - I do n't think we will go to democracy through that - the dictatorial constitution . \nI mean , my - my expert on constitutional law said the easiest way , Fareed , is to start a new era , with an interim constitution , set aside the present parliament , which is rigged , set aside the present constitution , which has nothing to do with democracy , and give our self a year for a peaceful and safe transition . \nAnd then we will get a proper president , a proper parliament and - and then work again a full fledged democratic constitution . \nThat 's the way I see it , Fareed . \nZAKARIA : Mohamed ElBaradei , a pleasure to have you on . \nThank you so much . \nZAKARIA : Up next , the latest live from Egypt , major protests in Cairo , Alexandria and more . \nZAKARIA : CNN 's Nic Robertson is live in Alexandria , Egypt this morning . \nNic , we 've been talking about this issue of dividing the opposition . \nYou 've spoken to people on the street who are talking about the very same thing . \nNIC ROBERTSON , CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : There 's a real frustration here , Fareed . \nThere 's a frustration at several levels . \nOne of those is that a lot of the young people we talked to feel that their great revolution , as they put it , is being usurped by political parties , Muslim Brotherhood and others , who 've been waiting in the wings to sort of ride this wave that they 've been able to build up . \nThey 're very frustrated about that and they do n't feel that they 're being properly represented at the moment . \nSome of the other political groups that we 're talking to on the streets here feel that what the government is trying to do as well at the moment is buy time - buy - sort of through political chicanery and hope that it can outmaneuver this great movement of protest , and they really feel that the government in its way of doing that is to divide them and conquer them . \nSo by appearing to give some concessions , they feel that the government is - is in effect trying to buy some of them off . \nAnd we 're actually seeing the effects of that on the streets , people saying , look , there 's been too much chaos now , the government has given us a little . \nThere will be elections . \nHe would n't stand again . \nThat should be enough . \nSo it 's those kinds of divisions that are now becoming - pulling some real anger on the streets here , Fareed . \nZAKARIA : A fascinating turn in the story . \nUp next , a former member of President Mubarak 's cabinet . \nWhat is going on in the corridors of power in Egypt ? \nZAKARIA : Rachid Mohamed Rachid was the first business leader ever in the Egyptian government . \nHe was one of the liberals , the so - called reformers . \nNine days ago , he lost his job when Mubarak fired the entire cabinet . \nEgyptian prosecutors have since banned him from traveling and frozen his assets . \nHe offers a rare insider 's look at the highest levels of the Egyptian government . \nZAKARIA : Do you think President Mubarak was deeply disappointed by the fact that President Obama has in the end asked for him to resign ? \nRACHID MOHAMED RACHID , FORMER EGYPTIAN TRADE MINISTER : Well , I - I can tell you now , not an official person , I can say almost whatever I want to say . \nI think the position of President Obama and the position of the American government was extremely short sighted . \nI do n't want even to say stupid . \nThere is so much interference . \nThey should n't actually have gotten involved in this . \nI think , at the end of the day , the record of the United States ' interference in many of these events in the past have showed how disastrous it end up to be . \nI think it is positive for the rest of the world to support Egypt in making the democratic transition , but I think it is not in the right of President Obama or the American government or any other government to dictate on Egypt what to do . \nZAKARIA : If Mubarak leaves , the - the military stays , the regime stays in power , the ones , you know , who oppose the reform stay in power . \nRACHID : Well , I personally believe that the best scenario for Egypt is for President Mubarak to stay , finish his term . \nI think what President Mubarak have said four days ago is a very - a clear and a very strong message for the transition . \nSince his speech , action have been taken on the ground . \nI believe that Egypt needs that transition . \nI believe that Mubarak can do that transition . \nI personally believe that he will push towards these changes to be done . \nAnd it 's not easy . \nWe all know it 's not easy , but I believe that the - the alternative is chaos and the alternative is just jumping into the unknown . \nAnd I believe that he has the will to do that . \nThere is a lot of people that have changed in the last few days . \nThere are so many faces that have been removed . \nWe - we have some promising faces , but we still , of course , have a lot of resistance . \nWe still have people who assume that things will go back to normal , but they will not . \nEgypt is a great country . \nIt has a great young population . \nIt has a great future and I think it is time now to let the future happen by the young people , not by history . \nZAKARIA : Why did you not join the government that was created about a week ago ? \nThe - the old government was fired , but you were invited to - to join - join the new one . \nYou chose not to . \nRACHID : Well , the reality , of course , was that we had to resign the old government on Saturday . \nOn Sunday , the new prime minister asked me , invited me to join the government . \nI personally felt that what is happening in Egypt now and the consequences of the events of the last few days will probably need a new direction . \nThe prime minister has his own views about what he would like to do . \nHe has a right to choose new faces . \nHe has a right maybe to change some of the policies . \nAnd that was the reason why I presented to him my apology , and he gracefully accepted that . \nBut even after that discussion , we had a lot of discussion about how to help him to set up the succession . \nBut I was very clear that what we are going to face in the next few weeks is going to be different from what we had in the past . \nZAKARIA : But then you face these prosecutors ' investigations . \nDo you have any sense as to - are these an attempt to in some way keep you quiet ? \nOr what do you think is - is behind these prosecutor 's charges ? \nRACHID : Well , I do n't know . \nI - I have all respect to our prosecutor , but I only know one thing , that if I was a minister in Egypt on Sunday or Monday morning , I would not have had that situation today . \nBut I believe that this thing will be cleared and I know that the general - the general prosecutor will be dealing fairly with all the issues here . \nZAKARIA : Do you worry about the people out on the streets ? \nDo you worry that they - this is - this is a Muslim Brotherhood movement that will take over the country and turn it into a kind of Islamic state ? \nRACHID : Well , we have many challenges . \nIt is - it is well known that there is , of course , a strong Muslim Brotherhood movement . \nWe are all aware what is the agenda that they have . \nBut I generally believe that what we have seen in the last 10 days have been initiated by the young people of Egypt , that we 're probably , as I said , were restricted despite the political reform that have been happening of having a voice and a share . \nThe system were not allowing them enough - although that we have made so many political changes in opening up , everybody knows that the Facebook have been really one of many important factors that made this happen . \nBut Facebook was an outcome of the political reform . \nEgypt have never restricted Internet . \nEgypt have opened up freedom of speech . \nI think we need to trust now in the young people of Egypt and we need to trust in that positive spirit that have been created . \nZAKARIA : You said a few days ago that these events have taken Egypt 's economy back 10 years . \nThat 's a pretty grim prognosis . \nDo you really think that it will take that long to get back to - to where you were ? \nRACHID : Well , Fareed , you know , I mean , business needs stability . \nBusiness needs clarity of direction and they need definitely a positive environment . \nToday , unfortunately , we do n't have any of those . \nI - I believe Egypt has a huge potential . \nWe have worked very hard in the last six years to develop the economy . \nMany , many people around the world have seen the proof that Egypt can deliver , and today the challenge is first to - to resume law and order . \nWe need to bring law and order back into the country . \nWe need to bring back security into the country . \nWe need to give the right messages to the business in terms of business environment , and that is probably one of the challenges now , especially when many - many business people are under attack . \nBut also , more important than that , we need also to prove that the transition will be smooth , and that 's why I believe President Mubarak is key to that . \nAnd we - we need to ensure the business community that at the end of this transition , Egypt will be a stable , democratic and economically business friendly society . \nZAKARIA : Rachid Mohamed Rachid , pleasure to have you on . \nRACHID : Thank you very much . \nZAKARIA : Next up , we 'll take you to Tahrir Square in Cairo , where demonstrators have vowed to stay until Mubarak leaves . \nZAKARIA : Demonstrators in Cairo are still out in force today . \nIvan Watson is in Cairo this morning . \nIvan , the mood appears to be more upbeat . \nBut you were telling me there were reports of growing concerns about the role of the military ? \nIVAN WATSON , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : That 's right . \nThe mood here is absolutely festive , Fareed , it 's - it 's really remarkable . \nWe had a show of solidarity between Christians and Muslims earlier of one of the main stages here , where men held up crosses and copies of the Koran at the same time in clasped hands . \nAnd that 's remarkable in a country where tensions exploded between Muslims and the Coptic Christian minority within the last month . \nWe have people who have been putting out calligraphy using the same stones that have been used for battle to protect this opposition , anti-Mubarak , pro-democracy -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- in recent days , using those stones to make street art instead . \nBut there are serious concerns here too about the role exactly of the military , the pro-Mubarak demonstrators who have been clashing here have - WATSON : -- seem to have withdrawn . \nInstead the demonstrators have directed themselves against the army . \nThey have built a human chain outside the barricades to prevent the Egyptian military , to prevent the tanks from being able to roll in and take down the barricades as generals have requested here in the past several days . \nAnd I asked them , you know , the army is supposed to be neutral here . \nYou frequently tell me that the army and people are one hand . \nThat 's a common catch phrase in Egypt . \nWell , the demonstrators say yes , but the army takes orders from President Mubarak and we do not trust him if he tries to open the way here , it will end our bubble or enclave here . \nAnd another sign of suspicion here , amid talk of dialogue and opening up the media and removing censorship here , I 've just heard word that Ayman Mohyeldin , a correspondent for Al-Jazeera English , has been detained by military intelligence , one of dozens who have been detained that way in recent days here - Fareed . \nZAKARIA : Fascinating reporting . \nThank you so much . \nBack in just a moment with the British Prime Minister David Cameron . \nZAKARIA : When Winston Churchill was prime minister , he famously said I have not become the king 's prime minister to preside over the liquidation of the British Empire . \nAre you the prime minister who will preside over the liquidation of Britain 's world role ? \nDAVID CAMERON , BRITISH PRIME MINISTER : I 'd like to take this opportunity , on a U.S. television station to say very clearly , Britain is maintaining its world role and Britain is an absolutely front ranked - front ranked player and will remain so . \nZAKARIA : Shortly after moving into 10 Downing Street less than a year ago , British Prime Minister David Cameron and his coalition government began a bold experiment . \nCameron 's government set out to prove that the way to dig Britain out of its economic problems was to slash budgets , cut spending , raise taxes . \nThat is , of course , in contrast to what is being done in the U.S. . \nSo will it save Britain ? \nRecent economic growth numbers have been bad . \nI sat down with British Prime Minister David Cameron last week in Davos to ask him about his efforts . \nCAMERON : Good to be here . \nZAKARIA : When Winston Churchill was prime minister , he famously said , I have not become the king 's first minister to preside over the liquidation of the British Empire . \nAre you the prime minister who will preside over the liquidation of Britain 's world role ? \nIf I look at your defense budget , it 's get - getting hollowed out . \nYour foreign policy budget is being cut . \nUnderstandably you have all these cuts . \nBut you would n't be able to do Afghanistan again . \nYou would n't be able to do Iraq again . \nYou would n't able to do the Falklands again if - CAMERON : I do n't - I do n't accept that for one single moment . \nAnd I 'd like to take this opportunity on a U.S. television station to say very clearly , Britain is maintaining its world role . \nWe 're actually maintaining it in cash terms . \nOur defense budget , 35 billion a year is maintained throughout this parliament . \nThat 's a small real terms cut . \nBut we will remain one of the five biggest spenders on defense anywhere in the world . \nWe have one of the best resource networks of embassies , ambassadors and the British Council anywhere in the world . \nWe have huge reserves of hard power and soft power . \nWe 're actually spending more in terms of combating cyber security problems , which I think is one of the growing threats in our world . \nWe have one of the most powerful and respected aid budgets in the world . \nAnd do n't underestimate that as a force for good and a force for change in the world . \nSo often the problems we 're confronting , whether it 's floods in Bangladesh or problems in Haiti , actually require aid as well as hard military power . \nSo Britain is a front ranked power where a member of every single one of the key organizations whether it 's the EU , whether it 's NATO and the Commonwealth , our relationship with America I believe is as strong as ever . \nAnd seven - actually , sorry - nine months into this job , I believe that relationship is at heart incredibly strong , not just because of what our forces do fighting and sometimes dying together , but also the security relationship where our assets and your assets work absolutely in harmony . \nThe information is shared . \nPresident Obama and I are on the telephone talking about the threats we face and how we 're going to combat them together . \nThe Britain is absolutely a front ranked - front ranked player and will remain so . \nAnd I would argue our defense review - that , yes , it took some difficult decisions and said there are some legacy assets that we do n't need . \nWe do n't need quite so many tanks when you 're not facing a Soviet Army that 's going to roll across Europe . \nIt 's right to make change . \nChange makes you stronger , more relevant and more powerful in the world , and that 's what we 've done . \nZAKARIA : Do you think the military tide is turning in Afghanistan ? \nCAMERON : I do think we 've made progress . \nI mean , one of the most important parts of that is in Helmand Province where we are , the hardest part . \nAnd remember , after America , we are the second largest contributor of troops in the toughest part of the country by a very , very long way . \nWe are making progress and that is , again , U.S. Marines and British Forces working together , far better balance of forces and much more the right number of forces and I think demonstrating that security is improving . \nBut the - the ticket for President Obama and for me to bring our troops home is the training of the Afghan Army and Police which is going well . \nWe need to keep that progress growing and we need a strong government in Afghanistan to help deliver that change . \nI believe those things can be done . \nAnd we will be able to do to , as I say , to meet our deadline of not having combat troops or troops -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- by 2015 . \nZAKARIA : George Soros says that the British economy is going to enter into a recession , that the contraction policies , the policies of taking money out of the economy by cutting spending , raising taxes that your government has done are going to have to be reversed . \nSoros has a pretty good track record of betting for and against governments . \nDoes it worry you that he feels this way ? \nCAMERON : I think we have an important task to carry out , which is to get the U.K. economy from recession through recovery and into growth . \nWe 're making good progress with that , but we ca n't ignore what is in front of us , which is , you know , the biggest budget deficit of any advanced country . \nAnd , you know , we 're borrowing more than 10 percent of our GDP this year . \nLike the rest of Europe , the ratio debt to GDP is growing very fast and you ca n't put that problem off . \nI want to say -LRB- ph -RRB- when you look at forecasts for the U.K. economy , including our own forecast , which is now totally independent of government , those forecasts are for continued growth . \nNow , obviously , we need to get behind that growth , help business cut regulation , make it easier to do business , all those things that we 're doing . \nBut really , part one , line one of any growth strategy in our situation has got to be dealing with the deficit , not putting it off . \nZAKARIA : But a number of economists say nobody questions that you needed to cut spending . \nThe question is when . \nAnd that you were not having any trouble raising money from the bond markets . \nI know the Britain was finding it easy to borrow and yet you preemptively made this decision . \nCould it be that it was too fast ? \nCAMERON : Well , I 'll make two points of that . \nFirst of all , if we go back to May when my government - coalition government came in , at that point actually people were suggesting that our credit rating could be downgraded . \nThere were potential problems of rises in market interest rates . \nAnd actually since we announced our deficit reduction plan , those market interest rates have actually come down and our credit rating has been reassured at AAA . \nSo I do n't accept that . \nThe second point I 'll make , is if you look at what our program actually is , it is about reducing the deficit , taking some steps as we did in 2010 , further steps in 2011 , more in 2012 . \nIt is a multiyear program . \nYou obviously ca n't get rid of a 10 percent budget deficit in one go . \nIt is a multi-year program and it 's accompanied by a government that is really looking at everything it can do to encourage growth . \nI 'm - I 'm convinced that 's the right answer . \nIt 's an answer we have to stick to and deliver . \nAnd it 's an answer that also has widespread support , and at least most recently from the OCD and the Bank of England , who say , look , this is a difficult task to engage in because you 've got to rebalance an economy that was , you know , the most indebted with the worse affected banks , the most indebted households , the biggest government deficit , you 've got to take that economy and rebalance it to be more dependent on exports and manufacturing and trade and a more balanced economy . \nSo it 's not an easy task and it will take time , but we 're doing it , I think , in the right way . \nZAKARIA : President Obama seems to be going in a different direction . \nIn his State of the Union , he laid out a plan for America , which stressed the importance of growth and growth through innovation and investments to get that growth in science and research and technology and infrastructure . \nAnd then he got to deficit reduction . \nDo you think he 's - he 's handling it wrong ? \nCAMERON : Well , again , I 'll make two points . \nFirst of all , America is different . \nI mean , America has a reserve currency . \nBritain is not in that situation . \nThe second point is that America is looking at reducing its deficit and obviously has to - to do that . \nI was just talking with Tim Geithner on the way to this interview and made exactly that point . \nSo there are differences but similarities . \nThe real similarities I would say is both countries recognize they have to clean up their banks and deal with that . \nThey have to pursue innovation , growth , make sure we 're investing in science . \nEven as we 're making cuts in Britain , we 're protecting the science budget . \nWe 're boosting the number or apprenticeships . \nWe 're cutting welfare roles so actually we can put money into transport , infrastructure and improving their productive capacity of the economy . \nSo even while we 're making cuts , we 're doing it in a way that supports growth . \nZAKARIA : Bob Diamond , the head of Barclays , says that the British government is still too tough on bankers that you are adopting a kind of a punitive attitude towards bankers and you - you need to give - to cut this out . \nWhat do you - CAMERON : Well , I would say we 're taking a common sense attitude . \nAnd , first of all , everyone involved in the banking industry has to understand the very real anger that still is amongst the public , that the banks were partly responsible for the mess that we are in . \nAnd when they see money that 's gone from the taxpayer into the banks going into large bonuses , that naturally makes people very angry . \nBut I 'll tell the common sense approach we 're taking is to say that I do not want to have an endless battle with banks and bankers when I 'm trying to get the economy to grow . \nLet us have a settlement where we actually see what we want to see in Britain . \nLet 's see the banks pay more in taxes and they will . \nLet 's see the banks do more in lending and they should and let 's see the bonus pools come down as I think they ought to . \nI think there is actually a settlement we can reach that says we 're going to stop this endless war of attrition , but it 's got to be done on the basis of banks being good , socially responsible citizens in our country , lending to the businesses that need the money , being responsible in terms of pay and making that contribution to the -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- . \nI 'm much more interested in the amount of tax the banks pay to help support the government , the economy and growth than I am in having sort of phony arguments about endlessly building up new tax regimes . \nZAKARIA : But it sounds like you do n't think the banks are yet doing what you want , which is curbing compensation and lending to businesses . \nCAMERON : Well , I think we 're making some progress . \nI mean , we 're having discussions with the banks in the U.K. . \nWe 're actually sitting around a table with the main clearing banks and talking with them about our ambitions on bank lending , particularly to small businesses about what we think needs to happen in terms of bonus pools , and also this issue of the total amount of tax the banks are going to pay . \nAnd I 'd say to people on the left in British politics who think the only answer is just keep hammering a new tax - bankers with a new tax . \nActually , if you look at the tax they 're paying this year , it will be more than last year and we 're looking at something like 120 billion of tax from the banks over this parliament . \nThat 's what I want to see it contributes - it 's the contribution they make that actually is going to be how I think we should judge whether we have a successful approach . \nZAKARIA : Back in a moment . \nMore with British Prime Minister David Cameron . \nI ask him about the royal wedding . \nZAKARIA : But you do n't have to approve the budget ? \nCAMERON : We 'll discuss these issues , but , I mean , they 're all family - CAMERON : I obviously have weekly meetings with the - with her Majesty , the Queen . \nThey are absolutely secret , so I would have to kill you if I told you anything we discussed . \nZAKARIA : We are back with more of my interview with British Prime Minister , David Cameron . \nZAKARIA : Is Britain prepared to play its part in rescuing Europe if you end up in the next few months and there 's likely to be bond auctions in a situation where the vulnerable countries from Greece , Ireland , Portugal , perhaps Spain need some kind of package of support ? \nGermany , of course , would be the critical country , but many people think Britain needs to step up as well . \nCAMERON : Well , first of all , I do n't want to speculate about other countries in Europe that are doing their best to deal with their problems . \nI mean , obviously , Britain is not a member of the Euro . \nI think we were right not to join and while I 'm prime minister we will not join . \nI think having our own currency and a more flexible monetary policy that can respond to our needs is right . \nClearly in the case of Ireland , they are an old friend and a very strong partner of the United Kingdom and it was right for us to make that bilateral loan to help them . \nWe are involved in one of the funds in Europe , the so-called financial mechanism , that was set up before I became prime minister . \nSo there 's a liability we have under that . \nIf we put the new financial arrangements put in place in Europe for the future do n't involve Britain and the arrangements will be put in place through a treaty change also do n't involve Britain , and that 's right because we 're not in the Euro , so we do n't have a say over the policy that is pursued in Portugal or in Spain or another countries . \nAnd so , I think , it 's right . \nIf you 're not in the Euro , you should n't have to make contributions to those funds in the future . \nAnd I think that 's a very clear , right way of going about things . \nZAKARIA : So you 're ruling out the prospect of Britain making contributions to rescue some of the European countries that need help . \nCAMERON : As I say , we already have a liability under the existing mechanism that was set up under that last government . \nCAMERON : But beyond that , I do n't believe if you 're not in the Euro , you should not be compelled to go to the aid of other countries when , you know , that might be connected to their membership of the Euro . \nI think it 's a pretty simple rule in life , if you 're not a member of a particular club , you do n't have the same liabilities to other members of that club . \nWe took a very clear decision . \nWe want the Euro to succeed . \nI would n't stand in the way of Euro action to help Euro members to sort out the problems they have because Britain will benefit from that . \nBut we chose not to go into the Euro for good reasons . \nI 'm glad we 're not in it . \nI think we have greater flexibility outside it to respond to the problems that we have right now in our economy . \nBut I want the Euro to succeed . \nThat 's why many of our exports go and I would n't stand in the way of the changes that they 'll need to make . \nZAKARIA : Prime Minister , you 're - you 're pushing this austerity measures on everyone . \nYou yourself , the Chancellor of the Exchequer , everyone is being very frugal . \nYou face an upcoming royal wedding . \nIs it going to be a budget wedding ? \nCAMERON : Well , it 's - no. . \nIt will be - it will be a royal wedding that the whole country can celebrate . \nObviously , the government will make its own contribution in terms of policing and security and the rest of it , but the royal family will be in charge of the plans . \nI think it will be - ZAKARIA : So you 're not paying for it ? \nCAMERON : Well , we pay for certain parts of it and the royal family pay for other - other parts . \nAnd I think it 's going to be great moment for Britain . \nThey are a wonderful couple . \nZAKARIA : But you do n't have approve the budget ? \nCAMERON : We 'll discuss these issues , but , I mean , the royal family - I obviously have weekly meetings with the - with Her Majesty , the Queen . \nThey are absolutely secret . \nSo I would have to kill you if I told you anything we discussed . \nBut I know it will be a huge success not just for the country and I think the world looking at Britain and how we have this wonderful royal family with this Prince William who I 've spent time with recently , is a remarkable young man , great balance , poise . \nI think he 'll make a - I 'm sure a fantastic husband and one day will make a wonderful king . \nI think the world will be looking at this royal wedding , but I think we 'll be very proud of it in the U.K. . \nBut above all , it 's two young people who love each other very much who are getting married and we should be happy for them . \nZAKARIA : Have you met the - have you seen the couple since they have announced their engagement ? \nCAMERON : Well , I spent some time with William in Zurich actually here in Switzerland when we were trying to bring the World Cup home for England . \nI 'm afraid we were as unsuccessful as the U.S. was in bringing the World Cup home for the U.S. . \nBut we spent some time together and talked about his plans . \nAnd it was great to hear , you know , when - when someone is getting married , their enthusiasm , their excitement . \nI could - I could very much feel that . \nZAKARIA : Did you give any words of advice as a - as a married man with some experience in this matter ? \nCAMERON : If I did , I certainly would n't tell you what it is . \nZAKARIA : Prime Minister , a pleasure to have you on . \nIf there 's one book you need to read to understand what 's going on in Egypt , it is `` Egypt After Mubarak : Liberalism , Islam , and Democracy in the Arab World '' by Bruce Rutherford . \nIt 's a great look at the political forces now at work in Egypt , the Mubarak regime , the opposition , both secular and Islamic . \nIt 's an academic book , but it 's very cleanly written . \nNow , a few of my final thoughts , the story in Egypt is moving into a fascinating phase . \nThe regime clearly recognizes that things will have to change , but it now wants to manage that change as carefully as it can . \nThe protesters see this but it 's not clear that they have the resources , organization or leadership to win . \nThe United States is , of course , watching this closely as are we . \nThanks to all of you for being part of my show this week . \nI will see you next week . \n"}

February 6th , 2011 11:14 am ET Current events in the middle east have become very clear . \nHere are a few details which will help you understand . \nOPEC is an oil cartel\\/monopoly which is run by 11 heads of state from the middle east . \nAmerican statesmen have declared that the price of oil is inflated because of this monopoly . \nThey think OPEC 's monopoly threatens Americas need for cheap oil . \nThey think if OPEC should be broken up -LRB- Lets say OPEC group A & OPEC group -RRB- then competition between rival OPEC A & B would drive down the price of oil . \nNext you must be aware that the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt has been set up and funded by Britain 's MI5 since the 1920s . \nThe Muslim Brotherhood were used by the British to revolt against President Nasser during the Suez crisis . \nThe Muslim Brotherhood are calling for revolution throughout the middle east . \nThis equates to Britain and her allies wanting revolution throughout the middle east . \nCouple this with Americans calling for the breakup of OPEC and it becomes clear that the plan by the west is to dismantle this area . \nFor example , if Saudi Arabia exploded into revolution it may split into North Saudi and South Saudi . \nWith all the middle east in revolution the 11 OPEC members could be split into 22 OPEC members . \nBut the 22 will be rivals , form separate groups and create competition in oil sales which will drive down the price . \nHowever the game cant end with a breakdown of OPEC . \nThe resulting cheap oil will also be available to China . \nFor America to control the cheap oil , it will need to keep the area in a state of constant chaos and on the edge of war . \nThis will create the excuse for America to deploy its military and pretend that its in the region to create peace . \nThe exchange for this calculated peace will be for the cheap oil to be directed to America . \nSome will argue that most of the dictators in the middle east are puppets installed by America and that the USA is already in control . \nThis is correct , but only to a certain level . \nMost of the American backed middle east dictators have become +30 year family dynasties . \nThey will follow America to a point . \nBut if the USA wants utter turmoil which can threaten the succession of the family dynasty , the dictators will defy the will of America . \ni.e. for Mubarak it was more important that his son takes power , obeying the USA had become a secondary priority . \nAmerica threw the stone of revolution in the middle east and tried hide its hand . \nThats why they started with claims of support for Mubarak . \nIt was not supposed to look like an American driven revolt . \nBut when Mubarak found a way to cling onto power , the Americans realized their plan may fail . \nHence the Americans started to announce Mubarak must go . \nThere is no confusion in America , only a fear that their plan may not work . \nAmerica hopes ElBaradei will take control of Egypt as he is their man and will follow the instructions needed to help break up OPEC and spread revolt . \nIsraelis will now find that for 60 years they have been sleeping with the American mafia . \nIt was fine for them as America -LRB- once the only super power -RRB- would back Israel in any crime or illegal occupation . \nIsraelis were laughing at the Arabs as the grabbed more and more land with American support . \nBut now America has a plan for middle east rebellion and instability to breakup OPEC . \nThe instability needs to last generations , so the USA can have its military there to ensure the USA gets all the oil it wants . \nWith this agenda , Mubarak and peace between Israel and Egypt is expendable . \nWith turmoil in the middle east both Muslim and Jew will die and suffer . \nIsrael is about to learn that when you sleep with the mafia you are expendable . \nNow some Israelis have a dream of a greater Israel which includes parts of Egypt , Jordan , Syria and Saudi Arabia . \nSome Israeli leaders may see the turmoil as a chance for more military victories and a chance to grab more land . \nThey will sell the idea of conflict on the Israelis as they believe it will be for the countries greater good . \nNevertheless , the price will be paid in Jewish and Muslim blood . \nMubarak has played some extremely difficult cards with brilliance . \nHe knows he has been betrayed by America and is probably buying time to establish better relations with Russia , China and Turkey . \nAll the other Arab dictators have also seen how America may betray them . \nSo do n't be surprised if China or Russia are invited to open naval or air bases in the middle east soon . \nAmerica has taken an enormous gamble which will be paid for by everyone in the middle east . \nMy guess is ; in the long term it will also accelerate the decline of American influence in the area . \nConclusion , Israel better get to the negotiating table quickly and offer something that can be considered reasonable and serious . \nGet as much regional agreement as possible while you still hold the upper hand . \nThe dynamics of the middle east are changing and you ca n't rely on the benefits of American mafia styled politics . \nAmerica can wait for Mubarak to leave in September . \nThe next opportunity for the USA to generate chaos now looks like it will be after he steps down . \nThe next vote will be crooked as always and the dissatisfaction of the people will again be whipped up into anarchy . \nFebruary 6th , 2011 4:45 pm ET p.s. Egyptian people have genuine concerns . \nMost of these concerns are based on the cost of living and limited chances to feed their families . \nThe IMF -LRB- largely run by USA & UK -RRB- instructed Egypt to cut food subsidies or face a reduced credit rating . \nIts called banking poor countries into submission . \nThey new Egyptian people would not be able to afford to eat and then they would blame the government . \nThe IMF was the political tool used to spark this crisis . \nThe the people of Jordan were then inspired by Egyptian protest and also start to protest themselves over their poor living conditions . \nAnd surprise surprise they have their gas cut off . \nAn act intended to increase dissatisfaction in Jordan . \nHow many more dirty tricks will we see in the Anglo American attempt to destabilize the middle east , cause revolt and breakup OPEC . \nPeople of the world from America to Jordan , from Egypt to Israel better start realizing they are all expendable pawns in the game played by our out of control governments -LRB- Goverments who serve the military industrial complex and banks , they dont serve you -RRB- . \nOn a closing note Liberty and human rights are not subjects for governments to meddle with . \nOn the other hand Democracy is two wolves and a sheep voting on whats for lunch . \nInstead of crowing about democracy in the world , we should be focusing on Liberty . \nThe founding fathers of America said , `` Give me Liberty or Give me death '' . \nThey did not ask for democracy , as democracy can be interpreted in so many different ways -LRB- As we have discovered via wiki leaks -RRB- . \nIf the West 's focus was on human liberty our politicians would be greatly limited in their ability to manipulate the lives of the people they were elected to serve . \nFebruary 7th , 2011 4:18 am ET Good Analysis . \nWe need more about Mahdi coming and Jesus coming to face the anti christ and the armagadon . \nThe MI5 is a British domestic counter-terrorism force . \nThey would have had little role in Egypt of the 1920s . \nIf the British had any role in supporting the creation of the Muslim Brotherhood it may have been their interest in the social institutions they were setting up in British controlled Egypt but , as has been proven many times , this was only one element in their agenda . \nIt is rediculous to suggest that while the British were trying to prevent German infiltration in the 1930s they would be supporting the Brotherhood who were working with the Nazis to defeat the British . \nAlthough doubtless there have always been British Arabists who would do anything to promote the Arab cause even to the detriment of their own nation . \nYour comments are little more than anti-Western conspiracy and propaganda . \nMiriam , you are so sweet and simple in mind . \nThe Egyptians did n't like it . \nSo Britain created a radical group to convince the people anarchy would replace Britain . \nDoes that sound familiar to you . \nBut in your sweet simple world there are no spies or dirty tricks . \nIn fact the thought of a country manipulating information is a wild conspiracy theory . \nDo n't you think its time to grow up . \nThe real world does n't guarantee a Walt Disney happy ever after . \nWhere do you get your facts from ? \nThey are not supported by anything to be found on the internet . \nDo you have a secret library of sources only available to you ? \nI have covered a lot of issues . \nName the ones you would like more information on and I will point you to the sources . \nIn fact you will find them on the web if you try a little harder with your research . \nBut be warned , if you can support facts on this web site , some will try to say its just cut and paste . \nIf you do n't offer sources of information , others will say the sources do n't exist . \nMeanwhile most people just type in blogs that have no thinking behind them at all . \nI love your analysis becuase they align with my thinking about America and her allieds , particularly when it comes to political and economic interest . \nBut they often forget that what goes around comes around . \nI think the solution to these problems confronting humanity is to form a universal government where all humans are giving equal liberty . \nMeaning that the more we tolerate geographical barrier , entry visa , racial distinction , all sorts of political associations etc. the more humanity sinks into these problems . \nThe Arabs were not the only ones trying to negotiate with the Nazis . \n`` As late as 1941 , the Zionist group LEHI , one of whose leaders , Yitzhak Shamir , was later to become a prime minister of Israel , approached the Nazis , using the name of its parent organization , the Irgun -LRB- NMO -RRB- ... -LRB- The proposal stated : -RRB- ` The establishment of the historical Jewish state on a national and totalitarian Pd bound by a treaty with the German Reich would be in the interests of strengthening the future German nation of power in the Near East ... The NMO in Palestine offers to take an active part in the war on Germany 's side ' ... The Nazis rejected this proposal for an alliance because , it is reported , they considered LEHI 's military power ` negligible . ' \nAllan Brownfield in `` The Washington Report on Middle Eastern Affairs '' , July\\/August 1998 . \nFebruary 9th , 2011 11:38 am ET Izma says , `` the solution to these problems confronting humanity is to form a universal government '' A universal government means one leader for all the world . \nThis is in fact a definition for dictatorship . \nBe very careful for what you wish for . \nIn my opinion the real solution is less government , more law which protects human rights and the let people manage their own lives . \nPeople manage their lives better than government . \nWhat governemnt actually is popular and successfull ? \nSad answer : non . \nSo lets drop the global goverment idea which is more or less the meaning behind the story 1984 . \nWhat you fail to mention in your regurgitated anti-Israel propaganda is that the Lehi , a group with no single political , religious or economic ideology whose members ranged from the far-right to the far-left before and after the re-establishment of the Jewish state , was unpopular within the Jewish population and rejected by the Jewish leadership for its terrorist activities . \nMany members had served with the British against the Nazis at the start of WW2 but with the British Mandate anti-immigration policy which left thousands of Jewish refugees fleeing Europe having to return straight back to extermination camps , some became staunchly anti-British and anti-imperialist . \nA wild , and for obvious reasons , unpopular proposal sent to the Nazi party suggested that they could solve their `` problem '' with the presence of Jews in Europe by allowing their emigration to a Jewish state . \nAt the same time , they would continue with their shared aim of defeating the British . \nClaiming that the British established the Brotherhood is as stupid as suggesting that the British created the Lehi , that is , excluding the reactionary contribution . \nBut then again , some of the conspiracies we read here are that stupid . \nThe proposal by Shamir is not a conspiracy theory but a fact and people were so outraged that they elected him PM of Israel . \nThe spin you have tried to put on facts of history is just so much BS . . \nAs we say '' this dog wo n't hunt '' . \nFebruary 11th , 2011 8:38 pm ET Do n't think America is behind this at all ! \nThis was all precipitated by the backwards economic programs in all these Arab nations , run by Monarchs or Totalitarian leaders . \nThe spark that set it off was a Tunisian setting himself on fire over the problems in Tunisia , and Egyptians responded that they were all suffering from the same thing . \nAll over the Arab\\/Muslim world , including Iran , the problems are the same . \nThe rest of the world is progressing faster and these people were being left behind , largely because of the ineptitude of their leadership . \nRevolution is the hardest thing until it is done , now the hardest thing will be establishing a new order , one that actually fulfills some of the people 's aspirations . \nThere is no reason Egypt 's people ca n't be productive or modern as anywhere , but it will take time to achieve that and in the meantime they have to worry about feeding themselves . \nAll they have done is gotten rid of a bad leader , that does n't mean they do n't have real problems that need to be addressed before things get better . \nAre n't the people in Egypt going through what America did in gaining it 's independence ? \nUltimately political power lies with the people , if the Army wo n't fire on them , then their will is more likely to come into being . \nThey need a full overhaul of their government , their constitution and their policies . \nMany regions of the world which were once colonized have eventually emerged with a hope to rule themselves . \nWe have many examples from Africa and South America . \nUnfortunately all newly liberated countries soon wake up to reality . \nTheir history included occupation by a foreign military . \nThis is quickly replaced with stealth colonialism controlled by banks . \nNo country is free through the word `` democracy '' . \nFreedom is built via fair trade and resultant financial stability . \nFreedom also requires laws to protect human rights . \nThe post colonial powers and America have always spoken with hypocrisy . \nThey claim they want a democratic and prosperous world and then use their established power to ensure the people of developing regions can not compete within a fair market place . \nBesides if Egypt freely and democratically elects a government which calls American & Israeli corruption to account , we know western media will declare Egypt to be a hostile Islamic state . \nThis in itself will be hypocritical , because in America its okay to have a Jewish state , but its wrong to have an Islamic state . \nEgypt is far from being free , but its suppressors are not all within Egypt . \nOne good thing I noticed is that all Egyptians interviewed on the street are aware of American hypocrisy . \nAs one said so well after Obama 's latest speech , `` We started this revolution without the help of America and we will end it without the help of America '' . \nNeedless to say America now busily does all it can to ensure Egyptians choose a leader wanted by the Whitehouse . \nNow if we really care about democracy , we should do everything possible to ensure that the Egyptians choose who they want and the world community supports their choice without economically pressuring them into a leadership the west prefers . \nWho called it a conspiracy theory ? \nYou are correct it is a fact but over exaggerate it 's significance . \nNot only did almost all the Jewish leadership reject the proposal including other Lehi members , the Nazis rejected it primarily because it contradicted their objectives in collaborating with Arab leaders . \nWRT Shamir 's election to PM , as is common in virtually all societies , those who fought for independence are often elected as political leaders although in Israel 's case , they were given many years to prove that their militant activities had been well and truly abandoned . \nThis is was you wrote : `` some of the conspiracies we read here are that stupid . '' \nAt least get right it right . \nEnough already with your BS ! \nConspiracy in relation to the Brotherhood being created by MI5 . \nYou do n't need to twist my words . \nyou are the BSter , you have no idea about facts , you lie , falsify history and support the jew hating antisemite john cut-and-paste A February 20th , 2011 10:56 am ET Proud Zionist has escaped from his nurses again . \nIf any one has seen Proud Zionist , please be kind enough to let Herzog Hospital know where he is . \nWith thanks to all the tireless staff who take care of him . \nWhere can I read more posts about this ? \nJanuary 22nd , 2012 11:25 am ET Hi , satisfyingly area , i muse on hither something correspond to to this chair but i do n't procure anytime second , but seriously it 's utter careful Comments are moderated by CNN , in accordance with the CNN Comment Policy , and may not appear on this blog until they have been reviewed and deemed appropriate for posting . \nAlso , due to the volume of comments we receive , not all comments will be posted . \nWelcome to the Inside the Middle East blog where CNN 's journalists post news , views and video from across the region . \nThis is also a place where you can start the discussion so please keep your comments coming . \nWe highlight not only current news stories but also anecdotes and issues that do n't always make the top of the headlines . \nInside the Middle East airs the first week of every month on the following days and times : \n"}
