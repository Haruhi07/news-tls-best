By Harry Hamburg -- Associated Press -RRB-
Christopher J. Dodd -LRB-
D - Conn .
-RRB- , chairman of the Senate Banking Committee , <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2009-06-11">yesterday</TIMEX3> announced his support for the creation of a new agency with broad authority to protect consumers of financial products such as mortgage loans and credit cards .
The Obama administration plans to propose such an agency <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2009-W25">next week</TIMEX3> as a key piece of its agenda for the reform of financial regulations .
Dodd , whose committee will play a crucial role in legislating those reforms , had reserved judgment until <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> .
The new office would strip away a major part of the responsibilities of the federal agencies that regulate banks , particularly the Federal Reserve .
Consumer advocates and many members of Congress have said the Fed 's failure to enforce existing laws was a key cause of the financial crisis because firms could sell products that consumers could not afford .
For example , the Fed waited until <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2008-SU">last summer</TIMEX3> to restrict mortgage - lending practices such as penalizing borrowers for attempting to refinance loans before an interest - rate adjustment and issuing loans without verifying the borrower 's income .
By then , defaults on millions of loans issued on those terms already were contributing to a meltdown of financial markets .
` ` The economic mess we 're in is rooted in a spectacular failure of consumer protection , '' Dodd said in a statement .
The statement added that the Fed ` ` failed for <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P14Y" mod="MORE_THAN">over 14 years</TIMEX3> to put an end to the predatory mortgage lending practices that led to the financial crisis . ''
The Fed declined to comment .
But regulators and industry representatives have quietly started to make the case that a new agency would be even less effective at protecting consumers and that strengthening the role of the existing agencies is a better approach .
