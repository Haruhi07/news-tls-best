Regarding the <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2008-09-17">Sept. 17</TIMEX3> front - page article on the government bailout of American International Group -LRB- AIG -RRB- , which was published <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> after the op - ed column ` ` No More Creampuffs , '' about the government being willing to let large firms fail : It seems to me that the market is not really free if oil companies get huge tax breaks and financial institutions such as Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac and AIG know that the federal government will bail them out when they make stupid decisions .
When the tenor of the federal government is to support and protect big business at the expense of efficiency , the environment , ordinary citizens and international relations , the ` ` free market '' is not operating as it should .
Why are all the economic geniuses shocked at the collapse of Lehman Brothers -LRB- front page , <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2008-09-15">Sept. 15</TIMEX3> -RRB- ?
Why should anyone be surprised at bank failures , given the banks ' investments in subprime mortgages <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="PXY" mod="MORE_THAN">over the past several years</TIMEX3> ?
Their encouragement of rising housing prices made inflated values seem legitimate .
Anyone with a brain knew that homes could n't be worth what the real estate agents and the mortgage lenders said they were worth .
We just liked pretending that we were all millionaires because some assessment said so .
So why do the financial pundits seem surprised ?
Is it their fear about the economy or the realization that they 're no smarter than the rest of us ?
