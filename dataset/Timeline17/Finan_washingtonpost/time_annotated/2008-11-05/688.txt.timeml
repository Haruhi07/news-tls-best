Benjamin B. Lacy and his wife Debra sipped beer and munched on beef carpaccio <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">a few weeks ago</TIMEX3> in Munich at a commercial real estate gathering .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent years</TIMEX3> , the Lacys have advised Germans to invest about $ 1 billion in office buildings , helping pump up the regional market .
` ` Everybody showed up and we had nice dinners and drank lots of good beer , '' he said .
` ` But underneath was a fear of doom and gloom .
We were talking up deals but the undercurrent was , ` What is going on in the U.S. ? ' ''
For the Lacys , who run a real estate investment and advisory firm , it was another stark signal that the global financial crisis is hitting the commercial market .
With few lenders doling out money these days , commercial real estate sales -- including office , mall and warehouse properties -- are expected to be less than half of <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2007">last year</TIMEX3> 's record - setting $ 514 billion , according to Real Capital Analytics of New York .
More than $ 14.5 billion in deals have been canceled or pulled away from <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2008">this year</TIMEX3> , including about $ 1 billion in the Washington region , according to Cassidy & Pinkard Colliers .
In addition , growing layoffs and falling profits mean companies are giving up office space at rapid rates .
Nationwide , more than 19 million square feet of space -- enough to fill more than 300 football fields -- has been emptied by office users <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2008">this year</TIMEX3> , the most since the months after the <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2001-09-11">Sept. 11 , 2001</TIMEX3> , attacks .
Locally , about 1 million square feet of office space is dark and empty , according to Reis Inc. , a New York - based real estate research firm .
PriceWaterhouseCoopers and the Urban Land Institute concluded in a <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> released report that ` ` U.S. commercial real estate faces its worst year since the wrenching <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="1991">1991</TIMEX3> - <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="1992">1992</TIMEX3> industry depression . ''
Analysts say that nationwide , rents are stagnant and will probably drop .
Vacancy rates at offices , shopping malls and hotels are expected to rise , and billions of dollars of loans are coming due <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2009">next year</TIMEX3> .
` ` This is a record - setter because it transcends real estate , '' said John Germano , managing director of the mid - Atlantic region for CB Richard Ellis , one of the country 's largest commercial real estate firms .
` ` You ' ve seen companies that real estate depends on like Merrill Lynch , Lehman either be retrenched , sold or go under . ''
Things will get worse if unemployment rises nationwide and consumers continue to cut back on spending , according to analysts .
Stores and businesses would lease less space , probably resulting in a glut of office space and lower rents .
` ` We have n't had the second shoe drop , '' said Dan Fasulo , a managing director at Real Capital Analytics , the real estate research company .
` ` You 're going to see more tenants closing up shop . ''
` ` If we get pushed into a recession , all bets are off .
This is affecting everybody , '' he said .
There are a few large , blue - chip projects around the country that are having troubles -- a sign that has brokers , developers and lenders in the industry worried that even deals in good , solid locations with established developers behind them are at risk .
