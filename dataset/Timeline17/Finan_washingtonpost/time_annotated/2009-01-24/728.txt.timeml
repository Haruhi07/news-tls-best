Prescient Young Blogger Did What S. Korea Could n't -- Foresee Global Financial Crisis As a financial blogger named Minerva , Park Dae - sung was the dark prophet of market decline in South Korea .
In this education - obsessed country , where academic credentials are often taken as a measure of human value , he was also something of an idiot savant .
He had no degree in economics .
He had no professional experience in finance .
He was not a wealthy investor .
He had been a so - so student who studied communications at a so - so junior college in a backwater town south of Seoul .
Thirty - one years old and single , he spent much of his time alone in his room .
As his father noted , ` ` He ca n't even get a job . ''
But he knew a global economic smack - down when he saw one .
Minerva saw it coming <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2008-FA">last fall</TIMEX3> , far earlier and with far more acuity than the South Korean government , which his blog has humiliated and angered .
Besides getting mad , the government got even .
In a move widely perceived by the public as a chilling echo of <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="197">the 1970s</TIMEX3> , when a military dictatorship ruled South Korea , the government detained Park <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2009-01">this month</TIMEX3> , invoking a seldom - used telecommunications law that charges him with harming the public by spreading ` ` false rumors . ''
Yet Minerva -LRB-
no one knew him as Park until police raided his house <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2009-01-07">Jan. 7</TIMEX3> -RRB- made his reputation by spreading rumors that turned out to be all too true .
He predicted the collapse of Lehman Brothers <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P5D">five days</TIMEX3> before it happened .
He predicted a sharp decline in the value of South Korea 's currency <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="PXD">a few days</TIMEX3> before the won imploded against the dollar .
By the time he was taken away from his computer in handcuffs , he was a cyber - sensation .
His blog had garnered more than 40 million page views -LRB- there are 48 million people in this well - wired country -RRB- .
He was lionized in the South Korean news media as the ` ` online oracle '' and the ` ` Internet president of the economy . ''
Although Park has told authorities he is Minerva , claims have emerged here that Minerva might be a few people .
Several economic and financial experts have said they wrote online postings under the name .
Prosecutors , though , have declined to investigate , saying they have irrefutable electronic evidence that Minerva is Park .
