Former Chair of the President 's Economic Recovery Advisory Board -LRB- <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2009-01">January 2009</TIMEX3> - <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2011-01">January 2011</TIMEX3>
-RRB- Volcker brought instant credibility to President Barack Obama 's <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> presidential campaign .
His weighty experience helped dispel the notion that Obama lacked the economic credentials to become chief executive during the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression .
While he is not taking a full - time job in the administration , as chairman of an economic advisory committee , he will be a critical voice as Obama tries to forge a path out of the recession .
Volcker left the committee in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2011-01">January 2011</TIMEX3> and was replaced by GE Chairman Jeffrey Immelt .
In a pivotal moment in the final <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> presidential debate , Sen. John McCain -LRB- R - Ariz .
-RRB- questioned the associates of the junior senator from Illinois , a persistent campaign theme . ''
` Let me tell you who I associate with , ' Obama told McCain .
` On economic policy , I associate with Warren Buffett and former Fed chairman Paul Volcker . ' ''
Volcker has a reputation for fairness and strong leadership during troubled times .
When he became chairman of the Federal Reserve in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="1979">1979</TIMEX3> , he faced the worst inflationary crisis America had seen in decades .
He ended it by raising interest rates sharply , sparking the deepest downturn since the Great Depression .
The interest - rate hikes are <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> widely viewed as a necessary step to end the cycle of soaring prices and stagflation that set in , but at the time the tactic was deeply controversial , as the unemployment rate climbed above 10 percent .
Since being replaced by Alan Greenspan in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="1987">1987</TIMEX3> , Volcker has become an eminence grise , lending independent credibility to a range of organizations .
For example , he investigated alleged corruption in the United Nations Oil for Food Program in Iraq .
He is also chairman of the Group of 30 , an assemblage of leading financial experts that seeks an overhaul of global financial regulations .
In his later years , he 's still helping to shape the nation 's future economic policies , and was even discussed as an Obama Treasury secretary .
Though he has taken an advisery position rather than a full - time job , ` ` When the team discusses the financial crisis , ` The most important question to Obama : What does Paul Volcker think ? '
says Jason Furman , the <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> campaign 's economic - policy director . ''
Career History :
Chairman , Federal Reserve -LRB- <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="1979">1979</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="1987">1987</TIMEX3> -RRB- ; Undersecretary for Monetary Affairs , Department of the Treasury -LRB- <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="1969">1969</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="1974">1974</TIMEX3> -RRB- ; Deputy Undersecretary for Monetary Affairs , Department of the Treasury -LRB- <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="1963">1963</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="1965">1965</TIMEX3> -RRB-
Alma Mater : Princeton University , BA , <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="1949">1949</TIMEX3> ; Harvard University , MPA , <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="1951">1951</TIMEX3> Raised in Teaneck , N.J. , Volcker learned from an early age how government affects people .
He learned this from his father , who worked as a city manager for the Jersey town , and even helped it escape a small financial crisis of its own .
Volcker went to Princeton University , graduating summa cum laude before moving to Harvard to earn a master 's in public administration .
The 6 - foot-7 - inch student found himself leaning towards work in government even back then .
` ` When I was in college and graduate school , at institutions thought to be among the elite , a career in the foreign service or in one of the great domestic departments and agencies was considered by many a natural professional objective , a means by which those able and interested in government expect over time to gain satisfaction and ultimately a reasonable measure of prestige from constructive public service , '' he said .
While at Harvard , Volcker interned as a research assistant at the New York Fed .
He stayed with the Fed after he graduated in <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="1952">1952</TIMEX3> , and worked his way up to special assistant in the securities department .
He then moved to Chase Manhattan Bank as a financial economist .
By <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="1962">1962</TIMEX3> , Volker was back in the public sector , working at the Treasury Department .
He would return to the private sector for a few more years , but in <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="1969">1969</TIMEX3> became undersecretary to the Treasury for monetary affairs .
After a brief stint as a professor at Princeton , President Carter named Volcker Fed Chairman in <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="1979">1979</TIMEX3> .
Volcker 's first meeting with Obama came in <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="2007-06">June 2007</TIMEX3> , when Obama was seen as a longshot to win the presidency .
Volcker walked away from a dinner with the upstart Democrat , saying he was ` genuinely impressed . '

But no one in Obama 's campaign thought of asking for Volcker 's help .
When Obama economic adviser Austan Goolsbee discovered Volcker 's comment , he quickly urged the team to get Volcker involved .
` ` Paul Volcker is a legend !
We do n't want to use his contacts for money , we want to pick his brain , '' Goolsbee said .
Obama was soon speaking to him regularly for counsel on responding to the burgeoning crisis .
Obama 's proclamation in <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="2007-09">September 2007</TIMEX3> that the housing market downturn could cause a ` crisis in confidence ' in the financial markets originated with Volcker .
Volcker at first disagreed with the notion that the U.S. needed an economic stimulus package , but <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> events changed his mind . ''
I ' ve gone through a number of crises , but I ' ve never seen one more complicated or difficult , '' he said .
Volcker expressed some public skepticism of the Federal Reserve 's decision to put $ 29 billion at risk to arrange the sale of investment bank Bear Stearns in <TIMEX3 tid="t37" type="DATE" value="2008-03">March 2008</TIMEX3> .
In an <TIMEX3 tid="t39" type="DATE" value="2008-04">April</TIMEX3> speech , Volcker said that the Fed took actions that ` ` extend to the very edge of its lawful and implied powers , transcending in the process certain long - embedded central banking principles and practices . ''
In <TIMEX3 tid="t42" type="DATE" value="2009-01">January 2009</TIMEX3> , Obama proposed new financial regulations that would attempt to prevent a future economic downturn while also solving the ` ` too - big - to - fail '' problem , which forced the government to interve and save collapsing banks .
The new rule outlined would limit banks ' ability to invest in hedge funds and private equity funds .
If approved by Congress , the rule would revive parts of the Glass - Steagall Act , repealed in <TIMEX3 tid="t43" type="DATE" value="1999">1999</TIMEX3> , which separated corporate banks from investment banks .
Dubbed the ` ` Volcker Rule , '' Obama 's proposal attempts to bring back similar limitations .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t46" type="DATE" value="2009-01">January 2009</TIMEX3> , the Group of 30 economists and finance experts , chaired by Volcker , issued a report on a global financial regulatory overhaul .
Among other steps , it called for preventing any one financial institution from becoming so large that its failure could bring down the entire financial system .
It also calls for money - market mutual funds , which are similar to banks in many ways but are far less regulated , to be overseen more carefully .

And the report calls on the U.S. government to clarify the legal status of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the government - sponsored housing finance companies that it took over in <TIMEX3 tid="t47" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> but whose relationship with the government has historically been ambiguous .
Because of Volcker 's closeness to Obama , it is widely believed that many of the ideas in the report will be embraced by the new administration .
Volcker has been around Washington since <TIMEX3 tid="t48" type="DATE" value="195">the 1950s</TIMEX3> and has amassed an historic reputation .
Although shy , he has built a career that had direct dealings with Presidents Carter and Reagan .
He went on fishing trips with Gerald Corrigan , ex - CEO of the Federal Reserve and managing director at Goldman Sachs .
