Hedge funds seemed unstoppable during the boom years , lavishing riches upon their investors and managers alike .
<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> that those riches are quickly disappearing , some analysts are blaming them for propagating the high - risk culture that led to the crisis on Wall Street .
We try to shed some light on the hedge fund industry .
Q : What are hedge funds and how do they operate ?

A : They are private investment funds open to a limited number of people or institutions that can afford to invest a minimum amount of money .
Think of them as mutual funds for the wealthy .
But unlike mutual funds , they do n't have to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission because they are not sold to the public .
That means they can sell short , leverage , and undertake all sorts of complicated trading strategies .
They are also run by managers who typically get paid higher fees and get a bigger take of profits than other types of fund managers .
` ` What they really should be called are unregistered funds for wealthy people , '' said John Rekenthaler , vice president of research for Morningstar .
They were named hedge funds because they were supposed do just that : hedge their investments through a variety of methods such as taking both long and short positions .
But in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent years</TIMEX3> , many hedge funds have been doing less hedging and actually adopting riskier practices to maximize rewards .
Specifically , some have been leveraging themselves excessively -- investing with borrowed money .
` ` As we know , leverage increases returns but it does the same thing in reverse , maybe faster , '' said Duncan Balsbaugh , a senior market analyst for Thomson Reuters , IFR Markets .
Q : Why do hedge funds matter so much ?

A : Even though the hedge fund industry is n't as massive as the mutual fund industry , it still packs a big punch because each hedge fund operates with such a large sum of money .
According to Chicago - based Hedge Fund Research , capital in global hedge funds was $ 1.72 trillion at <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2008-09" mod="END">the end of September</TIMEX3> -LRB-
that was down from $ 1.93 trillion at <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2008-06" mod="END">the end of June</TIMEX3> -RRB- .
So when one hedge fund pulls money out of the market , it tends to be a big chunk .
Their moves also tend to be made with dramatic flair .
` ` They 're active traders compared to mutual funds , '' Rekenthaler said .
` ` They can have a larger influence regardless of their size because they trade more aggressively . ''
Q : What is their role in the market turmoil going on <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> ?

A : Hedge funds made risky bets and like many other investors , they are paying for it .
Spooked investors are responding by pulling out their money .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2008-Q3">the third quarter of 2008</TIMEX3> , they withdrew $ 31 billion , according to HFR .
The funds have to find cash to meet these so - called redemption requests .
They do so by selling their assets .
<TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Right now</TIMEX3> , they are doing just that , which is contributing to the stock market volatility .
` ` They 're moving from an aggressive stance to a conservative stance , selling securities and knocking down the price of those securities , '' Rekenthaler said .
Q : How much are they to blame for the global financial crisis ?

A : It 's hard to say because they operate under a veil of secrecy .
` ` The problem is nobody knows for sure how much money they hold and where their money is invested and how significantly they 're leveraged , '' said Jeff Fischer , lead adviser for Motley Fool .
But they are not the only ones selling stocks .
Many panicked investors , big and small , are following suit .
Many analysts also said it would be unfair to single out hedge funds for doing risky things such as overleveraging themselves .
Those <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> - defunct investment banks and other financial institutions are guilty as well .
That said , they could probably use more oversight , said John Jacquemin , chief executive of Mooring Financial Corp. , which has a hedge fund .
` ` It 's the Wild West out there , '' he said . ''
