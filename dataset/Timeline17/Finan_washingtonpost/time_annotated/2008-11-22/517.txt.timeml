A defiant Citigroup proclaimed itself in good health <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2008-11-21">yesterday</TIMEX3> even as its stock price completed a one - week , 60 percent swan dive , highlighting renewed investor concern about the long - term prospects of the nation 's largest banks .
Lenders are facing massive losses across a wide range of businesses as the economy unravels at a quickening pace , and investors have concluded that some of the largest banks , including Citigroup , will need to raise more money .
Some investors also appear to be betting that the Bush administration is out of time , tools and willpower to save another bank .
Simon Johnson , former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund , compared the market movement to an attempt by speculators to collapse a foreign currency by betting that the government wo n't invest enough money to reverse the decline .
` ` The market is testing Mr. Paulson , '' said Johnson , <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> a professor of entrepreneurship at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
` ` They basically have $ 60 billion left to last them <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P2M">two months</TIMEX3> , and <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> they have to deal with some increasingly serious problems . ''
Citigroup 's executives launched a fierce campaign <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2008-11-21">yesterday</TIMEX3> to convince investors and analysts , government officials , and even their own employees that the company is in a strong position to weather the economic crisis .
Chief executive Vikram Pandit accused investors of ` ` fear - mongering , '' according to a person who heard him speak on a conference call with employees <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2008-11-21">yesterday</TIMEX3> .
Federal regulators are watching the situation and are in contact with the company 's executives but are not taking an active role , believing that Citigroup is in much stronger financial condition than banks that have <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> collapsed , people familiar with the matter said .
The government remains committed to preventing the collapse of any large financial institution , those sources said , speaking on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly .
Citigroup 's board met <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2008-11-21">yesterday</TIMEX3> to discuss options , including the sale of business units , according to people familiar with the situation .
Pandit has said that he strongly opposes the sale of core units such as the Smith Barney brokerage .
Citigroup is also pushing the Securities and Exchange Commission to suspend short - selling , the practice of betting on a decline in a company 's stock price , which can create its own momentum as investors drive down prices , according to industry and government sources .
The company has the support of leading industry trade groups , but two industry sources who had been in contact with the SEC about the matter said regulators are disinclined to comply .
The SEC banned short - selling on hundreds of financial stocks for <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">several weeks earlier this fall</TIMEX3> .
But the agency concluded the initial effort was counterproductive , because it led some large investors to sell all their holdings and leave the market , undermining the stated purpose of shoring up stock prices .
Investors dropped Citigroup 's stock to $ 3.77 a share in trading <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2008-11-21">yesterday</TIMEX3> on the New York Stock Exchange , the lowest price since <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="1992">1992</TIMEX3> .
Bank of America fell to $ 11.47 , its lowest share price since <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="1995">1995</TIMEX3> .
J.P. Morgan Chase fell to $ 22.72 , its lowest price since <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2002">2002</TIMEX3> .
Citigroup 's stock price has little direct , short - term impact on the company .
The concern , however , is that Citigroup 's customers and business partners will accept the stock market 's judgment about the company 's health and will begin to withdraw and withhold money from the bank .
A similar process has driven other banks to the point of collapse , including Washington Mutual , Wachovia and National City .

The declining stock price also limits the company 's ability to raise money by issuing shares , or to buy other companies using shares .
Citigroup had discussed buying Chevy Chase Bank of Bethesda but no longer appears able to close the deal , according to people familiar with the situation .
