The rapid growth of the District 's charter school movement , which accounts for more than a third of the city 's public school enrollment , is starting to see signs of cooling because of the national financial crisis , experts in the field say .
Efforts to expand schools face longer roads to completion , hobbled by a smaller pool of potential investors and higher costs for access to capital .
Charter officials also worry that <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> opened small schools might have trouble securing lines of credit to meet regular business expenses .
The city 's 60 charter schools , spread over 92 campuses , receive a per - pupil allotment and an annual facilities allowance from the District , which will total about $ 360 million <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2008">this year</TIMEX3> for an enrollment of about 26,000 .
The private nonprofit groups that run the schools use those funds for operating costs and often turn to bank loans , along with grants , fundraising and investor tax credits , to finance the construction or renovation of buildings .
Local school officials said they have not heard of a project that has been scuttled .
But even charter schools with track records as effective alternatives to traditional public schools find economic conditions more challenging .
KIPP DC , which operates four schools in low - income neighborhoods , is trying to line up financing for a $ 23 million renovation of the former Douglass Transition Academy , a closed public school in Ward 8 .
It has leased the building as a home for a new high school and early childhood center it wants to open <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2009-FA">next fall</TIMEX3> .
Allison Fansler , KIPP DC 's president and chief operating officer , said <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2008-W41">this week</TIMEX3> that financing for the renovation of leased properties is difficult in the best of circumstances because of the lack of collateral for a bank to fall back on if a loan goes bad .
But Fansler said the charter community 's traditional banking partners , such as Bank of America , PNC and M&T Bank , have been tentative .
` ` We 're reaching out to build as many relationships as we can , '' said Fansler , who remained optimistic that a deal can be struck .
` ` There are a lot of ways we can mitigate this , but it 's just more complicated and expensive . ''
Other ventures have been delayed by the economic uncertainty .
C sar Ch vez Public Charter Schools for Public Policy had hoped to have a third campus , at the old Bruce School building in Petworth , up and running <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2008-FA">this fall</TIMEX3> .
Bryan Patten , chief financial officer , said the original plan involved generating money for the renovation through the sale of tax - exempt bonds .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2007" mod="MID">mid-2007</TIMEX3> , he said , ` ` it was an attractive option , but every time we talked to the bank , the interest rate went up . ''
Eventually , the school secured a conventional construction loan , but it will not be able to occupy Bruce until <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2009-FA">next fall</TIMEX3> .
Nationally , the situation is much the same -- schools are n't shut down but delayed , charter operators said .
Mike Piscal , founder of the Inner City Education Foundation in Los Angeles , said <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2008-W40">last week</TIMEX3> that its campuses would expand from 13 to 35 <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DURATION" value="P8Y" mod="MORE_THAN">over the next eight years</TIMEX3> .
` ` So far , deals that would be done with 20 percent down <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> require 30 percent .
Deals that would take <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DURATION" value="P2M">two</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DURATION" value="P3M">three months</TIMEX3> are <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> taking <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DURATION" value="P5M">five</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DURATION" value="P6M">six months</TIMEX3> , '' he said .
The market meltdown comes at a moment of unusual opportunity for the local charter community .
<TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2008-09">Last month</TIMEX3> , the District government revised its plans for the use of school buildings closed for low enrollment <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2007">last year</TIMEX3> .
It issued a new request for expressions of interest in the properties exclusively from charter schools .
An earlier request had been opened to other private businesses and had limited the number of charter schools that could participate .
It 's not clear how the climate will affect interest in the buildings .
Offers are due by <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="2008-10-27">Oct. 27</TIMEX3> .
Charter school officials said they were particularly concerned that some of the new schools that opened <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="2008-FA">this fall</TIMEX3> with small numbers of students and no track record might have difficulty securing credit for working capital .
At least two in Northeast Washington , Thea Bowman Preparatory Academy and Washington Yu Ying , have fallen short of their projected enrollment , which means their quarterly payment due from the District <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DATE" value="2008-10">this month</TIMEX3> will be lower than anticipated .
` ` Downward adjustments can have a dramatic impact on cash flow , '' said Jeremy Williams , finance manager for the Public Charter School Board , adding that he was concerned that the schools would have difficulty borrowing operating capital .
Washington Yu Ying , which offers a Chinese immersion program for prekindergarten , kindergarten and first - grade students , is about 20 short of its projected enrollment of 150 .
Executive Director Mary Shaffner said she had begun the application process for a line of credit and would raise private money .
Thea Bowman , which has attracted 47 of the 100 fifth - and sixth - graders it expected , has laid off three staff members and cut salaries to make its budget .
Principal Mark Cosenza said that the school was at no immediate risk but that he would begin fundraising .
