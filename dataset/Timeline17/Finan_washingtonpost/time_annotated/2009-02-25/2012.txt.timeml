Still the best political coverage .
In Speech to Congress , Obama Outlines His Plans for Economic Recovery President Obama offered a grim portrait of America 's plight in an address to a joint session of Congress <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="TIME" value="2009-02-24TNI">last night</TIMEX3> , but he promised to lead an economic renewal that would lift the country out of its <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> crisis without bankrupting its future .
Striking an optimistic tone that has been absent from his speeches in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent weeks</TIMEX3> , the president said his stimulus plan , bank bailout proposal , housing programs and health - care overhaul would work in concert to turn around the nation 's struggling economy .
And while he bluntly described a country beset by historic economic challenges and continued threats abroad , he said the solution lies in directly confronting -- not ignoring -- those problems .
` ` The weight of this crisis will not determine the destiny of this nation , '' he said .
` ` The answers to our problems do n't lie beyond our reach .
They exist in our laboratories and universities , in our fields and our factories , in the imaginations of our entrepreneurs and the pride of the hardest - working people on Earth . ''
In an address that largely shunned foreign policy to focus on the economy , Obama added : ` ` <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> is the time to jump - start job creation , restart lending , and invest in areas like energy , health care and education that will grow our economy , even as we make hard choices to bring our deficit down . ''
The 52 - minute speech was greeted with sustained applause in the House chamber , which he had helped populate with more members of his party .
Republican and Democratic lawmakers alike rose repeatedly to offer their approval of the president 's rhetoric and his promise of recovery .
Obama received a standing ovation when he vowed that corporate chief executives would no longer travel on private jets at the same time they laid off thousands of workers .
` ` Those days are over , '' he said .
Lawmakers leapt to their feet again when he declared that ` ` health - care reform can not wait , it must not wait , and it will not wait another year . ''
While he largely avoided partisan rhetoric and did not directly point the finger of blame at his predecessor , George W. Bush , Obama did describe an ` ` era '' of greed and short - term profit that he said the nation is <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> leaving behind , and he stressed that he had not created but rather ` ` inherited '' the $ 1 trillion deficit , along with what he called ` ` a financial crisis and a costly recession . ''
The ` ` day of reckoning has arrived , '' he declared , warning members of both parties in Congress that they will be forced to sacrifice ` ` worthy priorities '' as the crisis continues .

But he made it clear that he is not prepared to retreat from his own ambitious agenda .
The president called on Congress to pass a market - based cap on carbon pollution .
He vowed a renewed effort to provide health care to all Americans .
And he called on Americans to attend <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P1Y" mod="EQUAL_OR_MORE">at least one year</TIMEX3> of college or vocational training , pledging that by <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2020">2020</TIMEX3> , the country will again lead the world in the proportion of college graduates .
Obama did seek to temper expectations in his address , acknowledging that he can not ` ` solve every problem or address every issue . ''
But he promised to deliver a budget <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2009-02-26">tomorrow</TIMEX3> that will serve as a new ` ` vision for America -- as a blueprint for our future . ''
He avoided in - depth discussion of his Iraq policy , saying only that in the <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">coming days</TIMEX3> he will ` ` announce a way forward in Iraq that leaves Iraq to its people and responsibly ends this war . ''
That announcement could come as early as <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2009-02-20">Friday</TIMEX3> , during a trip to North Carolina .
Advisers said he is considering a plan to withdraw all U.S. combat troops from Iraq as soon as <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2010-08">August 2010</TIMEX3> , <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2010-11">three months later</TIMEX3> than promised during the campaign .
After weeks of persistent questions about whether he had grown too downcast and pessimistic in describing the economic crisis to the American people , White House officials said Obama was seeking to strike an appropriate balance between hope -- the mantra of his campaign -- and realism in an era of serious problems .
He sought to juxtapose those ideas repeatedly , saying at one point : ` ` While our economy may be weakened and our confidence shaken , though we are living through difficult and uncertain times , <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="TIME" value="2009-02-25TNI">tonight</TIMEX3> I want every American to know this : We will rebuild , we will recover , and the United States of America will emerge stronger than before .
