The Royal Bank of Scotland , a global giant whose spectacular crash has become a symbol of banking excesses of <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="199">the past decade</TIMEX3> , reported the largest annual corporate loss in the history of the United Kingdom on <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2009-02-26">Thursday</TIMEX3> .
The bank , which is <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> 70 percent owned by British taxpayers following an unprecedented government bailout , reported that its 2008 losses were 24.1 billion pounds , or about $ 34.5 billion at <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> exchange rates .
The RBS losses are the latest in a string of increasingly grim financial results in Britain , where -- as in the United States -- the global financial crisis has caused thousands of job losses and business closings and record numbers of home repossessions .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown will discuss the global response to the financial crisis <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2009-W10">next week</TIMEX3> when he meets with President Obama at the White House and addresses a joint session of the U.S. Congress .
The bank , in a statement , said it would seek government insurance for $ 465 billion in toxic assets through a new program designed to shore up teetering banks .
Under that scheme , which is similar to a ` ` bad bank '' scenario in which financial institutions are able to separate performing assets from nonperforming ones , the bank would be responsible for the first $ 27.9 billion in losses on those assets .
After that , taxpayers would be responsible for 90 percent of any new losses , the bank said .
Lloyds Banking Group , which includes the merged Lloyds TSB and HBOS , is also widely reported to be planning to sign up for the scheme <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2009-02-27">Friday</TIMEX3> , when it will report 2008 results that are also expected to show remarkable losses .
` ` We owe our continued independence to the U.K. government and taxpayers and are very thankful for their support , '' said RBS Chairman Philip Hampton , whose bank has been partly nationalized with an injection of $ 28.6 billion in government funds .
The bank said <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2009-02-26">Thursday</TIMEX3> that the government would inject an additional $ 18.6 billion in capital .
The bank also has an option to seek $ 8.5 billion more .

While the fall of RBS is a complex story combining both corporate hubris and the stunning misjudgments of the subprime mortgage crisis , former chief executive Fred Goodwin has emerged as the prime symbol of the bank 's failures .
Goodwin 's hard - charging expansion of what began as a modest Scottish bank -- particularly the disastrous <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2007">2007</TIMEX3> takeover of Dutch bank ABN Amro -- is widely seen in Britain as a key reason RBS collapsed under the weight of massive bad debt .
So anger , both among the public and in the halls of Parliament , grew <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="2009-02-26">Thursday</TIMEX3> when it was disclosed that Goodwin , 50 , was awarded a lifetime annual pension of $ 931,000 .
