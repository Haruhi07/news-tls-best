World leaders have vowed to help prevent future financial meltdowns by creating international accounting standards so all companies would play by the same rules , but the effort has instead been mired in loopholes and political pressures .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2008-10">October</TIMEX3> , largely hidden from public view , the International Accounting Standards Board changed the rules so European banks could make their balance sheets look better .
The action let the banks rewrite history , picking and choosing among their problem investments to essentially claim that some had been on a different set of books before the financial crisis started .
The results were dramatic .
Deutsche Bank shifted $ 32 billion of troubled assets , turning a $ 970 million quarterly pretax loss into $ 120 million profit .

And the securities markets were fooled , bidding Deutsche Bank 's shares up nearly 19 percent on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2008-10-30">Oct. 30</TIMEX3> , the day it made the startling announcement that it had turned an unexpected profit .
The change has had dramatic consequences within the cloistered world of accounting , shattering the credibility of the IASB -- the very body whose rules have been adopted by 113 countries and is supposed to become the global standard - setter , including for the United States , within <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="PXY">a few years</TIMEX3> .
Sir David Tweedie , chairman of the IASB , acknowledged that the body needs more protection from political manipulation before it can claim that it has become the global gold standard .
Tweedie said he nearly resigned over the rule change demanded by European politicians .
` ` I was so frustrated by the whole thing , '' he said .
` ` All the time when we are trying to build a global accounting system , and we are pretty close to it , and then suddenly out of left field this thing appears .
It 's just absolutely exasperating . ''
U.S. standards have been set by the Financial Accounting Standards Board since <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="1973">1973</TIMEX3> .
` ` <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Right now</TIMEX3> , there is no credibility , '' said Robert Denham , chairman of the Financial Accounting Foundation , which oversees the FASB .
` ` If we are going to have global accounting standards , my view is that is not going to work if the IASB is going to be jerked around by the European Commission .
That is the very real risk that is posed by the EC coercion and the IASB 's response . ''
The episode exposes how small , incremental changes in arcane accounting rules can affect billions of dollars in market value and corporate profitability .
In turn , the money at risk raises the political stakes , as desperate companies begin to lobby political leaders to insist on changes that normally would come about only after a careful discussion and evaluation by experts .
For years , there has been a disconnect between U.S. and international accounting rules .
With the history of corporate litigation in the United States , U.S. standards tend to be exact and explicit , making it easier for companies to defend themselves in court .
International rules rely on broad principles , giving companies greater leeway to make their own judgments .
An extensive review of international accounting standards published <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2008-11">last month</TIMEX3> by Moody 's Investors Service found significant differences between two French companies on one key issue -- even though they used the same accounting firm .
Nevertheless , more than 110 countries have already adopted international rules since the IASB was established in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2001">2001</TIMEX3> , with Japan , South Korea , India and Canada soon to make the switch .
Tweedie expects that 150 countries will have adopted IASB rules within <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P3Y">the next three years</TIMEX3> .
The Securities and Exchange Commission on <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2008-11-14">Nov. 14</TIMEX3> adopted a plan to have all U.S. companies prepare their statements using international standards for fiscal years ending after <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2016-12-15">Dec. 15 , 2016</TIMEX3> .
More than 100 of the largest companies would be permitted to adopt the rules as soon as <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2009">next year</TIMEX3> .
But the financial crisis demonstrated how vulnerable the fledgling system is to political pressure .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2008-10-08">Oct. 8</TIMEX3> , the leaders of France , Germany , Italy , Britain and the European Commission met in Paris to discuss the worldwide economic crisis .
They issued a statement saying they were working together ` ` within the European Union and with our international partners '' to ensure the safety and stability of the worldwide banking system .
But buried within the statement was a sentence warning that European banks should not face a competitive disadvantage with U.S. banks ` ` in terms of accounting rules and their interpretation . ''
The leaders added ominously : ` ` This issue must be resolved by the end of the month . ''
At issue is an accounting standard known as fair value , or mark to market , in which companies disclose how much an asset could fetch on the open market .
With the values of assets plummeting , banks were suddenly stuck with paper losses on assets they could no longer sell .
With some critics saying the provision was forcing banks to take large write - downs , the SEC and FASB issued guidance in <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2008-09" mod="END">late September</TIMEX3> that companies could use their own internal models for assigning a value to assets -- in essence , a nod to the principles - based international rules .

But European officials smelled a rat .
Under rare circumstances , U.S. companies are permitted to reclassify assets they were actively seeking to trade into long - term ` ` loans , '' using an accounting rule that was considered weaker than the international equivalent .
The international rules did not permit such transfers , and European officials feared that the new guidance was handing the Americans a competitive advantage .
Shortly after the European leaders ' statement , Commissioner Charlie McCreevy of the European Commission , who was in charge of the European Union internal market , signaled he would introduce legal changes , overriding the international rules .
McCreevy decided to exploit a loophole in the system -- that all accounting rules must be adopted as legislation by the E.U. .
So McCreevy was going to force the changes on the IASB by threatening to remove -- or carve out -- the existing regulation , leaving nothing in its place .
` ` We made it clear what the IASB should accept , '' said Oliver Drewes , a spokesman for McCreevy .
` ` There is always the right , and threat and the pressure , that one could go for a carve - out for European companies . ''
Tweedie said the rulemaking body had only <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DURATION" value="P4D">four days</TIMEX3> to act before McCreevy pushed through a change in the law , even though accounting changes of this magnitude would normally take months to achieve .
Unlike the U.S. board , the international board has no regulator like the SEC to help shield it from political pressure .
So the IASB was at the mercy of the European Commission .
` ` There had been pressure on him , I suspect , from some of the European leaders , '' Tweedie said , referring to McCreevy .
` ` It was quite clear it was going to be pushed through and that would have been a disaster .
We were faced with this hole being blown in the European accounting , and we just wanted to step in and control it . ''
But the IASB bowed to demands to let the firms backdate the accounting shift to <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2009-07" mod="START">the beginning of July</TIMEX3> -- something not permitted under U.S. rules .
In a <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> report , Moody 's wrote that the backdating provision could distort a bank 's earnings and capital position , since ` ` it allows managements to ` cherry - pick ' selected assets '' and ` ` distort their economic reality , '' making it more -- not less -- difficult to compare global bank performance .
` ` The measure does not make much sense in the first place , '' said J.F. Tremblay , a Moody 's vice president .
` ` But the fact that a board can be influenced like that is not good news . ''
