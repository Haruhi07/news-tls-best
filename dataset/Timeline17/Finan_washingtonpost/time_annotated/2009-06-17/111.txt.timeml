By Andrew Harrer -- Bloomberg News -RRB- NEW YORK , <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2009-06-16">June 16</TIMEX3> --
The acquisition of Barclays Global Investors by BlackRock , which has emerged from the financial crisis as a powerhouse and adviser to the U.S. government , creates a giant overseeing $ 2.7 trillion in assets , making it by far the largest money manager in the world .
To grasp the size of that purchasing power , consider : The Federal Reserve , in its unprecedented effort to rehabilitate the economy , has expanded its balance sheet by $ 1.2 trillion .
The federal government 's <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3> budget is $ 3.6 trillion .
The gross domestic product for the United States , the world 's largest economy , was $ 11.7 trillion <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2008">last year</TIMEX3> .
At a time when ` ` too - big - to - fail '' institutions such as AIG and Citigroup have been injected with billions in taxpayer funds , some analysts are raising questions about the scale of the BlackRock enterprise and its ties to the federal government .
President Obama is set to propose <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2009-06-17">Wednesday</TIMEX3> a plan to tighten financial regulation , but largely absent from the debate about regulatory reform has been the role of asset managers , which oversee about $ 21 trillion of assets globally for institutional investors such as pension funds , hedge funds and university endowments .
In an interview <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2009-06-16">Tuesday</TIMEX3> , BlackRock 's chairman and chief executive Larry Fink , who started the firm <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="1988">21 years ago</TIMEX3> in a modest New York office , said ` ` $ 2.7 trillion may sound like a lot of money , but the reality is , most of the added money from BGI is in stock and bond index funds . ''
He disputed the notion that BlackRock could pose a risk to the financial system and the larger economy .
For one , he said , ` ` 100 percent '' of BlackRock 's business is managing assets for clients as a fiduciary responsibility , not trading for its bottom line .
BlackRock also uses minimal leverage -- $ 20 billion , or less than 1 percent , of its $ 2.7 trillion in assets is bought with money lent to clients , Fink said .
The use of leverage , or debt , in the pursuit of higher profits amplified losses for financial institutions , including firms that no longer exist such as Bear Stearns .
` ` There 's more systemic risk in a hedge fund that has $ 10 billion in assets that 's leveraged 40 to 1 than a BlackRock , '' he said , adding that every entity with more than $ 1 billion in assets should be regulated regardless of whether it is public or private .
` ` For every dollar of equity BlackRock has , we have a dollar of assets .
That is why it 's not a too - big - to - fail issue , '' Fink said .
` ` What has happened <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="P5Y" mod="MORE_THAN">over the past five years</TIMEX3> , in terms of the tremendous leveraging of certain financial institutions , does not apply to BlackRock .
You ca n't compare the two . ''
Responding to concerns that have been raised by some members of Congress about BlackRock 's role in helping the federal government evaluate and manage the rescues of troubled financial institutions , Fink said there was a fire wall between investment management and the part of his firm that performs risk analysis , called BlackRock Solutions .
` ` It so happened that because of the financial crisis , many institutions , public and private , are utilizing that service , '' Fink said .
That business <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> analyzes risk for $ 7 trillion of assets and clients include sovereign wealth funds and other governments , he said .
Indeed , BlackRock and other asset managers are ` ` not as risky '' as a dealer who writes billions of dollars worth of credit - default swaps and whose collapse could spark a chain reaction of failures , said John Coffee , a law professor at Columbia University .
But , he added , ` ` If you were giving common advice to $ 3 trillion worth of funds , you are going to be having an impact that could increase systemic risk .
There can be systemic risk if one person or entity is able to make a bet - the - farm - investment decision based on poor investment analysis for an extraordinary large amount of capital . ''
