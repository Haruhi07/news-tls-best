LONDON , <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2009-03-30">March 30</TIMEX3> -- At <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2009-W14">this week</TIMEX3> 's summit of world leaders , the big winner will be the developing world , with the United States , Europe and Japan offering China , India , Brazil and other emerging nations unprecedented new influence in global financial decisions .
Several major developing countries -- most notably China -- are also in late - stage negotiations to win new authority to shape decisions at the Washington - based International Monetary Fund , an organization that developing nations have long complained dictate to them rather than hear them out .
The new role for developing nations signifies a tilt in the world economic order being accelerated by the financial crisis .
Their leaders blame the collapse of financial institutions on bad management and poor regulations by the West , which , they argue , has robbed rich countries of the moral authority to rebuild financial standards on their own .
` ` This crisis was fostered and boosted by irrational behavior of some people that are white , blue - eyed , '' Brazil President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva told reporters in Brasilia <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2009-W13">last week</TIMEX3> after a meeting with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown .
` ` Before the crisis they looked like they knew everything about economics , and they have demonstrated they know nothing about economics . ''
The one - day London summit is expected to end <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2009-03-26">Thursday</TIMEX3> with leaders from many of the world 's biggest economies agreeing on new regulations for banks and hedge funds , a large increase in funding for the IMF and a pledge to fight protectionism .

But early versions of a draft communique the leaders are expected to release indicate that there will be relatively few specifics on those issues .
They are also expected to tread lightly on U.S. calls -- opposed by many in Europe -- to boost government spending worldwide to combat the global economic crisis .
U.S. officials indicated <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2009-W13">last week</TIMEX3> that they would not press nations to adhere to specific spending targets .
Instead , analysts said that perhaps the most concrete agreement on <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2009-03-26">Thursday</TIMEX3> will revolve around the new status bestowed on emerging countries .
The United States and Britain need the deep pockets of nations such as China and Saudi Arabia <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> more than ever as they seek buyers for billions of dollars worth of debt to cover the cost of stimulus spending and bank bailouts at home .
In response , China in particular is exerting more authority .
Beijing has gone so far as to push for a new global reserve currency besides the U.S. dollar , a proposal that , while dismissed by Washington , will nevertheless get an airing in London <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2009-W14">this week</TIMEX3> .
The IMF , which since its inception at the end of World War II has been largely funded and controlled by rich nations , is also seeking significant new contributions from cash - rich emerging economies as it comes under enormous strain to bail out a growing number of hard - hit and poor countries .
But the largest developing countries , many of whose economies are growing despite the global downturn , have made it clear that in exchange for the cash , they want a seat at the decision - making table .
<TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2009-W12">Two weeks ago</TIMEX3> at a finance ministers meeting ahead of the summit , Brazil , China , Russia and India issued their own communique saying they want more say in global affairs .
There has also been growing momentum to increase the presence of developing countries on other important bodies such as the United Nations Security Council .
` ` We call for urgent action with regard to voice and representation in the IMF in order that they better reflect their real economic weights , '' the four countries said in the communique .
The United States <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2009-W14">this week</TIMEX3> is proposing that five developing nations -- China , Brazil , Russia , Mexico and India -- be given more influence on IMF lending decisions in return for tens of billions of dollars in new donations , according to an administration official .
Washington is looking for world leaders to endorse the idea <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2009-W14">this week</TIMEX3> , with details to be worked out before the IMF 's annual meeting in Washington <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2009-04">next month</TIMEX3> .
Some European governments , however , are cautious , fearing they would lose power in an institution traditionally headed by one of their own .
The global leaders <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2009-W14">this week</TIMEX3> are also set to endorse the expansion of the Financial Stability Forum in Switzerland , which will emerge with a new name -- the Financial Stability Board -- and a vastly expanded mission .
The organization <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> brings together regulators , central bankers and finance ministers from a cluster of wealthy nations .
The new membership will include 10 emerging markets including Argentina , Brazil , South Africa and China .
The institution , which previously served as a little - used forum for exchanging ideas , will draft the details to enhance global standards for financial institutions , including benchmarks for executive pay and how much risk they can take on .
Critics , however , charge that the entrance of so many emerging nations into the club at once could complicate the process .
` ` You can understand China ; they are part of the global financial system <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> and you have to hear them out , '' said Howard Davies , director of the London School of Economics .
` ` But while we may have messed things up royally , that does n't mean we should be taking advice from Argentina . '' ''
