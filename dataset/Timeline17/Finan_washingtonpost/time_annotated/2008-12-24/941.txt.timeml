The Mall In Columbia -RRB- Retailers have blamed the global financial crisis for a litany of ills over <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2007">the past year</TIMEX3> : slumping sales , mass layoffs and bankruptcy filings .
<TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> , they are looking to the economy to explain <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> spikes in shoplifting from their stores .
Though individual retailers do not publicly report crime data , a survey of 52 national chain stores released <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2008-12">this month</TIMEX3> by the Retail Industry Leaders Association -LRB- RILA -RRB- , a trade group , showed that 84 percent reported an increase in shoplifting since the recession began .
About 80 percent said organized retail crime had also jumped , and more than half said robberies and burglaries have risen , as well .
` ` Bad guys are smart .
People do not give them credit , '' said Brad Brekke , vice president of assets protection at Target .
` ` They understand odds are either for or against them , and if they see the odds swing in their favor , they will take advantage of it . ''
In the Washington area , Alexandria police said there have been more shoplifting reports nearly <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="SET" value="P1M" quant="EVERY">every month</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2008">this year</TIMEX3> compared with <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2007">last year</TIMEX3> , though they expect <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2008-12">December</TIMEX3> to slacken .
In Tysons Corner , Lt . Josh Laitinen said his officers arrested 40 people <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P3W" mod="MORE_THAN">over the past three weeks</TIMEX3> on shoplifting charges .
And in Montgomery County , Detective David Hill , who oversees the county 's retail crime division , said many stores have told him that crime is up .
` ` I ' m sure it 's a major concern for all of them , '' Hill said .
` ` No one wants to just give anything away . ''
Retail crime typically increases during the holiday season as customers flood stores staffed with temporary -- and often untested -- employees .
Doorbuster holiday discounts and aggressive merchandising , such as stocking more products near entryways , also provide ne'er - do - wells with more opportunities .
But retailers and law enforcement officials say the economic downturn is resulting in more frequent and more aggressive crimes .
Fighting these trends is an expensive proposition for retailers .
According to the Center for Retail Research , a British organization that did a global survey , U.S. stores spent about $ 12 billion <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2007">last year</TIMEX3> to combat retail crime .
Many employ security officers to monitor surveillance cameras throughout the store .
Some companies are testing new technology that can detect when a shelf is cleared of merchandise and then alert employees , according to Lee Pernice , director of retail marketing for security firm ADT .
Target is looking at so - called ` ` benefit denial '' technology that requires popular products to be activated at checkout in order to work , Brekke said , similar to the process used for gift cards .
It also has begun using spiderwrap -- cables with a built - in sensor -- on hot items .
But many retailers are relying on standards such as beefing up security during the holiday season and training employees to spot suspicious behavior .
Pernice said companies face a tough choice as they watch sales and revenue slump : Does it cost more to be a victim of crime or to fight it ?
Retailers lost an average of nearly $ 35 billion , or about 1.4 percent of their inventory , to theft <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2007">last year</TIMEX3> , according to an annual survey conducted by the University of Florida .
During the most <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> recession in <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2001">2001</TIMEX3> , so - called shrinkage rates averaged 1.8 percent .
Results for <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2008">this year</TIMEX3> will not be available until <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3> .
Economic downturns can lead to increased retail crime as law enforcement organizations cut costs and personnel .
Retailers face declining sales , and some are choosing to reduce security staff , according to retail and loss prevention experts .
Hundreds of stores across the country are being shut down , and several retailers have filed for bankruptcy protection , scenarios that tend to lure more crooks .
The financial crisis has drained many consumers ' wallets as layoffs mount and 401 -LRB- k
-RRB- s continue their freefall .
That has contributed to an increase in so - called ` ` opportunistic '' theft from shoppers stealing for personal use or consumption .
The items stolen can span a cost range , from drugstore cosmetics to pricey electronics .
Hill said many of the retail thefts he has seen over <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2007">the past year</TIMEX3> were committed by first - time offenders .
` ` Some people are being forced to make bad decisions , '' said Joe LaRocca , vice president of loss prevention for the National Retail Federation , a trade group .
` ` There is no right reason to steal from retailers . ''
More troubling to the industry is the growth in organized retail crime , sophisticated operations that target popular items such as baby formula or diabetic strips for resale .
According to the RILA survey , 89 percent of grocery and drug stores said such crimes had risen in <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent months</TIMEX3> , the most of any category of retailer .
Paul Jones , vice president of asset protection for RILA , said the increased demand for low - priced goods during these turbulent economic times is providing retail crime gangs with a larger market for stolen items .
They typically sell their products through online auction sites for less than market price , a process known as e - fencing .
Consumers often do not know -- and sometimes do not care -- about the origin of those goods .
Jones said several organized retail crimes have been tied to gangs and even the mob .
<TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2008" mod="START">Earlier this year</TIMEX3> , a high - ranking member of a crime family in New Jersey was accused of using fake bar codes to buy merchandise at Lowe 's for pennies and then reselling it .
` ` People think it 's a victimless crime , that you 're stealing from a corporation , '' Pernice said .
But ` ` it translates into higher prices for you and me and every other American out there . ''
