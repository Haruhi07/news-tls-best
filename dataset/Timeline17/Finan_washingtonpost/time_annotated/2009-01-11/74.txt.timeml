This article incorrectly said that the total public debt held by the American people <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2008-09">last September</TIMEX3> stood at $ 5.8 trillion , excluding debt issued to the Social Security Trust Fund or held by the Federal Reserve .
In fact , that sum includes debt held by the Federal Reserve .
We 're Borrowing Like Mad .
Can the U.S. Pay It Back ?
In its battle against the financial crisis , the U.S. government has extended its full faith and credit to an ever - growing swath of the private sector : first homeowners , then banks , <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> car companies .
Soon , President - elect Barack Obama will put the government credit card to work with a massive fiscal boost for the economy .
Necessary as these steps are , they raise a worry of their own : Can the United States pay the money back ?
The notion seems absurd : Banana republics default , not the world 's biggest , richest economy , right ?
The United States has unparalleled wealth , a stable legal tradition , responsible macroeconomic policies and a top - notch , triple - A credit rating .
U.S. Treasury bonds are routinely called ` ` risk - free , '' and the United States has the unique privilege of borrowing in the currency that other countries like to hold as foreign - exchange reserves .
Yes , default is unlikely .
But it is no longer unthinkable .
Thanks to the advent of credit derivatives -- financial contracts that allow investors to speculate on or protect against default -- we can <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> observe how likely global markets think it is that Uncle Sam will renege on America 's mounting debts .
<TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2008-W01">Last week</TIMEX3> , markets pegged the probability of a U.S. default at 6 percent <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P10Y" mod="MORE_THAN">over the next 10 years</TIMEX3> , compared with just 1 percent <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2007-W01">a year ago</TIMEX3> .
For technical reasons , this is not a precise reading of investors ' views .
Nonetheless , the trend is real , and it is grounded in some pretty fundamental concerns .
The most important is the coming surge in the federal debt .
At the end of <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2008">the last fiscal year</TIMEX3> , in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2008-09">September</TIMEX3> , the total public debt held by the American people -LRB- excluding debt issued to the Social Security Trust Fund or held by the Federal Reserve -RRB- stood at $ 5.8 trillion , or 41 percent of gross domestic product -- about what the debt - to - GDP ratio has averaged since <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="1956">1956</TIMEX3> .
But the Congressional Budget Office projects deficits of $ 1.9 trillion <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DURATION" value="P2Y" mod="MORE_THAN">over the next two years</TIMEX3> .
Add almost $ 800 billion of stimulus spending , and U.S. debt soars to 60 percent of GDP by <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3> -- the highest level since <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="195" mod="START">the early 1950s</TIMEX3> , when the nation was working off its World War II and Korean War debts .
The other major cause for concern is that the federal government has taken on massive ` ` contingent liabilities '' -- loans and guarantees that do n't become actual costs until the borrower defaults and the federal guarantee has to be honored .
For example , Washington has purchased $ 45 billion of preferred stock of Citigroup but has also agreed to backstop up to about $ 240 billion of its losses .
Bianco Research , a Chicago financial research firm , puts the total of such contingent liabilities -LRB- as of <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2009-12-29">Dec. 29</TIMEX3>
-RRB- at more than $ 8 trillion .
The U.S. government wo n't shell out anything close to that , of course ; it may not pay out any money and might even turn a profit .
But the worse the economy gets , the more likely it is that some of those contingent liabilities will become actual liabilities .
How unprecedented would default be ?
The United States has never failed to repay a debt in its history .
But it has twice altered the repayment terms , notes a study by Carmen M. Reinhart of the University of Maryland and Kenneth S. Rogoff of Harvard University .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="1790">1790</TIMEX3> , when the infant republic took over the states ' colonial - era debts , it deferred some interest for <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DURATION" value="P10Y">10 years</TIMEX3> .
A more pertinent case occurred during the Great Depression .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="1933">1933</TIMEX3> , President Franklin D. Roosevelt devalued the dollar by 41 percent against gold .
This helped end the vicious cycle of bank failures , deflation and default that had worsened the economic downturn , but it created another dilemma .
Since the Civil War , borrowers in the United States , including the government , had routinely issued bonds that allowed the holder to demand repayment in gold or its dollar equivalent , based on the price of gold when the bond was issued .
Devaluation would have dramatically raised , in dollar terms , the burden of repayment .
So in <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="1933">1933</TIMEX3> , Congress repealed the gold clause , a decision the Supreme Court upheld in <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DATE" value="1935">1935</TIMEX3> .
Reinhart argues that these episodes show that there are many forms of default other than the outright failure to redeem a bond .
She thinks it exceedingly unlikely that the United States would ever default on its Treasury debt but says that a default is more likely to happen on the ` ` periphery '' :
A state government or a federally backed entity might renege .
Reinhart notes that Washington has issued a lot of guarantees <TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> , such as the Treasury Department 's declaration that it ` ` effectively '' backs the debts of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
Future governments could balk at honoring those guarantees .
<TIMEX3 tid="t36" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> , one reason the United States should not have to default is that , in a pinch , it can print the money it needs to pay off its debt .
In practice , it would not literally print dollar bills ; rather , the Federal Reserve would purchase its bonds .
Still , the effect is the same : The Fed , by ` ` monetizing '' government debt , would create vast new supplies of dollars to chase the same goods and services and thus also create inflation .
This money - printing option is not available to countries that issue debt payable in foreign currencies or to countries that have adopted the euro , which is controlled by the independent European Central Bank .
All the same , a country may not always prefer inflation to default .
Reinhart and Rogoff found numerous instances of countries defaulting on their domestic currency debts , such as Russia , which did so in <TIMEX3 tid="t40" type="DATE" value="1998">1998</TIMEX3> .
` ` Why would a government refuse to pay its domestic public debt in full when it can simply inflate the problem away ? ''
` ` Sometimes , the government may view repudiation as the lesser evil . ''
Default would certainly seem preferable to the social and economic unrest that hyperinflation has visited on Zimbabwe <TIMEX3 tid="t45" type="DATE" value="2009-01-11">today</TIMEX3> or on Latin America in <TIMEX3 tid="t44" type="DATE" value="198">the 1980s</TIMEX3> .
Of course , it would be ridiculous to put the United States in the same company as Russia , much less Zimbabwe .
Nonetheless , even if Washington never defaults , it can still suffer if questions about its ability to repay its debts affect its creditworthiness and thus its cost of borrowing .
Consider Japan , which spent <TIMEX3 tid="t46" type="DATE" value="199">the 1990s</TIMEX3> running up enormous budget deficits in an effort to kick - start economic growth .
It failed , and gross government debt rose from 71 percent of GDP in <TIMEX3 tid="t47" type="DATE" value="1990">1990</TIMEX3> to 115 percent in <TIMEX3 tid="t48" type="DATE" value="1998">1998</TIMEX3> , when Moody 's Investors Service stripped Japan of its triple - A credit rating .
Moody 's figured that Japan 's probability of default , while still low , had nonetheless risen -- even though that debt was owed almost entirely in yen .
Japan 's rating continued to slide until <TIMEX3 tid="t49" type="DATE" value="2002">2002</TIMEX3> , at which point its gross debt had reached 154 percent of GDP .
Having its credit rating slashed was a stunning comedown for the world 's second - largest economy and largest creditor nation .
Nonetheless , Japan 's borrowing costs were n't much affected , in part because almost all its debt was held by Japanese investors , who were not much inclined to sell it .
The U.S. government might not have the same good fortune : More than half of its publicly held debt is owned by foreigners .
-LRB-
Of course , many of those foreigners are central banks with no attractive alternatives to the dollar .
-RRB- One key lesson of Japan 's experience : It 's not just the level of debt that affects a country 's creditworthiness but the performance of the underlying economy .
The size of the economy determines the resources the government can call on to repay its debts .
