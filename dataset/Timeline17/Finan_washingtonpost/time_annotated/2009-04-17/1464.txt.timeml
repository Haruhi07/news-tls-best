General Growth Properties , the giant shopping mall company whose holdings stretch from Tysons Corner to the planned community of Columbia and Baltimore 's Inner Harbor , <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2009-04-16">yesterday</TIMEX3> sought protection in bankruptcy court , citing debts of more than $ 27 billion .
The bankruptcy heralds a wave of trouble in commercial real estate that threatens to put another damper on the economy , industry analysts said .
By <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011" mod="END">the end of 2011</TIMEX3> , $ 1.2 trillion of commercial real estate debt will come due , and like General Growth , many of the borrowers will be unable to refinance or repay their loans , said Gregory H. Leisch , chief executive of Delta Associates , which tracks the industry .
That would spell more losses for banks and institutional investors such as life insurance companies that are already coping with the meltdown in residential real estate .
The bankruptcy adds a new element of uncertainty to the future development of Columbia , where General Growth has been working on a long - term plan that county officials have been counting on to revitalize the downtown .
The economic crisis already assured a delay for the first major effort to remake the <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="1960">1960</TIMEX3> - era planned community in decades .
But for people visiting General Growth 's malls , the Chapter 11 reorganization could be imperceptible .
` ` We 're convinced that we 're going to make this bankruptcy filing invisible to the shoppers in our malls , '' company president Thomas J. Nolan Jr. told reporters .
` ` We 're open for business <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2009-04-17">today</TIMEX3> , and we 're going to be open for business <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2009-04-18">tomorrow</TIMEX3> . ''
General Growth , the nation 's second - largest shopping mall owner , had struggled for months to win reprieves on billions of dollars of debt , much of which was past due .
The company tried to sell some properties to raise money , but the same lack of credit that prevented it from replacing its loans kept prospective buyers from raising money .
` ` What it tells you is that if they do n't get the financial system restarted , then every real estate company is going to go bankrupt , '' said William Ackman , principal of the hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management , which holds a major stake in General Growth .
Other observers said General Growth left itself exceptionally vulnerable to the recession and credit crunch because it had mortgaged itself so heavily .
` ` They 're the poster child for too much debt , and they have been for <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P5Y">five years</TIMEX3> , '' said analyst Richard Moore of RBC Capital Markets .
The company , based in Chicago , owns or manages more than 200 malls in 44 states .
Its interests include Harborplace and the Gallery in Baltimore , Boston 's Faneuil Hall Marketplace , New York 's South Street Seaport , the Fashion Show Mall in Las Vegas , Alexandria 's Landmark Mall as well as Laurel Commons and Tysons Galleria .
General Growth 's problems can be traced partly to its debt - financed purchase in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2004">2004</TIMEX3> of Rouse , the pioneering developer of Columbia and of festival markets such as Harborplace .
