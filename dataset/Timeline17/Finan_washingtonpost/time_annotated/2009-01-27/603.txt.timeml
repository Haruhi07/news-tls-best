'' This Story : Read + | Watch + | LONDON , <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2009-01-26">Jan. 26</TIMEX3> -- Iceland 's coalition government collapsed <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2009-01-26">Monday</TIMEX3> , the first government to fall as a direct result of the global economic turmoil .
Prime Minister Geir Haarde said he and his cabinet would resign immediately .
As personal savings have been wiped out and joblessness has soared , Icelanders -- once among the world 's wealthiest people -- have taken to the streets in protest , banging pots and pans and throwing eggs and toilet paper at Haarde and other parliamentary leaders .
Protests have mounted throughout Europe , where the political backlash to the crisis is growing .
In Ireland , Britain , Spain and other countries where bankruptcies and home foreclosures are rising , polls show that approval ratings of leaders are sinking .
In Eastern Europe and Greece , where there is less of a government safety net , protesters have spilled onto the streets by the thousands .
<TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2008-12">Last month</TIMEX3> 's collapse of the Belgian government , which had been wrestling with long - standing conflicts , was also hastened by the banking crisis , analysts said .
Perhaps nowhere has the economic crash been more spectacular than Iceland , an island with 300,000 residents on the edge of the Arctic Circle .
<TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2008-FA">Last fall</TIMEX3> , its largest banks went bust and the value of its currency plummeted .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent days</TIMEX3> , protests intensified as no leader took responsibility for the crash , prompting police to use tear gas for the first time in half <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="P1CE">a century</TIMEX3> .
People felt that the government was ` ` playing the violin while the Titanic was sinking , '' best - selling Icelandic author Andri Sn r Magnason said in a telephone interview from Reykjavik , the capital .
` ` Everybody who has a loan is paying 20 percent interest , '' and even those who own modest homes find their salaries can not cover what is owed , he said .
Haarde announced <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2009-01-23">Friday</TIMEX3> that he would call early elections and said he would step down .
He cited health reasons and said doctors were treating him for cancer .
But ahead of those planned elections , Haarde 's Independence Party could not come to terms with the Social Democrats , its main partner in the two - year - old coalition that was scheduled to stay in power until <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3> .
The Social Democrats have called for the firing of the central bank governor and for closer ties with the rest of Europe .
The nation had purposefully sought to stay outside the European Union but <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> many believe that if Iceland had the euro as its currency instead of the krona , this crisis would not be so severe .
Foreign Minister Ingibjorg Gisladottir , head of the Social Democratic Alliance party , is expected to start talks immediately with smaller parties in an attempt to form a new government that would rule until the new election .
She has been receiving treatment for a brain tumor and said she does not want to be prime minister .
` ` Iceland is certainly leading the way of the social protests and the political fallouts , '' said Simon Johnson , former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund and senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington .
` ` I think it 's going to spread ; we 're in a phase <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> we 're beginning to see all the political fallout . ''
Simon Tilford , chief economist at the Center for European Reform , said the severity of the economic downturn in Britain has ` ` ended any chance '' that Gordon Brown 's Labor government will be reelected when he calls elections sometime before <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2010" mod="MID">mid-2010</TIMEX3> .
Iceland 's economy is forecast to shrink by almost 10 percent <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2009">this year</TIMEX3> .
Its banks , which had expanded into global powerhouses , had embraced risky investments that far exceeded the reserves of the nation 's central bank .
The country was forced to accept a bailout from the IMF .
