World economic leaders will gather in Washington <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2008-11-15">Saturday</TIMEX3> for a summit to address the global financial crisis .
It is no coincidence that Brazil , China , India and other emerging - market nations have not only been invited to the summit but are expected to play meaningful roles .
The credit crunch , which began in the United States , has quickly spread to the developing world .
The summit agenda will be dominated by monetary policy coordination and new roles for international institutions such as the International Monetary Fund .
In his <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2008-11-03">Nov. 3</TIMEX3> op - ed , ` ` Fairness for Emerging Markets , '' Kemal Dervis made the case for ` ` making massive credit lines available '' to most emerging - market economies .
But if we are to limit the depth of the looming global recession , trade finance must also be on the agenda .
Cross - border lending by banks based in developed countries fell at a record pace in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2008-Q2">the second quarter</TIMEX3> and continued its decline at an accelerated rate in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2008-Q3">the third quarter</TIMEX3> .
One casualty is the drying up of trade finance , the lifeblood of $ 14 trillion <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="SET" value="XXXX">annually</TIMEX3> in global commerce .
Wachovia 's <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> troubles , for example , have already led to a sharp reduction in short - term trade finance lines to Latin America .
Other banks are reassessing credit lines for trading with Asia , Africa and Eastern Europe .
The credit crisis has moved into trade finance as largely a funding problem .
If bank lines are shut off , it would be devastating for the economies of the developing world .
It would also have a boomerang effect on the United States and Europe , as key export markets -- and the jobs that go with them -- disappeared .
Fortunately , there are institutions already built to promote trade finance : export credit agencies .
The Export - Import Bank of the United States was established by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="1934">1934</TIMEX3> , in the midst of the Great Depression .
It is a ` ` lender of last resort '' that provides credit lines when private financial markets are not lending .
<TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2007">Last year</TIMEX3> , the bank authorized more than $ 12 billion in guarantees and insurance to support U.S. exporters .
Export credit agencies have helped mitigate a financial crisis before .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="1997" mod="END">late 1997</TIMEX3> , banks were unwilling to provide credit to Asia after currency and equity markets there plunged .
The U.S. Export - Import Bank confirmed letters of credit issued by 15 South Korean banks to support the purchase of raw materials and spare parts needed by Korean manufacturers .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="1998-02">February 1998</TIMEX3> , 20 official export credit agencies met in London to encourage each other to remain open and to offer new support to exports to Asia .
The U.S. Export - Import Bank played its part by initiating a new program for South Korea that month .
Within <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="P9M">nine months</TIMEX3> , it supported 2,460 transactions worth more than $ 1 billion for U.S. exporters to sell to Korean firms -LRB- up from only $ 40 million the year before -RRB- .
Similar trade credit programs were launched for Indonesia and Thailand .
These special short - term lending and trade credit insurance lines played a catalytic role in helping to build confidence in Asia at a critical time -- and helped the region rebound quickly .
None of the Korean banks defaulted , and the entire Export - Import Bank Korean program cost American taxpayers not one dime .
In the <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">coming days</TIMEX3> , the U.S. Export - Import Bank and other export credit agencies should take the lead in getting trade finance flowing again .
First , the export credit agencies should convene to share information and confirm credit availability for the pivotal months ahead .
The World Trade Organization has called a special meeting of trade finance players for <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2008-11-05">Wednesday</TIMEX3> , and the subject will be a major topic of discussion at <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2008-11-17">next Monday</TIMEX3> 's meeting of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development .
But <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2008-11-08">Saturday</TIMEX3> 's summit is the venue to push for decisive action .
Second , even though the Federal Reserve Bank 's discount window is <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> available to non - bank institutions , the volume of credit needed suggests it is crucial to find a way for the Export - Import Bank to fund asset - based lenders who support thousands of small suppliers in connection to exports .
The bank should institute a new and unprecedented , but temporary , program that provides short - term funding to intermediary lenders .
Third , with credit markets largely closed , traditional financing sources for medium - and long - term commercial export finance are not available .
The Export - Import Bank must revitalize its direct - lending programs , but in ways that continue to engage the institutional skills and delivery capabilities of commercial lenders .
It is critical for global prosperity that trade financing -- be it keeping credit lines open , oiling the trade supply chain or direct funding -- remain vibrant during the financial crisis .
A concerted effort by the U.S. Export - Import Bank and other export credit agencies can make a meaningful difference in how the real economy responds and recovers .
