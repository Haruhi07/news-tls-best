For Bailout Money , GMAC Agrees to End Deal With GM The auto financing giant GMAC relinquished its exclusive right to provide financing to people buying General Motors vehicles in exchange for up to $ 6 billion in federal aid .
The deal abruptly ends a 10 - year contract between GM and GMAC , according to the lender 's filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2009-01-02">yesterday</TIMEX3> .
In the past , whenever GM offered vehicle financing and leasing specials , such as below - market interest rates , it did so through GMAC .
The lender paid an annual fee to GM for the exclusivity and was required to meet sales targets .
<TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> , <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P2Y" mod="MORE_THAN">over the next two years</TIMEX3> , the automaker can offer incentive programs through other lenders under certain requirements , the filing said .
After that period , the terms will gradually loosen until <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2013">2013</TIMEX3> , when GM will have the right to offer programs through any lender -- including GMAC -- without any restrictions or limitations .
The agreement also releases GMAC from meeting specific sales targets and the obligation to provide leases .
` ` I do n't see anything negative in this new arrangement , as long as GMAC is still supportive of GM 's effort to sell cars , '' said Jack Fitzgerald , owner of Bethesda - based Fitzgerald Auto Malls .
The changes , effective <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2008-12-29">Monday</TIMEX3> , follow the Federal Reserve 's approval of GMAC to become a bank holding company , making the lender eligible for a slice of the Treasury Department 's $ 700 billion financial rescue package .
Chrysler Financial , that automaker 's credit arm , also has applied for aid under the Troubled Asset Relief Program .
<TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2009-01-02">Yesterday</TIMEX3> , Chrysler said it received a $ 4 billion loan from the Treasury through the auto rescue package signed into law by President Bush <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2008-W51">two weeks ago</TIMEX3> .
Under the GMAC deal , the government received 5 million preferred shares in GMAC that pay an 8 percent dividend -- a larger payout to taxpayers than the 5 percent dividend on its investments in banks -- in return for a $ 5 billion capital injection in the company .
Treasury said it would also lend up to $ 1 billion to GM so that the automaker would invest in the firm and support its reorganization .
The financial crisis has hit GMAC hard , and losses have mounted in both its mortgage and auto loan businesses .
Overall , GMAC lost $ 5.59 billion in <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="P3Q">the past three quarters</TIMEX3> .
Unable to find other funding sources and running low on cash , the finance arm shrunk its ability to make loans .
GM 's auto sales have suffered as a result .
Bank holding status gives GMAC a chance at survival by providing it with access to new sources of funding .

But , as a bank holding company , this wholly owned division will also need to change .
The Fed has required GM and Cerberus Capital Management , which own the lender , to divest a significant chunk of their ownership because commercial companies are not allowed to own banks .
<TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2009-W01">This week</TIMEX3> , the company showed signs of healing .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2008-12-30">Tuesday</TIMEX3> , GMAC said it would make car purchases easier by offering financing to customers with credit scores above 620 .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2008-12-31">Wednesday</TIMEX3> , it completed a complicated debt deal to raise cash needed to help it survive this historic auto sales slump .
But it fell short of its goal .
<TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2008-12-31">The same day</TIMEX3> , GM received an initial $ 4 billion of its $ 13.4 billion bailout from the government .
Despite this recovery , Fitzgerald said he worried that , as a bank holding company , GMAC might stray too far from its roots .
Captive financing companies like GMAC are critical to marketing vehicles in large volumes , he said .
` ` GM has had all the benefits that Ford Motor Credit provides to the Ford Motor Company , '' he said .
` ` If GMAC does all that , fine .
If it does n't , GM will have to create another GMAC of its own .
It 's just the way it is . ''
