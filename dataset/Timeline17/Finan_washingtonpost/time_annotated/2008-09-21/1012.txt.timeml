Looking for someone to blame for the shambles in U.S. financial markets ?
As someone who owns both an investment bank and commercial banks , and also runs a hedge fund , I have sat front and center and watched as this mess unfolded .
And in my view , there 's no need to look beyond Wall Street -- and the halls of power in Washington .
The former has created the nightmare by chasing obscene profits , and the latter have allowed it to spread by not practicing the oversight that is the federal government 's responsibility .
I find it hard to stomach the fact that investment banks that caused this financial crisis immediately ran to the government asking for assistance , which Bear Stearns received and Lehman Brothers , thankfully , did not .
This is one of many eerie parallels that the <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> meltdown bears to the Great Depression , when Washington and the taxpayers had to step up and take unprecedented action to stabilize the financial markets and the economy .
Unfortunately , the government <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2008-09-21">today</TIMEX3> has already put enormous taxpayer resources at risk -- bailing out investment firm Bear Stearns , mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and insurer AIG , and proposing to buy risky assets from the banking system -- to stop the economy from plummeting into another depression .
But these events only underscore the toxic relationship between Washington and Wall Street that has brought us to this point .
To understand the role of that relationship in our <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> troubles , let 's go back to <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="1999">1999</TIMEX3> .
That was when the hype about the Internet reached its pinnacle .
Technology spending by the government and corporations was booming as both sought to address economic and security fears surrounding the so - called Y2 K problem , a potential massive computer shutdown at the start of <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2000">the year 2000</TIMEX3> .
In the run - up to the millennium , the Federal Reserve , led by then - Chairman Alan Greenspan , began to pump money into the capital markets to deal with any financial problems that might arise from a Y2 K meltdown .
In the end , <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2000">2000</TIMEX3> arrived to nothing but a wonderful celebration .
But the monetary stimulus , coupled with the aforementioned hype , created an unfortunate bubble in Internet , technology and telecommunications stocks .
At the center of this bubble were the large Wall Street investment banks , which understood the profit potential in promoting the technology boom to overeager clients looking for the investment of a lifetime .
From <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="1999" mod="MID">mid-1999</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2000" mod="MID">mid-2000</TIMEX3> , Wall Street firms took approximately 500 companies public , raising a total of nearly $ 77 billion for these companies through initial public offerings , or IPOs .
For every IPO , the investment banks themselves earned an underwriting fee of 6 percent , returning them an enormous profit .
But apparently that was not enough for Wall Street .
As the middlemen between the insatiable investor demand for anything technology - related and young tech entrepreneurs needing to raise capital , the investment banks demanded the opportunity to invest in these companies before the public offerings , when the companies 's stocks were valued at a fraction of what they would bring post - IPO .
It was n't uncommon for Wall Street firms to invest tens of millions of dollars in ` ` anything.com '' before taking it public , charge a multimillion - dollar fee for the public offering and then watch their investment multiply within a matter of months .
Main Street investors , meanwhile , did not realize that the investment banks had essentially thrown away their underwriting guidelines , which had been in place since the Depression , to take companies public .
Among these guidelines were rules requiring that a company be in business for <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P5Y" mod="MORE_THAN">more than five years</TIMEX3> , be profitable for two or three consecutive years and have certain levels of revenue and profitability .

The business models of many of the companies that went public simply were n't viable .
Once the Internet bubble burst and the dust settled , America 's corporate landscape was littered with bankruptcies and mass layoffs , and investor losses have been estimated at more than $ 1 trillion .
In an effort to offset the economic strain from these losses , the Fed once again rapidly increased the money supply and slashed short - term interest rates to 1 percent -- a level that had n't been seen in <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="P45Y" mod="MORE_THAN">more than 45 years</TIMEX3> .
This enormous monetary stimulus -LRB- along with significant federal spending -RRB- energized the overall economy , but it also led to the greatest housing boom -- and possible bust -- this country has ever encountered .
From <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2002">2002</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2006">2006</TIMEX3> , housing values appreciated at an astounding rate of 16 percent per year .
It became impossible for the typical American family to buy an average - priced house using a conventional 30 - year fixed - rate mortgage .
Wall Street found another perfect opportunity to propel and take advantage of another forming bubble .
The result was the explosion of toxic new mortgage products that enticed homebuyers into supporting escalating housing prices while eliminating the need for the traditional 20 percent down payment .
Whether it was interest - only loans , low - or no - doc ` ` liar loans , '' or piggyback home - equity loans , the mortgage and banking industries found a way to place almost anyone with -- or even without -- a credit score into a home .
Wall Street played its part by packaging those mortgages into complex financial products and selling them to other investors , many of whom had no idea of what they were buying or the associated risks .
Once again , the investment banks raked in billions of dollars in fees , giving them incentive to keep lowering underwriting standards , allowing mortgage companies to originate and sell even the most unscrupulous home loans , which Wall Street then dumped onto the investment community .
Wall Street never once questioned the ethics of these activities ; it too was focused on the enormous rewards that allowed its firms to pay out an unfathomable $ 62 billion in bonuses in <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2006">2006</TIMEX3> alone .
Without Wall Street , the housing bubble would have ended shortly after the Fed started to raise interest rates in <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2004">2004</TIMEX3> , because no lenders would have originated these toxic mortgages if they had to keep the loans on their own balance sheets .
The price of all this greed ?
Sadly , because of the actions of the investment banks , the mortgage industry and the rating agencies , the investment community has <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> incurred an estimated $ 1 trillion and more in losses .
Even more troubling , housing prices have dropped 20 percent from their <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2006-07">July 2006</TIMEX3> highs , with the very real likelihood that housing could contract another 15 to 20 percent -- essentially wiping out more than $ 4 trillion in housing values .
This would be the biggest hit since the Depression to Americans ' most important asset .
What is even more remarkable is that at the same time , firms such as Goldman Sachs and Lehman not only made billions of dollars packaging and selling these toxic loans , they also wagered with their own capital that the values of these investments would decline , further raising their profits .
If any other industries engaged in such knowingly unscrupulous activities , there would be an immediate federal investigation .
Why is Washington so complicit in this intricate and lucrative affair ?
First , the Fed laid the groundwork for both these asset bubbles by lowering interest rates to historic lows .
In an attempt to protect his legacy after the Internet - bubble collapse , Greenspan provided unprecedented stimulus to re - inflate the economy and maintain his popularity with Wall Street .
-LRB- Remember the ` ` Greenspan put '' ?
-RRB-
But in doing so , he spawned the largest debt and asset bubble in U.S. history .
At the same time , federal regulatory agencies such as the SEC stood idly by as Wall Street took advantage of the investment public during both the Internet and the housing bubbles .
The SEC took almost no action against Wall Street after the dot - com implosion .
And in the midst of the housing bubble , in <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2006">2006</TIMEX3> , only the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency pushed for any level of regulation to address subprime lending .
One has to wonder why Treasury secretaries under Presidents Clinton and Bush -- Robert Rubin and Hank Paulson , respectively -- took no action to curb these abuses .
It certainly was not because they did not understand Wall Street 's practices -- both are former chief executives of Goldman Sachs .
And why has Congress been so silent ?
The Wall Street investment banking firms , their executives , their families and their political action committees contribute more to U.S. Senate and House campaigns than any other industry in America .
By sprinkling some of its massive gains into the pockets of our elected officials , Wall Street bought itself protection from any tough government enforcement .
This is no doubt the same reason why so many members of Congress were consistently blocking attempts to reform and downsize Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , which are essentially giant , undercapitalized hedge funds .
These two entities have been huge money machines for Democrats in both the House and the Senate , many of whom <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> had the gall to ask why these companies had n't been reformed in the past .
Nor should several Republican congressmen and Senators who likewise contributed to watering down legislation aimed at reforming these institutions be let off the hook .
Wall Street 's actions are <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> profoundly hurting American families , communities and the entire U.S. financial system .
People are being thrown out of their homes .
Once seemingly indestructible financial entities are succumbing to the crisis they have created and have jeopardized the stability of the global financial system .
Is n't it ironic that the same firms that preached free - market capitalism are <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> the ones begging for a taxpayer bailout ?
Many investment professionals operating in my world believe , as do I , that we are facing the greatest financial crisis since <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="1929">1929</TIMEX3> .
Fortunately , <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="2008-09-21">today</TIMEX3> we have safety nets , such as federal deposit insurance , that were non - existent during the Great Depression .
Yet there has not been a time since <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DATE" value="192">the 1920s</TIMEX3> when Wall Street has enjoyed as much influence over Washington as it has for <TIMEX3 tid="t37" type="DURATION" value="P12Y">the last 12 years</TIMEX3> .
Let 's hope that this influence fades rapidly -- and that this financial crisis does n't end the same way as the one of <TIMEX3 tid="t38" type="DATE" value="1928" mod="APPROX">nearly 80 years ago</TIMEX3> .
