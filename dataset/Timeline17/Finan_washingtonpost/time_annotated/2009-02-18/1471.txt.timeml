<TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2009-02-18">Wednesday</TIMEX3> , <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2009-02-18">February 18 , 2009</TIMEX3> ; <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="TIME" value="2009-02-18T10:18">10:18 AM</TIMEX3> The deep contraction in the economy and in the housing market has created devastating consequences for homeowners and communities throughout the country .
Millions of responsible families who make their <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="SET" value="XXXX-XX">monthly</TIMEX3> payments and fulfill their obligations have seen their property values fall , and are <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> unable to refinance at lower mortgage rates .
Millions of workers have lost their jobs or had their hours cut back , are <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> struggling to stay <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> on their mortgage payments with nearly 6 million households facing possible foreclosure .
Neighborhoods are struggling , as each foreclosed home reduces nearby property values by as much as 9 percent .
The Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan is part of the President 's broad , comprehensive strategy to get the economy back on track .
The plan will help up to 7 to 9 million families restructure or refinance their mortgages to avoid foreclosure .
In doing so , the plan not only helps responsible homeowners on the verge of defaulting , but prevents neighborhoods and communities from being pulled over the edge too , as defaults and foreclosures contribute to falling home values , failing local businesses , and lost jobs .
The key components of the Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan are : 1 .
Affordability : Provide Access to Low - Cost Refinancing for Responsible Homeowners Suffering From Falling Home Prices Enabling Up to 4 to 5 Million Responsible Homeowners to Refinance : Mortgage rates are <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> at historically low levels , providing homeowners with the opportunity to reduce their <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="SET" value="XXXX-XX">monthly</TIMEX3> payments by refinancing .
But under <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> rules , most families who owe more than 80 percent of the value of their homes have a difficult time refinancing .

Yet millions of responsible homeowners who put money down and made their mortgage payments on time have -- through no fault of their own -- seen the value of their homes drop low enough to make them unable to access these lower rates .
As a result , the Obama Administration is announcing a new program that will help as many as 4 to 5 million responsible homeowners who took out conforming loans owned or guaranteed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac to refinance through those two institutions .
Reducing <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="SET" value="XXXX-XX">Monthly</TIMEX3> Payments : For many families , a low - cost refinancing could reduce mortgage payments by thousands of dollars per year : Consider a family that took out a 30 - year fixed rate mortgage of $ 207,000 with an interest rate of 6.50 % on a house worth $ 260,000 at the time .
<TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2009-02-18">Today</TIMEX3> , that family has about $ 200,000 remaining on their mortgage , but the value of that home has fallen 15 percent to $ 221,000 -- making them ineligible for <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2009-02-18">today</TIMEX3> 's low interest rates that <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> generally require the borrower to have 20 percent home equity .
Under this refinancing plan , that family could refinance to a rate near 5.16 % -- reducing their annual payments by over $ 2,300 .
Stability : Create A $ 75 Billion Homeowner Stability Initiative to Reach Up to 3 to 4 Million At - Risk Homeowners Helping Hard - Pressed Homeowners Stay in their Homes : This initiative is intended to reach millions of responsible homeowners who are struggling to afford their mortgage payments because of the <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> recession , yet can not sell their homes because prices have fallen so significantly .
Millions of hard - working families have seen their mortgage payments rise to 40 or even 50 percent of their <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="SET" value="XXXX-XX">monthly</TIMEX3> income -- particularly those who received subprime and exotic loans with exploding terms and hidden fees .
The Homeowner Stability Initiative helps those who commit to make reasonable <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="SET" value="XXXX-XX">monthly</TIMEX3> mortgage payments to stay in their homes -- providing families with security and neighborhoods with stability .
No Aid for Speculators : This initiative will go solely to helping homeowners who commit to make payments to stay in their home it will not aid speculators or house flippers .
