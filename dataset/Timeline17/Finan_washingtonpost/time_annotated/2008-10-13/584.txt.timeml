Charles Platiau - AP -RRB- PARIS , <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DATE" value="2008-10-12">Oct. 12</TIMEX3> -- Governments around the world took unprecedented steps <TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="DATE" value="2008-10-12">Sunday</TIMEX3> to rescue the global financial system , with major European powers unveiling a united plan to prevent further bank failures while Australia and New Zealand moved to calm panicked investors by guaranteeing deposits before stock markets opened in Asia .
With the newly decisive moves , other major nations are catching up to or surpassing the United States in sculpting a response to the crisis , which crashed stock markets <TIMEX3 tid="t36" type="DATE" value="2008-W41">last week</TIMEX3> and is threatening a broader collapse of the world 's interconnected banking system .
Although Congress has given the Treasury Department wide authority to intervene in financial markets with a $ 700 billion bailout plan , officials are still trying to figure out how best to execute it .
<TIMEX3 tid="t38" type="TIME" value="2008-10-13TMO">This morning</TIMEX3> , Assistant Treasury Secretary Neel Kashkari , who has been tapped to orchestrate the bailout , is scheduled to give a speech in Washington on the giant rescue package .
In addition to Australia and New Zealand , the United Arab Emirates guaranteed all deposits with local banks <TIMEX3 tid="t39" type="DATE" value="2008-10-12">yesterday</TIMEX3> , including the country 's two largest lenders , Emirates NBD and National Bank of Abu Dhabi , to ensure that credit continues to flow .
This follows moves by some European countries , including Ireland and Germany , to remove or raise the limit on deposit insurance .
The United States also increased guarantees for banking deposits from $ 100,000 to $ 250,000 .
In Europe , where dissent over how to handle the crisis has added fuel to investor panic in <TIMEX3 tid="t40" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent weeks</TIMEX3> , leaders presented a unified response for the first time .
At an emergency summit of the 15 countries that use the euro , the continent 's major economic powers agreed <TIMEX3 tid="t43" type="DATE" value="2008-10-12">Sunday</TIMEX3> to offer government guarantees for troubled banks trying to raise funds and pledged that public money would be used aggressively to make sure no European bank is allowed to fail .
Europe 's vow to temporarily guarantee bank debt -- a measure aimed at restoring flows of credit between financial institutions afraid to lend to one another in the <TIMEX3 tid="t44" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> climate -- goes beyond what U.S. officials have promised .
The euro jumped 1.1 percent against the dollar in Asian trading <TIMEX3 tid="t46" type="DATE" value="2008-10-12" mod="END">late Sunday</TIMEX3> .
In a show of unity , British Prime Minister Gordon Brown joined leaders here for part of their meeting even though his country has not adopted the euro as its national currency .
Brown planned to announce <TIMEX3 tid="t47" type="DATE" value="2008-10-13">Monday</TIMEX3> an $ 86 billion package of credit guarantees and bank - recapitalization plans that many are calling a partial nationalization of the British financial system .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t49" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent days</TIMEX3> , the U.S. Treasury has also shifted toward a plan to have the government infuse capital in exchange for part - ownership .
The <TIMEX3 tid="t52" type="DATE" value="2008-10-12">Sunday</TIMEX3> Times reported that Brown 's package would include the government taking a majority share in the Royal Bank of Scotland and the Halifax Bank of Scotland , two of Britain 's largest banks .
Officials in Paris said the Europe - wide plan adopted by the 15 countries in the euro group was inspired by British measures , suggesting that Europeans were also ready to buy into troubled banks heavily to prevent them from failing .
` ` This is indeed a common action that we are taking , '' French President Nicolas Sarkozy , who holds the European Union 's rotating presidency , said in announcing the accord at the Elysee Palace .
The agreement was only a framework -- ` ` principles and orientations , '' according to Jean - Claude Trichet , head of the European Central Bank -- and each government planned to take specific steps on a national level , according to its own interpretation of what should be done to bolster its banks , Sarkozy said .
In that regard , the outcome was similar to an agreement reached <TIMEX3 tid="t53" type="DATE" value="2008-10-11">Saturday</TIMEX3> in Washington by finance ministers of the Group of Seven industrial nations .
Sarkozy also called a special meeting of his government for <TIMEX3 tid="t55" type="TIME" value="2008-10-13TMO">Monday morning</TIMEX3> to outline his country 's plans .
