<TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2009-02-11">Wednesday</TIMEX3> , <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2009-02-11">February 11 , 2009</TIMEX3> ; <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="TIME" value="2009-02-11T17:18">5:18 PM</TIMEX3> The Office of Thrift Supervision <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2009-02-11">today</TIMEX3> called for the mortgage lenders it regulates to halt foreclosures until the Obama administration puts in place a program to help struggling homeowners .
After presenting a plan to boost the financial sector <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2009-02-10">yesterday</TIMEX3> , Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said that a $ 50 billion initiative to help homeowners facing foreclosure is not expected for <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P1W" mod="EQUAL_OR_MORE">at least a week</TIMEX3> .
The delay and the price tag -- it was the low end of expectations -- disappointed consumer advocates and lawmakers anticipating the announcement .
OTS is joining consumer advocates and some in Congress , including Rep. Barney Frank -LRB-
D - Mass .
-RRB- , chairman of the House Financial Services Committee , who have called for lenders to institute a moratorium on foreclosures in the meantime .
This adds to the pressure facing the administration as it finalizes details of the plan amid growing frustration about the ineffectiveness of government and industry efforts to stem foreclosures .
Geithner and Shaun Donovan , secretary the Department of Housing and Urban Development , also met with more than two dozen officials from large banks , nonprofit groups and industry groups <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2009-02-11">today</TIMEX3> to discuss foreclosure prevention plans .
The discussion , held at the Department of Treasury , lasted for <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="PT1H">more than an hour</TIMEX3> .
` ` The thing that was striking was the uniformity of support for the idea that we can no longer rely on a voluntary system '' under which the financial services industry leads the foreclosure prevention effort , said John Taylor , president of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition .
There was also strong support for a program to have the government buy troubled mortgages held by lenders at a discount and put the borrowers through a modification program , he said .
` ` I know that is going to cost some people some money , but the truth is the foreclosures keep driving us further into this recession , '' said Taylor .
Government officials have said the new loan modification program would be a ` ` more aggressive version '' of the one launched <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2008" mod="END">late last year</TIMEX3> by mortgage financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
That program has been criticized for not going far enough to help homeowners .
` ` We want to get a plan <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">as soon as possible</TIMEX3> because the delay is causing homeowners to suffer even more than they have , '' said Pam Banks , policy counsel for Consumers Union .
` ` Time is of the essence . ''
The temporary moratorium being called for by OTS may be beneficial since the administration 's plan could provide assistance to lenders that modify troubled loans , said Bob Davis , executive vice president for the American Bankers Association , an industry group .
` ` I view this is a prudent reminder to banks that a new solution may be coming , '' he said .
ING Direct , one of the largest thrifts regulated by OTS , said it already has a moratorium in place through <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2009-03" mod="END">the end of March</TIMEX3> .
` ` We 're not living under normal circumstances and we have to act differently and help everybody to get by as well as possible , '' said Cathy MacFarlane , a company spokesman .
<TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2008">Last year</TIMEX3> , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac temporarily suspended foreclosures during the holiday season so more people could be included in the loan modification program they had unveiled .
Fannie Mae extended its moratorium for owner - occupied properties through <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="2009-02" mod="END">the end of this month</TIMEX3> and said it has been able to help about 13 percent of the thousands of homeowners that were scheduled for foreclosure during the moratorium .
OTS regulates more than 800 savings and loans across the country , including American Bank in Rockville and First Market Bank in Virginia .
` ` OTS - regulated institutions would be supporting the national imperative to combat the economic crisis by suspending foreclosures until the new plan takes hold , '' John Reich , the agency 's director , said in a statement .
The foreclosure rate has been rising and appears to be accelerating as the recession deepens .
As housing prices continue to plummet , lawmakers are also considering legislation to allow bankruptcy judges to modify loans , including lowering the principal owed on the mortgage to the <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> value of the home .
