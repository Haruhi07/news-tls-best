The swine flu outbreak is compounding the ailments of the global economy just as it is starting to stabilize , darkening the outlook for everything from tourism to world trade , particularly in the United States and Mexico .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent weeks</TIMEX3> , economic data suggested a bottoming - out of the global financial crisis .
But economists <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2009-04-27">yesterday</TIMEX3> were forced to digest worst - case scenarios in which a recession that is already the deepest since World War II could become two or three times as painful .
That would be the consequence of a full - blown flu pandemic .

But even if the outbreak were to remain relatively contained , economists warned of a new round of woes .
Underscoring those concerns , airline stocks plunged <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2009-04-27">yesterday</TIMEX3> amid fears of a replay of what happened <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="200" mod="START">earlier this decade</TIMEX3> in Asia , when outbreaks of bird flu and severe acute respiratory syndrome , known as SARS , emptied hotels and led to flight cancellations .
The value of the Mexican peso took its steepest drop since <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2008-11">November</TIMEX3> .
And investors drove down the price of oil by 2.7 percent on fears that swine flu would slow global economic recovery .

But the real focus of concern centered on a new dose of the last thing the world economy needs <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3> -- more uncertainty .
` ` The impact is to threaten the stabilization of the global downturn we ' ve been seeing <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="PXW" mod="MORE_THAN">over the last few weeks</TIMEX3> , '' said Brian Dolan , chief currency strategist for Forex.com .
` ` The timing could not be worse . ''
The damage could hit the already ailing tourism and airline industries the hardest .
The European Union and a number of nations began warning their citizens <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2009-04-27">yesterday</TIMEX3> to avoid unnecessary travel to parts of North America .
During the SARS outbreak in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2003">2003</TIMEX3> -- the last major epidemic of a respiratory disease with human - to - human transmission -- airline traffic to Asian destinations such as Hong Kong fell by as much as 60 percent .
Overall , Asia - Pacific airlines lost 50 percent of traffic in the first <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="P5M">five months</TIMEX3> of <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2003">2003</TIMEX3> , causing them $ 6 billion in losses .
North American carriers saw passenger traffic fall by 3.7 percent that year .
This time , however , the global airline industry is already in deep crisis , raising the specter that deep losses could lead to forced consolidations or even requests for government bailouts .
Though carriers have reported only limited cancellations so far , Continental Airlines saw its shares dive 16 percent <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2009-04-27">yesterday</TIMEX3> , while United Airlines , Delta Air Lines and American Airlines saw declines of around 14 percent .
With a number of nations from Spain to New Zealand reporting confirmed cases of swine flu , and countries including Russia and Taiwan moving to quarantine travelers showing flu - like symptoms , even Asian and European airline shares saw sharp sell - offs .
The outbreak is also affecting trade .
Russia , China and the Philippines , citing swine flu , suspended pork imports from Mexico and some U.S. states where the virus has been detected , despite the fact that health officials say there is no link between pork consumption and the virus .

With trade barriers already on the rise because of the global downturn , other nations could pile on .
Though Mexico 's pork industry could suffer from any new bans , the impact of such restrictions in the United States is less clear .
Russia , for instance , is the fifth largest importer of U.S. pork , but since most U.S. production comes from states that have so far not confirmed cases of swine flu , industry leaders said there would be little immediate disruption .
That said , they warned that Russia could extend the ban , and that other nations might follow suit .
` ` The concern is that regardless of the scientific evidence , other countries could use this as an excuse to restrict our exports , '' said David Warner , a spokesman for the U.S. National Pork Producers Council .
` ` Everyone is looking to protect their own <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3> . ''
The economic impact of the outbreak could be amplified by the financial crisis , especially in Mexico , where restaurants and shopping malls were already closing in the capital , eating further into plunging retail sales .
When SARS struck , by comparison , the global economy was in a period of broad expansion .
The outbreak , according to the Asian Development Bank , cost East and Southeast Asian nations overall about 0.6 percent in economic growth in <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2003">2003</TIMEX3> .
This time , however , the global economy is anything but robust , magnifying potential new strains .
The impact in the United States would be far greater in the case of a larger - scale pandemic , with the worst - case scenario akin to what happened during the Spanish flu of <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="1918">1918</TIMEX3> , which killed tens of millions of people worldwide .
A <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2006">2006</TIMEX3> report from the Congressional Budget Office estimated a pandemic , depending on its severity , could cost the United States between 1 percent to 4.1 percent of annual economic output .
Given that the U.S. economy is expected to shrink by 2.8 percent <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2009">this year</TIMEX3> , a pandemic could lead to a contraction of 3.9 percent to 6.9 percent as consumer demand and worker productivity suffer further .
