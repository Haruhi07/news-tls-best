Congress 's Afterthought , Wall Street 's Trillion Dollars Sen. Christopher J. Dodd -LRB- D - Conn .
-RRB- authored the <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="1991">1991</TIMEX3> legislation , which was requested by Wall Street .

On the day before <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2008-11-27">Thanksgiving</TIMEX3> in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="1991">1991</TIMEX3> , the U.S. Senate voted to vastly expand the emergency powers of the Federal Reserve .
The critical language was contained in a single , somewhat inscrutable sentence , and the only public explanation was offered during a final debate that began with a reminder that senators had airplanes to catch .

Yet , in removing a long - standing prohibition on loans that supported financial speculation , the provision effectively allowed the Fed for the first time to lend money to Wall Street during a crisis .
That authority , which sat unused for <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P16Y" mod="MORE_THAN">more than 16 years</TIMEX3> , <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> provides the legal basis for the Fed 's unprecedented efforts to rescue the financial system .
Since <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2008-03">March 2008</TIMEX3> , the central bank 's board of governors has invoked its emergency powers at least 19 times : to contain the wreckage of Bear Stearns and ease the fall of American International Group , to preserve Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley , to limit losses at Bank of America and Citigroup , to lend more than $ 1 trillion .
The repeated use of the once - dusty law has surprised and alarmed a wide range of people , including economists and members of Congress .
It has even raised worries among presidents of the regional banks that make up the Federal Reserve system .
Many critics are concerned that an institution not accountable to voters is risking vast amounts of public money and choosing which companies get help .
Others are concerned that the Fed 's new role will interfere with its basic responsibility for regulating economic growth .
There is also a question about the roots of the crisis : Did investment banks take greater risks in <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="P2DE">the past two decades</TIMEX3> because they knew the Fed could rescue them ?
The <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="1991">1991</TIMEX3> legislation , authored by Sen. Christopher J. Dodd -LRB- D - Conn .
-RRB- , was requested by Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street firms in the wake of the <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="1987">1987</TIMEX3> market crisis , and it would save some of them a generation later .
Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke and other leaders of the central bank have argued that the emergency authority has allowed it to rescue the financial system and that without it , the economy would be in far worse shape .

And they argue that they are using the power as Congress intended .
` ` This provision was designed as a last resort to make sure credit flows when times are tough and credit is n't being extended , '' said Scott Alvarez , the Fed 's general counsel .
` ` That 's exactly what it 's being used for <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2009-05-30">today</TIMEX3> . ''
Rep. Barney Frank -LRB-
D - Mass .
-RRB- , chairman of the House Financial Services Committee , said that the actions taken by the Fed have been necessary and important but that those actions should have been taken by an agency accountable to voters .
He said he was not aware of the Fed 's emergency power until <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2008-09">September</TIMEX3> , and he favored removing much of that authority from the Fed once the crisis has passed .
