The world 's petro
- powers -- the oil - exporting nations armed with vast , high - priced crude reserves -- are looking a little less imposing <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> that prices are tumbling .
Instead of flexing their financial muscle abroad , cash - rich oil exporters have been forced to bolster institutions at home , spending billions of dollars to prop up banks , currencies , stock markets and other aspects of their economies .
Around the world , oil price shock has given way to aftershock .
<TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2008-10-23">Yesterday</TIMEX3> , crude oil prices briefly touched a 16 - month low before closing at $ 67.84 a barrel , up $ 1.09 but less than half their <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2008-07">July</TIMEX3> peak as traders worried that a global economic slowdown will shrink demand for petroleum products .
For oil exporters , the price decline has compounded the global financial crisis .
Kazakhstan has raided its once sacrosanct national oil fund to bolster banks that borrowed from abroad ; Iran , which drained much of its rainy day fund to pump up its economy even before oil prices fell , is <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> having trouble financing oil and gas development projects ; Venezuela might run a deficit to pay for massive social spending ; Mexico has spent billions of dollars defending the peso ; and Russia , Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have dipped into their cash hoards to rescue domestic financial institutions .
The sudden change in fortune will dominate the agenda at <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2008-10-24">today</TIMEX3> 's emergency meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ; the 13 - member cartel that is expected to slash output by 1 million to 2 million barrels <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> to stop the slide in oil prices .
` ` The meeting <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2008-W43">this week</TIMEX3> shows they 're concerned and they need to micromanage -LRB- output -RRB- some more , '' said Fareed Mohamedi , head of country strategies at PFC Energy , a Washington consulting firm .
To members of OPEC , this moment recalls the Asian financial crisis in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="1997">1997</TIMEX3> , when the oil cartel increased production to ease international economic pressures only to see oil prices collapse .
<TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> , in a new economic crisis , OPEC members will only be debating how big a cutback is needed .
There is , however , no need to pass the tin cup for oil exporting countries , analysts note .
The six members of the Gulf Cooperation Council have $ 2 trillion of financial reserves .
Russia 's and Kazakhstan 's financial reserves are big enough , for <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> , to stave off the kind of crisis that shook both nations in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="1998">1998</TIMEX3> .
Even populous and impoverished Nigeria has paid off foreign debts and built up reserves .
Moreover , the average oil price has still been higher than in <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2007">the previous year</TIMEX3> , according to OPEC .
Kuwait 's finance ministry said <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2008-W42">last week</TIMEX3> that it had collected $ 54 billion in revenue in <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2008-H1">the first half</TIMEX3> of the year , more than it had anticipated for the entire year .
The spike in prices has also happened so quickly that oil exporting nations have n't had time to raise the price assumptions used for spending plans .
The Saudi <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> budget assumes prices between $ 40 and $ 45 a barrel .
` ` Many of these countries were much more prudent than they were in past , '' said Robin West , chairman of PFC Energy .
As a result , he said , most oil exporters ` ` are still in pretty good cash positions for <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> . ''
The biggest exceptions are Iran and Venezuela , two of the Bush administration 's main adversaries .
