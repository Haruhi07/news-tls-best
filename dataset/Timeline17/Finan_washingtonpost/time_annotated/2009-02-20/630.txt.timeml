The global financial crisis is bringing out the worst in the trade relationship between the United States and China .
U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner accused China of ` ` manipulating '' its currency , vowing in written testimony submitted for his confirmation hearing that the United States would act ` ` aggressively '' to remedy the situation .
The U.S. Trade Representative 's office , in a harshly worded and wide - ranging complaint to the World Trade Organization in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2008-12">December</TIMEX3> , alleged that China uses cash grants , cheap loans and other subsidies to illegally aid its exporters .
China , for its part , has bashed the ` ` Buy America '' program embedded in the just - passed stimulus package , calling it ` ` poison to the solution '' of the global economic crisis .
At the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2009-W05">three weeks ago</TIMEX3> , Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao , without naming the United States explicitly , blamed the financial crisis on unsupervised capitalism .
` ` The crisis has pushed the China - U.S. relationship to a flash point .
From <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> on , it will either become more stable or more confrontational , '' said Mei Xinyu , a trade expert with the Chinese Commerce Ministry 's research arm .
When Hillary Rodham Clinton arrives in China on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2009-02-20">Friday</TIMEX3> as part of her first diplomatic visit as secretary of state , she said she hopes to broaden the bilateral dialogue to include climate change and human rights .

But it is economic cooperation that will be at the forefront of many people 's minds .
Both the United States and China , the world 's No . 1 and No . 3 largest economies , have railed about the dangers of economic protectionism , but so far both have been guilty , according to the other , of practicing it .
` ` While both countries have come to an agreement that trade protectionism should n't be practiced by any country , when it comes to the details -- maybe due to domestic reasons -- they may feel pressured toward it , '' said Jia Qingguo , the vice dean of Peking University 's international studies school .
Li Wei , a researcher at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation , said ` ` the purpose of ` Buy America ' is clearly to kick out foreign competitors . ''
In the United States , industry groups are pushing for more action against China , saying it is trying to export its way out of the crisis by dumping cheap products abroad .
The latest figures , released in mid - <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2009-02">February</TIMEX3> , show that the U.S. trade deficit with China hit at an all - time high of $ 266.3 billion in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> , the worst imbalance ever recorded with any country .
It came as the overall trade deficit shrank for the year and hit its lowest levels in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P6Y">six years</TIMEX3> in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2008-12">December</TIMEX3> amid depressed demand for imports .
U.S. steel and textile manufacturers have been especially loud in their call for the Obama administration to be more aggressive with Beijing .
The U.S. International Trade Commission has imposed duties of 35 to 40 percent on some steel products from China -- imports hit an all - time high <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2009-FA">this fall</TIMEX3> -- to counteract Chinese subsidies .
The textile lobby has accused China of increasing its share of the U.S. apparel market to more than 50 percent <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2009">this year</TIMEX3> by using export subsidies .
The <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2008-12-19">Dec. 19</TIMEX3> WTO petition filed by the USTR addresses some of these concerns ; a WTO official said the complaint is still being reviewed .
