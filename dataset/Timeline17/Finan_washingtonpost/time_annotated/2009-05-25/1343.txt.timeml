In France , Social Programs Shield Many From Economic Downturn MENTON , France -- In <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent years</TIMEX3> , Jean Beaufranqui and his wife have spent most of their time in Menton , enjoying the sunshine and gentle Mediterranean breezes that have made this little town into a retirement haven , France 's version of Miami Beach .
And <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> , even as the world reels from its most painful economic crisis since <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="193">the 1930s</TIMEX3> , Beaufranqui 's thoughts have turned not to budget cuts but to buying an apartment here and settling in full time .
As a retiree -- he stopped working <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="1990" mod="APPROX">almost 19 years ago</TIMEX3> , at the standard age of 60 -- the former metallurgist has sailed smoothly through the economic storm as the French government regularly deposited his <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="SET" value="XXXX-XX">monthly</TIMEX3> pension payments .
` ` Not really , '' he responded when asked whether the financial crisis had affected his standard of living , a question that seemed to interest him less than the petanque bowling tournament he was watching from a park bench beside the beach .
For Beaufranqui and millions of other French people dependent on tax - financed largess , this country 's cozy social protections , vast numbers of bureaucrats and unhesitating government intervention have proved to be a shelter from want in these hard economic times .
Denounced for decades as a millstone preventing growth and competitiveness , particularly by free - market advocates in the United States , the French government 's dominant role in economic activity has suddenly found new favor at home and grudging respect abroad .
The crisis has landed hard in France , just as it has elsewhere .
European Union specialists estimated <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2009-W21">last week</TIMEX3> that the number of unemployed is likely to rise to more than 3 million by <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2010">next year</TIMEX3> as factories close .

But the French economy is expected to shrink by just 3 percent , markedly less than in Britain or Italy , largely because of the country 's traditionally high level of government spending , they added .
More significant in human terms , broad sectors of the population -- bureaucrats , retirees , teachers and the millions of others whose livelihood depends directly or indirectly on public outlays -- find themselves surrounded by a government cushion .
The effects are easy to see : As the crisis grew and began to obsess French officialdom in Paris , for instance , Alpine ski resorts reported full bookings for <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2009-WI">the winter</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2009-SP">spring</TIMEX3> seasons .
Perhaps nowhere has the buffer effect been more evident than in Menton , a Riviera town where a third of the population is retired and the largest employers -- City Hall , the hospital and a municipal casino just off the beach -- are government - run .
Mayor Jean - Claude Guibal , who also represents Menton in the National Assembly , said the city has suffered no large layoffs in the economic crisis for the simple reason that it has no factories to lose ; service jobs catering to retired people have endured .
` ` The retired people constitute an element of stability , '' Guibal said in an interview in City Hall , at the top of a square sloping toward the sea , shaded by palm trees and ringed by cafe terraces under stucco arcades .
The crisis has been felt here , of course .
Fabrice Massiere , a cheese merchant at the Menton Market , said his business was off sharply because the number of visitors has declined .
Guibal said income from the casino and tax revenue on real estate transactions have sunk , forcing him to raise property taxes for the first time in <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DURATION" value="P13Y">13 years</TIMEX3> .

But the heavy dependence on government subsidies or official salaries , he added , has put an economic fence around a large part of the Menton region 's 66,000 inhabitants .
` ` This makes us less sensitive to the fluctuations of the world economy , '' said Guibal , who described himself as a free - market advocate and a member of President Nicolas Sarkozy 's pro - business coalition .
Sarkozy , a free - market champion who was elected in <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2007">2007</TIMEX3> on a pledge to help France ` ` work more and earn more , '' has insisted the crisis will not deter him from trying to reduce the government 's involvement in the economy .
A senior aide , Henri Guaino , said in a television interview <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2009-05">this month</TIMEX3> , for instance , that Sarkozy will continue to replace only half of the bureaucrats who retire from ministries and other government agencies .
