Obama Says Economic Crisis Comes First President Obama declared <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="TIME" value="2009-02-09TNI">last night</TIMEX3> in his first prime - time news conference that the task of saving and creating jobs is more important than cultivating the bipartisan cooperation he promised to bring to Washington , and he pressed his case for the massive economic stimulus plan working its way through Congress .
Warning that inaction could ` ` turn a crisis into a catastrophe , '' Obama rejected criticism from Republicans about the legislation 's effect on the federal deficit , noting that government debt had ballooned on his predecessor 's watch .
Although he called for lawmakers to break out of their ` ` ideological rigidity , '' he was unapologetic as he pushed a package with a cost of more than $ 800 billion that has so far drawn only nominal Republican support .
` ` I ca n't afford to see Congress play the usual political games .
What we have to do <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3> is deliver for the American people , '' Obama said just hours after the legislation narrowly cleared a key procedural hurdle in the Senate , where it is likely to gain final passage <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2009-02-10">today</TIMEX3> .
The bill will then become the subject of potentially contentious negotiations between House and Senate leaders .
It is unclear whether it will reach the president 's desk before a scheduled congressional recess <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2009-W08">next week</TIMEX3> .
Obama repeatedly stressed the need for swift and aggressive action on the economy , pitting his plan against those who he said would ` ` do nothing '' to assist a desperate public .
` ` So , you know , we can differ on some of the particulars , but again , the question I think that the American people are asking is : Do you just want government to do nothing , or do you want it to do something ?

If you want it to do something , then we can have a conversation , '' he said .
` ` But doing nothing -- that 's not an option , from my perspective . ''
Obama defended the role of government in the recovery process , saying that ` ` with the private sector so weakened by this recession , the federal government is the only entity left with the resources to jolt our economy back to life . ''
The president fielded 13 questions from reporters in his first wide - ranging session since he took office , touching briefly on foreign policy , his long - range agenda and sports .

But the economy dominated the event .
Asked about the next allotment of money to aid troubled banks , he said he is dissatisfied with the way the first $ 350 billion was spent .
` ` We did n't get as big a bang for the buck as we should have '' from the Troubled Assets Relief Program , Obama said .
` ` My immediate task is making sure that <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-H2">the second half</TIMEX3> of that money -- $ 350 billion -- is spent properly . ''
That allocation process will begin <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2009-02-10">today</TIMEX3> , when Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner is slated to detail the administration 's strategy for releasing the remaining bailout money .
Obama stepped to the podium in the East Room of the White House at <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="TIME" value="2009-02-10T20:01">8:01 p.m.</TIMEX3> , opening with prepared remarks on the economy that set the tone for the night .
Somber and focused , he alternated between defending some specific provisions of the legislation and discussing its broad framework , repeatedly arguing that the public would prefer even a flawed government response over inaction .
He said he thought an economic recovery could begin to set in by <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3> but warned that <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3> will continue to be a ` ` difficult year . ''
He did not crack any jokes , aside from a playful greeting of veteran reporter Helen Thomas , and ended the appearance promptly at <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="TIME" value="2009-02-10T21:00">9 p.m.</TIMEX3> Still , the president conveyed a firm tone .
Asked whether he risked appearing to be too much of an alarmist about the economic peril facing the United States , possibly undermining public confidence in the system , he became almost defensive .
` ` No , no , no , no , '' he said .
` ` I think that what I ' ve said is what other economists have said across the political spectrum , which is that if you delay acting on an economy of this severity , then you potentially create a negative spiral that becomes much more difficult for us to get out of . ''
He compared the situation to that of Japan in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="199">the 1990s</TIMEX3> , saying the Japanese , failing to act quickly enough , suffered a ` ` lost decade . ''
` ` This is not your ordinary , run - of - the - mill recession , '' he said .
In a brief foray into foreign policy , Obama said with regard to Iran that the administration ` ` will be looking for openings that can be created where we can start sitting across the table , face - to - face diplomatic overtures '' with the Islamic republic .
He said that ` ` there 's been a lot of mistrust built up over the years , so it 's not going to happen overnight '' and that ` ` even as we engage in this direct diplomacy , we are very clear about certain deep concerns '' about Iranian links to militant groups and possible pursuit of a nuclear weapon .
In stark contrast to former president George W. Bush , Obama did not say that the United States would refuse to tolerate a nuclear - armed Iran .

Instead ,
he all but invited Iran to signal that it , too , is interested in talks .
` ` <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> it 's time for Iran to send some signals that it wants to act differently , as well , and recognize that , even as it has some rights as a member of the international community , with those rights come responsibilities , '' he said .
The news conference ended <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> of action on the stimulus package : Obama traveled to Elkhart , Ind. , to promote the legislation as it made its way toward the Senate floor , clearing a procedural hurdle by a vote of 61 to 36 that set the stage for final passage <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2009-02-10">today</TIMEX3> .
Only three Republicans -- moderate Sens . Susan Collins and Olympia J. Snowe of Maine and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania -- supported the legislation .
In the House , no Republicans voted for the $ 819 billion version of the stimulus package that passed on <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2009-01-28">Jan. 28</TIMEX3> .
