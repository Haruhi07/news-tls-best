Director of National Intelligence Dennis C. Blair told Congress <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2009-02-12">yesterday</TIMEX3> that instability in countries around the world caused by the <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> global economic crisis , rather than terrorism , is the primary near - term security threat to the United States .
` ` Roughly a quarter of the countries in the world have already experienced low - level instability such as government changes because of the <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> slowdown , '' Blair told the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence , delivering the first annual threat assessment in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P6Y">six years</TIMEX3> in which terrorism was not presented as the primary danger to this country .
Making his first appearance before the panel as President Obama 's top intelligence adviser , Blair said the most immediate fallout from the worldwide economic decline for the United States will be ` ` allies and friends not being able to fully meet their defense and humanitarian obligations . ''
He also saw the prospect of possible refugee flows from the Caribbean to the United States and a questioning of American economic and financial leadership in the world .
But Blair also raised the specter of the ` ` high levels of violent extremism '' in the turmoil of <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="192">the 1920s</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="193">1930s</TIMEX3> along with ` ` regime - threatening instability '' if the economic crisis persists over a one - to - two - year period .
In answer to a question about whether he was shifting assets to cover the financial downturn , Blair said that by leading off with the economic situation he ` ` was trying to act as your intelligence officer <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2009-02-13">today</TIMEX3> , telling you what I thought the Senate ought to be caring about . ''
He said he was not refocusing the intelligence community 's basic collection and analytic work from traditional concerns such as terrorism , Afghanistan , Pakistan , Iran , North Korea , Russia and China .
In fact , during the nearly two - hour hearing , Blair took lawmakers on a virtual tour of every other major and minor security threat , from terrorism and cyber - attacks to the country 's evolving relations with Russia and China .
Discussing terrorism , Blair emphasized the progress being made against al - Qaeda .
` ` We have seen notable progress in Muslim opinion turning against terrorist groups such as al - Qaeda '' as more religious leaders question terrorists ' use of brutal tactics against fellow Muslims .
He said that ` ` al - Qaeda <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2009-02-13">today</TIMEX3> is less capable and effective than it was <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2008-02-13">a year ago</TIMEX3> '' based on the pressure the U.S. , Pakistan and others put on Osama bin Laden and his core leadership in Pakistan 's tribal areas and the decline of al - Qaeda in Iraq .
He also reported that while no major country faces the risk of collapse at the hands of any terrorist groups , ` ` Pakistan and Afghanistan have to work hard to repulse a still serious threat '' to their governments .
Despite these successes , Blair said al - Qaeda and its affiliates and allies ` ` remain dangerous and adaptive enemies , '' and the threat continues that they could inspire or orchestrate an attack on the United States or Europe .
He told the committee there is still concern that al - Qaeda could inspire some homegrown terrorists inside the United States .
He added that if al - Qaeda is forced out of the Pakistan tribal areas , it will have difficulty supporting the Taliban in Afghanistan .
He said bin Laden could relocate .
For example , he said , al - Qaeda elements in Yemen <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> pose a new threat to Saudi Arabia , whose own efforts have been successful in killing or capturing most al - Qaeda senior leaders in that country .
Blair delivered a blunt assessment of Iran and its weapons programs , saying that it is possible that Tehran could develop a nuclear weapon as early as <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2010">next year</TIMEX3> , if the country 's leaders choose to do so .
But he also suggested that Iran could be kept off the nuclear path with the right combination of diplomacy and economic pressure .
` ` Iran is clearly developing all the components of a deliverable nuclear weapons program , '' he said , but ` ` whether they take it all the way to nuclear weapons depends a great deal on their internal decisions . ''
Blair described Iraq as increasingly stable , with terrorist attacks on the wane and al - Qaeda losing followers and influence .
But he warned that <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> progress could be undermined by tribal disputes , corruption and foreign support for militia groups .
Echoing <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> statements by U.S. military commanders , he gave a grim portrayal of security in Afghanistan , where Taliban insurgents have shown new aggressiveness while the government continues to struggle with rampant corruption and an extensive drug trade .
In neighboring Pakistan , an intensified campaign against terrorists has failed to subdue multiple insurgencies or quell growing radicalism in many parts of the country .
