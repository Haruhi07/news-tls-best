Florida - based BankUnited collapsed <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2009-05-21">yesterday</TIMEX3> , the largest bank failure so far <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2009">this year</TIMEX3> , as a new federal investigation revealed that the bank 's regulator , the Office of Thrift Supervision , allowed the firm to cover up its financial weakness .
A consortium of investors , including District - based private - equity giant Carlyle Group , agreed to buy and recapitalize BankUnited , the fourth - largest bank to fail since the onset of the financial crisis .
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said it expects to absorb $ 4.9 billion in losses .
It is the second major bank failure involving allegations that OTS , the primary regulator of banks that concentrate in mortgage lending , allowed a bank to obscure its problems from investors .
OTS has previously acknowledged allowing IndyMac , which failed <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2008-SU">last summer</TIMEX3> , to conceal its problems in a financial filing .

A report <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2009-05-21">yesterday</TIMEX3> by the Treasury Department 's inspector general accused OTS of permitting three more banks to file misleading reports about their financial condition .
In the case of Coral Gables - based BankUnited , OTS had ordered the company to raise additional capital and it had been unable to meet a deadline to do so , the report said .
OTS 's senior deputy director allowed the company to raise the money after the deadline and then to issue a financial report stating that the money had been raised before the deadline , the report said .
The inspector general 's report describes BankUnited 's case but does not name the senior deputy director .
The inspector general 's office confirmed the bank was BankUnited .
Scott Polakoff was the only senior deputy director at OTS during the period .
Polakoff stepped down <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2009">this year</TIMEX3> from his position as acting director of the agency after the inspector general brought his actions to the attention of Treasury officials .
` ` We consider these matters very serious and find it alarming , '' the inspector general wrote in the report .
In the case of California - based IndyMac , a top OTS official authorized the bank to backdate capital <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2008">last year</TIMEX3> , according to the report .
The senior OTS official in the Western United States , Darryl Dochow , resigned after the incident was disclosed .
A second bank in the Southeast was told it could not backdate capital <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2008">last year</TIMEX3> , did not comply and faced no consequences .
OTS discovered that a third bank in the Northeast had backdated capital <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2008">last year</TIMEX3> , but no action was taken .
