Bush Calls Bailout Vital to Economy , Will Meet With McCain and Obama President Bush said <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2008-09-24">yesterday</TIMEX3> that the credit crisis that has seized world markets could devastate the U.S. economy unless Congress acts quickly to approve a $ 700 billion bailout plan for the nation 's financial system , a message aimed at reluctant lawmakers as much as a deeply skeptical public .
` ` Our entire economy is in danger , '' Bush said in an address from the White House , emphasizing that the massive bailout was not targeted at ` ` any individual company or industry .
It is aimed at preserving America 's overall economy . ''
Warning that ` ` America could slip into a financial panic , '' Bush blamed the crisis on ` ` easy credit '' in the housing market and ` ` the faulty assumption that home values would continue to rise . ''
As mortgage loans went bad and borrowers defaulted , he said , investors have succumbed to a ` ` widespread loss of confidence '' that threatens to shut down consumer lending , decimate the stock market , cause businesses and banks to fail -- and cost millions of Americans their jobs .
` ` Ultimately , our country could experience a long and painful recession , '' Bush said .
` ` Fellow citizens , we must not let this happen . ''
Bush delivered the prime - time speech , his first in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P1Y" mod="MORE_THAN">over a year</TIMEX3> , after a clamor on Capitol Hill for him to acknowledge the most serious financial crisis in decades and to personally make the case for the government intervention his administration has proposed .
<TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P5D">Five days</TIMEX3> after unveiling the bailout plan , which seeks to purchase troubled assets from faltering financial institutions , administration officials were still struggling to line up support among lawmakers appalled by its cost , doubtful of its methods and outraged by the speed with which they were being pushed to act .
While the usually fractious Senate seemed to be coming together behind a version of the proposal , the administration had big trouble in the House , particularly among mistrustful Republicans who said the White House had failed to make a case for the bailout in terms ordinary people could understand .
` ` I ' m seeking answers to two fundamental questions : Why this ?

And why <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> ? ''
Rep. Deborah Pryce -LRB- R - Ohio -RRB- said before Bush delivered his remarks .
` ` You ca n't make a move this large without the approval of the American people .
And we do n't have it , yet . ''
Despite such skepticism , top members of the House Financial Services and Senate Banking committees are slated to sit down <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="TIME" value="2008-09-25TMO">this morning</TIMEX3> in an effort to draft the final details of a bipartisan bill .
Bush also invited congressional leaders as well as presidential candidates John McCain and Barack Obama to meet with him at the White House <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2008-09-25">today</TIMEX3> .
The president 's top economic advisers were lobbying hard <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2008-09-24">yesterday</TIMEX3> for passage of the bill .
In testimony before the House Financial Services Committee , Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. said the White House would drop its resistance to lawmakers ' demands for limits on executive compensation at companies that accept taxpayer money .
Rep. Barney Frank -LRB-
D - Mass .
-RRB- , the committee 's chairman , called that a ` ` big step forward '' and said he would push <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2009">next year</TIMEX3> to apply those limits more broadly .
Frank said Democrats in the House and Senate had reached agreement on a bill that would include an oversight board to monitor the bailout program , requirements that taxpayers share in future profits of companies that seek assistance and new powers for bankruptcy judges to modify home mortgages for distressed borrowers .
Lawmakers also discussed doling out the money in segments , Frank said , adding , ` ` It 's not going to be a straight $ 700 billion . ''
Democrats will present that bill <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="TIME" value="2008-09-25TMO">this morning</TIMEX3> to Republican lawmakers in hopes of reaching a final agreement , Frank said .
He said the biggest sticking points are likely to be the bankruptcy provision and a proposal by Senate Democrats to dedicate to affordable housing some of the proceeds from the eventual sale of the assets .
Hours before Bush 's speech , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi -LRB- D - Calif .
-RRB- and House Minority Leader John A. Boehner -LRB-
R - Ohio -RRB- issued a joint statement saying they were ` ` working in a bipartisan manner '' and had ` ` made progress '' on a bill .
But even as the substance of a deal began to take shape , the politics were in turmoil .
McCain declared that he did ` ` not believe that the plan on the table will pass '' and announced he was leaving the campaign trail to return to Capitol Hill to lead negotiations , a move panned by Democrats as a political stunt .
Meanwhile , with <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="P6W" mod="LESS_THAN">less than six weeks</TIMEX3> until the <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2007-11">November</TIMEX3> election , Democratic leaders said they would approve the plan only if a majority of Republicans in both chambers endorsed it as well .
