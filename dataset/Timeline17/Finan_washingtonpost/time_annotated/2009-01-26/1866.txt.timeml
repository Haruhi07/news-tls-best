At the start of the Obama administration , Geithner tackled one of the most immense challenges ever to face an economic policymaker : pulling the U.S. economy out of the deepest recession in at least a generation and rescuing a financial system that was in utter disarray .
As such , he became a punching bag for criticism of the aggressive Obama strategy to rescue the economy , with some critics even demanding his resignation .
But at <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011" mod="START">the start of 2011</TIMEX3> , the economy disaster was averted and many of Obama 's top economic hands had departed while Geither , ironically , remained .
As Treasury secretary , Geithner allocated the remaining $ 350 billion of the giant financial rescue package known as TARP green - lighted by Congress just days before Obama 's inauguration .
He decided which banks and other financial companies to rescue and which to ignore and what conditions the government would attach to the rescue money .
Geithner also played a significant role in shaping the administration 's $ 787 billion economic stimulus package , enacted in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2009-02">February 2009</TIMEX3> .
And he played a lead role in shaping the Dodd - Frank the <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-07">July 2010</TIMEX3> financial regulation overhaul package .
As president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York from <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2003">2003</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3> , Geithner was one of the lead architects of the government response to the <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> - <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3> crisis .
It was his decision , along with those of Bush Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke , to bail out Bear Stearns in <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2008-03">March 2008</TIMEX3> , to let Lehman Brothers fail in <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2008-09">September of that year</TIMEX3> , and for the government to take over insurance company American International Group .
Before any of that , Geithner was a top Treasury Department official in the Clinton years , dealing with the international financial crises of <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="1995">1995</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="1998">1998</TIMEX3> .
He was a protege of Clinton administration Treasury Secretaries Robert Rubin and , especially , Larry Summers .
Summers was the other leading candidate to be Obama 's Treasury secretary and instead served as a top White House economic adviser .
After a flap about delinquent tax payments , the Senate confirmed Geithner , 60 to 34 , on <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2009-01-26">Jan. 26 , 2009</TIMEX3> .
Amid all the gloom - and - doom , there was one piece of lighthearted news for the fledgling secretary in <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2009-04">April 2009</TIMEX3> when he was named to People 's annual list of the ` ` 100 Most Beautiful People . ''

Alma Mater : Dartmouth College , Bachelor 's Degree , <TIMEX3 tid="t36" type="DATE" value="1983">1983</TIMEX3> ; Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies , Master 's , <TIMEX3 tid="t37" type="DATE" value="1985">1985</TIMEX3> Geithner was born in New York City in <TIMEX3 tid="t38" type="DATE" value="1961">1961</TIMEX3> , but he spent most of his youth abroad , living with his family in a variety of countries including India , Thailand , and what is <TIMEX3 tid="t39" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> Zimbabwe .
His nomadic childhood inspired an interest in language and culture .
An amateur photographer , his travels allowed him to capture unique subjects .
While living in Thailand , he took photographs of refugees and ` ` turned our bathroom in Bangkok into a darkroom , '' his mother has said .
Geithner went from Dartmouth to the Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies , where he received a master 's in international economics and East Asian studies in <TIMEX3 tid="t44" type="DATE" value="1985">1985</TIMEX3> .
Geithner was then hired at Kissinger Associates , the prominent international and business consulting firm founded by former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t45" type="DATE" value="1988">1988</TIMEX3> , Geithner joined the Treasury Department as a career civil servant , working on issues involving Japan as a special assistant to an undersecretary .
He worked there through the George H.W. Bush administration and into the Clinton years , when then - Under Secretary Summers was deeply impressed by the young staffer who had the same intellectual intensity as Summers .

But Geithner had a more affable manner than the often brusque Harvard economist .
` ` In Geithner , Summers recognized the perfect complement , '' The New Republic reported .
Indeed , Geithner was one of the few officials who had the brains and self - confidence to stand up to Summers in internal debates .
` ` He 's the only guy that would walk in and say , ` on this one , Larry , you 're full of it , ' ''
Summers said .
Summers promoted Geithner to be a deputy assistant secretary in <TIMEX3 tid="t46" type="DATE" value="1994">1994</TIMEX3> , and later to assistant secretary and then under secretary for international affairs .
In those jobs , Geithner helped manage the Treasury 's response to the Meixcan peso crisis in <TIMEX3 tid="t47" type="DATE" value="1995">1995</TIMEX3> , the East Asian crises of <TIMEX3 tid="t48" type="DATE" value="1997">1997</TIMEX3> - <TIMEX3 tid="t49" type="DATE" value="1998">1998</TIMEX3> , and the Russian debt default in <TIMEX3 tid="t50" type="DATE" value="1998">1998</TIMEX3> and near - collapse of the hedge fund Long Term Capital Management .
Geithner was the first career civil servant to serve as a Treasury under secretary .
At the end of the Clinton administration , Geithner moved to the International Monetary Fund , where he was director of policy development .
That period led to a blot on his personal record .
The IMF does n't pay the employer match on Social Security and Medicare taxes , meaning Geithner was responsible for paying those taxes himself .
He did n't do so , however , until he was audited in <TIMEX3 tid="t51" type="DATE" value="2005">2005</TIMEX3> , and even then only paid the back taxes for <TIMEX3 tid="t52" type="DATE" value="2003">2003</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t53" type="DATE" value="2004">2004</TIMEX3> .
Geithner did n't pay the back taxes for <TIMEX3 tid="t54" type="DATE" value="2001">2001</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t55" type="DATE" value="2002">2002</TIMEX3> until after Obama tapped him to be Treasury secretary at <TIMEX3 tid="t57" type="DATE" value="2008" mod="END">the end of 2008</TIMEX3> .
Federal Reserve Bank of New York
In <TIMEX3 tid="t58" type="DATE" value="2003">2003</TIMEX3> , after a long search , Geithner was named president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York .
In that job , he was the Fed 's eyes and ears on Wall Street , the primary regulator of some of the largest U.S. banks , and one of its lead crisis managers .
In the years before the financial crisis began in <TIMEX3 tid="t59" type="DATE" value="2007">2007</TIMEX3> , Geithner delivered many speeches discussing weaknesses in the financial regulatory system , especially frailties in the market for credit default swaps and other over - the - counter derivatives .
Those warnings turned out to be prescient , as those markets contributed to the deep crisis underway .
However , Geithner 's speeches often argued that as a whole the financial system was becoming more stable , and he did not take aggressive action to rein in the risk - taking of Wall Street firms .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t62" type="DATE" value="2008-08">August 2008</TIMEX3> , financial markets began a wrenching crisis as losses mounted on securities tied to subprime mortgage loans .
The crisis had spread to all types of credit products , with transactions freezing up , financial instiutions incurring huge losses and lending drying up throughout the economy .
As chairman of the New York Fed , Geithner was a lead architect of the government 's response , including a campaign of interest rate cuts starting in <TIMEX3 tid="t67" type="DATE" value="2007-09">September 2007</TIMEX3> that pushed the federal funds rate to near zero by <TIMEX3 tid="t68" type="DATE" value="2008-12">December 2008</TIMEX3> .
In internal Fed debates , Geithner reliably pushed for more active intervention to guard the economy than did some of his colleagues further from Wall Street .
He negotiated the deal to sell failed investment bank Bear Stearns to J.P. Morgan Chase in <TIMEX3 tid="t71" type="DATE" value="2008-03">March 2008</TIMEX3> , ultimately putting $ 29 billion of Fed assets at risk to get the deal done .
<TIMEX3 tid="t73" type="DATE" value="2008-09">Six months later</TIMEX3> , when Lehman Brothers was on the verge of failure , Geithner was more open to saving it than Bush Treasury Secretary Paulson , but Paulson 's hardline position prevailed and it went under .
Just days later , Geithner engineered the takeover of AIG , the single largest of the government bailouts so far .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t77" type="DATE" value="2009-02">February 2009</TIMEX3> , Geithner announced his first initiative in stabilizing the financial system .
Called the Financial Stability Plan , Geithner outlined what he would do with the $ 350 billion remaining from the TARP fund , including direct capital injections to banks .
But Geithner went much further than his predecessor .
He announced an initial $ 250 billion to $ 500 billion ` ` bad bank '' program that would be a joint effort between the Federal Reserve and the Treasury to buy toxic assets that banks were n't able to sell .
Also included was up to $ 1 trillion in financing for consumers and student loans , including for small businesses , car payments and tuition .
Geithner fought hard for these initiatives , as the New York Times reported that many in the administration , including Obama senior adviser David Axelrod , wanted tougher restrictions on executive pay and how banks spend taxpayer money .

But the final copy of the plan had Geithner 's fingerprints all over it .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t84" type="DATE" value="2009-05">May 2009</TIMEX3> , the administration released the results of stress tests that financial regulators , including the Fed , FDIC and Treasury 's Office of the Comptroller of the Currency , performed on struggling banks that were deemed ` ` too big to fail . ''
The tests were designed to measure what the banks needed , in terms of capital , to withstand a prolonged recession .
For <TIMEX3 tid="t87" type="DURATION" value="P3M">three months</TIMEX3> , regulators examined the bank 's financials , deciding how each company would react if the economy worsened , jobless rates rose and home prices continued to fall .
Many analysts predicted the banks would need to raise more than $ 100 billion in capital , to pass these tests .

But when the Treasury announced the final figures , many of the banks fared much better than expected .
Ten of the 19 banks would need to increase their capital holdings by $ 75 billion dollars , collectively .
Bank of America needed to raise the most capital at nearly $ 34 billion .
With the stress tests showing an overall positive outlook for the financial system , banks with sufficient capital could start paying back TARP funds .
` ` With this support , and with the clarity provided by <TIMEX3 tid="t91" type="DATE" value="2009-01-26">today</TIMEX3> 's announcement , banks should be able to get back to the business of banking , '' said Geithner when releasing the results of the stress tests .
<TIMEX3 tid="t92" type="DURATION" value="P2W">Two weeks</TIMEX3> after the results of the stress tests were announced , Geithner testified in front of the Senate Banking Committee .
He announced that the 10 banks that needed to increase capital had raised or announced plans to raise over $ 48 billion .
Geithner said in his written statement to the committee that ` ` there are important indications that our financial system is starting to heal . ''
Geithner took a lead role in revamping financial regulation , which was shepherded through Congress by Sen. Christopher J. Dodd -LRB- D - Conn .
-RRB- and Barney Frank -LRB-
D - Mass .
-RRB- .
It was enacted in <TIMEX3 tid="t96" type="DATE" value="2010-07">July 2010</TIMEX3> .
The bill would allow for the orderly dissolution of big financial institutions whose destruction would threaten the entire U.S. economy at no cost to taxpayers ; for the first time , regulate the derivatives market that was blamed for helping to cause the <TIMEX3 tid="t97" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> - <TIMEX3 tid="t98" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> meltdown ; create a financial council overseen by the Treasury Department to coordinate and monitor risk in the financial markets ; create an independent consumer watchdog inside the Federal Reserve to give U.S. consumers clear information regarding financial products like credit cards and mortgages ; and imposes regulations on derivatives trading , requiring most of it to take place in open marketplaces .
In written 2009 remarks to the Senate Finance Committee , Geithner signaled a more aggressive approach to negotiating trade policies with China .
The Chinese government artificially deflates its currency , the renmibi or yuan , which leads to cheap exports .
Ahead of Chinese President Hu Jintao 's <TIMEX3 tid="t103" type="DATE" value="2011-01">January 2011</TIMEX3> state visit to the U.S. , Geithner delivered a speech arguing that China must move more aggressively to increase the value of the yuan , as well as address intellectual - property theft .
` ` We believe it is in China 's interest to allow the currency to appreciate more rapidly in response to market forces .
And we believe China will do so because the alternative will be too costly - both for China and for China 's relations with the rest of the world , '' Geithner said .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t104" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3> , the House approved a special tax to offset what lawmakers believed was China 's ` ` currency manipulation , '' although the Senate did n't vote on the issue .
Geithner has spent more years in public service than many of the former Street veterans he works with , but his connections tie him to the slew of Goldman Sachs alumni that have <TIMEX3 tid="t105" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> populated the Treasury Department , including Rubin and former Bush Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , both former Goldman chairmen .
It was Rubin who gave a young Geithner his shot at bigger things at the Treasury , and the New York Times says Geithner ` slack of work experience in the financial sector , ` ` has left him reliant on Wall Street chiefs to guide his thinking and that Goldman alumni have figured prominently in his ascent . ''
Geithner is also a member of the Group of 30 , a nonprofit that brings together thirty of the most influential people from the public and private sectors .
Members include Nobel - prize winning economist Paul Krugman , and Larry Summers , a former high - profile Obama economic adviser .
Geithner spent <TIMEX3 tid="t107" type="DURATION" value="P6M">six months</TIMEX3> of <TIMEX3 tid="t106" type="DATE" value="2001">2001</TIMEX3> as a senior fellow on the Council on Foreign Relations and is still a member of its advisory board , along with Stephen Friedman and former secretary of state Madeleine Albright .
