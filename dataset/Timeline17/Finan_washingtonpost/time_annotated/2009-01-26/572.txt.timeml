We all want President Obama to succeed in reviving the economy , but that should n't obscure the long odds he faces .
We need to recognize that we 're grappling with three crises that , though interwoven , are also quite distinct .
The solution to any one of them wo n't automatically resuscitate the larger economy if the others remain untreated and unchanged .
First : the collapse of consumer spending .
American consumers represent 70 percent of the economy .
Traumatized by plunging home values and stock prices -- which have shaved at least $ 7 trillion from personal wealth -- they ' ve curbed spending and increased saving .
That 's led directly to layoffs .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2008-12">December</TIMEX3> , vehicle sales were down 36 percent from levels <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2007-12">a year earlier</TIMEX3> .
Second : the financial crisis .
Lower lending deprives the economy of the credit to finance businesses , homes and costly consumer purchases -LRB- cars , appliances -RRB- .
The deepest cuts involve ` ` securitization '' -- the sale of bonds .
Investors have gone on strike .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> , the issuance of bonds backing credit card loans fell 41 percent and those backing car loans 51 percent .
Third : a trade crisis .
Global spending and saving patterns are badly askew .
High - saving Asian countries have relied on export - led growth that , in turn , has required American consumers to spend ever - larger shares of their incomes .
Huge trade imbalances have resulted : U.S. deficits , Asian surpluses .
As Americans cut spending , this pattern is no longer sustainable .
Asia is tumbling into recession .
Overcoming any of these crises alone would be daunting .
Together , they 're the economic equivalent of a combined Ironman triathlon and Tour de France .
The proposed remedy is the ` ` economic stimulus '' plan .
If government does n't offset declines in consumer and other private spending , the economy might spiral down for <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="PXY">several years</TIMEX3> .
<TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2009-W04">Last week</TIMEX3> , House committees considered an $ 825 billion package , split between $ 550 billion in additional spending and $ 275 billion in tax cuts .
But in practice , the stimulus could disappoint .
Parts of the House package look like a giant political slush fund , with money sprinkled to dozens of programs .
There 's $ 50 million for the National Endowment for the Arts , $ 200 million for the Teacher Incentive Fund and $ 15.6 billion for increased Pell Grants to college students .
Some of these proposals , whatever their other merits , wo n't produce many new jobs .
Another problem : Construction spending -- for schools , clinics , roads -- may start so slowly that there will be little immediate economic boost .
The Congressional Budget Office examined $ 356 billion in spending proposals and concluded that only 7 percent would be spent in <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2031">31</TIMEX3> percent in <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3> .
Assume , however , that the stimulus is a smashing success .
It cushions the recession .
Unemployment -LRB- <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> : 7.2 percent -RRB- stops rising at , say , 8 percent instead of 10 percent .
Still , a temporary stimulus ca n't fuel a permanent recovery .
That requires a strong financial system to supply an expanding economy 's credit needs .
How we get that is n't clear .
The pillars of a successful financial system -- the ability to assess risk ; adequate capital to absorb losses ; and trust among banks , investors and traders -- have crumbled .
Underlying these ills has been the consistent underestimation of losses .
Economists at Goldman Sachs <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> believe that worldwide losses on mortgages , bonds , and loans to consumers and businesses total $ 2.1 trillion .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2008-03">March</TIMEX3> , the Goldman estimate was about half that .
All the new credit programs -- the Treasury 's Troubled Asset Relief Program -LRB- TARP -RRB- and various Federal Reserve lending facilities -- aim to counteract these problems by providing government money and government guarantees .
Obama probably will expand these efforts , despite some obvious problems : If government oversight becomes too intrusive or punitive , it might deter much - needed infusions of private capital into banks .
Again , let 's assume Obama 's policies succeed .
Even then , we have no assurance of a vigorous recovery because the economic crisis is ultimately global in scope .
The old trading patterns simply wo n't work anymore .
If China and other Asian nations try to export their way out of trouble , they 're likely to be disappointed .
Any import surge into the United States would weaken an incipient American recovery and probably trigger a protectionist reaction .
Down that path lies tit - for - tat economic nationalism that might harm everyone .
Indeed , if the rest of the world does n't buy more from America , any U.S. recovery may be feeble .
What 's needed are policies that correct the imbalances in spending and saving .
As Americans save more of their incomes , Asians should save less and spend more , so that they rely more on producing for themselves rather than exporting to us .
The great trade discrepancies would shrink .
But this sort of transformation would require basic political changes in Asia .
Whether China and other Asian societies can make those changes is unclear .
The implications are sobering .
The success of Obama 's policies lies , to a large extent , outside his hands .
