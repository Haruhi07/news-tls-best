The financial crisis is by no means over , but the urge to extract lessons from it already is irresistible .
The Europeans have pressed successfully for a new Bretton Woods summit , modeled after the <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="1944">1944</TIMEX3> gathering that inoculated the world against a repeat of the Great Depression .
Although the original Bretton Woods took place years after the Depression , Britain and France are bent on staging the new version within weeks .
` ` Europe wants it .
Europe will get it , '' French President Nicolas Sarkozy said before jetting off to Camp David , where President Bush meekly gave in to him .
The Bretton Woods analogy is contrived , to put it mildly .
That summit created the World Bank to reconstruct Europe after the ravages of World War II .
<TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2008-10-20">Today</TIMEX3> , bombed - out infrastructure is hardly the issue .
Bretton Woods also created the International Monetary Fund , to support a system of fixed exchange rates .
But the world has largely abandoned that system , and <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2008-10-20">today</TIMEX3> 's chief exchange - rate challenge is to move even further from Bretton Woods by persuading China to float its currency .
Bretton Woods boosters assert that a global financial system needs global regulatory fixes .
This claim deserves scrutiny .
The fix that rightly commands widest support is moving the swap contracts between financial institutions onto centralized exchanges , so the collapse of one large player does not threaten others that entered into swaps with it .
But this reform can be achieved with a minimum of international coordination .
Countries can unilaterally establish swaps exchanges , and financial institutions all over the world can use them .
The second fix on most reformers ' lists is to shrink the pyramids of debt in the financial system .
When a bank or a hedge fund buys $ 100 million of assets with $ 5 million in capital and $ 95 million in debt , a 5 percent loss is enough to wipe it out , forcing liquidation of the remaining $ 95 million worth of stocks or bonds in its portfolio .
Such fire - sale liquidation has driven part of the <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> market turmoil ; it forces prices down and damages other debt - laden players , which then join in the selling .
Although such debt , or ` ` leverage , '' is certainly dangerous , a new Bretton Woods summit is not going to tame it .
We know this because we ' ve tried already .
It took <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P5Y">five years</TIMEX3> , not a handful of photo - op summits , to negotiate the so - called Basel II standards that govern leverage at banks , and the resulting deal proved ineffectual anyway .
Daniel Tarullo , who has just published a Peterson Institute book on Basel , points out that the next attempt to control leverage may need to be broader .
After the events of <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent months</TIMEX3> , that is surely right .
Given AIG 's failure , the next round should probably encompass insurers .
Given the vast growth of hedge funds , it should also cover some of them .
Creating sensible leverage rules for such disparate institutions will be fiendishly complex , perhaps even impossible .
So what might a new Bretton Woods conference usefully do ?
Well , it could reform the IMF , which has evolved from its original role into a rescue fund for collapsing currencies .
During the emerging market crises of <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="199X">a decade ago</TIMEX3> , the IMF was central to all the bailouts .
Its status has since dwindled .
As my Council on Foreign Relations colleague Brad Setser notes , the Chinese have tried to muscle in on the IMF 's turf by helping Pakistan .
The Russians have tried to help Iceland .
The European Union has helped Hungary .
Reestablishing the IMF as the agreed provider of bailouts would be a worthwhile project .
The IMF puts economic conditions on its loans while governments place political ones ; we do n't want to revive the cronyism of the Cold War , when countries from Cuba to Zaire could pursue absurd policies and know they would be bailed out because they were strategically useful .
The irony is that Britain and France will be the first to resist a serious effort to revive the IMF .
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown talks vacuously about giving the organization the role of creating an early - warning system for crises , even though this is what thousands of economic forecasters already try to provide .
What Brown does not stress is that serious IMF reform needs to begin with the modernization of its board .
Rising powers such as China and India deserve more say .
Declining powers need to give up some influence -- and that includes France and Britain .
Of course there is a role for global cooperation .

The coordinated interest rate cuts and bank rescues of <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent days</TIMEX3> have been constructive .

But it 's worth remembering that after the last global crisis , in <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="1997">1997</TIMEX3> - <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="1998">98</TIMEX3> , there was lots of grand talk about a new international financial architecture .
In the end , the only important reforms were national ones .
Governments ran budget surpluses and built up foreign reserves to protect themselves from the next shock .
That shock has arrived , and we are about to find out if those changes were enough .
One thing is certain : They were not the result of any international conference .
