<TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2008-09-30">Tuesday</TIMEX3> , <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2008-09-30">September 30 , 2008</TIMEX3> ; <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="TIME" value="2008-09-30T10:10">10:10 AM</TIMEX3> Most Americans see the <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> financial situation as a ` ` crisis , '' and there is overwhelming concern that the failure of the House of Representatives to pass the economic recovery package will deepen the problem , according to a new Washington Post - ABC News poll .

But the poll also revealed significant public concern with the bill Congress rejected <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2008-09-29">yesterday</TIMEX3> , as few voters said the package did enough to protect ` ` ordinary Americans , '' and nearly half said it did not go far enough to shore up the nation 's economy .
Nevertheless , nearly nine in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="1910">10</TIMEX3> expressed concern that the failure of the bill could lead to a more severe economic decline , including a slim majority calling themselves ` ` very worried . ''
High levels of concern cross party lines , but Democrats and Republicans have contrasting views of the urgency of the situation .
In the poll , 60 percent of Democrats call the economic woes a crisis , compared with 44 percent of Republicans .
Overall , voters split about evenly on the failed bill -- 45 percent supported it , 47 percent opposed it .
Among the reasons for the tepid public reception is that there is a roughly even divide about whether government efforts will prevent the financial situation from deteriorating further still .
And on the particulars , about as many voters said the plan rejected by Congress did ` ` too much '' to help major financial institutions that got into trouble as said that the bill did ` ` too little . ''
Nearly half said the failed plan did not do enough to help the broader economy , and more , 61 percent said there was insufficient assistance for the general public .
That the bill did not go far enough to aid the public is a view shared by Democrats -LRB- 69 percent -RRB- , independents -LRB- 59 percent -RRB- and Republicans -LRB- 50 percent -RRB- alike .
Asked to assess responsibility for the legislation 's failure , 44 percent said Republicans were the reason , 21 percent said the Democrats and 17 percent said both sides were responsible .
On the broader economic problems facing the country , voters spread the blame .
In an open - ended question , a quarter of all voters said George W. Bush is responsible for the economy 's relatively poor performance , more than any other single cause .
About a quarter name Congress -LRB- 8 percent -RRB- , the federal government -LRB- 8 percent -RRB- and Democrats and Republicans -LRB- 5 percent each -RRB- together .
Eighteen percent said Wall Street financial institutions and banks shoulder responsibility , 7 percent blame ` ` everyone '' and 5 percent highlighted the role of individuals who borrowed too much .
Partisan filters dominate on this question : Nearly half of all Democrats blame Bush ; that is just 4 percent among Republicans .
Moreover , no Democrats blamed ` ` Democrats '' generally ; no Republicans singled out ` ` Republicans . ''
Despite the negative assessment of the <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> financial situation , four in <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2010">10</TIMEX3> remain optimistic about the state of the national economy over <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2009">the next year</TIMEX3> and six in <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2010">10</TIMEX3> are bullish about their family 's financial situation .
But pessimism about personal finances has climbed <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DURATION" value="P2Y" mod="MORE_THAN">over the past two years</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> stands at more than double its level in <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2006-12">December 2006</TIMEX3> .
The poll was conducted by telephone <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2008-09-29">yesterday</TIMEX3> among a random sample of 520 adults and 424 registered voters .
The margin of sampling error among registered voters is plus or minus five percentage points .
