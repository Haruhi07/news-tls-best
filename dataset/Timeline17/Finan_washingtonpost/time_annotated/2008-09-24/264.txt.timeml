<TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2008-09-24">Wednesday</TIMEX3> , <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2008-09-24">September 24 , 2008</TIMEX3> ; <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="TIME" value="2008-09-24T14:00">2:00 PM</TIMEX3> Washington Post staff writers David Nakamura and Anita Kumar were online <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2008-09-24">Wednesday</TIMEX3> , <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2008-09-24">Sept. 24</TIMEX3> at <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="TIME" value="2008-09-24T14:00">2 p.m.</TIMEX3> ET to discuss how the lower home prices , unemployment and the downturn in the economy are causing budget shortfalls for D.C. , Virginia and Maryland .
` ` Virginia officials said <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2008-09-23">yesterday</TIMEX3> that the state budget shortfall may be as wide as $ 3 billion <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="P2Y" mod="MORE_THAN">over two years</TIMEX3> , triple what they estimated <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2008-08">a month ago</TIMEX3> , while District officials said they are facing a gap of $ 131 million after years of surpluses . ''
-- From <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2008-09-24">Wednesday</TIMEX3> 's story Arlington , Va. : I see Gov. Kaine said he will not propose raising taxes .
So , how much can I expect my taxes to go up ?
Alexandria , Va. : Is it fair to assume we wo n't be seeing any progress on the Dulles Extension , a Silver Line , expanding I-66 inside the beltway , etc . , anytime soon ?
Washington , D.C. : How much of this shortfall could DC avoid by rooting out some of the corruption and waste that plague it ?
Washington , D.C. : Are we likely to see the District and Virginia , either at the state or county level , mandate unpaid leave or furloughs ?
Anonymous : I ' m a home owner and do n't get it .
Home prices are up and so are assessments .
I know prices have dropped but the most <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> assessment have not gone down .
Where 's the revenue shortfall , foreclosures ?
Other than the District , Maryland and Virginia added many new houses to their infrastructure .
It seems there should be a solid base or equilibrium base to project revenues .
David Nakamura : Good question .
Here 's the answer , at least in D.C. West Falls Church , Va. : Did any of the governments budget conservatively ?

The housing market , at the very least , has been bad for years <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> .
I never understand why governments do n't plan for the worst , then , if they end up with a surplus , it 's a pleasant surprise .
Columbia , Md.
: My husband is a firefighter in PG County , which is furloughing all of its public safety employees for <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DURATION" value="PT56H">56 hours</TIMEX3> -- <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DURATION" value="PT8H">8 hours</TIMEX3> per pay period until <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2009-SP">next spring</TIMEX3> .
I ' ve also heard that the county is closing some fire stations for <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DURATION" value="PXD">several days</TIMEX3> or weeks as a money - saving tactic as well .
I sure feel for anyone whose house catches fire when the station nearest them is closed .
I also feel for those employees who lives paycheck to paycheck or whose spouses -LRB- like me -RRB- ca n't pick up the financial slack caused by an 8 - hour pay loss <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="SET" value="P2W" quant="EVERY">every 2 weeks</TIMEX3> .
There has to be a better way .
Takoma Park , Md. : Is the market instability and clamp down on lending going to affect local businesses ?
Anonymous : If the government is willing to subsidize Wall Street to the tune of $ 700 billion , could n't they send a few billion to the states ?
David Nakamura : Considering Virginia alone is $ 3 billion in the hole , a few billion to the states might not go far .
Of course , the federal government is already subsidizing local budgets .
In D.C. , the city uses $ 5.5 billion in local funds , but it 's overall budget , including federal money and grants , is more than $ 9 billion .
DC tax revenue shortfalls : A reader asked : ` ` Where 's the revenue shortfall , foreclosures ? ''
At least $ 40 million was stolen - that must hurt .
