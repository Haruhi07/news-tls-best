The Bush administration sent some of its most powerful figures to Capitol Hill <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2008-09-23">yesterday</TIMEX3> to rally support for a $ 700 billion plan to revive the U.S. financial system , but they encountered stiff resistance from lawmakers who are deeply skeptical of the proposal and angered by the administration 's push for its speedy approval .
The issue transcended party lines .
Democrats voiced doubts , and many Republicans , particularly in the House , balked at the entreaties from Cheney , Bolten and other officials .
` ` Just because God created the world in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P7D">seven days</TIMEX3> does n't mean we have to pass this bill in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P7D">seven days</TIMEX3> , '' Rep. Joe Barton -LRB-
R - Tex .
-RRB- said after exiting a two - hour meeting with Cheney .
Democratic leaders warned that they would not approve the biggest government intervention in the private markets since the Great Depression without significant Republican support .
` ` It 's their problem .
It 's their bill .
And they 're going to have to figure out if they can support it , '' said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi -LRB-
D - Calif .
-RRB- .
Paulson and Bernanke , meanwhile , defended themselves before the Senate Banking , Housing and Urban Affairs Committee , where senators fumed that the administration had abetted the meltdown in the markets by failing to halt the spread of exotic home loans that are <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> falling into foreclosure at a record pace .
A wide array of firms bought complicated financial instruments backed by those mortgages ; the administration is proposing to purchase those troubled assets to help those firms stay afloat .
At times <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2008-09-23">yesterday</TIMEX3> , Paulson and Bernanke almost seemed to echo the outrage from their questioners .
` ` I ' m not only concerned , I ' m angry about the things that got us here , '' Paulson said .
` ` It makes me angry , and it makes you angry .
You talk about taxpayers being on the hook ?
They 're already on the hook .
If the system is n't stabilized , they 're going to bear the cost . ''
The vice president got a warmer reception during a luncheon with Senate Republicans .
But afterward , key GOP senators announced that they <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> agree with Democratic demands that the bailout package set limits on executive salaries at financial institutions that participate in the program .
Democrats have argued that chief executives whose companies accept taxpayer money should not be permitted to pocket millions of dollars in bonuses or big severance packages known as ` ` golden parachutes . ''
Paulson and the White House have objected to limits on executive compensation , saying limits would discourage successful firms from participating in the bailout .
` ` These are not all weak or troubled firms that own mortgage - backed securities , '' said White House spokesman Tony Fratto .
` ` They were not necessarily irresponsible players , and so you have to be careful about how you deal with them . ''
But Republican senators , many of whom face voters in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P6W">six weeks</TIMEX3> , have concluded otherwise .
` ` I think executive compensation ought to be part of this , '' Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell -LRB- R - Ky .
-RRB- ` ` I think the taxpayers should expect no less than strict limits on what kind of executive compensation might be possible for those involved in these partially government - controlled enterprises . ''
