'' This Story : Read + | Watch + | At Indian Call Centers , Another View of U.S. .
The Aegis call center in India hums with activity .
As the U.S. economy drops , outsourced debt collection booms .
-LRB-
By Emily Wax -- The Washington Post -RRB- GURGAON , India -- With her flowing , hot - pink Indian suit , jangly silver bangles and perky voice , Bhumika Chaturvedi , 24 , does n't fit the stereotype of a thuggish , heard - it - all - before debt collector .
But lately , she has had no problem making American debtors cry .
For <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P3Y">the past three years</TIMEX3> , Chaturvedi has been a top collection agent at her call center , phoning hundreds of Americans <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> and politely asking them to pay up .
As the U.S. financial crisis plunges Americans into debt , her business is one of the fastest - growing sectors in Indian outsourcing .
It is also one of the few sectors of outsourcing in India that is still hiring aggressively .
Sitting in a narrow cubicle , her head - set switched on , Chaturvedi listens every night to increasingly disturbing tales of woe from the other side of the globe .
` ` My mortgage payments are just too high , honey .
I just ca n't make the payment <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2008-10">this month</TIMEX3> , '' a weeping woman with a Southern accent <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> told her in response to a call for a $ 200 credit card payment .
` ` I ' m sure y ' all heard about the credit crunch and gas prices .
I ' m flat broke . ''
` ` Ma'am , I am here to help you , '' Chaturvedi calmly said .
` ` Ma'am , maybe you could make a small payment , $ 100 or $ 50 , anything that you can . ''
Few places in India absorb and imitate American culture as much as call centers , where ambitious young Indians with fake American accents and American noms de phone spend hours calling people in Indiana or Maine to help navigate software glitches , plan vacations or sell products .
The subculture of call centers tends to foster a cult of America , an over - the - top fantasy where hopes and dreams are easily accomplished by people who live in a brand - name wonderland of high - paying jobs , big houses and luxury getaways .
But collection agents at this call center outside New Delhi are starting to see the flip side of that vision : a country hobbled by debt and filled with people scared of losing their jobs , their houses and their cars .
` ` Lately , 25 - year - old Americans are telling me that they are declaring themselves bankrupt , '' said Chaturvedi , raising her eyebrows in shock .
` ` These days the situation is so emotional , so fragile .
We have to have so much empathy and patience . ''
` ` It 's like people are totally drowning , '' said Omkar Gadgil , 24 , who goes by the alias Richard Rudy and was a math major in college .
He is brainy and considered the office expert on the intricacies of debt collection .
` ` There has just been years of overspending and <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> : the crash . ''
In the past , debt - saddled customers were often annoyed by Chaturvedi 's calls from the open - air office at Aegis BPO Services .
But <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> they seem depressed , defeated .
Even the men sob into the phone , several agents said .
Under the pseudonym Carol Miller , Chaturvedi 's ability to deftly work around the standard line , ` ` The check is in the mail , '' is <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> being challenged by clients throwing out new responses : ` ` How do you expect me to pay ?
This is the worst crisis since the Great Depression . ''
Chaturvedi said she has never seen it so bad .
Many of the young employees say they are flabbergasted at just how widespread the financial ruin appears to be .
