<TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> , what was that about Hank Paulson having blown it ?
How he foolishly let Lehman Brothers go under and started a chain reaction that quickly turned into a financial meltdown ?
How he was so focused on his cockamamie plan to buy up distressed mortgages and mortgage - backed securities , instead of injecting capital into banks in exchange for shares ?
How he and the other finance ministers were so way behind the curve this <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2008-W41-WE">past weekend</TIMEX3> in failing to come up with a detailed and coordinated plan to restore confidence in financial markets ?
The truth is we were going to have a serious financial crisis no matter what Paulson did or did n't do , thanks to the incredible ineptitude of Wall Street and the nation 's financial regulators <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="PXY" mod="MORE_THAN">over the past few years</TIMEX3> , whether an insolvent and mismanaged investment bank was rescued or not .
Lehman was the veritable straw that finally broke the back of the financial camel overloaded with debt .
If it had n't been Lehman , it would have been something else .
Since Lehman 's failure , Paulson has moved faster , more aggressively and more deftly than any of his international counterparts in doing whatever was necessary to stabilize the financial system .
<TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2008-10-13">Yesterday</TIMEX3> , he and his collaborators at the Fed and FDIC threw everything they had at it -- flooding the banking system with an unlimited supply of dollars , expanding deposit insurance , putting a guarantee on new bank debt , injecting capital into healthy banks , giving the Japanese the assurances they needed to rescue Morgan Stanley , and doing nothing to discourage free - spending Democrats from their plans to offer another big economic stimulus plan .
The result : the biggest one - day rally on stock markets in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P70Y">70 years</TIMEX3> .
I hope you wo n't think it petty to point out that some of the people who this <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2008-W41-WE">past weekend</TIMEX3> were complaining that the Treasury secretary was being too timid in his response to the financial crisis were some of the same people who , <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2008-W39">three weeks ago</TIMEX3> , were complaining about his audacity in demanding a ` ` $ 700 billion blank check . ''
I know I speak for Gov. Sarah Palin and Joe Six - Packs everywhere in pleading that , for Pete 's sake , let 's cut the guy a little slack .
In putting several trillion dollars in government funds on the line , the country has <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> done just about everything that Wall Street could have asked to address the financial crisis .
The question <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> , as John Kennedy might have put it , is what Wall Street is ready to do for its country .
So far , the answer is not much .
After getting their closed - door briefing <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2008-10-13">yesterday</TIMEX3> from Paulson on the government 's latest initiatives , Wall Street 's finest literally ran from the Treasury to their waiting limousines , bypassing a media scrum eager to convey any scrap of wisdom or insight .
Court reporters will tell you they can always tell the innocent from the guilty on these kinds of perp walks , and the Wall Street crowd <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2008-10-13">yesterday</TIMEX3> looked particularly guilty , unable even to conjure up a soothing word to a nation fretting over its shrunken 401
-LRB- k -RRB- s , or a simple thank you to taxpayers for having saved their bacon .
Their silence and invisibility throughout this crisis attests to the moral and political bankruptcy of a financial elite that is the perfect match for the financial bankruptcy they have <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> visited upon their investors , their creditors and their customers .
After <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2008-10-13">yesterday</TIMEX3> 's ` ` historic '' meeting , we are told by industry apologists that we are supposed to be grateful to nine leading banks for having ` ` volunteered '' to accept additional capital from the Treasury , along with a government guarantee for newly issued bank debt , even if it means having to accept a dilution of existing shares and a few harmless restrictions on their operations .
