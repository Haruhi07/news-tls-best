The U.S. government is dramatically escalating its response to the financial crisis by planning to invest $ 250 billion in the country 's banks , forcing nine of the largest to accept a Treasury stake in what amounts to a partial nationalization .
News that European governments also planned to take stakes in their banks and anticipation of new U.S. measures unleashed a tremendous surge in U.S. stock prices <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2008-10-13">yesterday</TIMEX3> , with the Dow Jones industrial average soaring to the biggest percentage gain since <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="193">the 1930s</TIMEX3> , up 11.1 percent .
It ended 936.42 points higher , the largest point gain ever , just days after the Dow had its steepest weekly decline in history .
The Treasury Department 's decision to take equity stakes in banks represents a significant reversal , coming just weeks after Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. had opposed the idea .
In a momentous meeting <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2008-10-13TAF">yesterday afternoon</TIMEX3> in Washington , Paulson , flanked by top financial regulators , told the executives of nine leading banks that they needed to participate in the program for the good of the national economy , two industry sources said on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly .
The government 's initiative , which was to be announced <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="TIME" value="2008-10-14TMO">this morning</TIMEX3> before the markets open for New York trading , is part of a wider plan that goes beyond the $ 700 billion rescue package approved by Congress <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2008-10" mod="START">earlier this month</TIMEX3> .

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is also set to announce <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2008-10-14">today</TIMEX3> the launch of an insurance fund to guarantee new issues of bank debt .
It will provide unlimited deposit insurance for non - interest - bearing accounts , which are widely used by small businesses for payroll and other purposes .
In pressing the bank executives to accept partial government ownership , Paulson 's message was clear : Though officially the program was voluntary , the banks had little choice in the matter .
In exchange for giving the Treasury minority stakes , the nine firms would jointly receive an investment worth $ 125 billion .
The government would make another $ 125 billion available for <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="P30D">the next 30 days</TIMEX3> to thousands of other banks and thrifts across the country .
Federal officials set conditions , telling the banks they could not raise their dividends without government permission and could not offer their executives new retirement packages , though the old packages would remain intact .
Paulson told them the moves would shore up confidence in their own institutions , spark lending throughout the system and send a message to smaller institutions that there is no stigma in accepting federal funding .
Though some were reluctant , all of the executives complied .
There is a risk that banks will take the new government capital and use it to bolster their balance sheets but still not resume lending , and the Treasury is not getting any specific contractual guarantee to prevent that from happening .
But bank regulators , particularly the Federal Reserve , will lean heavily on the firms receiving infusions to use the capital to increase their lending to businesses and consumers .
Taken together , the steps planned by the Treasury , the FDIC and the Federal Reserve amount to a monumental effort to jump - start the business of lending , which all but dried up in <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent weeks</TIMEX3> as banks have lost faith in one another and their customers .
Global markets began to melt down .
Some emerging nations teetered on the brink of financial collapse .
Over <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2008-W41-WE">the weekend</TIMEX3> , global leaders agreed in meetings in Washington to launch a coordinated program of injecting cash into the world 's banks and guaranteeing their debt .
The action by U.S. officials <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2008-10-13">yesterday</TIMEX3> represented the U.S. version of those broad principles , and it was matched by similar efforts in Europe <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2008-10-13">yesterday</TIMEX3> .
As part of the effort to flood the financial system with cash , the Federal Reserve made unlimited funds available <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2008-10-13" mod="START">early yesterday</TIMEX3> to other major central banks so they could inject money into banks in their countries and ease the shortage of dollars they face .
Previously , the Fed 's program of lending dollars to the European Central Bank , Bank of England , Bank of Japan and others had been capped at a total of $ 380 billion .
Under the rescue legislation signed into law <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2008-10" mod="START">earlier this month</TIMEX3> , the Treasury is allowed to take equity stakes in banks .
