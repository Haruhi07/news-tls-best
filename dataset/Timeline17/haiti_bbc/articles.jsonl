'' \nHe can not understand why food arrives on US Navy helicopters from the international donor operation , but little of it appears to have been given to people in the town . \nLeogane has a population of 200,000 ; few if any are sleeping under solid roofs . \nThousands of people grabbed what possessions they could and moved to the largest open space in the town , the school football field . \nHere they have erected shelters . \nTed Valcout had grabbed some house bricks and a dozen pieces of timber and was trying to reinforce the structure that he has built for the nine members of his family . \n`` We have some food , but we have to share it with these people , '' he said , gesturing to his neighbors in the makeshift camp . \nThere had been one food distribution at the football ground since it became a camp for the displaced , he said . \nHe is not sure where the food came from , and not everyone was able to get their hands on some , he said . \n`` People near the gate were OK , but those right at the back of the pitch did not get lined up in time and they missed out , '' he said . \nThere is no apparent organization in the camp ; at one point a few days ago , registration forms were circulated and signed , but there has been no follow-up . \nEvery open area in the town now has homeless people living on it , and families have put up shelters in the middle of many streets . \nMr Santos says , even though it is very congested , people are better off in the stadium because they are more likely to get food and water . \nIt is the only way we can exist , we have to borrow and rely on other people . \nWe have nothing at all - nothing This is borne out by the experience of Francoise Casseus . \nShe and her extended family have decided to shelter under a tree and a few sheets of cloth and plastic right next to their destroyed home . \nShe does not want to move because the body of one of her daughters is still inside the building , and she fears that if they abandon the house , looters will come and take what they can from the rubble . \nFrancoise and her relatives have got no food . \nThey are surviving through the generosity of others and by spending what little money they had saved . \n`` It is the only way we can exist , we have to borrow and rely on other people . \nWe have nothing at all - nothing .

'' \nSarah is the East and Central Africa disaster management officer for Tearfund - a relief and development charity - which sent a team out to Haiti on 17 January . \nThe Red Cross estimates that up to 50,000 people were killed and three million people affected by the earthquake , which hit 7.0 on the Richter Scale . \nSarah was in Haiti on 20 January when an aftershock hit , measuring 6.1 on the Richter Scale . \n`` It was at 6am in the morning so most people were still asleep , '' Sarah said . \n`` We were sleeping in tents and it was pretty scary because it was our first night here . \n`` To get woken up , when you 're still asleep , it takes a couple of seconds to register what is happening . \n`` There was an awful lot of noise because people were screaming - we just tried to get out of our tents quick enough to be safe . \n`` Fortunately where we are staying , there are not many buildings around . \nWe were fairly safe . \nMany people live in poorly constructed houses on hills in Haiti `` It was quite quick , about 10 seconds . \nYou could see the trauma of people . \nYou could see the panic . \n`` Obviously people who had experienced the big earthquake last week - all the trauma comes flooding back . \nThere were real moments of panic . \n`` More buildings collapsed as well and I heard of an orphanage nearby where hundreds of children died yesterday . \n`` The structures which had become unsafe in the big earthquake were so fragile , now further damage has been done . '' \nSarah , who is from the west Berkshire village of Woolhampton , has been in earthquakes in Indonesia during the Tsunami , but said the tremors in Haiti were still scary . \n`` I immediately knew what it was so I could quickly get out . \nBut it was pretty scary . \nLast night there were several small tremors . \n`` I was awake quite a lot last night anyway because there were quite a lot of gun shots , the noise of the helicopters and planes going over and just because everyone is sleeping outside there is so much noise . '' \nSarah explained that many people in Haiti were frightened and panicked . \n`` Fear is the big thing in terms of aftershocks . \nPeople are too scared to go back in the houses and because the houses are unstable anyway , it 's good they are not sleeping inside , but the trauma of the earthquake is there and the panic which so immediately sets in , is horrible . '' \nThe lack of basic amenities is still a big problem and aid is still very much needed . \n`` Food and water are still a big priority and fuel is hampering all operations because they are trying to get it to the people , '' Sarah said . \nThe Red Cross estimates that up to 50,000 have been killed `` Once we can get some fuel then that 's going to help the situation enormously . \n`` Tents are a big issue . \nIt has n't rained here since the earthquake which is amazing because it normally does rain here . \n`` There are about one million to 1.5 million people sleeping outside at the moment , if it rains , the situation is just going to be another disaster because of the spread of disease . \n`` There 's so much rubbish on the streets and obviously there is no sanitation at all , so if it rains , the sanitation situation is going to deteriorate very quickly .

As major news organizations published quotes from officials on what had happened , eyewitness accounts were being posted to Twitter . '' \nHaitian Fredo Dupoux posted one of the first recorded tweets at 17:00 local time . \n`` Oh shiet -LRB- sic -RRB- heavy earthquake right now ! \nIn Haiti '' , along with tweeter FutureHaiti who said `` Earthquake 7 Richter scale just happening #Haiti . '' \nhope all are ok Richard Morse - @RAMHaiti tweets from his hotel Foreign journalistic resources were thin on the ground when the quake struck in Haiti , often described as the poorest country in the Western hemisphere . \nThe only full-time correspondent was a reporter for the US Associated Press news agency . \nThe rest were local stringers and staff . \nRichard Morse , a musician who runs the Oloffson Hotel , an iconic building made famous as the Trianon in Graham Greene 's novel The Comedians , reported on 12 January that his hotel was still standing . \n`` We 're ok at the oloffson . \nhope all are ok . \na lot of big buildings in PAP are down '' . \nHaitian radio and TV host Carel Pedre was among the more prominent voices tweeting in the early hours following the quake . \nHe tweeted at 19:00 . \n`` If U need to To get in Touch with friends and family in Haiti . \nSend me a Private Message with names and phone numbers . \nI 'll get Back to U ! '' \nTroy Livesay , a US missionary , blogger and tweeter who lives in Haiti , posted some of the most moving tweets in a constantly updating flow of information . \nAt 1209 a.m. on 13 January he tweeted `` Church groups are singing throughout the city all through the night in prayer . \nIt is a beautiful sound in the middle of a horrible tragedy . '' \nThe Twitter community in fact provided much of the early information on the crisis in the existence of what the Columbia Journalism Review called `` the Haitian news vacuum '' . \nThe Los Angeles Times quickly created a list of Twitter users believed to be tweeting from Haiti and the New York Times blog The Lede began regularly updating a post with news about the quake . \nThe Lede 's editor said that `` Any readers who are in Haiti or in touch with people there are encouraged to use the comment thread below to share first-hand accounts with us '' . \nWe immediately moved someone supervising social media and our iReports to the Haiti desk Nick Wrenn , CNN International Digital Services Footage from YouTube , the hugely popular video-sharing site owned by Google , was used extensively by TV channels across the world in the immediate aftermath of the quake , in the absence of material from the main TV news agencies APTN and Reuters TV , and from individual broadcasters . \nA YouTube video at around 22:00 local time on 12 January from the American Red Cross appeared to be the first upload of news of the disaster . \nNight fell shortly after the quake struck , plunging Port-au-Prince into darkness , but after daybreak on 13 January hundreds of videos were being uploaded , some presenting harrowing pictures of dead and injured victims and others showing the extent of the devastation wreaked by the disaster . \nBroadcasters from around the world used this citizen-generated material in bulletins and rolling news programs , dramatically underlining the coming of age of new and emerging media as powerful news tools . \nThe broadcaster with the most material on the quake from such sources appeared to be CNN . \nVideo reports from citizen journalists come into the CNN iReport desk where they are vetted for verifiability by editorial staff . \nAround two years ago , the iReport section of CNN 's website , where people can upload video material and contact details , became a usable source for CNN when vetting procedures were put into place . \nNick Wrenn , of CNN International Digital Services said `` We immediately moved someone supervising social media and our iReports to the Haiti desk '' . \nOn 13 January , CNN 's iReport had 1.4 m page views , a 240 % increase over the last high recorded last year . \nAlong with other tweeters , Carel Pedre was also sending digital citizen photos of the destruction caused by the quake . \nMany of the images were graphic and disturbing , and appeared in mainstream newspapers and on TV channels shortly afterwards . \nPeople in Haiti uploaded images to the Yahoo-owned Flickr photo-sharing site , for example employees of a US-based NGO in Haiti ; a missionary in Archaie , Haiti ; and an internet company operator in Haiti . \nHowever , difficulties exist and care must be taken in identifying user-generated content , as many users also upload agency images to their photo-streams . \nAnsel Herz , an independent journalist on Skype By 13 January , the day after the quake , international news media were still struggling to enter Port-au-Prince . \nBut Skype , a software application that allows users to make voice calls over the internet , had by then been used to great effect to get urgent news out of Haiti . \nVia Skype , the BBC spoke to Ansel Herz , an independent journalist who had been in Petionville . \nHe told the BBC that an aftershock was happening as he spoke , and that `` many multi-storey buildings had fallen '' . \nThere was `` devastation everywhere , '' he said . \n`` People are coming together and helping others survive , '' he said , adding that `` not a lot in the way of help was coming from the authorities and the peacekeepers '' . \nHe told how he witnessed rescue efforts with pickaxes at the partially collapsed cathedral building , and how for people who were already poor `` it was difficult to describe the problems facing them '' . \nEvery minute , people have been posting more than 1,500 status updates on Facebook that contained the word ` Haiti ' Randi Zuckerberg , who manages non-profit initiatives for Facebook , on 14 January described in a post on the Facebook corporate blog how the Haiti quake had emphasised the internet 's critical role in `` connecting the world 's population in times of tragedy '' . \nThe social media site quickly launched a `` Global Relief on Facebook '' page where the more than 350 million people who use the service can `` educate themselves and find out how to help not only in Haiti but wherever disaster and misfortune may strike '' . \nZuckerberg added that moments after the quake struck , people around the world immediately sought to help with relief efforts and express their solidarity with the victims . \n`` Every minute , people have been posting more than 1,500 status updates on Facebook that contained the word ` Haiti ' . '' \n`` People have contributed thousands of dollars through the Causes application on Facebook , and groups including the American Red Cross , Oxfam America and Partners in Health have mobilised supporters through their Facebook pages and raised hundreds of thousands of dollars in the last 24 hours alone , '' he said in the post . \nAlong with its social networking functions , it is known that Facebook is also widely used as a primary news source by younger users . \nVideos were uploaded and shared and celebrities tweeted and spread the word While mainstream news organizations are now using social networking sites for news and information , technology and social media are being utilised more frequently in coping with the aftermath of natural disasters . \nFriends and relatives of victims searched for information using media tools like Twitter , Facebook , Skype , Flickr and YouTube for information and assistance . \nTexting , Facebook and Twitter campaigns kicked in to support the relief effort in the first hours of the crisis . \nThe social networking sites played a key role in mass mobilisation and raising millions of dollars . \nWriting on the suite101 . \ncom website , Jace Shoemaker-Galloway noted `` thousands of tweets , retweets and TwitPics were shared and viewed as the disaster unfolded . \nVideos were uploaded and shared and celebrities tweeted and spread the word '' . \nBy 15 January , Haitian musician Wyclef Jean had raised over US$ 1m for quake victims through his Yele Haiti foundation . \nHowever , reports inevitably came in of cyber scammers preying on popular generosity and compassion with bogus appeals aimed at enriching only themselves . \nText messaging campaigns facilitate the relief effort by enabling people to contribute financially in a simple way . \nFor example , Text HAITI to 90999 is a mobile phone fundraising initiative supported by the US State Department . \nPeople can make a donation to the Red Cross by sending a simple text message Millions of dollars have now reached the Red Cross , breaking records for a mobile giving campaign . \nthe world owes a measure of debt to new media platforms - which will undoubtedly continue to play an important role in Haiti in the days and months to come Curtis Barnard , Columbia Journalism Review blog Noting how mainstream media were relying on social networks to fill the gaps , US blog Gawker in the early stages of the crisis acknowledged the value of `` crowd sourcing '' in covering `` chaotic breaking news like this '' . \nBut it added : `` the true extent of the damage will not likely be known until news organizations get reporters on the ground - and off Facebook '' . \nAnd the dangers of using instant unchecked information were illustrated by footage that appeared of an earlier earthquake in Japan that purported to be from Haiti but obviously was not . \nBut Curtis Barnard , writing in the Columbia Journalism Review blog , said that nevertheless `` the world owes a measure of debt to new media platforms - which will undoubtedly continue to play an important role in Haiti in the days and months to come - for their assistance in facilitating the early response to this disaster '' . \nBBC Monitoring research 18 Jan 2010 \n"}
{"id": "1498", "time": "2010-01-22", "text": "Surgeons say the post-operative period will be critical Prosthetic organizations and charities worldwide have warned of the huge task facing Haiti as it struggles to rehabilitate hundreds of thousands of amputees resulting from the island 's earthquake . \nDoctors say they are already struggling to cope with the sheer numbers of people needing amputations after being trapped in rubble . \nSome surgeons estimate that as many as 200,000 Haitians will end up losing one or more limbs - in a country where the few rehabilitation facilities that existed before the earthquake have largely been destroyed . \nAnd in a country where an estimated 800,000 people were already living with disability before the disaster struck , meeting all the needs of the amputees may be impossible . \nDominic Hannett , director of clinical services at Opcare , a private company that provides prosthetic services to the NHS , says many more amputations will be carried out over the coming days and weeks because of potentially fatal infections in people , who had initially fairly minor wounds or fractures . \nThey will need to re-equip the rehabilitation center , find out who out of the staff is still alive and train more people and there are international guidelines on how to do that Sandra Sexton , University of Strathclyde And he warned infection will remain a major risk in those who have had surgery to remove parts of or whole limbs . \nHe said : `` It 's fairly common sense but the more someone loses of their limb , the more complex the amputation and prosthesis is going to be - if someone loses a leg at the hip , that 's a massive problem . '' \nProsthetic devices need to be fitted as soon as possible after healing to get people mobile and will need refitting in the first few weeks and after that at least once a year , he said . \n`` Amputation is a life-long rehabilitation - in the UK we still treat amputees from the Second World War because they need ongoing care . '' \nBut limbs are easy to make and the sheet of plastic needed to remould and fit a socket joint on a prosthetic costs as little as # 15 . \n`` The requirements for a prosthetics team to set up are fairly simple and local people can be trained to manufacture and provide prosthetics , '' he said . \nSandra Sexton , director of the National Centre for Prosthetics and Orthotics at the University of Strathclyde , said there were some rehabilitation services in Haiti , but like everything else they have been destroyed by the quake which killed 200,000 people , according to some estimates . \nMs Sexton added survival was currently the top priority for medical teams , but once the focus shifted to reconstruction , a vital step would be getting the local rehabilitation services up and running once again . \nIt is a gigantic and very serious problem and the post-amputation period will be critical in terms of post-operative support , physical therapy and the fitting of prostheses Eric Doubt , Healing Hands for Haiti `` What we saw after the Pakistan earthquake was the importance of having a co-ordinated approach - it 's about knowing who has had an amputation , and who is undergoing treatment . \n`` We know from places that have been in conflict , for example after the Ethiopian civil war , there was a very practical way forward . \n`` They -LRB- aid agencies -RRB- built rehab centres in five areas then they trained people up to do local provision but the local population there had not been as devastated as it has in Haiti and it 's going to be a lot more difficult . \n`` They will need to re-equip the rehabilitation center , find out who out of the staff is still alive and train more people . '' \nMs Sexton stressed the disaster in Haiti was of an `` unprecedented '' scale . \n`` This is devastation in a very poor country , '' she said . \n`` They had rehabilitation services before but they were n't even touching the sides and it 's hard to comprehend how to help - they really will need sustained long-term support . '' \nEric Doubt , executive director of Healing Hands for Haiti - a US-based charity set up 10 years ago to provide rehabilitation for people with disabilities - said three-quarters of their facilities in the country have been destroyed . \nThe charity is now accelerating plans to open Haiti 's first Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Institute later this year . \n`` We have 150 medical specialists , construction crew , translators and volunteers flying out next week , '' said Mr Doubt . \n`` Following that we will be joined by a team of 30 professionals from Handicap International . \n`` Whether that addresses all of the previous and new needs is highly unlikely , but we 'll be working in conjunction with all the other physical medicine and rehabilitation organizations who will also be setting up operations .

'' \nShe told me how JD Hill , one of the senior curators involved in the programs , gave her a piece of rock to hold . \nIt turned out to be a stone chopping tool , and was nearly two million years old - and as she inspected it more closely she could make out its multi-functional , albeit basic , design . \nAnd in the first program in the series , presenter Neil McGregor uses a replica of it to carve his roast chicken ! \nBeat that Apple - I bet none of your fancy iPhone applications can do that ! \nRajan Datar is the Presenter , Over To You Over To You is your chance to have your say about the BBC World Service and its programs . \nIt airs at 10:40 and 23:40 every Saturday , and at 02:40 on Sunday -LRB- GMT -RRB- . \nSend the team your feedback by email -LRB- overtoyou@bbc.co.uk -RRB- , telephone -LRB- 44144960900 0 -RRB- , SMS -LRB- 447786 202006 -RRB- or by leaving comments on this blog . \nNo comments to display yet . \nWelcome to the Over to You blog - the place where you can ask BBC World Service editors and program makers how and why we make the decisions that we do . \nWe need your comments - so please join in . \nFor the latest updates across BBC blogs , Subscribe to Over To You You can stay up to date with Over To You via these feeds . \nThese are some of the popular topics this blog covers . \n"}

either as a direct result of earthquake damage , or because they are blocked by rubble or smashed vehicles . \nSome aid agencies have been unable to get to their warehouses . \nRoads to the neighbouring Dominican Republic , though damaged , are open and the best option for the majority of incoming cargo . \nThe UN peacekeeping mission -LRB- Minustah -RRB- , which has around 3,000 troops and police in and around Port-au-Prince , is working to clear some of the major roads . \nRoad access between Port-au-Prince and Leogane - two of the worst affected areas - is reported to be good . \nBut key routes that are open are becoming congested with the movement of people and supplies . \nThe UN says the security situation is stable with a few reports of scuffles , looting and gunshots . \nSome rescue crews said they were forced to stop work at nightfall because of security concerns . \nResponsibility for maintaining law and order in the capital now rests with the UN mission 's international troops and police . \nHaiti has no army and its police force has all but collapsed in the aftermath of the earthquake . \nUN troops are providing military escort for UN agencies delivering aid and international NGOs have been advised to travel with escorts . \nThe US , which has sent thousands of troops to help the relief effort , is providing additional capacity at the request of the UN . \nBetween 500,000 and 700,000 people are believed to have been left homeless as a result of the earthquake , according to the UN 's latest estimates . \nMore than 500 makeshift camps have been identified by the Haitian government , which has requested large tents to set up reception centres for the homeless . \nAgencies have assessed 350 sites , which currently accommodate around 472,000 people . \nHowever , only six of these sites have access to water sources . \nThe Haitian government has identified six sites for camps outside of the city , such as land near Croix des Bouquets , and has suggested that these camps should be for 20,000 people each . \nEven before the earthquake only half of Haitians had access to clean water . \nNow most of the remaining water supply been cut off . \nAgencies have been working to provide water and sanitation to as many people as possible . \nOn 20 January , 755,000 litres of water were provided to 151,000 people as well as 7,000 bottles of water to hospitals , orphan centres and a police station . \nThe ICRC is providing clean water for more than 12,000 homeless people living in three camps . \nThe UN is particularly concerned about the situation in Cite Soleil , one of the capital 's poorest neighborhoods , where there is an acute shortage of water . \nSome bottled water is being brought from the Dominican Republic but far more supplies or purification kits are needed . \nThe USS Carl Vinson , docked off Haiti , is fitted with water-purifying equipment that can make 400,000 US gallons -LRB- 1.5 m litres -RRB- of drinking water a day . \nOther countries have sent mobile water purification units , which can convert contaminated water from wells and streams into drinking water . \nThe UN has set up a `` Food Aid Cluster '' to meet the needs of two million hungry people . \nThe World Food Programme -LRB- WFP -RRB- has four fully operational distribution sites - in Champs de Mars , Petionville Club and two sites in Delmas and the number of sites is expected to increase . \nWFP has provided around three million meals to more than 200,000 people since the start of the emergency response - each person getting a five-day ration . \nMost were distributed in the Port-au-Prince area , but also in Jacmel , Leogane , Jeremie , Bainet and Gonaives . \nThe UN says the aim is to distribute 10 million meals over the next week , reaching 100,000 people a day . \nOne thousand metric tons of ready-to-eat meals will arrive in Port-au-Prince on 27 January . \nSeven US military helicopters are being used to support aid distributions in areas around the capital . \nThe leading US general in Haiti has said it is a `` reasonable assumption '' that up to 200,000 people could have died in last Tuesday 's earthquake . \nLt Gen Ken Keen said the disaster was of `` epic proportions '' , but it was `` too early to know '' the full human cost . \nThe disposal of dead bodies has been a key priority for the relief effort . \nThe bodies of thousands of victims have been piling up in the streets and outside hospitals . \nMany more remain trapped beneath rubble . \nMore than 80,000 dead people are reported to have been buried , many of them in mass graves . \nThe presidential palace , the parliament and many government buildings have collapsed , hampering an already weak central government . \nUN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon says the agency is co-ordinating relief work with Haitian President Rene Preval , and that government agencies , including the police services , are now regrouping . \nMr Preval has increased the number of working groups and is designating official group leaders who will liaise with the UN . \nAn information hub has also been set up at Judicial Police headquarters in Port-au-Prince . \nThe UN mission has set up an operations center at the airport to co-ordinate the work of around 26 international search and rescue teams . \nIt says no more urban rescue teams are appropriate at this stage . \nSeveral relief agencies ' offices , including the UN 's , are damaged and their staff dead or missing . \nCo-ordination efforts are also being hampered by frequent power cuts and communications outages . \nThe US naval ship Comfort is a fully-equipped `` floating hospital '' UN health specialists say at least eight hospitals or health centres in the capital collapsed or suffered severe damage . \nMost public and private hospitals still standing were stretched to the limit in the immediate aftermath , with not enough staff to handle the hundreds of wounded waiting at their gates , the Red Cross said . \nMany of the injuries have been appalling . \nInternational surgeons have been carrying out an average of about 50 amputations a day . \nField hospitals have been set up by teams from Russia , Israel , Colombia , Jordan and Brazil - including some with resources to perform neurological , orthopaedic , maxial-facial and general surgery . \nHelicopters have also been ferrying the wounded to hospitals in nearby countries . \nThe US hospital ship , USNS Comfort , with 500 medical personnel and 250 beds onboard , arrived in Port-au-Prince harbor on 20 January and has treated more than 230 people . \n"}

and women say they have been raped by gang members . \nThe police chief would n't say who he was appealing to for help , but his plea is clearly aimed at , first , the US troops who have just arrived here , and , second , the UN forces that have been stationed in Haiti for several years . \nAt least 75,000 bodies have so far been buried in mass graves , Haiti 's government has said . \nMany more remain uncollected in the streets . \nAt least 122 people have been saved by international search-and-rescue teams , according to the US government , but hopes are now fading that anyone will be found alive underneath the rubble . \nA Florida-based team is reported to have left , along with others from Luxembourg and the UK . \n`` You have to be realistic and , after nine days , reality says it is more difficult to find people alive . \nBut it 's not impossible , '' said Chilean Army Major Rodrigo Vasquez at the site of the collapsed Montana Hotel . \nEven as the aid operation remains the focus of events in Haiti , a leading UK medical journal has issued a sharp critique of the way aid agencies have been operating . \nIn an editorial , The Lancet says many of the international aid agencies operating in Haiti might be doing more harm than good by promoting themselves rather than working for the common humanitarian goal . \nThe Lancet says the aid industry has become too obsessed with media campaigns , despite past mistakes during the response to the Asian tsunami five years ago . \nLancet editor , Dr Richard Horton , told the BBC there was no effective common leadership of humanitarian workers in Haiti , as many non-governmental organizations were competing against each other . \nAt least 500,000 people are currently living outdoors in 447 improvised camps in Port-au-Prince , according to the International Organisation for Migration -LRB- IOM -RRB- . \nTents will not work in May when the long rainy season begins and later when hurricane season starts , but at this point there is not much choice Vincent Houver , International Organisation for Migration Of the 350 settlements assessed by the IOM , its partners and the Haitian government , only 179 had improvised shelter material and tents , and only three had access to potable water , the IOM said . \nThe Geneva-based UN body said it was distributing tents , blankets and plastic sheeting provided by the US , Japan and Turkey , but warned that more permanent shelter would soon be needed . \n`` Tents will not work in May when the long rainy season begins and later when hurricane season starts , but at this point there is not much choice , '' said IOM Chief of Mission Vincent Houver . \n`` Assessments must take place and best construction methods and durable materials need to be discussed , '' he added . \nIn a bid to deliver greater quantities of aid , the US military is now operating at four airports in the area - Port-au-Prince and Jacmel in Haiti , and San Isidro and Barahona in the neighbouring Dominican Republic . \nBill Clinton and Ban Ki-moon have spoken of their long-term commitment to Haiti The head of the US Southern Command , Gen Douglas Fraser , said 1,400 flights were on a waiting list for landing slots at Port-au-Prince 's airport , which can handle 120 to 140 flights a day . \nThe airport , which is under US military control , has only one 2,900 m -LRB- 9,600 ft -RRB- runway . \nThe US military is currently giving the `` highest priority '' to shipments of water donations to help meet the `` overwhelming '' need for water . \nMedecins Sans Frontieres -LRB- MSF -RRB- has said five of its planes carrying a total of 77 tonnes of medical and relief supplies have been turned away in the past week . \nOnly one has been able to land . \nSecurity concerns are also limiting the delivery of aid by road from the Dominican Republic . \nThe BBC 's Gary Duffy , who is at the border with Haiti , says only two convoys guarded by UN troops are entering Haiti each day . \nThe US and the UN World Food Programme insist the distribution of food and water is well under way , but BBC correspondents in Port-au-Prince say many people have still seen no international relief at all . \n"}

from search and rescue teams and medical aid , to food aid and then longer-term rebuilding of infrastructure . \nThe US is mobilising a huge military and civilian aid effort as President Barack Obama pledged a `` swift , co-ordinated and aggressive '' to save lives . \nHe put the US international development agency - USAID in charge of co-ordinating the country 's aid effort . \nMilitary overflights have been assessing damage and civilian disaster assistance teams have begun arriving . \nThe US military had ordered an aircraft carrier and three ships , including one which can carry up to 2,000 US Marines , to head for Haiti , officials said . \nThe Americans are playing a key role in central co-ordination on the ground in Haiti - largely because they have more functioning infrastructure than anyone else . \nThe US embassy in the capital Port-au-Prince is intact ; communications equipment for rescue teams has been flown in . \nHaitian communities in the US itself - including south Florida where an estimated 275,000 Haitians live - are also organising donations and relief efforts . \nSeveral international aid agencies have offices and staff in Haiti , usually working on long-term aid and reconstruction . \nIt is already evident that this is an extremely serious situation , the long-term effects of which are going to need substantial support They began mobilising emergency teams in response to the quake . \nOxfam says it has staff ready , including a public health , water and sanitation team in the capital , Port-au-Prince . \nThe organization also had emergency supplies in Panama which could be taken in , a spokesman said . \nThe International Red Cross says it is releasing emergency funds to help deal with the disaster . \nRed Cross warehouses in Port-au-Prince which survived the earthquake had basic aid for about 10,000 families and a further 20,000 aid kits are being transported from Panama , a spokesman said . \nThe British Red Cross has launched an appeal in the UK and has released # 200,000 -LRB- $ 325,000 -RRB- from its disaster fund to ensure money is immediately available . \nThe international humanitarian group , Medecins Sans Frontieres -LRB- MSF -RRB- , said many people in Port-au-Prince had sought medical help , and that it had set up makeshift clinics offering basic care as its buildings had been seriously damaged . \nMSF plans to send dozens more staff to Haiti to help workers based there . \nUN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said $ 10m would be released immediately from the world body 's central emergency response fund to assist aid efforts . \nHe said an emergency appeal for additional funds from member states would follow . \nBill Clinton : '' What we need now is food , water , supplies '' The UN World Food Programme - which already runs extensive feeding operations in the country - said it would begin distributing high energy biscuits , which require no preparation before being consumed . \nThe WFP also said it would airlift 86 metric tons of food from its emergency hub in El Salvador , enough for 30,000 people in urgent need to be fed for up to seven days . \n`` In a normal day the World Food Programme will be feeding one or two million people in Haiti - and now we need to do even more , because the people have lost everything , '' a spokeswoman said . \nThe UN stabilisation force in Haiti , Minustah , has said about 100 or more of its staff are still unaccounted for after buildings collapsed . \nThe Minustah mission has more than 9,000 police and troops stationed in Haiti , as well as 488 international civilian staff and local staff . \nIts forces are drawn from more than 40 countries , including Brazil , China and Pakistan . \nSeveral Minustah nations have said they are preparing to send aid . \nThe UN has set up a logistics center at Haiti 's main airport . \nFrance , which has historic links with Haiti and some 1,400 nationals living there , is sending two planes with rescuers and humanitarian aid , one from the Caribbean island of Martinique and a second one with aid experts from Marseille . \nIt also plans to evacuate about 60 injured people . \nFrench civil safety authorities said a total of 130 rescuers , doctors and nurses as well as trained rescue dogs were due to arrive in Haiti , with 12 tonnes of aid and rescue material . \nPeter Stevenson is Operations Commander for the UK 's International Search and Rescue Team The UK government said it was `` deeply concerned '' by the earthquake and has a team flying out to Haiti . \nA 71-strong team of British firefighters is due in Haiti to help rescue efforts . \nSpain has pledged $ 4.3 m -LRB- 3m euros -RRB- and says it has 150 tonnes of humanitarian aid ready for delivery . \nThe country has offered the EU the use of its humanitarian base in Panama to ferry in help . \nGermany has released $ 2.18 n -LRB- 1.5 m euros -RRB- in aid and has sent an immediate response team . \nThe Netherlands has donated $ 2.9 m -LRB- 2m euros -RRB- and Belgium , Sweden and Luxembourg are offering water purification equipment , tents , medical help and search-and-rescue experts . \nItaly has prepared a military transport plane which will be used to take in a field hospital and emergency medical team . \nThe European Union says it has activated all `` crisis and aid management mechanisms '' and the European Commission has released $ 4.3 m -LRB- 3m euros -RRB- in emergency assistance , the maximum for an emergency procedure . \nThe President of the EU , Herman van Rompuy , said `` the EU stands ready to offer its assistance in any possible way '' . \nIsrael is sending an army rescue unit , including engineers , doctors and other medical staff . \nChina is to donate $ 1m , according to Xinhua News Agency . \nVenezuela said it was sending a military plane with food , medicine and drinking water , as well as a team of 50 rescue workers . \nCuba , which also felt the quake , has sent 30 doctors . \nCuban field hospitals in Port-au-Prince were already treating hundreds of injured , according to Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez . \nCanada has said it is sending a 20-person reconnaissance team to assess aid needs . \nMexico , which has long experience of dealing with devastating earthquakes , is sending a team of doctors and search and rescue workers and infrastructure damage experts . \nThe Inter-American Development Bank -LRB- IADB -RRB- is providing $ 200,000 -LRB- # 122,000 -RRB- in immediate emergency aid which can be used to provide food , potable water , medicines and temporary shelter . \nThe World Bank , whose local offices were destroyed in the earthquake , is planning to send a team to assess damage . \nIt has announced an extra $ 100m in emergency aid for Haiti , to help with recovery and reconstruction . \n"}

'' \nNormally held in the run up to Christmas , the last time the Black Santa appeal was extended was in 2004 , when it raised # 1.6 m for the tsunami victims . \nThe 7.0-magnitude quake , Haiti 's worst in two centuries , struck on Tuesday , just 15km -LRB- 10 miles -RRB- south-west of Port-au-Prince and close to the surface . \nDean McKelvey said that developing countries found it harder to recover from natural disasters and that they would work with Christian charities and international relief agencies to help distribute aid . \nHe said he had been contacted by people who wanted to use the cathedral as a means to help . \n`` I think it will be a bit different from the tsunami appeal , people had visited Thailand and Sri Lanka on holidays , '' he said . \n`` When we were collecting for that disaster people would tell us about their trips to south east Asia . \n`` Because of the political situation , and the general state of the country in the past I do n't believe we will be getting that this time . '' \nThere will be no sit-out , however , with the assistants to the dean during the fundraising effort having returned to their parish duties . \nThe barrel for donations will remain inside the front door of the cathedral and cathedral stewards and staff will welcome visitors making donations . \nThe Christmas sit out this year raised just over # 250,000 for local charities . \n"}

'' \nEarlier , bodies white with dust could be seen piled on the back of a pick-up truck as vehicles tried to ferry the injured to hospital . \nHaiti is the poorest country in the western hemisphere and has suffered a number of recent disasters , including four hurricanes and storms in 2008 that killed hundreds . \nIn a statement issued in New York , the UN said that its local HQ in Haiti had `` sustained serious damage along with other UN installations '' and `` a large number '' of personnel were missing . \nCarel Pedre , TV and radio presenter , Port-au-Prince I saw a lot of people crying for help , a lot of buildings collapsed , a lot of car damage , a lot of people without help , people bleeding . \nI saw a movie theater , a supermarket , a cybercafe , an apartment building which collapsed . \nNow it 's dark outside , there is no electricity , all the phone networks are down , so there 's no way that people can get in touch with their family and friends . \nThere are aftershocks every 15 to 20 minutes . \nThey last from three to five seconds . \nThe first shock was really strong , people were falling in the streets and buildings collapsed . \nI did n't see any emergency services , the people at the neighborhood were trying to help each other . \nThe streets are narrow and there is lot of traffic and everyone is trying to reach family and friends . \nTraffic now is really difficult . \nPeople do n't know where to go or where to start . \nUN peacekeeping chief Alain Le Roy said it was unclear how many people were in the building . \nThe head of the UN mission in Haiti , Hedi Annabi , was reported to have been inside and is unaccounted for . \nFrench Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said he was believed to be dead . \nThe UN 's stabilisation mission plays a vital role in ensuring security in Haiti . \nRaymond Joseph , Haiti 's ambassador to the US , said the presidential palace , the tax office , the ministry of commerce and the foreign ministry had all been damaged , but the airport was intact . \nHe and Haiti 's ambassador to Mexico , Robert Manuel , both said that President Rene Preval and his wife had survived the quake . \nThe World Bank said its local offices were destroyed but most of the staff were accounted for , Reuters reported . \nUS President Barack Obama said his `` thoughts and prayers '' were with the people of Haiti and that he expected `` an aggressive , coordinated -LRB- aid -RRB- effort by the US government '' . \nVenezuela says it will send a 50-strong `` humanitarian assistance team '' . \nPopulation of 10 million people Most live on less than $ 2 a day Democratic rule restored in 2006 Economy in ruins and unemployment is chronic UN peacekeepers deployed - foreign aid seen as vital Massive deforestation has left just 2 % forest Storms and hurricanes in 2008 left almost 800 dead The Inter-American Development Bank said it was immediately approving a $ 200,000 grant for emergency aid . \nThe UK said it was mobilising help and was `` ready to provide whatever humanitarian assistance may be required '' . \nCanada , Australia , France and a number of Latin American nations have also said they are mobilising their aid response . \nPope Benedict XVI has called for a generous response to the `` tragic situation '' in Haiti . \nIn the minutes after the quake , Henry Bahn , a visiting official from the US Department of Agriculture , said he had seen houses which had tumbled into a ravine . \n`` Everybody is just totally , totally freaked out and shaken , '' said Mr Bahn , who described the sky as `` just gray with dust '' . \nHe said he had been walking to his hotel room when the ground began to shake . \n`` I just held on and bounced across the wall , '' he said . \n`` I just heard a tremendous amount of noise and shouting and screaming in the distance . '' \nReports on the Twitter message site , which can not yet be verified by the BBC , expressed the chaos in the wake of the quake . \nTweets from troylivesay spoke of the worst damage being in the Carrefour district , where `` many two and three storey buildings did not make it '' . \nIn the immediate aftermath of the quake , a tsunami watch was put out for Haiti , Cuba and the Bahamas , but this was later lifted . \nHave you been affected by the earthquake ? \nIf you have any information you wish to share with the BBC you can do so using the form below : You can send pictures and video to yourpics@bbc.co.uk, text them to +447725100100 or if you have a large file you can click here to upload . \nThe BBC may edit your comments and not all emails will be published . \nYour comments may be published on any BBC media worldwide . \n"}

'' \n2349 The BBC 's Laura Trevelyan in New York spoke to Haitians living in the Brooklyn district of Haiti Town : `` Haitians here are in shock . \nTheir community has suffered so much - political violence , hurricanes , and now this . \nRico Dupuis of Radio Soleil says Haiti is more in need of help than ever before . \n` Of all the calamities we 've faced over the years , this is the mother of all of them . \nPort-au-Prince will never be the same again . \nI do n't see how Haiti can recover from all of this , ' he says . \nVigils are being organised , money is being collected , food is being parcelled up , as Haitians here respond to this tragedy . \nWhat makes it all the harder to bear , is that for once people felt their country was entering a period of relative stability . '' \n2332 Haiti 's neighbors in the Caribbean reacted swiftly to news of the earthquake , with first response coming overnight from the Bahamas and the Dominican Republic which sent in medical supplies and search and a rescue response teams . \nThe new chairman of Caricom , Dominica Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit , called the quake gut-wrenching . \nRegional leaders pledged immediate assistance and a contingent from the Caribbean Disasters Emergency Management Agency was expected to arrive in Haiti on Wednesday evening . \nGrenada 's Prime Minister , Tillman Thomas , told the BBC natural disasters like hurricanes meant the region was best placed to understand Haiti 's immediate needs . \n2313 US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has decided to cancel the remainder of her trip to the Pacific and return to Washington because of the earthquake in Haiti . \nShe had been scheduled to visit Papua New Guinea , New Zealand and Australia . \n2309 The BBC 's Andy Gallacher says : `` I 've just arrived at Port-au-Prince airport and aid is now coming in , but very slowly indeed . \nThere are just a few US Coast Guard and a couple of military planes here . \nBut help is desperately needed . \nIt is difficult to tell if the reports of tens of thousands of casualties are accurate at the moment . \nThere is no power here , and very poor infrastructure . '' \nJovenel Presume , Massachusetts , US , emails : Since the quake , I have lost all communication with my family . \nMy mum is there . \nShe was due to fly back today . \nI have a few friends , and family members who are willing to go out there in the rubble to search for people that are still alive . \n2244 Canada 's Governor General , Michaelle Jean , urges her former compatriots in Haiti to `` stand firm '' . \n`` Like me , Haitian communities across Canada are heartbroken and overwhelmed by the magnitude of this catastrophe , '' said Ms Jean , who was born in Port-au-Prince , but who fled Haiti with her family when she was 11 . \n`` The images and news reports are unbearable to watch . \nSo much distress , suffering and loss . \nWe are also , of course , imagining the worst , situations no image can capture that only increase our feeling of helplessness . '' \n2231 The BBC 's Matthew Price at Port-au-Prince 's airport says : `` We have just touched down . \nAirport workers said the situation was very serious indeed . \nThey did tell me that there had been no sign of government help , or of international help . \nAs we landed , we did see large numbers of people huddled together in makeshift shelters . '' \n2224 The US Coast Guard has posted videos taken from a helicopter during a flight over Port-au-Prince on Wednesday . \nThey show the aftermath of the earthquake and thousands of people on the capital 's streets , but no cars . \nAerial footage of the destruction in Haiti 2207 The Wall Street Journal says the earthquake will devastate Haiti 's $ 7bn economy , which was already struggling to emerge from several natural disasters and decades of political instability . \nThe country , where 80 % of the population lives below the poverty line , has yet to recover from four hurricanes in 2008 which wiped out roughly 15 % of its GDP . \n`` If the hurricanes were a blow , for this I would have to invent some other word , '' Ludovic Comeau , a native of Haiti and economics professor at DePaul University , tells the paper . \n2200 The commander of the first US ship to reach Port-au-Prince has described a scene of extraordinary devastation , with collapsed buildings reaching from the coast into the hills above . \nCmdr Diane Durham of the Coast Guard cutter , Forward , told the New York Times : `` It is hard to look out in this harbor and see a building that has not been affected ... Everybody in this city has been hit . '' \n2155 The World Bank says it will provide an additional $ 100m in emergency funds to Haiti and is considering a special reconstruction trust fund so donors can co-ordinate aid . \n`` This is a shocking event and it is crucial that the international community supports the Haitian people at this critical time , '' says the bank 's president , Robert Zoellick . \n`` The World Bank is mobilising significant financial assistance and sending a team to help assess damage and reconstruction needs . '' \n2143 The FBI warns potential donors of earthquake relief funds to `` apply a critical eye and do their due diligence before responding to those requests '' . \n`` Past tragedies and natural disasters have prompted individuals with criminal intent to solicit contributions purportedly for a charitable organization and\\/or a good cause , '' it says . \n2120 The BBC 's Barbara Plett at the UN in New York says : `` The UN is being extremely cautious about casualty figures because information is still sketchy . \nThe head of mission remains unaccounted for and the Secretary General , Ban Ki-moon , is sending the deputy chief of peacekeeping operations , Edmond Mulet , to oversee rescue and relief efforts . \nAn emergency response team is also expected on the ground shortly and a flash appeal for funds will be launched in the next few days . '' \n2112 Susana Malcorra , the head of the UN department of field support , confirms that at least 14 UN personnel have been killed - three Jordanian and 11 Brazilian peacekeepers , and one Haitian civilian . \nFifty-six are injured , seven of whom have been evacuated . \nShe tells reporters that there will likely be far more fatalities . \n2057 In a moving report on its website , Haitian Radio Metropole describes the devastation : `` The streets of Port-au-Prince are nothing more than a gaping wound , where corpses are tangled with the remains of houses , shops ... Schools and hospitals crumble , people are buried under the tons of rubble , or are waiting for a charitable hand that will come to their aid , and while this is happening , the looters are at work in the shops . \nSome people have lost their children , others their parents . \nHaiti has new orphans . \nToday it is very difficult to maintain hope , but as the saying goes , hope makes us live , so let us all join hands and keep hope alive . '' \nHaiti 's Prime Minister says more than 100,000 people may have been killed 2050 Haiti 's President , Rene Preval , tells CNN he has heard that between 30,000 and 50,000 people were killed by the earthquake . \nHe did not say where the estimates had come from . \n2044 A company in Miami working with the Haitian singer , Wyclef Jean , to collect donations in the US via text message says that the Yele Haiti foundation `` has raised more than $ 250,000 in donations for the catastrophe in less than 12 hours of going live and aims to raise over $ 1 million a day '' , according to the New York Times . \n2040 Officials at the US Department of Homeland Security says it has halted the deportation of Haitians living in the US illegally . \nThose who were due to be deported will remain in US detention centres . \n2034 The US televangelist , Pat Robertson , claims the reason for Haiti 's misfortunes is that the nation `` swore a pact to the devil '' two centuries ago . \n`` They were under the heal of the French ... And they got together and swore a pact to the devil . \nThey said , we will serve you if you will get us free from the French ... And they kicked the French out . \nYou know , the Haitians revolted and got themselves free . \nBut ever since they have been cursed by one thing after the other , '' he tells the Christian Broadcast Network . \n2021 President Rene Preval says the head of the UN mission in Haiti , Hedi Annabi , was killed in the earthquake when its headquarters in Port-au-Prince collapsed . \nThe UN has yet to confirm the death . \n2005 Paris Hilton , Ben Stiller , Chris Martin and Lindsay Lohan are among the celebrities and artists urging support for victims of the earthquake in Haiti . \nColdplay singer Martin says that when he visited Haiti with the charity Oxfam a few years ago he found a country `` of extreme poverty and brutal living conditions '' . \nThe earthquake , he says , has probably turned Port-au-Prince `` into an unimaginable hell '' . \n1959 The earthquake has brought devastation to other parts of Haiti besides Port-au-Prince . \nGuido Cornale , a Unicef representative in the southern city of Jacmel , says a lot of buildings that have collapsed completely or partially . \n`` We are still assessing the damage but we estimate that about 20 % of Jacmel , if not more ... has been destroyed '' he says , adding that city has a population of 50,000 . \nThe BBC 's Mike Wooldridge says : There have been repeated tragedies of this kind in Haiti - the first state in the Caribbean to become independent back in the 19th Century but also one of the world 's most impoverished nations . \nIt has a history of dictatorship , violent power struggles during the last decade , a notoriously high level of criminality - all this has compounded the vulnerability of women and children particularly . \nThat is why there is there is already a substantial humanitarian operation in Haiti - facing its greatest test . \n1920 Jean Marc Lafitte , Dominican Republic , emails : My family are all safe , but they are devastated . \nThey said that all the buildings are down , a lot of people are hurt and everything 's covered in dust - they say the country is ruined . \n1910 The British Red Cross in Haiti has set up a Flickr picture gallery , showing pictures taken around Haiti . \n1901 US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton says she will shorten her trip to Asia because of the earthquake . \n`` It is biblical , the tragedy that continues to stalk Haiti and the Haitian people , '' she tells reporters in Hawaii , according to the AFP news agency . \n1858 Edwidge Danticat , an award-winning Haitian-American author based in Miami , tells the Associated Press she is unable to contact her relatives . \n`` You want to go there , but you just have to wait , '' she says . \n`` Life is already so fragile in Haiti , and to have this on such a massive scale , it 's unimaginable how the country will be able to recover from this . '' \n1849 The Caribbean Community -LRB- Caricom -RRB- says its member states are `` ready to assist our brothers and sisters '' in Haiti . \n`` While we are very encouraged by the many expressions of international support that are already pouring in to Haiti , Caricom as a region also intends to play its part , '' it says , according to the Caribbean Media Corporation . \nTroy Livesay , Port-au-Prince , blogs : Thousands of people are currently trapped . \nTo guess at a number would be like guessing at raindrops in the ocean . \nPrecious lives hang in the balance . \nWhen pulled from the rubble there is no place to take them for care . \nI can not imagine what the next few weeks and months will be like . \nI am afraid for everyone . \n1839 Canadian diplomats are racing to get help to a Canadian citizen trapped in the rubble in Haiti who managed to send out a text message to the foreign ministry 's operations center in Ottawa , Foreign Minister Lawrence Cannon says . \n`` We know exactly where that individual is , '' he adds . \nMr Cannon says there have so far been no reports of any Canadian casualties . \n1828 Between 115 and 200 UN expatriate personnel in Haiti are still missing , a spokeswoman for the Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs tells the AFP news agency . \n`` We are also very worried about our local staff , '' Elisabeth Byrs says . \nThe UN headquarters in Port-au-Prince was destroyed by the earthquake 1817 Meinie Nicolai , director of operations at Medecins Sans Frontieres in Brussels , tells the BBC World Service that three of its health centres in Haiti have been partially destroyed . \n`` Up till now we have received just fewer than 1,000 people . \nSome even came to our office building to be cared for . \nWe are seeing patients with fractures and trauma . \nThe situation is dramatic and chaotic . \nWe do n't know how many are wounded and dead but the situation is serious ? \nWe are flying in 80 tonnes of extra material with an inflatable hospital ... There are plenty of problems , '' she says . \nThomas Chadwick , Florida , US , emails : I have an orphanage in Jacmel with 13 children . \nMy wife is out there , but I have n't been able to speak to any of them since an hour before the earthquake . \nI feel so useless . \n1808 The UN 's Emergency Relief Co-ordinator , John Holmes , says a Chinese search and rescue team has arrived in Port-au-Prince . \nTeams are also on their way from the US , France , Iceland and the Dominican Republic . \n`` Help is beginning to arrive , but of course it is desperately needed and as you are all aware every hour counts in this kind of situation where people are trapped under the rubble and desperately in need of being rescued , '' he says . \n1756 UK Foreign Office Minister , Baroness Kinnock , says officials working hard to locate and contact British nationals in Haiti and that the UK is ready to work with the Haitian government and international partners to respond to the crisis . \n`` We are in close contact with our honorary consul in Port-au-Prince . \nDespite major communications challenges , she is working hard to help locate British nationals and provide further information on the situation on the ground . \nAt present , we have no reports of any British casualties , '' she says . \nMany people live in poorly constructed housing on steep slopes in Haiti 1750 Mister Berube , a Canadian living in Haiti , tells the BBC World Service what happened to his hotel : `` I was in my office checking out some paperwork and the whole building felt like a boat in a storm . \nWe ran out of the doors and saw clouds of dust all over the place . \nEveryone managed to get out . \nWe were so nervous we stayed outside all night without gas and electricity . \nI have some neighbors who have lost everything . \nWe are not used to waiting for emergency help - in Haiti we usually try to sort out emergencies ourselves . '' \n1740 The BBC 's Nick Caistor says : Haiti appears to have had more than its fair share of chaos , poverty and natural disasters . \nAnd , as has happened so often in the nation 's past , just when the situation was getting better , a fresh catastrophe struck . \n1733 US Agency for International Development -LRB- USAID -RRB- administrator Rajiv Shah says Washington is `` committed to a significant effort '' . \n`` We will be pushing forward with an aggressive and co-ordinated effort focused very much on saving lives through aggressive search and rescue in the urban environment for the next 72 hours , which will be our primary focus of our engagement , '' he tells reporters . \nThe US said the priority for the first 72 hours was saving lives melindayiti tweets : talking to Joe in Jacmel ... says the city is destroyed , the Alcibiade is missing a part , the Hotel Lamandou ... many places damaged ... the hospital also seriously damaged and turning people away ... the ocean receded a half mile from the coast 1723 Haiti 's Prime Minister , Jean Max Bellerive , tells CNN that the death toll could be `` well over 100,000 '' . \n`` I hope that is not true , because I hope the people had the time to get out . \nBecause we have so many people on the streets right now , we do n't know exactly where they were living . \nBut so many , so many buildings , so many neighborhoods totally destroyed , and some neighborhoods we do n't even see people , so I do n't know where those people are , '' he says . \nMissionmanna , an aid group working in Haiti , have posted pictures on Tweet Photo showing the devastation . \n1707 The US state department says it has ordered about 80 non-essential embassy personnel , as well as dependents to leave Haiti , so the mission can focus on helping victims of the earthquake . \nEve Hayes de Kalaf , Santo Domingo , Dominican Republic , emails : The earthquake was felt here by a large number of the population , especially in the south of the country . \nThis sent many people into a state of panic -LRB- and they -RRB- ran from their homes and stayed outside , although damage to buildings was minimal . \nIt is only this morning that many of us have woken up to the reality of the situation . \nMany of my friends and colleagues work in Haiti . \nAt present we have had very little contact with them as most lines of communication are down . \nI fear that many people who work for international aid agencies have been killed . \n1656 Pope Benedict XVI appeals for support for those affected by the earthquake and says the Catholic Church will `` immediately activate '' it charitable institutions to reach those in need . \n`` I appeal to everyone 's generosity , so that these brothers and sisters of ours who are living through a time of need and pain receive our concrete solidarity and the effective help of the international community , '' he says . \n1651 The UN says the main prison in Port-au-Prince has collapsed , according to the Associated Press . \nInmates have reportedly escaped . \nEmmet Murphy , Jacmel , Haiti , emails : I was driving through the mountains when the car started to shake . \nIt was like a very strong wind was blowing and I nearly lost control of the car . \nRocks started falling on the road . \nI continued driving slowly and I saw people in the road screaming . \nThe mountain was collapsing and a building to one side had already fallen down . \nA huge dust plume raised from the valley floor . \nI drove further and found the road totally blocked by a massive

Scientist magazine , a group of scientists from the US and Jamaica predicted in 2008 that a magnitude-7 .2 earthquake would result if all of the strain along the Enriquillo-Plaintain Garden fault zone in southern Haiti was `` released in a single event '' . \nTuesday 's earthquake was 7.0 . \nPaul Mann , who was one of the scientists who gave the warning , said Haiti was particularly vulnerable to

Salvation Army in Haiti tells the New York Times that after the earthquake `` thousands of people poured out into the streets , crying , carrying bloody bodies , looking for anyone who could help them '' . \n`` We piled as many bodies into the back of our truck , and took them down the hill with us , hoping to find medical attention . \nAll of them were older , scared , bleeding , and terrified . \nAll of the children , and hundreds of neighbors , are sleeping in our playground area tonight . \nOccasionally , there is another tremor - another reminder that we are not yet finished with this calamity . \nAnd when it comes , all of the people cry out and the children are terrified , '' he says . \nBefore and after pictures of the presidential palace 1623 Haiti 's First Lady , Elisabeth

{"id": "809", "time": "2010-01-13", "text": "It was immediately obvious that Tuesday 's quake in Haiti would be an appalling natural disaster . \nThis was a large tremor centred on an impoverished country with little recent experience or preparedness for such an event . \nThe buildings in the quake zones of major industrialised nations sit on damping systems that allow them to ride out tremors that not only shake them back and forth but also twist them in the same movement . \nThe simplest concrete structures in the capital of Port-au-Prince will have crumpled under the same strain . \nSeismometers recorded a preliminary magnitude of 7.0 at 1653 local time -LRB- 2153 GMT -RRB- . \nThe epicentre 's proximity to Port-au-Prince - 15km -LRB- 10 miles -RRB- - and the focus -LRB- or depth -RRB- of just 8km -LRB- 5 miles -RRB- will have ensured the destructive forces were at their most intense . \n`` Closeness to the surface is a major factor contributing to the severity of ground shaking caused by an earthquake of any given magnitude , '' said Dr David Rothery , a planetary scientist with the Open University , UK . \n`` Furthermore , shaking tends to be greatest directly above the source . \nIn this case the epicentre was only 15 km from the center of the capital , Port au Prince , which therefore suffered very heavily . '' \nA series of strong aftershocks - more than 10 larger than Magnitude 5.0 - will have compounded the devastation . \nIn 1946 , a M8 .1 quake hit the Dominican Republic , which shares the island of Hispaniola , and produced a tsunami that killed almost 2,000 people . \nThe last major earthquake in this part of Haiti was 150 years ago . \nThe greater geological setting is the northern boundary between the Caribbean and North America tectonic plates where vast slabs of the Earth 's surface grind past each other in a horizontal motion . \nThe Caribbean plate appears to shift eastward with respect to the North America plate by about 20mm per year . \nIn the region where this quake occurred , this motion is accommodated across a number of strike-slip faults , the two main ones in Haiti being the Septentrional fault in the north and the Enriquillo-Plaintain Garden fault in the south . \nSeismic data suggests Tuesday 's quake was on the Enriquillo-Plaintain Garden fault . \n`` It 's been locked solid for about the last 250 years , '' said Dr Roger Musson from the British Geological Survey -LRB- BGS -RRB- . \n`` It 's been gathering stress all that time as the plates move past each other , and it was really just a matter of time before it released all that energy . \nThe question was going to be whether it would release it all at once or in a series of smaller earthquakes , '' he told BBC News . \nThe US Geological Survey says the Enriquillo-Plaintain Garden fault has been the likely source of historical large tremors in 1860 , 1770 , 1761 , 1751 , 1684 , 1673 , and 1618 . \nReports suggest that in this latest event , the surface along the fault may have been offset in places by a metre or so . \nHaiti is used to weather-related disasters , of course . \nThe Caribbean nation is often battered by hurricanes . \nHaiti can at least call on the expertise and response systems put in place to deal with those emergencies , although the people who normally co-ordinate that effort will be reeling with the rest of the population . \n"}

\nThis is the center of the city , where all the main administrative and community buildings are clustered . \nMany of them , including the cathedral , the main hospital , and the UN peacekeeping headquarters are reported to have been crushed in the worst earthquake to hit the country in more than 200 years . \nHundreds may have died here , but the death toll is likely to be even higher in the nearby squalid slums such as Cite Soleil , where tens of thousands of the poorest Haitians live in wooden or tin shacks , with no running water , no sewage systems , and no electricity . \nMany of these slum dwellers have been forced to come into Port-au-Prince because , if anything , conditions in the countryside are even harsher . \nSerious malnutrition , Aids , and other chronic diseases are widespread . \nThe city of Gonaives was devastated in 2008 Haiti occupies the mountainous western third of the island of Hispaniola . \nWhen the Europeans first arrived more than 500 years ago , they were amazed at how wooded the country was . \nNow only some 3 % of those original forests remain . \nThe rest have been chopped down for lumber or for charcoal , which is still the most widely used fuel in the countryside . \nIt is this deforestation that increased the havoc caused by a series of storms in 2008 , when almost a thousand people were killed and up to a million were made homeless after four hurricanes struck around the important town of Gonaives in as many weeks . \nIn 2004 , a tropical storm struck the northwest of the country . \nThe historic port of Cap Haitien bore the brunt on that occasion , with an estimated 3,000 people killed . \nIn addition to these natural disasters , Haiti has suffered throughout its history from political turmoil and misrule . \nHaiti got its first democratically elected leader after ` Baby Doc ' was ousted When ` Baby Doc ' Duvalier was forced from power in 1986 , it seemed as though the country might finally enjoy a period of democratic rule . \nAfter several years of unrest , this new hope was symbolised by the election in 1990 of a young former Catholic priest , Jean-Bertrand Aristide . \nBut his period in office came to an end after only a few months , when army colonels seized power . \nThe democratic experience was cut short , several thousand people became victims of the new regime , and thousands more tried to flee the country on home-made rafts . \nIt was the huge influx of these boat people into the United States in 1994 which helped persuade President Bill Clinton that the time had come to kick out the colonels . \nOnce again , Jean-Bertrand Aristide returned to power , and a new , more promising political era seemed about to begin . \nUnder his rule , and that of his successor Rene Preval , and with the help of the United Nations and other international aid organizations , life improved a little , although Haiti remained the poorest country in the Western hemisphere , with average income of less than two dollars a day . \nIt was when Mr Aristide was elected president for a second term in 2001 that the political situation began to slip back into confusion and growing violence . \nRefugees were often picked up off the coast of Miami in the early 1990s . \nPresident Aristide was forced out of power early in 2004 , after several months of increasing political turmoil . \nA UN peacekeeping force of 9,000 has been in Haiti ever since , trying not only to bring stability but also to help build roads and other vital infrastructure projects . \nMr Clinton , now a UN special envoy , has spearheaded attempts to get international donors to live up to their promises of aid . \nUnder Rene Preval , who was elected for a second term in 2006 , there has been a small but significant improvement in conditions in Haiti : jobs have been created , the slums have become less violent , and there have been some timid signs of a growth in tourism . \nNow , as has happened so often in Haiti 's past , the fresh hopes have been extinguished . \nIt will take a massive effort from the United Nations and the international community simply to rescue the thousands of victims and clean up after the earthquake . \nSpeaking after the 2008 disasters , President Preval said that Haiti needed long-term help if it were not to be `` left as always , truly alone , to face new catastrophes '' . \nAcross the Champ de Mars from the presidential palace in Port-au-Prince is - or was - a tall statue to the maroons , the runaway slaves who are the symbol of Haiti 's fight for independence at the end of the 18th century . \nHaitians will need the same spirit now if they are to overcome this latest blow to their nation . \n"}

'' \nMr Rodgers said rescuers were trying to find vehicles to evacuate injured people but the city 's power and infrastructure were all down , leaving it `` very , very dark '' . \nThere have been few reports from outside the capital , but Global Orphan Project posted a video on the YouTube website it said had been filmed in the south of Haiti `` a long way from ground zero '' . \nThe video showed what appeared to be collapsed buildings and people walking around streets strewn with debris . \nHenry Bahn , an official for the US Agriculture Department visiting Haiti , said everybody there was `` just totally freaked out and shaken '' , the Associated Press news agency reported . \nHe said he was walking to his hotel when the ground began to shake . \n`` I could hear a tremendous amount of noise and shouting and screaming in the distance . '' \nMr Bahn described seeing a ravine where several houses had been standing . \n`` It 's just full of collapsed walls and rubble and barbed wire . '' \nPeople are screaming and freaking out down towards the stadium Writing on Twitter , Troy Livesay - a Christian missionary working in Port-au-Prince - described seeing bodies in the street that had been pulled out of collapsed buildings and people standing around in a state of shock . \nThe capital had `` always looked a little rough around the edges , so driving around at night it seems hard to see the damage , then you come upon huge piles of rubble where a supermarket used to be '' , he said . \nSeveral people spoke of hearing people screaming across the city following the quake followed by singing and prayers later on . \nMr Livesay said it was `` a beautiful sound in the middle of a horrible tragedy '' . \nA user of the social networking website Twitter , identifying himself as RAMhaiti , said the singing had become `` louder and more emotional '' before subsiding . \nHe said he could hear no ambulances or helicopters and that aftershocks were still causing panic . \n`` People are screaming and freaking out down towards the stadium , '' he said . \nValerie Moliere , 15 , had to be helped out of her family 's home by her father and said the scene was one of confusion and anguish . \nShe said people were in the streets `` hugging and crying '' and the damage was substantial . \n`` I see broken houses and many people are walking in front of me and they have blood all over them , '' she said . \nThe passengers of a flight from Haiti to Miami , which left shortly after the quake hit , said the airport building had been severely damaged . \n`` The whole outside had deteriorated , from top to bottom it was cracked up totally , '' one man told reporters . \n`` We thought it was something that hit the building , but it turned out it was an earthquake . '' \nOther passengers spoke of their fears for family members left behind in Haiti . \nCarel Pedre , a TV and radio presenter in Port-au-Prince , told the BBC he had witnessed extensive damage on his five-mile walk through the city to reach his daughter . \nThere 's no way that people can get in touch with their family and friends `` I saw a lot of people crying for help , a lot of buildings collapsed , a lot of car damage , a lot of people without help , people bleeding . '' \nHe said he had seen a cinema , a supermarket , a cybercafe and an apartment building , all of which had crumbled in the quake . \nMr Pedre said he could feel aftershocks every 15 to 20 minutes , lasting from three to five seconds each . \nThe darkness , he said , was compounding the fear and worry people were feeling . \n`` There is no electricity , all the phone networks are down , so there 's no way that people can get in touch with their family and friends , '' he said . \nHe said he had not seen any emergency services , adding that while people in the neighborhood were trying to help each other , they did not know `` where to go or where to start '' . \nWithin minutes of the quake , a huge plume of dust and smoke was seen rising from the capital . \nMike Godfrey , a contractor for the US Agency for International Development , told CNN it looked like `` a blanket that completely covered the city and obscured it for about 20 minutes '' . \n"}

'' \n2255 Lord Malloch Brown , the former UN deputy secretary general , tells the BBC that the rescue effort has been damaged by the loss of much of the UN team in Haiti , but that it is well-placed to recover quickly . \n`` Obviously any organization which so tragically has its leadership decapitated is in chaos for a bit . \nBut in fact the UN is much bigger in Port-au-Prince than it is in most places in the world because of the big peacekeeping operation there . \nThe UN is in a better place to regroup and recover than would be the case in many parts of the world where natural disasters strike and the UN has almost no presence . \nBut I think the really big factor here is the proximity to the US , which is able to project by far the most capable logistics operations in crises like this , '' he says . \n2237 US Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano says undocumented Haitians in the United States will be granted `` temporary protected status '' , which will allow those eligible to continue living and working there for the next 18 months . \nThere are an estimated 30,000 Haitians living illegally in the US . \nTPS is granted to foreigners who may not be able to return safely to their country because of a natural disaster , armed conflict or other reasons . \n2228 UK International Development Secretary Douglas Alexander tells the BBC those involved in the aid operation are working against the clock . \n`` We are acutely aware that at this stage in the crisis every hour matters - that 's why we have our British firefighters on the ground already , trying to save lives . \nWe 'll be working round the clock to make sure not just that we save lives , but we tend to the needs of those who have been left devastated by this terrible earthquake .

'' \n1635 Mr Ban says as many as 50 % of the buildings in worst-hit areas either damaged or destroyed . \n`` A high proportion of the 3 million people in the capital area are without access to food , water , shelter and electricity . \nWe are still in the search-and-rescue phase , and we are trying to save as many lives as possible . \nA major humanitarian effort is now well under way . \nAlthough this is inevitably slow and more difficult than any of us would wish . \nWe are mobilising all resources as fast as we possibly can , '' he adds . \n1630 UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon describes the search-and-rescue operation in Haiti as a `` monumental '' task . \nAs for sheltering the homeless survivors , he says the UN needs `` tents and more tents '' . \n1628 Canada 's Foreign Minister , Lawrence Cannon , says some 1,415 Canadians are missing in Haiti . \nFour are confirmed to have died . \nAbout 6,000 Canadian citizens live in Haiti , but Mr Cannon said earlier this week that only 700 were registered with the embassy in Port-au-Prince . \nThe Globe and Mail has information on some of the victims . \n1624 Roger Hilaire has posted pictures of the destruction in Pitchon Ville and Delmas on his Flickr account . \n1616 UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon says it will launch a flash appeal for $ 550m -LRB- # 338m -RRB- later on Friday . \nHe says logistics are `` extremely difficult '' in Haiti , but that the international community 's response to the crisis has been `` generous and robust '' . \n`` We are gearing up rapidly and effectively , despite the challenging circumstances , '' he adds . \nMr Ban plans to visit Haiti `` very soon '' 1612 President Preval asked Mr Obama to pass on a message to the American people : `` From the bottom of my heart and on behalf of the Haitian people , thank you , thank you , thank you , '' he said , according to the White House . \n1611 US President Barack Obama has offered his Haitian counterpart , Rene Preval , his `` full support '' during a telephone conversation . \n1610 US Defense Secretary Robert Gates says the primary goal is to distribute aid as quickly as possible `` so that people do n't , in their desperation , turn to violence '' . \nHe says military planners have been reluctant to drop food and water packages from the air because it could lead to rioting . \nAt present , security is `` pretty good '' , he adds . \n1606 Dozens of US citizens are gathered at Port-au-Prince 's airport , waving their passports in the hope of being evacuated , according to the Associated Press . \n`` I do n't know how much longer we can stand , '' says Beatrice Aristide , waiting with her 19-month-old baby . \nUS citizens had to hold up their passports to gain entry to Port-au-Prince 's airport 1604 Adm Mike Mullen , the chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff , says the US will have up to 10,000 troops in Haiti by Monday . \n1602 Rear Adm Victor Guillery , the man overseeing the US Navy 's operations in Haiti , tells the BBC that the aircraft carrier , USS Carl Vinson , will effectively act as a `` sea base '' outside Port-au-Prince . \n`` Essentially , it allows for the staging of helicopters , supplies and to be responsive to the needs ashore . \nSo , while there is a tremendous amount of effort to complete a port survey and to open a port to allow a greater amount of supplies to come across the pier to the effort , initially much of the work will be done by air , '' he says . \n1553 Medecins Sans Frontieres says thousands of people are waiting in Haiti for surgical treatment . \nSpeaking from Brussels , MSF Operations Director Jerome Oberreit tells the BBC the charity has had to construct makeshift hospital outside the structures that we were using before the earthquake . \n`` This means that the way they can operate is extremely difficult . \nThey do n't have the infrastructure that they would have had ? \nThe priority is to be able to set up surgical facilities that can answer to the acute needs of this population , '' he says . \nExtra medical workers have had to come in overland , because Port-au-Prince 's airport is only accepting cargo planes , he adds . \n1541 The BBC 's Nick Davis , Port-au-Prince says : `` People have been hearing on their portable radios that the international community has pledged a great deal of aid and they can see the planes landing , but they can not get to it . \nThey can not get to the water , which is so vital as the days get hotter . \nSome people have gone three days without food or water . '' \n1537 Andre Berto , a Haitian-American professional boxer who represented Haiti at the 2004 Olympic Games , tells the BBC World Service he is still waiting to hear news about some of his family . \n`` It has been tough . \nEveryone 's in a frenzy trying to find their family . \nI have a charitable foundation in Port-au-Prince and we disperse supplies and food , but the building has been crushed . \nI have the biggest fight of my life coming up , but Haiti is my life . \nWe will continue trying to bring awareness to Haiti and let it be known that we are fighting to get this country where it needs to be , '' he says . \n1534 The BBC 's Imogen Foulkes in Geneva says : `` Tonnes of aid may by heading towards Haiti but little seems to have reached those in need so far . \nAid co-ordinators here say there are now enough large items such as field hospitals and search and rescue teams , but there remains an urgent need for food , clean water , doctors , nurses , medical supplies and body bags . '' \n1531 Only a handful of stories have emerged so far of people being pulled alive from the rubble of buildings . \nRescue workers say that the first 48 hours are crucial for such rescue efforts . \nThe BBC has published an info-graphic showing how they go about their vital work . \n1528 UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown says there has been an `` extraordinary '' response to the disaster from the British public . \n`` We are determined to make sure that the generosity of the British people is matched by the delivery of aid to the people of Haiti , '' he says . \n1525 A spokeswoman for the UN World Food Programme , Emilia Casella , rejects criticism from those watching the suffering in Haiti that the aid operation is too slow . \n`` Pictures can get out instantly , and so everybody can see and hear the pictures , and that 's important because the world needs to know . \nBut getting physically tonnes and tonnes of equipment , and food , and water is not as instant as Twitter or Skype or 24-hour television news , '' she says . \nA security guard warns people queueing for fuel in Port-au-Prince 1521 Former Cuban president Fidel Castro says Haiti 's extreme poverty is `` an embarrassment for our times , in a world in which most people still are victims of exploitation and abuse '' , according to the AFP news agency . \nIn an editorial published by official media , he says it is `` time for real and true solutions for this brother nation '' . \n1517 The Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff , Adm Mike Mullen , says the United States is sending extra troops and marines , a hospital ship , and more helicopters to Haiti in the coming days . \n1514 BBC science and technology reporter Jason Palmer has been looking at how technology and social networking sites have helped news about the earthquake spread around the world , despite the collapse of many communication systems . \n1509 UN spokesman Mark Cutts tells the BBC `` no-one should underestimate the difficulties of operating in a country like Haiti '' . \n`` Even at the best of times , it 's a difficult place to operate . \nIt 's going to be difficult , but we do have a lot of teams which have been mobilised - many of them are in the air , others are already on the ground and we are seeing this operation gear up very quickly . '' \nSolbrook tweets : `` I wish the media would stop calling it looting . \nIt 's people desperate for food and water not hifis and TVs . '' \n1503 US Defense Secretary Robert Gates tells a news conference in Washington that the relief effort in Haiti is the `` highest priority for US military assets in this hemisphere '' . \n1500 Brazilian General Jose Elito Siqueira Carvalho , a former head of UN peacekeepers in Haiti , tells the BBC World Service that co-ordination is vital due to the country 's lack of infrastructure . \n`` If you put materials there without order , this can cause more problems . \nAll 7,000 soldiers are working hard to support the people and it 's tough work . \nThey have to have the motivation to start again . \nThat 's the history of Haiti . \nAnd they are ready to re-start , '' he says . \n1454 Troy Livesay has posted pictures of rubble and make-shift hospitals in Port-au-Prince today on his Flickr account . \nBarbara Jones from Milton Keynes , UK emails : One of my family in the US has spoken to a member of my family in Haiti . \nShe got through by chance on the phone , we had all been trying . \nMy aunt and my cousins are OK - they are living in the street in Port-au-Prince so they wo n't get hurt by falling buildings . \nWe still do n't know about my mother . \n1443 Former US president Bill Clinton , the UN Special Envoy for Haiti , urges Americans to make donations to help provide basic supplies for Haitians affected by the earthquake . \n`` You 've got unprecedented numbers of the people roaming the streets at night with no place to sleep . \nThey have n't had any sleep in two days , they do n't have water , they do n't have food , '' he tells CNN . \n1437 Lt Cmdr Ron Flanders , a spokesman for the US 4th Fleet in Florida , tells the BBC that the USS Carl Vinson has arrived off Haiti and begun ferrying emergency aid ashore . \n`` We have sent two helicopters ashore into Port-au-Prince that were loaded with pallets of food and medical supplies . \nThose helicopters also contained the maritime commanders , '' he says . \nA young French citizen evacuated from Haiti arrives at an airport in Paris 1426 US journalist Andres Oppenheimer , writing in the Miami Herald , says a monitoring commission should formed right away to prevent aid `` being squandered in a country with a history of massive corruption '' . \n`` In a country where the state is so weak that it ca n't run virtually any public services and corruption is rampant , many fear that once the story fades from the headlines , the flow of international aid will diminish , and that much of what gets to Haiti will be stolen , '' he writes . \nA report last year by FRIDE , a Spain-based think tank , stated that `` foreign co-operation has contributed over $ 2.6 bn to Haiti since 1984 , with little to show for it '' , he adds . \n1413 Raymond Joseph , Haiti 's ambassador to the United States , tells the BBC World Service that he is still hearing reports about strong aftershocks in his country . \n`` I am from the south-west peninsular , from the city of Aux Cayes . \nThe aftershock was so strong in Aux Cayes that the only hospital in the city collapsed , '' he says . \nCharles Gomila , London , UK emails : I ca n't believe the most powerful nation in the world can not get aid to the people in Haiti quickly enough . \nNo excuses , just do it ! \n1404 Jan Egeland , the former UN emergency relief co-ordinator , tells the BBC he believes that the situation will improve in the next 24 hours when the US military arrives . \n`` The biggest logistical capacity on Earth is in the hands of the US military . \nThe military will come , and I think today and tomorrow you will see great logistical change - chains being established by them . \nAnd what is good to hear is that the US government and its military will work very closely with the UN , which is also working very closely with the Red Cross . '' \nOn the ground in Haiti with survivors as they desperately plead for help 1400 Ansel Herz , an American journalist in Port-au-Prince , tells the BBC there are children outside the UN compound who have not eaten in `` one , two or three days '' . \n`` I just talked to a young boy whose parents died as their house collapsed . \nHe 's out there searching , waiting for some kind of food and if anybody could give it to him . \nHe has no money , no resources to get any aid of any kind , and that 's just the case for so many children and families that are basically stranded out in Port-au-Prince . \nThere 's not a massive visible relief effort that I can see on the streets , '' he says . \n1352 Jimmy Felter , a film-maker based in the US and founder of the charity , Voice of Haiti , tells the BBC World Service that Haiti 's already poor infrastructure will hamper the rescue effort . \n`` Haiti was hanging on by a string before this - there was starvation before this , '' he says . \n`` There is no infrastructure there , so if you start trying to have an operation where everything starts pouring in it can cause much trouble and confusion . \nIt 's been too little , for too late , for too long . \nBut the spirit of the Haitian people can not be underestimated . \nI 'm not giving an optimistic outlook but I would never give up hope . '' \n1350 The UN World Food Programme earlier said its warehouses in Port-au-Prince had been looted , but this has now been denied . \n`` We do still have that 6,000 tonnes of food , '' WFP spokeswoman Caroline Hurford tells the BBC . \n`` Apparently there were unconfirmed reports of looting taking place , but once our teams got down to the dockside they were able to see that there was some mistake . '' \n1341 Penny Lawrence of the charity , Oxfam , tells the BBC that the breakdown in communications in Haiti is causing many problems on the ground . \n`` All of our systems rely on mobile phones , telephones , sat-phones , email , and the internet . \nAnd we are struggling very , very much without those . \nWe understand people are getting impatient , but I do think there are extraordinary levels of devastation , '' she says . \n1335 The BBC 's Nick Davis in Port-au-Prince says : `` People are doing what they can to survive . \nEvery morning the first jobs of the day involve getting the very basics . \nLoaded with old plastic bottles or anything else that can hold water , they fill up where they can . \nSome from broken pipes from collapsed buildings , that still have a supply . '' \n1327 Olafor Rotsson , a spokesman for the Icelandic Volunteer rescue organization , tells the BBC power shortages and security concerns are slowing the search down at night . \n`` When people get tired , hungry , and thirsty - and maybe lose hope - it gets more difficult . \nUp to now all the locals have welcomed us and we have n't had any problems at all , but the UN says ` security stage three ' , which means you are not allowed to work in the night . '' \n1325 Susan Westwood , at an orphanage in Haiti , blogs : `` We need powdered formula , nappies , baby wipes , baby cereal , infant Tylenol -LRB- paracetamol suspension -RRB- , infant and children 's vitamins , and baby care items such as lotion , powder , baby shampoo . \nWe also hope to be able to assist the surrounding community with clothing , medical supplies , household items , hygiene items such as soap , toothbrushes , toothpaste , blankets and towels . '' \n1323 The Disasters Emergency Committee -LRB- DEC -RRB- in the UK says it has raised # 2m -LRB- $ 3.3 m -RRB- in the first 36 hours since launching its appeal for Haiti - Queen Elizabeth II is among those to have made a donation . \n1313 The New York Times has compiled an informative topographic map of Haiti highlighting the areas affected by the quake . \n1304 Daniel Sergile from Amsterdam e-mails : `` My cousin , Joel , was at work when his building collapsed . \nInitially he was reported to be safe , but it now appears that he is trapped under rubble . \nTwo other cousins have been found safe . \nPhone lines are still down but we are able to communicate via satellite internet . '' \n1257 Oxfam says ensuring access to clean water for survivors is `` probably the most immediate problem to resolve now '' . \n1249 Haiti 's sea , land and air entry points have all suffered damage in the quake - as well as government and aid agency buildings - which is hampering efforts to distribute aid . \nSinging in Haiti 's temporary camps 1231 A US Catholic charity is considering organising a mass airlift of orphaned children from Haiti , the Miami Herald reports . \n1227 Anne Wilkinson , in Ilkley , UK e-mails : `` I worked in Haiti for five years from 2001-2006 . \nThe latest news I have is that St Joseph 's in Petionville has been destroyed but all have been evacuated . \nTwo boys are seriously injured but have not been able to get medical attention .

'' \n1201 World Food Programme spokeswoman Emilia Casella says looting is `` not unusual '' in disaster situations and that aid distribution takes time . \n`` Getting physically tonnes and tonnes of equipments , of food and water is not as instant as Twitter or Skype or 24-hour satellite news , '' AFP quotes her as saying . \n1150 Anjali Kwatra of UK-based charity Action Aid , tells the BBC World Service : `` In the first 48 hours after a disaster , it is n't international aid that makes a difference - that usually comes in after two or three days . \nIt 's the local people who go in , who rescue people , who provide what food , water and shelter that they can . \nWhat we 're seeing in Haiti is that there is n't the ability to do that , because so many people have been affected . '' \n1146 A spokesman for UN peacekeepers in Haiti says people are `` slowly getting more angry and impatient '' with the lack of aid . \n`` We 're all aware that the situation is getting more tense as the poorest people who need so much are waiting for deliveries . \nI think tempers might be frayed , '' David Wimhurst tells the Associated Press . \n1141 The UN says 36 members of its staff in Haiti are confirmed to have died , while nearly 200 are still missing . \n1136 Prospery Raymond , a Christian Aid staff member in Haiti tweets : `` This morning I went to a pharmacy and asked for help and they gave me all their antibiotics , which I took to the hospital .

'' \nThe former British Airways stewardess has worked for the UN for more than 20 years and has been in Haiti for about two years . \nThe UK ambassador to the Dominican Republic and other consular staff have gone to neighbouring Haiti . \nA British search and rescue team - made up of 71 people , mostly from the fire services , and including two search dogs - flew to the region on Thursday . \nForty of them are working alongside Chinese rescuers in the Carrefour district on the edge of the capital , Port-au-Prince . \nThe Department for International Development said they had UN protection . \nAnother group was searching a ruined church in the city center where a child was thought to be trapped . \nThe DEC , an umbrella organization that co-ordinates responses to major disasters overseas , thanked the British public for their contribution to its quake appeal so far . \nDavid Loyn , BBC correspondent , with a rescue team in Haiti Food , water , medical supplies and shelter are needed on a huge scale for several months to come . \nRescue teams from a dozen countries are doing what they can in the capital , which was the epicentre of the earthquake . \nA Spanish team that arrived on Thursday morning had pulled out five people by nightfall including a two-year-old boy . \nAlthough the team did not have any of their heavy equipment , which is still stuck in the gridlock at the airport , they dug with simple tools . \nAnnika Coll , the head of the team , said that `` goosepimples went up on my arm '' when the boy answered when she called out . \nHe was unharmed after 50 hours without food or water . \nThe rescue teams know that there could be many more people like that under the rubble and are frustrated by being unable to get out to work . \nThere are also security concerns . \nSome 9,000 UN military and police personnel have been trying to keep order , and all rescue teams have had armed guards . \nBut it appealed for more financial aid in a BBC One TV appeal presented by Kirsty Young . \nShe said the small Caribbean nation had suffered devastation `` beyond measure '' and added : `` Aid agencies are worried if they do n't deal with problems like sanitation immediately , disease will break out and many more people will die .

'' \nIn response Mr Griffin described UK aid to Haiti as `` stinking elite hypocrisy '' . \nMr Griffin 's original postings , on Facebook and Twitter , said : `` While the Haiti earthquake is terrible , the winter death toll in Britain will be similar . \nNo aid here though . '' \nAbout 45,000-50 ,000 people have died since Tuesday 's 7.0 magnitude earthquake hit Haiti 's capital , Port-au-Prince and 300,000 have been made homeless , according to UN estimates . \nThe Pan American Health Organization has estimated that the death toll could be as high as 100,000 . \nMs Willmott , Labor MEP for the East Midlands , said : `` Yes , people will die here this winter , even though the Labor government set up a welfare state that spends billions to help prevent too many deaths . '' \nShe added : `` Our government and local councils are quite rightly funded to do all they can to help everyone suffering from the cold . \n`` But I am also proud that our government will do all it can to help the people in Haiti and I totally support all the work done by the charities to get supplies out there as soon as possible .

Sending aid to rioting ingrates while our own people die is stinking elite hypocrisy . '' \nAsked about Mr Griffin 's comments , BNP deputy leader Simon Darby criticised the government 's # 6m contribution to the aid effort in Haiti . \nHe said : `` I 'd rather see that # 6m that we spent keeping our own people alive . \nYou look after your own first . \n`` If they 've got surplus money to give away to Haiti - how many people have died because we did n't have the infrastructure to grit the roads ?

'' \n`` Thousands more will have lost all contact with their families and friends and are now struggling to survive alone in the rubble . \n`` They are sleeping on their own , trying to cope with the trauma of seeing dead bodies , and will have no idea where to go for help . \nBev Collin , a paediatric nurse with Mdecins Sans Frontires -LRB- MSF -RRB- , provided care in Indonesia after the tsunami . \nShe says childhood diseases already prevalent in the country will be greatly exacerbated by the devastation left by the earthquake . \n`` There will be a lot of dust around so the air quality will be poor which can aggravate things which are already high risk in children , such as pneumonia . \n`` The other things that are high risk are hepatitis A and E , typhoid fever and diarrhoeal diseases , which are made worse by lack of water . \nThese are kids who are already sick and you want to be able to continue their care Bev Collin , Mdecins Sans Frontires `` And food or water borne diseases will be a major problem because there is probably no drainage and sewage system . '' \nThe initial days after the earthquake will all be about survival , digging people out of the rubble and dealing with crush injuries but there are also ongoing dangers of injury from collapsing and broken buildings , she says . \n`` But in three or four weeks the wet season will be starting and that is really going to cause problems because then you are looking at malaria . \n`` Also Japanese encephalitis is endemic and is a particular problem for children . '' \nShe says aid agencies will be trying to co-ordinate who is responsible for what and getting children to a place of safety is paramount . \nThose who have lost parents will usually be cared for by older siblings , other family members and the wider community , she says . \nBut it is absolutely vital that they can access medical facilities in the coming months . \n`` The thing is these are kids who are already sick and you want to be able to continue their care . '' \nPhysical wounds are of course not the only issue , there will also be psychological scars . \nProfessor Richard Williams , lead officer for disaster management at the Royal College of Psychiatrists , said most people , children and adults , will experience fear , anxiety , guilt , disorientation , hopelessness and other related feelings within the first few days of a disaster . \nBut that is usually temporary and 80 % will not have lasting mental health problems . \nFor a small group there is a longer term risk of depression and anxiety as well as post-traumatic stress disorder . \n`` Children are particularly vulnerable because they depend on adults to care for them . \n`` If they have lost contact with familiar adults there will be the additional burden of grief and bereavement . \n`` It is right to focus on children but the good news is they are just as resilient as adults . '' \nHe says the psychological `` first aid '' that is needed is practical help and that includes food , water and shelter . \n`` After that it is about re-establishing normality and relationships and routine - reconnecting children with their families and getting them back to school . \n`` All these things are incredibly protective of mental health .

'' \nThe WFP initially said its warehouses in Port-au-Prince been looted , but this was later denied . \n`` We do still have that 6,000 tonnes of food , '' spokeswoman Caroline Hurford told the BBC . \n`` Apparently there were unconfirmed reports of looting taking place but once our teams got down to the dockside they were able to see that there was some mistake .

'' \nIn the race to fundraise , social network sites have given aid agencies the power to bypass TV and radio and appeal directly to the public . \nThe Haitian musician Wyclef Jean , for example , has raised $ 1m for earthquake victims through his Yele Haiti foundation , after appealing for help through Twitter . \nWe tweeted ... celebrities re-tweeted ... and after that , the appeal spread like wildfire In the immediate aftermath of the earthquake , he tweeted , asking for donations through his foundation . \nHis 1.3 million followers answered his call - and passed on his appeal with a message : `` Spread the word '' . \nMeanwhile on Facebook , hundreds of thousands of people signed up to awareness groups , such as Earthquake Haiti , which offers a link to Oxfam 's Haiti relief fund . \nOn Youtube , the video sharing site , bloggers began posting their own personal appeals , calling for donations . \nSo , how was this mass mobilisation achieved ? \nAfter all , the American Red Cross had only a modest number of followers on Twitter when their appeal was launched . \nTheir trick was to alert popular celebrities - and let their fans on Twitter do the rest . \n`` Our plan worked exactly like it was supposed to , '' says Wendy Harman , social media manager , at the American Red Cross . \nMy worry was - are people just re-tweeting ? \nOr are they actually donating ? \n`` We have a ` cabinet ' of 30 celebrities , who have agreed to ask their Twitter followers to spread the word . \n`` Within three hours of the earthquake , we had our text number ready . \nAnd then others quickly followed . \nPeople like Michelle Obama , Jane Seymour and Craig Newmark -LRB- of Craigslist -RRB- got on board . \nAnd after that , the appeal spread like wildfire . '' \nTwitter users across the globe began using the RT -LRB- re-tweet -RRB- function to pass the message on to their friends and followers . \nWithin hours , the number for the text appeal : `` 90999 '' was ranked among Twitter 's top 10 `` trending topics '' - which in turn drove more and more people to donate and spread the word . \nWyclef Jean raised $ 1m through his Yele Hait Foundation appeal `` We hit that magical viral sweet spot , '' says Ms Harman . \n`` Everybody out there seems to know that if you text 90999 you donate $ 10 to the Haiti appeal . \n`` My worry was - are people just re-tweeting ? \nOr are they actually donating ? \nIt soon became clear that they really were texting and calling . '' \nUsing an online map tool , hosted by Mgive.com , she and her colleagues were able to watch as donations flooded in from every US state . \nThey did not even have to re-send their appeal . \nThe online community were busy spreading the word for them . \n`` People have been sceptical over the power of the RT -LRB- re-tweet -RRB- and of Twitter generally , '' says Ms Harman . \n`` For example , during the Iran election there was a viral campaign to change your avatar color to green . \n`` But this time , people seemed to be saying : ` Let 's not do anything cute - let 's just donate ' . \n`` I think we have crossed the threshold of novelty with Twitter . \nPeople now want to use it to get something good done . '' \nBut of course , as with any appeal for charity , people 's good will can easily be exploited . \nThe avalanche of tweets , emails and Facebook groups urging web users to donate carries with it an opportunity for internet fraudsters to profit . \nAny money sent using the instructions in this email would end up in the pockets of a cyber criminal Would-be donors have stumbled on some suspicious websites . \nOn Facebook , a group has been founded with a pledge to donate $ 1 for every person who joins . \nThe group has gathered more than 500,000 members . \nBut since it has no administrators , it is not clear who , if anyone , will actually donate the promised money . \nMeanwhile , the security firm Symantec alerted web users to an email scam , soliciting donations for Haiti victims , which purports to come from the British Red Cross -LRB- BRC -RRB- . \n`` The scammers have used the correct postal address , but the BRC does not use Western Union for donations , '' said Con Mallon , a Symantec spokesman . \n`` Also , the email address supplied as a contact is not one belonging to the BRC and any money sent using the instructions in this email would end up in the pockets of a cyber criminal .

'' \nThe BBC 's Matthew Price in Port-au-Prince says Haiti is in massive need of food , water and medicine , as well as bulldozers and heavy lifting equipment . \nBut perhaps more than anything it needs someone to take charge here , our correspondent says . \nThe government is fragile at the best of times and there is no sense it is able to do anything for now . \nThe director of Port-au-Prince 's general hospital said that by 1100 -LRB- 1600 GMT -RRB- at least 1,500 bodies were already stacked inside and outside the mortuary , with police continuing to bring more corpses on pick-up trucks , Reuters reports . \nBan Ki-moon : `` Haiti will need every ounce of help we can offer '' A United Nations spokesman in Haiti , David Wimhurst , said 188 UN staff remained unaccounted for following the collapse of the organization 's HQ in Port-au-Prince and that 36 UN military and police personnel were confirmed dead . \nUN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said it could be days before even an estimate of the overall death toll from the earthquake could be made , but said he feared it would be `` very high '' . \nOn a note of hope , he recounted the survival of an Estonian UN official who was detected under 4m -LRB- 13ft -RRB- of rubble after scratching noises were heard . \nHe was dug out and is now in hospital . \nMr Ban also praised the readiness of the international community to help . \nA British rescue team with heavy lifting gear and dogs has reached Haiti . \nOther plane-loads of rescuers and relief supplies are being sent from China , the EU , Canada , Russia and Latin American nations . \nCuba had more than 300 doctors in Haiti before the earthquake and they have been treating the injured in field hospitals . \nUS Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , who canceled a trip to Asia to deal with the crisis , said Haiti 's recovery was `` going to be a long-term effort '' . \nThe World Bank is funding $ 100m of emergency aid . \nThe World Food Programme is working on supplying 15,000 tonnes of food and the Red Cross has begun a $ 10m appeal . \n"}

'' \nIronically , people living in the shanty towns might have had a better chance of survival than those trapped under concrete buildings , many of which `` pancaked '' . \n`` A simple shack 's collapse is likely to cause less damage to human safety than a multi-floor building that collapses , '' Mr McAslan said . \nMr McAslan says it is more complex and expensive to earthquake-proof a building than equip it for hurricane damage . \n`` The priorities have inevitably been elsewhere , but I 'm absolutely certain that the attention of the government will be to build back better . '' \nHe said the main task for the authorities now was to save as many lives as possible , then to stabilise damaged buildings so they could withstand any aftershocks , and finally , to assess how to create buildings that could reasonably withstand another earthquake . \nAccording to Mr McAslan , the extent of deforestation in Haiti also contributed to devastation . \nHe said that on the hillsides of Petionville , a suburb east of Port-au-Prince , buildings simply `` collapsed and collapsed and collapsed '' on to each other as there was no forest to protect them . \nAccording to the US Geological Survey , the loss of life from earthquakes is typically 10 times higher in developing countries than the West and the damage can be up to 100 times worse . \n"}

'' \nI have heard nothing from my friends in Haiti since the earthquake Unfortunately the familiar sight around disaster zones of Anglesey 's International Dog Rescue service have n't been able to join the mission . \nThe veterans of the 1999 Turkey earthquake and the 2004 boxing day tsunami in south east Asia have been thwarted , not by the conditions on the ground , but by the adverse weather back here in Britain . \n`` The irony is bitter to say the very least , '' said Russell Vaughan of International Dog Rescue . \n`` With all the disruption in Port-au-Prince , it 's the British weather which has hamstrung us . \n`` As soon as news came through on Tuesday night , we were booked on a British Airways flight to Jamaica on Wednesday , in time to meet a Royal Navy ship carrying aid to Haiti . \nFirefighters from around the UK have flown out to the quake zone `` Unfortunately the snow meant that all flights from Gatwick were grounded yesterday , and the next service which could have accommodated all the dogs is n't until this evening . \n`` Sadly that would have meant that we 'd have arrived in Port-au-Prince on Saturday , which realistically is getting towards the end of the viable window for survival in the very hot conditions in Haiti . \n`` By Saturday we 'd have been of limited use , and we 'd have simply been taking up time , space and resources needed by other aid workers , and holding up the transition from a search and rescue mission to a humanitarian and clean-up one . '' \nGareth Owen from Dolanog near Welshpool , Powys , who is director of emergencies at Save the Children , is heading up the operation to protect the estimated two million children caught up in the disaster . \nAs the quake hit during school time on Tuesday , many more children than usual have become separated from their parents and are having to fend for themselves on the ruined streets . \nOver three million were displaced in the quake `` As well as getting basic supplies in , it 's crucial that children struggling on their own are protected from being crushed by more debris and are kept safe from abuse on the streets . \nThis is not a safe place for children , '' Mr Owen said . \n`` They are sleeping on their own , trying to cope with the trauma of seeing dead bodies , and will have no idea where to go for help . \n`` Children mimic adults in these sorts of crises . \nThey see grown-ups scrabbling through the debris looking for bodies , and will try to follow suit . \n`` Aside from the damage this is doing to their mental health , it 's putting their safety in danger as buildings will be very unstable and may still collapse . '' \nHe added that rescuers are still searching for 20 members of the Save the Children team who have n't been seen since the quake on Tuesday . \nWelsh artist Cherry Pickles spent most of last year in Haiti , from where she drew inspiration for her collection currently on display at the Dylan Thomas center in Swansea . \nAfter hearing about the crisis , she 's decided to offer all proceeds from the exhibition , valued at around # 20,000 , to help the victims . \n`` I have heard nothing from my friends in Haiti since the earthquake , '' she said . \n`` When I confided to my mum that the idea of me talking about Haiti in the current situation makes me feel very uneasy , she suggested that I try to arrange a sale or auction of the work , all of the proceeds of which would go specifically to help Haiti . \n`` That is what I am going to do . \nI would want this money to go to support education in Haiti as that is the area my Haitian friends think will make the most significant long term difference there .

watching their friends die in front of their eyes . \nOthers have made it back . \nThe whole town is going through mourning . \nEvery couple of hours we hear of someone who has n't survived . \nEven though we are 150km far from Port-au-Prince , in a country like Haiti we depend on the main supplies lines from there . \nThat line has now been cut and I think we can expect to see food , fuel and basic supplies dwindle over the coming days . \nBARBARA JONES , MILTON KEYNES , UK Update from Barbara , a Haitian who has been in the UK for eight months One of my relatives in the US managed to speak to a member of our family in Haiti . \nShe got through by chance on the phone , we had all been trying since the earthquake happened . \nShe said my aunt and my cousins are OK . \nThey are now living in the street in Port-au-Prince so they wo n't get hurt by falling buildings , but at least they 're OK . \nWe still do n't know about my mother . \nShe lives outside the capital , in Gonaives which was badly affected by hurricanes in 2008 . \nIt 's even hard to get hold of her at the best of times . \nMy wife , Mimi , is stuck under the rubble of a supermarket in the Delmas area of Port-au-Prince . \nOn Wednesday we heard that Mimi had managed to use a blackberry phone to text her cousin in Haiti . \nI have n't been able to talk to her to confirm this . \nI 've also heard that someone managed to speak to Mimi on Thursday , at the time she was stuck with another 25 people . \nBut I just I do n't know whether this is true . \nWhat I do know is that her car is still parked at the supermarket . \nFrom talking to rescue teams , I 'm hearing that there are possibly 50 people in the rubble there . \nIt 's difficult to get to them because of the lack of heavy equipment - the ceiling of the supermarket is just too hard to break through , and there are n't enough rescue dogs in the area either so the rescue teams do n't know exactly where to dig . \nI 'm hearing many conflicting reports from Haiti and we 're powerless to do anything . \nPeople have been sleeping in the street . \nI live in the Dominican Republic but came here soon after the earthquake to look for my relatives . \nI am in Petionville . \nIt is probably one of the least affected areas of the city . \nI have been driving in the streets all day , trying to find friends , relatives , looking for food , water , fuel , taking pictures . \nThe streets of Port-au-Prince are filled with dead bodies covered in sheets . \nIt looks like the entire city structure is collapsed . \nThere is still no phone communication , no electricity , no public transportation . \nPeople stay and sleep right in the streets . \nSome have no houses to go back to , some are afraid of another quake . \nThere is no kind of rescue from the public services nor the humanitarian aid . \nPeople are trapped under the rubble and slowly dying . \nHe said he had managed to pull out his three daughters , but not his son The air is starting to smell like dead bodies . \nPeople are wearing masks as they walk the street . \nThe population is extraordinarily calm and quiet . \nStill stunned by the magnitude of the blow . \nA lot of people are going up and down the street . \nI imagine they are looking for resources , looking for their relatives . \nAt around 10pm last night , a neighbor of a relative we went looking for asked us if we could help him get his 13-year-old son from under the rubble . \nHe said he had managed to pull out his three daughters , but not his son . \nHe pointed to a spot under the rubble and asked me if I could see the boy 's hand . \nThere were three little fingers in the middle of the concrete and the metal . \nI said I could n't help . \nHe asked if I could broadcast the news that his son was dead on the radio , so that the boy 's mother could know , as she he was not at Port-au-Prince at the time I live in Haiti but was on a business trip to the United States . \nI am trying to go back to Port-au-Prince to reunite with my parents . \nI am flying to the Dominican Republic and will then go to Haiti by taxi . \nIt will take me from eight to nine hours . \nMy parents live very near to the Caribbean Supermarket which fell down in Petionville . \nI managed to talk to them after hundreds of attempts over the phone . \nThey told me there is no water or food . \nThey took around 200 neighbors into the house and they are sleeping by the swimming pool . \nThey can take water from it and boil it and use tablets , but there is almost no food . \nMy mother says she can still hear people crying for help . \nWe are bringing 200 pounds of dried food with us , but that can not possibly feed 200 people . \n"}

{"id": "348", "time": "2010-01-15", "text": "Inmarsat 's chief executive Andrew Sukawaty explains to the BBC 's Daniel Emery how his firm 's satellite network is assisting in Haiti 's rescue efforts The collapse of traditional channels of communication in Haiti has again highlighted the role of social media and the internet in disasters . \nTwitter is being used as a prime channel for communications , while sites such as Ushahidi are providing maps detailing aid and damage . \nBoth Google and Facebook are producing missing persons lists . \nSatellite networks are also diverting resources to provide communications to aid agencies and the military . \nThe very first images to escape from the region after Tuesday 's earthquake came from citizens , capturing video with mobile phones . \nBut landlines near the epicentre have been wiped out , and mobile phone service has been at best intermittent - a fact that has already hampered rescue efforts . \nThe UN body Telecoms Sans Frontieres , which maintains a network of telecommunications engineers and mobile equipment worldwide , has deployed two teams in the region . \nThe World Food Programme operates a similar service . \n`` When we arrive in the country , we establish a telecoms center for the humanitarian community , for them to be able to communicate and have access to internet and phone , '' said Telecoms Sans Frontiere 's Catherine Sang . \nI am starting to run - literally , run - every time an aftershock hits . \nSeen far too many bodies . \nDo n't wanna add to that number `` We also operate a humanitarian calling operation for the population , so they can call their family and friends in the country or abroad , '' she told BBC News . \nMs Sang said that the teams have as yet been unable to set up the network for the general populace due to security concerns . \nInmarsat , a UK-based firm that operates a network of satellites , received word from the UN just an hour after the initial quake , and has begun re-allocating satellite time to the region . \nFor those with satellite-enabled equipment - namely aid agencies and the military - such extra capacity is vital when traditional communication channels have been damaged or cut off altogether . \nHowever , for the ordinary people in the worst-affected areas of Haiti , as well as loved ones desperate for information about them , the most relevant sources of information are civilians on the ground with some familiar technological tools at their disposal . \nJust seconds after the earthquake , people began to send messages from Haiti through Twitter . \nSince then , the Twitter group tagged '' #relativesinhaiti '' has been flooded with traffic from relatives trying to find out about their loved ones from abroad , while '' #rescumehaiti '' is being used to direct rescue efforts where trapped survivors have been located . \nThe Red Cross , CNN and the New York Times are compiling missing persons databases , but the Facebook group `` Earthquake Haiti '' has more than 160,000 members . \nTweets are directing search and rescue efforts complete with addresses Pierre Cote is a journalist based in Haiti who has been contacted by a number of news organizations in the wake of the disaster , and who is broadcasting from a studio over the web . \nHe conducted an interview with the BBC via the service Skype , popular for making voice and video calls over the internet , and spoke about his role in communicating about the disaster . \n`` If I 'm not doing it , no one will do it - the traditional media wo n't do it , '' he said . \n`` The community need it so for me it 's a service to the community to bring it all together . '' \nAnother web-based tool that has recently become crucial in disaster relief and information dissemination is Ushahidi . \nInitially the service made its name following the disputed Kenyan elections of 2007 . \nIt provides an open-source , free service which can overlay maps of affected regions with data gathered from a raft of sources . \nDetailed maps can show , for instance , where aid will be delivered , where running water has been cut off or restored , or - as in the case of Haiti - where aftershocks have been reported . \nHowever , recent experience with the unpoliced nature of these vast streams of data has made clear that not all information can be trusted . \nAmong the pictures circulating around the internet in the wake of the Haiti disaster , one claiming to be of a Haitian bridge was actually taken in Japan following an earthquake in 2006 . \nThe risks of such misinformation in the aftermath of a disaster - in particular for those cases that involve divisive politics or propaganda - have already been identified in a report compiled by the UN Foundation\\/Vodafone Foundation technology partnership in December . \nThe open-source Ushahidi is again proving a valuable information tool The founders of Ushahidi are working on a verification system that can independently assure that information coming in is corroborated and accurate . \nTaken together , the flow of information via these tools , alongside compiled by services that make sense of it , means that dealing with the aftermath of disaster is quicker , more integrated , and more visible to those inside and outside the affected area . \nHowever , no such efforts can fully replace a functioning , full-scale infrastructure , and that will leave many people both inside and outside Haiti anxious for answers . \nThere are initial reports that some of the local phone networks have managed to restore some capacity . \nKen Banks , founder of FrontlineSMS and a specialist in mobile telecoms in emergency situations , said that once people realize the networks are back up they are likely to become very congested . \n`` It will be like New Year 's Eve as everyone tries to get through , '' he told BBC News . \n`` SMS is more likely to get through , even if it is delayed .

'' \nEleven members of the family were in the house at the time of the earthquake . \nBut they all survived . \nAnd the house is intact . \nEven though everything was in tatters around them . \nAll I can say to people is do n't give up hope just yet because among the darkness sometimes there is a small glimmer of light . \nI hope more families will have good fortune like we have . \nEarthquake damage in Haiti . \nPicture : Eric Lotz , Operation Blessing My partner and I are US citizens who have been helping in the triage areas of the main UN base near the Toussaint L'Ouverture airport since the night of the quake . \nWe are civilians and are still waiting to hear word back from officials in the US Embassy about evacuations . \nUntil then , we 're here comforting families and children and doing whatever we can to help the incoming victims . \nThe UN is supposed to begin building a new mobile hospital today . \nAround 2,000 US marines are supposed to land as well . \nThe UN has already sent out wounded foreign nationals to hospitals in Miami , along with very badly wounded Haitians . \nTwo Haitian girls are waiting for foot amputations sometime today . \nOur passports , computers , clothes and medicine are all buried in the house we were staying at in Port-au-Prince . \nAll that we have with us now are the clothes on our backs . \nWe were talking with friends in an adjacent neighborhood when the quake hit . \nWe immediately walked back to our friends ' house to find that that everyone was mercifully OK . \nAfterwards , we began rounding up all the wounded from the surrounding neighborhoods and put them all in one area . \nWe gathered together more than 200 wounded and the message kept spreading . \nTremors still shake everyone in the compound and make it especially difficult to get any sleep at night . \nThese past two days have been a nightmare , especially for the countless Haitians who have lost everything . \nBARBARA JONES , MILTON KEYNES , UK I am Haitian and have lived in the UK for just eight months . \nI was working and living in the Dominican Republic before then and if I was there now , I would have run across the border to find out what has happened to my family . \nTo see how the whole world is responding is amazing I have not heard from my mother or my cousins . \nMy aunt is also missing . \nShe gave me my education and I owe her so much , she was a huge part of my childhood . \nMy family live in Port-au-Prince , right at the epicentre of the earthquake . \nI have n't heard from any of them . \nI have been calling all my other relatives and friends in Haiti . \nThe phone lines are down a lot of the time and I ca n't get through . \nI am relying on family in America as well . \nI am recently married and my husband has been wonderful . \nHe has been supporting me otherwise I would be feeling very alone . \nHaitians , we are used to disaster but this is the worse thing that has ever happened . \nIt is so upsetting . \nHaiti 's government can not respond to something on this scale . \nTo see how the whole world is responding is amazing . \nI am close to tears when I see how everyone is coming to help us . \nSebastien Barrau and Marvin Chery I am from Haiti and I moved to Miami four years ago . \nMy family is still there . \nI got a call from my sister asking me to call her back straight away , she mentioned something about an earthquake . \nI did n't think it was that bad . \nWhen I got off the phone to her , I checked Twitter and I could see everybody posting information on there . \nI started to get really worried for friends and family but it was my first day at a new job so I felt I could n't just get up and leave . \nIt was so terrible seeing the images on the television and online . \nPlaces I know and have visited were just destroyed . \nHaiti has had a lot of problems but nothing like this . \nIt 's so shocking to see how everything has been destroyed and I just want to go back and help . \nI ca n't though and so I decided to create a website to help . \nI had a lot of people on Twitter contacting me , asking for information about loved ones . \nI thought it would make sense to get a website together where people can put up pictures and appeal for information about missing people . \nEverybody is worried and the list makes it easier . \nMy school friend from Haiti , Marvin Chery , and I put the website together and it 's now live . \nI 'm really disappointed . \nThere are so few survivors . \nI spoke to a friend who helped get five people out of a collapsed supermarket , just five people . \nI 've heard about people being alive one day and stuck under the rubble but who do n't make it . \n"}

'' \nHe said it took two hours to make enough of an entry point to grab her feet and slowly pull her out of a very small opening . \n`` We got her on the stretcher , she had a couple of cuts and bruises and off she went to hospital . \nIt was another good result , '' he said . \nThe rescuers ' departure came as the Disasters Emergency Committee revealed that UK donations to its appeal for Haiti had so far reached more than # 42m . \nA charity single cover of REM 's Everybody Hurts featuring artists including Leona Lewis , Rod Stewart and the band JLS is also being released to raise money for the appeal . \nRelief workers are heading to the capital with water , food , drugs , telephones and clothing . \nSome supplies of aid from the UK have already been flown out to the country . \nOne Briton is confirmed dead in the disaster , with another still missing . \nUN worker Frederick Wooldridge , 41 , from Kent , was the first Briton named among the dead , along with dozens of his colleagues . \nAnother Briton , UN worker Ann Barnes , 59 and originally from Leigh-on-Sea , Essex , remains missing . \n"}

'' \nShe said an IRC team rescued three boys who had been buried in the ruins of their school for five days after the earthquake in Pakistan in 2005 . \n`` They were laid flat on backs next to each other , with the ceiling touching their noses but totally unhurt , '' she said . \nAnother boy alongside them had died . \nAfter so long in the dark , rescue teams had to cover the boys ' eyes as they pulled them out , to protect them from the strong sunlight . \nDr Tejsrhi Shah of Medecins Sans Frontieres says many of those injured in earthquakes are so badly hurt they would not reach medical care . \nBut she says that if people are trapped , `` just the immobility will reduce your chance of survival '' . \nBeing unable to move or having injuries to limbs can lead to crush syndrome , she says , where blood flow to the limbs is disrupted . \nWhen the crush is removed , a build-up of toxins floods the body and it is unable to cope . \nMazandarani spent nine days in the rubble of her home `` It causes renal damage and shock , people are in agony with the pain and have a high risk of developing renal failure if do n't get urgent medical care , '' she said . \nDr Shah says there are reports of people surviving in rubble even longer than two weeks , but such cases are `` incredibly rare '' . \n`` The chances of getting someone out alive decreases with each day , '' she says . \nBeing trapped in a confined space also means a rising temperature and an increase in carbon dioxide , which , if it reaches too high a level , leads to suffocation . \nSearch teams monitor for rising levels of CO2 in a building - a rise means someone is trapped inside and breathing . \nWhen CO2 levels stop rising , the search is no longer needed . \nGraham Payne , chairman and founder of rescue charity Rapid , told the BBC trapped people could go quiet for hours at a time if they passed out or fell asleep but teams never gave up on them . \n`` You think you 've lost them but you carry on . \nIt might be another eight hours , then they start making noise again . \n`` But if they 're trapped and we can hear , then we get them out , we do n't give up . '' \nIf you are uninjured , have an air supply and are in an adequate space - however small - the next priority is water . \nDr Shah says estimating how long people can survive without water is the `` million dollar question '' , but that the average is between three and seven days . \n`` It depends on the ambient temperature , how much fluid you 're losing through sweat , if you have diarrhoea , how healthy you are , how old you are , '' she says . \nA few fortunate people may find themselves trapped with a clean supply but others will find a trickle of rainwater , condensation or even use water from inside radiators . \nFollowing the South Korean supermarket collapse , IRC rescued a man who had been trapped for 13 days - he had been drinking drops of rainwater and eating cardboard lying around him to stave off hunger . \nSome of those rescued in Haiti have spoken of being encouraged by hearing voices around them . \nBut Ms Ryan says that as time goes on , knowing other people are trapped can be more upsetting than comforting . \n`` The man trapped in Korea was initially lying with quite a few people but one by one they all stopped talking . \nSo psychologically , it does n't do any good . '' \nShe says the best thing buried survivors can do is stay calm and listen , however hard that may be . \n`` We use sound location equipment to look for survivors , which picks up tapping . \nIf you hear tapping , tap back , or shout , '' she says . \nBut despite the best preparation and advice , rescuers say survival often comes down to `` sheer determination '' . \n`` It 's the will , '' says Mr Payne . \n`` Some people just accept they are trapped and it 's fate . \nOthers just keep going .

'' \nWhile it was a complicated operation getting the aid organised and on a flight from Stansted to the Dominican Republic via Denmark , where it also picked up supplies , the hard part will be to ensure the aid gets to the people who need it most when it arrives in Haiti , where it was due to arrive on Sunday . \nThis is another area where the overall relief effort in Haiti has been criticised - with claims of poor distribution and confusion - with some areas even getting too much supplies and others too little . \nBut aid agencies point to the scale of the disaster in a country that was already lacking in infrastructure , and say the picture is slowly improving . \n`` People have to understand that we can not send goods if we are not able to receive it in Port-au-Prince , '' says Florent Mayolle . \n`` So we need first to prepare the goods in a good manner , and to send it with security and to be able to receive the goods and afterwards to distribute it properly . \n`` Until now we had some problem of security , we did n't have the warehouse for storage . \nWe will not be able to send it to lie on the ground without security - it is not possible . '' \nThe Disasters Emergency Committee is co-ordinating an appeal to help the people of Haiti There are 13 charities involved including the British Red Cross , Islamic Relief and World Vision Donate via the DEC website or by calling 0370 60 60 900 With the warehouse and transport arranged - the small convoy of trucks carrying British aid was able to set off on Saturday afternoon . \nBecause convoys are only crossing the border twice a day due to security considerations , the drivers were waiting there overnight before completing their journey . \nThe aid included a wide range of material , from tools that will be useful in improving sanitation to latrine slabs and water tanks . \nOxfam says it is working in seven sites across the Haitian capital - trying to provide help to more than 90,000 people . \nFor all the main agencies the process of getting supplies to Haiti has been fraught with difficulties , and in the weeks and months to come lessons may well have to be learned from the experience of the last few days . \nBut among aid workers on the ground there also seems to be an endless amount of goodwill and determination - backed by the generosity of people in countries around the world . \n"}

'' \nHe added that Wismond Exantus was expected to be out of hospital `` in a day or two '' . \nGreek , French and US rescue teams were involved in the two-and-a-half-hour operation to bring him out of the remains of the hotel . \nA French rescue worker , Lt Col Christophe Renou , described his survival as `` a miracle '' . \nHe said rescuers - who had been alerted by the man 's family - had managed to get water to him while they worked to dig him out . \nLt Col Renou said the man had probably been helped by the fact that the 5-6m -LRB- 16-20ft -RRB- of debris above him was largely wood , rather than concrete . \nHe said the man had told his rescuers that another four people were trapped with him but that they had stopped moving a couple of days earlier . \nThe BBC 's Adam Mynott , in Port-au-Prince , says some Haitians have questioned the announcement that search-and-rescue operations are to end - and the discovery of Wismond Exantus will have lent weight to their argument . \nSpeaking before Mr Enso 's rescue , UN spokeswoman Elizabeth Byrs in Geneva said the decision to end the search for survivors was `` heartbreaking '' but that it had been taken on the advice of experts . \nEmmannuel Buso , 21 - rescued after 10 days Marie Carida , 84 - saved after 10 days Mendji Bahina Sanon , 11 - trapped for eight days Lozama Hotteline , 25 - pulled out after seven days Elisabeth Joassaint , 15 days - buried for seven days , half her life Ena Zizi , 69 - rescued after seven days She said most search-and-rescue teams would now be leaving Haiti , although some with heavy lifting equipment might stay to help with the clean-up operation and with aid distribution . \nTwo people , an 84-year-old woman and a 21-year-old man , were pulled alive from the rubble in Port-au-Prince on Friday . \nThe woman , who was found in the wreckage of her home seriously injured and severely dehydrated , was taken to the main city hospital for treatment . \nThe 21-year-old man , Emmannuel Buso , was rescued by an Israeli search team and is said to be in a stable condition . \nSpeaking from his hospital bed , he described how he had had no food , and had drunk his own urine to keep thirst at bay . \nAn estimated 1.5 million people were left homeless by the 7.0-magnitude quake , which some have estimated has killed as many as 200,000 people . \nAt least 75,000 bodies have so far been buried in mass graves , Haiti 's government has said . \nMany more remain uncollected in the streets . \nThe UN says 130,000 people have now been relocated out of Port-au-Prince , easing the pressure on overcrowded camps in the city . \nOrganisers of the `` Hope for Haiti Now '' telethon , led by George Clooney and Haiti-born rapper Wyclef Jean , said it raised more than $ 57m -LRB- # 35m -RRB- for the aid effort . \nBroadcasting on the radio daily at 0910 local time -LRB- 1410 GMT -RRB- Twenty-minute program in Haitian Creole Broadcasting on FM in Haiti 's six largest cities Also available on satellite and online , and via social media Friday night 's event , which was shown on all major US TV channels , YouTube and on MTV in the UK , set a new record for disaster relief telethons , said Lisa Paulsen , head of the Entertainment Industry Foundation . \nThe BBC has started a new radio service in Creole , one of the country 's main languages . \nThe 20-minute long daily broadcast , called Connexion Haiti , will try to give people up-to-date information about the basic services they need to survive - such as where to find food , clean drinking water , medical assistance and shelter . \n"}

with a magnitude of 7.0 - struck at 1653 local time -LRB- 2153 GMT -RRB- on Tuesday , 12 January . \nInternational search teams continued their work to find survivors , despite the Haitian government calling an official end to the rescue phase , and were rewarded by pulling Wismond Exantus from the remains of the Napoli Inn Hotel 11 days after the quake . \nGreek , French and US rescue teams were involved in the two-and-a-half-hour operation to bring him out . \nMeanwhile , organisers of the Hope for Haiti telethon in the US said it had raised more than $ 57m -LRB- # 35m -RRB- for victims . \nThey said Friday night 's event had set a new record for disaster relief telethons . \nTwo people were rescued after spending 10 days under the rubble . \nAn 84-year-old woman and 21-year-old man were pulled out alive in Port-au-Prince , but with no further signs of life reported the Haitian government declared the rescue effort over at 1600 local time -LRB- 2100 GMT -RRB- . \nLater a massive benefit concert was broadcast to try to raise money for victims . \nThe two-hour Hope for Haiti telethon featured more than 100 Hollywood and music stars . \nThe concert , which took place in New York , Los Angeles , London and Haiti , included Bono , Bruce Springsteen , Sting , Rihanna , Brad Pitt , Clint Eastwood , Julia Roberts and Leonardo DiCaprio . \nAbout 400,000 survivors will be moved to tented villages outside the capital , Port-au-Prince , with 100,000 people initially being sent to 10 settlements near the suburb of Croix Des Bouquets , Interior Minister Paul Antoine Bien-Aime announced . \nThe International Organisation for Migration , distributing tents and plastic sheeting , warned that more permanent shelter would soon be needed by the 500,000 people living outdoors . \nIn a bid to deliver greater quantities of aid , the US military was operating at four airports in the region - Port-au-Prince and Jacmel in Haiti , and San Isidro and Barahona in the neighbouring Dominican Republic . \nThe US Coast Guard partially reopened the capital 's main sea port which was damaged in the quake . \nFour vessels had docked by Thursday evening . \nA strong aftershock rocked Haiti , sending screaming people running into the streets . \nSome buildings already weakened by last week 's quake collapsed . \nThe magnitude 6.1 tremor struck west of Port-au-Prince at 0603 local time -LRB- 1103 GMT -RRB- . \nThe aftershock hit as people were still being found alive in the rubble from the original quake . \nThey included a five-year-old boy reportedly pulled from the ruins of his home by his uncle . \nEarlier a 10-year-old girl and her eight-year-old brother were found . \nMore than 120 people altogether have been rescued by international teams . \nThe US announced it was sending another 4,000 sailors and marines to Haiti for the earthquake relief effort , diverting them from deployments in the Gulf and Africa . \nMany victims unable to find treatment in Haiti , have crossed the border into the Dominican Republic . \nBut the BBC 's Gary Duffy says the volume of patients is so great the hospitals there are struggling to cope . \nHaitian officials said the death toll from the quake was likely to be between 100,000 and 200,000 , and that 75,000 bodies had already been buried in mass graves . \nAn estimated 1.5 million are homeless . \nThe US presence in the country increased as Black Hawk helicopters dropped scores of troops into the grounds of the ruined presidential palace . \nCaptain Steve McInerney : `` They do rush the aircraft which can be expected '' The UN Security Council also voted unanimously to send a further 3,500 UN troops and police to Haiti , to maintain law and order . \nOfficials said the general security situation was stable , but the BBC 's Nick Davis in Port-au-Prince said there were concerns that looting and violence were a growing threat . \nMeanwhile , doctors said they were having to carry out hundreds of amputations , with only basic medical equipment , because of the large numbers of people suffering gangrene or traumatic injuries . \nSearch and rescue teams received a boost when an apparently unharmed elderly woman , Ena Zizi , was pulled from the rubble of the capital 's Catholic cathedral , one of 90 people found alive in Haiti 's ruins so far . \nThe BBC 's Christian Fraser said that while some markets on the road to Port-au-Prince were still open , their supplies were running low and becoming increasingly expensive . \nThe leading US general in Haiti Lt Gen Ken Keen said it was a `` reasonable assumption '' that up to 200,000 people might have died in last Tuesday 's earthquake . \nUN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said he would recommend that the Security Council boost UN troop numbers in Haiti by 2,000 for six months , and UN police numbers by 1,500 . \nBill Clinton : `` There 's no question it 's not enough , not quick enough '' Meanwhile , almost a week after the earthquake violence and looting have broken out in parts of Port-au-Prince . \nPolice fired shots to disperse looters in parts of the capital . \nUN police fired baton rounds to force a crowd back from the gates of the airport . \nThe former American President Bill Clinton , who is in Haiti as a special UN representative , said that given the circumstances , it was understandable that there had been some disorder . \nThousands of people were fleeing the capital , Port-au-Prince , with many leaving for the countryside in the hope of finding food and water . \nThe BBC 's Mark Doyle came across what is left of a poor community in the hills above the capital , to find a group of people - their homes destroyed - trying to heat up some food scraps in a pan of thin soup , their only meal of the day . \nFirst reports from the epicentre of Tuesday 's earthquake suggested the damage was even more dramatic than in the capital . \nBBC correspondents said the scene in Leogane was `` apocalyptic '' , with thousands left homeless and almost every building destroyed . \nThe UN said up to 80-90 % of buildings in Leogane , about 19km -LRB- 12 miles -RRB- west of Port-au-Prince , had been destroyed . \nThe extent of the damage in Haiti 's villages In the capital , survivors were becoming desperate as they waited for aid being handed out by international agencies . \nBut in a sign of hope , rescuers pulled a woman alive from the rubble . \n`` It 's a little miracle , '' the woman 's husband , Reinhard Riedl , told the Associated Press news agency after she was rescued from a luxury hotel . \nThe Pan American Health Organization put the death toll at 50,000-100 ,000 , while Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive said 100,000 `` would seem a minimum '' . \nUS Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , the first senior overseas politician to arrive in Haiti , said the US would be `` here today , tomorrow and for the time ahead '' , asserting that `` Haiti can come back even better and stronger in the future '' . \nDesperation among survivors of the earthquake led to rising fears over security in Port-au-Prince . \nThere were some reports of gangs preying on residents and looting , and officials said thousands of prisoners were unaccounted for after the main prison was destroyed . \nDamage to the seaport , roads and other infrastructure still prevented the speedy distribution of food , water and medical supplies . \nRelief was arriving , but little had moved beyond the jammed airport . \nA spokeswoman for the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs said aid workers were dealing with a disaster `` like no other '' in UN memory because the country had been `` decapitated '' . \nInterior Minister Paul Antoine Bien-Aime said 50,000 bodies had been collected , but the total number of dead could be `` between 100,000 and 200,000 '' . \nThe UN launched an appeal for $ 562m -LRB- # 346m -RRB- intended to help three million people for six months . \nMany spent another day without food and shelter in the ruined capital . \nThe BBC 's Andy Gallacher in Port-au-Prince said survivors were dying in huge numbers , and clean water , food and medical supplies were desperately needed . \nShaul Schwarz , a photographer for Time magazine , told the BBC he had seen a roadblock formed with bodies of quake victims on a main road , south of the capital . \nHe said he believed this was an `` act of anger '' on the part of people who were not getting help . \nBottlenecks and infrastructure damage were said to be holding up aid efforts - with estimates of the number of dead put at as many as 45,000-50 ,000 . \nDramatic stories of survival began to emerge . \nUK firefighters pulled two-year-old Haitian girl Mia from the rubble where she had been trapped for three days when her kindergarten totally collapsed . \nUN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon told of one UN staff member found alive beneath the rubble of the international body 's collapsed headquarters in Port-au-Prince . \nEstonian protection officer Tarmo Joveer , Mr Ban said , was only found after `` scratching sounds '' were heard and was kept alive by being `` given water through a rubber pipe '' . \nThousands spent a second night in the open after the earthquake , as the search for survivors under the rubble went on after darkness . \nThe first US aid planes landed at the airport serving the capital and US naval ships were on the way . \nEU states , Russia and China were among those sending rescue and medical teams by plane while pledges of aid were made by countries around Latin America . \nThe BBC 's Andy Gallacher in Port-au-Prince said the situation in the capital was increasingly desperate with no sense of a co-ordinated rescue effort , scant medical supplies and aid only trickling in . \nEfforts to rescue survivors trapped in rubble were hampered by the lack of heavy-lifting equipment and much of the work was being done by individuals with simple tools or their hands . \nOfficials at the UN said between 100 and 150 people from its 9,000-strong peacekeeping mission in Haiti were still missing after the earthquake . \nThey included UN mission head Hedi Annabi of Tunisia and his chief deputy , Luis Carlos da Costa . \nHaitian President Rene Preval spoke of how he stepped over dead bodies and heard cries of those trapped in the parliament building . \nAs dawn broke , the extent of the damage and the number of casualties started to become clearer . \nThe Red Cross said up to three million people had been affected . \nPrime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive said he believed more than 100,000 people had died . \nDescribing the earthquake as a `` catastrophe '' , Haiti 's envoy to the US said the cost of the damage could run into billions of dollars . \nHaitian President Rene Preval described the scene in the capital as `` unimaginable '' . \n`` Parliament has collapsed . \nThe tax office has collapsed . \nHospitals have collapsed , '' he said . \nSpeaking in Washington , US President Barack Obama vowed `` unwavering support '' for Haiti after what he called a `` cruel and incomprehensible '' disaster . \nUN officials said at least 14 people had died when the UN 's five-storey headquarters and two smaller buildings in Port-au-Prince collapsed . \nAround 100 were still thought to be missing , many feared to be under the rubble . \nPeople in the capital were lifting sheets on bodies to try to identify loved ones . \nThe quake - Haiti 's worst in two centuries - struck at 1653 -LRB- 2153 GMT -RRB- . \nPhone lines to the country failed shortly afterwards . \nThe US Geological Survey said its epicentre was 15km -LRB- 10 miles -RRB- south-west of Port-au-Prince , and that it was quickly followed by two strong aftershocks of 5.9 and 5.5 magnitude . \nThe extent of the devastation was initially unclear . \nIn a statement issued in New York , the UN said that its local HQ in Haiti had `` sustained serious damage along with other UN installations '' and `` a large number '' of personnel were missing . \nRachmani Domersant , an operations manager with the Food for the Poor charity , told Reuters : `` You have thousands of people sitting in the streets with nowhere to go . \nThere are people running , crying , screaming . '' \nBodies white with dust could be seen piled on the back of a pick-up truck as vehicles tried to ferry the injured to hospital . \nIn the minutes after the quake , Henry Bahn , a visiting official from the US Department of Agriculture , said he had seen houses which had tumbled into a ravine . \n`` Everybody is just totally , totally freaked out and shaken , '' said Mr Bahn , who described the sky as `` just gray with dust '' . \n"}

'' \nThere is also chaos and confusion . \nThe aftermath of every natural disaster is chaotic . \nBut Haiti is especially so . \nEvery aid agency and non-governmental organization -LRB- NGO -RRB- in the world seems to have poured in to Port-au-Prince . \nIn the UN compound next to the airport clean-cut young men and women strut around in T-shirts proclaiming `` Scientologist Volunteers '' . \nIn a bar across the street a group of Belgian men are drinking beer . \nOutside their large white lorry has a banner draped across it with the name of their own tiny environmental NGO . \n`` We want to help , but the World Food Programme says they already have enough water trucks , '' they tell me . \nBut if the UN base is chaotic , it 's nothing to the Haitian government compound . \nIt 's housed in an old concrete police station just down the road . \nThe car park is crammed with large four-wheel drives jostling for position and hooting loudly . \nWe manage to track down Charles Clermont , the Haitian official charged with building the mass tent cities that will supposedly house the hundreds of thousands of refugees from Port-au-Prince . \n`` We started work the day after the earthquake , '' he assures me , `` the first camp will be up and running within the next few days . '' \nSurprised , I ask him where it is . \n`` It is on the outskirts of the city , there is running water and there will be electricity and spaces , it will be operational within a few days , '' Mr Clermont says . \nIntrigued , I take down the details of the location and head out of town . \nThe place is an empty stretch of highway that runs out to the mountains north of Port-au-Prince . \nOne thing is immediately clear , there is no camp . \nInstead on a stony hillside we come across one of the most extraordinary sites I have ever seen . \nHundreds and hundreds of people , camping in the open . \nAs soon as I get out of the car a crowd surrounds me . \nOne young man speaks English . \nBroadcasting on FM radio daily in Haitian Creole at 0910 local time -LRB- 1410 GMT -RRB- , for 20 minutes Giving up-to-date information about where to get basic services and aid Also available on satellite and online , and via social media I ask him where he sleeps . \n`` On the ground , '' he answers , pointing to a patch of dirt further up the hill . \nI ask him if he has had any help , any food or water . \n`` No , '' he says , `` we have nothing .

'' \nBut they are in a difficult position . \nLike hundreds of other Haitian orphans , Lovely 's adoption papers were stored in government buildings that collapsed in the quake . \nAt the orphanage where Lovely lives , dozens of children have parents overseas , desperate to get them out . \nMost seem oblivious to the destruction around them . \nTheir smiles light up their faces - and ours . \nLovely is malnourished and has an infection on her arm Lovely is carried out to meet us . \nShe is tiny through malnourishment , her arm bears the sores of an infection and her eyes barely register our presence . \nBut what horrors she must have seen . \nThe 70 or so orphans here all survived the quake . \nWe see only the front of the building but it does not look seriously damaged , and the level of care seems good . \nBut two sister orphanages in Petionville and Leogane were badly damaged and those children are now here , a house overcrowded with tiny evacuees . \nThere are also American parents staying here . \nThey felt they could speed up the evacuation of their little ones by coming here in person . \nThey need the Haitian government to give its stamp of approval for the children to leave . \nBut an already lumbering bureaucracy has been knocked off its feet . \nConfusion reigns and leads to delays . \nThe buses drive through the airport gates and straight on to the tarmac . \nThis is what happens when the Americans speed things up In addition , some aid agencies are calling for a halt to adoptions , because they believe the earthquake has provided an opportunity for child traffickers . \nWith papers lost , it 's harder for would-be parents to prove they were already part of the adoption process before the earthquake , and the worry is criminals could take advantage . \nThat means Lovely and hundreds more children must wait and endure . \nThe next day we visit the US embassy , guarded by armed American soldiers . \nThey patrol outside and across the street , weapons on show , even though this is foreign soil . \nReporters are tolerated , Haitians moved on . \nWe see more than 100 people queuing in the blazing sun to get in . \nMore on nearby street corners , being corralled by US troops . \nMany hold yellow manila document envelopes . \nThe US says it is cutting through red tape to speed up existing adoptions . \nMany want to go , but many are turned away . \nI encounter a large group of very emotional women , all of them Haitian Americans who have traveled back to try to get loved ones out . \nBut they tell me officials wo n't let them bring all their family members back to America . \nMireille Plaisimond , from New York City , shows me some US home ownership papers - proof , she says , that she can support the four children she wants to take back to America . \nOther flights have taken Haitian orphans to new homes in France Christiane Joseph angrily brandishes her US passport , while Sandra Joseph Marquis from Florida wails : `` what is the point of being a US citizen if our government wo n't help us ? '' \nIt is clear that emotions are running high in the dusty heat of Haiti 's collapse . \nWhile we are at the embassy , I get a text from a man called Randy Presley from Oklahoma . \nOn my way to Haiti I had met him and his adopted Haitian daughter Eliana . \nThey were on their way back to rescue her four-year-old brother Christopher . \nNow Randy tells me they and 40 more orphans are inside the embassy unable to get out of the country . \nHe says they have been there for three days , sleeping on mats on the floor , refusing to leave . \nSeveral hours and many confused text messages later -LRB- our phones do n't work to make calls -RRB- , he tells me they are boarding buses for the airport . \nMore armed guards appear at the gate and then two buses pull out of the compound . \nOn board are Randy , his family , and 40 more Haitian children and their carers are on their way to a new life . \nThey wave as we draw alongside . \n`` We made it , '' Randy shouts out of the window as they speed past . \nWe follow as the buses drive through the airport gates and straight on to the tarmac . \nThis is what happens when the Americans speed things up . \nNext to a giant US military cargo plane is a passenger jet . \nIt has been privately chartered by a Mormon group , many of whom are adopting Haitian children . \nThe plane flew in the night before , loaded with supplies . \nThe plane ... is a frenzied scene , the cabin echoing with the wails of nervous children The children were supposed to be on it then , but were held up . \nThe pilot refused to leave without his precious cargo . \nNow , there are no delays . \nClutching documents that say `` evacuated orphan '' , the children and their carers clamor to board the plane . \nOne woman stands on the steps to the cabin clutching her adopted baby girl . \nShe looks around , choking back tears , as if taking in this scene of destruction for the last time . \nThen we are told that Lovely may be among this group . \nWe board the plane and start looking . \nIt is a frenzied scene , the cabin echoing with the wails of nervous children . \n`` Is that relief on your face ? '' \n`` For the ones that made it , yes , but for the ones I had to leave behind , no , '' she says . \nMany of the children from Lovely 's orphanage are here , but we ca n't see her . \nI show her photo around . \nSome people think they have seen her , others do n't know . \nWe get off the plane as the last children board . \nStill no sign of Lovely but we are sure she is in this group . \nA US official tells us she has seen the girl and will take us to her . \nWe walk across the tarmac , away from the plane , through the terminal building and out to the front where a row of white tents stand , covering several people in hospital-type clothes . \nThey are all cradling tiny children . \nLee Everton from Utah Hospital Task Force is holding her . \nShe is sleeping peacefully . \n`` The Haitian government did n't stamp her papers , '' he tells me , his eyes puffy and red . \n`` Does that mean she ca n't get on ? '' \nShe must go back to the orphanage while Haiti 's crumbled bureaucracy runs its course . \nHer new life in America must wait . \nI am dreading telling her parents . \nAs I pull out my phone , I see Bryan Benedict has already e-mailed me . \nThey are crushed by this setback , he tells me . \nAll the while , Lovely has remained fast asleep in Lee 's arms . \nAt least she is unaware of the chaos around her . \n"}

'' \nIt is estimated that some 2,000 people have had limbs amputated as a result of the earthquake . \nMany suffered crush injuries or quickly spreading infections which made amputations the only means to survive . \nBut , like many surgeons , Tony Redmond from the British medical charity Merlin says he is trying to fathom why the figure is so high . \n`` I 've worked during other disasters but nothing like this , '' he says , speaking from Emmanuel 's bedside . \n`` What we are faced with now are thousands of patients who need prosthetic limbs and rehabilitation . \nOnce the dust has settled , as an international medical community we really do need to look at this .

'' \nThe prospect of returning home to his sister-in-law 's house offers Mr Michelle some comfort but he knows in a country already gripped by high unemployment his prospects look bleak . \nCharities like Handicap International have been busy starting rehabilitation efforts on the patients , promising that truckloads of temporary prosthetic limbs will soon be on their way . \nBut many veterans of disasters fear the scale of this earthquake will overwhelm such well-meaning organizations because the numbers needing help are simply so great . \nThere are at least 2,000 people who lost their limbs in the Haiti earthquake - a figure far higher than a similar disaster in Pakistan five years ago , explains Celia Du Pre from Handicap International . \nThere are fears that amputees will not receive proper aftercare She treated patients in that emergency and says the key to success is to get them enrolled onto rehabilitation programs quickly and re-integrate them back into the community . \nBut communities have been shattered since the Haitian earthquake and health facilities and health staff have been wiped out in places . \nAlthough there have been huge acts of kindness between strangers in the worst tragedy this country has ever experienced , in true Darwinian fashion it is the fittest who fare best when it comes to food queues . \nOne of the immediate challenges is to ensure that those disabled by the earthquake are not pushed to the back . \n`` I am 100 % certain that Haiti does not have the human resources to cope in the longer term , '' declares Dr Henriette Chamouilles , country director for the World Health Organization in Haiti . \n`` We do n't have enough physiotherapists ? . \nWe need to make sure we have medical supplies and ensure patients who 've lost their limbs are registered with us , so we do n't lose them . '' \nFor the moment , the scale of the disaster has made amputations big news but Dr Chamouilles is among the many who fear that , without long-term international support , it will slip off the agenda and Haiti 's handicapped survivors will be forgotten . \n"}

'' \nBut our correspondent says the regulations are very clear - each case of child adoption must be approved by the government . \nKaren Allen , BBC News , Port-au-Prince In the grounds of a former children 's hospital , in one of the worst-affected areas of Port-au-Prince , there is a queue of about 200 women snaking around the building . \nIt 's all very orderly - the women are coming in and collecting a bag of rice which is to be shared between two families . \nSome distance away , behind security tape , the men are being held back . \nThe reason is that , in the past , food distribution points have been trigger points for potential violence and scuffles . \nThe UN estimates that up to a third of the population will be reliant on some kind of relief in the months to come . \nEven before the earthquake , he adds , child-smuggling was a massive problem in Haiti , with thousands of children disappearing each year . \nIn the capital Port-au-Prince , the UN 's World Food Programme -LRB- WFP -RRB- has begun feeding families - distributing food only to women - at a series of 16 sites across the capital . \nEach woman will receive a 25kg -LRB- 55lb -RRB- bag of rice , enough to feed her family for two weeks . \nOnly women will be allowed to collect earthquake relief supplies , because - the WFP says - this has proved that is the best way to get food to the people who need it . \nThe WFP will work with the local authorities to ensure that men in need of assistance are not excluded , it said . \n`` Up until now the nature of this emergency has forced us to work in a ` quick and dirty ' way simply to get food out , '' said Executive Director Josette Sheeran . \n`` This new system will allow us to provide food assistance to more people , more quickly through a robust network of fixed distribution sites . '' \nThe WFP says it has reached 600,000 people with over 16 million meals since the earthquake , amid huge logistical problems caused by damage to local infrastructure . \nMeanwhile , doctors working to treat survivors voiced concern over the US halting the evacuation of the critically injured to the country . \nDr Barth Green , Dr Cathy Burneit and Dr David Pitcher describe difficulties in Haiti A senior US medic told the BBC that scores of people injured in the earthquake could die if the US did not resume emergency evacuations soon . \n`` The consequences - in the kids with crushed chests and on ventilators and respirators , and some of the adults - are they will die , '' Barth Green , a senior American doctor at a field hospital in Port-au-Prince airport , told the BBC . \nThe US military stopped the flights to Florida on Wednesday . \nA White House spokesman told the BBC the move was due to `` logistical issues '' , not because of a row over medical costs as had been reported earlier . \nHundreds of patients with spinal injuries , burns and other wounds have been evacuated to the US since the 12 January quake that killed up to 200,000 people . \n"}

'' \nThey say that while images of the misery in Haiti can spread rapidly around the world , aid supplies and skilled people can not travel so fast . \n`` Haiti is definitely the most complex emergency to date , '' said Jean Philippe Chauzy of the International Organization for Migration -LRB- IOM -RRB- . \nHe said it was difficult for those not involved in emergency aid to understand how difficult the operations can be . \n`` The fact that the reporting is immediate might give the impression that aid can be sorted out in such a fashion , but you ca n't do that because of the scale of the operation and complexity . '' \nAid groups say supplies have been stuck at the airport While the main airport in Port-au-Prince was not put out of action by the quake , it is not equipped to deal with the volume of flights arriving . \nThere have been complaints of huge backlogs , with some aircraft circling for hours or being diverted to the Dominican Republic . \nPaul Peachy of Christian Aid said it had difficult even getting emergency staff to Haiti . \nThe UN says 150 planes are now landing daily in Port-au-Prince but the US Army , which has taken over control of the airport , says 1,500 planes are still scheduled to arrive . \nTo speed up the process , aid flights are also coming into and out of the neighbouring Dominican Republic and in smaller airports in Haiti . \nPort-au-Prince 's main port was also badly damaged by the quake and other ports in the area could only accept smaller vessels . \nOne of the two piers in the capital 's docks reopened on Thursday , allowing bulkier shipments to be delivered by sea . \nBut on Thursday , Haiti 's President Rene Preval joined several aid agencies in saying it is what happens when aid arrives in the country that is the problem . \n`` People say to us : Where are the trucks to transport the aid ? \nWhere are the depots to store what arrives ? '' \n`` What 's important is coordination of the aid , so that we know what we receive , in what quantity , when and how it 's distributed . '' \nDamaged roads make it harder to move resources around the country Moving aid to where it is needed has been hampered by damage to roads , piles of rubble in the streets or by the sheer volume of people trying to move out of or around the capital . \n`` Road corridors are heavy with traffic , so traveling takes hours , '' said Ms Byrs of the UN . \nAid agencies also report a lack of trucks and a lack of fuel but said supplies were now starting to arrive . \nThey also hope to start employing local people soon in rubble clearing so reconstruction can begin . \nThe fact that many roads were damaged also meant that survivors have tended to gather in small groups , rather than in larger camps , he said . \n`` It is very difficult to reach out systematically when you 've got hundreds of groups of people in Port-au-Prince and the vicinity , '' he said . \n`` If you manage to get tens of thousands of displaced people in one place you obviously streamline the distribution . '' \nThe US has carried out air drops of basic supplies in some areas , but this is considered a last resort as it is considered inefficient and can lead to unrest on the ground as people compete for the few supplies . \nAid groups were unable to broadcast information to camps Phones and internet links were down in many areas of Haiti for some time after the quake , making it harder for agencies to coordinate their efforts . \nMr Peachy of Christian Aid said it had been impossible to contact his colleagues in Haiti for the first 48 hours after the quake . \nBut Mr Chauzy of the IOM said the lack of communications also meant it was hard to tell people needing aid where they could go to collect it . \n`` Now the media is up and running , local radio station have started broadcasting and the UN 's Radio Minustah has started broadcasting in Creole , '' he said . \nMany NGOs based in Haiti lost staff and equipment in the disaster , which meant the systems they had in place could not be used . \nChristian Aid was one of many to lose its entire building . \nAside from the practical losses , many aid workers are also dealing with grief as they carry out their work . \n`` For the moment we are concentrating - and I would say escaping - with the work . \nAfter , we will experience the emotions , '' said Ms Byrs at the UN . \nArmed police have been deployed to deter looting and violence There has been concern about the security situation in Haiti , with fears that people not receiving aid would turn to violence . \nJohn O'Shea of Irish charity Goal told the Guardian newspaper he could not allow aid workers to move into Haiti from the Dominican Republican because he had `` no guarantee that the people driving them are not going to be macheted to death on the way down '' . \nBut while there have been reports of looting and some incidents of violence , other agencies say they have been impressed by how Haitians have responded to the disaster . \nMs Byrs said the capital was `` tense but calm '' and that the few examples of violence were not representative of Haitian people . \n`` We are seeing a huge solidarity between Haitian people . \nThey resilient , they taken their fate into own hands from the very beginning , '' she said . \nJean Philippe Chauzy of French agency Acted said the security issues in Haiti should neither be over-played nor used as an excuse to prevent aid deliveries . \n`` The needs are there , people are desperate , if you do n't distribute the assistance , people will be even more desperate and ready to resort to anything . '' \nOn Thursday , a truck run by the US-based Catholic Relief Service was reported to have been overrun by desperate people when it arrived at a makeshift camp in the town of Leogane . \nBut Adrien Tomarchio of Acted says the main safety concern has been for those people receiving aid . \n`` The best process is not to start distribution at once and announce it so everyone comes , '' he says . \n`` We make sure we can set up a proper secured distribution point , where people can come one-by-one . \nThe aim is to deliver to the most vulnerable people first , then we also can focus on other groups . '' \nThe US Army has been deployed in vast numbers in Haiti , both to help with the aid effort and to help maintain law and order . \nThe US has tens of thousands of troops in the country Medecins Sans Frontieres -LRB- MSF -RRB- has complained that the rush to get troops into the country has been at the expense of the delivery of humanitarian supplies . \n`` Everything has been mixed together and the urgent and vital attention to the people have been delayed while military logistics - which is useful but not on day three , not on day four , but maybe on day eight - has really jammed the airport and led to this mismanagement . '' \nMSF say one of its planes carrying 12 tonnes of medical supplies was repeatedly turned away from the airport despite having prior permission to land . \nJohn O'Shea of Goal said the failure of the UN and US to work together was leading to `` a situation of utter chaos '' . \nThe UN has dismissed such criticism , saying it `` underestimated the logistical difficulties '' and that the US was the only country in the region capable of providing logistical support on the scale needed . \n`` We are not talking about politics , this is humanitarian . \nOur goal is to delivery assistance as soon as possible and co-ordination is vital - without it you ca n't get the right aid to the most vulnerable , '' said spokeswoman Ms Byrs . \nAid agencies are keen to stress that the response to a disaster such as Haiti must be responsible and durable . \nThe last thing they want is for the mechanisms they put in place to lead to long term harm for the people they are trying to help . \nBadly managed distributions can mean the most needy go without Adrien Tomarchio , of French agency Acted , told the BBC the aim when distributing food is to get it to the right people quickly , rather than just get it out quickly . \n`` If we distribute food all at once , some people will take more then they need and there is the risk of them selling food items , rather than it reaching the people that need it , '' he said . \n`` The aim is to deliver to the most vulnerable people , then we can focus on other groups . '' \nIn the case of shelter , there is little point in building a camp for displaced people without confirming they will be able to stay there , possibly for many months . \nAgencies have had to work with the local authorities to determine whether the land is suitable , whether it can be properly equipped with shelter and sanitation . \nLand rights issues also do not disappear after a disaster , so agencies have to establish who owns the land on which they hope to build . \n`` You ca n't just go there and get land , level it and start building , '' says Jean Philippe Chauzy of IOM . \nHaiti 's rainy season begins in May or June , so camps can not be placed in areas which are likely to be flooded in the next few months . \nIOM , working with troops from Minustah , have started clearing a patch of land in a suburb about 10km out of Port-au-Prince , but say further camps will almost certainly be needed . \nAs recovery begins , it is important that as many Haitians that can return to work do . \nA camp which is too far away from the capital for them to be able to travel in for work will benefit no one . \n"}

'' \nDown a lane , the wreckage of the village church hanging over them , a group of people with buckets patiently wait to get water . \nIt is impossible to see how Haiti can recover from this earthquake They have managed to uncover a plastic pipe protruding from beneath the broken tarmac of the road - the first fresh drinking water to flow here in a week . \nWithin a few minutes the flow stops . \nOn the telegraph pole that rises next to them is a makeshift sign that says : `` Help needed . \nWater , food , medicine . '' \nThere are too many of these signs in Port-au-Prince - and too many people who are waiting for someone to do what they say . \nOne week on , it is impossible to see how Haiti can recover from this earthquake . \nThe fund-raising effort around the world has been truly incredible . \nIn the middle of one of the worst recessions in living memory , people have been giving money as perhaps never before . \nThat money , though , is mostly sitting on the tarmac at the capital 's airport at the moment - it is not getting to the people in need . \nThis is in part because of the immense logistical difficulties facing the aid organizations . \nCommunications are very , very difficult . \nCo-ordinating who gets help and when is made all the more difficult because of what was an already poor infrastructure . \nThey treat us like dogs . \nWhy do n't they feed us like humans ? \nOn the ground , though , it seems that more should be possible . \nIn every single one of the makeshift camps I visited , large and small , people asked where the help was . \nThe UN World Food Programme says that one of the big problems of distributing aid is the risk of riots . \nThere have been some chaotic scenes when UN staff have tried to hand out food , but I have never felt at risk . \nIt may , however , explain why outside a camp the other day some sacks of rice were left in the middle of the night . \nThere is no knowing who left the food there , but the homeless people living in the camp say it was an aid organization , that the food was dumped in the road , and that by the time the people found it much of the rice had spilt across the road itself . \n`` They treat us like dogs , '' one man said . \n`` Why do n't they feed us like humans ? '' \nIt is an obvious question . \nSurely with the thousands of peacekeepers here , if the fear really is that the situation really could get out of control , the UN could cordon off an area of each camp , bring in food and water and carefully and safely hand it out ? \nIn a bid to speed up aid deliveries , US troops have stepped up their presence Surely the aid agencies could work with the UN and the US to do the same ? \nSurely US troops - of which there are thousands on the ground already -LRB- though it has been hard to see any at all in Port-au-Prince itself so far , apart from those that fly overhead -RRB- - could also help secure areas so that crowd control is easier ? \nBut these things are not happening , and the people of Haiti can not understand why . \nI have seen some tents that clearly have come from outside , and which now are sheltering the homeless , but only a tiny number . \nIn the meantime , more than a million people are living out in the open , under a sheet , or a rectangle of tarpaulin . \nThe question that urgently needs answering , is why is it taking so long ? \nBecause unless the situation changes , Haiti 's crisis will deepen , and many more will die . \n"}

\nI opted for the clothes but realized those vital seconds could be a matter of life and death . \nThe earth seemed to settle and after hanging around for a while , we went back inside . \nIn the Mariani neighborhood of Port-au-Prince where we work , primary needs identified so far are food , shelter , chlorine tablets for water and medical attention . \nWe piloted our food distribution two days ago and it all went well thanks to a local donation of high protein food for children made by SCMS - an international NGO distributing pharmaceutical products for HIV patients . \nI woke up this morning to hear people screaming and my bed shaking We 're confident the local committees have the capacity to distribute large quantities of food and we 're taking measures to guard against any kind of hoarding and prejudice against women and children . \nWe have bought several tonnes of food from the Dominican Republic for distribution tomorrow . \nWe will also be exploring local food sources from small farmers ' cooperatives outside Port-au-Prince so that aid efforts do n't damage local prices over the coming months . \nIn Mariani , water is plentiful but it 's not potable . \nInstead of giving out water bottles , we will be giving out chlorine tablets to prevent more rubbish accumulating in the capital . \nAlthough ActionAid does n't normally work in the field of medicine , lots of people are dying due to lack of medical care . \nMany are dying from simple wounds which have become septic or gangrenous and there is a lack of antibiotics , bandages , syringes and plaster for castes . \nRed Cross and ActionAid have begun talks on how they can work together through the voluntary committees which have sprung up inside the camps to guarantee medical attention . \nWomen and children 's safety is also a serious concern . \nWe have already started working with psychiatric professionals to develop a mid-term plan for treating post traumatic stress among women and children in the refugee camps . \nI have been spending my nights in an aircraft hangar for almost a full week now and have got used to the constant roar of engines from the huge cargo planes constantly taking-off and landing . \nBut this morning I was jolted awake by the sound of the entire hangar rattling and groaning - it was an earthquake . \nJust as I made it outside the earth stopped shaking and there was quiet . \nThe fear was evident when we arrived at the national hospital . \nOperation Blessing is installing 10 water purification units in Haiti During the quake all the patients were evacuated and none of them wanted to go back inside . \nSo the narrow lanes in the hospital were crammed with patients and doctors under the blazing sun . \nWe saw operations taking place in the open air while cars spewed exhaust fumes across the procedure . \nDead bodies pulled from rubble near the hospital were wheeled to the morgue past lines of patients . \nOperation Blessing installed a large water purification unit in the hospital , put in a line with a tap and provided clean water to serve the 3,000 patients and medical staff on the compound . \nTomorrow we will be installing another unit at the soccer stadium where we set up our field hospital . \nThe hospital now has teams of French and US doctors working alongside our Israeli team . \nISABELLE JEANSON , MEDECINS SANS FRONTIERES I had the scare of my life this morning . \nI had hoped I could sleep-in an extra 10 minutes because I 've been working on five hours sleep a night for the last week and am hitting the bottom of the barrel . \nI suddenly felt my sleeping bag on the bedroom floor rocking back and forth . \nFor about a second I thought maybe I was dizzy from being tired . \nBut that thought did n't last long when the rocking got stronger . \nI jumped up , scrambled to the door in the dim morning light in my pyjamas and ran downstairs . \nI was shaking and on the verge of crying , and so was my colleague . \nHe had survived the quake last week , but he still had the courage to run back inside the house to get our two other colleagues out . \nIsabelle Jeanson : `` It hurts to see so many injured children and adults . '' \nMy heart was racing . \nI finally understood the meaning of vulnerable , to be so exposed to this overwhelming force . \nThat was the start to this day . \nThis afternoon I spent a few hours at our field hospital in Carrefour . \nThe entrance is through gray thick plastic sheeting , which is attached to two trees , spanning across a street in the middle of the town . \nThis is the triage area , a wound-dressing area , and an inpatient ward . \nIt hurts to see so many injured children and adults , some screaming in pain as their dressing gets changed by a nurse . \nThey have serious burns , wounds that are infected , broken arms , deep cuts in the skull , gangrened limbs , and the list goes on . \nThere are pregnant women who are giving birth , or who need c-sections and beds for more serious surgery , such as amputations . \nIn the five hours I was there , the team did at least three amputations , two for young children . \nThey removed necrotic tissue on a young woman 's thigh , and did a c-section . \nOur team is tired . \nThey have been working long , long hours in the heat , in crowded , noisy , demanding and stressful conditions . \nFortunately , we 've located a brand new spacious school building that was not affected by the earthquake , just down the street from our hospital . \nWe hope to move to this new location in the coming days . \nThe one shining light in all this physical and emotional suffering is the birth of healthy little babies . \nEight healthy little new ones arrived today under the blue tarp of our hospital . \nWe all need them to breathe new life and hope into this torn country . \n"}

the elderly , the children and whoever was sick before and these are people who survived the actual quake . \nMy grandmother is not a strong woman . \nI have not slept since the earthquake and I am upset that I can not help my grandmother when she needs it the most . \nThe embassy in Haiti is overcrowded and they wo n't pay any attention to us Ideally we would like to get both my grandmother and great-uncle out but they have no way of leaving . \nGrandmother does not have a green card and we would like to try and get her a visa to come to the US temporarily while Haiti is being rebuilt . \nThe embassy in Haiti is overcrowded and they wo n't pay any attention to us . \nWe do n't know what to do . \nAn uncle here in the US is trying to get a flight to Haiti to take some supplies but it 's difficult getting on a flight . \nThe airlines are asking so much . \nWe are trying our best to not let them die but it 's going to be hard . \nI have about 50 relatives in Haiti but with the exception of my grandmother , great-uncle and cousin , everyone else is missing and unaccounted for . \nTHERLINE LOUIS , RELATIVES IN LEOGANE My 29-year-old twin brothers Nikenson and Makenson Louis are in Leogane and when I spoke to them they told me that they have not seen any aid in their part of town as yet . \nThey have set up a tent outside their house and are sleeping in the street . \nThey were able to retrieve some supplies from inside the house which they are sharing with the neighbors but now food and water are running low . \nAid is needed in the different parts of Haiti affected by the earthquake and not just the capital . \nMy brother Mark did manage to travel from Leogane to Port-au-Prince in search of food and help for the women and children . \nWhile people have survived , if they do not get the help that they need they will die My mum has a nephew in Santo Domingo and she is trying to get in touch with him to see if my relatives in Leogane would be able to go and stay there for a while . \nI am not sure how possible this will be as from what I have been hearing the roads are completely devastated . \nWhile people have survived , if they do not get the help that they need they will die . \n"}

{"id": "752", "time": "2010-01-26", "text": "Large areas of Aceh were flattened by the 2004 tsunami The last international disaster on the scale of the January earthquake in Haiti was the tsunami that devastated coastlines across Asia in 2004 . \nThe death toll in the territory of Aceh in Indonesia was similar to that in the Haitian capital , Port-au-Prince . \nThe BBC 's International Development Correspondent David Loyn , who reported from both towns , looks at the differences in the international response . \nWithin days of the tsunami hitting Aceh , on the northern tip of the island of Sumatra in Indonesia , an Australian army combat engineering battalion had landed with a large force of trucks , earth-moving equipment , and water purification systems . \nThey were the most visible sign of an international response that swiftly brought ashore huge quantities of food , shelter , and basic sanitation . \nA fleet of vessels , including a Greenpeace ship in the area , was commandeered to move aid to where it was needed across a wide area . \nUS army efforts in Haiti focused on water and basic meals In contrast , the most visible sign of aid in the same timeframe in Haiti was the sight of US Navy helicopters ferrying ready-to-eat meals and bottled water from the fleet anchored offshore . \nAid professionals shook their heads at this approach - so good on TV , but so ineffective at delivering the quantities of relief necessary to help the three million people believed to have been affected by the Haiti earthquake . \nBut at least the US forces were doing something . \nIn the squalid makeshift camps that emerged on the streets and on any open ground in Port-au-Prince there was no sign of the shelter , sanitation nor packs of basic essentials like soap and buckets that usually characterise the first wave of aid donations . \nSo what had gone wrong ? \nWhen there was such huge international generosity , both by governments and individuals , why has it taken so long for effective aid to reach those who need it ? \nPart of the answer lay in the security briefings that aid agencies received . \nThe fear of insecurity can become a self-fulfilling prophecy Some isolated scenes of looting and the sound of occasional gunfire reinforced the view of security advisers that the streets of Port-au-Prince were a war zone , and it found itself re-categorised into the same bracket of cities that included Baghdad and Kabul . \nThat kept many aid workers firmly behind the safety fence at the UN compound . \nAnother problem came in the sheer scale of the US military deployment . \nAn aid official from a major and reputable international organization told me last week that when he had tried to secure landing rights for a relief flight from Europe , he was told by the US authorities that the next available landing slot `` was on 9 February '' . \nThe airstrip is filled instead with US transport planes bringing in troops and military equipment . \nThe problem is that this bottleneck means that the threat of worsening security could become a self-fulfilling prophecy . \nIf they do not deliver the aid fast , they will need all those troops . \nDespite the enormous loss of life , the Haitian response to the earthquake has been characterised by the patience and resolve of a people who have suffered much . \nBut patience is not limitless . \nThe most effective response has come from the World Food Programme -LRB- WFP -RRB- , which has succeeded in raising food distribution from a few thousand a day to hundreds of thousands . \nHaiti 's economy and infrastructure were struggling even before the quake But because of the enormous need and failures elsewhere in the system they need to spend far more time negotiating security issues than they otherwise might . \nThe third major issue in Haiti was in the lack of coordination of aid . \nOne reason for this was the huge loss of life in the UN system - more than 80 dead , including the head of mission . \nBut there was similar dislocation to the staff of aid agencies in Aceh , and there the system recovered far more quickly , so that a new co-ordination network could deliver aid across a far wider area than was affected in Haiti . \nThe biggest difference between the two countries was their starting point . \nIndonesia is a rapidly developing nation , while Haiti is the only country in the western hemisphere on that unenviable UN list of those defined as Least Developed Countries -LRB- LDCs -RRB- . \nCorruption and the legacy of colonial interference have conspired against good governance . \nAt the best of times , water and power are unreliable , and the streets are filled with rotting refuse . \nSo it was hard to expect the efficient disposal of more than 100,000 corpses , while broken water mains continue to flood streets that were not otherwise affected by the earthquake . \n"}

'' \nSome of the congregation have lost their homes , others are too afraid to return to theirs - they fear being raped , if they are found alone . \nMadame Pierre has lived in Cite Soleil since 1969 , and says things have never been worse . \nThe quake damaged many of the homes of those who live in Cite Soleil `` The situation has never been easy for us , '' she said . \n`` But this is the most difficult moment , and the most dangerous . \nWe have had no aid from anyone , and there 's no-one to protect us . \nOur only protection is from God , '' she said , raising her arms to the sky . \nSince the earthquake there are new dangers in Haiti 's most notorious slum . \nThe earthquake has created a security vacuum across the capital . \nAnd more than 4,000 prisoners escaped from the ruins of the capital 's main jail . \nThey have come back home to Cite Soleil , according to the dapper local prosecutor , Evens Leveque - a man who often travels with armed guards . \nWe found him rushing to a meeting with the Cite Soleil police chief , to discuss a shoot-out the night before . \nThere is no death penalty in Haiti . \nWhen citizens catch one of those bandits they are supposed to hold them and call the police , not lynch them . \nAs a judge I know it is unjust and illegal `` The situation is disastrous , '' he said . \n`` The prisoners came back here with guns in their hands to terrorise the population . \nBut we , as the local authorities , are not going to let that happen . '' \nHaving put the gangs behind bars once , he intends to do it again . \n`` We have received orders , '' he says . \n`` And we 'll do it , whether it takes one or two months , or one or two years , unless they have run off somewhere else , or escaped to the countryside . '' \nIn the meantime , he says , some of the local population have taken matters into their own hands , lynching gang members in the streets . \n`` There is no death penalty in Haiti . \nWhen citizens catch one of those bandits they are supposed to hold them and call the police , not lynch them . \nAs a judge I know it is unjust and illegal . '' \nBut he also knows that many in the slum have lost faith in Haitian justice . \n`` When people are arrested , sometimes they are free weeks afterwards because the judicial system in Haiti is weak , and our prisons are not adequate , '' he says . \nLying in his bed in a nearby hospital , Brine Cedernier knows only too well about the gun law on the streets . \nHalf his stomach is covered by dressings applied to his bullet wounds . \nHis nephew , Rony , sits by his bedside , gently wiped the perspiration from his brow . \nUntil two days ago , Brine supported them both , by providing lifts on his motorbike . \nThen he was attacked in the neighbouring slum . \n`` I was on my motorbike and three guys came , '' he says . \n`` They told me to kneel down . \nThey took the bike and shot me - twice . \nSince the earthquake , the gangs are stealing and looting and killing people . '' \nEighteen-year-old Rony looks away , with tears streaming down his face . \nHaving already lost his father in the earthquake , he can not bear the thought of losing his uncle . \nOn the streets of the seaside slum , gun law is the only law `` He 's the only one I have left who loves me , '' he said . \n`` He 's all I have . '' \nBrine is being treated by staff from Medecins Sans Frontieres . \nThey have returned to the local hospital in Cite Soleil , where they have been based in previous crises . \nMSF veterans here say they are not hearing as much gunfire as they did in the past . \nBut they are treating two to three shooting victims a day , and they have been busy with births , amputations , and some machete wounds from looting . \nSome food aid is getting through to the slum . \nWe saw people waiting patiently for aid in long orderly queues , under the watchful eye of United Nations troops . \nBut we saw no sign of the police during our visit - except in the courtyard of their headquarters . \nJust across the road , there is a bullet-riddled ruin - a symbol of the slum . \nBack outside the Church of Saint Temple of Olivier , the faithful say they will continue their vigil . \n`` We have to stay here together , and keep praying , '' said Madame Pierre . \n`` We ca n't risk separating . \nWe pray to God to see the next day , and we pray not to be a victim .

'' \nNick and his two GP colleagues found themselves treating wounded and ill patients outside hospital and med-evacuating them , when it was possible , to field hospitals . \nHe was involved in helping one women , Sonia , who 's rescue was captured by TV crews . \nShe had survived in a collapsed building although her 19-year-old daughter was lying dead beside her . \nNick said : `` She 's very lucky - the space she was trapped in allowed her to breathe lying flat on her back . \nIt just was fate that some people had enough air to survive , other people did n't and died . '' \nThe death toll following the earthquake is estimated at 150,000 John Taylor was part of Hampshire Fire and Rescue 's medical support team and is also a part-time retained firefighter . \nHe explained : `` My role was providing medical care for casualties - there is a long period while the digging is going on and that can be quite frustrating . \n`` I did go underground during one rescue and that was pretty claustrophobic and pretty unpleasant inside the building - but once you get them out , it is hugely rewarding . \nBut then we had to struggle to find somewhere to treat them when there were no hospitals in the first few days , but we did manage it . '' \nMedical workers faced a range of injuries to deal with , from dehydration to broken bones - with overwhelming numbers of people needing help . \nJohn said : `` You ca n't ignore people you come across . \nIt is difficult - there are people everywhere with injuries or in desperate need . \nYou 've only got what you can carry so you have limited resources so you just do what you can - it 's difficult . '' \nThe team have experience of dealing with the immediate aftermath of other disasters including the Pakistan earthquake of 2005 . \nOn this occasion they were initially hampered by transport delays and the organisational difficulties in the chaos of the immediate aftermath of the quake . \nWhen they did arrive in Haiti they set up their organisational base in the relative security of the airport . \nKeith Bellamy set up the support facilities for the rescue teams Hampshire Search and Rescue 's Keith Bellamy was in charge of setting up the logistics to support the 64-strong team of UK firefighters , providing them with food , drinking water , power and fuel to operate effectively . \nHe explained : `` There was a lot of devastation and confusion initially when we first arrived , but when we find out what 's happened we bring our own controlled procedures into play . \n`` Our equipment was delayed by 24 hours , that did n't stop the teams going out searching . '' \nThe Hampshire staff had to co-ordinate the work of colleagues from other UK fire brigades but also work with other international rescue teams , United Nations , military and civilian aid agencies on the ground in Haiti . \nThe 11-day mission , co-ordinated from Hampshire 's Fire and Rescue 's Headquarters in Eastleigh was the UK team 's longest overseas deployment with a record number of rescues . \nPeter Crook , the national co-ordinator for UKISAR paid tribute to how the team reacted to the difficulties : `` They are some of the best firefighters in the world , they 're extremely resourceful . \nThings never go completely right , the team are fantastic at getting round things - they 'll find solutions .

'' \nChris 's main point was that God was there in the suffering - a real presence . \n`` When you talk to people in the front line -LRB- aid workers and so on -RRB- they often say that they are aware of the presence of God in the midst of all this brokenness and in this mess and chaos . \n`` Rather than being a remote being , He 's there with us ? \nGod is in the pain and the brokenness . '' \nI asked Chris why creation is apparently imperfect , allowing disasters , like the earthquake to happen . \nChris said , `` I 'm not a scientist but as I understand it , if there is to be a physical world with carbon and organic life forms , that world carries with it fire , earthquake , wind and viruses . \n`` It 's the only world that can exist . \nCreation involving stuff carries with it fragility and the potential for chaos . '' \nInterestingly , Chris said that in the face of such events only a silence , a prayerful silence , is the authentic response . \nBishop Tim has asked churches in the diocese to use the prayer below for Haiti . \nwe hold before you the nation and people of Haiti , and pray for healing in the midst of tragedy and devastation . \nGive comfort to the homeless , the bereaved and the suffering , wisdom to those who seek to help , and light to all who live in the shadow of death . \nThis we ask in the name of Jesus Christ , our rock and our salvation . \n"}
{"id": "174", "time": "2010-01-19", "text": "Why does God allow natural disasters ? \nAt the heart of Haiti 's humanitarian crisis is an age old question for many religious people - how can God allow such terrible things to happen ? \nPhilosopher David Bain examines the arguments . \nEvil has always been a thorn in the side of those - of whatever faith - who believe in an all-knowing , all-powerful , all-good God . \nAs the philosopher David Hume -LRB- echoing Epicurus -RRB- put it in 1776 : `` Is God willing to prevent evil , but not able ? \nThen he is impotent . \nIs he able , but not willing ? \nThen he is malevolent . \nIs he both able and willing ? \nWhence then is evil ? '' \nFaced with this question , Archbishop of York John Sentamu said he had `` nothing to say to make sense of this horror '' , while another clergyman , Canon Giles Fraser , preferred to respond `` not with clever argument but with prayer '' . \nI have nothing to say that makes sense of this horror - all I know is that the message of the death and resurrection of Jesus is that he is with us Archbishop of York , John Sentamu Perhaps their stance is understandable . \nThe Old Testament is also not clear to the layman on such matters . \nWhen Job complains about the injuries God has allowed him to suffer , and claims `` they are tricked that trusted '' , God says nothing to rebut the charges . \nLess reticent is the American evangelist Pat Robertson . \nHe has suggested Haiti has been cursed ever since the population swore a pact with the Devil to gain their freedom from the French at the beginning of the 19th Century . \nRobertson 's claim will strike many as ludicrous , if not offensive . \nAnd even were it true , it would n't obviously meet the challenge . \nWhy would a loving deity allow such a pact to seem necessary ? \nWhy would n't he have freed the Haitians from slavery himself , or prevented them from being enslaved in the first place ? \nAnd why , in particular , would he punish today 's Haitians for something their forbears putatively did more than two centuries before ? \nSo what should believers say ? \nTo make progress , we might distinguish two kinds of evil : the awful things people do , such as murder , and the awful things that just happen , such as earthquakes Would those hailed as brave still exist in a Magical World ? \nSt Augustine , author CS Lewis and others have argued God allows our bad actions since preventing them would undermine our free will , the value of which outweighs its ill effects . \nBut there 's a counter-argument . \nThoroughly good people are n't robots , so why could n't God have created only people like them , people who quite freely live good lives ? \nHowever that debate turns out , it 's quite unclear how free will is supposed to explain the other kind of evil - the death and suffering of the victims of natural disasters . \nPerhaps it would if all the victims - even the newborn - were so bad that they deserved their agonising deaths , but it 's impossible to believe that is the case . \nOr perhaps free will would be relevant if human negligence always played a role . \nThere will be some who say the scale of the tragedy in natural disasters is partly attributable to humans . \nThe world has the choice to help its poorer parts build earthquake-resistant structures and tsunami warning systems . \nA still smoking Krakatoa in 1883 , which caused a devastating tsunami But the technology has not always existed . \nWas prehistoric man , with his sticks and stones , somehow negligent in failing to build early warning systems for the tsunamis that were as deadly back then as they are today ? \nThe second century saint , Irenaeus , and the 20th Century philosopher , John Hick , appeal instead to what is sometimes called soul-making . \nGod created a universe in which disasters occur , they think , because goodness only develops in response to people 's suffering . \nTo appreciate this idea , try to imagine a world containing people , but literally no suffering . \nCall it the Magical World . \nIn that world , there are no earthquakes or tsunamis , or none that cause suffering . \nIf people are hit by falling masonry , it somehow bounces off harmlessly . \nIf I steal your money , God replaces it . \nIf I try to hurt you , I fail . \nSo why did n't God create the Magical World instead of ours ? \nBecause , the soul-making view says , its denizens would n't be - could n't be - truly good people . \nIt 's not that they would all be bad . \nIt 's that they could n't be properly good . \nFor goodness develops only where it 's needed , the idea goes , and it 's not needed in the Magical World . \nIn that world , after all , there is no danger that requires people to be brave , so there would be no bravery . \nThat world contains no one who needs comfort or kindness or sympathy , so none would be given . \nIt 's a world without moral goodness , which is why God created ours instead . \nBut there is wiggle room . \nEven in a world where nothing bad happens , could n't there be brave people - albeit without the opportunity to show it ? \nSo moral goodness could exist even if it were never actually needed . \nAnd , anyway , suppose we agree moral goodness could indeed develop only in a world of suffering . \nDoes n't our world contain a surplus of suffering ? \nPeople do truly awful things to each other . \nIs n't the suffering they create enough for soul-making ? \nDid God really need to throw in earthquakes and tsunamis as well ? \nSuffering 's distribution , not just its amount , can also cause problems . \nA central point of philosopher Immanuel Kant 's was that we must n't exploit people - we must n't use them as mere means to our ends . \nBut it can seem that on the soul-making view God does precisely this . \nHe inflicts horrible deaths on innocent earthquake victims so that the rest of us can be morally benefitted . \nIt 's OK , some will insist , because God works in mysterious ways . \nBut might n't someone defend a belief in fairies by telling us they do too ? \nOthers say their talk of God is supposed to acknowledge not the existence of some all-powerful and all-good agent , who created and intervenes in the universe , but rather something more difficult to articulate - a thread of meaning or value running through the world , or perhaps something ineffable . \nBut , as for those who believe in an all-good , all-powerful agent-God , we 've seen that they face a question that remains pressing after all these centuries , and which is now horribly underscored by the horrors in Haiti . \nIf a deity exists , why did n't he prevent this ? \nDavid Bain is a lecturer in the philosophy department of the University of Glasgow . \nBelow is a selection of your comments . \nAs an Anglican , I always had presumed that God is too big , if you like , too omnipotent to even vaguely notice humanity , after all we are dust : `` from dust you are made and to dust you shall return '' . \nThough the thought of that kind of horror being suffered by many innocents - and an apparent loving God is contradicting . \nHowever at least I find comfort , and probably most Christians , in the world to come where everything would be good , If you like God repaying his debts for letting us suffer . \nThe reason why good does not reduce suffering and evil in the world is simply because he does not exist ! \nOr if he does he does not care about humans at least on a individual basis , I am not sure he cares about them on a species basis . \nWhy does he not look after all the animal species that are facing extinction ? \nEvolution explains must of human behavior and geology and physics explains most natural disasters . \nIf God intervened , there would be evidence . \nHe would have to thwart the laws of physics or\\/warn people . \nGod made man as his greatest creation . \nIn order for humans to be all they can be we must live in a world like this one . \nMoral courage ca n't just be a potentiality , it must be an actuality in all it 's complexity for it to mean anything . \nAlso , in order for the world to be able to create and sustain the complexity of life that it has , the crust of the earth must move , must regenerate itself . \nThus , earthquakes , tsunamis . \nAll religious people can do in the face of a catastrophe is to do what we can to alleviate the suffering and possibly create a world where these sorts of things have much less impact . \nIs n't the real tragedy of Haiti the poverty that has blighted the island , that lead to substandard buildings and poor infrastructure ? \nThis is as much a man-made disaster as divine . \nThis is a transient life , the real life will come later . \nWe as humans have got a warped sense about what this life means to us , we ignore the reality of the next world . \nSo if your time is up and you die hopefully you were on the path of doing good . \nThere is a story of Khizer & Moses , when the former kills a child and Moses is aghast . \nKhizer tells him that the child would have grown up and killed his parents for greed . \nSo if Khizer knows that how can we question God when children pass away . \nAs the article also points out , it 's a test for the rest of us to see how we respond to the suffering of others . \nMaybe we can learn to look after the old folks in the neighborhood when we are moved to help people as far away as Haiti ? \nDebating the intentions of a mythological character which allegedly has an interest in allowing ` bad ' things to happen on planet earth ? \nAre we living in the 21st century or the 12th century ? \nNatural disasters , disease , accidents and co-incidences are all things that occur naturally and not as the result of the will of any fantastical all powerful Monster . \nMaybe a comet will hit the earth one day and maybe all that will be left will be a copy of Dr. Dolittle . \nJust because somebody wrote it down does not make it true . \nPerhaps you should include non god-based religions to get out of this dilemma . \nTry Buddhism for example . \nIsabelle Clinton , Forest Row , United Kingdom God has put us in a ` crucible ' and he is very interested in how we cope by us invoking the law of love . \nNo one is immune from tragedy , not least his own son Jesus . \nSo , its more about loving our neighbors rather than puzzling why . \nWe live in a dangerous world let no one doubt it . \nSome disasters are natural but many others are of our own making but throughout we must live the law of love . \nThe Japanese -LRB- 90 % Buddhist -RRB- have a saying that pain is our best friend . \nBecause for the most part we learn and grow the most from painful experiences . \nIf we are not born new , but simply coming around for another shot at growth -LRB- reincarnation -RRB- , then the notion of a child being pure is put aside . \nIf pain is our friend , then the notion of pain as cruel is put aside . \nIf death is not the end , then the notion of unfair or untimely death being the worst thing imaginable is put aside . \nJohn Roberts , Tulsa , Oklahoma USA A thoughtful article on an enduring problem . \nGod is perfectly good and perfectly powerful . \nHaiti was fully within his control . \nWhy did it happen ? \nBecause men 's deeds are evil . \nNot particularly - see Jesus on the Tower of Siloam - `` repent , or you too will perish '' . \nBecause there are murderers and rapists in the world ? \nNot just them - there is no one good , not even one , all have turned away and fallen short of the glory of God . \nJon Hall , Jacksonville , Florida , USA This is a very interesting article . \nIt is a classic philosophy question that can never be convincingly answered . \nThis article lists some interesting points . \nIn one part , there is the argument that why ca n't god just create good people with free will ? \nIf god just created good people with free will , it logically follows that all their actions will always be good since they are good people . \nDoes n't this defeat the whole purpose of free will where you can choose your actions as opposed to being restricted only to good actions ? \nIt almost feels like an oxymoron to say that we should only have good people with free will . \nSecondly , in vedic philosophy there is a belief in the continuum of the soul . \nMany scientific studies and real world experiences show that this could be true . \nTo believe or not is a question for another day . \nHowever , if we allow for this continuum then we can easily explain natural disasters -LRB- where even innocent babies die -RRB- by attributing the punishment to their past lives ' actions , also known as Sanchita Karma in Sanskrit . \nThe other answer to the question posed could just be that god 's ways are so intricate and complex that to comprehend the greater good out of seemingly painful punishments are just beyond human comprehension . \nThis is one of those questions that we could argue about all day and yet arrive at no answer . \nKRL , Old Bridge , New Jersey Having lost a sister to a brain tumor aged 49 , and a close friend to cancer at the age of 30 , and being a C of E priest , you might imagine this kind of matter has been a part of my own , and many others ' formation . \nArchbishop Sentamu is right on one level ; for the sake of those caught up in this tragedy we need to pray and act now , and think later . \nBut for many of us there has already been much thought . \nJohn Polkinghorne and others successfully argue that free will is not just about humanity , it is also about the freedom of the universe to be what it is . \nIt has to ` work ' to make sense . \nIn order for life to exist on this planet there simply has to be tectonic activity . \nWithout the ` recycling ' processes involved there would be insufficient carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and earth would become a lifeless snowball . \nIt has to be a dynamic system and given the freedom to be what it is . \nLikewise , without mutation there could be no progressive evolution . \nMost mutations are dead-ends , some are useful and retained if they provide breeding advantage , and some are deadly . \nBut you can not have one without another , at least not if you want life . \nCould God have done it differently ? \nBut then if his hand was that obvious , would we have the freedom to choose whether to seek him out ? \nBut back to Archbishop Sentamu 's sentiments ; the importance of what needs to be done now far outweighs the philosophy of why it happened . \n"}

the military will have their own comms . \nFor Haiti 's people , there will be very little to use to communicate with one another -LRB- lack of electricity , land lines , mobiles systems -RRB- and their vital need to talk to each other to confirm who is alive or dead will be frustrated . \nOrganisations such as Telephones without Frontiers will make a vital contribution in providing a limited access for users . \nAccording to Ian Hanson , Bournemouth University Centre for Forensics , a vital component of disaster management is identification of the dead and injured . \nThere is a danger that with the use of mass graves to remove rotting corpses , many people will never be identified . \nOn top of this , a significant number of people will never be found . \nMiddle and long term psychological stress disorders will be prevalent . \nGovernments will be demanding that their ambassadors in Haiti get out to find out where their own citizens are , says Mr Hanson . \nDisaster Victim Identification -LRB- DVI -RRB- requires the careful collection of post-mortem data from a body and then matching it to existing ante-mortem data . \nIn the case of international citizens in Haiti such ante-mortem data will include dental records , X-rays , fingerprints , and possibly facial recognition . \nDVI activity after the Indonesian tsunami in 2005 revealed that some 80 % of positive IDs were from finger prints or odontology or a combination of the two . \nKenyon International and other established organizations are deploying to Haiti to assist in this . \nA body lies among the debris For Haitians , there is likely to be an almost total lack of ante-mortem data because standard dental or fingerprint records may not exist . \nVisual records and identification will be their best chance , however this will become impossible if bodies are left too long before being recovered . \nThe cost of excavating collapsed buildings for the Haitians with limited equipment is also prohibitive in the recovery of bodies , as is the cost of putting a body through an identification process . \nMany Haitians may never be identified but memorialised in some way . \nThis is part of the reflection of the cost , political will , resources and technical skills available for poorer nations versus rich nations . \nAs with other areas of disaster preparedness and response , there is a gap between who gets identified , if they can be , and where they are from . \nSecurity is always a big issue in managing disasters . \nThe maintenance of public order is a national responsibility . \nIf , or when , the problems exceed the police capacity to handle them - which is probably already the case in Haiti - then the military are normally called in . \nThe Haitian police and military will both have suffered significant casualties - as has the already weak government . \nThere is a very high risk that , unless aid gets through much faster to the needy , there will probably be a major breakdown in law and order . \nThis could raise very serious issues with foreign national forces - the US in particular - who are armed and who may be forced to use arms to protect themselves . \nUN soldiers patrol the ruined streets of Port-au-Prince Security of routes is essential , as it is roads that become the essential lifelines for logistical support and the movement of essential relief to where it is needed . \nRoads are being blocked at present and it appears that the police are unable to deploy in sufficient strength to maintain route security . \nAs a result , the development of a co-ordinated security plan that uses local police as well as US military and UN troops will need careful co-ordination and agreed rules of engagement for outbreaks of public disorder . \nSupply trucks from the Dominican Republic arrive in Haiti Haiti has a land border with the Dominican Republic . \nDisaster management planning includes the prior agreement of cross-border co-operation protocols to ensure that assistance is not stockpiled at the border unable to cross over owing to import\\/export regulations which have not been previously sorted . \nTwo key lessons will apply - among others , but these are the two most important : Survivors want to stay close to where they lived - to be moved into camps is not a favored option for survivors but it is often the selected option for governments because control is much easier . \nA very difficult decision will be reached in the next few days - when to stop trying to find live bodies and to bring in heavy machinery to clear rubble . \nTrapped victims dehydrate and die after about four-to-seven days , sooner if seriously injured . \nPossibly also worth noting that studies into previous earthquakes indicate that epidemics are not the great threat that media often make them out to be . \nGood quality water is a key . \n"}

'' \nThe story is the same elsewhere in the city , with other medical organizations reporting that the majority of operations are ending with amputations . \n`` There is gangrene everywhere and you amputate on the go , '' said Hans Van Dillen of Medecins Sans Frontieres -LRB- MSF -RRB- . \n`` You conduct radical surgery . \nThere 's nothing more you can do . '' \nIn the immediate aftermath of an earthquake , it may be necessary for doctors to carry out a field amputation to extricate a victim from the rubble of a collapsed building or to remove a hopelessly mangled limb . \nThere is an avalanche of patients and almost all of them come in with traumatic injuries The procedure is considered one of last resort , however , and the vast majority of amputations are carried out later in medical facilities after all attempts to spare a severely injured limb have failed , and to prevent loss of blood and infection . \nBut in areas where destruction is severe , infrastructure is poor , or there is a widespread lack of available medical care - such as Haiti - even minor injuries to limbs can become life-threatening within days and require amputations . \n`` You always have a big wave of amputations from around the third day , for about a week afterwards . \nThen the demand for such surgery becomes less intense , '' Susan Wright , the director of Medecins du Monde UK , told the BBC . \n`` There is a hope that it will shift in the coming week . '' \nMs Wright says the longer a person is trapped under rubble or does not receive treatment for their injuries , the more likely it is that they will suffer from crush syndrome - a serious condition resulting from damage to large areas of muscle - or shock , blood loss , dehydration , hypothermia and a weakened immune system . \nDoctors frequently amputate infected limbs to prevent the onset of sepsis All of these will reduce the body 's ability to cope with injuries to limbs and to maintain the blood supply . \nIf starved of blood and oxygen , cells and tissues will die , become more vulnerable to infection and may require amputation . \nAs time passes , the risk of developing a serious infection in a limb directly from even minor injuries such as cuts and grazes also becomes more acute . \nWithout antibiotics , a person can develop gangrene or blood poisoning , which if untreated can eventually lead to sepsis , the body 's inflammatory response to an infection , and death . \nDoctors frequently amputate seriously infected limbs in a last-ditch effort to prevent the onset of sepsis - an all too frequent occurrence in Haiti at present . \n`` We have had to perform dozens of amputations , including many double amputations . \nThe problem is people have n't gotten medical care soon enough , so wounds are very infected . \nSome of them are coming in with bones just sticking out from the rest of the leg , '' said Dr Diana Lardy of the International Medical Corps . \nUnder normal circumstances , a patient undergoing an amputation would be anaesthetised , and the bone would be sawn through with an oscillating saw . \nThe procedure would be carried out in a sterile theater to prevent infection . \nI did my first amputation with three forceps , five scissors and a scalpel , without water , and just a flashlight to illuminate the injury But surgeons in Haiti say they have had to carry out dozens of amputations in unsterile conditions , without electricity or even the correct equipment . \nDr Lorblanches , who worked in Iran after a massive earthquake struck the city of Bam in late 2003 , said Haiti was the worst disaster he had ever seen . \n`` I have never seen anything like this - infected wounds full of larvae , '' he said . \n`` I did my first amputation with three forceps , five scissors and a scalpel , without water , and just a flashlight to illuminate the injury . '' \nCuban medic Dr Olga Maria Delgado said she and her colleagues had performed more than 40 amputations on a tiled counter inside a tin-roofed building within the grounds of the Renaissance Hospital in Port-au-Prince . \nSterility was less of an issue than normal , because most of the wounds were already infected , she added . \n`` There is an avalanche of patients and almost all of them come in with traumatic injuries , '' Dr Delgado said . \nMs Wright said MDM 's clinics were also being inundated as more people were rescued and others found out where treatment was available , with more than a hundred people waiting for surgery . \n`` Every time we look out of the window , there 's a queue around the block , '' she said . \nBut even once they have lost a limb , the lack of sterile equipment and antibiotics mean the new amputees face a struggle to stay alive . \n"}

'' \nMs Napolitano did not say how many Haitian children might be involved . \nUS Secretary of State Hillary Clinton earlier told CNN she was `` personally directing that we do everything we can to try to find and identify those children who are already adoptable ... and to try to expedite all the paperwork ... to get them to their new home '' . \nCanadian authorities have also indicated that priority consideration in granting immigration visas would be given to pending adoption cases . \nIt is believed between 1,200 and 1,500 adoption cases are pending for French families , but the French government has said its priority is emergency aid rather than organising the transfer of the children . \n`` Adoptive families whose procedure in Haiti has been completed and whose child has a Haitian passport can rest assured that they will be brought to France as soon as possible , '' the French foreign ministry said . \nSpain 's foreign ministry said that it was `` taking all possible steps so that Haitian minors who have been adopted by Spanish families can travel to Spain given the special conditions affecting Haiti , '' according to the AFP news agency . \nThe ministry said it was currently holding meeting with families which had completed adoptions . \nHowever , some adoptive parents are pressing for more urgent action given the humanitarian situation in Haiti . \nBringing children into the US either by airlift or new adoption during a time of national emergency can open the door for fraud , abuse and trafficking Joint Council on International Children 's Services They are also concerned that many records , which will often have taken months to finalize , may have been lost amid the earthquake damage . \nThe Roman Catholic archdiocese in Miami , which has a sizeable Haitian community , has proposed the airlift of hundreds of Haitian children to South Florida , in an echo of the exodus from Cuba in the early 1960 of some 14,000 Cuban youngsters . \nHowever , the Joint Council on International Children 's Services , a US advocacy group , says the immediate focus should be on the safety of children in Haiti and getting emergency help to them . \n`` While both airlifts and new adoptions are based on valid concerns and come from an obviously loving heart , neither option is considered viable by any credible child welfare organization , '' the group said . \n`` Bringing children into the US either by airlift or new adoption during a time of national emergency can open the door for fraud , abuse and trafficking .

'' \nThe charity has its own guidelines on cadaver management for disaster zones and signs up to 2009 advice from the Pan American branch of the World Health Organisations - Management of Dead Bodies After Disasters : A Field Manual for First Responders . \nThe guide was compiled after numerous disasters - the 2004 Asian Tsunami , Haiti 's 2004 floods , Hurricanes Katrina and Stan and the Northern Pakistan and Indian earthquakes - highlighted an absence of advice on what to do and why . \nIt came after research by Oliver Morgan , at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine , that found dead bodies in natural disasters do not pose a public health threat . \nThe guide sets out how ordinary people helping on the ground can manage the recovery , identification , storage and disposal of the dead . \nAnd how to help families come to terms with it . \nIf necessary , temporary burial is recommended , but the caustic chemicals used to try to `` disinfect '' bodies are not - they have no effect and make identification harder . \nBodies pile up in the streets Indeed , the guide says it is the `` surviving population '' that is `` much more likely '' to be a source of infection than the dead . \nBut care does need to be taken in handling dead bodies , says Dr Egbert Sondorp , senior lecturer in public health and humanitarian aid at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine . \n`` At the time of their death , people are likely to be healthy . \nYou need to take care in handling them , precautions , as you do n't know . \nBut they are not in themselves a risk . '' \nThose clearing dead bodies have to take basic safeguards like wearing gloves and hand-washing . \nThese help protect against a range of diseases which can linger in the dead for two days - tuberculosis , Hepatitis B and C , diarrhoeal diseases . \nAnd HIV , which can last for six . \nThere are also risks in drinking water contaminated with faeces from the living and the dead . \nA regular part of the BBC News Magazine , Who , What , Why ? \naims to answer some of the questions behind the headlines So why are people buried so quickly , if the official guidance suggests they should not be ? \nOne reason is the smell , says Dr Sondorp . \n`` A body which is decaying smells . \nIn most communities you try to get that away , as psychologically it 's awful to have them around . \nYou want to stop dogs -LRB- and vermin -RRB- eating them , as that too is psychologically awful . '' \nAlso , there has been no-one on the ground in Haiti to say otherwise . \nGovernmental and non-governmental organization has been absent . \nTradition also plays a part - religions including Islam and Judaism like to see their dead buried within 24 hours . \nThe deep-seated fear of disease emanating from dead bodies could also stem from epidemics of the past , where people died in their droves from cholera . \nAnd mass burial plots are dug outside graveyards But earthquakes , floods and fires involve deaths from drowning , injury and burns , not disease . \nDespite the human instinct to get rid of the bodies quickly , a more considered approach can have long-term benefits for the mental health of the bereaved , says Ute Hofmeister , forensic adviser at the International Committee of the Red Cross . \n`` In all disasters , that 's the human instinct , because the bodies start to smell really bad , look bad and it 's not very dignified having them hanging around in the street . \n`` But experience shows for people , even in natural disasters , it 's important to know what 's happened to their dead . \nIt helps them very much to know where they 're buried . '' \nThere are also practical implications . \nCorrect identification of the dead has legal significance for inheritance and insurance that can affect families for many years . \n"}

'' \nHe said he had passed out in the rubble , and that he had heard his mother 's cries in his dreams . \nHe had had a little space around him when the furniture in his room collapsed , but he had not had any food . \nHe had drunk his own urine to keep thirst at bay . \n`` I am here today because God wants it , '' he said . \nMarie Carida was found severely dehydrated after 10 days in the rubble . \nThe 84-year-old woman is being treated by doctors at the main city hospital , where she is in a critical condition . \n`` I 'm trying to find out how I can help her survive , '' Dr Ernest Benjamin said . \n`` It 's worth everything to try to save her . '' \nHer son said he had heard her cries on Thursday morning and , almost a day later , he dug her out with the help of friends . \nMENDJI BAHINA SANON , 11-YEAR-OLD GIRL Mendji Bahina Sanon was pulled out after spending eight days buried under Haiti 's rubble . \nOne of five children - four of whom survived the earthquake - she was rescued after being trapped beneath the remains of her home in the capital , Port-au-Prince . \nMendji asked for cornflakes after being pulled out after eight days `` I had left my five children at home . \nThe two-storey building had collapsed . \nI thought they were all dead , '' said her mother , a cleaner for the UN , describing the hours after the earthquake struck . \nHelped by her neighbors , she continued to search for her missing daughter even after finding the body of the young girl 's five-year-old brother . \nOn Wednesday , she described hearing a neighbor cry out : `` I heard your daughter , she called out . '' \n`` I did n't believe it , but I rushed , the neighbors dug , she was alive and they dug her out . \nShe talked to me and asked me for milk and cornflakes and then she fainted . '' \nBeing treated in hospital , doctors say she is regaining strength and doing well though she is troubled by nightmares , begging her mother not to `` leave her in the hole '' . \nThe surgeon treating her at a French field hospital described her survival as as `` a miracle '' . \n`` She came back to life bit by bit . \nShe is blessed by the gods , '' said Dominique Jean . \nLOZAMA HOTTELINE , 25 , SUPERMARKET Rescue workers said it was remarkable Ms Hotteline was found alive Ms Hotteline had been in an apartment over a supermarket in Port-au-Prince when it collapsed . \nAfter seven days in the rubble with no food or water , she was finally pulled out by Turkish , French and Haitian teams . \nOne rescue worker said it was a miracle they had been able to save her . \nVideo footage showed Ms Hotteline smiling and chatting to the rescuers as they carried her away on a stretcher at around midnight . \n`` We pulled someone out seven days after an earthquake - that is quite extraordinary , '' said Bruno Besson of French group Rescuers Without Borders , which co-ordinated the effort . \nELISABETH JOASSAINT , ABOUT 15 DAYS OLD , JACMEL The tiny baby 's parents had given up hope that she was alive after their house collapsed with her on the upper floor , French media reported . \nWorkers were in the process of demolishing what remained of the building in Jacmel when they found her . \nBy the time she was rescued , uninjured , on 19 January , she had spent half her life trapped in rubble . \n`` This was n't the way Jesus wanted the baby to die , '' her grandfather , Michelet Joassaint , was quoted by the Times as saying . \n`` Everybody knew the baby was dead , except the Lord . '' \nENA ZIZI , 69 , CATHOLIC CHURCH Ms Zizi said she had been praying constantly while lying in the rubble Mexican and South African rescue teams pulled Ena Zizi out of the rubble almost exactly one week after the quake struck . \nShe had been attending a church meeting in the home of Haiti 's Roman Catholic archbishop , when it collapsed around her . \n`` We kept working until I could reach the woman and I felt she grabbed my hand and squeezed it strongly and I felt that God had touched my hand , '' said one of the Mexican rescuers . \n`` I could kiss the hand and she called me ` son ' . '' \nMs Zizi was dehydrated and had a dislocated hip and broken leg but sang as she was carried away on a stretcher . \nShe said her faith had kept her going and she had prayed constantly during her ordeal . \nHer son Joseph said it was a miracle she had survived . \nThe little girl was covered in dust , but otherwise healthy Nurses at Port-au-Prince 's main hospital greeted a baby girl with loud applause on Monday , after she survived six days buried under the rubble of her home , the AFP news agency reports . \n`` This is incredible , she has no injuries , '' said a nurse as she gave the child water and carefully washed off the dust that covered her small body from head to toe . \nThe girl is thought to be about 18 months . \nHer name is not known and her family are thought to have been killed in the quake . \nShe is the second baby to be unearthed in Haiti in as many days . \nMedics at an Israeli field hospital outside the capital treated Jean-Louis Brahms , eight months old , who was rescued after spending five days trapped under what used to be his house . \nBaby Jean-Louis was close to death when a neighbor heard his cries and alerted rescuers and his parents - who had given up hope of finding him alive . \nRescue teams labored for 12 hours to save Marie-France French and US rescue crews worked late into the night on Sunday to rescue 22-year-old Marie-France , who was trapped behind a steel door in the rubble of a collapsed row of shops . \nThe teams broke about a dozen saws as they cut their way through the double-reinforced steel door . \nAt one point , they lowered a doctor - dangling by his feet - into the narrow tunnel they had cut , to attend to the young woman . \nUnfortunately , her arm - trapped under a concrete beam - had to be amputated before they could extract her . \nA Peruvian team managed to pull Maxine Fallon from the remains of a flattened school on Sunday . \nThe UN and the host country decide when to call off the searches for those trapped , and to focus instead on looking after the survivors . \nThe average time for this switch is between five and seven days . \nIndividuals have been known to survive up to 13 days trapped if they have access to water . \nMs Fallon said she had prayed fiercely for someone to find her . \n`` I had hoped I would be rescued , '' she told CNN . \nReporters said she was drifting in and out of consciousness when she was freed . \nRescuers went to the scene after buried survivors begged for help via text messages . \nIt is unclear if the messages came from Ms Fallon , or if others were still waiting to be rescued nearby . \nRick Santos , a 47-year-old aid worker , said he felt `` moments of just joy '' after being pulled from the debris of the Montana hotel on Friday , some 50 hours after he and four colleagues were buried there . \nHe told the BBC they spent three `` very dark nights '' trapped in the dust and darkness , with only one lollipop - which they passed around . \nMr Santos , who heads IMA World Health , said he `` ca n't begin to describe '' how he felt after he was rescued by French firefighters . \n`` I looked up and saw stars and that was amazing . \nThen I called my wife and said ` Sweetie , I 'm out ' - and she said , ' I know , I saw you come out on TV ' , '' Mr Santos told the BBC World Service . \nAlso rescued along with Mr Santos was Sarla Chand , a 65-year-old physician from New Jersey . \nBut two of their colleagues were not so lucky - they later died of their injuries . \n`` I want to remember them , '' said Mr Santos . \n`` A lot of people died and we are praying for them too . '' \nNAZER AND FRANGINA , CHILDREN IN DELMAS The moment six-year-old Nazer Erne emerged in the arms of a rescuer On Sunday , five days after the quake hit , American rescuers managed to save two children trapped under the rubble of a collapsed home in Port-au-Prince 's Delmas neighborhood . \nA six-year-old boy , Nazer Erne , was pulled out first , looking gaunt and covered in dust . \nBut he smiled to the paramedics from his stretcher , saying he felt fine . \nMedics say he had chipped his tooth . \nSoon after Nazer , the team from South Florida pulled out a 14-year-old girl , named Frangina . \nAs she was carried away by medics , she cried out that a third child buried in the house along with them had died . \nJENS KRISTENSEN , DANISH UN WORKER Jens Kristensen emerged without a scratch on him Also on Sunday , crews rescued the UN 's Danish civil affairs officer , Jens Kristensen , who was found fully conscious under the wreckage of its five-storey headquarters in Port-au-Prince . \n`` It 's a miracle really that he has been drawn out , alive and no damage at all to his body , '' his mother , Hanne Tranum Kristensen , told the BBC 's World Today program from Denmark . \nMore than 300 UN employees are missing - many still buried in the rubble of four UN facilities around Port-au-Prince . \nFrances Gilles managed to call a relative on his mobile phone An Israeli rescue team managed to cut a small tunnel through the ruins of the national tax office to save its administrative director . \nFrances Gilles , 59 , was freed after eight hours of painstaking and dangerous effort . \nHe said he had heard voices and cars for days , but had lost the strength to shout . \n`` I think I am privileged and my rescue is like a miracle because at one time I thought I would be abandoned , '' he told the BBC . \nMr Gilles had managed to call a relative from his mobile phone , giving his exact location . \nA seven-year-old girl survived more than four days in a supermarket that collapsed around her , the New York Times reported . \nRescuers said they heard a small voice from deep in a pile of rubble at the Caribbean Supermarket in the Delmas neighborhood late on Saturday . \nAmerican and Turkish rescue workers then reached the girl , who said she had made it through with hope and by snacking on the supermarket 's dried fruit rolls . \nUK firefighters pulled two-year-old Haitian girl Mia from the rubble where she had been trapped for three days . \nOfficers from the city of Manchester said the operation was `` lengthy and difficult '' in Haiti 's searing heat . \nShe was trapped beneath piles of rubble when her kindergarten totally collapsed . \nChief Officer Mike Thomas said : `` This is what we do the job for . \nThe conditions we are working in are pretty dire . \nThis is a real bonus to us all . '' \nMia 's rescue came a few hours after Spanish rescuers pulled another two-year-old child , Redjeson Hausteen Claude , from the rubble . \nCovered with dust , he seemed to smile as he was reunited with his mother . \nTARMO JOVEER , ESTONIAN UN PROTECTION OFFICER Many of the thousands of UN peacekeepers , diplomats and development experts who live and work in Haiti were among those affected by the earthquake . \nAt least 100 are still missing . \nTarmo Joveer was given water via a rubber tube On Thursday US Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the tale of one UN staff member found beneath the rubble of the international body 's collapsed headquarters in Port-au-Prince . \nEstonian protection officer Tarmo Joveer , Mr Ban said , was only found after `` scratching sounds '' were heard and was kept alive by being `` given water through a rubber pipe '' . \nHe was eventually rescued from where he was trapped , beneath some 4m -LRB- 12ft -RRB- of rubble . \n`` It was a small , small miracle during a night which brought few other miracles , '' he said , adding that Mr Joveer had been taken to a hospital in Argentina for treatment . \nJILLIAN THORP , US AID WORKER , AND HER HUSBAND , FRANK Frank Thorp , a US citizen in Haiti , says he drove about 100 miles -LRB- 160km -RRB- to Port-au-Prince immediately after Tuesday 's earthquake to rescue his 23-year-old wife Jillian , an aid worker . \nJillian Thorp was trapped underneath about a foot of concrete `` I 'd spoken to her on Skype for about 10 seconds , she said that she was trapped . \nAnd that 's all that I knew . \nIt was absolutely terrifying , '' Mr Thorp told CBS 's Early Show . \nMr Thorp says that their entire house - a three-storey concrete building - had collapsed and Jillian and one other person were trapped under 30cm -LRB- 12in -RRB- of concrete . \nWe had to plough bricks and bricks and bricks ... and doors and metal away for at least an hour before we were able to get her and her co-worker out `` I jumped into the hole and I was able to see her wave her hand ; I could n't see her whole body ... I could hear her voice ... '' He said his wife was saying : `` Just get me out of here ! '' \n`` We had to plough bricks and bricks and bricks ... and doors and metal away for at least an hour before we were able to get her and her co-worker out , '' he said . \n"}

'' \nMSF has begun some emergency surgery at Choscal Hospital in Cite Soleil , a slum area where tin-roofed shacks survived better in the quake than the concrete structures in other parts of the city . \nThe `` Doctors Without Borders '' charity has also found another site that it hopes to have up and running as an operating block this weekend . \nThe ICRC and Save the Children , both of which have worked in Haiti for many years , have been distributing medical supplies to hospitals and clinics . \nDifficulties getting aid in and out of the capital 's overwhelmed airport prompted a Red Cross medical convoy delivery by road on Saturday from the Dominican Republic . \nThe convoy transported a 50-bed field hospital , surgical teams and an emergency telecoms unit , and the Red Cross says it is planning the delivery of two larger field hospitals . \nAn ICRC flight carrying 40 tonnes of medical supplies that had been due to arrive on Friday was diverted to the Dominican Republic , and is due to reach Port-au-Prince overland on Sunday . \nMany are wearing facemasks to protect themselves from the smell of decaying bodies International Committee of the Red Cross Care International , whose work in Haiti dates back to the aftermath of Hurricane Hazel in 1954 , has identified water and food provision as its top priority in the earthquake 's aftermath . \nIt has shipped 600,000 water purification sachets to Haiti from Panama and plans distribution of 60,000 meals of high-energy biscuits . \nAnother immediate need is supply of body bags , according to project manager Joseph Francoeur Jean in the nearby city of Gonaives , who called the disaster `` Haiti 's darkest day '' . \nThe Haitian government says it has collected 50,000 bodies , although there are fears the death toll could rise to between 100,000 and 200,000 . \nThe day after the earthquake , the ICRC activated a special website to enable people affected by the disaster to get in touch with loved ones . \nOf almost 20,000 registered on the site by Saturday , only about 1,400 of those were people inside Haiti letting others know they were safe and well . \nThe ICRC 's Simon Schorno , in Port-au-Prince , said there were about 40 makeshift camps covering every open public space in the city . \n`` It 's utter chaos - there is destruction in every neighborhood , '' he said . \n`` People are walking around , looking for food , for help . \nMany are wearing facemasks to protect themselves from the smell of decaying bodies . \nThere are no tents , no plastic sheeting , no place to cook and no toilets . '' \nTens of thousands are in camps , afraid to return to damaged buildings Save the Children said it had been assessing health needs in the temporary camps set up in the worst-hit neighborhoods . \nOn the charity 's website , emergency team leader Annie Foster described `` dazed , dehydrated parents walking the streets with their children , searching for clean water , food , and shelter '' . \nShe said the charity was establishing '' ` safe space ' areas for children in these camps , and also beginning child tracing programs to reconnect children who were separated from their families during the emergency '' . \nSave the Children 's other work includes : Mounting a staging ground in the Dominican Republic , from where overland delivery has begun of household and hygiene supplies including blankets , soap and jerrycans Sending additional emergency staff to Port-au-Prince , including specialist support on education , livelihoods and child protection needs Eleven ICRC emergency experts have already flown from Geneva , Switzerland , and are on the ground in Port-au-Prince assessing humanitarian needs . \nAnother specialist team is due to fly out on Sunday , ahead of 14 Emergency Response Units -LRB- ERUs -RRB- from Red Cross Societies around the world due to arrive in the coming days . \nThese ERUs will offer medical care , water and sanitation services , as well as setting up two `` base camps '' to provide logistical and technical support to the relief effort . \n"}

'' \nThere is little police presence in the capital , although some Brazilian UN peacekeepers are patrolling the streets . \nUN Undersecretary General for Peacekeeping Alain Le Roy told the US Public Broadcasting Service -LRB- PBS -RRB- network on Friday : `` There have been some incidents where people were looting or fighting for food . \nThey are desperate . '' \nBut he added that overall the situation remained under control so far . \nThe BBC 's Nick Davis in Port-au-Prince says the only convoys he has seen are people leaving the city , in search of food , water and medicine . \n` Historic effort needed in Haiti ' The UN is reporting a rise in the number of people trying to cross into the neighbouring Dominican Republic , and an influx into Haiti 's northern cities . \nOvernight the crippled port received its first supply ship since the earthquake , a boat carrying bananas and coal , AFP reports . \nInterior Minister Paul Antoine Bien-Aime said 50,000 bodies had been collected , but the total number of dead could be `` between 100,000 and 200,000 '' . \nThe UN said about 300,000 people had been made homeless . \nUS authorities have taken temporary control of the airport to help distribute aid more quickly . \nMeanwhile , details are emerging about the extent of the damage beyond Port-au-Prince . \nUp to 90 % of the buildings have been damaged in Leogane , a town about 19km -LRB- 18 miles -RRB- to the west , the UN said . \n`` According to the local police , between 5,000 to 10,000 people have been killed and most bodies are still in the collapsed buildings , '' Elisabeth Byrs said . \nThe UN has launched an appeal for $ 562m -LRB- # 346m -RRB- intended to help three million people for six months . \nA total of about $ 360m has been pledged so far for the relief effort , but only part of this sum will be included in the emergency appeal . \nUN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon , who is due to visit Haiti on Sunday , said distribution of food and medicine was under way . \nThe US has already sent an aircraft carrier , the USS Carl Vinson , to Haiti and the USS Bataan , carrying a marine expeditionary unit , is on its way . \nA hospital ship and more helicopters are due to be sent in the coming days , carrying more troops and marines , with the total number of US troops to rise to between 9,000 and 10,000 . \nAid groups say it is a race against time to find any more trapped survivors . \nPlane-loads of rescuers and relief supplies have arrived or are due from the UK , China , the EU , Canada , Russia and Latin American nations . \n"}

's devastating earthquake in Haiti . \nUN humanitarian chief John Holmes said the funds were intended to help three million people for six months . \nThe earthquake has left tens of thousands of people dead , and rescuers are continuing an increasingly desperate search for survivors . \nMeanwhile , US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she would travel to Haiti on Saturday . \nThe BBC 's Matthew Price , outside the ruins of a nursing college in the capital Port-au-Prince , says he has been told by a female member of staff that there could be 260 dead bodies and up to 25 people still alive under the rubble . \nBehind me is what remains of a five-storey building , a college of nursing that is now the size of a one-storey building . \nAccording to one of the members of management here , inside there were believed to have been more than 200 people who were crushed when that building came down . \nIt is also believed that there are possibly 25 people alive in there . \nThe reason for believing that is that last night a text message was received from someone who said they were inside , that they were very hungry , that they were very hot indeed and that they needed someone to come and rescue them . \nIn the last few hours a Brazilian search and rescue team has been very , very slowly trying to get access inside . \nTheir truck has now started moving away . \nA team of Brazilian rescuers is trying to gain access to the victims but progress is painfully slow , our correspondent adds . \nHaitian Interior Minister Paul Antoine Bien-Aime told Reuters news agency that 50,000 bodies had already been collected . \n`` We anticipate there will be between 100,000 and 200,000 dead in total , although we will never know the exact number , '' he said . \nThe Pan American Health Organization has estimated that the death toll could be as high as 100,000 , while the UN said about 300,000 had been made homeless . \nThe US has announced it will grant leave to remain to thousands of illegal Haitian migrants living there due to the humanitarian crisis in their country . \nThe chief of the homeland security department , Janet Napolitano , said they would be allowed to stay and work , initially for 18 months . \nAid workers have been grappling with logistical problems as they attempt to distribute aid . \nThe port is too damaged to use and roads are blocked by debris , although the main route from the Dominican Republic is now clear . \nThis is a huge and a horrifying catastrophe , the full consequences of which we do not know Correspondents say survivors seem increasingly desperate and angry as bottlenecks and infrastructure damage delay relief efforts . \nMr Holmes , who heads the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs -LRB- Ocha -RRB- , said a massive effort was being mounted and officials were `` straining every nerve '' to help . \n`` This is a huge and a horrifying catastrophe , the full consequences of which we do not know , '' he said . \nHe said almost half of the appeal money would be for emergency food aid , with amounts of between $ 20m and $ 50m for health , water and sanitation , nutrition , emergency shelter , early recovery and agriculture . \nMr Holmes earlier told reporters that 30 % of buildings throughout Port-au-Prince had been damaged , with the figure at 50 % in some areas . \nMany there have spent a third day without food and shelter in the ruined capital , though UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon , who is due to visit Haiti on Sunday , said distribution of food and medicine was under way . \nThe BBC 's Nick Davis in Port-au-Prince says the only convoys he has seen are people leaving the city , in search of food , water and medicine . \nCorrespondents say there is little official presence in Port-au-Prince despite incidents of looting . \nMrs Clinton said she would visit Haiti on Saturday to assess the damage , meet government officials and convey to the Haitian people `` our long term , unwavering support , solidarity and sympathies '' . \nEarlier US President Barack Obama described the scale of the devastation as extraordinary and the losses suffered as `` heartbreaking '' . \nIn a statement at the White House , he said the US would `` do what it takes to save lives and help people get back on their feet '' . \nThe US has already sent an aircraft carrier , the USS Carl Vinson , to Haiti and the USS Bataan , carrying a marine expeditionary unit , is on its way . \nA hospital ship and more helicopters are due to be sent in the coming days , carrying more troops and marines , with the total number of US troops to rise to between 9,000 and 10,000 . \nAid groups say it is a race against time to find trapped survivors . \nPlane-loads of rescuers and relief supplies have arrived or are due from the UK , China , the EU , Canada , Russia and Latin American nations . \nGen Douglas Fraser , the commander of US Southcom , says around 90 aid flights a day are

'' \nIt was unclear exactly how many Britons remained unaccounted for in Haiti . \nThe Foreign Office said 30 had been found safe and well , although one UK woman - Ann Barnes , originally from Leigh-on-Sea in Essex - is known to be missing . \nThe 59-year-old personal assistant to the UN police commissioner in Haiti has not been heard of since the UN 's headquarters collapsed on Tuesday . \nThe Disasters Emergency Committee is co-ordinating an appeal to help the people of Haiti There are 13 charities involved including the British Red Cross , Islamic Relief and World Vision Donate via the DEC website or by telephoning 0370 60 60 900 A 71-strong British search-and-rescue team has flown to the region , and includes a number of firefighters and two search dogs . \nThey found a two-year-old girl alive in the rubble of a nursery . \nAnd they rescued a man aged 55 from a collapsed supermarket and a 39-year-old woman who had been in a block of flats . \nMeanwhile the organization United Haitians in the UK asked for donations of clothes , medicine and money . \nIt held a meeting in London attended by some of those whose relatives were missing or displaced . \n`` I 've been calling , trying to call on the internet and in e-mails , and I 've got nowhere , '' said Nadege Attis , whose boyfriend is missing . \n`` I 've decided it 's better for me to go there , and find any ways I can to go there , '' she told BBC News . \n`` I ca n't keep waiting .

'' \nThe Red Cross was also mobilising stocks of plastic sheets , tarpaulins , hygiene kits , mosquito nets and buckets from Panama , he said . \nLooking further ahead , he said : `` Emergency relief typically takes 6-8 weeks , with recovery 2-4 years . \n`` Normally the response moves from search and rescue and medical needs , to helping those who have lost homes with shelter , to water sanitation and food . \nThen comes more longer-term recovery programs , like re-building homes and offering families micro-loans . '' \nOxfam , which had a member of staff killed in the earthquake , said its priority was `` always '' water and sanitation . \nThe charity is preparing to send up to 10 tonnes of water , sanitation , health and shelter equipment - valued at around # 70,000 - from its Oxford UK warehouse on Saturday afternoon . \nEquipment includes emergency sheeting for shelter and latrines , water tubing to create pipes , water purification chemicals and tablets and buckets to enable people to carry and store water . \nLarge parts of the Haitian capital have been devastated The charity said staff already based in Haiti had been providing shovels to clear rubble and search for trapped victims , and 17 international humanitarian experts had arrived in Haiti on Friday . \nKate Akhtar , senior emergency program officer for Care International , agreed that water and sanitation were `` key '' . \nShe said Care was sending 600,000 water purification tablets and it had enough stocks of high protein biscuits to feed 60,000 families . \nBut she said assessments needed to be `` ongoing '' . \nHaiti was `` well versed '' in disaster , having had four hurricanes in 2008 , but was in `` urgent need '' of more aid , she said . \n`` Urban areas are always difficult , but there is so much deforestation in Haiti - which has caused landslide problems in the past - that it will be difficult to source items to create shelter . '' \nCommunication was also a problem , with text messaging the only way to communicate with their staff , she said . \nActionAid said aid was `` trickling in '' but the situation was `` chaotic '' . \nIt said it had 25 staff in the country , but 20 were `` still trying to dig their families out of the rubble '' . \nA team of international staff from ActionAid , including some from the UK and Brazil , were traveling to Haiti and should be in the country by Sunday . \nAs well as delivering shelter , food and sanitary kits for women , the charity would provide psycho-social support , a spokeswoman said . \nPeter Grant , International Director of Tearfund , said the DEC considered three factors when it decided whether to launch an appeal : firstly , the need ; secondly , members ' capacity to respond ; and thirdly , evidence the UK public wanted to help . \nHe said the disaster in Haiti was `` clear cut '' because `` all lights were green '' - whereas in other scenarios , like the droughts in east Africa , it was much harder because `` there was little media interest '' . \nHe said Tearfund - which works with a range of churches and organizations in 35 countries - was sending a disaster assessment team to Haiti over the weekend with a view to helping in the medium - to long-term , but was already working with partners on the ground . \n`` By appealing in consortium , the DEC is flexible . \nDifferent agencies have different skills , so we work in a complementary way . \nSome agencies are geared up to send immediate relief - we anticipate a two-year response , '' he said . \n"}

{"id": "253", "time": "2010-01-29", "text": "Government and international officials in Haiti are drawing up a strategy to help rebuild the long-impoverished country , while continuing to provide emergency aid to the hundreds of thousands survivors left homeless . \nWe look at the short and long-term priorities . \nThe UN World Food Programme -LRB- WFP -RRB- has warned that while the relief effort in Haiti is beginning to gain its footing , providing food for more than two million people a day represents the most complex task it has ever faced . \nRelief agencies have tried to buy goods locally and regionally , but such efforts have been hampered because local markets affected by the earthquake have been slow to reopen , and Haiti 's subsistence farms have been unable to ramp up production . \nThis has forced the WFP to use nearly all of its stores of high-energy biscuits and nutrient-rich meals which do not require water . \nAid agencies will begin to distribute staple foods such as rice , beans , vegetable oil and salt - instead of just emergency ration packs - once cooking equipment has been distributed widely and safe water supplies have been established . \nThere is an acute shortage of drinking water in areas affected by the earthquake . \nThe water supply system , which before the disaster only provided 40 % of the population of Port-au-Prince with clean water , has effectively collapsed . \nMassive quantities of bottled water have had to be flown into Haiti Aid agencies are shipping in massive quantities of bottled water and distributing water purification tablets . \nMany people , however , have complained that they have received little , if any , of either . \nThe rapid response phase is expected to last two months and will need to be followed by longer-term activities , such as providing reliable water supplies for rebuilt homes and new settlements . \nThe main challenges are post-operative care and logistical support to the health facilities in terms of fuel and medical supplies , according to the UN humanitarian agency OCHA . \nHaiti 's ministry of health and the World Health Organization -LRB- WHO -RRB- is revising its emergency response strategy and will gradually shift the focus from emergency surgical cases to primary health care . \n`` Priorities are changing , and there is more need for post-operative care and follow-up . \nBut there is still little capacity to help patients who need that follow-up care , '' WHO Director Dr Mirta Roses said on 25 January . \nAmong the most urgent needs are those of thousands of Haitians who had amputations as a result of injuries . \n`` These people will need physical rehabilitation as well as mental health services . \nThat means more nursing and mental health personnel and more physical therapists , and of course the right equipment for these kinds of programs , '' said Dr Roses . \nAmong the most urgent cases are the thousands of Haitians who lost limbs Doctors fear many amputees will languish or even die without proper rehabilitation . \nAs the emergency phase of the disaster winds down , there is a pressing need for mobile and community-based clinics that can provide such services as maternity care , post-operative care , and treatment for chronic health problems including diabetes , heart disease , HIV , and tuberculosis , the WHO says . \nForty-three of the 59 hospitals , are now functioning , but they are having difficulty meeting the demand for health services , especially as the emergency medical personnel who arrived after the earthquake head home . \nAlso important is establishing surveillance networks to detect outbreaks of communicable diseases , a significant threat at the makeshift camps . \nThe International Organisation for Migration -LRB- IOM -RRB- says work is under way to improve the living conditions of the estimated 692,000 people in makeshift shelters in 591 camps in Port-au-Prince , until more durable solutions are found . \nMore than 235,000 people have taken advantage of the Haitian government 's offer of free transportation to cities in the north and south-west . \nThe IOM estimates that 100,000 family-sized tents are needed urgently Although the IOM had 10,000 tents stored in Haiti before the earthquake and has a further 30,000 abroad that will arrive soon , it says `` the supply is unlikely to address the extensive shelter needs '' . \nThe UN agency estimates that 100,000 family-sized tents are needed to house about 500,000 people , but the UN says up to one million require shelter . \nMeanwhile , work has begun at the sites identified by the Haitian government for the establishment of organised tented settlements . \nIt is estimated that each settlement will accommodate up to 10,000 people . \nHowever , tents can not be set up and displaced people relocated at the sites until they have water and sanitation facilities . \nTent settlements can only provide a short-term solution , officials say , particularly with the hurricane season expected to start around June . \nHaiti is likely to need billions of dollars to build new homes and government buildings in Port-au-Prince and the surrounding area , which were densely-populated before the earthquake . \nMany of the buildings that collapsed were poorly designed and built - mostly with concrete and often without steel reinforcement and foundations . \nThere is a clear need for higher technical standards to be used during reconstruction . \nMany of the buildings that collapsed were poorly designed and built But Haiti 's government , along with many planning and architectural experts , have also called for a new strategy that will help Haiti build for the future , including reducing Port-au-Prince 's population density and replacing slums on unstable hillsides with homes that are safe , affordable and sustainable . \nA new comprehensive building code that complies with international construction standards will be a priority . \nCletus Springer , the director of sustainable development at the Organisation of American States , said that for this to happen the authorities would have to work with the private sector and banks to help low-income families . \n`` Because of the poverty levels , not everybody 's going to be able to build to the exacting standards that a building code would require , '' he said . \nIn the short-term , the United Nations Human Settlements Programme -LRB- UN-Habitat -RRB- is carrying out a rapid structural damage estimate of buildings in the affected area . \nJean Yves Barcelo , the agency 's adviser in Haiti , hopes it will start planning for new settlements and at the neighborhood level within a week or two . \nExperts warn that desperate residents of the poorer areas of Port-au-Prince may begin informal and unregulated reconstruction before a long-term reconstruction plan can be instigated . \nThe lack of investment in Haiti 's rural economy over the past three decades has led to an average of 75,000 people moving to the capital , Port-au-Prince , every year . \nSince 1982 , the city 's population has grown from 750,000 to more than 2.5 million . \nThe rapid expansion was not planned and resulted in overcrowding , inadequate infrastructure , and the proliferation of slums containing scores of poorly-built homes , many of which were destroyed by the earthquake . \nHaiti 's ambassador to the US envisages a smaller , better-built Port-au-Prince Key official buildings - the presidential palace , parliament building , police headquarters and 13 of the government 's 15 ministries - were also destroyed . \nMany experts say that Port-au-Prince should be reduced in size when rebuilt , and Haiti 's economic and government activities decentralised . \nSome have even suggested relocating the capital altogether . \nHundreds of thousands of people have already left the city for tented settlements or family homes in other parts of Haiti . \nMany say they should be persuaded to stay . \nExperts warn , however , that mass-relocation schemes after other disasters have usually failed because they isolate people from the jobs and economic opportunity that drew them to the city in the first place . \nWhile the main airport in Port-au-Prince was not put out of action by the disaster , it was not equipped to deal with the volume of flights required by the relief effort . \nThe US military has taken over control of the airport To speed up the process , the US military took over control of the airport and 160 planes a day are currently able to land . \nAid flights are also coming into and out of the Dominican Republic and several other regional airports in Haiti . \nPort-au-Prince 's main port was also badly damaged and other ports in the area could only accept smaller vessels . \nOne of the two piers in the capital 's docks was recently reopened by the US Navy , allowing bulkier shipments to be delivered by sea . \nAt present , 150 containers can be unloaded a day . \nThe transportation of aid by road continues to be hampered by piles of rubble and the volume of people trying to move out of or around the capital . \nBut the UN Development Programme -LRB- UNDP -RRB- has begun employing local people to clear roads . \nTelephones and internet connections were down in many areas of Haiti for some time . \nThe situation has since improved , with emergency radios distributed and limited internet and phone capacity restored . \nExperts say large-scale capital investment , led by the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank , will be needed to bring the road , electricity , water and telephone systems up to standard , and rebuild Port-au-Prince 's seaport and airport . \nThere has been concern about the security situation in Haiti , with fears that people not receiving aid would turn to violence . \nUS troops have been tasked with some security responsibilities In a bid to boost security and assist the relief effort , the UN Security Council is increasing the UN stabilisation mission in Haiti -LRB- MINUSTAH -RRB- by 3,500 troops to 12,651 . \nBrazil plans to double its current contingent of 1,300 . \nThe EU is also deploying 150 officers of its new European Gendarmerie Force to assist the 3,500-strong UN police force , UNPOL , and the Haitian Police Force -LRB- HNP -RRB- , which has , so far , managed to get half of its 8,000 officers back on the streets . \nMeanwhile , the US has dispatched more than 15,000 military personnel to Haiti . \nAbout 4,700 are deployed on the ground with the rest on ships off the coast . \nThe UN and US military have also set up a Joint Operations Tasking Centre to co-ordinate security in and around Port-au-Prince . \nThe US ambassador to Haiti , Ken Merten , says the rebuilding efforts have to focus on creating jobs and attracting investment to Haiti . \nWithout it , those displaced will need income support or food aid to survive for the foreseeable future . \nThe UN Development Programme has said that as part of the rebuilding strategy , it aims to temporarily employ 220,000 Haitians to work clearing debris and restoring basic infrastructure . \nA long-term economic strategy prepared by the UN in 2009 that remains valid aimed to create 150,000 jobs over two years by harnessing Haiti 's advantages in clothing manufacturing , tourism and agriculture . \nInternational investors had launched a number of big projects before the earthquake and will be encouraged to stay . \nEconomists Paul Collier and Jean-Louis Warnholz , both of whom have experience in Haiti , say there is a need to relocate economic activity away from Port-au-Prince . \nThey propose that the construction of new homes be linked to the generation of new economic opportunities , in areas less prone to natural disasters . \nThis would require the expansion of secondary cities and agricultural modernisation . \n`` Done right , international intervention can deliver immediate jobs through construction , and longer-term jobs through new enterprises . \nDone wrong , it will only pour relief into Port-au-Prince , luring in rural migrants from the impoverished central plateau , and further diminishing local food production at a time when it is most needed , '' they wrote in the Financial Times . \nTo guarantee effective management of the funding in a country where the government was overwhelmed before the earthquake , economists have proposed pooling money into a single `` Haiti Fund '' that can be used for development . \n`` It should receive emergency outlays from the United States and other donors ; organise a board that includes members appointed by Haitian President Rene Preval , the UN secretary general and donors ; and empower a management team to formulate and execute plans agreed to by the Haitian government , '' wrote Jeffrey Sachs , a leading development economist , in the Washington Post . \nMr Sachs estimates that annual donations of $ 2bn to $ 3bn will be required over the next five years to cover urgent reconstruction costs and development financing . \nThe head of the International Monetary Fund , Dominique Strauss-Khan , has even gone so far as to call for a new `` Marshall Plan '' , which helped rebuild Europe after World War II , and warned against `` a piecemeal approach '' in Haiti . \nOne of the first steps in the transition from emergency relief into reconstruction and development is food security , and the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation -LRB- FAO -RRB- has warned that it is crucial that any damage to agricultural infrastructure must be repaired as soon as possible . \nFAO Director-General Jacques Diouf says famers must be given immediate support before the spring planting season begins in March . \nThe season , which lasts until May , accounts for 60 % of Haiti 's national agricultural production . \nOver the past 20 years Haiti has become dependent on food imports , yet around 80 % of the population are involved in agriculture . \nIn the long term , officials hope to develop a rural agricultural strategy that would enable Haiti to become more self-sufficient . \nAt the recent donor conference in Montreal , the US and other nations made it clear that Haiti 's government had to lead the reconstruction effort . \nThe international community also reiterated its support for Haiti 's President , Rene Preval , and its Prime Minister , Jean-Max Bellerive . \nMr Preval , who was elected in 2006 with broad popular support , initiated reforms of the police and judiciary with some success , according to Mark Schneider of the International Crisis Group . \nHis government was also able to forge a national consensus on a recovery plan following the devastating hurricanes of 2008 . \nNevertheless , the destruction of its ministries and deaths of hundreds of civil servants has meant the government has struggled to take control of the relief effort . \nSurvivors are growing increasingly frustrated by its perceived inaction . \n"}

' \nThat 's one of the best bits in the song . '' \nSo that means James spent the afternoon trying to better Michael Stipe by belting out ` Do n't throw your hand ... oh , no. . . \ndo n't throw your hand . ' \nBy mid-afternoon on Tuesday the artists at Sarm were starting to overlap , allowing James Morrison a rare Susan Boyle encounter . \n`` She was all pumped and ready to go , '' James said . \n`` She was cool , I leaned in to give her a kiss but I do n't think she was too keen on giving me a kiss . '' \nHardly a `` feed the world '' group hug moment , but then again this recording was low key in comparison . \nEach act came in one by one to stand at the single microphone in the voice booth in the middle of the relatively large studio , with that piano for Mika just off to one side . \nJames Morrison was joined by the likes of Rod Stewart and Alexandra Burke As for SuBo , she admitted she did n't know this REM song very well so had to learn her part from scratch . \nBut she thinks it 's a `` very nice song '' and admits `` it was an honor to be picked '' . \nThe day ended with Rod Stewart arriving to add his contribution after Simon Cowell called him personally , although more acts are expected to join in over the coming days . \nThe video to accompany Everybody Hurts is being made simultaneously with the recording , so in another nod to Band Aid , expect to see a lot of artists at the mic wearing headphones as they sing along . \nThe estimated release date is 7 February , with proceeds going to the Disasters Emergency Committee -LRB- DEC -RRB- and there 's already talk this could become one of the biggest selling singles of all time . \n"}
{"id": "117", "time": "2010-01-27", "text": "Haiti 's cathedral was in ruins after the earthquake In our series of viewpoints from African journalists , Ghanaian Elizabeth Ohene considers labels , hoaxes and Obamania . \nThis past week , like everybody else on the globe , I have been glued to the television screens watching the agony of the Haitians . \nI have heard over and over again that Haiti is the poorest country in the Western hemisphere and as the rhetoric has expanded , I have even heard Haiti was THE poorest country in the world . \nNow I do n't know what the truth is about these claims ; I have never been to Haiti and I have deep scepticism about terminology like GDP and the like . \nMy compatriots decided to demonstrate to the whole world that everybody might have mobile phones in Ghana but we remain a scientifically illiterate country One thing I do know is that there does not seem to be any evidence to contradict any of these claims about the level of poverty in Haiti when you watch the apocalyptic scenes on television . \nAn earthquake of that magnitude would cause chaos and devastation if it occurred anywhere in the world . \nBut surely it is a bit over the top to have an earthquake in which the archbishop gets killed , the head of the United Nations office gets killed and the presidential palace collapses . \nPat Robertson the American televangelist is reported to have put it all to the wrath of God who has shown his anger on the `` devil-worshipping '' Haitians . \nGhana lost to Ivory Coast but their fans are now celebrating again The Haitian consul to Sao Paulo , who happens to be white , was a touch more graphic . \nHe told a Brazilian TV crew that people of African origin were cursed . \n`` I think it has to do with messing so much with voodoo , '' he said . \nIn the midst of it all , my compatriots decided to demonstrate to the whole world that everybody might have mobile phones in Ghana but we remain a scientifically illiterate country when a nationwide panic was generated through text messages claiming that an earthquake was about to hit Ghana . \nMy suspicion is that the hoax was induced by a desperate attempt to get Ghana into the headlines when we had lost a football match to Didier Drogba . \nOr we were probably hoping that President Barack Obama would make a speech praising Ghana 's democracy . \nWe could n't allow Haiti to usurp Ghana 's position as the favored African\\/black country . \nIt is of course the anniversary of Barack Obama 's inauguration as US president and many on this continent are getting anxious that Africa has not featured high on his agenda . \nIf we want Mr Obama to be a successful president , Africa should resolve that the images of the continent will not be of wars , hunger , malnourished children and political chaos It is worth pointing out again for the umpteenth time that Barack Obama was elected by Americans as their president and his success or failure as president will be measured by how well Americans fare under his watch . \nAnd it seems to me that he will have a difficult time for as long as Africa continues to claim him as its own . \nI blame the results of the vote in Massachusetts on the Haitian earthquake . \nEvery time another Haitian comes on the TV , some in the US probably see the face of the man in the White House . \nIf we want Mr Obama to be a successful president , Africa should resolve that the images of the continent will not be of wars , hunger , malnourished children and political chaos . \nAnd we should stop claiming him as an African . \nIf I were his white mother I would be outraged every time someone referred to him as black . \nThanks for your comments . \nPlease read a selection below : Africans need black -LRB- African or African American -RRB- people to aspire to , I 'm a young African and all you tend to here about black is negative if we get a chance to promote some black positivity we should grab it Obama is black , I do n't think he will solve Africa 's problems but he inspires me to reach the very top ! \nEric Malebe , Johannesburg , South Africa No African or Ghanaian is saying that Obama is the answer to our problems . \nWe just feel honored that someone with an African background has worked had to earn such an enviable position who is also a source of inspiration to all groups of people who think such achievement is not possible . \nSecondly it is very wrong for Elizabeth to attempt to discuss scientific literacy or otherwise . \nHow many well resourced science labs do we have in our universities for those who claim to be scientist in Ghana . \nI do not even want to talk about science labs for the high schools . \nJust for the record you do not have to be literate to use a mobile phone . \nWhen someone is famous , people generally like to claim some kind of connection to them . \nBut Obama 's presidency should not be reduced to an issue of race , as he has already outlined the challenges of his mixed heritage in his books . \nHe also states his identity , so another person should n't presume to do so for him in a manner that could be offensive to some people with mixed heritage . \nI really find it amusing that Elizabeth , a senior colleague , can say that `` we should stop claiming him as an African . '' \nYes , Barack Obama is the president of the United States and there is absolutely no doubt that his primary duty is to protect the interests of the American people that elected him to the Oval Office . \nBut he is AFRICAN as well , even though it does not appears politically convenient to point this out to the American people . \nHe is a Kenyan national , as well as being American . \nThe last time I checked he has not renounced his Kenyan citizenship , which came through his father -LRB- the fact that he does not carry a Kenyan passport does not take this nationality away from him -RRB- . \nAnd he acknowledged the fact that he is Luo , -LRB- please read `` Dreams From My Father '' -RRB- notwithstanding the fact that he has only visited Kenya and never lived there . \nDoes Elisabeth or anyone else have concrete proof to contradict this ? \nWe need to get our facts right , even though I agree that Africa should not expect miracles or a great deal of attention from a man elected to solve the problems of Americans AND NOT AFRICANS . \nIt is obvious that the Middle East and certainly Afghanistan\\/Pakistan , are more of a worry for Obama than Africa . \nI would like to think that he would help Africa , if only for the stark fact that he is tied to Africa by blood . \nBut perhaps in this case , blood may not be thicker than water ... Osasu Obayiuwana , Associate Editor , NewAfrican magazine , Lagos , Nigeria\\/London , England I disagree with your views on the Democratic Party 's failure to obtain the Massachusetts senate seat . \nThe failure has much less to do with an unconscious connection between Haiti and our black president than an initiative by the people of Massachusetts to send a message that policies must be accounted for and progress must be obtained . \nAnother frustrating comment that you seem too willing to assume is that by having a black heritage , Mr. Obama is African . \nI suggest that President Obama is wholly American . \nAlthough his ethnicity presents itself inevitably from his African ancestry , it seems somewhat incoherent to suggest that his image as President of the United States is reflective of his ethnic heritage and `` tie '' to the African subcontinent . \nAs many Africans well know , their skin color does n't reflect their nationality . \nIf I were his mother , I would be proud of my son . \nBy suggesting that she should be frustrated if anyone called him black , you seem to eager and perhaps unconsciously call upon several issues unrelated to the presidency , Haiti , and the United States all together . \nElizabeth is right in her analysis . \nThe blackman is not cursed as Moses who liberated the Jews was black . \nKwame Nkurumah was not cursed . \nAfrica , like any other continent produced good son and daughters , and like any other continent produced bad children too . \nI sympathise with Obama I believe that Obama represents hope , aspiration and the future for the human race . \nHe is an African-American . \nAs an African living in Britain , Obama brings respectability to the black race through what he has done and continues to do . \nI know the Americans whether black or white agree that there is a bright future for everyone . \nMay God guide , protect and lead Obama 's path . \nBy the way , how is Obama 's US Presidency helping Africa ? \nFormer President Clinton was involve and is still involve with the development through his foundation . \nPresident G.W. Bush is known for education , health , and chasing dictators like Charles Taylor from Africa . \nFormer President Carter will be remembered for good governance and health . \nWhat has Obama done or what can he do ? \nEven his John McCain has worked or is working to help immigrants . \nI am sick and tire of hearing this Obama 's blackness or African thing . \nAfricans please try for yourself and leave `` poor '' Obama alone . \nBoima Gbelly , North Providence , RI . \nUSA Genetically Obama is of mixed heritage , phenotypically he is black ! \nAnd also politically he is black ! \nAnd no this was not a paradigm made up by Africans . \nCheck the history books , read , learn and you will grow . \nPeople have the right to refer to Obama as black ! \nI am amazed why some educated people are puzzled why a mixed race should be referred to as black . \n@Rasheed , my fellow countryman . \nI do n't know anyone who is sitting down waiting for Obama to rescue them . \nAnd there is nothing wrong with clinching onto the aspirations he represents to better yourself . \nIn fact , the messianic view of Obama is shared worldwide not just by Africans . \nThe author of this piece manages to mix several complicated issues into one . \nThere is no direct correlation between success in Africa and Obama 's presidency . \nAnd everyone can claim Obama if they so desire ! \nElizabeth , I understand your argument - to an extent - I for one refuse to call Mr. Obama , black . \nSimply because he is not . \nHowever , your comments and viewpoints about our beloved country 's earthquake fear , is perhaps too cynical and a little insensitive . \nAny country in the world would have reacted the same way , it was sent by text and could have only been disputed when the authorities came to know about it , which is exactly what happened . \nYou of all people should know what Ghana is like on the ground , people dropped out of school to make money for their families , Ghana is not a country overflowing with 25 million scientists . \nSome things can not be helped . \nFrankly , Obama can not do much for Africa because he is fighting for his political survival . \nInstead of focusing attention on what goes on outside US , Obama should first try to solve the problem of black American . \nAfrica will take care of itself . \nEnough of foreign aid that is making us more dependent ! \nAfter all , despite all the doomsday scenario and brutal colonialism , Africa is still standing . \nContrary to what prophet of doom , Pat Robertson , thinks , neither Africa nor Haiti is cursed . \nIt is a scare tactics to make black people irrelevant . \nYou wonder while many people are sceptical of organised religion . \nGbenga I beg to differ ! \nObama is ours and we will claim him , whether good or bad . \nEven great schools like Harvard and Yale claim our purely African leaders whom they trained . \nAs an African living in London , I am 100 % in support of what Elizabeth mentioned in her report . \nIt leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth when the whole continent lays so much hope on one man 's journey and then forgets all that has been said and done and still continues to be cast in the most undignified manner . \nTake for example my country of birth Sierra Leone . \nWe went through ten years of madness killing each other and after all that the people are still facing the same problems . \nThe country is still being managed in the same manner , where we still need the west to answer our calls to maintain our daily living . \nNo Mr Obama is coming my people - it 's time we get our self out of this dream and start living . \nPresident Obama sent his Secretary of State , Hillary Rodham Clinton , on a high profile tour in Africa , so I am not sure how you can say that Africa does n't figure into his agenda . \nAs well , although I appreciate your resolution that images of Africa not be negative , your closing comment regarding his mother projects racism and self hate . \nIf you know much about identity politics in the US , you might also realize that `` African '' and `` black '' are different . \nWhich one is better or worse of an association for Barack Obama ? \nI ca n't say . \nI am one that thinks that change will come through the positive image of a black POTUS being projected everywhere to over the next few years and will positively influence young people . \nI am from Massachusetts and what I think you fail to realize is that when I see my President I do not see him as African because he is an American as I am . \nI also see him by his party affiliation . \nHe is a Democrat and that is what fuels the majority of Americans regarding their views of their president . \nPresident Obama has been fixated on passing `` universal '' health care , which it is not , and the people of Massachusetts voted in a Republican to fill the empty Senate seat of deceased Sen. Kennedy not because of Haiti but because of the impending passage of the health care bill . \nThe people of Massachusetts and his white mother take no offense to the fact that President Obama has a rich cultural heritage that includes Africa . \nThe color of my skin happens to be white . \nBut I know the whole world originated in Africa . \nOr at the least a significant majority of earths present inhabitants . \nSo the article was completely refreshing . \nGenuinely appreciated and nestled in my heart , mind and soul . \nYour statement : `` If I were his white mother I would be outraged every time someone referred to him as black '' is moronic , because his mother raised him so he knew about his black culture . \nObama loves his African heritage and identifies himself as being African American -LRB- not white -RRB- . \nTo say that Africans should not support him is asinine and dumb . \nAs far as I am concerned Obama is post graduate of Harvard University . \nThere is no Africa about his being a US president . \nHe is just like and in the same age as Clinton , JFK , to name but a few . \nMoreover , the UK did not change as Ian Smith became president of Rhodesia , nor Holland as Botha became that of Apartheid South Africa . \nThe Holabohi , the Wahala and Palava over Obama 's African connection is nothing but `` much ado about nothing '' or `` as you like it '' . \nAfrica needs to help herself meet the millennium goals through good governance , accountability , nonviolence etc. . \nObama is the President of the USA not Africa . \nThough he has some of his roots in Africa Obama is not black but bi-racial . \nI have a fiancee who is bi-racial and it is always insulting to her as well her white mother when people call her a black woman . \nIt takes her mother out of the picture . \n"}
{"id": "1109", "time": "2010-01-27", "text": "Classic pop , reappraised by the Magazine Stars including Kylie Minogue , Take That and Mariah Carey are recording REM 's Everybody Hurts as a charity single for Haiti . \nBut what is the original song about , and why is it associated with suicide ? \nIt started out as a song to comfort `` younger people '' , and the attempt to make it accessible to someone `` who has n't been to college '' has made it applicable in all kinds of situations . \nFrom 8th album Automatic For The People UK number seven -LRB- April 1993 -RRB- Number three ` Song to listen to when depressed ' -LRB- 6Music poll , 2004 -RRB- Number two ` Gen X funeral song ' -LRB- Bereavement Register , 1993 -RRB- Number one ` Cry-Pod song ' -LRB- Poll for Irish radio station RTE , 2007 -RRB- Everybody Hurts is not a typical REM song . \nFor one thing , you can make out all of singer-songwriter Michael Stipe 's words . \nMore importantly , it 's immediately obvious what they mean : do n't give up . \nAnd so the song has had a much more varied and exposed life than most of REM 's output , even before the imminent celeb-carousel rendition . \nIt was , for example , the first song played by Radio 1 after the two minutes ' silence to mark 1996 's Dunblane shootings . \nA version edited to include the sounds of the attacks on the Twin Towers was widely circulated online in late 2001 . \nAnd the track rubbed shoulders with Candle In The Wind and I 'll Be Missing You on the official Diana Memorial album . \nBut the troubles that the song originally speaks to are more personal . \nIn the 1993 video , Stipe is portrayed among drivers stuck in an almighty Texas traffic jam , each with troubles on his or her mind , all of these conveyed in subtitles . \nAmong them is a teenager staring out of a window , thinking : `` They 're going to miss me . '' \nAnd suicide - especially among the young - is the personal problem with which Everybody Hurts is most often associated . \nIn 2001 , the Nevada Assembly passed a resolution praising REM for `` encouraging the prevention of teen suicides '' , specifically mentioning Everybody Hurts . \nAnd in 1995 , the Samaritans marked the first anniversary of the suicide of Kurt Cobain with adverts in music magazines which consisted of two verses of the song . \nIf you 're consciously writing for someone who has n't been to college , or is pretty young , it might be nice to be very direct . \nIn that regard , it 's tended to work for people of a lot of ages `` We 've tended to license the song out for free to charity , '' guitarist Peter Buck told the BBC in 2005 . \nIn the same interview -LRB- see link on right -RRB- , Stipe is characteristically evasive , but Buck is more forthcoming . \n`` I remember Michael saying something to the effect that he wanted younger people to not have to worry about metaphors , '' he said . \n`` The only metaphor is in the bridge : ` throw your hand ' , which is a card-game metaphor . '' \nIt 's also , to many , a metaphor for taking one 's life . \nIs it incongruous , then , to apply the lyric to Haitians affected by an earthquake ? \n` Things are tough but they get better ' Not necessarily . \nBuck told Mojo magazine that `` trying to reach a 17-year-old and say , ` it 's OK - things are tough but they get better ' '' involved economy and directness - and that universality automatically means the song is picked up on by other people . \nThe simplicity of the music helps , too . \nBased on a beat from a drum machine that cost $ 20 , the track revolves around a few familiar arpeggiated chords . \nEven after the arrival of the strings , arranged by former Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones , there 's an intimacy that fits the lyric , and a vocal from Stipe that , in the words of rock critic Garry Mulholland , expresses `` all the personal tragedies and troughs that he has traveled through '' . \nAn earlier version included the line : `` Everybody hurts , even the singer of the song . '' \nThe charity-single template is , of course , very different to this , and Simon Cowell , the organiser of the new version , is not usually associated with musical restraint . \nHowever , the point of next week 's release is not faithfulness to the REM original , it 's something more commonly associated with Mr Cowell - that is money , in this case for Haiti . \nAs for REM , Stipe says : `` How could we not say yes to this appeal ? \nWe 're honored to play even a small role in trying to help . '' \nThis echoes what Buck told the BBC in 2005 : `` The song belongs more to the people that it 's aimed at than it does to the band any more . '' \nSmashed Hits is compiled by Alan Connor . \nAdd your comments on this story , using the form below . \nI am a vicar . \nAt funerals I would normally expect to be able to rein in my emotions , but this song will always cause a tear to flow . \nOn one occasion as I took the funeral of a suicide , we played this as part of some reflective prayer and the whole congregation , including me and the funeral director , were in tears . \nIn my first term at university , I was wracked with absolute gut-wrenching homesickness . \nI heard this song on the radio late one night , and it was like a light-bulb . \nIt made me realize that it was OK to be missing home , but that it was going to work out if I just hung in there and stayed the course . \nI saw REM live later that year , and hearing them play Everybody Hurts , with 100,000 other voices in the crowd remains a very special memory to me . \nI am not surprised Simon Cowell thought a song about suicide was appropriate for Haiti - he thought a song about sexual anguish was suitable for the Xmas number one in 2008 . \nI am a big REM fan and in its original context the song really works . \nI CAN imagine being desperate enough to want to commit suicide - so yes , everybody does hurt . \nBut I can in no way imagine what it is like to be in Haiti now . \nEverybody does not hurt as they do . \nTo tell them that everybody hurts , as if we can in some way empathise , feels patronising . \nI love this song . \nIt 's a reminder that when you think you have it bad , other people have it worse and things will get better . \nA beautiful , simple piece of music and wonderful lyrics from Messers Stipe and Berry . \nAn all time classic . \nAs an expert on depression I can assure you that if you are depressed then you want to avoid this song completely . \nIt 's a neat song if you 're in a reflective mood yes , but depression ... oh no ! \nThis is an incredibly uplifting song that is both inspirational and powerful . \nI think that perhaps millions of people have at one time not given up on something because of listening to this song . \nAbsolutely fitting to be used here . \nThe most comforting things to be told when you 're in a terrible state are that you 're not alone and that things will get better ; you will be alright . \nThis song does both of those , and it speaks to you as an individual . \nNo , REM do n't know you or your individual pains , but this song says that somebody cares . \nEveryone has been through something , so everyone understands the song . \nEverybody Hurts is a great , great song and is no doubt going to be beaten to within an inch of its artistic credibility by this selection of pop stars . \nWould n't it be better to do a brand new song , or better still for REM to repackage the original and allow all proceeds from now on go to the Haiti fund ? \nAll the pop stars could just contribute by buying it a few times . \nREM 's Everybody Hurts is a classic song that is as relevant today as it was in 1992 . \nWhilst I appreciate the new version will be for charity , I fear it will be a travesty of the original , ie bland and cheesy . \nI will probably listen to Automatic For The People tonight and donate a couple of quid to Oxfam instead . \nThe BBC may edit your comments and not all emails will be published . \nYour comments may be published on any BBC media worldwide . \n"}

{"id": "1702", "time": "2010-01-18", "text": "Gavin Hewitt | 10:35 UK time , Monday , 18 January 2010 At every disaster you find emergency teams from Europe . \nIn the Pakistani earthquake I flew in a German helicopter . \nThe Swiss arrived early . \nI found the same covering the tsunami in Asia . \nThe Italian teams , as always , proved they have some of the best rescue workers in the world . \nSo again this time in Haiti . \nThere are Welsh firefighters rescuing a two-year old girl . \nSpanish and French teams have been tearing at the rubble at the Hotel Montana . \nIn a disaster the secret to early success is small mobile teams that arrive quickly and save lives . \nInitially it is difficult co-ordinating these teams . \nNational search and rescue squads have to deploy at once . \nThey go into neighborhoods and , like with the Israeli team yesterday , they pull survivors from the rubble where they find them . \nIt is always chaotic . \nAt every disaster I have reported on the same complaints are heard . \nChaos is at the heart of disaster . \nIn Phuket in Thailand they said that bodies were not disposed of quickly enough . \nIn Kashmir I flew into villages that had not received any help ten days after the earthquake had struck . \nIn Turkey it was said there were too many rescue teams and I saw some trying to find a building where there were not dog teams working already . \nEven in the United States , after Hurricane Katrina , we found ourselves rescuing families from the water . \nOf course the aim is to establish co-ordination . \nIt is much harder in Haiti because there is not a functioning government . \nDelivery of aid is difficult without security . \nThat lies at the heart of the tension between France and the United States . \nThe Americans control the airport and they are setting up a military operation in Haiti so some of their military planes have landed first . \nThat has infuriated the French . \nA plane carrying an inflatable hospital from France was diverted . \nThe French Foreign Minister , Bernard Kouchner , complained the airport had become a `` US annexe '' . \nSuch tensions , in my experience , are inevitable . \nThe lesson of every disaster I have covered is that co-ordination is best done on the ground . \nIt is not a role for ministers or bureaucrats hundreds or thousands of miles away . \nIt does n't work like that . \nNow the EU 's response is complicated by the fact that it is learning to live with new structures . \nIt has a foreign policy chief in Catherine Ashton . \nShe has said that `` rebuilding Haiti is now a priority for the EU '' There was also , in her public statements , the suggestion that she was `` co-ordinating '' the different activities of the European Union with the member states . \nNow there clearly is a role for the EU in planning for the long-term development of Haiti and that will be discussed at a meeting of development ministers today . \nBut there is a question as to what role the EU should play in coordinating emergency search and rescue and relief operations . \nCertainly the EU , as an institution , is not essential for rescue work to be effective . \nNations have acted decisively and quickly without referring to international institutions . \nIceland despatched 35 members of its search and rescue team . \nCanada has its Sea King helicopters in action . \nBrazilian rescue workers are in place . \nThe Chinese had people in Port-au-Prince by 0200 on 14 January . \nI suspect a dilemma here for the EU . \nThere is a current obsession to be seen as a `` player '' on the world stage . \nThis need , in part , lay behind the Lisbon Treaty . \nIt is often easy for that desire to translate into wanting to act as if the EU were a state . \nIt has no military capacity . \nEven if the EU 's military was under one command it would be hard to match the US with its aircraft-carrier , hospital ship , logistical power and its ability to deploy thousands of troops while it is fighting two campaigns overseas . \nThe fact that Europe can not do that does not make it somehow weak or ineffective , as some have suggested . \nThe question is more where the EU should best put its energy . \nThe EU may be most effective at coordinating medium and long-term development . \nToday it is set to announce 100m euros -LRB- #

to say that there have been many Haitians who also bear responsibility for Haiti 's plight . \nBut please consider the following points : Barbados has a population of about 281,968 Haiti has almost 10,000,000 people . \nHaiti witnessed the greatest exploitative slave-based system in all of the Caribbean region . \nNo people experienced the degradation and debasement as much as the Haitian slaves . \nTheir output was so productive that for a period of time this small piece of land out produced all the other islands in the Caribbean , and provided France with some 40 % of its empire 's coffers . \nAlso , read the following article : When it came to Haiti , France was first a brutal colonizer , and then a usurious bully . \nTunku Varadarajan on why it s time for reparations . \nAs Haitians lurch destitute in the rubble , and as governments , churches , and NGOs do the best they can to bring succor to Haiti 's hell , a vivid solution to the country 's needs presents itself , one so obvious and irrefutable so resonantly just that it must be advocated with the greatest of energy : France must repay its colonialist debt to Haiti by paying for much of the island country s reconstruction . \nHaiti 's chronic impoverishment began at its birth in 1804 , when , having overthrown its French rulers in a bloody , 12-year slave revolt , the newborn nation was subjected to crippling blockades and embargoes . \nThis economic strangulation continued until 1825 , when France offered to lift embargoes and recognize the Haitian Republic if the latter would pay restitution to France for loss of property in Haiti , including slaves of 150 million gold francs . \nThe sum , about five times Haiti 's export revenue for 1825 , was brutal , but Haiti had no choice : Pay up or perish over many more years of economic embargo , not to mention face French threats of invasion and reconquest . \nTo pay , Haiti borrowed money at usurious rates from France , and did not finish paying off its debt until 1947 , by which time its fate as the Western Hemisphere 's poorest country had been well and truly sealed . \nIn this era of multibillion-dollar bailouts of private banking institutions , $ 22 billion should scarcely raise a Gallic eyebrow . \nBut to Haiti , the sum would be a godsend . \nFrance must now return every last cent of this money to Haiti . \nIn 2004 , at the time of the 200th anniversary of Haiti 's independence , the Haitian government put together a legal brief in support of a formal demand for `` restitution '' from France . \nThe sum sought was nearly $ 22 billion , a number arrived at by calculations that included a notionally equitable annual interest rate . \n-LRB- For a full account of the calculation , read Jose de Cordoba 's excellent news story in The Wall Street Journal , published on Jan. 2 , 2004 . -RRB- \nThe demand was made by President Jean-Bertrand Aristide , a firebrand ex-preacher who was forced out of office by a violent uprising that February . \nHis successors , Boniface Alexandre and Gerard Latortue , controversially chose to renounce Haiti 's claim for restitution\\/reparations . \n-LRB- There was , of course , much pressure exerted on them by France , which had found Aristide 's demand politically disconcerting . -RRB- \ncents Plus : Mark Leon Goldberg on Haiti s recent history , and why the country deserves our support . \nThis last act of renunciation weakens Haiti 's legal case against France , notwithstanding the fact that the treaty under which France gouged 150 million gold francs from Haiti was clearly unconscionable and executed under duress . \nBut this story is not one of law and legality alone , nor even one of wealth and poverty . \n-LRB- France 's GDP is $ 2.85 trillion , while Haiti 's is a mere $ 6.95 billion . -RRB- \nIt is , rather , one of historical justice and political morality : No one can dispute that an extortionate and bullying treaty , concluded at a time when France was an imperial hyper-puissance and Haiti a friendless fledgling , is an ugly stain on France 's national conscience . \nThe money involved is not a sum that will give sleepless nights to Christine Lagarde -LRB- France 's finance minister -RRB- or Bernard Kouchner -LRB- its foreign minister -RRB- or President Nicolas Sarkozy . \nIn this era of multibillion-dollar bailouts of private banking institutions , $ 22 billion should scarcely raise a Gallic eyebrow . \nBut to Haiti , the sum would be a godsend . \nMore than that , however , this is money that is Haiti 's own . \nAs Haitians lie prostrate , buried under the rubble of their nation , France must do the moral thing , the just thing , the civilized thing : France must write Haiti a reparations check for $ 22 billion

believe that poorer peoples , far from the Statue of Liberty , should not want in their heart of hearts to become Americans . \nActually what Americans find on foreign soil is that so many people in foreign countries whether rich or poor are so petty , so stupid . \nThey will argue over the most meaningless trifles in life . \nFor example Ireland was at war for 400 years with Britain over the fact that Henry VIII renounced Catholicism because a French politician through an influential friend convinced the pope not to grant him an anullment to his marriage in which he could not produce a male heir . \nSo he quit Catholicism , formed his own church and Anglicans and Protestants fought to the death ever since . \nIt ended in Ireland with that nation 's independence in the 20th century but not in Northern Ireland until about a decade ago . \nIt is sobering to think that when America declared independence from Britain this war had been going on for nearly two hundred years already . \nIt 's just one of countless examples you see around the world . \nBTW , a lot of people around the world do want to go to America , live in America , work in America , and become Americans . \nPeople from all over the world in a tide that has kept growing for over 400 years . \nSpeaking of countless examples , the barbaric crimes France perpetrated against Haiti is only one of countless examples of European pettiness , stupidity and vindictiveness . \nIt was the same mindset that penned the Treaty of Versailles that lead straight the rise of Hitler , to WWII , and to the occupation of France . \nHave the French ever learned their lesson ? \nLook at their anger over their plane being delayed landing in Port au Prince for a day or so . \nJust who the hell do they think they are ? \nHave other Europeans learned ? \nNot on your life . \nFrom the disaster which is the EU to most of its member states it has hardly altered its view of itself or the world . \nRacist , xenophobic , arrogant , and provincial they think they are the center of the world and of civilization when in fact they are a fading souvenir stuffed in the pages of an old history book . \nLilliputians with their pompousness squeaking and screeching , more of an annoyance than even a nuissance . \nis Europe 's last gasp effort -LRB- actually France 's and Germany 's -RRB- to be a major player in the politics of the world . \nThey have only made peace with each other because each finally realized they could n't do it alone , especially France . \nYou can see how effective they 've been by the way President Obama and the other real players snubbed them at Copenhagen and how the US just brushed France aside . \nTheir protests fall on deaf ears in Washington DC where President Obama has far more important issues to worry about ... such as who will win Senator Kennedy 's seat in the United State Senate in the special election tomorrow . \nThis could decide the fate of his health care

'' \nBut just like the belief in a creator , a belief in `` government\\/nation the creator of all goodness '' requires a massive leap of faith . \nTo get involved in this sort of thinking , you need to have faith that governments drive human behavior , and reject the common observation that government employees and party members are parasites who feed from human behavior . \nNote the way Marcus cites Germany and Japan as economic miracles created by the largess of US big business . \nHe does not mention central and south America , the Middle eastern or african countries , even though US foreign policy has been cultivating regimes in those places for just as long as it has in German and Japan . \nFurthermore , Marcus rejects the influence of the people of these nations . \nHe rejects the idea that it was the germans who rebuilt germany with hard work and technical know how . \nHe rejects the idea that a very highly ordered and productive Japanese culture was what drove the people of that culture to rebuild their country and living standards . \nHe places all the credit for good things upon American business , and the policy of American governments . \nWe see the same selective attribution of credit for good results with chris commenting on the EU . \nIf Europe is wealthy , it is not because governments have merely refrained from going to war and let the people get on with living their lives , but rather it is because the EU government MADE THIS HAPPEN . \nGovernment receives the credit , and the people are the inert and grateful recipients of government actions . \nI find this thought process fascinating , and very much akin to the process of attributing good fortune and the hard work of others to god . \nGovernment is a classic rainmaker , just like the priesthood and the shamans before them : it promises rain , and when it rains the government takes all the credit . \nIf it does n't rain , government actors blame the people , and promise rain again . \nEventually , it rains . \nWhat fascinates me about this cycle of claiming credit and issuing blame is that most people seem to demand it . \nIt is not a trick , a scheme set down from a conspiracy of exploiters . \nInstead , we see Marcus and AT2 and chris and Mathiasen all desperate to pin down a large group and make it holier than themselves . \nPeople WANT to worship , they create their gods out of nothing . \nIt seems to be the human condition to pick a rain maker and sacrifice a sinner before the gods . \nPerhaps this is why democracy , real democracy , is such an effective form of government . \nWhen the people are sovereign , and when the common people are promoted in the culture as `` those responsible for laws '' , then the people are the rainmakers . \nDirect democracy is a neat trick indeed , if it can get folks to worship themselves instead of idols and shamans . \nConsidering it is a brutal , unfair and horribly hostile universe out there ... can you blame them ?

'' \nThese investments are very well specified and must meet very strict criteria . \nIt is this part financing that forces national governments to create `` investment cycles '' that will absorb this money whilst forcing nation states to provide the rest of the money for the investment ; i.e. governments must use their own internal tax revenue to set up investments to be able to get the remaining funds ; generally if they dont the government will be booted out by its citizens . \nThe result of this policy is that Europe now has the best infrastructure in the world , much better than the USA . \nThis has created probably about another 10 to 30 million jobs directly and indirectly . \nThirdly , every expansion makes the EU internationally more competative on price , which in business is the most important factor . \nBecause manufacturers set up their factories in low wage countries -LRB- such as Poland , Slovakia -RRB- instead of offshoring to China . \nThis has created hundreds of thousands of jobs and kept industry `` within the EU '' rather than outsourcing to the third world . \nFourt , you may dislike this but CAP -LRB- the much disputed and subsadised Common Agricultural Policy -RRB- has created millions of jobs in Europe because it blocks the import of dirt cheap food from third world countries . \nThere are many other examples : Longest peace in Europe in history . \nCitizens can work live and study in any member state . \nIt is EU regulations that have forced all member states to cut bureaucracy by 25 % with strict penalties if they dont . \nGiant companies that were created to keep Europe self sufficient in even the most technologically advanced sectors such as manufacture of Airplanes and satellites . \nAnd all this at a cost of 0.86 % of GDP , in comparison the Westminster parliament consumes 50 % of GDP . \nIn fact , the EU is now so well developed that it is virtually completely self sufficient , has a much larger economy than the USA , and it makes everything . \nThe USA on the other hand is different . \nWhat Europeans spend on healthcare , education , assisting the poor , pensions for the old and training for the unemployed , the USA goes out and spends all this on its military and then goes around telling everybody what to do . \nAnd this is the problem . \nWE , TRUE EUROPEANS , DONT WANT TO BE TOLD BY THEM WHAT TO DO OR HOW TO DO IT and certainly we are not going to suck up to them , why should we ? \nAnd this is really where all the roads end . \nWe want complete independence of them . \nP.s just to illustrate : i am from Poland , grew up in the UK , my wife is Chinese and we live in the south of France . \nSo dont try to tell me i dont know anything about the EU . \n`` All hands on deck !

I am not trying to minimize at all the significance or very real trauma of the suffering of Haitians today . \nThe outpouring of concern , compassion , horror , strikes me as altogether healthy : a sign of true intelligence . \nWe can make the connection between `` that poor suffering person '' and `` myself '' : that is a step forward , out of cynicism , narcissism & indifference . \nBut let us for one moment remember the great European wars of the 20th century . \nOur parents -- mine , certainly -- lived through every bit the same kind of horror as what now convulses Haiti . \nThey witnessed this exact kind of living hell . \nThe ones who survived to tell the tale were also the ones who exerted themselves to prevent any repetition of such madness ever again across the Eurasian supercontinent . \nWe can not yet predict earthquakes with enough accuracy to implement preventive policies -- although the evidence is in that a clear warning , a Genuine Prediction , if you will , of this devastating earthquake , was provided in explicit terms by scientists just two years ago . \nThat would have been enough time to take some steps that would have not only saved lives in 2010 , but also reduced the stress on resources in this frenzied rescue effort . \nBut even while we can not yet predict or avert natural disasters , we should lose no further time in formulating better strategies for improving conditions in the most marginalised communities on the planet . \nWe should not be waiting for a repeat of the tragedy in Haiti -- or the worst dramas of the African conflict of recent decades -- before we intervene with effective constructive support & encouragement for struggling governments overwhelmed by masses of destitute , undernourished , underemployed citizens who need more than slogans , hugs and music videos to advance . \nIt should not have taken an earthquake of this magnitude to mobilise the powers of this world to lift up eight or nine million Haitians before their land had been reduced to rubble -- and even well before 97 % of their forest had been annihilated for cheap fuel . \nOf course , it is praiseworthy and appropriate of the EU to offer help , relief & expertise . \nBut the superpower of the hemisphere -- that would be the USA -- also needs to face up to the fact that a resolute refusal to do the timely simple things that help the region -- simple things like lifting the ridiculously protracted , vindictive & ultimately petty embargo on US trade with Cuba -- have spread misery & reinforced dysfunctionality in this beautiful , fragile zone of the planet . \nMaybe the terrible , regrettable sacrifice that has been exacted of Haitians over the past week will actually force the issue at last , and lead to a lasting transformation not only of Haiti , but of all its neighbouring states as well , as the wealthy & powerful ones of this world are finally moved to rediscover their shared humanity with the destitute whose destinies they -LRB- unfortunately -RRB- do indeed control . \nLet us hope this earthquake was big enough to shatter even the hardest hearts of those that have it taken upon themselves to make decisions for all the world . \nBecause we will not find a way out of any of the troubles that blight our lives , until the powerful wealthy ones unclench those fists , and let the needed funding finally trickle forth ... The longer they take to do so , the more money becomes necessary to do the repairs . \nJust ask Paul Krugman . \nHe seems to know the score . \nAt 02:30 am on 21 Jan 2010 , WebAliceinwonderland wrote : Looked up links at 145 , 146 . \n-LRB- Pity Part 2 is n't voiced over , closed for authorship rights . -RRB- \nWell what to say . \nIf it consoles you in any way , Russians always found most of what Khruschev did rather stupid : o -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- and right back then when he was doing it , and during Perestroyka , and in our new neo-marxism : o -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- mode - no change . \nAnd playing with fire with you -LRB- most here were not of Khruschev 's opinion that it is an innocent joke : o -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- - rather , had another idea of your how to say , mould , - and planting corn beyond the Polar circle - and bulldozing art exhibition as sure quick way `` to close it up '' - and awarding half of modern Ukraine to Republic of Ukraine , by cutting a chunk off Russia . \nOn the other hand , we cosnsistently give him credit for closing up Gulags , opening prizons ' doors letting all go , and for the melt-down the so-called thaw that gave enormous impulse for country 's development and resulted as a by-pass part product in the whole generation of `` shestidesyatniki '' - 60-years ' ones , the generation of the 60-s . \nWhich is a quality mark here still , most worthy intellectual forces and philosophers and writers and poets and musicians and film directors and composers a whole crop grew up out of cold ground out of nowhere immediately shooted through the asphalt . \nRight , later on they were pressed down rolled into asphalt again : o -RRB- but still we had a breath of air and the next one was decades after so we fondly remember Khrushev for that , for letting rein Mavrelius , by the way you are inconsistent , you are supposed to dislike Khruschev and what he did , right ?

'' \nSeveral looters were reported to have been lynched or shot dead . \nEstimates of the numbers killed by the earthquake range from 50,000 to at least 200,000 . \nSpeaking in Port-au-Prince , Mr Ban called the situation in Haiti `` one of the worst humanitarian crises in decades '' . \n37 UN staff confirmed dead , more than 300 missing Includes Special Representative Hedi Annabi , deputy Luiz Carlos da Costa and acting police commissioner Doug Coates UN HQ in the Christopher Hotel and other buildings collapsed in the quake Believed to be the biggest single loss of life in the UN 's history He visited the ruins of the UN mission , where several senior UN staff were killed . \nOne Danish UN worker was pulled alive from the rubble of the building on Sunday afternoon - one of at least five people who were rescued in Port-au-Prince during the day . \nMr Ban also went to an improvised settlement for survivors opposite the destroyed presidential palace , where people were shouting : `` Where is the food ? \nWhere is the help ? '' \nLater Mr Ban said he understood people 's frustration , but that he did not want to see violence among desperate survivors . \n`` I appeal to the Haitian people to be more patient , '' Mr Ban said . \nHe said providing daily food to two million people , as the UN has pledged , would be a `` huge challenge '' . \n`` We need to make sure our help is getting to people who need it as fast as possible , '' he added . \nThe UN has launched an appeal for $ 562m -LRB- # 346m -RRB- intended to help three million people for six months , most of whom are thought to need emergency relief . \nThe UN World Food Programme said it expected to reach about 60,000 people on Sunday , up from 40,000 a day before . \nA US aid official said he thought US authorities had handed out 130,000 meals , but many more were needed . \nThe British government is to triple its aid to Haiti to # 20m -LRB- $ 37m -RRB- . \nThe move is to be formally announced at an emergency meeting of EU development ministers in Brussels on Monday . \nCorrespondents say there is a sense of movement at last with the relief effort , although the amount of supplies getting through is still small . \nThe BBC 's David Loyn says the streets of the capital are thronged with homeless people , sleeping in the open and walking for hours for what food and water is available . \nMost of the food and water being given out is being distributed informally by local people , correspondents say . \nSeveral agencies or countries complained about not being able to get aid through at the airport , which is heavily congested and has been taken over by the US military . \nMedecins Sans Frontieres urged commanders to speed up the landing of aeroplanes carrying medical supplies , after one carrying an inflatable field hospital was turned away on Saturday night . \nThe head of the US operation at the airport , Col Buck Elton , said there had been 600 take-offs and landings since the US took control on Wednesday , and 50 flights had been diverted . \n`` What we set up here would be similar to running a major airport ... without any communications , electricity or computers , '' he said . \nUS troops also said they had set up their first foothold outside the airport to deliver aid carried in by helicopters . \nThe city 's port is badly damaged , and many roads still blocked by corpses and debris . \nThe Haitian and Dominican Republic governments are planning an alternative 130km -LRB- 80 mile -RRB- humanitarian road corridor to deliver relief supplies from the southern Dominican town of Barahona , the UN said . \nWe need fuel to bring in supplies and carry the wounded The UN has warned about fuel shortages , which it says could affect humanitarian operations . \nIt has also emerged that the US naval base at Guantanamo , Cuba - synonymous with the war on terror - is being used as a staging post for personnel and relief supplies heading to Haiti . \nThe BBC 's Steve Kingstone , at the base , says it has capacity to house up to 10,000 people in tents . \nWhile there are no firm plans for that , US commanders say such an evacuation is feasible should it become necessary . \nThe US and Dutch authorities have said they are speeding up the process of flying orphaned children away from Haiti to adoptive parents abroad . \nSix Haitian children adopted by Dutch families arrived in the Netherlands on Sunday and the justice ministry said it was expediting the adoption process and paperwork for about 100 others . \nEstimates of how many people died following the 7.0 magnitude earthquake on Tuesday have varied . \nThe Pan American Health Organization put the death toll at 50,000-100 ,000 , while Haitian Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive said 100,000 `` would seem a minimum '' . \nA UN official has said aid workers are dealing with a disaster `` like no other '' in UN memory because the country had been `` decapitated '' . \nThree ministers and several senators are reported to have been killed . \n"}

\nWhen we crossed the checkpoints , they let us through no problem and showed respect for us . \nLast night we could smell that horrible smell , because the windows are open in the house . \nThat team is under a lot of stress because they have extremely limited surgical capabilities . \nI spoke to a surgeon yesterday , and he was so frustrated and stressed about the fact that five patients he saw yesterday needed immediate surgery . \nIt 's getting worse because the patients who were not critical only three days ago are now in critical phases But he ca n't save their lives because they do n't have a proper operational theater . \nWe need more space to perform surgeries , which the inflatable hospital will provide - if it ever arrives ! \nSo , it 's getting worse because the patients who were not critical only three days ago , are now in critical phases . \nThis means that people will die from preventable infections . \nIt 's horrible , it 's really so terrible that people are begging for help and we ca n't help them all to save their lives . \nIt 's the night shift here at the operations base and it is finally quiet . \nThe MapAction team is still up preparing directions and maps for the morning 's missions . \nThe window is fast closing and the urban search and rescue team are going for a final push to find and extract people . \nWe in the back-office are also pushing to get what they need to maximize the time left . \nThe camaraderie among all in the operation is great and there is the feeling that every life saved is a tribute to all . \nSUNDAY 17 JANUARY - CARWYN HILL This morning I arrived back from my first trip to Port-au-Prince . \nI can barely believe what I have seen . \nIt is as if I entered a different world . \nYesterday 's mission was to seek out appropriate places for us to send aid . \nThe water we handed out was an incredible blessing , and today we are planning a large truck to take down thousands of water sachets . \nWe will also be transporting some very important medical supplies to an Orthopaedic Surgery team in Port-au-Prince who we work with . \nIt took us over 4 hours to get from one side of the city to the other . \nPeople walked through the streets aimlessly with nowhere to go , carrying the few bags and possessions they had left . \nMany crammed onto any vehicle available desperate to leave . \nThe mass exodus of Port-au-Prince has begun , and on our way out we followed cars full of the injured , and in some cases even the dead . \nAs we drove through the city the scale of the atrocity sunk in further . \nHuman bodies were used beside burning tires and rocks for road blocks . \nSome roads had been closed whilst one of the few remaining hospitals discharged the mass of patients they could n't help any more . \nThose hospitals that did survive are dangerously low on medication and most , from my understanding are completely out of supplies . \nPeople are turned away , even a child I saw carried in desperately by his mother . \nTragically the doctors just had to say , ` we ca n't do anything , you must look elsewhere . ' \nAt the moment though there simply is n't really anywhere to go . \nOn the way back our car was full of refugees . \nIt was strange hearing their conversations as they listed the dead . \nWe had just a small number of the many thousands leaving . \nMany already filling hospitals up North . \nOur ` unfinished ' wards are now being prepared for action . \nWe 've bought mattresses , cleaned beds , and got the ward as finished as possible with what we have . \nOur staff have worked tirelessly on this . \nWe do n't know when we will start receiving patients as we will be acting as an overflow facility for the government hospital which struggles on a normal day without the predicted large influx of people . \n`` Broken bones are the most common injuries '' I 've been living in Ecuador for four years . \nI 'm originally from Yorkshire . \nI 'm with a team of seven medical staff working at the Baptist Haiti Mission hospital on a mountain above Port-au-Prince . \nIt 's a 100-bed hospital and we have at least 300 people here . \nWhen we got here there was only one doctor , he was almost falling asleep on his feet from exhaustion and was absolutely delighted to see us . \nInjured people are lining the corridors of the hospital and about 50 are outside the gate waiting . \nWe have some security to try and control things and if somebody comes in who is close to death we 'll take them in and treat them , otherwise , we 've worked out a system where we treat priority cases first . \nWe 're getting a lot of people coming here because they 've heard that this hospital is still standing . \nThere are people coming down from the villages . \nWe 've heard of three villages that were completely flattened not far from here . \nOne of these was a community of 2,000 people and every single house was destroyed . \nAnd people are coming up the mountain from the city too . \nYesterday a truck full of injured people arrived . \nBroken bones are the most common injuries The problem is that we 're beginning to run out of materials to treat broken bones , which is the most common injury we 're seeing . \nWe 're trying to ask some of the organizations at the airfield for help with supplies . \nThere 's no electricity either - we 're using a generator that works on diesel but this will last two days only . \nIn terms of injuries , we 're seeing lots of people with gangrene too - it 's not a pretty sight . \nIt 's the dry season now and there 's no supply of drinking water . \nI 'm a water engineer and I 'm meant to be setting up a filtering system today to create a more secure water supply . \nOur water will be for the hospital initially , and if we have more , we 'll hopefully be able to release some to the community . \nDavid Darg -LRB- left -RRB- with Eric Lotz from Operation Blessing Our emergency paramedic team arrived this morning from Israel . \nWe immediately coupled them with medicines and transported them into the heart of the quake zone and to the National hospital . \nSince that moment , the hospital has been inundated with patients with too few doctors to keep up with the influx of emergency cases . \nThe halls are filled with the groans of the untreated , the screams of those undergoing treatment and the stench of those who did n't make it . \nThe Israeli doctors were incredible ; they worked tirelessly and were extremely reluctant to leave with so many patients still waiting to be seen . \nBut we had to pull them back to the airport before nightfall because of the lack of security in downtown Port-au-Prince . \nThe National hospital in Port-au-Prince . \nPhoto : Tony Cece The airport is filling with more and more relief teams every day . \nThe relief camp looks like an Olympic village with national flags flying from nations all over the world . \nWe came across a soccer field with 2000 people camping in it , many of them sick or injured . \nThey only have one doctor between them , so we have agreed to visit the camp tomorrow and set up a clinic , provide some food and give out hygiene supplies . \n"}

{"id": "1316", "time": "2010-01-20", "text": "Thousands of survivors are fending for themselves Scores of US troops have landed at Haiti 's presidential palace , as aid efforts gather pace a week after the devastating earthquake . \nAid workers involved in the operation have been sharing their accounts with the BBC News website . \nEsitima , aged 12 , is recovering in hospital It has been a frantic day at the Baptist Haiti Mission Hospital where I am part of a multi-skilled team who arrived last Friday . \nThe hospital is one of the few which survived the earthquake . \nNews continues to spread that the hospital is open and that foreign doctors and surgeons are attending to patients . \nThe hospital remains extremely stretched and is having to make difficult decisions about both the living and the dead in terms of priorities . \nWe have had to dig a mass grave for patients who died and who have no family to collect the body - presumably the rest of the family perished in the earthquake . \nThe smell of death is in the air , something I have not ever really had to deal with before . \nIn terms of the living , we are having to make patients wait with what would normally be high priority injuries because there are others who arrive without warning in a critical condition . \nPeople say they are still pulling bodies out of the rubble , even after six days . \nA lorry arrived laden with fresh medical supplies just as the final cast on a broken leg was being completed The hospital has come close to running out of medical supplies , diesel for the generator and water . \nHowever it can only be described as miraculous how these needs are met at the last moment . \nA lorry arrived laden with fresh medical supplies just as the final cast on a broken leg was being completed . \nSomebody sourced some diesel as we ran the generator to keep the hospital functioning on its last gallons . \nAs the hospital was reporting that it was out of water , we got the emergency filtration unit running ! \nDespite all of this there are smiles of hope . \nA man grabbed me as I walked through the ward with my camera and insisted that I took a photo of his son who , after being operated on by the HCJB Global medical team , is going to live . \nWhilst still in the same ward a Haitian hospital chaplain led the patients in prayers and singing of hymns . \nIt was quite overwhelming to experience the sense of peace that descended on this ward in the midst of such tremendous suffering . \nEstima Yonel is another person with a big smile on his face . \nA 12 year old shepherd boy , Estima was walking back down the mountain with his herd of goats when the earthquake struck . \nBoulders tumbled down the mountainside and his leg and arm were crushed . \nThe surgeons worked late into the night to save him . \nHis brother and sister sit by his bedside with equally big white grins on their faces . \nI have just returned from Haiti , where I was delivering medical supplies , food and support for Relief International , and other institutions . \nI am heading back there tomorrow with more supplies . \nI 'm an information and communications technical consultant based in the Dominican Republic . \nLast Wednesday , after the earthquake , I decided to go to Haiti . \nI do n't work for an aid agency but I wanted to help . \nMy friends advised me against it , but I went ahead anyway . \nOnce word got out I was contacted by a someone who was trying to get a large trauma kit to Relief International doctors . \nThe kit includes basics such as bandages and dressings , something that was needed urgently in Haiti . \nOnce I set the ball rolling , things started to move quickly . \nWe managed to get the Infante Sano organization to pay for the kit , a group of students got a truck with driver for us , a friend bought supplies , tents and sleeping bags , and additional medical supplies , and a teacher offered his 4x4 Land Rover . \nWe were soon ready to go and help . \nWhen we got to Port-au-Prince we handed out our supplies to the Relief International doctors working in a field hospital . \nThey just used the bandages and dressing right in front of me . \nThey had no spare supplies at all . \nI watched as one doctor dressed a huge , five-day-old wound on a man 's head . \nI fetched more supplies from our truck and they were all used there and then . \nEven the most basic medical supplies are desperately needed . \nI knew that the film star Vin Diesel had frequently visited the Dominican Republic and Haiti . \nI decided to try and contact him to see if he could help . \nTo my surprise I got through and he wants to help . \nI am organising a meeting with him , meanwhile I 'm planning to go back to Haiti on Wednesday when I hope to take four doctors to Port-au-Prince . \nAid workers set up medical clinics and install clean water units For the third day in a row we have worked to treat victims in the Port-au-Prince soccer stadium . \nWhat started as an impromptu clinic has grown to become a field hospital where injured are kept overnight in tents . \nToday a group of French doctors joined the team allowing us to open 14 separate treatment stations . \nA truck with a PA system has been touring the downtown area encouraging the injured to come to the stadium for treatment and we have made announcements on the radio . \nOne of the Israeli doctors we are working with sighed in frustration today and told me he had never seen anything like this , none of us have . \nPatients that would normally be rushed to the emergency room were being turned away because there were others with more serious conditions . \nI saw a child with a broken back , she was paralysed and I could see her spine bulging outwards in one spot . \nShe was motionless except for her screaming . \nAnother little girl had lost her right ear and a considerable section of her scalp . \nWhile the doctors worked in the stadium I was in the national hospital . \nWe were responding to an urgent call the hospital made for clean water . \nThis is the largest hospital in Haiti and everywhere you look there are patients resting after treatment . \nA good proportion of the hospital was destroyed and now the patients are lying on old desks , blood-stained mattresses or even on the ground . \nWe were installing a water purification unit which can output 10,000 gallons of clean water per day . \nTomorrow we will be back at the hospital to finish the installation and get water pumping and our doctors will be back in action in the stadium . \nThe biggest challenge we are facing at the moment is the shortage of fuel . \nWe are having to ration the diesel we have and we are hoping this does n't restrict movement in the midst of great momentum on our relief effort . \nThe great news is that I just found out that Operation Blessing has a fuel supply on board a US Navy ship and that should be here in a few days along with tons of relief goods for distribution and 10 more of the water purification units like the one we installed today . \nIt 's raining quite hard now and the mosquitoes will be out soon , the rain will only worsen the already difficult living conditions for the scores of Haitians in tents across the quake zone . \nSarah Gillam : `` More food supplies will be picked up tonight for distribution tomorrow '' Yesterday ActionAid started the first of its distribution of emergency goods , delivering special emergency high protein meals to 2,750 children and enough medical supplies for about 250 wounded people . \nWorking with a local partner organization , the team took the supplies to four refugee camps , an impromptu field hospital and an ActionAid supported school in the Mariani district of Port-au-Prince . \nThe largest camp has 7,253 residents - all accounted for by volunteers working with us . \nThey 're living under makeshift tents made out of bedsheets and sticks but many have no covering at all . \nIn all the camps , voluntary committees have been set up by residents themselves to deal with food and water . \nThe risk of rape is very real for women in the camps - but thankfully at one camp I visited today volunteers have developed a system in which the most vulnerable women are guarded by volunteers at night . \nEvery afternoon a Haitian police officer visits the camp and residents turn in whoever has been accused of rape . \nThis has significantly lowered the risk and shows how the people of Haiti are taking their destiny into their own hands . \nMore food supplies will be picked up tonight for distribution tomorrow , a secure warehouse has been found , orders have been sent out for supplies , and we 've located a new office as ActionAid 's is now unsafe . \nStaff are working round the clock on funding applications across the world . \nInternet connection has been very poor and phone contact with the outside world intermittent . \nISABELLE JEANSON , MEDICINS SANS FRONTIERES Yesterday I visited Trinite Hospital . \nThere was a small baby , about one-and-a-half months old , lying on her side in her bed because her right arm had been amputated and was covered in bandages . \nIsabelle Jeanson : inside a therapeutic feeding center for malourished children The auxiliary nurse told me her story - sad and miraculous . \nShe was in the hospital when the earthquake partially destroyed it . \nSomehow this tiny little girl survived after falling through concrete floors and walls and was rescued from the rubble , though we have no idea where her mother is . \nChances are she does n't have a family anymore . \nSome people are now selling food in makeshift markets , and there is more traffic in the streets . \nThere 's also the regular sound of helicopters hovering . \nMore and more aid organizations are showing up and trucks and some cranes are steadily working through buildings in the city , though who knows how long it will take to dig through all the rubble to find those missing . \nA man with a gunshot wound was carried in on a stretcher . \nTwo doctors jumped into action , first checking to see if he was conscious , then seeing if he could feel his arms and legs . \nEven though the gunshot had punctured his neck they determined he was `` operable '' . \nThe patients we are treating will end up leaving our hospital as different people . \nMany must undergo amputations because their limbs are so badly crushed there 's no way of saving them . \nA colleague , who is on his fourth mission , told me he was amazed because he had no idea MSF had the capability to implement the human resources , the logistics , the setup that is required for this kind of emergency . \nMost amazingly though , is that everyone here , including our Haitian staff , are so singly focused these days on the one common intention : to save as many people as we can . \n"}

'' \nThe US Geological Survey said Wednesday 's tremor was centred 35 miles -LRB- 56km -RRB- north-west of the capital . \nIt struck at a depth of 6.2 miles -LRB- 9.9 km -RRB- , but was too far inland to generate any tsunamis in the Caribbean . \nWe were forced to buy a saw in the market to continue amputations Although some aid has started to reach desperate survivors , hundreds of thousands are still without food or water , a full week after the disaster . \nMedecins Sans Frontieres -LRB- Doctors Without Borders -RRB- said its cargo plane with 12 tonnes of medical supplies had been turned away from the congested Port-au-Prince airport three times since Sunday . \nIt said five patients died from lack of the supplies it carried . \n`` We were forced to buy a saw in the market to continue amputations , '' the group 's Loris de Filippi told the Reuters news agency in Cite Soleil . \nBut the US military has defended its efforts in the face of vast logistical challenges . \n`` We 're doing everything in our power to speed aid to Haiti as fast as humanly possible , '' said Gen Douglas Fraser , head of US Southern Command . \nHe said they plan to start using two other airports , at Jacmel in Haiti and San Isidro in the neighbouring Dominican Republic , in the coming days . \nOne full week after the magnitude seven quake devastated the country , search-and-rescue teams were emerging from the ruins with unbelievable success stories . \nEna Zizi , 69 , was rescued from the wreckage of the residence of Haiti 's Roman Catholic archbishop on Monday , a day before crews recovered the body of the archbishop himself , Monsignor Joseph Serge Miot . \nAnother survivor , 25-year-old Lozama Hotteline , was rescued from beneath a collapsed supermarket with the help of teams from Turkey and France . \nTelevision pictures showed her smiling and singing as she was carried to safety . \nThe United Nations said early on Wednesday that 121 people had been rescued by international teams since the 12 January earthquake - an extra 31 people on Tuesday . \nIn a bid to speed up the delivery of aid and stem looting and violence , US troops have stepped up their presence in the quake-ravaged country . \nMark Doyle , BBC News , Port-au-Prince Haiti was extremely poor even before the earthquake , and this disaster has now broken all the basic services , like phones and electricity . \nBut Haitians are resilient . \nEverywhere there are volunteers filling some of the gaps created by the slow arrival of international aid . \nA company which sells drinking water is distributing it free to people living in a school compound . \nA Haitian Jesuit priest has mobilised local relief workers and international doctors to work together in a rural region just outside the capital . \nIn a slum area , a volunteer first-aider dressed the wounds of a girl who had been trapped in rubble . \nThese largely unsung heroes know they ca n't replace the big foreign aid agencies , but they 're doing what they can to fill the gaps . \nUS Black Hawk helicopters swooped down on the grounds of Haiti 's wrecked presidential palace on Tuesday , dropping scores of US troops who moved to secure a nearby hospital and set up aid distribution points . \nUS Army Maj Gen Daniel Allyn , the deputy commander for relief operations in Haiti , said the military had delivered 400,000 bottles of water and 300,000 food rations since last Tuesday 's earthquake . \nHe said the number of US troops would grow to 10,000 in the coming weeks . \nMeanwhile , the UN Security Council voted to temporarily boost its peacekeeping forces by 3,500 personnel . \nUN officials said they would accompany US troops as they delivered supplies . \nWhile military escorts are still needed to deliver relief supplies , the United Nations said fears of violence and looting had eased . \n`` The overall security situation in Port-au-Prince remains stable , with limited , localized violence and looting occurring , '' the UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said . \nSo far , feared infectious diseases have not shown up , although many injured faced the immediate threats of tetanus and gangrene , and hospitals are overwhelmed . \nThe UN says `` localized looting '' is occurring , but overall security is good The Pentagon said a navy hospital ship , the USNS Comfort , had received its first Haitian patients , even as it was still heading towards Haiti . \nUS Defense Secretary Robert Gates said the military is sending additional ships to help with earthquake recovery in Haiti , including one that could remove debris blocking the main port . \nThe World Food Programme said it was planning to bring in 10,000 gallons -LRB- 40,000 litres -RRB- of diesel a day from the neighbouring Dominican Republic as Haitian fuel supplies dried up . \nHaitian officials say the death toll from the quake was likely to be between 100,000 and 200,000 , and that 75,000 bodies had already been buried in mass graves . \n"}

'' \nPeople in Haiti can send their message to text number 4636 or through the website The message is translated and formatted by a volunteer The volunteer asks for more information and verifies it Aid agencies can take this message directly and act on it Ushahidi made an agreement with local mobile phone operator Digicel and created a short code to which people could text their message . \nThat message is received by `` situation rooms '' set up in Boston and Washington . \nA third one will be set up in Geneva to provide 24-hour cover . \nAbout 10,000 Haitians have volunteered to translate messages from Creole to English and ask for more information if needed . \nOther volunteers and experts try to verify the information and put it into the map . \nThis is crowdsourcing on a big scale . \nPatrick Meier , director of crisis mapping at Ushahidi , told the BBC : `` We had a Skype chat between a volunteer here in Boston and someone on the tarmac of Port-au-Prince airport asking for GPS co-ordinates for the most obscure addresses . '' \nBut how do you get Haitians who do n't have access to the web to know about the map ? \nBy the most traditional media : radio . \nUshahidi worked with InSTEDD , an organization that helps humanitarian collaboration through technology innovation . \nThey visited local radio stations and tried to get the word around that Haitians could use the text short code 4636 to send their reports . \nThis is not the first crisis in which Ushahidi has operated . \nThe first map was created in the violent aftermath of the Kenyan elections in 2007 . \n`` We saw that it worked and thought that , if it worked in Africa , it would work elsewhere , '' said Mr Hersman . \nHaitians can report on the lack of water Organisations in the field can use the information and redirect help to those in need . \nInternet access , though , is an obstacle . \n`` We are collaborating with the map and making sure that the information is correct , '' said Karina Brisby , head of digital campaigns at Oxfam . \n`` But the lack of good internet access has n't allowed us access to the map , so we are relying on more traditional forms of information like the UN cluster system and satellite phones . \nThe map supplements that information . '' \nShe believes that because internet access is not widespread in Haiti , many rely on their mobile phones . \nShe thinks this is why mobile phones are crucial during a crisis and why some organizations worked around the clock to set up new mobile phone masts as soon as possible . \n`` We would n't get any help '' No one thought Jacmel was hit and , if we did n't do something for people to know , we simply would n't get any help at all Joel Dresse was in the US when the earthquake struck and traveled back to Haiti to rejoin his family and children . \nHe says he got the news from friends and relatives who were in Haiti by looking at Facebook , but added : `` Internet access is getting sporadic now . \nI will probably have to go to the Dominican Republic border to buy some diesel for our generator . '' \nFor the few who can use the web , social networks did become a good way to communicate . \nYael Talleyrand , a 16-year-old in Jacmel , Haiti , said she used Twitter to `` reassure people that some buildings were still up or that their family was okay '' . \n`` Also , no-one thought Jacmel was hit and if we did n't do something for people to know , we simply would n't get any help at all , '' she added . \n"}
