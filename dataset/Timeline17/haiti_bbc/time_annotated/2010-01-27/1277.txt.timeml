If the list of names does n't already give this Haiti charity single a touch of Band Aid , then the choice of location certainly does .
Cheryl Cole , Alexandra Burke , Mika , James Morrison and Susan Boyle have all passed through the doors of Trevor Horn 's Sarm Studios <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-W04">this week</TIMEX3> , headed for Studio 1 .
It 's the same studio that hosted Sir Bob Geldof and Midge Ure 's gang in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="1984">1984</TIMEX3> for the recording of Do
They Know It 's <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010-12-25">Christmas</TIMEX3> .
Sadly this time there 's no Bono , Sting and Simon Le Bon huddled together round the mic .
Instead each artist is coming in solo to sing a section of the REM classic Everybody Hurts .
This cover version is getting a similar treatment to the <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="1997">1997</TIMEX3> Children in Need take on Lou Reed 's Perfect Day , with each act being asked to record just one or two lines that will then get stitched together digitally to make a complete track .
Leona Lewis has scored the all important opening , laying down her vocals in a Los Angeles studio at <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2010-W03-WE">the weekend</TIMEX3> .
That 's where Robbie Williams and Take That will record their contributions <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2010-W04" mod="END">later this week</TIMEX3> , while Michael Buble 's voice has already been added from New York .
Over <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2010-W03-WE">the weekend</TIMEX3> JLS and Cheryl Cole passed through Studio 1 while on <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2010-01-25">Monday</TIMEX3> it was the turn of X Factor winners Joe McElderry and Alexandra Burke , who had flown in overnight from her European tour .
<TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2010-01-26">Tuesday</TIMEX3> began with Mika arriving fresh from France to sing .
He also gets to be like Phil Collins on Band Aid and play an instrument on the track , a ` ` New Orleans - style piano '' to round off the song , as Mika put it .
She was all pumped and ready to go .
She was cool , I leaned in to give her a kiss
but I do n't think she was too keen on giving me a kiss Even though the studio hire and engineering staff were coming free , each act still only got a 45 - minute time slot to nail their vocals .
Mika overran his allotted time so James Morrison had to wait a while , but he was fine as that meant he had time for a quick sarnie from round the corner .
James also had the added bonus of knowing the producer Steve Robson , so was ecstatic with his pre - selected lines .
` ` He -LRB- Steve -RRB- said that I 'd have the middle eight
and I was like , ` Wicked ! '
That 's one of the best bits in the song . ''
So that means James spent the afternoon trying to better Michael Stipe by belting out ` Do n't throw your hand ...
oh , no . . .
do n't throw your hand . '
By mid - afternoon on <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2010-01-26">Tuesday</TIMEX3> the artists at Sarm were starting to overlap , allowing James Morrison a rare Susan Boyle encounter .
` ` She was all pumped and ready to go , '' James said .
` ` She was cool , I leaned in to give her a kiss
but I do n't think she was too keen on giving me a kiss . ''
Hardly a ` ` feed the world '' group hug moment , but then again this recording was low key in comparison .
Each act came in one by one to stand at the single microphone in the voice booth in the middle of the relatively large studio , with that piano for Mika just off to one side .
James Morrison was joined by the likes of Rod Stewart and Alexandra Burke As for SuBo , she admitted she did n't know this REM song very well so had to learn her part from scratch .

But she thinks it 's a ` ` very nice song '' and admits ` ` it was an honor to be picked '' .
The day ended with Rod Stewart arriving to add his contribution after Simon Cowell called him personally , although more acts are expected to join in over the <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">coming days</TIMEX3> .
The video to accompany Everybody Hurts is being made simultaneously with the recording , so in another nod to Band Aid , expect to see a lot of artists at the mic wearing headphones as they sing along .
The estimated release date is <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2010-02-07">7 February</TIMEX3> , with proceeds going to the Disasters Emergency Committee -LRB- DEC -RRB-
and there 's already talk this could become one of the biggest selling singles of all time .
