Haiti 's biggest foreign investor is still standing .
The building housing Digicel , the Irish telecommunications firm with Caribbean roots , emerged unscathed from the earthquake from <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-01-12">the 12 January</TIMEX3> earthquake .
It has been reported that the 11 - storey structure was built to withstand huge tremors of the kind that that struck Port - au - Prince .
` ` Where the streets outside the building are <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> filled with chaos and desperation , inside the buzz of workers tapping away on keyboards fills the floors of Digicel 's offices , '' the AFP news agency said .
Cell phone operators have been working to get networks going again since the earthquake and to let those displaced by the quake contact loved ones in other countries .
Digicel is Haiti 's leading wireless operator with 2 million customers .
<TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-W03">Last week</TIMEX3> it said that about 70 % of its cell sites were working .
There is however still some congestion when making and receiving international calls .
Digicel , which began in Jamaica , found a very captive market when it set up in Haiti in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2006">2006</TIMEX3> .
The company says the operation cost $ 260 million and it remains a big employer , with nearly 900 people on its staff .
Fewer than one percent of Haitians have landlines , according to Digicel figures , so mobile phones are crucial for communications .
Irish telecoms billionaire Denis O'Brien , who founded Digicel , has said said he is working alongside former US president Bill Clinton on rebuilding Haiti .
` ` Obviously we need foreign direct investment but on a wider front we need a Marshall Plan , '' Mr O'Brien told AFP .
The company says it has yet to account for all of its employees , at least four of whom were killed in the quake .
But management is counting on having around 650 workers in the office by the end of the week .
Digicel also says it is working to provide material and psychological support to staff .
It has given each of its customers in Haiti the equivalent of $ 5 in free credit and has teamed up with Shaggy and other Caribbean singers to record a new song to raise money for earthquake survivors in Haiti .
