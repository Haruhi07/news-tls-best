Government and international officials in Haiti are drawing up a strategy to help rebuild the long - impoverished country , while continuing to provide emergency aid to the hundreds of thousands survivors left homeless .
We look at the short and long - term priorities .
The UN World Food Programme -LRB- WFP -RRB- has warned that while the relief effort in Haiti is beginning to gain its footing , providing food for more than two million people <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> represents the most complex task it has ever faced .
Relief agencies have tried to buy goods locally and regionally , but such efforts have been hampered because local markets affected by the earthquake have been slow to reopen , and Haiti 's subsistence farms have been unable to ramp up production .
This has forced the WFP to use nearly all of its stores of high - energy biscuits and nutrient - rich meals which do not require water .
Aid agencies will begin to distribute staple foods such as rice , beans , vegetable oil and salt - instead of just emergency ration packs - once cooking equipment has been distributed widely and safe water supplies have been established .
There is an acute shortage of drinking water in areas affected by the earthquake .
The water supply system , which before the disaster only provided 40 % of the population of Port - au - Prince with clean water , has effectively collapsed .
Massive quantities of bottled water have had to be flown into Haiti Aid agencies are shipping in massive quantities of bottled water and distributing water purification tablets .
Many people , however , have complained that they have received little , if any , of either .
The rapid response phase is expected to last <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P2M">two months</TIMEX3> and will need to be followed by longer - term activities , such as providing reliable water supplies for rebuilt homes and new settlements .
The main challenges are post - operative care and logistical support to the health facilities in terms of fuel and medical supplies , according to the UN humanitarian agency OCHA .
Haiti 's ministry of health and the World Health Organization -LRB- WHO -RRB- is revising its emergency response strategy and will gradually shift the focus from emergency surgical cases to primary health care .
` ` Priorities are changing , and there is more need for post - operative care and follow - up .
But there is still little capacity to help patients who need that follow - up care , '' WHO Director Dr Mirta Roses said on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-01-25">25 January</TIMEX3> .
Among the most urgent needs are those of thousands of Haitians who had amputations as a result of injuries .
` ` These people will need physical rehabilitation as well as mental health services .
That means more nursing and mental health personnel and more physical therapists , and of course the right equipment for these kinds of programs , '' said Dr Roses .
Among the most urgent cases are the thousands of Haitians who lost limbs Doctors fear many amputees will languish or even die without proper rehabilitation .
As the emergency phase of the disaster winds down , there is a pressing need for mobile and community - based clinics that can provide such services as maternity care , post - operative care , and treatment for chronic health problems including diabetes , heart disease , HIV , and tuberculosis , the WHO says .
Forty - three of the 59 hospitals , are <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> functioning , but they are having difficulty meeting the demand for health services , especially as the emergency medical personnel who arrived after the earthquake head home .
Also important is establishing surveillance networks to detect outbreaks of communicable diseases , a significant threat at the makeshift camps .
The International Organisation for Migration -LRB- IOM -RRB- says work is under way to improve the living conditions of the estimated 692,000 people in makeshift shelters in 591 camps in Port - au - Prince , until more durable solutions are found .
More than 235,000 people have taken advantage of the Haitian government 's offer of free transportation to cities in the north and south - west .
The IOM estimates that 100,000 family - sized tents are needed urgently Although the IOM had 10,000 tents stored in Haiti before the earthquake and has a further 30,000 abroad that will arrive soon , it says ` ` the supply is unlikely to address the extensive shelter needs '' .
The UN agency estimates that 100,000 family - sized tents are needed to house about 500,000 people , but the UN says up to one million require shelter .
Meanwhile , work has begun at the sites identified by the Haitian government for the establishment of organised tented settlements .
It is estimated that each settlement will accommodate up to 10,000 people .
However , tents can not be set up and displaced people relocated at the sites until they have water and sanitation facilities .
Tent settlements can only provide a short - term solution , officials say , particularly with the hurricane season expected to start around <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2009-06">June</TIMEX3> .
Haiti is likely to need billions of dollars to build new homes and government buildings in Port - au - Prince and the surrounding area , which were densely - populated before the earthquake .
Many of the buildings that collapsed were poorly designed and built - mostly with concrete and often without steel reinforcement and foundations .
There is a clear need for higher technical standards to be used during reconstruction .
Many of the buildings that collapsed were poorly designed and built
But Haiti 's government , along with many planning and architectural experts , have also called for a new strategy that will help Haiti build for the future , including reducing Port - au - Prince 's population density and replacing slums on unstable hillsides with homes that are safe , affordable and sustainable .
A new comprehensive building code that complies with international construction standards will be a priority .
Cletus Springer , the director of sustainable development at the Organisation of American States , said that for this to happen the authorities would have to work with the private sector and banks to help low - income families .
` ` Because of the poverty levels , not everybody 's going to be able to build to the exacting standards that a building code would require , '' he said .
In the short - term , the United Nations Human Settlements Programme -LRB- UN - Habitat -RRB- is carrying out a rapid structural damage estimate of buildings in the affected area .
Jean Yves Barcelo , the agency 's adviser in Haiti , hopes it will start planning for new settlements and at the neighborhood level within <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P1W">a week</TIMEX3> or two .
Experts warn that desperate residents of the poorer areas of Port - au - Prince may begin informal and unregulated reconstruction before a long - term reconstruction plan can be instigated .
The lack of investment in Haiti 's rural economy <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DURATION" value="P3DE" mod="MORE_THAN">over the past three decades</TIMEX3> has led to an average of 75,000 people moving to the capital , Port - au - Prince , <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="SET" value="P1Y" quant="EVERY">every year</TIMEX3> .
Since <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="1982">1982</TIMEX3> , the city 's population has grown from 750,000 to more than 2.5 million .
The rapid expansion was not planned and resulted in overcrowding , inadequate infrastructure , and the proliferation of slums containing scores of poorly - built homes , many of which were destroyed by the earthquake .
Haiti 's ambassador to the US envisages a smaller , better - built Port - au - Prince Key official buildings - the presidential palace , parliament building , police headquarters and 13 of the government 's 15 ministries - were also destroyed .
Many experts say that Port - au - Prince should be reduced in size when rebuilt , and Haiti 's economic and government activities decentralised .
Some have even suggested relocating the capital altogether .
Hundreds of thousands of people have already left the city for tented settlements or family homes in other parts of Haiti .
Many say they should be persuaded to stay .
Experts warn , however , that mass - relocation schemes after other disasters have usually failed because they isolate people from the jobs and economic opportunity that drew them to the city in the first place .

While the main airport in Port - au - Prince was not put out of action by the disaster , it was not equipped to deal with the volume of flights required by the relief effort .
The US military has taken over control of the airport To speed up the process , the US military took over control of the airport and 160 planes <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> are <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> able to land .
Aid flights are also coming into and out of the Dominican Republic and several other regional airports in Haiti .
Port - au - Prince 's main port was also badly damaged and other ports in the area could only accept smaller vessels .
One of the two piers in the capital 's docks was <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> reopened by the US Navy , allowing bulkier shipments to be delivered by sea .
At present , 150 containers can be unloaded <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> .
The transportation of aid by road continues to be hampered by piles of rubble and the volume of people trying to move out of or around the capital .

But the UN Development Programme -LRB- UNDP -RRB- has begun employing local people to clear roads .
Telephones and internet connections were down in many areas of Haiti for some time .
The situation has since improved , with emergency radios distributed and limited internet and phone capacity restored .
Experts say large - scale capital investment , led by the World Bank and the Inter - American Development Bank , will be needed to bring the road , electricity , water and telephone systems up to standard , and rebuild Port - au - Prince 's seaport and airport .
There has been concern about the security situation in Haiti , with fears that people not receiving aid would turn to violence .
US troops have been tasked with some security responsibilities In a bid to boost security and assist the relief effort , the UN Security Council is increasing the UN stabilisation mission in Haiti -LRB-
MINUSTAH -RRB-
by 3,500 troops to 12,651 .
Brazil plans to double its <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> contingent of 1,300 .
The EU is also deploying 150 officers of its new European Gendarmerie Force to assist the 3,500 - strong UN police force , UNPOL , and the Haitian Police Force -LRB- HNP -RRB- , which has , so far , managed to get half of its 8,000 officers back on the streets .
Meanwhile , the US has dispatched more than 15,000 military personnel to Haiti .
About 4,700 are deployed on the ground with the rest on ships off the coast .

The UN and US military have also set up a Joint Operations Tasking Centre to co - ordinate security in and around Port - au - Prince .
The US ambassador to Haiti , Ken Merten , says the rebuilding efforts have to focus on creating jobs and attracting investment to Haiti .
Without it , those displaced will need income support or food aid to survive for the foreseeable future .
The UN Development Programme has said that as part of the rebuilding strategy , it aims to temporarily employ 220,000 Haitians to work clearing debris and restoring basic infrastructure .
A long - term economic strategy prepared by the UN in <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3> that remains valid aimed to create 150,000 jobs <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DURATION" value="P2Y" mod="MORE_THAN">over two years</TIMEX3> by harnessing Haiti 's advantages in clothing manufacturing , tourism and agriculture .
International investors had launched a number of big projects before the earthquake and will be encouraged to stay .
Economists Paul Collier and Jean - Louis Warnholz , both of whom have experience in Haiti , say there is a need to relocate economic activity away from Port - au - Prince .
They propose that the construction of new homes be linked to the generation of new economic opportunities , in areas less prone to natural disasters .
This would require the expansion of secondary cities and agricultural modernisation .
` ` Done right , international intervention can deliver immediate jobs through construction , and longer - term jobs through new enterprises .
Done wrong , it will only pour relief into Port - au - Prince , luring in rural migrants from the impoverished central plateau , and further diminishing local food production at a time when it is most needed , '' they wrote in the Financial Times .
To guarantee effective management of the funding in a country where the government was overwhelmed before the earthquake , economists have proposed pooling money into a single ` ` Haiti Fund '' that can be used for development .
` ` It should receive emergency outlays from the United States and other donors ; organise a board that includes members appointed by Haitian President Rene Preval , the UN secretary general and donors ; and empower a management team to formulate and execute plans agreed to by the Haitian government , '' wrote Jeffrey Sachs , a leading development economist , in the Washington Post .
Mr Sachs estimates that annual donations of $ 2bn to $ 3bn will be required <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DURATION" value="P5Y" mod="MORE_THAN">over the next five years</TIMEX3> to cover urgent reconstruction costs and development financing .
The head of the International Monetary Fund , Dominique Strauss - Khan , has even gone so far as to call for a new ` ` Marshall Plan '' , which helped rebuild Europe after World War II , and warned against ` ` a piecemeal approach '' in Haiti .
One of the first steps in the transition from emergency relief into reconstruction and development is food security , and the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation -LRB- FAO -RRB- has warned that it is crucial that any damage to agricultural infrastructure must be repaired <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">as soon as possible</TIMEX3> .
FAO Director - General Jacques Diouf says famers must be given immediate support before <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="2010-SP">the spring</TIMEX3> planting season begins in <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="2010-03">March</TIMEX3> .
The season , which lasts until <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="2010-05">May</TIMEX3> , accounts for 60 % of Haiti 's national agricultural production .
<TIMEX3 tid="t36" type="DURATION" value="P20Y" mod="MORE_THAN">Over the past 20 years</TIMEX3> Haiti has become dependent on food imports , yet around 80 % of the population are involved in agriculture .
In the long term , officials hope to develop a rural agricultural strategy that would enable Haiti to become more self - sufficient .
At the <TIMEX3 tid="t37" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> donor conference in Montreal , the US and other nations made it clear that Haiti 's government had to lead the reconstruction effort .
The international community also reiterated its support for Haiti 's President , Rene Preval , and its Prime Minister , Jean - Max Bellerive .
Mr Preval , who was elected in <TIMEX3 tid="t38" type="DATE" value="2006">2006</TIMEX3> with broad popular support , initiated reforms of the police and judiciary with some success , according to Mark Schneider of the International Crisis Group .
His government was also able to forge a national consensus on a recovery plan following the devastating hurricanes of <TIMEX3 tid="t39" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> .
Nevertheless , the destruction of its ministries and deaths of hundreds of civil servants has meant the government has struggled to take control of the relief effort .
Survivors are growing increasingly frustrated by its perceived inaction .
