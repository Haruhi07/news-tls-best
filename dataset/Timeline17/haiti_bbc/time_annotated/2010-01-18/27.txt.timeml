French rescuers are among teams from many nations in Haiti The EU has pledged more than 400 m euros -LRB- # 354 m -RRB- in emergency aid for Haiti , as rescuers battle to help survivors of <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2010-W02">last week</TIMEX3> 's devastating earthquake .
The European Commission - the EU 's executive arm - will provide 137 m euros for short - term needs and at least 200 m euros for the medium and longer term .
The EU member states will provide an additional 92 m euros , officials said after emergency talks in Brussels .
Rescuers from EU nations are already working in devastated Port - au - Prince .
The Commission said the immediate priority had been to dispatch ` ` urban search and rescue teams '' , including military and civil engineering teams .
The EU may be most effective at coordinating medium and long - term development ` ` The <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> focus is to provide emergency health , water and sanitation , medical facilities , shelter , logistics , telecommunications and food . ''
EU ministers said the work required ` ` adequate security on the ground to ensure safe and unhindered access of aid deliveries '' .
The leading US general in Haiti , Lt Gen Ken Keen , says it is a ` ` reasonable assumption '' that up to 200,000 people may have died in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-01-12">last Tuesday</TIMEX3> 's earthquake .
Relief efforts are being slowed by bottlenecks , and many thousands of survivors are fending for themselves in the ruined capital Port - au - Prince and stricken areas around it .
The UN has launched an appeal for # 346 m intended to help three million people for <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P6M">six months</TIMEX3> , most of whom are thought to need emergency relief .
The British government is to triple its aid to Haiti to # 20 m .
