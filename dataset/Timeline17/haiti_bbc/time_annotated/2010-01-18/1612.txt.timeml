Haiti quake : Death toll may be 200,000 , US general says Haitians flock under US helicopter as it delivers aid supplies in Port - au - Prince The leading US general in Haiti has said it is a ` ` reasonable assumption '' that up to 200,000 people may have died in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-01-12">last Tuesday</TIMEX3> 's earthquake .
Lt Gen Ken Keen said the disaster was of ` ` epic proportions '' , but it was ` ` too early to know '' the full human cost .
Rescuers pulled more people alive from the rubble at <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010-W02-WE">the weekend</TIMEX3> , but at least 70,000 people have already had burials .
Relief efforts are being slowed by bottlenecks , and many thousands of survivors are fending for themselves .
Many Haitians are trying to leave the devastated capital city , Port - au - Prince , and there are security concerns amid reports of looting and violence .
Clearly , this is a disaster of epic proportions , and we ' ve got a lot of work ahead of us More than 2,000 US marines were expected to arrive in the region on <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-01-18">Monday</TIMEX3> to bolster US troops and UN peacekeepers already on the ground .
In Brussels , European Union nations pledged more than 420 m euros -LRB- $ 604 m ; # 320 m -RRB- from the EU budget to assist Haiti , with about half the sum dedicated to emergency and short - term aid .
At least 200 m euros will be dedicated to funding medium - to long - term rebuilding efforts .
` ` We recognize that more aid and support is needed , and more has been agreed , '' EU foreign affairs chief Catherine Ashton told reporters , adding that the EU was working closely with the United Nations , the US and others .
European ministers were also discussing deploying a security mission to help maintain law and order .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2010-01-18">Monday</TIMEX3> , UN Secretary General Ban Ki - moon said he would recommend that the UN Security Council boost police and troop numbers in Haiti by 3,500 .
It came <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> after he appealed to frustrated Haitians to be patient over efforts to bring them relief .
Gen Keen , running the US military relief effort , when asked about death toll estimates of between 150,000 and 200,000 people , said : ` ` I think the international community is looking at those figures , and I think that 's a start point .
` ` Clearly , this is a disaster of epic proportions , and we ' ve got a lot of work ahead of us . ''
Amid the chaos and destruction , a number of people were rescued from collapsed buildings at <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2010-W02-WE">the weekend</TIMEX3> .
Among the lucky ones was a seven - year - old girl pulled alive from the ruins of a supermarket .
Nick Davis , BBC News , Port - au - Prince I ' m standing on what would have been the roof of the city bank building .
There 's steel everywhere , the steel that was supposed to keep it upright .
<TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Right now</TIMEX3> the front of it 's just completely collapsed .
The rear of the building is still intact .
The job <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> is to see whether or not there are any more bodies still inside .
You ' ve got to bear in mind that this earthquake struck at a time when this place would have been full of people , full of staff members , full of cleaning crews , full of security and customers too .
Forensic teams who have flown in are using mitochondrial DNA samples to hopefully identify the bodies which they ' ve found .
But until this steel is cut , until the earth - moving equipment which is just to the other side of me can remove the tonnes of concrete I ' m standing on , not much can be done .
At the UN headquarters destroyed in the earthquake , rescuers lifted a Danish staff member alive from the ruins , just <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DURATION" value="PT15M">15 minutes</TIMEX3> after the secretary general visited the site .
And US teams with search dogs also rescued a 16 - year - old Dominican girl trapped for <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DURATION" value="P5D">five days</TIMEX3> in a small , three - storey hotel .

The US Agency for International Development -LRB- USAID -RRB- said on <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2010-01-18">Monday</TIMEX3> that American teams had pulled 10 people alive from the rubble the day before .
` ` According to rescue officials , this is the largest number of rescues in a single day in decades of earthquake search and rescue efforts , '' it said in a statement .
While hopes dim with every passing day , a South African rescue official , Colin Diner , told the BBC he hoped there would be more people found alive .
` ` What we are seeing is that the buildings have a whole lot of openings , collapsed voids and things , and that always gives you a better opportunity , '' he said .
UN humanitarian chief John Holmes told reporters on <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2010-01-18">Monday</TIMEX3> that there were <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> 43 search and rescue teams on the ground , with 1,700 people involved in the effort .
` ` More than 70 people have been pulled from the wreckage in <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DURATION" value="PXD">the last few days</TIMEX3> , '' he said , saying that efforts to find those trapped in the rubble would carry on until there was no longer hope of finding anyone alive .
He played down worries over security , saying that despite incidents of violence , the overall situation was one of calm .
Correspondents say there is a sense of movement at last with the relief effort , although the amount of supplies getting through is still small .
EU - $ 604 m -LRB- 420 m euros ; # 371 m -RRB- US - $ 100 m pledged in immediate aid , with promise of more later The BBC 's Mark Doyle says that in a slum community in the hills above Port - au - Prince , people have yet to see any government officials or aid workers .
They have camped out on waste ground and are fending for themselves , he says , pulling together to survive .
Meanwhile , our correspondent says , perhaps 5,000 people are lined up in the baking sun outside the US embassy , desperate to get visas to join relatives among the large Haitian - American community in the US .
Several agencies have complained about not being able to get aid through the airport in Port - au - Prince , which is heavily congested and has been taken over by the US military .
Medecins Sans Frontieres urged commanders to speed up the landing of planes carrying medical supplies , after one carrying an inflatable field hospital was turned away on <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="TIME" value="2010-01-16TNI">Saturday night</TIMEX3> .

But Mr Holmes said that initial issues were <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> being resolved with the introduction through the World Food program of a slot system to prioritise humanitarian flights .
The head of the US operation at the airport , Col Buck Elton , said on <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="2010-01-17">Sunday</TIMEX3> there had been 600 take - offs and landings since the US took control on <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="2010-01-13">Wednesday</TIMEX3> , and 50 flights had been diverted .
About 60 % of the flights coming in were civilian and 40 % military , he said .
US troops also said they had set up their first foothold outside the airport to deliver aid carried in by helicopters .
Port - au - Prince 's port is badly damaged , and many roads are still blocked by corpses and debris , hampering the delivery of fuel and other supplies .
The Haitian and Dominican Republic governments are planning an alternative 130 km -LRB- 80 mile -RRB- humanitarian road corridor to deliver relief from the southern Dominican town of Barahona , the UN said .
Mr Holmes said the UN expected to resolve problems with bringing in fuel from the Dominican Republic in <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="2010-01-19">the next day</TIMEX3> or two .
The UN has launched an appeal for $ 562 m -LRB- # 346 m -RRB- intended to help three million people for <TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="DURATION" value="P6M">six months</TIMEX3> , most of whom are thought to need emergency relief .
The British government has said it will treble its aid to Haiti to # 20 m -LRB- $ 32 m -RRB- .
