Rescuers say determination is key to survival when trapped Rescue efforts have been declared officially over in Haiti , <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P11D">11 days</TIMEX3> after the earthquake .
The BBC 's Anna Jones examines how people survive in the rubble - and what dictates the duration of search operations .
The UN usually decides to call off search and rescue attempts between <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P5D">five</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P7D">seven days</TIMEX3> after a disaster , once no - one has been saved for <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> or two - but people have been known to survive for much longer .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="1995">1995</TIMEX3> , Park Seung Hyun was pulled from the wreckage of a collapsed supermarket in Seoul , South Korea , <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="P16D">16 days</TIMEX3> after it collapsed and in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2004-01">January 2004</TIMEX3> , Shahr - Banu Mazandarani , an Iranian woman in her 90s was rescued after <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="P9D">nine days</TIMEX3> buried in the rubble of her home after the Bam earthquake .
In one extraordinary case in <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2005-12">December 2005</TIMEX3> , a 40 - year - old woman was found buried in what had been her kitchen in Pakistan - administered Kashmir , <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="P2M" mod="MORE_THAN">more than two months</TIMEX3> after an earthquake hit the region .
Doctors said it was a miracle that Naqsha Bibi had survived so long in a space so small she could not move .
Julie Ryan , a co - ordinator with UK - based group International Rescue Committee -LRB- IRC -RRB- , says that survival largely depends on what happens the moment the quake first hits .
` ` The ideal situation is you have become trapped and entombed but have some sort of oxygen supply from the outside world , are not injured and also have some sort of access to water , '' she told the BBC .
` ` You have usually managed to get yourselves into some sort of void where you are enclosed by the building but it does n't injure you . ''
She said an IRC team rescued three boys who had been buried in the ruins of their school for <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DURATION" value="P5D">five days</TIMEX3> after the earthquake in Pakistan in <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2005">2005</TIMEX3> .
` ` They were laid flat on backs next to each other , with the ceiling touching their noses but totally unhurt , '' she said .
Another boy alongside them had died .
After so long in the dark , rescue teams had to cover the boys ' eyes as they pulled them out , to protect them from the strong sunlight .
Dr Tejsrhi Shah of Medecins Sans Frontieres says many of those injured in earthquakes are so badly hurt they would not reach medical care .

But she says that if people are trapped , ` ` just the immobility will reduce your chance of survival '' .
Being unable to move or having injuries to limbs can lead to crush syndrome , she says , where blood flow to the limbs is disrupted .
When the crush is removed , a build - up of toxins floods the body and it is unable to cope .
Mazandarani spent <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DURATION" value="P9D">nine days</TIMEX3> in the rubble of her home ` ` It causes renal damage and shock , people are in agony with the pain and have a high risk of developing renal failure if do n't get urgent medical care , '' she said .
Dr Shah says there are reports of people surviving in rubble even <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DURATION" value="P2W" mod="MORE_THAN">longer than two weeks</TIMEX3> , but such cases are ` ` incredibly rare '' .
` ` The chances of getting someone out alive decreases with <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EACH">each day</TIMEX3> , '' she says .
Being trapped in a confined space also means a rising temperature and an increase in carbon dioxide , which , if it reaches too high a level , leads to suffocation .
Search teams monitor for rising levels of CO2 in a building - a rise means someone is trapped inside and breathing .
When CO2 levels stop rising , the search is no longer needed .
Graham Payne , chairman and founder of rescue charity Rapid , told the BBC trapped people could go quiet for hours at a time if they passed out or fell asleep but teams never gave up on them .
` ` You think you ' ve lost them but you carry on .
It might be another <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DURATION" value="PT8H">eight hours</TIMEX3> , then they start making noise again .
` ` But if they 're trapped and we can hear , then we get them out , we do n't give up . ''
If you are uninjured , have an air supply and are in an adequate space - however small - the next priority is water .
Dr Shah says estimating how long people can survive without water is the ` ` million dollar question '' , but that the average is between <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DURATION" value="P3D">three</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DURATION" value="P7D">seven days</TIMEX3> .
` ` It depends on the ambient temperature , how much fluid you 're losing through sweat , if you have diarrhoea , how healthy you are , how old you are , '' she says .
A few fortunate people may find themselves trapped with a clean supply but others will find a trickle of rainwater , condensation or even use water from inside radiators .
Following the South Korean supermarket collapse , IRC rescued a man who had been trapped for <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DURATION" value="P13D">13 days</TIMEX3> - he had been drinking drops of rainwater and eating cardboard lying around him to stave off hunger .
Some of those rescued in Haiti have spoken of being encouraged by hearing voices around them .

But Ms Ryan says that as time goes on , knowing other people are trapped can be more upsetting than comforting .
` ` The man trapped in Korea was initially lying with quite a few people but one by one they all stopped talking .
So psychologically , it does n't do any good . ''
She says the best thing buried survivors can do is stay calm and listen , however hard that may be .
` ` We use sound location equipment to look for survivors , which picks up tapping .
If you hear tapping , tap back , or shout , '' she says .
But despite the best preparation and advice , rescuers say survival often comes down to ` ` sheer determination '' .
` ` It 's the will , '' says Mr Payne .
` ` Some people just accept they are trapped and it 's fate .
Others just keep going . ''
