Rescuers could hear knocking and finally managed to free the trapped man A 24 - year - old man has been rescued alive from the rubble of a ruined hotel in Haiti 's capital , Port - au - Prince , <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P11D">11 days</TIMEX3> after the earthquake .
It came hours after Haiti 's government declared a formal end to the search for survivors .
Onlookers cheered as Wismond Exantus - smiling and apparently in a good condition - emerged on a stretcher from what remains of the Napoli Inn Hotel .
He later told reporters that soft drinks and snacks had kept him going .
It took two - and - a - half hours for the rescue of Wismond Exantus to take place .
It might never have happened , had not a member of his family approached a Greek journalist on the street and said they had heard noises coming from underneath a building .
The Greek journalist said he also heard the noises , and approached a Greek rescue team .
They then went into operation in combination with French and American teams , and pulled the man free from the rubble .
As he was gingerly put on a stretcher and carried towards a waiting ambulance , Wismond Exantus smiled .
He did n't say anything
but he was , if not totally unharmed , clearly in a very good state of health .
` ` I survived by drinking Coca - Cola and I ate some little tiny things , '' Mr Enso , who worked in the hotel 's grocery store , told news agency AFP from his bed in a French field hospital .
` ` Every night I thought about the revelation that I would survive , '' he was quoted as saying by the Associated Press agency .
French medic Gilles Gueney said : ` ` It 's amazing but he has no fractures , no broken bones .
He 's very dehydrated and is <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> on a drip . ''
He added that Wismond Exantus was expected to be out of hospital ` ` in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> or two '' .
Greek , French and US rescue teams were involved in the two - and - a - half - hour operation to bring him out of the remains of the hotel .

A French rescue worker , Lt Col Christophe Renou , described his survival as ` ` a miracle '' .
He said rescuers - who had been alerted by the man 's family - had managed to get water to him while they worked to dig him out .
Lt Col Renou said the man had probably been helped by the fact that the 5 - 6 m -LRB- 16 - 20 ft -RRB- of debris above him was largely wood , rather than concrete .
He said the man had told his rescuers that another four people were trapped with him but that they had stopped moving <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">a couple of days earlier</TIMEX3> .
The BBC 's Adam Mynott , in Port - au - Prince , says some Haitians have questioned the announcement that search - and - rescue operations are to end - and the discovery of Wismond Exantus will have lent weight to their argument .
Speaking before Mr Enso 's rescue , UN spokeswoman Elizabeth Byrs in Geneva said the decision to end the search for survivors was ` ` heartbreaking '' but that it had been taken on the advice of experts .

Two people , an 84 - year - old woman and a 21 - year - old man , were pulled alive from the rubble in Port - au - Prince on <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2010-01-22">Friday</TIMEX3> .
The woman , who was found in the wreckage of her home seriously injured and severely dehydrated , was taken to the main city hospital for treatment .
The 21 - year - old man , Emmannuel Buso , was rescued by an Israeli search team and is said to be in a stable condition .
Speaking from his hospital bed , he described how he had had no food , and had drunk his own urine to keep thirst at bay .
An estimated 1.5 million people were left homeless by the 7.0 - magnitude quake , which some have estimated has killed as many as 200,000 people .
At least 75,000 bodies have so far been buried in mass graves , Haiti 's government has said .
Many more remain uncollected in the streets .
The UN says 130,000 people have <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> been relocated out of Port - au - Prince , easing the pressure on overcrowded camps in the city .
