Haiti earthquake : Your stories <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-01-21">Thursday</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-01-14">14 January</TIMEX3> Up to 10,000 US troops will be on the ground or off the coast of Haiti by <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-01-18">Monday</TIMEX3> to help deal with the earthquake aid effort , US defense officials have said .
BBC News website readers around the world have been talking to the BBC about their search for missing friends and relatives .
Here are some of their stories .
We are desperately worried because my uncle Pierre Celestin and six of his children are missing in Port - au - Prince .
The area is devastated .
The church and graveyard where my grandfather is buried has been destroyed and I am stuck here thousands of miles away .
I feel so frustrated , all I want to do is to jump on a plane and go to help I feel so frustrated , all I want to do is to jump on a plane and go to help .
I have several family members in New York , and they are not coping well .
My aunt is going out with the Red Cross to help , and hopefully find them .
We have to believe that my uncle and as his sons are still alive .
I ' ve been constantly trying to phone through to Haiti .
I am doing everything I can to try to gather information - I ' m on Facebook and Twitter all the time .
Someone , somewhere must know something about them .
When the earthquake struck I felt so alone as there are so few Haitians here in Britain .
I have joined the group United Haitians in the UK .
We hope to raise funds and help in any way we can .
I just want to appeal to anyone in this country to give any help you can .
My husband is from Haiti and has a large family that live in Carrefour , on the edge of the capital Port - au - Prince .
It must be a miracle because although the houses around them are broken , all eleven of his relatives are still alive and uninjured and their house is ok too .
We feared the worst when we saw the pictures on the news .
It was <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="TIME" value="2010-01-18T03:00">3 am</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-01-14">yesterday</TIMEX3> when we heard .
We did n't get much sleep after that .
All the reports from Carrefour were of houses that had been flattened .
The place had been ` ` levelled '' .
All I can say to people is do n't give up hope just yet We tried to get through to the family .
The phone lines were down , the internet was down .
It was just a case of constantly trying , but we could n't get through at all .
Getting through the day was difficult .
All we could do was watch TV and look out for people we knew .
When I got home at nine o'clock <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="TIME" value="2010-01-14TNI">last night</TIMEX3> I finally heard the good news .
My husband got through to his younger brother on the phone .
He said : ` ` We 're fine - in fact none of us have a scratch . ''
Eleven members of the family were in the house at the time of the earthquake .
But they all survived .
And the house is intact .
Even though everything was in tatters around them .
All I can say to people is do n't give up hope just yet because among the darkness sometimes there is a small glimmer of light .
I hope more families will have good fortune like we have .
Earthquake damage in Haiti .
Picture : Eric Lotz , Operation Blessing My partner and I are US citizens who have been helping in the triage areas of the main UN base near the Toussaint L'Ouverture airport since the night of the quake .
We are civilians and are still waiting to hear word back from officials in the US Embassy about evacuations .
Until then , we 're here comforting families and children and doing whatever we can to help the incoming victims .
The UN is supposed to begin building a new mobile hospital <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-01-15">today</TIMEX3> .
Around 2,000 US marines are supposed to land as well .
The UN has already sent out wounded foreign nationals to hospitals in Miami , along with very badly wounded Haitians .
Two Haitian girls are waiting for foot amputations sometime <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010-01-15">today</TIMEX3> .
Our passports , computers , clothes and medicine are all buried in the house we were staying at in Port - au - Prince .
All that we have with us <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> are the clothes on our backs .
We were talking with friends in an adjacent neighborhood when the quake hit .
We immediately walked back to our friends ' house to find that that everyone was mercifully OK .
Afterwards , we began rounding up all the wounded from the surrounding neighborhoods and put them all in one area .
We gathered together more than 200 wounded and the message kept spreading .
Tremors still shake everyone in the compound and make it especially difficult to get any sleep at night .
These past <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P2D">two days</TIMEX3> have been a nightmare , especially for the countless Haitians who have lost everything .
BARBARA JONES , MILTON KEYNES , UK I am Haitian and have lived in the UK for just <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P8M">eight months</TIMEX3> .
I was working and living in the Dominican Republic before then and if I was there <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> , I would have run across the border to find out what has happened to my family .
To see how the whole world is responding is amazing
I have not heard from my mother or my cousins .
My aunt is also missing .
She gave me my education
and I owe her so much , she was a huge part of my childhood .
My family live in Port - au - Prince , right at the epicentre of the earthquake .
I have n't heard from any of them .
I have been calling all my other relatives and friends in Haiti .
The phone lines are down a lot of the time and I ca n't get through .
I am relying on family in America as well .
I am <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> married and my husband has been wonderful .
He has been supporting me otherwise I would be feeling very alone .
Haitians , we are used to disaster but this is the worse thing that has ever happened .
It is so upsetting .
Haiti 's government can not respond to something on this scale .
To see how the whole world is responding is amazing .
I am close to tears when I see how everyone is coming to help us .
Sebastien Barrau and Marvin Chery I am from Haiti and I moved to Miami <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2006">four years ago</TIMEX3> .
My family is still there .
I got a call from my sister asking me to call her back straight away , she mentioned something about an earthquake .
I did n't think it was that bad .
When I got off the phone to her , I checked Twitter and I could see everybody posting information on there .
I started to get really worried for friends and family but it was my first day at a new job
so I felt I could n't just get up and leave .
It was so terrible seeing the images on the television and online .
Places I know and have visited were just destroyed .
Haiti has had a lot of problems but nothing like this .
It 's so shocking to see how everything has been destroyed and I just want to go back and help .
I ca n't though
and so I decided to create a website to help .
I had a lot of people on Twitter contacting me , asking for information about loved ones .
I thought it would make sense to get a website together where people can put up pictures and appeal for information about missing people .
Everybody is worried and the list makes it easier .
My school friend from Haiti , Marvin Chery , and I put the website together and it 's <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> live .
I ' m really disappointed .
There are so few survivors .
I spoke to a friend who helped get five people out of a collapsed supermarket , just five people .
I ' ve heard about people being alive <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="P1D">one day</TIMEX3> and stuck under the rubble but who do n't make it .
