As it happened : Haiti earthquake <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2010-01-15">15 Jan</TIMEX3> Live coverage following <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-01-12">Tuesday</TIMEX3> 's earthquake in Haiti , in which tens of thousands are feared to have been killed and some three million displaced .

The BBC 's Andy Gallagher in Port - au - Prince says : ` ` The airport is <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> busier than ever .
But even as the plans land , and the supplies are unloaded , there are major problems distributing the aid .
Much of it remains on the runway - tents , blankets and medical supplies sitting unused .
Military personnel told me the logistical complexity of working out of such a tiny airport is a major stumbling block .
But the fact remains that very little aid has reached those who need it .
In the city itself , I have seen the UN handing out supplies .
But it is the injured and dying who require most help .
Haiti has <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> handed over control of the airport to the US , a move that could finally speed up the relief effort . ''
<TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2255">2255</TIMEX3>
Lord Malloch Brown , the former UN deputy secretary general , tells the BBC that the rescue effort has been damaged by the loss of much of the UN team in Haiti , but that it is well - placed to recover quickly .
` ` Obviously any organization which so tragically has its leadership decapitated is in chaos for a bit .
But in fact the UN is much bigger in Port - au - Prince than it is in most places in the world because of the big peacekeeping operation there .
The UN is in a better place to regroup and recover than would be the case in many parts of the world where natural disasters strike and the UN has almost no presence .

But I think the really big factor here is the proximity to the US , which is able to project by far the most capable logistics operations in crises like this , '' he says .
<TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2237">2237</TIMEX3> US Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano says undocumented Haitians in the United States will be granted ` ` temporary protected status '' , which will allow those eligible to continue living and working there for <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P18M">the next 18 months</TIMEX3> .
There are an estimated 30,000 Haitians living illegally in the US .

<TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2228">2228</TIMEX3> UK International Development Secretary Douglas Alexander tells the BBC those involved in the aid operation are working against the clock .
` ` We are acutely aware that at this stage in the crisis every hour matters - that 's why we have our British firefighters on the ground already , trying to save lives .
We 'll be working round the clock to make sure not just that we save lives , but we tend to the needs of those who have been left devastated by this terrible earthquake . ''
<TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2224">2224</TIMEX3> US pop star Madonna announces she will donate $ 250,000 to to assist Haiti 's earthquake victims through the charity , Partners in Health .

The BBC 's Matthew Price in Port - au - Prince says : ` ` I have been standing outside a nursing college in the capital for <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="PTXH">several hours</TIMEX3> .
One desperate woman , who is part of the management team , has told me that inside the remains of the college , which used to be five storeys high , there are 260 dead bodies and 25 people still alive , even after <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DURATION" value="P3D">three days</TIMEX3> .
She says the principal has received a text message from inside to that effect .
A Brazilian rescue team has been trying to get access to them , but progress has been very slow .
The several hundred locals gathered nearby are getting increasing alarmed . ''
2208The BBC 's Nick Davis in Port - au - Prince says : ` ` On one of the main roads from the airport into the city , you would expect to see convoys of trucks carrying aid .
But there are n't any .
A logjam at the airport caused by the logistical nightmare of the earthquake , and the poor infrastructure that existed before <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2010-01-12">Tuesday</TIMEX3> , makes getting the help where it is needed almost impossible .
At one cemetery nearby , bodies have been turning up all day .
The hope is the urgent supplies will arrive before more die . ''

A shorter flying time has been made possible by an agreement with Cuba allowing US relief flights to use Cuban air space .
` ` When the supplies do start to rolling in , we 'll have our procedures in order , and we 'll be able to more efficiently deliver the relief , '' he says .
2156 Apparent delays in aid reaching survivors have prompted anger across Haiti , and there have been reports of looting .

But Ian Rodgers of Save the Children says its teams in Port - au - Prince have not seen any evidence of crime .
` ` As we move through areas , people are desperately expressing what their needs are , and calling for assistance .
But the population is still at this point being very , very supportive , '' he tells the BBC .

At present , there are 4,200 US military personnel in Haiti , or are involved in the relief effort , and thousands more will arrive <TIMEX3 tid="t38" type="DATE" value="2010-W03">next week</TIMEX3> , he says .
In the meantime , the US is looking at the possibility of establishing a support base in the Dominican Republic , so supplies can be brought in by land , he adds .

Following lessons learned from the <TIMEX3 tid="t41" type="DATE" value="2004">2004</TIMEX3> Asian tsunami , recovery teams will only be able to take snapshots of the dead before the bodies decay and snip pieces of clothing to show relatives .

The BBC 's Matt Frei in Port - au - Prince says : The evidence so far suggests that Port - au - Prince is a city left to its very own meager resources .
The patients of the general hospital have spilled into the open spaces around it .
Dozens of people are slowly dying while their relatives try to keep them alive with water or aspirin , or anything else they can get their hands on .
Shade is their only luxury here .
During our <TIMEX3 tid="t50" type="DURATION" value="PT1H">one hour</TIMEX3> visit , we saw not a single doctor or nurse .
And all the time you can hear the US military helicopters overhead and aid planes landing .
The airport is slowly filling up , the city needs all the help it can get and time could not be more scarce .

` We 're looking for drinks and food - we do n't have any , ' one man told me .
In places , some help is beginning to appear .
But elsewhere the desperation is beginning to show .
Some fought as they searched for food at one supermarket .
On the ground , people are just not seeing any of the aid .
People are having to help themselves , getting any belongings they can out of their houses .
This is a resourceful country , used to dealing with disaster , but it can not cope alone . ''
Survivors dig with their bare hands , looking for food and water <TIMEX3 tid="t58" type="DATE" value="1828">1828</TIMEX3> US Agency for International Development -LRB- USAID -RRB- administrator Rajiv Shah says there is still an important ` ` rescue element '' to the relief operation in Haiti .
` ` Our belief is <TIMEX3 tid="t59" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> that there is a significant urban search and rescue effort underway and it is still attempting to save lives .
There is still an important open window of time <TIMEX3 tid="t60" type="DATE" value="2010-01-15">today</TIMEX3> , <TIMEX3 tid="t62" type="TIME" value="2010-01-15TNI">tonight</TIMEX3> and perhaps even parts of <TIMEX3 tid="t61" type="DATE" value="2010-01-16">tomorrow</TIMEX3> when we have ability to save lives ; Haitian lives , American lives and the lives of partner governments and people that are there on the ground , '' he says .

The BBC 's George Alagiah in Port - au - Prince says : ` ` I ' ve been out on the streets <TIMEX3 tid="t67" type="TIME" value="2010-01-15TMO">this morning</TIMEX3> and I sense a change in mood .
The resignation and fear that was there in the immediate hours after the tragedy is <TIMEX3 tid="t68" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> changing into frustration and even anger .
The aid is beginning to get through , but it is not yet reaching those who need it most .
So many of the injured remain untreated , and many of the dead remain unburied . ''

I said I could n't help . ''

Rear Adm Victor Guillery , the man overseeing the US Navy 's operations in Haiti , tells the BBC that the aircraft carrier , USS Carl Vinson , will effectively act as a ` ` sea base '' outside Port - au - Prince .
` ` Essentially , it allows for the staging of helicopters , supplies and to be responsive to the needs ashore .
So , while there is a tremendous amount of effort to complete a port survey and to open a port to allow a greater amount of supplies to come across the pier to the effort , initially much of the work will be done by air , '' he says .

They do n't have the infrastructure that they would have had ?
The priority is to be able to set up surgical facilities that can answer to the acute needs of this population , '' he says .
