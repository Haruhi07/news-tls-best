On the ground in Haiti with survivors as they desperately plead for help ` ` People are sleeping everywhere because they are too afraid to stay inside their houses . ''
That is the news from relief worker Sarah Dellor , who is stationed in Haiti providing aid after the earthquake which hit on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-01-12">12 January</TIMEX3> .
` ` The critical needs are food , water and fuel .
People are sleeping out in the open , '' she told BBC Radio Berkshire .
Sarah is stationed in the capital Port - au - Prince with the charity Tearfund .
` ` Tents still need to come through .
In a nearby church garden , 125 orphans from a orphanage nearby are staying on the grass , in cots still out in the open , although tents did arrive <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-01-21">yesterday</TIMEX3> . ''
Sarah is the East and Central Africa disaster management officer for Tearfund - a relief and development charity - which sent a team out to Haiti on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-01-17">17 January</TIMEX3> .
The Red Cross estimates that up to 50,000 people were killed and three million people affected by the earthquake , which hit 7.0 on the Richter Scale .
Sarah was in Haiti on <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-01-20">20 January</TIMEX3> when an aftershock hit , measuring 6.1 on the Richter Scale .
` ` It was at <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="TIME" value="2010-01-20T06:00">6 am</TIMEX3> in the morning so most people were still asleep , '' Sarah said .
` ` We were sleeping in tents and it was pretty scary because it was our first night here .
` ` To get woken up , when you 're still asleep , it takes <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="PTXS">a couple of seconds</TIMEX3> to register what is happening .
` ` There was an awful lot of noise because people were screaming - we just tried to get out of our tents quick enough to be safe .
` ` Fortunately where we are staying , there are not many buildings around .
We were fairly safe .
Many people live in poorly constructed houses on hills in Haiti ` ` It was quite quick , <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="PT10S" mod="APPROX">about 10 seconds</TIMEX3> .
You could see the trauma of people .
You could see the panic .
` ` Obviously people who had experienced the big earthquake <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2010-W02">last week</TIMEX3> - all the trauma comes flooding back .
There were real moments of panic .
` ` More buildings collapsed as well and I heard of an orphanage nearby where hundreds of children died <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2010-01-21">yesterday</TIMEX3> .
` ` The structures which had become unsafe in the big earthquake were so fragile , <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> further damage has been done . ''
Sarah , who is from the west Berkshire village of Woolhampton , has been in earthquakes in Indonesia during the Tsunami , but said the tremors in Haiti were still scary .
` ` I immediately knew what it was so I could quickly get out .
But it was pretty scary .
<TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="TIME" value="2010-01-21TNI">Last night</TIMEX3> there were several small tremors .
` ` I was awake quite a lot <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="TIME" value="2010-01-21TNI">last night</TIMEX3> anyway because there were quite a lot of gun shots , the noise of the helicopters and planes going over and just because everyone is sleeping outside there is so much noise . ''
Sarah explained that many people in Haiti were frightened and panicked .
` ` Fear is the big thing in terms of aftershocks .
People are too scared to go back in the houses and because the houses are unstable anyway , it 's good they are not sleeping inside , but the trauma of the earthquake is there and the panic which so immediately sets in , is horrible . ''
The lack of basic amenities is still a big problem and aid is still very much needed .
` ` Food and water are still a big priority and fuel is hampering all operations because they are trying to get it to the people , '' Sarah said .
The Red Cross estimates that up to 50,000 have been killed ` ` Once we can get some fuel then that 's going to help the situation enormously .
` ` Tents are a big issue .
It has n't rained here since the earthquake which is amazing because it normally does rain here .
` ` There are about one million to 1.5 million people sleeping outside at the moment , if it rains , the situation is just going to be another disaster because of the spread of disease .
` ` There 's so much rubbish on the streets and obviously there is no sanitation at all , so if it rains , the sanitation situation is going to deteriorate very quickly . ''
