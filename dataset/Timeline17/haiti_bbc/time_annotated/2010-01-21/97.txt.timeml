Marathon music event to help Haiti earthquake appeal A Haitian woman is helped from the rubble of a damaged building A host of top names from the Northern Ireland entertainment industry are set to take part in a marathon music event in aid of the Haiti earthquake appeal .
Over fifty acts , including The Answer , David Holmes , General Fiasco and the Beat Poets will perform at the Belfast gig in Katy Daly 's on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-01-31">31st January</TIMEX3> .
The ` ` Belfast 4 Haiti '' event has been promoted almost exclusively through the networking sites Facebook and Twitter .
The campaign 's Facebook page has so far attracted over 4,500 members .
One of the organisers , Aaron Abernethy , said they originally had a target of # 20,000 , but given the amount of interest he said they <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> hope to exceed that figure .
He explained that the idea for the fundraiser came during a conversation with other musicians on the internet .
` ` It all started <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-W02">last week</TIMEX3> when all the Haiti news reports came out and a few of us , local musicians , were musing on a web board , ` should there be a benefit gig for this ? '
and it kind of snowballed from there .
` ` Two of us got elected , as it were , to try and run these things , '' he said .
Mr Abernethy also said that as he had been made redundant <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-W01">two weeks ago</TIMEX3> , he had found plenty of spare time to get involved in the organization .
He said David Holmes , the local DJ who received an Oscar nomination for his music in the Oceans 11 film , would play in the Stiff Kitten venue , close to the main event .
` ` We ' ve also got The Answer playing at our gig in the Limelight , who have just come back from a worldwide tour with AC\/DC where they played to literally millions of people '' .
` ` Also , General Fiasco who are a young band who are getting lots of play on MTV at the minute ; In Case of Fire , from Portadown , who are always on all the music magazines at the minute .
` ` There are just so many of the biggest names in Northern Ireland basically who have all been very kind to offer to play , its just been fantastic , '' he said .
