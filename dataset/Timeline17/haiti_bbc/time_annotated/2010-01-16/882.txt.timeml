I was in the mountains , in a suburb of Port - au - Prince when the earthquake happened .
Once I realized what the magnitude is , I went straight down to the city .
The further I got , the worst things got .
<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Right now</TIMEX3> everyone is waiting for help , looking for fuel , food and water .
We did not expect such a tragedy , so nobody has got any supplies .
There are no shops open and people do n't know what to do .
The security situation is becoming a problem too .
Streets can get very violent and you have to be careful .
I have n't witnessed any violence , but I have seen people looting houses and shops in their struggle to find food .
I would like to say to people around world : please bring help , bring hands , send food and water
Here 's an example to illustrate the situation - my uncle has a water distribution business .
<TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Right now</TIMEX3> he is distributing the water for free , but he ca n't do that on his own , he has a military escort .
Everybody is looking for food and water .
Aid is coming through , but you do n't see it everywhere , it 's not on a big scale .
People are asking for help and they are wondering why so little has arrived .
<TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-01-15">Yesterday</TIMEX3> I witnessed something that shows how desperate people are .
A rescue team asked a crowd of people to guide them towards places where people might be trapped .
The crowd insisted that they are the ones who needed the help .
I spend my days out in the streets , taking photographs of the destruction and people 's struggle to survive .
Everybody is like me - out in the streets , not by choice , but because there 's no place to go .
People are camping outside , setting up tents on every little green they can find .
I would like to say to people around world : please bring help , send food and water .
The whole city is destroyed and has to be rebuilt .
It 's really difficult to describe .
We need to know what to do after that and <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3> we do n't even know what <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-01-17">tomorrow</TIMEX3> will be like .
Dixie Bickell , director ` ` God 's Littlest Angels '' orphanage , Haiti Hospitals in Haiti are ill - equipped to deal with the injured We look after 147 children , ranging from newborns to 12 - year - olds .
We are running low on supplies : I have enough rice to feed the children for <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P1W">a week</TIMEX3> but we are low on water , sugar , basic foods , diesel and cooking fuel .
I know there will be many more children coming to the orphanage soon , so we need as many beds as we can get .
My house is full at the moment but I would like to take on more orphans .
Even though many have lost their parents , we are praying that their families will come forward for them .
The atmosphere here is still very tense .
We had a large aftershock at <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="1100">1100</TIMEX3> which lasted <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="PT5M">five minutes</TIMEX3> and we have had several smaller ones since then .
It 's incredibly unnerving .
Many of the children are outside , too scared to come in .
We have seen aid at the airport but it will take some time to get to us We have seen some aid at the airport
but I have not seen it being distributed to the people yet .
In any case it will take some time to get to us .
As we are 12 miles from the center of Port - au - Prince I do n't think we will get much help .
<TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-01-16">Today</TIMEX3> I have sent two children to their new families in Luxembourg and three children to families in the Netherlands .
I ' m also hoping we can evacuate more children on <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2010-01-12">Tuesday</TIMEX3> but that is yet to be confirmed .
I really have to applaud the Dutch government for putting the needs of the children first and speeding up the adoption process .
These children were going through the process before the earthquake happened and they have already been approved for adoption by the Haitian authorities .
