UN humanitarian chief John Holmes said the funds were intended to help three million people for <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P6M">six months</TIMEX3> .
The earthquake has left tens of thousands of people dead , and rescuers are continuing an increasingly desperate search for survivors .

The BBC 's Matthew Price , outside the ruins of a nursing college in the capital Port - au - Prince , says he has been told by a female member of staff that there could be 260 dead bodies and up to 25 people still alive under the rubble .
Behind me is what remains of a five - storey building , a college of nursing that is <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> the size of a one - storey building .
According to one of the members of management here , inside there were believed to have been more than 200 people who were crushed when that building came down .
It is also believed that there are possibly 25 people alive in there .
The reason for believing that is that <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="TIME" value="2010-01-15TNI">last night</TIMEX3> a text message was received from someone who said they were inside , that they were very hungry , that they were very hot indeed and that they needed someone to come and rescue them .

Haitian Interior Minister Paul Antoine Bien - Aime told Reuters news agency that 50,000 bodies had already been collected .

Aid workers have been grappling with logistical problems as they attempt to distribute aid .
The port is too damaged to use and roads are blocked by debris , although the main route from the Dominican Republic is <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> clear .
This is a huge and a horrifying catastrophe , the full consequences of which we do not know Correspondents say survivors seem increasingly desperate and angry as bottlenecks and infrastructure damage delay relief efforts .
Mr Holmes , who heads the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs -LRB- Ocha -RRB- , said a massive effort was being mounted and officials were ` ` straining every nerve '' to help .
` ` This is a huge and a horrifying catastrophe , the full consequences of which we do not know , '' he said .
He said almost half of the appeal money would be for emergency food aid , with amounts of between $ 20 m and $ 50 m for health , water and sanitation , nutrition , emergency shelter , early recovery and agriculture .
Mr Holmes earlier told reporters that 30 % of buildings throughout Port - au - Prince had been damaged , with the figure at 50 % in some areas .
Many there have spent a third day without food and shelter in the ruined capital , though UN Secretary General Ban Ki - moon , who is due to visit Haiti on <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2010-01-10">Sunday</TIMEX3> , said distribution of food and medicine was under way .
The BBC 's Nick Davis in Port - au - Prince says the only convoys he has seen are people leaving the city , in search of food , water and medicine .
Correspondents say there is little official presence in Port - au - Prince despite incidents of looting .

Earlier US President Barack Obama described the scale of the devastation as extraordinary and the losses suffered as ` ` heartbreaking '' .
In a statement at the White House , he said the US would ` ` do what it takes to save lives and help people get back on their feet '' .
The US has already sent an aircraft carrier , the USS Carl Vinson , to Haiti and the USS Bataan , carrying a marine expeditionary unit , is on its way .
A hospital ship and more helicopters are due to be sent in the <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">coming days</TIMEX3> , carrying more troops and marines , with the total number of US troops to rise to between 9,000 and 10,000 .
