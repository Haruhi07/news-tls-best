More quakes will happen and more planning is needed , scientists say The lack of earthquake planning by the international community is a ` ` disgrace '' , a leading seismologist has said .
Professor John McCloskey said that governments must prepare for quakes , rather than act after the event .
The University of Ulster expert led the analysis of the quake that started the Indian Ocean <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2004">2004</TIMEX3> tsunami .
` ` It is an international disgrace that we appear not to have made the smallest progress in preparation , '' he said .
` ` The ` international community ' is very good at preparing for war but has failed completely to prepare to help the poor , who are always the ones to suffer in these events .
` ` If we want to claim to be civilised we need to ensure that we never see these scenes again . ''
In a letter to the journal Nature Geoscience he and his team warn that a huge wave - generating quake capable of killing as many people as in the <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2004">2004</TIMEX3> Indian Ocean tsunami could strike off the Indonesian island of Sumatra , with the city of Padang in the path of destruction .
The danger comes from a relentless increase in pressure <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P200Y" mod="MORE_THAN">over the last 200 years</TIMEX3> on a section of the Sunda Trench , one of the world 's most notorious earthquake zones , which runs parallel to the western Sumatra coast .
This section , named after the Mentawai islands , ` ` is near failure , '' the letter warned .
Professor McCloskey said that governments were ` ` refusing the accept the inevitable '' .
` ` Earthquakes happen , they kill people , they will kill more and more people if we do n't organise ourselves properly , '' he said .
He said the earthquake which rocked Padang , western Sumatra in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2009-09">September last year</TIMEX3> killing more than 1,000 people was not the ` ` great earthquake '' scientists were waiting for but it may have made the next massive earthquake more likely .
Professor McCloskey is the head of the Geophysics Research Group at the UoU 's Environmental Sciences Research Institute .
He said that while earthquake prediction was ` ` as far off as ever '' all the indicators are pointed to western Sumatra as a massive quake location .
` ` Scientists can not forecast the exact size of the earthquake but in this case there is complete agreement that it will be very strong , probably bigger than magnitude 8.5 , dwarfing the energy release in the Haitian quake , '' he said .
` ` We also can not say for sure what size the tsunami will be but it has the potential to be very destructive - maybe even worse than <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2004">2004</TIMEX3> .
` ` But the future need not look like Haiti .
We know this earthquake is coming and we might have years or even decades to prepare .
` ` Given the unfolding scenes of carnage following the Haiti earthquake and the completely inadequate speed of the international response , the responsibility on the Indonesian government , the international community and the international NGOs is enormous .
` ` We must work urgently to prepare for this earthquake if we are not to witness again the awful scenes of children dying for want of a few stitches or a cast for a broken leg . ''
