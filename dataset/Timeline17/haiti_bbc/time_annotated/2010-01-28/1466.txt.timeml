Many of Haiti 's streets were devastated after the earthquake Wilmer Blanc sits in the rubble of what remains of his house , refusing to move .
The former bus conductor saved all his life to build this .
<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> it is a wreck , with what few items of furniture he has been able to salvage stacked neatly in a corner .
` ` The way things are <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> , '' he says .
` ` It 's like we are waiting to die - I ' ve got nothing left . ''
His next - door neighbor Jerry , a pensioner , feels the same .
He gestures towards a pile of rubble 50 m -LRB- 164 ft -RRB- away .
Deep beneath the debris are almost certainly buried his neighbor and her two young children .
More than 1.5 million people have been left homeless by the quake Nearly every Haitian you meet has a similar story to tell .
These men are among more than one and half million Haitians left homeless following the earthquake .
In Leogane , the epicentre of the quake , 50 km -LRB- 30 miles -RRB- south - west of the capital , Port - au - Prince , streets have been reduced to dust , and many people , like Wilmer , are not expecting help from the government .
It is a government that barely exists <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> , and which before the earthquake , was mistrusted by many because of high levels of corruption .
I ' m not going to wait for the government to help me
But across the road from these men , modest rebuilding efforts are already under way .
Pierre Paul Guerrier used to run the local brewery .
Although the place has been flattened , along with two of his other houses , he has sold what furniture he has been able to salvage and has begun to rebuild the place .
` ` I ' m not going to wait for the government to help me .
As you can see I ' m rebuilding the foundations here , to stop any rainwater from coming in . ''
In the <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">coming months</TIMEX3> Haiti 's seasonal rains will begin .
So the drive towards reconstruction is a race against time .

The Haitian government needs billions of dollars in assistance to begin the mammoth task of rehabilitating the country .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010-03">March</TIMEX3> a major conference is scheduled to persuade the international community to contribute .
Many are hoping this could be the chance to give the poorest country in the western hemisphere , a fresh start .
The finance ministry building is among those badly damaged by the quake But few Haitians have any illusions about the challenges that lie ahead .
In Port - au - Prince , almost the entire seat of government has been destroyed .
The government revenue office is a sea of rubble and tax forms , and the ministry of finance is a crumbling wreck .
Miraculously the central bank seems to have survived relatively unscathed , but it is surrounded by twisted metal , cars mashed between concrete slabs and huge chunks of stone .
Bulldozers from Haiti 's ministry of public works have started to shift some of the rubble in the main business centres , but if the pace of <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> progress is anything to go by it is likely to take weeks .
The debris is being taken to a waste site on the edge of town , ready to be reused when the reconstruction work begins .
Do n't be fooled by the fact that this looks like business as usual In the worst hit areas , crisis teams have been scrambled from among Haitian professionals and local government chiefs , determined to take a lead .
Their job is to determine the need for the weeks and months ahead .
` ` Schools will be a priority , '' says Leogane deputy mayor Vincent Saint Juste .
` ` We also want to rebuild the churches and health clinics .
This is a city where 90 % of the buildings were destroyed and the remaining ones are unsafe .
So we have to start from scratch .
It 's a city that has to be totally rebuilt . ''
The Red Cross is beginning to send out assessment teams to determine what food , shelter and medicine Haitians will need .
` ` Do n't be fooled by the fact that this looks like business as usual , '' said one Red Cross Worker , who has traveled the world responding to natural disasters .
People here have been incredibly resilient , but although you see them out trading on the streets , clinging on to some sense of normality , Haiti remains a country deeply shaken by the events of <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P2W">the past two weeks</TIMEX3> .
