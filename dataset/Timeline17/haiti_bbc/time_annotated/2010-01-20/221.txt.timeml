SOS Children 's Villages runs a community for <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="1000">1000</TIMEX3> orphaned Haitians A Cambridge - based charity is helping to re - home children orphaned by the earthquake in Haiti .
SOS Children 's Villages runs a home near the capital , which is <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> being used as an emergency hospital .
The organization is working to reunite children with surviving family members .
Describing themselves as ` ` orphan specialists '' , Andrew Cates , from the charity 's UK headquarters , said : ` ` We are , as it were , literally holding the babies . ''
Do you remember what you were doing at <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="TIME" value="XXXX-XX-XXT21:53">2153 GMT</TIMEX3> on the night of <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-01-19">Tuesday</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010-01-12">12 January , 2010</TIMEX3> ?
Perhaps you were getting ready for bed ?
You probably brushed your teeth and checked that your clothes were ready for work the <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="TIME" value="2010-01-21TMO">next morning</TIMEX3> .
In fact , you probably did much the same as you would on any other evening .
Seven thousand kilometres away on an island in the Caribbean it was still daylight .
Not yet <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="TIME" value="2010-01-21T17:00">5 pm</TIMEX3> local time , you would still have been at work .
Or preparing supper for your family .
And this was the moment that the earthquake struck .
With a magnitude of 7.0 , the quake is estimated to have killed over 200,000 people , with a further three million affected .
Numerous aid agencies , charities and international troops have descended on the island to assist in the humanitarian relief effort .
Among these is a Cambridge - based charity - SOS Children 's Villages -LRB-
SOS CV -RRB- - an international organization supporting over 70,000 orphaned children in 124 countries .
Andrew Cates , chief executive of SOS CV in Cambridge , explained why staff from the charity - which already has a base in Haiti - are well - placed to help the children affected by the earthquake .
` ` Our children 's village -LRB- in Santo , 16 km from Port - au - Prince -RRB- is largely intact , '' he said .
` ` We have food , water and electricity , and the village playing field is <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> having an emergency hospital built on it because we are one of the very few places with a working infrastructure there .
` ` But our national office in Haiti has been destroyed , '' he continued .
` ` We had a social center in town which is completely gone and a vocational training center that no one 's even been able to get to because it 's in an area that 's been totally devastated .
` ` So , the village itself is totally serviceable and is <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> being used as a hub , to help in particular the children and the orphaned children around Port - au - Prince . ''
` ` The role that we 're given is to look after the unaccompanied children , the lone children .
We trace the families , we do trauma therapy and at the end of <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DURATION" value="P18M">18 months</TIMEX3> of trying to find a family - and the best solution for every child - we typically end up with 500 or 600 children who live in family - based care in our children 's villages .
Earthquake devastation near SOS Children 's Villages '
Santo home in Haiti ` ` We are orphan specialists .
In Haiti we have trauma specialists who know how to deal with children who are traumatised .
` ` We have people with a lot of experience in tracing families and we have local staff - and that helps with understanding the local culture and with clues about local families or where they might come from . ''
If a child ends up staying at one of SOS 's villages , they are cared for ` ` through to independence '' .
Andrew is quick to point out that the definition of independence depends very much on local culture as well as the individual child .
` ` Quite a lot of the children who are more difficult to place have some degree of developmental problems and so some of them end up being supported by us , to a degree , for life .
` ` We take children on - and when we do , we take them on as a parent would - with a commitment that as long as they need us , we will be there for them . ''
<TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="P2D">Two days</TIMEX3> after the earthquake , SOS staff from the neighbouring Dominican Republic hired a helicopter and flew to Haiti .
They were unable to land but filmed the devastation .
