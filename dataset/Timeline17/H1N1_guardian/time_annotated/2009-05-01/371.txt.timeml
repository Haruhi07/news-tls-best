<TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2009-04-23">Eight days ago</TIMEX3> , Graeme Pacitti and friends from his amateur football team gathered to welcome the newly married man back from his honeymoon in Mexico .
As Pacitti and the others sat around Iain Askham , they noticed he seemed tired .
That was put down to jetlag but <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="UNDEF-REF-hour-PLUS-48">48 hours later</TIMEX3> , Askham and his wife , Dawn , were swept into an isolation ward at Monklands hospital , 20 miles away in Airdrie , the first two British cases of swine flu .
<TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2009-05-01">Today</TIMEX3> , Pacitti , the goalkeeper for their six - a - side team FC Mallard and a clerical worker at Falkirk Royal Infirmary , was confirmed as the first person to catch swine flu within the UK .
The result left him feeling ` ` really disappointed '' , he said .
` ` <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2009-05-01">Today</TIMEX3> I started to feel better than I have done all week .
I ' m quite gutted . ''
Confined at home with his mother Lesley , her boyfriend , and his younger brother Alan , he has been taking the anti - viral drug Tamiflu and nursing an aching head and throat .
` ` It started <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2009-04-25">last Saturday</TIMEX3> when I started to feel like I had an upset stomach .
From then my throat began to get sore , '' he said .
` ` The worst was when I started to get headaches and feel quite feverish . ''
Yet <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2009-W18" mod="START">earlier this week</TIMEX3> , Pacitti assumed he had avoided catching the virus .
He had initially been cleared after he and two other members of that group out drinking with Askham and his best man , Neil Gardner , 26 , developed mild cold - like symptoms .
But <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2009-W18" mod="START">earlier this week</TIMEX3> , after Pacitti started to feel unwell , further tests confirmed he was carrying the influenza A - type virus the group which includes swine flu , known to the experts at H1N1 .

But that kind of flu virus is rare in <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2009-SP" mod="END">late spring</TIMEX3> .
That immediately made it likely that Pacitti was the first case of onward transmission in Britain .
It has already happened in the US , Canada , Spain and Germany .
