PA An outbreak of swine flu at a Birmingham primary school led to 44 new cases of the virus being confirmed <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2009-05-25">yesterday</TIMEX3> , the largest number in a single day since the spread began .
Pupils at Welford primary in Handsworth , Birmingham , began feeling ill <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2009-W21">last week</TIMEX3> when three cases were initially diagnosed .
<TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2009-05-25">Yesterday</TIMEX3> , lab results confirmed a further 44 infections at the school .
They included 41 children and three adults .
Three more people from the east of England and London were also diagnosed , taking the total in the UK so far to 184 , the Department of Health said .
The Health Protection Agency -LRB- HPA -RRB- insisted that high rates of infection were to be expected in school environments where children come into close contact with one another .
The school is closed <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2009-W22">this week</TIMEX3> for half term and expected to open for all pupils who are feeling well <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2009-W23">next week</TIMEX3> .
Before the holidays began , the headteacher informed the HPA there had been an unusually high number of absences owing to illness .
At least 100 children had been off sick , according to local reports .
As a result of the first confirmed case , all parents and staff were told either to attend the school over <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2009-W21-WE">the weekend</TIMEX3> to collect antiviral medication or to receive medical attention at home .
A joint statement issued by the school and the HPA , posted on the school 's website , says that it is undergoing a ` ` deep clean '' of the premises during the holiday before it reopens .
The headteacher , Chris Smith , was unavailable for comment <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2009-05-25">yesterday</TIMEX3> .
The HPA said that all confirmed cases are being treated at home with antivirals and are responding well to treatment .
HPA officers contacted every parent of children in the school as well as teachers to find out if they have symptoms .
A spokeswoman for the HPA said that they had not yet identified the source of the outbreak .
` ` The initial case is still under investigation .
The vast majority of cases have been in people <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> returning from an infected country or who have been in close contact with someone who has just returned .
This is one of a very small number of cases where there is n't that history , '' she said .
The school <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> featured in a BBC2 documentary called The Primary , about building a multicultural school community with children of 17 different nationalities .
The school has 420 pupils and 60 in its nursery unit .
Almost 50 countries have <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> confirmed cases of swine flu and about 13,000 people around the world have been diagnosed with the virus .
The death toll from the virus in Mexico stands at 83 , while 12 people have died in the United States and two have died in Canada .
Of four cases confirmed on <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2009-05-25">Monday</TIMEX3> in the UK , one was <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2009-05-25">yesterday</TIMEX3> revealed to be a two - year - old boy from Oxford .
A DoH spokesman said : ` ` The localized cases of swine flu found in the UK have so far been mild , and we have not seen evidence of widespread community transmission .
Our strategy of containing the spread with anti - virals appears to have been effective in reducing symptoms and preventing further spread of infection .
` ` But we must not be complacent it is right to prepare for the possibility of a global pandemic .
The UK 's arrangements are continuing , to ensure that we are well - placed to deal with this new infection . ''
