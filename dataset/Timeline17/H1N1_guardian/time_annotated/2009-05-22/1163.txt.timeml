Mexico City lowers swine flu alert Situation under control , relax , there 's no need to wear masks , says mayor Days of mask - wearing in Mexico City could be over .
Photograph : Reuters\/Eliana Aponte Mexico City lowered its swine flu alert level from yellow to green late <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="TIME" value="2009-05-21TNI">last night</TIMEX3> as the mayor , Marcelo Ebrard , claimed residents could ` ` relax '' as there had been no new infections for <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P1W">a week</TIMEX3> .
Ebrard said the change meant the risk of contagion was low , the situation was under control and the images of countless people wearing blue surgical masks around the city could be consigned to history .
There 's no longer any need to wear masks , Ebrard said , adding : ` ` <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> you can come to the city without any risk . ''
With fears of an immediate global pandemic fading , Japan , where there have been almost 300 swine flu cases , also relaxed rules amid fears that the strict regulations could harm the economy and put needless restrictions on the public .
` ` It is important to make it possible for the local government to respond flexibly , depending on the situation of the region , '' the prime minister , Taro Aso , said .
Under the new guidelines , suspected patients in areas where the number of cases are rapidly increasing would be allowed to go to regular medical clinics rather than only designated ` ` fever centres '' set up to deal with swine flu , the health minister , Yoichi Masuzoe , said .
The World Health Organisation <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2009-05-22">today</TIMEX3> said that 42 countries had recorded 11,168 cases of swine flu , including 86 deaths , since the outbreak was first noticed in Mexico <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2009-04">last month</TIMEX3> .
In Italy , two secondary schools in Rome have been ordered to close for <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P1W">a week</TIMEX3> after four students caught the H1N1 flu virus on a trip to New York .
In Mexico , where 75 swine flu deaths have occurred , the health authorities said no one had been taken to hospital with respiratory infections in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P3D">the past three days</TIMEX3> .
There have been no confirmed swine flu cases since <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2009-05-14">May 14</TIMEX3> .
` ` We are seeing a 96 % drop in cases and that 's why we are dropping the alert level to green <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2009-05-22">today</TIMEX3> , '' the Mexico City health secretary , Armando Ahued , said .
Since the outbreak was declared on <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2009-04-23">23 April</TIMEX3> , Mexico City has spent 4.5 bn pesos -LRB- # 217 m -RRB- on medicine and antibacterial gel and to provide incentives for businesses to shut their doors and to clean public spaces .
A total of 4,008 people have been infected in Mexico .
The country 's confirmed toll has been rising as scientists test a backlog of samples from patients .
Ebrard urged Mexicans to remain vigilant , to maintain sanitary conditions in places where crowds gather such as the metro system and schools , and to support a ` ` culture of health '' .
` ` The big lesson is that we understand what the scientists have been saying for <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="P1DE">a decade</TIMEX3> : that we have to be prepared for any possible virus that can appear , '' the mayor said .
Nearly 80 % of those who died were between 20 and 54 , according to the health department .
However , many suffered from underlying medical conditions .
Almost 30 % were obese or had other metabolical problems , and 13 % had cardiovascular problems .
New test results from the US Centres of Disease Control show that people in their 60s and older have signs of greater immunity to the new swine flu virus .
Scientists think that is because older people have been exposed to other viruses that are more similar to swine flu than more <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> seasonal flu .
