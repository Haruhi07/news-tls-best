What is swine flu ?
Swine influenza is a highly contagious disease that causes respiratory illness in pigs .
Most outbreaks happen on farms in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2009-FA" mod="END">late autumn</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2009-WI">winter</TIMEX3> , when the virus kills around 1 % to 4 % of the animals it infects .
The disease is caused by a type A influenza virus , and the new strain belongs to the most common subtype , known as H1N1 .
Experts are particularly anxious about flu viruses that spread from pigs to humans , because the animals can harbor several flu viruses at once , which can swap genes around and become more virulent .
Influenza viruses are made up of only eight genes .
The new strain has six genes from a swine flu virus known to be circulating in North America , but this virus is itself a mixture of human , pig and avian flu viruses .
The other two genes come from a swine virus found in European and Asian pigs .
How do humans catch it ?
Swine flu spreads to people in two ways .
They contract the virus after being in contact with infected pigs or areas where the pigs have been , or they catch it from an infected person .
The disease spreads in the same way as human flu , through coughs and sneezes , or by touching a contaminated surface and then touching the nose or mouth .
The latest outbreak appears to have started in Mexico City .
Swine flu viruses rarely infect humans , but there have been sporadic cases in the past .
In most cases , the infection makes people unwell but is not life - threatening .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="1976">1976</TIMEX3> , a swine flu outbreak in New Jersey made more than 200 people seriously ill and killed one .
The virus is thought to have circulated for <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P1M">a month</TIMEX3> before disappearing .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="1988">1988</TIMEX3> , a pregnant 32 - year - old woman in Wisconsin died in hospital after becoming infected .
Between <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2005">2005</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2009-01">January 2009</TIMEX3> , there were 12 human cases of swine flu in America , but none were fatal .
The infection can not be spread by eating pork or pork products .
The symptoms of swine flu are similar to normal flu , and include fever , cough , sore throat , body aches , chills and fatigue .
Some patients have also reported diarrhoea and vomiting .
In very young children , the warning signs include fast or troubled breathing , a bluish skin tone , a failure to interact with others , and being highly irritable .
As with seasonal flu , swine flu varies in severity , with the worst cases leading to fatal pneumonia and respiratory failure .
The new strain seems to be more lethal to those in the 25 to 45 age range - an ominous sign , as this was a hallmark of the Spanish <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="1918">1918</TIMEX3> flu pandemic that killed tens of millions worldwide .
Younger people were probably hit harder by the <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="1918">1918</TIMEX3> flu virus because their immune systems over - reacted .
Why is it spreading so fast ?
This is a key question the World Health Organisation needs to answer .
So far , the virus is not well enough understood to know why it is so transmissible and virulent .
<TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="PXD" mod="MORE_THAN">Over the next few days</TIMEX3> , epidemiologists will use information from the outbreak to work out if a global pandemic is likely .
Further tests are needed to confirm whether the fatalities in Mexico were caused by the same virus that is causing more mild illness in America and other countries .
What steps are being taken to contain the outbreak ?
Most experts think it is impossible to contain the virus <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> it has spread from Mexico to the US and New Zealand and probably other countries .
In Mexico , officials have banned the traditional greetings of handshakes and kisses on the cheek , barred spectators from football matches , closed museums and advised churchgoers to stay at home in an attempt to halt the spread of the disease .
Other countries have begun screening air travellers for the disease and have set up quarantines for people who might be infected .
In Britain , health officials have stepped up surveillance for the infection .
The chief medical officer , Liam Donaldson , issued an alert to hospitals outlining the symptoms to look for , and what tests should be done if doctors suspect they have an infected patient .
If the virus arrives in Britain , doctors will use the government 's # 500 m stockpile of tamiflu anti - viral drugs to treat patients and protect frontline hospital staff .
Is there a vaccine for swine flu ?

The seasonal flu jab given to the elderly over <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2009-WI">the winter</TIMEX3> months works well against human flu viruses , but swine flu is so different , the vaccine is unlikely to be effective .
Any decision to produce fresh vaccine for the swine flu virus will be made by the World Health Organisation .
Making enough for Britain alone could take <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DURATION" value="P4M">four</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="P6M">six months</TIMEX3> , an expert at the Health Protection Agency said .
South Park nails it .
