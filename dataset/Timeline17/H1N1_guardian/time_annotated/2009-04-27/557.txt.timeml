Professionals may be better prepared to deal with a pandemic .
But it does n't mean we are safe For the first time since <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="1976">1976</TIMEX3> , a strain of influenza virus - apparently related to the <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="1918">1918</TIMEX3> - <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="1919">19</TIMEX3> pandemic - has infected the public .
More than 1,000 cases have been reported in Mexico , with over 80 deaths .

And the disease has <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> spread to several areas within the United States and to New Zealand .
The virus has been identified by the American Centres for Disease Control and Prevention -LRB- CDC -RRB- as type H1N1 , containing a mixture of swine , avian and human genetic material .
This outbreak of influenza is viewed with alarm by public health workers .
First , because the earlier pandemic was so deadly ; second , because this is the first clear demonstration of human - to - human spread of the infection ; and third , because it apparently started its spread after the normal '' flu season '' in the northern hemisphere .
However , the world may be much better prepared to cope with this outbreak than before .
One reason is that an earlier swine flu outbreak in the US , in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="1976">1976</TIMEX3> , found both the political and medical\/public health worlds unprepared to cope with what appeared to be a serious threat of pandemic spread .
Fortunately , the outbreak never came , but many of the lessons of that era were well learned - especially by the public health community .
Thus , when avian flu seemed to threaten the world in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent years</TIMEX3> , both national public health bureaus around the world and the World Health Organisation organised themselves for action and began to stockpile anti - flu drugs and to ramp up the facilities for vaccine formation .
These efforts have facilitated the early response measures for the <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> swine flu threat .
Both the CDC and the WHO have mobilised to assist the Mexicans , and health offices across the world are becoming active .
It is clear from the above that public health workers are better prepared to deal with this threat .
Science is also better prepared than it was earlier - the genome of the virus was quickly analyzed and seed stocks for vaccine production isolated -LRB- although it will take <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="PXM">many months</TIMEX3> to prepare enough doses to immunise large populations against the prevalent strain of virus -RRB- .
Medicine is also better prepared , since it can distribute the already stockpiled antiviral drugs , and has far better treatments for the pneumonias and other secondary problems that threaten life .
This is not to say that a pandemic , if it does indeed come , will not be serious .
The illness of large numbers of people , even when the infection itself is not directly life - threatening , is often accompanied by severe social disruptions .
Schools close , normal pursuits suffer , and emergency rooms and the entire healthcare system become seriously overloaded .
History demonstrates that the greatest threat from even a mild disease that affects large numbers of individuals simultaneously may come from the accompanying social disruption and lack of nursing care available to the sick .
Thus , while the professionals may be better prepared to deal with a threatened pandemic , it is not yet clear that the politicians around the world have learned the same lessons .
Governments might have to nationalise their healthcare systems in order to cope , just as they have had to do <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> with their financial systems - something that might be far more difficult in the US than in Britain and elsewhere .
