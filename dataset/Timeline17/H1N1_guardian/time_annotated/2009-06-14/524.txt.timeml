Swine flu is officially a pandemic .

But do n't worry ...
not yet , anyway Out of 30,000 global cases , only 145 deaths have been reported and development of a vaccine is well under way .
But scientists will not relax : the virus could mutate and grow stronger over <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2009-SU">the summer</TIMEX3> - and what happens if it mixes with bird flu ?
It was the final surge in numbers that forced the World Health Organisation to act .
With confirmation <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2009-W23">last week</TIMEX3> that swine flu cases had risen above 1,000 in Australia , it was clear the disease was <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> spreading freely around the world .
Thousands of cases had already been reported in the United States , Mexico and Chile .
Officials at the World Health Organisation simply had no choice .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2009-06-11">Thursday</TIMEX3> , they announced swine flu had achieved pandemic status , the first strain of influenza to reach this mark for <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P41Y">41 years</TIMEX3> .
It seems an alarming prospect .
Are we again set to face a disease that can kill millions as happened with the pandemics of <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="1918">1918</TIMEX3> , <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="1957">1957</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="1968">1968</TIMEX3> ?
Margaret Chan , the World Health Organisation 's director general , was confident , however .
The disease is only a ` ` moderately severe '' risk , she announced .
Out of 30,000 cases worldwide , only 145 deaths have been reported .
Development of a vaccine - the world 's main anti - flu weapon - is already under way while stockpiles of anti - viral drugs such as Tamiflu are also available , at least for developed nations .
It would be premature to assume complete security , however .
Before the world vanquishes swine flu , many hurdles will have to be cleared .
In particular , every stage of the development of a swine flu vaccine , our key hope of fighting the disease , could be disrupted , scientists warned <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2009-W23">last week</TIMEX3> .
` ` We must be prepared for something that is more severe than is <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> observed , '' said Dr Alan Hay , director of the World Influenza Centre , in London .
` ` We can not be complacent . ''
For a start , swine flu vaccine production is still at a very early stage .
Indeed , the artificial strain that will form the core of a vaccine has only just been created , with researchers in Britain , Australia and the US having produced almost identical versions .
These have only just been passed to pharmaceutical firms to see if they can quickly produce the vaccine on a mass scale .

The British version of the vaccine strain - known as RG121 - was created <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2009-W22">two weeks ago</TIMEX3> at the National Institute for Biological Standards Control near London .
Like its US and Australian counterparts , it is made of bits of several flu viruses but specifically stimulates immunity against swine flu .
Unlike swine flu , however , it can be grown easily in hens ' eggs .
Eggs are used throughout the drugs industry as incubators in which viruses - the basic components of vaccines - are grown .
` ` Hens ' eggs remain the bulwark for vaccine production , '' said Professor Peter Dunnill , of the Centre for Biochemical Engineering at University College London .
` ` It is a pretty ponderous business , however .
Each egg has to be looked after carefully and you have to beware lest infections kill them off . ''
This point was backed by Dr James Robertson , leader of the team that created the RG121 strain .
` ` Different strains behave differently in eggs and produce varying amounts of virus particles .
In the case of our swine flu vaccine strain , we simply do not know yet how much virus you will get from each egg ,
At present , pharmaceutical companies ' estimates of the amounts of virus particles they will get from their eggs are optimistic .
This could be a mistake , warn scientists , and companies could find they get less than a third or a quarter as many viral particles as they hoped for , a reduction that would , in turn , limit the number of vaccine doses available to the public .
Once viruses are extracted from eggs they are broken into pieces including bits of their protein coats .
These protein pieces are important because they stimulate immune responses in humans and can be used to make a vaccine .
` ` Coat proteins raise antibodies in the blood so that a person , coming across the real live virus , will be prepared to launch an immune attack against it , '' said Robertson .
But sometimes , it takes more than one dose of a vaccine to stimulate full protection .
The <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> seasonal flu vaccine requires only a single shot but other vaccines require two inoculations , a point stressed by Dr Hay .
` ` It may require two doses to provide significant immunity against swine flu , '' he told the Observer .
And if a swine flu vaccine requires a double dose , this would also limit numbers of doses available to provide full protection as quickly as possible .
Even if viral production in eggs goes to plan , manufacturers such as GlaxoSmithKline will be stretched to meet demands and have decided to add chemicals known as adjuvants to their vaccines .
Adjuvants stimulate immune systems and so reduce amounts of vaccine needed to create antibody protection in an individual .
` ` We will be using adjuvants in our vaccines , '' said Stephen Rae of GlaxoSmithKline .
` ` This will be the first time we have used them for a flu vaccine but we are confident they will work . ''
However , Professor Dunnill again warned that care should be taken with such predictions .
` ` It remains to be seen if pharmaceuticals can rely on using adjuvants and still produce a single dose vaccine against swine flu , '' he said .
And then there is the issue of timing .
At present , only a limited number of people have succumbed to swine flu in the UK with the Health Protection Agency putting the figure at 1,121 confirmed cases <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2009-06-13">yesterday</TIMEX3> .
But most scientists <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> predict a second wave of the disease is likely to strike later in the year .
Exactly when and how it hits will have profound consequences for Britain , as Hay explained .
` ` The key issue is how the virus mutates in the southern hemisphere <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DURATION" value="PXM" mod="MORE_THAN">over the next few months</TIMEX3> during <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2009-WI">the winter</TIMEX3> there .
That is far more important than its behavior in the northern hemisphere during our <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2009-SP">spring</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2009-SU">summer</TIMEX3> . ''
The virus is more likely to spread through populations during the southern hemisphere in <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2009-WI">winter</TIMEX3> and the more it does so , the more it is likely to mutate , possibly into a new , more virulent form .
There is also the issue of the timing of that return .
If a reinvigorated , more virulent forms appears late in the year , health and pharmaceutical workers could have enough time to prepare reasonable supplies of vaccine .
` ` However , if it returns earlier in the year , in <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2009-09">September</TIMEX3> , say , there is not much chance we will have enough vaccine ready by then , '' Dr Hay warned .
` ` It is undoubtedly a problem .
Certainly , there is no doubt the big issue here is time . ''
Should vaccine supplies be low when the second wave strikes , health workers will then face a problem of deciding which members of the public should be rated as priority targets .
Health and utility workers , police and security staff , will be obvious choices .
But selecting the elderly - a key choice for seasonal flu vaccine - as priorities for swine flu vaccines would be a mistake , Hay said .
` ` Around 75 per cent of people who have succumbed to swine flu have been under age of 30 and very few have been over 60 .
It is very likely that people of 60 and above may well have some immunity . ''
Intriguingly swine flu is of the same basic type , called H1N1 , as the virus that caused the <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="1918">1918</TIMEX3> pandemic , the world 's worst outbreak of flu which killed up to 100 million people across the globe .
` ` That basic strain circulated round the world for another <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DURATION" value="P4DE">four decades</TIMEX3> until <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="1957">1957</TIMEX3> when it was replaced by a new type , known as H2N2 , which was responsible for the Asian flu epidemic of that year , '' Hay said .
In other words , people who were children or young adults before <TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="DATE" value="1957">1957</TIMEX3> may well be carrying immune protection to an old virus that is a distant descendant of the <TIMEX3 tid="t36" type="DATE" value="1918">1918</TIMEX3> flu strain and which is giving them protection against swine flu .
Hence the relatively robust response of those over 60 to the <TIMEX3 tid="t40" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> pandemic - though these individuals will still need protection from standard seasonal flu with vaccines that are <TIMEX3 tid="t41" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> being stockpiled by pharmaceutical firms .
Vaccines are not our only protection against flu , of course .
Anti - viral drugs - in particular , Tamiflu - block the spread of the flu virus between cells in the body and offer another line of defense against the disease .
` ` Vaccines are our real hope but there is no doubt Tamiflu will help , '' said Dunnill .
` ` But we should note resistance to the drug is spreading .
The normal seasonal flu virus has acquired Tamiflu resistance over <TIMEX3 tid="t42" type="DATE" value="2008">the past year</TIMEX3> and we will have to monitor , very carefully , how swine flu behaves .
We can not take the drug for granted , that is certain . ''
And finally scientists point to the disturbing scenario in which swine flu spreads to countries such as Indonesia and infects animals or humans who are already affected by bird flu .
The latter disease is difficult to acquire but is highly virulent if caught .
By contrast , swine flu is easy to pass on although , at present , it rarely produces serious symptoms .
In a person who becomes infected by both strains , however , it is possible that there will be an exchange of genetic material resulting in the creation of an easily transmissible but highly virulent virus .
` ` It is a nightmare vision which , fortunately , remains only a remote prospect at present , '' said Dunnill .
All these issues make it difficult for doctors and scientists to be certain how they will cope if swine flu , as expected , returns to Britain with renewed vigor <TIMEX3 tid="t44" type="DATE" value="2009" mod="END">later this year</TIMEX3> .
Or it may return in a relatively non - virulent form and pharmaceutical companies may suffer no vaccine production problems .
Alternatively , things could go wrong .
` ` We can anticipate many things and that , in the end , is all we can do , '' said Hay .
` ` We must prepare as best we can for all these scenarios and then deal with the ones that unfold .
It will probably be a long battle , however . ''
But do n't worry ...
not yet ,
