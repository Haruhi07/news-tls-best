Swine flu and the lessons of <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="1918">1918</TIMEX3> The response to the Spanish flu pandemic of <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="1918">1918</TIMEX3> offers clues to how we should deal with swine flu
And lo it came to pass .
<TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2005">Four years ago</TIMEX3> , Sir Liam Donaldson predicted that a new pandemic was ` ` inevitable '' .
` ` It 's happened before , in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="1918">1918</TIMEX3> , <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="1958">1958</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="1969">1969</TIMEX3> , '' the chief medical officer informed Andrew Marr on the BBC 's <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2009-04-26">Sunday</TIMEX3> AM program .
` ` These things come in natural cycles , once every <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P10Y">10</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P40Y">40 years</TIMEX3> . ''
It will be little comfort to Donaldson that he is on the brink of being proven right and right on cue .

The Mexican strain of swine flu <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> sweeping the world is a pandemic in all but name we are only awaiting the formal declaration from the WHO .
As someone who has spent <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="P5Y">the last five years</TIMEX3> studying mutating strains of influenza first in the field as a correspondent for the Observer and the Guardian , latterly as a historian based at the Wellcome Trust , I take no pleasure in being proven similarly prescient .
If history teaches us anything it is that the past is not necessarily a guide to the future .
But based on the events of <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="PXD">the last few days</TIMEX3> , the parallels with <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="1918">1918</TIMEX3> the last great pandemic may be unavoidable .
Mexican swine flu is a H1N1 hybrid consisting of pig , human and avian genes .
The <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="1918">1918</TIMEX3> pandemic virus was also a H1N1 hybrid containing a mix of avian and non - avian genes .
It <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> appears that an unusual cluster of influenza - like illnesses which have been the index cases of Mexican swine flu erupted in La Gloria in Veracruz in <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2009-04" mod="START">early April</TIMEX3> , a highly unusual time of year for an outbreak of influenza in the northern hemisphere .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="1918">1918</TIMEX3> , the earliest reports of what would prove to be the pandemic strain also came from the Americas , from Haskell County , Kansas , where doughboys at a US army base were being fattened on chickens and pork grown on local farms before crossing the Atlantic to reinforce the allied lines .
And in <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="1918">1918</TIMEX3> as <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> there were also reports of young adults , men and women in their <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="192" mod="START">early 20s</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="193">30s</TIMEX3> , falling prey to unusual pneumonias .
So what should we make of the reports of the growing morbidity and morality from Mexico , and should we be worried ?
In <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent days</TIMEX3> , I have found myself being asked this continually in interviews with CNN , the BBC and Sky .
I do not have a good answer yet .
Three thousand children die of malaria <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EVERY">every day</TIMEX3> in Africa , I want to say .
But that 's no good because malaria is hardly a disease that is likely to bite you in Britain .
But once again HIV , rightly or wrongly , is only perceived as a threat to ` ` high risk '' groups .
The point is that influenza is an aerosol infection , as ubiquitous as air and as hard to avoid as breathing itself .
But we need to and must keep things in perspective .
Some 10,000 people die of influenza <TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="SET" value="P1Y" quant="EVERY">every year</TIMEX3> in Britain during the normal <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DATE" value="2009-WI">winter</TIMEX3> flu season .
So far the Mexican flu has killed a grand total of just 160 people worldwide .
Even if Mexican swine flu does prove to be a so - called Armageddon strain and , as I write , that is still a very big if there is every reason to believe we will cope , as long as we learn from and can avoid the mistakes of <TIMEX3 tid="t36" type="DATE" value="1918">1918</TIMEX3> .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t37" type="DATE" value="1918">1918</TIMEX3> , Britain did not have a national health service , nor was there a ministry of health to coordinate the national response to the Spanish influenza so - called because Spain , not being party to the war , saw no need to censor news of the spreading depredation -LRB- by contrast , British newspapers , perhaps for the sake of national morale , treated the ` ` Spanish Lady '' as something of a joke -RRB- .
Nor in <TIMEX3 tid="t38" type="DATE" value="1918">1918</TIMEX3> did we possess antiviral drugs , antibiotics or a vaccine hardly surprising given that in <TIMEX3 tid="t39" type="DATE" value="1918">1918</TIMEX3> the scientific consensus was that influenza was caused by a bacteria , not a virus .
We did , however , possess a highly militarised economy , one that , should the authorities have so desired , could have been drilled to take the threat more seriously .

But there was a war to win and the government did not wish to panic the populace .
Instead , Britain 's then chief medical officer , Sir Arthur Newsholme , decreed that national circumstances dictated that Britons should ` ` carry on '' a message that the Times and other establishment organs were happy to iterate .
<TIMEX3 tid="t40" type="DATE" value="2009-04-30">Today</TIMEX3> , of course , we live in a very different world .
Thanks to the internet and 24\/7 rolling news channels , information about epidemic diseases travels far faster than a virus can ever hope to , and competition between papers means that hysterical , unscientific claims are ubiquitous .
The result is a sort of media - induced collective dread a sickness of the soul far in excess of the actual threat to our bodies .
So , to the return to the question that Simon Mayo posed to me on Radio 5 Live on <TIMEX3 tid="t41" type="DATE" value="2009-04-28">Tuesday</TIMEX3> : what should we do ?
Well , for starters , we could do worse than to follow Newsholme 's advice in <TIMEX3 tid="t42" type="DATE" value="1918">1918</TIMEX3> to stay calm and to ` ` carry on '' .
Secondly , for all our sophisticated drugs and medical technology , we may find that some of the most effective measures are the simplest .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t46" type="DATE" value="1918">1918</TIMEX3> , when the LGB was finally girded into action late on in the pandemic , Newsholme advised people to avoid sneezing and coughing in public , and to keep plenty of fresh handkerchiefs on hand -LRB-
the handkerchief to be ` ` boiled , or burned if of paper '' -RRB- .
Other simple hygiene measures included washing one 's hands and gargling with a disinfectant mouthwash .
I have yet to see Donaldson or Alan Johnson issue the last item of advice , but in every other respect they have repeated Newsholme 's formulations to the letter .
<TIMEX3 tid="t48" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> , the Department of Health is also taking a leaf from the book of an even more heroic <TIMEX3 tid="t47" type="DATE" value="1918">1918</TIMEX3> figure .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t49" type="DATE" value="2008-06">June</TIMEX3> of that awful year , while the majority of his countrymen were doing their best to ignore the threat from Spain , James Niven , the medical officer of health for Manchester , had 35,000 handbills printed and distributed throughout the city spelling out in clear and easy - to - understand English the dangers of influenza and giving strict instructions for the isolation of the sick .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t50" type="DATE" value="2008-11">November</TIMEX3> , when the second deadly wave of the pandemic swept through Britain , he went a stage further , printing more handbills and posting warnings throughout the city urging people to avoid trams and unventilated assembly halls .
Niven 's proactive measures delayed the onset of influenza in Manchester , buying the city valuable time .
The result was that when the virus returned as Niven knew it would just 1,700 Mancunians lost their lives .
By contrast , in London , where some boroughs closed their schools and others prevaricated , some 10,000 people died .
There is no reason , as yet , to believe that we are on the brink of a similar disaster .
Having said that if the Department of Health 's ` ` Catch it , bin it , kill it '' campaign launched <TIMEX3 tid="t51" type="DATE" value="2009-04-30">today</TIMEX3> can prevent even one unnecessary death , then the further ratcheting up of public anxieties will surely be a price worth paying .
Time for a ban .
