Photograph : PA Two Britons have <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> contracted swine flu within the UK , it was confirmed <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2009-05-01">yesterday</TIMEX3> , as the total number of cases rose to 13 .
Graeme Pacitti , a clerical worker at Falkirk Royal Infirmary , became the first person confirmed with the disease who had not visited Mexico .
He is thought to have become infected after a night out with Iain Askham , a football team - mate who contracted the virus on his honeymoon in Canc n , Mexico .
Late <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="TIME" value="2009-05-01TNI">last night</TIMEX3> the Health Protection Agency confirmed that a 42 - year - old from south Gloucestershire who had not visited Mexico had become infected in England .
Sir Liam Donaldson , the government 's chief medical adviser , said : ` ` The first non - imported cases of swine flu have been confirmed in England and Scotland .
The infection appears to have been acquired by person - to - person spread within the United Kingdom .
` ` Until <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> cases were confined to people who had <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> come back from Mexico .
The person in the south - west is being treated with Tamiflu . ''
A 12 - year - old girl was also among five new cases , prompting the immediate closure of her school in south Gloucestershire .
The girl , a pupil at Downend School , was on the same flight as Askham and his wife , Dawn .
Government scientists who are studying the virus said early analysis showed it was likely to cause only a mild epidemic , probably no worse than anything seen in a normal flu season .
Biologists at the National Institute for Medical Research in London said that antiviral medicines such as Tamiflu would probably control the spread of the disease .
Pacitti , 24 , was the 10th confirmed case of swine flu in the UK , while <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2009-05-01" mod="START">earlier yesterday</TIMEX3> a Merseyside woman who had <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> returned from Mexico was confirmed as the ninth .
Referring to Pacitti , the Scottish health secretary , Nicola Sturgeon , said : ` ` This is significant as it represents the first case in the UK of person - to - person transmission of this virus .
The person had n't been in Mexico or any other affected area .
He had been in contact with someone who had .
` ` I want to stress , however , that it does n't mean that there is more reason to worry .
We 're working hard to try to disrupt this infection and stop it spreading . ''
The Health Protection Agency said : ` ` We are working to ensure that any close contacts of patients who test positive for swine influenza are offered antivirals as a precautionary measure .
At this stage close contacts who should be offered antivirals -LRB- are those -RRB- who have been exposed to a probable or confirmed case within <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P7D">the previous seven days</TIMEX3> for <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="PT1H" mod="MORE_THAN">longer than one hour</TIMEX3> and within a distance of one metre . ''
The agency advised people returning from affected areas in Mexico who become unwell within <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P7D">seven days</TIMEX3> of their return to stay at home and contact their GP by phone or ring NHS Direct .
The agency said it was aware of head teachers and governors considering temporary closure of schools as a precaution when suspected cases of infection were still under investigation but had yet to be confirmed .
But it advised these measures only when a case is strongly suspected or confirmed within a school .
<TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2009-05-01" mod="START">Earlier yesterday</TIMEX3> Gordon Brown offered reassurance that Britain was well - placed to deal with the outbreak .
On a visit to an NHS Direct call center in Beckenham , south - east London , he said the advice line was coping well with demand .
The government was increasing the number of face masks available to the NHS and looking at different vaccines , while stressing that the Tamiflu antiviral drug would deal with the disease .
Brown added : ` ` This is happening in every country of the world , but we are better prepared .
If people have the symptoms they should ask for advice as quickly as possible .
` ` We are finding with NHS Direct that they can both reassure people and give people advice about where to go .
This is a system that 's working , it 's calm , it 's ordered , it 's giving people the right information . ''
Brown said all the cases in the UK were mild .
The Netherlands , France and Switzerland confirmed their first cases of swine flu <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2009-05-01">yesterday</TIMEX3> , bringing the total number of countries affected to 12 .
There have been 248 deaths linked to the virus in Mexico , with 12 confirmed .
The other countries affected are the United States , Canada , New Zealand , Germany , Spain , Israel and Austria .
