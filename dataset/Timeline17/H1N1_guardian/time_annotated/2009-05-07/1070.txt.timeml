Photograph : Carl de Souza\/AFP\/Getty Images Two new cases of swine flu have been diagnosed in the UK , one in a child , the health secretary , Alan Johnson , said <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2009-05-07">today</TIMEX3> .
The child is a pupil at one of the five schools that have already been closed due to the outbreak .
Johnson said there was no evidence of ` ` sustained '' person to person transmission of the virus in Britain .
But he warned in a Commons statement : ` ` This does remain a serious situation which could rapidly escalate . ''
The new cases bring the UK total to 34 .
Johnson told MPs an alternative quick - response system was being developed in case the outbreak escalates before a dedicated flu helpline is opened in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2009-FA">the autumn</TIMEX3> .
The exams regulator Ofqual was meeting <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2009-05-07">today</TIMEX3> to discuss contingency plans for pupils disrupted by the outbreak .
It is understood that children could sit exams elsewhere or , if they are sick with the virus , be awarded a grade based on papers or coursework they have completed .
Johnson and the chief medical officer , Sir Liam Donaldson , will give a further update on the outbreak <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2009-05-07" mod="END">later today</TIMEX3> .
Laboratory tests are being carried out on 390 people who may have the H1N1 virus , the Health Protection Agency said .
News of the latest cases came as South Hampstead high school , in north - west London , became the first of the five closed schools to reopen .
Four other schools Paignton community and sports college , in Devon ; Alleyn 's school , in Dulwich , south - east London ; Downend school , in south Gloucestershire ; and the private preparatory Dolphin school , in Battersea , south London remain closed .
GCSE exams began across the UK <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2009-05-07">today</TIMEX3> with a design and technology practical test , under the OCR board .
It was not known whether pupils at any of the affected schools were sitting this exam .
Schools hit by the illness are rescheduling exams or asking for special consideration for GCSE and A - level pupils .
A Department for Children , Schools and Families spokeswoman confirmed that officials were working with Ofqual and the exam boards to put in place contingency plans .
She said : ` ` Arrangements will be made on a case by case basis , so that all students are fairly treated .
Basing final results on other evidence , like coursework or modules already completed -LRB- also known as special consideration -RRB- , is just one contingency arrangement , and would only happen in specific circumstances where a student was unable to take a particular exam .
` ` This is a tried and tested system that exam boards use to award students grades if they are unable to take an exam for a given reason . ''
Alleyn 's school , which closed after <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="P5Y">five year</TIMEX3> seven pupils were diagnosed with swine flu on <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2009-05-04">Monday</TIMEX3> , said it was rescheduling A - level exams in art , biology and foreign languages for <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2009-W20">next week</TIMEX3> .
The government <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2009-05-07">today</TIMEX3> pledged # 6 m in aid to help poor countries in the global fight against swine flu .
The money from the Department for International Development will be given to the World Health Organisation and the UN for drugs , logistics and training to assist efforts to stop the spread of the virus and to prepare countries for a pandemic .
