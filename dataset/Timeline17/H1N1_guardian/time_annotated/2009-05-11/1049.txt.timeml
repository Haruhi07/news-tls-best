Patient developed symptoms on domestic flight from Beijing to Chengdu , in Sichuan , after traveling from the US <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2009-05-11">Monday</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2009-05-11">11 May 2009</TIMEX3> 13.41 BST A student <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> returned from the US has become mainland China 's first confirmed case of swine flu , prompting the Chinese authorities to try to quarantine all those who shared a flight with him .
The 30 - year - old patient , who has been named only as Bao , tested positive for the type - A H1N1 virus .
Up to 130 passengers who shared flights with the infected man are in isolation , the state news agency Xinhua reported , with authorities sending text messages to mobile phones nationwide asking those who had been on board the flights to report to the disease prevention bureau .
Bao arrived in Beijing on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2009-05-08">Friday</TIMEX3> having traveled home from America via Tokyo .
He developed symptoms on a domestic flight from Beijing to Chengdu , in Sichuan , the health ministry said .
He went to hospital and was transferred to the city 's infectious disease hospital after being found ` ` weakly positive '' for swine flu .

The country 's only previous confirmed case was a Mexican man who had traveled to Hong Kong .
Visa agents and the official Chinese visa service in the UK said people who had just visited Canada , Spain , Mexico or the US would have to wait <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P7D">seven days</TIMEX3> before applying for a Chinese visa .
But a foreign ministry press officer in Beijing said he was unaware of such a policy , and that any such change in procedure would have been announced .
Deng Haihua , a health ministry spokesman , told reporters that of the 233 people on board the flight from Tokyo , 106 were foreigners ; roughly a quarter of them were Japanese .
All but one of the passengers on the Beijing - Chengdu flight were from mainland China , Deng said .
` ` The local health authorities are doing their utmost <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> to try to track down these passengers , '' he said .
China has been accused in the past of not acting quickly enough to combat the spread of diseases , especially during the <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2003">2003</TIMEX3> global outbreak of Sars .
The Chinese authorities , chastened by that experience , have been accused of overreactingn to swine flu .
China 's response has drawn complaints from Mexico that its citizens were quarantined on the basis of their nationality alone .
The World Health Organisation <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2009-05-11">today</TIMEX3> confirmed that the virus has infected a total of 4,379 people across the world .
Its official tally , which tends to lag behind national reports but is also held to be more secure , includes 45 deaths in the disease epicentre , Mexico , two deaths in the US , and one each in Canada and Costa Rica .
