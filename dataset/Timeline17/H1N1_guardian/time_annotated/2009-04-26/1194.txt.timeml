Football matches went ahead without spectators ; theaters , shops and museums were closed ; staff were inside locked schools scrubbing classrooms with disinfectant ; and health workers patrolled buses , ordering sickly - looking people home .
Any doubts over the extent of the emergency were dispelled <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="TIME" value="2009-04-25TNI">last night</TIMEX3> by the sight of soldiers handing out blue surgical masks to pedestrians and motorists along Mexico City 's central boulevard , Paseo de la Reforma .
With TV and radio calling on the population to seek medical advice for any flu - like symptoms , queues grew at clinics and hospitals across the city .
Calder n said specialist laboratories in Canada had confirmed the outbreak was of a type of virus labeled A\/H1N1 not previously seen in pigs or humans .
Few of the cases appear to have had any contact with live pigs .
The WHO said the virus appeared to be able to spread from human to human and contained human virus , avian virus and pig viruses from North America , Europe and Asia .
Given how quickly flu can spread , there might be cases incubating around the world already , said Dr Michael Osterholm at the University of Minnesota : ` ` Hundreds and thousands of travellers come in and out -LRB- of Mexico -RRB- <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EVERY">every day</TIMEX3> . ''
At Mexico City 's international airport , passengers were questioned to try to prevent anyone with flu symptoms from boarding aircraft and spreading the disease .

US health officials took a similar line , urging visitors to wash their hands frequently .
