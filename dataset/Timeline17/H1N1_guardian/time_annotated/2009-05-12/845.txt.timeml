Swine flu could affect third of world 's population , says study Researchers say swine flu will spread around world within <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P9M">nine months</TIMEX3> , as UK confirms three more cases <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2009-05-12">Tuesday</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2009-05-12">12 May 2009</TIMEX3> 16.36 BST The swine flu virus will infect a third of the world 's population if it continues to spread at its <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> rate , scientists warned <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2009-05-12">today</TIMEX3> , as three more cases were confirmed in the UK .

In what the journal Science described as the ` ` first quick and dirty analysis '' of swine flu , a study by researchers at Imperial College London predicted the virus was likely to cause an epidemic in the northern hemisphere in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2009-FA">the autumn</TIMEX3> .
One of the authors , the epidemiologist and disease modeller Neil Ferguson , who sits on the World Health Organisation 's emergency committee for the outbreak , said the virus had ` ` full pandemic potential '' .
Speaking on BBC Radio 4 's <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2009-05-12">Today</TIMEX3> program , he said : ` ` It is likely to spread around the world in the next <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="P6M">six</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P9M">nine months</TIMEX3> , and when it does so , it will affect about one - third of the world 's population .
` ` To put that into context , normal seasonal flu probably affects around 10 % of the world 's population <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="SET" value="P1Y" quant="EVERY">every year</TIMEX3> , so we are heading for a flu season which is perhaps three times worse than usual not allowing for whether this virus is more severe than normal seasonal flu viruses . ''
The Health Protection Agency announced three more confirmed cases of the virus in the UK , bringing the total to 68 .
The three patients two children and one adult from London all had close contact with previously confirmed cases .
<TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2009-05-12">Today</TIMEX3> 's study estimated the contagiousness of the disease by analyzing the number of people traveling to Mexico who became infected , and comparing that with a study of a Mexican village where the disease has spread .
The research also examined how the virus was mutating .
It estimated that swine flu had killed between 0.4 % and 1.4 % of its victims in Mexico .
The report 's lead author , Christophe Fraser , said it was too early to predict what the death rate was likely to be outside Mexico .
` ` My hunch is that the death rate will be lower elsewhere Mexico has underlying issues with respiratory disease , '' he said .
The researchers said this H1N1 virus appeared to be about equal in severity to the flu of <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="1957">1957</TIMEX3> , and less severe than the deadly <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="1918">1918</TIMEX3> version .
` ` At the moment the virus is not spreading fast in the northern hemisphere because we are outside the normal flu season , but come <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2009-FA">the autumn</TIMEX3> it is likely to cause a really major epidemic , '' Ferguson said .
He declined to put an estimate on the number of deaths that may occur .
` ` We have some assessment , but the uncertainty is still quite broad , '' he said .
` ` We can say it is not going to be as catastrophic as the Spanish flu pandemic of <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="1918">1918</TIMEX3> , it is milder than that .
But it is still possible it could be -LRB- like -RRB- <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="1957">1957</TIMEX3> where about three to four out of 1,000 people who were infected died and overall about 3 million to 4 million people died that year because of the pandemic worldwide or it could be even milder than that , like the <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="1968">1968</TIMEX3> pandemic which was barely worse than a normal seasonal flu year .
` ` I am not predicting three million to four million -LRB- deaths -RRB- .
That was what happened in <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="1957">1957</TIMEX3> .
The world is a very different place <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2009-05-12">today</TIMEX3> .
There are more people in the world , but there is also a much better healthcare system .
We have drugs and vaccines , particularly in developed countries , which should markedly reduce the burdens of the disease . ''
Ferguson said the findings of the study confirmed that decisions must be taken swiftly on vaccine production .
` ` One of the key decisions which has to be made <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2009-W20">this week</TIMEX3> by the world community is how much do we switch over <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> vaccine production for seasonal flu to make a vaccine against this particular virus . ''
<TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2009-05-12">Today</TIMEX3> Cuba and Thailand confirmed their first case of the virus .
The patient in Cuba is a Mexican student at a medical school .
Fidel Castro accused Mexico of failing to disclose the spread of swine flu until after Barack Obama , the US president , had visited the country on <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="2009-04-16">16 April</TIMEX3> .
In a newspaper column , the former Cuban leader wrote : ` ` Mexican authorities did not inform the world of the presence -LRB- of swine flu
-RRB- , while they waited for Obama 's visit . ''
At least 61 people have been killed by swine flu around the world , and the WHO has confirmed about 4,800 cases .
