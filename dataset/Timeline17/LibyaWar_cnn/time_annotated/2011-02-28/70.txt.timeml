Three key Republican senators said <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2011-02-28">Monday</TIMEX3> they oppose a proposal by Sen. Joe Lieberman , I - Connecticut , to arm rebels in Libya fighting Moammar Gadhafi .
They had mixed thoughts on whether the United States should be involved in imposing a no - fly zone in that country to protect protestors from attacks by Libyan war planes .
I would not suggest either of those courses for the moment , said Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana , the top Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee who indicated U.S. involvement could lead to war .
Depending upon the method of delivery and what we decide to do we could decide to have a war in Libya to join the war in Afghanistan and Iraq .
Sen. Susan Collins , R - Maine , a member of the Armed Services Committee , said she would be leery of providing arms at this point but said she supports a no - fly zone .
I do believe our allies may be able to join together with us to enforce a no - fly zone over Libya to help protect the people from Gadhafi , she said .
Any actions that we take I believe should be in concert with our allies .
Sen. Lindsay Graham , R - South Carolina , who is also on the Armed Services Committee , credited the diplomatic efforts underway by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and suggested the U.S. work with the United Nations to stiffen and enforce sanctions against Libya .
Providing arms , I m not sure that helps us , Graham said .
I don t know if you could control <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3> who would get the arms .
What I would suggest is that we really keep implementing U.N. sanctions on the economic side , on the travel side , go after assets , Graham added .
And a no fly zone would make a lot of sense to me .
The three senators spoke in a Capitol hallway after a vote on the Senate floor .
<TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2011-02-28" mod="START">Earlier Monday</TIMEX3> , Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said he would withhold judgment on the idea from Lieberman , who made his comments <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2011-02-27">Sunday</TIMEX3> on CNN s State of the Union .
McConnell said he has asked Sen. John McCain , R - Arizona , the top Republican on the Armed Services Committee , to brief Senate Republicans at their weekly policy lunch in the Capitol <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2011-02-22">Tuesday</TIMEX3> about his trip to Egypt over <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2011-W08-WE">the weekend</TIMEX3> .
Lieberman traveled to Egypt with McCain , and they appeared together on CNN <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2011-02-27">Sunday</TIMEX3> .
McCain supported the idea of a no - fly zone but did not say if he supports providing arms to Libyans fighting Gadhafi .
A no fly zone is a UN scenario !

Lieberman works for another country and can not be trusted and starting another war is just another way Republicans think they can get out of creating jobs like they promised to get back in the house .

We ca nt even afford these other two wars we are fighting , and they are ready to get neck deep in Libya ?
These guys just do nt get it .

Mine is in the mail .
I hope and suggest other Christians avail themselves of the bracelets to counter the ` ` christian '' cons and their heresy .

Buy and wear a bracelet that says What Would Jesus Cut ?

Makeup your mind already .
You criticize the late response by Obama and wished he had done something sooner and <TIMEX3 tid="t36" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> You have a problem with siding with the rebels ?

If it had , Congress would declared war by <TIMEX3 tid="t43" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> , and U.S. troops would be ready to land .
Unfortunately , we ' ve been there , done that with Iraq already , but do n't put it past these oligarphic puppets to do it all over again .

The time has come for America and Americans to realize just like the brits had to that Gunboat diplomacy or in the US case the threat or actual execution of military intervention on whatever pretext in another sovreign nations affairs is very , very rarely justified or brings the result liked by the invader .
I must also add I ' m really fed up with the likes of Lieberman and McCain jumping in to criticise the Obama administrations handling of the Libya situation , even no fly zones because the British and German SAS and Airforces respectively were still rescuing thier nations people from outlying areas who worked in the Oil fields .
The kind of pre - emptive ideas of the above two and liberman sending arms risked leading to another embassy hostage crisis or other similar catastrophe .
Do they also realize that tens of thousands of non Libyans of mutiple nationalities are still trying to get out and cross borders to flee from a civil war .
A no fly zone might be realistically imposed thru the UN and NATO .
For the US to do it alone is not good policy unless you are among many -LRB- too many -RRB-
Republicans who think declaring war solves all diplomatic or revolutionary situations anywhere in the world .
Keep US arms and forces out of Libya !
The US has already bankrpted itself fighting unwinable wars in Afghanistan and Iraq we certainly have no need to arm rebels in Libya who could then sell or give the arms to anyone , or start using them against the UN .

McCain is the one who put the curse of Palin on our nation .
I seriously question his judgment on anything after choosing Palin .
Karl Rove even does nasty impressions of her making fun of her stupidity .
Why is it Republicans always want a military solution to everything ?
I love Secretary Gates comments to the West Point cadets that any Sec of Defense who suggests military action in southeast Asia or the Mideast to the President should have his head examined .
In the case of Rumsfeld , Cheney and Bush - they should be in jail for intentionally starting a fraudulent war in Iraq and breaking international war crimes law on torture .
The GOP proposed budget has been criticized by multiple Republican economists as killing up to 1.1 M jobs and destroying our economic recovery and Republicans acknowledge they know that but still want to ram it through .
Seems the GOP needs to have their collective heads examined on many issues .
They are not credible leaders .

Way to go folks ... ...
I would think that we have enough intelligence to know who to funnel assistance to in Libya .
To simply support the U.N. is unreal ...
this is the most incompetent organization on the face of the Earth next to the U.s . government ! !

Wow -- three GOP leaders that 's NOT following the advice of their leader Sarah Palin , who knows BEST about every issue that concerns the USA ! ! ! ! !
It 's OBVIOUS we should not provide ARMS
and it 's obviously difficult to impose a ` ` no - fly '' zone --
The guns will end up in the WRONG hands and the same guns and ; or bombs will end up blowing up ` ` friendly '' aircraft ! ! !
These GOP leaders are smarter than a fifth grader along with mostly every other American ! ! !
