By Ivan Watson , Raja Razek and Jomana Karadsheh , CNN Gadhafi backers rally in Zawiyah A boat with Libyan asylum - seekers is rescued off Lampedusa coast Warplanes launch sustained bombardgment of Tripoli suburb Libyan leader condemns foes in fiery speech Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- --
Fighting between Libyan rebels and government troops raged around the eastern Libyan oil town of Brega throughout <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2011-W28-WE">the weekend</TIMEX3> as NATO warplanes launched a sustained pre - dawn raid on Tripoli 's eastern suburbs .
Distant explosions shook windows in central Tripoli for <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="PT1H">more than an hour</TIMEX3> during the raid , launched <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="TIME" value="2011-07-17T01:00" mod="APPROX">about 1 a.m. Sunday</TIMEX3> .
NATO said later that the targets were warehouses full of Libyan tanks , troop carriers and ammunition in Tajoura , about 16 kilometers -LRB- 10 miles -RRB- from the city 's center .
The Western alliance has been bombarding Libya since <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2011-03" mod="END">late March</TIMEX3> a U.N. mandate to protect civilians from forces loyal to longtime strongman Moammar Gadhafi , who is attempting to put down a revolt against his nearly 42 - year rule .
The strike on Tajoura followed ` ` extensive intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance '' of the target , the allied command reported <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2011-07-17">Sunday</TIMEX3> .
According to NATO , ` ` the military equipment deployed from this facility was used to resupply pro - Gadhafi forces launching attacks on civilians . ''
A surface - to - air missile launcher and radar sites were also hit during the strike , which began shortly after <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="TIME" value="2011-07-17T24:00">midnight Sunday</TIMEX3> .
It was the first time in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="PXD">several days</TIMEX3> that the alliance targeted Tripoli and its immediate surroundings .
Food shortages in Western Libya <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2011-07-17">Sunday</TIMEX3> 's events followed a rally by mounted by pro - Gadhafi rallies in Zawiyah , west of Tripoli , where more than 10,000 portrait - waving demonstrators gathered amid a sea of green flags in the city 's cratered and pock - marked central square .
Zawiyah was the scene of intense fighting <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2010-WI">last winter</TIMEX3> , in the early days of the anti - Gadhafi uprising that has left this country bitterly divided .
Gadhafi 's forces eventually succeeded in capturing the city , but recovery appears to have barely begun in its war - torn heart .
Municipal buildings and a hotel overlooking the central square still stand gutted , windows broken and facades still singed by fires .
A vacant lot filled with sand marks the spot where a government minder said a mosque once stood .
The mosque was apparently completely bulldozed in the months since Zawiyah was re - captured .
The rooftop of a conference center was still littered with sandbags , bullet casings , several military helmets and bottles stuffed with rags apparently for use as petrol bombs -- evidence that rebels fought from this roof before their defeat <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2010-WI">last winter</TIMEX3> .
The demonstration in Zawiyah , less than a half - hour 's drive from the Libyan capital , was the third pro - Gadhafi rally in as <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="PXD">many days</TIMEX3> .
But unlike the previous rallies in the towns of Zlitan and Ajilat , there was a much larger security presence -- and members of the crowd were much more aggressive toward foreign journalists who were bused into the city by government minders .
The men , women and children who attended the rally , many of whom traveled by bus and car from nearby Tripoli , appeared fanatically devoted to Gadhafi .
` ` Allah , Moammar -LRB- Gadhafi -RRB- , Libya only , '' chanted many men and women , some of whom beat their chests in devotion as they repeated the slogan .
As he had in previous rallies , Gadhafi addressed his supporters with an audio message that denounced the rebel - held enclaves in the west , center and east of the country .
He also denounced the foreign governments that <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> declared the rebel Transitional National Council , based in the eastern city of Benghazi , as the sole legitimate government in Libya .
` ` You agents , you traitors , start looking for survival , '' Gadhafi said , in comments that were simulcasted on Libyan state TV .
` ` There will be no survival anywhere , get out of Benghazi , you traitors . ''
<TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2011-07-16">Saturday</TIMEX3> 's rally looked like a victory celebration as well as a declaration to Libya and the rest of the world that Zawiyah was <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> firmly in Gadhafi 's hands .
But there were signs Gadhafi 's forces still had concerns about security in Zawiyah .
A CNN journalist driving through the city hours before the rally officially took place saw security forces lining up three men who had apparently been detained against a wall .

And the reinforced presence included soldiers and police who used their vehicles to block off side roads leading to the main road running through the city .
