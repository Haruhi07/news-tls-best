Speaking to a state television reporter in front of his Tripoli home , Gadhafi said he wanted to show people ` ` that I am in Tripoli , not in Venezuela .
Do n't believe those dogs in the media . ''
His 40 - second appearance came after his government unleashed warplanes and helicopter gunships <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-02-21">Monday</TIMEX3> in an attempt to bottle up the revolt that captured Benghazi , the country 's second - largest city , over <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2011-W07-WE">the weekend</TIMEX3> .
Witnesses said the aircraft were attacking anti - government demonstrators around Tripoli , the capital .
Libya 's government denied it was turning its air force against civilians .
Gadhafi 's son , Saif Al - Islam Gadhafi , told the state news agency Al - Jamahirya the warplanes were targeting weapons depots in remote areas .
But one witness , who agreed to be identified only as ` ` Adam , '' said helicopters landed troops ` ` armed to the teeth '' in Tripoli 's Green Square on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011-02-21">Monday</TIMEX3> to scatter anti - government protesters with automatic weapons and grenades .
` ` They have been using aerial tactics , along with men on the ground , to disperse and shoot indiscriminately into crowds , '' he said .
The force included both government troops and mercenaries working for Gadhafi , he said .
But residents were responding by barricading themselves in their homes and setting up makeshift checkpoints to keep cars full of gunmen out of their neighborhoods .

Wedeman is the first Western television correspondent to enter and report from Libya during the crisis .
Meanwhile , Gadhafi 's regime faced defections from prominent officials who declared their solidarity with the Libyan people .
Justice Minister Mustafa Abdul Jalil resigned , saying he was protesting the ` ` bloody situation '' and ` ` use of excessive force '' against unarmed protesters , according to the Libyan newspaper Quryna .
And Libya 's deputy ambassador to the United Nations called the crackdown ` ` genocide , '' adding , ` ` The mass killing has reached a stage where no one can stay silent about it . ''

But Gadhafi ` ` can not survive '' this uprising , Dabbashi said .
` ` The Libyan people are determined to get rid of him .
It 's a matter of time .
I do n't know how long it will last , but it will be soon , '' he said .
