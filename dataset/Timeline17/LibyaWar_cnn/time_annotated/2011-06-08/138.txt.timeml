By Micah Zenko - Special to CNN
In the Washington Post , columnist Anne Applebaum asks - though does not directly answer - the important question , What to do About Libya s Stalemate ?
One position that she entertains is the notion that a stalemate is tolerable , and that it might even work .
A steady but relentless bombing campaign , generous humanitarian aid and training for the rebels , a bit of patience , and we re done with Gaddafi without too much fuss or boots on the ground .
Western -LRB- or certainly Arab League -RRB- political leaders might not discuss Libya often these days , but a stalemated civil war there is seriously problematic for five reasons : First , people are dying and the situation could worsen .
Before the civil war erupted , the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court , Luis Moreno - Ocampo , estimated that 500 to 700 persons had been killed in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2011-02">February</TIMEX3> alone when Libyan security forces had fired live ammunition .
Since then , deaths overwhelmingly committed by the regime have escalated though leveled off .
A Libyan rebel spokesperson estimated <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-W21">two weeks ago</TIMEX3> that at least 15,000 people had been killed , but reports of civilian deaths at the hands of regime forces have all but disappeared .
Given the motivations for revenge among both sides , however , the lull in violence directed at civilians could be short lived .
As the UN s International Commission of Inquiry on Libya concluded in its report <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-W22">last week</TIMEX3> , The Commission reached the conclusion that crimes against humanity and war crimes have been committed by the Government forces of Libya , and did find some acts which would constitute war crimes by opposition forces .
Second , one - sixth of the Libyan population of six million has been displaced .
Approximately 920,000 expatriate workers in Libya were forced to return to their home countries , with some 250,000 having since returned .
Sub - Saharan African workers have been targeted by rebel forces for arbitrary search and detention , as well as cruel and inhuman mistreatment .
As the International Commission of Inquiry report revealed : The most serious attacks on migrant workers appear to have been linked to a suspicion that such persons were mercenaries on the basis of their national origin or skin color .
According to UNHCR , at least another 100,000 people are believed to be internally displaced , though few aid agencies have a good picture of the situation in the Nafusa Mountains .
Third , humanitarian assistance is needed .
Applebaum identifies generous humanitarian aid as one precondition for stalemate giving way to success .
However , the international community has not been generous so far .
The UN issued its latest appeal for $ 407 million of critically needed humanitarian aid <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2011-W20">three weeks ago</TIMEX3> .
As of <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2011-06-08">today</TIMEX3> , all of the UN aid agencies in Libya have received less than half of the required funding in the form of either actual cash or pledges .
In much of the eastern part of the country , the aid situation has stabilized and commercial markets are functioning .
Nevertheless , as a UNHCR spokesperson stated <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2011-06-08">today</TIMEX3> :
An aid crisis could be looming It is apparent that the combined impact of protracted conflict and sanctions are eroding the government s ability to effectively deliver assistance .
Fuel shortages are compounding the worsening humanitarian situation throughout the country .
At one gas station in Tripoli , the lines stretched over five miles .
Fourth , most children are not attending school .
The National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- refuses to reopen schools .
Education officials from the NTC have said that schools will only reopen once Gadhafi has fallen , the curriculum is rewritten , and teachers sympathetic to the regime have been purged .
In the meantime , the NTC has put children to work cleaning streets , working as traffic cops and dishing up army rations to rebel soldiers , according to Dawn newspaper .
Meanwhile , the UN s International Commission of Inquiry reports that both government and opposition forces have used child soldiers in violation of international humanitarian law .
Finally , history and vast amounts of academic research demonstrate that the political upheaval caused by sustained civil wars decreases almost all socio - economic indicators , makes the eruption of post - conflict violence -LRB- including genocide and mass atrocities -RRB- much more likely , and often produces violence for export .
On the latter point , some officials , such as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , believe that Libya could become a breeding ground for Al Qaeda .
As she testified before Congress in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2011-03" mod="START">early March</TIMEX3> : Many of the Al Qaeda activists in Afghanistan and later in Iraq came from Libya and came from eastern Libya , which is <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> the so - called free area of Libya One of our biggest concerns is Libya descending into chaos and becoming a giant Somalia .
The possibility of Al Qaeda or its affiliates establishing a foothold in Libya has been overblown .
-LRB- One of the NTC s unbelievably one - sided public opinion polls asked Does Al Qaeda play a role in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2011-02-17">the 17th February</TIMEX3> Revolution ?
Allegedly , 94 percent of respondents said no .
-RRB-
Nevertheless , as the civil war stalemate persists , more and more young men learn the lethal tactics of warfare , forge ties with other fighters , and perhaps develop ambitions that can only be achieved through terrorism or violent goals beyond liberating Tripoli .
The views expressed in this article are solely those of Micah Zenko .

The reasons you listed are just common symptoms of civil war .
You could have just said : ` ` No civil war is tolerable '' .

Do n't you see what NATO is doing in Libya ?
It 's shelling the country day in and day out !
Jet fighters and drones dash through the sky .
Attack helicopters circle over Tripoli like annoying flies .
The western forces led by France and Britain want to oust Gaddafi .
The UN Resolution 1973 is no licence to kill him , however stubborn he is .
All these sorties are a cheap solution to resolve a conflict .
They might eventually lead to a military victory , yet spark moral disdain for France and Britain .

I could n't have said it better !

it 's all about power madness and kaddhafi is not a match .

The bottom line , is that the world is better off without Gaddafi around .
There is usually a price to pay for a long - term solution .
Any civilian casualties are , obviously , tragic .
However , I have been to LIbya twice .
This is a country that has been run in a mafia - like fashion for <TIMEX3 tid="t47" type="DURATION" value="P40Y">40 + years</TIMEX3> .
A very depressing place .
People in that country had no chance at freedom or any real life with ` ` The Leader '' in power and hoarding the fruits of the country for himself .
Everything comes with a price .
Many US citizens died in our country 's original push for freedom as well .
Why should we not lend our support -LRB- which is minimal at the time -RRB- for these people in their quest ... ?
<TIMEX3 tid="t50" type="DATE" value="2011-06-09">June 9 , 2011</TIMEX3> at <TIMEX3 tid="t52" type="TIME" value="2011-06-09T13:30">1:30 pm</TIMEX3> | You are so completely wrong , I do n't even know where to begin !
You seem to conveniently leave out the bit where Gaddafi mowing these people down with helicopter gunships while they were still unarmed protesters .
We all know who the REAL barbarian -LRB- not to mention sponsor of terrorism -RRB- is !

And where on EARTH did you get the RIDICULOUS idea that there is ` ` radiation from thier bombs '' ?
Do you understand anything about radioactivity ?
The only bombs which leave behind radiation are NUKES .
If we dropped one of those , this would be all over <TIMEX3 tid="t53" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> .
There is no residual radiation from the CONVENTIONAL weapons that are being used in Libya .
You are simply spreading ill - informed and ignorant propaganda !

They deserve what they get .
The East wanted NATO in , the West inTripoly wanted the Bengazi out .
The desert wind and sand will remedy all that .
Time will sort all that out .
That mob has been behaving like that since these places were just deserts .
Or , alqaeda may be in already for a new era .

Okay so you can use depleted Uranium -LRB- which cuts through metal easier -RRB- and after the bombing is over its not toxic at all ?
You can just throw it away anywhere ?

when UN let NATO IN the mess will all come back to us to suffer , look at the chemicals and radiations all will go to the planet -LRB- already said this will be the outcome before the bombing in <TIMEX3 tid="t77" type="DATE" value="2012-03">March</TIMEX3> -RRB-
Also Qadafy is no good leader of course .
But UN solution can only cause more harm looking into a bigger picture please ! !

Keep the fear level high and keep those mercenaries and our war machine employed .
Meanwhile , do your best to support every corrupt dictator that does what we tell them and save us from deficits by reducing support for Medicare , foreign aid , and sanity .

Have right and wrong completely disappeared ?
Do they know that people can see the truth through any amount of lies .
The man who outlawed FGM in Libya and in the African Union would never tell troops to rape women .
But apparently they would because they made that lie up .
Nice NATO , really nice .

Nato victims deserve financial compensation , a rebuild country and if the persons responsable were first punished and had to pay financially out of their own pocket and if everyone would stop glorifying war and killing and destruction and suffering and start respecting non violence and non war and stop electing war candidates and military politicians the problem may decrease and go away .

They should pay the most .
Each airstrike costs thousands of peoples 's lives .
Com plain as much as you want until the wars and Nato is stopped .
Remember that Nato is not only destroying govt and military infrastructure but civilian infrastructure , civilian lives , the whole country where it goes and causes millions of refuges trillions of dollars lost and world wide economic collapse so stopping Nato is necessary to saving the world .
Lawsuit Nato out of existence .

Ghadaffi stated from the get go that Al qaeda was invading his country and behind the unrest in Libya but if so , Al Aqeda in Libya sure did n't fire the first shot .
No , it was the Libyan military that fired the first shot and it was the Libyan military that started the civil unrest , the exodust and the humanitarian catastrophe and the bloodshed .
<TIMEX3 tid="t262" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">Recently</TIMEX3> a Libyan government spokesman argues that the Libyan people are the ones who should be deciding Libya 's future and not Nato .
And while I could n't agree with his statement more , I believe that is exactly what the Libyan people were trying to do at the getgo when the Libyan government started to attack and murder them .
And while the politicians in Washington continue to criticize this administration 's involvement in Libya , I believe that it must be noted that the Libyan unrest may have been resolved a lvery ong time ago if only the right wing radicals in Washington would allow president Obama to do his job .
And unfortunately , because of the widespread and ongoing criticism by the gop over US involvement in this UN mandated mission in Libya , president Obama had to prematurely scaleback our military involvement and give the lead way to Nato .

And maybe its the division in Washington that is encouraging Moammar Ghadaffi to try to hold on to power believing at the end , the gop would help him prevail .
That is the Party of No , the republican enemy of our state .
Just imagine if John Boehner and the hardline radicals in the gop knew about our mission to kill Bin Laden way in advance .
Perhaps Bin Laden would still be alive <TIMEX3 tid="t266" type="DATE" value="2011-06-08">today</TIMEX3> simply because John Boehner and the gop probably would have tipped he and the Pakistan government off .
But at the end , democracy prevailed and America prevailed because president Obama is the most articulate and the most intelligent commander in chief and president America ever had .

To write it off as a Religious maddess hardly explains it .
It is the response of people living in poverty , repressive governments , and under the thumb of American corporations .
We are not fighting Al Quada , we are fighting the people of these countries .
We use them as a reason to expand American influence and our land base , i.e. Afganistan and Iraq .
We classify the Taliban as ` ` Terrorist '' , who are fighting the invasion of their land , just as they did against the Russians .
As long as they were fighting Russians , they were heros .
Already we are trying to control the upcoming rebel government in Libya , saying it is important to stop Al Quada , all 10 - 12 of them .
We have to learn that it is the peoples of these countries -LRB- including Yemen -RRB- have the right to determine their own political structures .
So far President Obama is smart in that he is staying out of the country , however he actually has little control of the CIA or US Military .
Already it has paid off for the US in a massive oil deal with the Rebel Government , hopefully we continue to support , and not try to dominate and control .

Reply ` ` The possibility of Al Qaeda or its affiliates establishing a foothold in Libya has been overblown .
-LRB- One of the NTC s unbelievably one - sided public opinion polls asked Does Al Qaeda play a role in <TIMEX3 tid="t367" type="DATE" value="2011-02-17">the 17th February</TIMEX3> Revolution ?
Allegedly , 94 percent of respondents said no . -RRB- '' --
Micah Zenko
So the NTC - which is solely reliant on international assistance and who is desperately seeking recognition and piles of money - takes their own ` ` public opinion poll '' and reports that there is almost no influence from Al Queda , a group whose influence would surely mean the NTC meets none of its recognition and funding goals .
Well let me say I ' m shocked !
Not by the ridiculous results , but rather by just how utterly gullible this journalist Zenko could be to buy into those results .

here is your proof !
Libya : Former Guant namo detainee is training rebels A former detainee at Guant namo Bay has taken a leading role in the military opposition to Col Muammar Gaddafi , it has emerged , alongside at least one other former Afghan Mujahideen fighter .
Rebel recruits in the eastern port city of Derna are being trained by Sufyan Bin Qumu , a Libyan who was arrested following the US - led invasion of Afghanistan in <TIMEX3 tid="t407" type="DATE" value="2001">2001</TIMEX3> , and held at Guant namo for <TIMEX3 tid="t408" type="DURATION" value="P6Y">six years</TIMEX3> .
Abdel Hakim al - Hasidi , a senior Libyan rebel commander in Derna , was also held following the invasion of Afghanistan and handed over to Libyan custody <TIMEX3 tid="t409" type="DATE" value="2011-08">two months later</TIMEX3> .
Both men were said to have been released from prison in Libya in <TIMEX3 tid="t411" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> as part of a reconciliation process with Islamists in the country .
Mr Qumu , 51 , a Libyan army veteran , was accused by the US government of working as a truck driver for a company owned by Osama bin Laden , and as an accountant for a charity accused of terrorist links .
The appearance of Islamists in the country 's revolution , and supportive statements by Islamist groups , has led to fears that Western military action may be playing into the hands of its ideological enemies .
<TIMEX3 tid="t415" type="DATE" value="2011-W22">Last week</TIMEX3> Admiral James Stavridis , Nato 's Supreme Allied Commander , Europe , said that , while the Libyan opposition 's leadership appeared to be ` ` responsible men and women , '' US intelligence had detected ` ` flickers '' of terrorist activity among rebel groups .
The comments were described by British government sources as ` ` very alarming . ''
However , Islamists are said to form only a small minority within the rebel forces , and there is not said to have been any disagreement with the opposition 's political leadership , which says it is secular .
Mr Hasidi , who spent <TIMEX3 tid="t416" type="DURATION" value="PXY">several years</TIMEX3> in a training camp in Afghanistan , told a newspaper he does not support a Taliban - like state and is pursuing an ` ` inclusive ideology '' .
He said : ` ` Our view is starting to change of the US .
If we hated the Americans 100 per cent , <TIMEX3 tid="t417" type="DATE" value="2011-06-08">today</TIMEX3> it is less than 50 per cent .
They have started to redeem themselves for their past mistakes by helping us to preserve the blood of our children . ''
He has also called on foreign governments to supply rebels in Libya with Stinger surface - to - air missiles .
Mr Qumu has described the Nato - led bombing in Libya as a ` ` blessing '' .
Diplomatic cables from <TIMEX3 tid="t418" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> obtained by WikiLeaks , and initially revealed by The Daily Telegraph , identified Derna as a breeding ground for fighters for a number of causes , including Afghanistan and Iraq
The cables quoted a local businessman saying : ` ` The unemployed , disfranchised young men of eastern Libya have nothing to lose and are therefore willing to sacrifice themselves for something greater than themselves by engaging in extremism in the name of religion . ''

Since I am retired military and a former law enforcement officer I can tell you this conflict and this dictator in Libya is the Libyans business and not America , France or UK .
However because of all that oil it is apparent that we made it our business .
The reason that Quaddafi has not been taken out yet is because there is not as much support for the rebels as people have been led to believe and we are intentionally giving the so called rebels a chance to establish a pro - western government that is subservient to the U.S and other western countries .
The reason they want to legitmize the Traditonal council is so the so - called rebels can then give foreign troops permission to come into the country .
We have imported a expat libyan from Fairfax Virginia to lead their arm forces , we have imported a finance minister who has lived in the U.S. in Washington DC since <TIMEX3 tid="t447" type="DATE" value="1974">1974</TIMEX3> to manage all those billions of dollars in oil profits .

And your oil comment is a joke .
How much of Libya 's oil does the US import ?
About 3 % of their oil exports went to the US at its highest rate .
Such a tiny amount to the US as to be nonexistent .

And what about Iraq ?
We are just rolling in oil profits from the Iraqi war , right ?
BA ...
you are 100 % correct !
this was a regime change scheme by the nato forces from the git go !
they used any excuse they could find to try to remove gadaffi to steal LYBIA 'S OIL !
they know that the rebels are AL - QAEDA as I have just posted for the world to see !
it was the american DIPLOMAT IN LYBIA who IDENTIFIED these rebels as AL - QAEDA TERRORIST !
barack is KNOWINGLY defending AL - QAEDA to remove gadaffi .
then the nato forces are goingt o try to DOUBLE CROSS the al - qaeda rebels -LRB- since we know they are al - qaeda -RRB- and then install a puppet govt in that country to steal the resources of Lybia !
barack should be impeached AND TRIED FOR TREASON for defending these terrorist !

Our top three oil sources are Canada , Mexico , and Saudi Arabia .
Libya does n't even make the top 20 !
As for Terrorism , look no far than Gaddafi himself .
Besides backing Terrorists , and even setting their goals , he also engages in ASSASSINATING his critics worldwide .
Amnesty International has listed at least 25 assassinations between <TIMEX3 tid="t458" type="DATE" value="1980">1980</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t459" type="DATE" value="1987">1987</TIMEX3> for which Gaddafi is responsible .
His agents even have attempted to murder people on American soil .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t460" type="DATE" value="1980">1980</TIMEX3> , a Libyan agent attempted to assassinate dissident Faisal Zagallai , a graduate student at Colorado State University in Fort Collins , Colorado .
He survived the attach , but bullets partially blinded him .
Obama is an international statesman .
Gaddafi is a murdering lunatic .

BA , you make a lot of good points .
MAR , your views are in line with other interesting conspiracy theories , but you 're not even close .

So what if there are a couple of alleged ex Al Qaeda fighting with the the rebels ?
That deos n't mean Al Qaeda is taking over the country .
The Gaddafi opposition as a whole , is for real .

And , of course , the US would prefer a more western government in Libya .
Let 's not forget that the French and British are the ones behind most of the NATO offense at the moment .
In any event , I ' ve been to Libya twice very <TIMEX3 tid="t466" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> .
It 's a depressing place .
It 's been run in a mafia - like way for <TIMEX3 tid="t468" type="DURATION" value="P40Y">40 + years</TIMEX3> .
Gaddafi was most certainly butchering his own people indiscriminately , simply because they followed the Egyptians and waged peaceful protests .
He would not have stopped there either .
He would have gone on a witch hunt and murdered thousands more who he thought might have been connected with the protests .
Again , I respect your opinions , but you 're not entirely correct .

<TIMEX3 tid="t478" type="DATE" value="2011-06-09">June 9 , 2011</TIMEX3> at <TIMEX3 tid="t480" type="TIME" value="2011-06-09T16:30">4:30 pm</TIMEX3> | Reply I ' m not against the right when I criticize their relentless unjust attacks on the Obama administration for backing a legal UN mandate to protect the people of Libya .
I really do n't care if those in charge of America are Republican , Democrat or Independent as long as they are governing for the welfare , well being and progress of America and the American people and our interest abroad .
However , since president Obama has taken office the first thing that has happened is that the Tea Party has emerged on the political scene for the first time in <TIMEX3 tid="t481" type="DURATION" value="P100Y" mod="LESS_THAN">almost a hundred years</TIMEX3> just to question the legitimacy and citizenship of our nation 's first African - American president .
Then there 's the GOP who questions and opposed everything that the Obama administration tried to do to stabilize the economic crisis and move the country forward .
When the president introduced the economic stimulus package to stabilize the fragile American economy and prevent it from slipping into a catastrophic depression , the GOP stressed fiscal responsibility and accused the president of inflating the national deficit .
When the president asked for a jobs bill and extension of unemployment benefits for unemployed and struggling Americans , John Cornyn and Mitch MsConnel went on CNN <TIMEX3 tid="t483" type="DATE" value="2010-06-09T16:30">a year ago</TIMEX3> and sarcastically told Wolf Blitzer that the GOP can not support a jobs bill because if it were to create jobs , it would be a win for democrats .
Then they both chuckled .

But I was pleased when Wolf Blitzer replied , ` ` a win for Democrats or a win for the American people ? ''
Then during the same period <TIMEX3 tid="t487" type="DATE" value="2009-06-09T16:30">a year ago</TIMEX3> , who can forget Jim Bunning of Kentucky , blocking a jobs bill that brought a very important highway construction project in Washington DC and surrounding arears to an abrut halt as workers were told to pack up and go home .
And this defiant and selfish stance by Jim Bunning also put a hault to a very important unemployment and health insurance coverage for hundreds of thousands of unemployed and struggling Americans affected by this recession the GOP caused with their failed and misguided economic policies .

And Mr. Bunning argument for his stance was because he felt that the president was inflating the national deficit while he and his party sarcastically stressed ` ` fiscal responsibility '' once more .
Then when the president introduced the rail project slated for Florida , Florida 's governor turned down this project , arguing that he was concerned that federal funding may have exceeded the cost of the project .
And in the process of rejecting this project , thousands of prospective American jobs got automatically canceled .

Yet , the GOP still keep asking sarcastically ` ` where are the jobs . ''
Then remember the oil spill desaster ?

Well , when president Obama took office and appropriated federal funds to aid American states afflicted by the recession , Louisiana governor Bobby Jindel said his state did n't need any aid .

But when small businesses were affected by the oil spill desaster desaster , Governor Jindel was the first to argue that federal aid was not forth coming and he and the GOP sternly criticized the president and accused the president of not holding BP responsible for compensation the victims in the gulf .

But when the president got BP to set up a 20 billion dollar fund to compensate the victims , Rep Joe Barton of Texas accused the president of ` ` a shake down '' of BP .
As they say , damn if you do , damn if you do n't .

And when it comes to foreign affairs , the GOP has been against America too .
For example , when the president set a deadline in <TIMEX3 tid="t493" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3> to bring our troops home from Iraq , the GOP argued that the president was sending the wrong message to the enemy , although the enemy is question never existed before our illegitimate invasion and destabilizing of Iraq .
The same is to be said of Afghanistan and <TIMEX3 tid="t494" type="DATE" value="2011-06-08">today</TIMEX3> we are still suffering casualties in Afghanistan because that war was prolonged to begin the Iraqi war .
And since the Libyan mission , many in congress have asked what is the mission in Libya and what is the end game in Libya ?
However , my question to the critics is when is the end game in Iraq and Afghanistan and what is the mission there ?

And where are the WMD 's ?
Furthermore , let me add that while many in congress criticize the Obama administration for our involvement in Libya by asking what is the end game there , it was president Obama who had to decide the end game for both the Iraq and Afghan wars <TIMEX3 tid="t496" type="DATE" value="202">a decade later</TIMEX3> when he set a deadline to begin troop withdrawal and the president has kept to his promise as troop withdrawal from Iraq began <TIMEX3 tid="t495" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">a few months ago</TIMEX3> .
Remember the crisis in Egypt ?
Yea , the GOP and the mainstream media argued that president Obama was n't doing enough to defuse that crisis although the president had publicly called on Hosni Mubarak repeatedly to work towards a speedy transion and democratic changes .
And at the end of the day , while some in the GOP and mainstream media argued that president Obama was not doing enough to help thye people of Egypt , others like Newt Gingrich argued that president Obama was betraying a friend in Hosni Mubarak and supporting a terrorist group , the Muslim Brotherhood by calling on Hosni Mubarak to cater to the demonstrators ' demands .
And at the onset of the Libyan crisis , the GOP and the mainstream media accused the president of dragging his feet and not coming to the aid of the Libyan people who they said were being slaughtered by Ghadaffi .
But when the president intervened with military intervention via a legal unilateral UN mandate , the same GOP and the mainstream media without a sense of moral integrity and common decency , deliberately flipped flopped on the issue and accused the president of rushing to war in Libya .
<TIMEX3 tid="t500" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> they say that president Obama is not doing enough to defuse the crises in Yemen and Seria .
You ' ve got to be kidding right ?

No , I do n't deslike the Republicans in America but I deslike the fact that they are anti - America and their only wish seems to be wanting to see the president of the United States and the country fail because they have a problem with the color of the president 's skin .
I ' m not for or against any political party in Washington , I ' m just for America .
Its that plain and simple .
It 's either you 're for America or against America and so far , the GOP and the mainstream republican owned and operated media and press seem to be enemies of the state .

the answer is simple .
he knows that whatever he tells congress will be a lie and he will get impeached !
he is holding out all hope that gadaffi gets killed so that he can tell whatever lie that he wants too tell .
that wo nt help him at all because the real citizens of Lybia will not allow the same al - qaeda terrorist who we are defending take over the country !

The longer the war goes on the more questions will be asked in media and public about US involvement and real motives 2 .
The longer the war and the more casulties , the harder it will be for US to organize next insurrection in next country it targets 3 .
The longer the war the more delay in installing puppet government and claiming lybia oil 4 .
The longer the war , the more it costs , both for US army and rebels it is funding 5 .
The longer the war the more hope for US next victim that it may successfully defend itself .

The sad truth is Obama has proven by his acts to be nothing but a puppet of Dick Cheney and the neo - con right .
All of Obama 's policies and secret agendas that have produced political unrest and revolution across the mid east are actually just part of Cheney 's original plan for regime change .
Cheney started with Afghanistan and Iraq , and Obama added Pakistan , Libya , Egypt , Tunisia , and a half dozen other countries like Yemen and Syria .
Obama 's policies DO NOT reflect the will of the people who voted for him .
In this respect , he is no different than Gadhafi , Mubarak , or Assad .

I will remember the TV news videos of those Libyan ` ` civilians '' riding around in white pickup trucks with giant machine guns mounted in the back .
I remember seeing the ` ` civilians '' brandishing AK-47s and RPGs .
I heard early reports that those civilians had advanced on the opposition and had taken territory in some locations .
These are not things that civilians do , they are things that paid militias and mercenaries do .
It 's all just badly exposed work of the CIA .
All of the above listed ` ` civilian '' activities made people in Gaza legitimate targets when Israel invaded .
I assume this is why the Goldstone report on Israel 's invasion of Gaza was ` ` recinded '' in an op - ed just prior to the events in Libya .
Obviously the West ca n't allow the appearance of a double standard by acting against Gadhafi for doing basically the same thing that it let Israel off the hook for .
