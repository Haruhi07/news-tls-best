CNN -RRB- --
The mother of a woman who burst into a Tripoli hotel to tell journalists that she had been beaten and raped by troops loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi said <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2011-03-28">Monday</TIMEX3> that her daughter is still being held .
Her claim contradicts an earlier statement from the government , which has said that Eman al - Obeidy was released and is at home with her family .
` ` <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-03-27">Yesterday</TIMEX3> , late at night at <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="TIME" value="2011-03-27T03:00">3 a.m.</TIMEX3> , they called me from Bab al Aziziya , ''
Gadhafi 's compound in Tripoli , al - Obeidy 's mother told Al - Jazeera television <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2011-03-28">Monday</TIMEX3> .
` ` And they told me : Make your daughter Eman change her statement ... and we will release her immediately and whatever you ask for you will get , whether money , or a new apartment , or guaranteeing financial security for you and your children .
But just tell Eman to change her statement . ''
A government spokesman said <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2011-03-27">Sunday</TIMEX3> that al - Obeidy had been released and was with her family .
Spokesman Moussa Ibrahim said then that al - Obeidy and her family were asked if they wanted to be interviewed by ` ` one or two , preferably female , reporters to verify that she 's fine , she 's healthy , she 's free with her family . ''
He refused to take further questions on the issue , repeatedly stating that Libyan society is ` ` very conservative . ''
Marriage for woman allegedly raped Cousin : ` She did n't look like herself ' A group of lawyers and human rights activists tried to approach Al - Obeidy 's sister 's house <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2011-03-28">Monday</TIMEX3> , but were blocked by security forces .
The sister 's mobile phone has apparently been turned off , a source with the opposition in Tripoli told CNN , and no one has seen her since the incident at the hotel .
The family of al - Obeidy said she is a lawyer -- and not a prostitute or mentally ill as Libyan government officials initially said after the incident .
The government has since changed its story , saying she is sane and pursuing a criminal case .
Al - Obeidy 's father told Al - Jazeera that his daughter ` ` has her full mental capabilities and she is a graduate of law school and a lawyer and she is pursuing higher education in Tripoli .
And she was kidnapped by Gadhafi 's tyrannical forces . ''
` ` I am not ashamed of my daughter , '' al - Obeidy 's mother , who spoke from an undisclosed location in Libya , told the network .
` ` I am proud of her because she has broken the barrier .
She broke the barrier that no man can break .

And those dogs there with him , Moammar , -LRB- are -RRB- the criminals ! ''
She urged the youth of Libya to take action .
Al - Obeidy burst into a Tripoli hotel as international journalists were having breakfast <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="TIME" value="2011-03-26TMO">Saturday morning</TIMEX3> .
Her face was bruised , as were her legs .
She showed reporters blood on her right inner thigh .
Speaking in English , she said she was from the rebel stronghold of Benghazi and had been held against her will for <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P2D">two days</TIMEX3> and raped by 15 men .
Though her injuries appeared consistent with what she said , CNN could not independently verify al - Obeidy 's story .
` ` Look at what Gadhafi 's brigades did to me , '' she said .
` ` My honor was violated by them . ''
Al - Obeidy displayed what appeared to be visible rope burns on her wrists and ankles .
Government officials tried to stifle her , but she persisted .
Security forces moved to subdue her , and even a member of the hotel 's kitchen staff drew a knife .
Another staffer tried to throw a dark tablecloth over her head .
One government official , who was there to facilitate access for journalists , pulled a pistol from his belt .
Others scuffled with reporters and wrestled them to the ground in an attempt to take away their equipment .
Some journalists were beaten and kicked .
CNN 's camera was confiscated and deliberately smashed beyond repair .
As security forces subdued the screaming woman and dragged her away , al - Obeidy warned , ` ` If you do n't see me <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2011-03-29">tomorrow</TIMEX3> , then that 's it . ''
