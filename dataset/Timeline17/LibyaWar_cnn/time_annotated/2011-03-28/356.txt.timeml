CNN -RRB- --
Once called the ` ` mad dog of the Middle East , '' Libya 's often flamboyantly dressed ruler , Moammar Gadhafi , has ruled the north African nation for <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P42Y">42 years</TIMEX3> .
But Libya 's 679,362 square miles and 6.4 million people have rarely seemed enough for Gadhafi , who in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> gathered a group of African tribal leaders and had them grant him the lofty title , ` ` King of Kings . ''
It was part of his campaign for a unified Africa -- a single federation with a million - man army at its disposal -- a nation that he , naturally , would serve as president , said Ronald Bruce St. John , the author of seven books on Libya .
` ` The Libyan stage is not enough of a playhouse for Gadhafi .
It never has been , '' St. John said .
Gadhafi 's ` ` King of Kings '' ploy was only another in a string of efforts by the mercurial leader to secure a larger - than - life place for himself on the world stage , efforts that have frequently landed him and his citizens in the harsh glare of an angry international community , according to St. John .
Gadhafi 's growing anger over the rejection of Arab and African leaders and his own growing anti - Western sentiment led him to turn to terrorism in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="197">the 1970s</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="198">1980s</TIMEX3> , said Dirk J. Vandewalle , a Libya expert at Darmouth University .
It led to the infamous bombing of a Pan Am flight over Lockerbie , Scotland , in which 270 people died .
` ` Terrorism was a cheap way to get even with the West , '' Vandewalle said .
Gadhafi , who will turn 69 in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2011-03">March</TIMEX3> , seized control of Libya in the very place where the <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> tumult seems strongest , the city of Benghazi .
As an Army captain , he led a bloodless coup against King Idris on <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="1969-09-01">September 1 , 1969</TIMEX3> , establishing the Libyan Arab Republic in just <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="PT2H">two hours</TIMEX3> , according to GlobalSecurity.org , an independent provider of security information .
He established a putative system of direct democracy called Jamahiriya that supposedly allowed the nation 's citizens direct input into their government , St. John said .
In reality , the country was sliding into a dictatorship led by Gadhafi , he said .
In taking control of the country , he became one of a number of young revolutionaries in the region carrying a strong message of Arab nationalism in the mold of Egyptian President Gamel Abdel Nasser , Vandewalle said .
Although U.S. leaders initially tried working with Gadhafi , it quickly became clear he was an Arab nationalist and relations with the West quickly deteriorated , St. John said .
By <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="1972">1972</TIMEX3> , he was urging Muslims to fight Western powers , including the United States and Great Britain , and backing black militants in the United States as he pursued a leadership position in the Arab world , seeking to succeed his political idol , Nasser , who had died in <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="1972">1972</TIMEX3> .
But Arab leaders shunned his responses , Vandewalle said , seeing him more as a ` ` buffoon '' and a ` ` clown '' than a potential pan - Arab leader .
That rejection , his own growing anti - Western sentiment and a lack of criticism within the tightly controlled Libyan political environment led Gadhafi to turn to terrorism , Vandewalle said .
` ` I think it was frustration more than anything else , '' he said .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="1986">1986</TIMEX3> , Libya was implicated in the fatal bombing at a West Berlin nightclub that left one American service member dead , prompting U.S. President Ronald Reagan to dub the Libyan leader the ` ` mad dog of the Middle East . ''
The United States bombed targets in Libya in response and imposed economic sanctions .
<TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="1988">Two years later</TIMEX3> , Libya was implicated in the <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="1988">1988</TIMEX3> bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 , which exploded over Lockerbie , Scotland .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="1999">1999</TIMEX3> , seeking rapprochement with the West , Gadhafi succumbed to Western demands to turn over suspects in the Lockerbie bombing , and in <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2003">2003</TIMEX3> the country agreed to eliminate weapons of mass destruction .
The moves helped the country regain diplomatic relations with the United States in <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2006">2006</TIMEX3> , but that was n't the end of Gadhafi 's touchy relations with foreign nations .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> , Swiss officials jailed one of Gadhafi 's sons , prompting the furious leader to cut off the country 's oil supplies , withdraw the country 's money from Swiss banks and threaten to cut off diplomatic relations .
And in <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3> , Libya and Gadhafi again became the subject of international ire in <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3> when the government granted a hero 's welcome to Abdel Basset al - Megrahi , who had been convicted in the Lockerbie bombing but was released by Scottish authorities for health reasons .
While his politics have brought the attention of international leaders , it may be Gadhafi 's personal style that has brought him the most awareness around the world .
Gadhafi is known for appearing in public in outrageous , sometimes outlandish , garb , St. John said .
Images of the Libyan leaders available on the Internet show him dressed in everything from lavishly decorated military uniforms to animal prints .
Gadhafi famously travels with a traditional Bedouin tent , whose appearance in 2009 frustrated officials in Bedford , New York , when he came to New York to address the United Nations .
He also travels with a retinue of female bodyguards , St. John noted .
While Gadhafi has a substantial number of enemies within Libya , his use of the county 's enormous oil revenues to provide subsidized health care , education and housing to citizens , as well as his willingness to stand up to the West , granted him a reserve of good will that he still draws on <TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="DATE" value="2011-03-28">today</TIMEX3> , said Vandewalle .
` ` This was a young nationalist who stood up to the West , who nationalized the oil companies , who stood up to Great Britain and the United States , '' Vandewalle said .
` ` It was highly symbolic and there are a number of people there who still grudgingly respect him for that . ''
