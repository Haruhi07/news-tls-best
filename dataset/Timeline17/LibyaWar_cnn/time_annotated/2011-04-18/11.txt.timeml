The nightmare in Libya 's war - torn city of Misrata intensified <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2011-04-18">Monday</TIMEX3> amid more shelling on the city and desperate measures to get medical care , an opposition spokesman said .
` ` The aid coming from outside is not enough .
There is no hospital , '' said the spokesman , who wanted to be identified only as ` ` Mohammed '' for safety reasons .
He said 23 people were killed and 104 were injured in shelling <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-04-17">Sunday</TIMEX3> in Misrata .
Another person was killed and nine were injured <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2011-04-18">Monday</TIMEX3> , Mohammed said .
` ` The shelling and destruction by Gadhafi 's forces has not stopped since <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011-04-17">yesterday</TIMEX3> , '' he said .
` ` They are shelling mortar shells , cluster bombs and splinter mortar shells .
The splinter mortar shells explode and throw lethal shrapnel , which has caused most of the tragedies . ''
Conflict continues in Misrata , Libya Gadhafi accused of using illegal weapons The shelling was happening around residential and industrial areas of Misrata , the witness said .
<TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2011-04-18">Monday</TIMEX3> 's shelling also fell on the city 's critical port area , Misrata 's lifeline to humanitarian aid .
With a city hospital taken over by pro - government forces , makeshift clinics have popped up to treat the wounded .
And in a city where access to food , water and electricity has been scarce , Mohammed said , people have been using cell phones for light during surgery . ''
-LRB-
With -RRB- all of this happening , we have n't seen NATO , '' Mohammed said , referring to the alliance that has led airstrikes against Libyan ruler Moammar Gadhafi 's military resources .
` ` There have been no strike for <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P4D">four days</TIMEX3> in Misrata . ''
Misrata residents are ` ` disappointed and let down '' by NATO , he said .
` ` They hear NATO flying above , but Gadhafi 's forces do not run from them anymore .
Gadhafi 's forces are not threatened by NATO anymore .
The NATO planes are circulating as the destruction continues . ''
As the battle between pro - Gadhafi forces and rebels demanding an end to Gadhafi 's four - decade rule forges ahead , a United Nations official said <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2011-04-18">Monday</TIMEX3> that her meeting with Gadhafi regime members did not end with a promise to stop attacks .
Valerie Amos , U.N. under - secretary - general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator , spoke to reporters <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2011-04-18">Monday</TIMEX3> in the Libyan rebel stronghold of Benghazi .
She said she visited Gadhafi regime officials in Tripoli on <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2011-04-17">Sunday</TIMEX3> .
` ` Let me be absolutely clear .
I got no guarantees with respect to my call for the overall cessation of hostilities to enable people to move , to enable us to deliver supplies , '' Amos said .
` ` I did get an assurance from the government to carry out a needs assessment in Misrata . ''
She added , ` ` I have to say , in that instance , we got no guarantees at all that the violence would cease . ''
Britain will help 5,000 people trapped in Misrata ` ` escape the besieged city and will provide vital medical assistance to those who remain in towns across western Libya , '' the UK Mission to the United Nations announced <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2011-04-18">Monday</TIMEX3> .
The evacuations ` ` will get foreign workers who have managed to reach Misrata 's port safely out of the town , '' the mission said in a statement .
Meanwhile , a British official met with U.N. leaders <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2011-04-18">Monday</TIMEX3> to discuss the humanitarian crisis in Libya .
` ` Agencies working inside -LRB-
Misrata -RRB- report shortages of critical supplies and attacks targeted against civilians and medical facilities , '' according to a statement from the UK 's Department for International Development .
The statement said International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell would travel to the United Nations for ` ` urgent talks '' <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2011-04-18">Monday</TIMEX3> .
Misrata is n't the only city deluged by violence .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2011-04-17">Sunday</TIMEX3> , forces loyal to Gadhafi shelled the city of Ajdabiya from 40 - 50 kilometers -LRB- 25 - 31 miles -RRB- away , Libyan rebel spokesman Shamsiddin Abdulmolah said .
The loyalists who were targeting the city ` ` have no problem with the weather conditions there , '' referring to unconfirmed reports that NATO airstrikes were halted in the area due to weather conditions .
Gadhafi 's forces were using missiles and mortars , ` ` and sometimes we feel that NATO wants to use any excuse out there so they do n't carry out their duties , '' Abdulmolah said .
` ` We ca n't understand -LRB-
NATO 's -RRB- excuses .
We want to save our population from being murdered by -LRB-
Gadhafi 's -RRB- merciless death squads , '' he added .
NATO did not immediately respond to a CNN inquiry about its operations <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2011-04-17">Sunday</TIMEX3> .
Earlier , however , the NATO press office said that it does not discuss ongoing operations and would not confirm or deny any reports .
An official report from NATO said the alliance conducted 142 sorties on <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2011-04-16">Saturday</TIMEX3> , of which 42 were strike sorties .
NATO is operating under a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing the use of force to protect Libyan civilians .
The alliance has said Gadhafi 's forces started hiding resources in civilian areas , making airstrikes much more difficult to carry out without harming civilians .
Misrata remained in control of the rebels <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2011-04-17">Sunday</TIMEX3> , Abdulmolah said , though they were fighting about 200 to 300 Gadhafi troops inside the city .
Rebel fighters pushed Gadhafi 's squads back to a shoe factory , from where they were shelling residential areas in the city , he said .
NATO refused to bomb the shoe factory because it is a civilian facility , he said .
In the end , the rebels pushed the loyalists out of the shoe factory , which they burned .
Despite the incessant struggle , Abdulmolah said he was optimistic the rebels could overcome Gadhafi 's forces .
` ` We are confident that we will be able to liberate the city completely and rescue our civilians who are being targeted by the madness of Gadhafi 's death squads , '' he said .
