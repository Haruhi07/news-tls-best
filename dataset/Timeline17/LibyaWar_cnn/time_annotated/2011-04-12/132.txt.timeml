The fact that the Russians were to be first in space is truly amazing .

After WW2 all the German scientists , except for a handful who went to Great Britain , came to the U.S. and assisted us in our quest to go to space , whereas the Russians had no such assistance .
I ' m still quite amazed .
Although the US took the lion 's share of the scientists and records from Germany , Russia got their share of spoils in the way of scientists and records .
Helmut Gr ttrup from Germany 's V-2 rocket program was moved to Russia after WWII is the first name to come to mind .
Dimitri Ustinov Korolyov is the mastermind of the former Soviets ' space program , who developed the technology from captured German records with the help of Gr ttrup .
Russia , just like every other major power following WW2 , used captured -LRB- not stolen , since it 's considered spoils of war -RRB- technology to get them where there are <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2011-04-12">today</TIMEX3> .
Good post , George .
Do n't let these right - wing propagandists here fool you .
Remember Operation Paper Clip ?
That 's when the FBI went into Germany after WW2 to give some of these German scientists and engineers who were war criminals phoney IDs to get them out of Germany and over here to assist in our space and weapons programs .
In fact , if Germany chose to to start a Manhatten project of their own before WW2 they would have been the first to have a nuclear weapon .

With the C.I.A. it 's hard to tell these days .

We house and trained astronauts here !
We have been the eyes in the sky watching over these men and women for years .
Allow us this opportunity !
ABC is reporting Houston is not gettin on ... what a joke ...
Bet Kennedy gets one .

Do you know something I do n't know ?
Why are you still amazed ?
What 's your reasoning ?
I ' m truly curious ...
Of COURSE Kennedy gets one , that s where we LAUNCH from !
I think houston should get Endeavour , Kennedy is getting Atlantis , and Discovery should go to the Smithsonian .
I believe sending a shuttle to the Smithsonian was a given .
Giving one to Kennedy Space Center also another no brainer .
But just as obvious was leaving one at Johnson Space Center in Houston ...
the Space City .
The space program is so engrained and entrenched in the fabric of Houston and JSC that the city adopted the nickname in the 60 's .
Our basketball team is the ROCKETS ; the baseball team is the ASTROS !
If politics was the basis for this short - sighted decision , better political capital could have been gained with at least sending it to Ohio ...
a swing state in the forthcoming election .
This momentous day -LRB- 50th anniversary of manned space flight & 30th anniversary of the shuttle launch -RRB- is <TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> sullied .

The date in my last post is ` ` planned invasion on 11 - 02 - <TIMEX3 tid="t45" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3> . ''
this justifies the fact that Libya is invaded not because the man who turned deserts into productive farmlands and sleeps in tents like a camper is the wrong one in this imperialist racist crisis in libya .
Truth is Mr. kadhafi is a leader for his people .
Mubarak and ben ali along with the long list of the arab league were and or are leaders against their own people .
This make col .
Kadhafi and his people victims of another iraq type from , u know where !
He gives his best the thieves are trying to take away and give to their rich lobbysts !

That 's OK , Tomas .
It 's still good posting .
I get so sick and tired of all these ignorant fools blogging in here in favor of the uncalled for intervention in Libya .
