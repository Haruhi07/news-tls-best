In hospital in Yefren , a 9 - year - old girl may lose her arm White House OKs two more drones for Libya Most of Zawiya is in ` ` rebel hands , '' commander says Snipers , shelling are in the east of the city Zawiya , Libya -LRB- CNN
-RRB- --
Rebel fighters in Libya , trying to take over a key western city , faced stiff resistance from Moammar Gadhafi 's forces on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-08-17">Wednesday</TIMEX3> , a rebel commander said .
The fighters hope to seize Zawiya , about 30 miles west of the capital , in an effort to advance on the capital of Tripoli in their fight to topple the Gadhafi regime that has controlled the North African country for decades .
` ` Most of Zawiya is <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> in rebel hands , but there are snipers and shelling coming from the east of the city , '' rebel commander Col . Radwan Fheid said .
` ` The snipers are near Zawiya hospital .
They ca n't stay because of the shelling .
These are <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011-08-17">the last days</TIMEX3> , God willing . ''
Rebels are setting up checkpoints and field hospitals to treat the wounded , many of whom have been shot or struck by shrapnel .
At a hospital in nearby Yefren , doctors said they had treated more than 200 patients <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P4D" mod="MORE_THAN">over the past four days</TIMEX3> -- some of them rebel soldiers from any of several front lines , some of them civilians .
Among the latter was a 9 - year - old girl who was in her house when it was hit by a missile , sending shrapnel into her , a doctor said .
` ` Unfortunately , there is more than 90 % chance that she may lose her right arm here , '' he said .
Medical staff said they were donating their own blood to keep their patients alive .
One man , both legs wrapped in bandages , cried out in pain .
Doctors said there were not enough staff members to properly take care of the patient load .
Zawiya is west of Tripoli on a strategic supply route .
Rebel control of Zawiya would represent a major advance toward putting a stranglehold on the Gadhafi - controlled seat of power .
Col . Ahmed Banni , military spokesman for the opposition National Transitional Council , said <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2011-08-16">Tuesday</TIMEX3> that rebels hope to enter the capital by the end of the month .
The Obama administration has agreed to a NATO request for two additional Predator drones to conduct operations over Libya , a U.S. defense official said <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2011-08-17">Wednesday</TIMEX3> , <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> after the drones began flying .
The United States has earmarked up to six drones for the Libya operation in <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent months</TIMEX3> , although until generally only two drones have flown at any one time ; some have been armed with missiles .
In Washington , the Libyan Embassy was officially re - opened <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2011-08-17">Wednesday</TIMEX3> by its ambassador amid a crowd of proud Libyan Americans waving flags and singing Libyan songs .
` ` This embassy will serve as a symbol of the new Libya here in the U.S. , '' Ambassador Ali Aujali said outside the Watergate building in Washington where the embassy is located .
` ` We will work tirelessly not only to serve the needs of the Libyans studying , living and traveling in this country , but also to thank the United States government on behalf of the Libyan people everywhere for its continuing support for transition to a free and democratic nation . ''
The mission <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> represents the Transitional National Council -LRB-
TNC -RRB- , the rebel movement based in Benghazi , that the United States recognized as the rightful government of Libya on <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2011-07-15">July 15</TIMEX3> .
The embassy was closed in <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2011-03">March</TIMEX3> after the State Department expelled all diplomats loyal to Gadhafi .
Aujali , who previously represented the Gadhafi regime in Washington , resigned his post in <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2011-02">February</TIMEX3> , and has since represented the TNC in Washington .
He was formally accredited as head of the Libyan mission <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2011-W32">last week</TIMEX3> .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2011-08-16">Tuesday</TIMEX3> , Col . Roland Lavoie , a spokesman for NATO 's military operation , said that ` ` anti - Gadhafi forces are <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> assuming control of the key approaches to Tripoli . ''
He described the advances as ` ` the most significant anti - Gadhafi territorial gain we have seen in months . ''
Since <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="2012-07" mod="END">the end of July</TIMEX3> , as the threat from pro - Gadhafi forces has diminished , thousands of people have returned to their homes in the western Nafusa mountains , he said .
Since <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="2011-08-12">Friday</TIMEX3> , the northwest coastal city of Misrata has been free of pro - Gadhafi forces , he said .
And the threat from nearby Zlitan has diminished as pro - Gadhafi forces are being pushed farther west , he added .
Lavoie said rebels had occupied Surman and Sabratha west of Tripoli but added that the regions were ` ` still contested . ''
However , Libyan state television reported that pro - Gadhafi forces and tribal fighters were ` ` cleansing the city of Sabratha from the gangs of traitors '' and had secured the coastal road , a key supply pipeline into Tripoli .
Though the center of Zawiya was under rebel control , ` ` there 's still reports of fighting also in the suburbs , '' Lavoie said .
A spokesman for the Gadhafi government offered a different view on <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="2011-08-16">Tuesday</TIMEX3> .
` ` We are doing very well , '' Ibrahim Musa said .
` ` It 's true that it 's a bit slow ; people are still saying that we 're not acting immediately and that we 're having problems in Surman and Sabratha and whatnot because of armed gangs .
That 's true , but , God willing , we are able to lead this battle successfully .
We will achieve peace and victory . ''
He added , ` ` We are fighting NATO , not the tens or hundreds of armed gang members .
Our war is with the crusaders . ''
