Tunisia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- U.S. military planes headed for Cairo took off from Tunisia <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-03-05">Saturday</TIMEX3> , evacuating Egyptians fleeing the Libyan conflict , a deadly war spurring a massive refugee flight .
Two Marine planes left the airport in the Tunisian island of Djerba with a total of 132 Egyptians on board , the U.S. State Department said .
Two additional Air Force C-130s are en route to Djerba and will take another group of Egyptians home .
All four U.S. planes are expected to arrive in Cairo by <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="TIME" value="2011-03-05TNI">Saturday night</TIMEX3> , U.S. officials said .
Two Italian military cargo planes landed at the Djerba airport delivering humanitarian aid .
There are at least 10 other evacuation flights scheduled for <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2011-03-05">Saturday</TIMEX3> -- six British , three Spanish and one Italian -- said Firas Kayal , a spokesman for the United Nations refugee agency .
Nine of the flights are to evacuate Egyptians and the other is for Malians .
There are a few thousand Egyptians left in Tunisia awaiting evacuation after more than 40,000 were taken home .
Kayal said there are also three ships preparing to evacuate people .
The violence in Libya has generated an exodus out of the North African nation .
Almost 200,000 people , a majority of them foreign workers , have fled Libya -- nearly 100,000 to Tunisia and a similar number to Egypt -- according to the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees .
The numbers of people entering Tunisia daily from Libya dropped to 1,800 <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011-03-03">Thursday</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2011-03-04">Friday</TIMEX3> and stood at 3,000 <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2011-03-05">Saturday</TIMEX3> .
Previously , they averaged 10,000 to 15,000 people .
Hovig Etyemezian , a field officer for the U.N. refugee agency , attributed the drop in part to fear and the manipulation of the flow of refugees by Libyan authorities .
` ` A lot of them were scared from leaving because of the fighting so they were staying in their houses , '' he said <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2011-03-05">Saturday</TIMEX3> .
` ` We fear the regime might be blocking refugees from the border . ''
A Sudanese man who crossed into Tunisia said Libyans had been confiscating phones and SIM cards of people fleeing .
He said people are afraid to make the journey because of the fighting and the cost for bus or taxi transport to the border has spiked .
However , he said , Libyans are not stopping traffic toward border .
Raoul Gernali , a Filipino engineer who had been working on a Libyan water project , said Libyan soldiers at the Tunisian border stole his laptop , money and mobile phone .
Because of complications with his group 's flight home , he and his Filipino colleagues have had to spend <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P3D">three days</TIMEX3> at the airport .
Many countries , such as India and China , put in place well - organized evacuation operations for their citizens .
But others , including Egyptians and Bangladeshis , have been left to fend for themselves .
The U.S. State Department said <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2011-03-05">Saturday</TIMEX3> it would donate $ 3 million to the International Organization for Migration -LRB- IOM -RRB- as part of a joint U.S.-IOM partnership to help get home thousands of Egyptians and other nationals from Africa , South Asia and Southeast Asia .
Kayal said more than 10,000 Bangladeshis are awaiting transport in Tunisia .
Many Bangladeshis have had to walk to the border because their money was stolen by soldiers and they could not pay for transportation costs .
One man suffered a heart attack and died , aid officials confirmed .
