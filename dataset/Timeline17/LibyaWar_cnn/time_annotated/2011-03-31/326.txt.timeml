By Fawaz A. Gerges , Special to CNN <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P2W" mod="LESS_THAN">Almost two weeks</TIMEX3> of intense bombings and the enforcement of a no - fly zone in Libya by Western - led forces have neither broken the will of Col . Moammar Gadhafi nor subdued his followers .
Instead , <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="PXW">the past couple of weeks</TIMEX3> have proved that Libya is much more divided than the world had feared .
The major challenge facing the opposition <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> will be in reaching out to tribal supporters of Gadhafi -- and skeptics and bystanders -- to allay their fears .
This kind of reconciliation will be the only means to avert a protracted , costly civil war that could allow Gadhafi to regain some degree of control .
The coalition 's airstrikes have indeed severely degraded Gadhafi 's military infrastructure and paved the way for the rebels to recapture , at least for a time , a number of coastal communities and important oil installations , including Ras Lanuf , Brega and Bin Jawad .

But loyalist forces pushed them out in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent days</TIMEX3> -LRB-
Ajdabiya and Uqayla still appear to be in rebel hands at the moment -RRB- .
According to Pentagon spokesman Vice Adm. Bill Gortney , any military gains made by the rebels will be tenuous because of their lack of organizational structure .
Two high - level Libyan officials , Foreign Minister Moussa Koussa and Ali Abdussalam el - Treki , did defect <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2011-W13">this week</TIMEX3> .
Despite this , Gadhafi 's entourage is fiercely defending the cities and towns recaptured from the rebels .
That they continue to persevere in the face of international force should not come as a surprise , given the tribal structure of Libyan society and Gadhafi 's manipulation and co - opting of tribal divisions and allies .
What is even more alarming is that Gadhafi 's forces have managed to insert themselves into urban areas across Libya .
To defeat these loyalists will necessitate boots on the ground fighting a long , bloody , guerrilla - style war .
Civilians would undoubtedly become targets .
Even if the Western - led coalition arms and trains the rebels and dislodges Gadhafi from power , the morning after will likely be messy , costly and even less certain .
Libya appears to be sliding into a prolonged conflict with no light at the end of the tunnel .
