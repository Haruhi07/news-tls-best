By the CNN Wire Staff CIA working the ground in Libya ?
A witness said he fears a ` ` massacre '' in Misrata A U.S. presidential finding authorizes CIA operations in Libya , a source says White House : Libyan foreign minister 's defection shows pressure is ` ` having an effect ''
Tune in to ` ` AC360 '' at 10 ET <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="TIME" value="2011-03-31TNI">Thursday night</TIMEX3> for an exclusive interview with The New York Times journalists who were captured , then released by the Libyan regime .
Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- --
From the halls of Congress to the shell - pocked streets of Libyan cities , intertwined themes rang clear <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2011-03-31">Thursday</TIMEX3> :
Leader Moammar Gadhafi is determined to prevail , and the opposition needs more training and allied air strikes to have a chance .
` ` Gadhafi will ` ` kill as many -LRB- people -RRB- as he must to crush the rebellion , '' Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen told the House Armed Services Committee .
The rebels , who were regrouping after several setbacks , pinned their hopes on more coalition air power , which will likely increase as weather improves .
` ` We want more to bring a speedy end to this , '' Col . Ahmed Omar Bani , an opposition spokesman , told CNN .
` ` A strike is not a strike unless it kills , '' he said .
Rare view inside Misrata 's war zone Wounded pregnant woman shares story Gadhafi 's son had a U.S. internship Libyan foreign minister flees country CIA operatives have been in Libya working with rebel leaders to try to reverse gains by loyalist forces , a U.S. intelligence source said .
The United States , insisting it is <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> fulfilling more of a support role in the coalition , shifted in that direction as NATO took sole command of air operations in Libya .
The ferocity of <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2011-03">this month</TIMEX3> 's fighting and Gadhafi 's advantage in firepower was clearly evident in Misrata , which has seen snipers , significant casualties and destruction .
A witness told CNN <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011-03-31">Thursday</TIMEX3> there ` ` is utter madness '' and Gadhafi 's men are going door - to - door evicting and terrorizing people .
` ` I am afraid it will be one big massacre here in Misrata '' if the international forces ` ` do not do more , '' he said .
CNN did not identify the witness for security reasons .
Saddoun El - Misurati , a spokesman for the Libyan opposition in Misrata , described intense fighting and casualties in the city .
` ` We managed to get two shipments , so far , of badly needed medical supplies to the hospitals .
But obviously we still need more supplies in dealing with the day - to - day casualties and the situation on the ground , '' he said .
Gadhafi 's military capabilities had been steadily eroded since the onset of U.N.-sanctioned air strikes , U.S. officials have said .
But the dictator 's forces outnumber the rebels by about 10 - to-1 in terms of armor and other ground forces , Mullen noted .
Defense Secretary Robert Gates , also speaking before the House committee , warned that the Libyan rebels still need significant training and assistance .
` ` It 's pretty much a pickup ballgame ''
<TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3> , he said .
Anderson :
Gadhafi opposition badly armed Libyan opposition speaks out on tactics U.S. and British officials say no decision has been made about whether to arm the opposition .
Dianne Feinstein , head of the Senate Intelligence Committee , told CNN 's ` ` The Situation Room '' she opposes doing that .
The Democratic senator cited failures of such a move in other conflicts .
Bani -- asked whether he is open to the idea of ground forces from outside Libya joining the rebels ' effort -- responded that ` ` all options are open to us . ''
` ` It has been very hard <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="PXD">the past few days</TIMEX3> because the freedom forces have been facing heavy tanks and artillery weapons with very light weapons , '' the spokesman said .
While some members of the Libyan military reportedly defected to join the opposition , the rebels include many volunteers who have not been trained .
Over <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2011-W12-WE">the weekend</TIMEX3> , CNN reported that rebels had taken al - Brega , Ras Lanuf and Bin Jawad , and reached a town just east of Sirte .
But in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P3D">the past three days</TIMEX3> , opposition fighters have been pushed back eastward .
CNN 's Ben Wedeman , reporting <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2011-03-31">Thursday</TIMEX3> from near al - Brega , said the rebels , armed with light mortars and machine guns , have displayed no strategy in their running battles with loyalist troops .
Gates reiterated the Obama administration 's promise that no U.S. ground forces will be used in Libya , telling committee members that the rebels had indicated they did n't want such an intervention .

But the United States does have CIA personnel on the ground .
A U.S. intelligence source said the CIA is operating in the country to help increase U.S. ` ` military and political understanding '' of the situation .
A former counterterrorism official with knowledge of U.S. Libya policy said there is a presidential finding authorizing the CIA to conduct operations in support of U.S. policy in Libya , including assessing the opposition and determining their needs .
Specific activities by CIA officers will be determined by conditions on the ground and would need further approval from the White House , the source said .
A former senior intelligence official said officers ` ` might be advising -LRB- rebels -RRB- on how to target the adversary , how to use the weapons they have , reconnaissance and counter - surveillance . ''
Presidential findings are a type of secret order authorizing some covert intelligence operations .
The CIA has had a presence in Libya for some time , a U.S. official told CNN <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2011-03" mod="START">earlier this month</TIMEX3> .
` ` The intelligence community is aggressively pursuing information on the ground , '' the official said .
The CIA sent additional personnel to Libya to augment officers on the ground after the anti - government protests erupted , the official said , without giving details .
CIA officers assisted with the rescue of one of two U.S. airmen whose fighter jet crashed in Libya on <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2011-03-21">March 21</TIMEX3> , a knowledgeable U.S. source said .
NATO emphasized <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2011-03-31">Thursday</TIMEX3> that the U.N. resolution authorizing action in Libya precludes ` ` occupation forces . ''
NATO Adm. Giampaolo Di Paola , chairman of the NATO Military Committee , indicated that the presence of foreign intelligence personnel does not violate U.N. Security Council <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="1973">1973</TIMEX3> , which authorized action in Libya .
Rebel forces have been demanding an end to Gadhafi 's <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DURATION" value="P42Y" mod="LESS_THAN">nearly 42 years</TIMEX3> of rule in Libya .
They have faced sustained attacks by a regime fighting to stay in power and portraying the opposition as terrorists backed by al Qaeda .
Rebel forces have lost Bin Jawad and the key oil town of Ras Lanuf and are backed up to the al - Brega area , Bani said <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2011-03-30">Wednesday</TIMEX3> .
Ajdabiya , which is east of al - Brega , will be prepared as a ` ` defense point '' if the withdrawal continues farther east , he said .
Amid the setbacks faced by rebels , a significant crack in Gadhafi 's armor surfaced when Libyan Foreign Minister Moussa Koussa fled to London on <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2011-03-30">Wednesday</TIMEX3> and told the government there that he has resigned , the British Foreign Office said .
Koussa -- a former head of Libyan intelligence -- was a stalwart defender of the government as <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> as <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2011-02">a month ago</TIMEX3> .
But in <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent weeks</TIMEX3> his demeanor had visibly changed .
At one <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> media briefing , he kept his head down as he read a statement and left early .
British Foreign Secretary William Hague said Koussa had not been offered any immunity .
Koussa 's defection provides evidence ` ` that Gadhafi 's regime ... is fragmented , under pressure and crumbling from within , '' said Hague , adding that Koussa is voluntarily speaking with officials in the United Kingdom .
Libyan government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim said <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="2011-03-31">Thursday</TIMEX3> that Koussa did not tell the government he planned to resign before he flew to Britain .
Ibrahim said Koussa asked for sick leave and the government gave him permission to leave the country and receive intensive medical care .
The government had another setback <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="2011-03-31">Thursday</TIMEX3> , with news that an official who was picked as Libyan ambassador to the United Nations has defected .
A relative and an opposition leader said <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="2011-03-31">Thursday</TIMEX3> that former Foreign Minister Ali Abdussalam Treki was in Cairo .
