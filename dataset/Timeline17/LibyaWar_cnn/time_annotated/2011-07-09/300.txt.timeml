I hope that it will serve to discourage any further appearances of this hollow pedant on your superb program .
Evidently he does not represent any serious opinions expressed by anyone , even the French .

He should stick to philosophy and can talk about anything and everything and one would get hurt , if he talks nonsense .
I doubt if his name would be as well remembered as Alexis de Tocqueville 's .

He is so full of himself The obsequiousness of French politicians and media to this political ` Hanger on '' beggars belief .
In fact , he is being credited here in France with having convinced Sarkozy to take on Qadhaffi in Libya ; an effort that embroiled the US .
True or not , I ' m certain he loves basking in the limelight , any limelight .
Preferably under a street gas lamp , at night .

How is that your choice of guests to explore painful realities in Africa are both Anglo ?
What is more , footage used throughout this piece are visuals of seemingly destitute , Black Africans .
This is an affront to critical journalism , and absolutely imbalanced , GPS chase producers need to do better .
Is it too much to ask producers to balance this panel out with the presence of scholars , public intellectuals and thought leaders who are indigenous Black Africans ?
Peter Godin 's book , and Nicholas Kristof 's trip with students , may lend perspective , but do these acts render either of these men ` ` authorities '' on a continent - absolutely not .
Violence , torture , corruption , crisis in leadership , poverty , and other crimes against humanity , sadly , are pervasive globally .
Bad governance is not unique , but the disproportionate attention to Black leaders and their wrong - doing is , and has become its own brand of racism .
This segment amounts to a narrative built on biased and lazy journalism .

Reply oh , Fareed , i am so very disappointed in <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="2011-W27">this week</TIMEX3> 's show .
peter godwin is the epitomy of the hypocrisy that has enveloped parts of Africa over the decades .
He rattled on about crimes against humanity in his country of Zimbabwe and about somewhat free municipal elections in South Africa without once asking why no white was ever tried for all of the crimes against humanity committed in both countries <TIMEX3 tid="t36" type="DURATION" value="PXDE" mod="MORE_THAN">over the past few decades</TIMEX3> .
Or why bringing western style democracy has been such a challenge -LRB-
i mean , really .
if you had been brutalized for decades by whites claiming to be implementing democracy , would you trust them <TIMEX3 tid="t37" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> ?
-RRB-
Zimbabwe did not get their independence from colonial brutality until when ?

And yet into <TIMEX3 tid="t38" type="DATE" value="199">the 1990s</TIMEX3> 85 % of the fertile , money producing lands were owned by 40 000 whites .
That alone is a crime against humanity .
And let 's not even talk about South Africa , who did nt come out from under brutal oppression until well into <TIMEX3 tid="t39" type="DATE" value="199">the 1990s</TIMEX3> .
And who has ever been tried in the Hague for the evils that happened there at the hands of the white minorities ?
Yet mr . godwin wants to talk about crimes against humanity .
It seems to me that he is not yet aware of what that term really means .

Reply I was very disappointed <TIMEX3 tid="t44" type="TIME" value="2011-07-09TMO">this morning</TIMEX3> to tune in and find that the subject matter for discussion was the Strauss - Kahn hotel maid scandal .
Although the issue does have some implications for international relations , the ongoing press coverage of this issue is a reflection of our nation 's love of gossip .
There are so many other global issues that would benefit from an intelligent discussion -- why choose the gossipy topic ?
I look forward to future discussions of weightier issues from the GPS folks .

Reply I appreciate the global perspective of your program .
However , I have never seen people of African\/Black descent on your program .
For example , you <TIMEX3 tid="t51" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> highlighted some <TIMEX3 tid="t52" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> issues about Africa , yet you had two caucasions speak on these issues on your program .
Surely , you could have found some intelligent people of African\/Black descent to speak on these issues .
Furthermore , people of African\/Black descent are intelligent enough people to speak on any global issue .
It is disturbing to watch your program and ` ` never '' see anyone of African\/Black descent .
I READ THAT ERITREAS

46 nations do have troops in Afghanistan but not in combat .
Most are forbidden to serve in combat roles !
After <TIMEX3 tid="t59" type="DURATION" value="P10Y">10 years</TIMEX3> of REAL combat and hundreds of casualties , including over 10 % from US friendly fire , Canada is leaving Kandahar to join them in training and policing -LRB- \

I regret seeing you stoop to the kind of deceiptful , disparaging and or ignorant reporting on Canada that we are used to seeing in other US media .
As your largest trading partner , oil supplier and fighting ally in valid wars , it 's hard not to resent such arrogant ignorance ?
Just imagine how other nations feel !
Surely , you are n't still smarting from the ass kicking that we gave your invading armies in <TIMEX3 tid="t60" type="DATE" value="1812">1812</TIMEX3> or the fact that we ' ve created a uniquely respected separate parliamentary democracy ?

We all need real help to truly understand especially the positive possibilities and futures for some or any of the countries .
I am dumb about it all .
On the other hand , thank you very much for keeping the roundtable , especially Krista Friedland , under control and engaged in civil discussion .
That 's the way it needs to be -- Fox can do shouting matches .
I appreciated Krista 's comment that at least part of the Greek situation was caused by the German and French banks .
Yes , Greece borrowed them selves into a deep hole , but someone had to lend them the money .

And no small part of the crisis <TIMEX3 tid="t66" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> is to rescue those banks -- to heck with the Greeks .
We 're at it again .

you are not educating the public that way .

where ?
-RRB-
in the 80 's , can he instead say the location he went to , it was obviously not a city but a remote village .
please be detailed about the country u went to instead of callin it ` africa ' <TIMEX3 tid="t85" type="DATE" value="2011-07-10">July 10 , 2011</TIMEX3> at <TIMEX3 tid="t87" type="TIME" value="2011-07-10T13:52">1:52 pm</TIMEX3> |
Reply I agreed with Levy that there was something very fishy about the whole episode .
But why did no one on the panel including Levy ask the obvious question : was this a setup and if so who did it , why and how ?
I have some suggestions .
DSK was going to run against Sarkozy for President of France , and was expected to win .
We have <TIMEX3 tid="t88" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> learned that Sarkozy had spies folling DSK who were watching him so closely that they were able to inform him of the incident even before DSK was even arrested .
How likely is it that they were not only ` ` watching '' him , they also set up the whole scene using this mob - commected hooker .
I 's be willing to bet on it , .

The commentators are out there .
Do what you need to invite them .
There are many well equipped Black skinned people to speak on Africa .
At least one person would have been acceptable .
This is not a racist comment and I hope the intent is understood .

Interestingly , I have nothing against Nicholas Kristof
But was he really the best you could do ?
Was this decision based on economic considerations or was there some reason that you really felt that he was the best thinker for the show ?
Was it not possible to find an African ?
In addition Kristof 's comments on certain things was borderline offensive .
Problems of disease left him with '' ` ` a bad taste about West Africa . ''
I think an African might have offered more productive and insightful commentary .
I ' m a fan of the show
and I hope that future shows can maintain a better selection standard for guests .
I teach International Communications and while I regularly pan the shallow theater of cable news I sometimes assign your show as part of my course curriculum .
So I have an investment in keeping the show at a certain level .

Since I ' m mentioning it I ' m also worried about the underlying question that seems to drive so much of the show which is ` ` what will make America great ? ''
I ' m worried about the ways that jingoistic and romantic narratives about American exceptionalism and innovation can creep into otherwise critical and serious journalism .

While I did not time them , <TIMEX3 tid="t108" type="DURATION" value="PT1H">the one hour</TIMEX3> show must have had 15 - <TIMEX3 tid="t110" type="DURATION" value="PT20M">20 minutes</TIMEX3> of commercials .

Free and fair elections does n't a nation build .
It is easy to visit Ghana for a while , and be fawned over by the ` ` natives '' , knowing that you will eventually return to your cozy quarters in the West .
Your comments will have more relevance if you lived there permanently and had to deal with the open sewers , the bad roads , the lack of amenities , and the decadent corruption , corruption so vicious that high officials vie for office to claim it thereby embedding it in institutional structures .
Such laudatory comments appear to be designed to pacify and patronize , a sentiment evidenced by the lack of representation on your show .
Ghana is a mess and the seeming relative progress vis - a - vis other countries in Africa is a sham .
With more than 30 % of GDP in foreign debt , and a pittance 10 % of GDP in revenue from offshore oil discoveries , it is only a matter of time before all the citizens and land resources are held for ransom .
If Ghana is a success , then Africa as a whole is in big trouble .

Fareed , you more than any other talking head on TV , should have enough common sense to have INDIGENOUS AFRICANS participating in a discussion of countries on the African continent !
Failing to do this undercuts your credibility .
How can you provide a viewpoint any different from the rest of the disinterested western media when it comes to Africa if you talk to a couple of white guys about a very diverse , and yes , black continent .

A representative from the African Union would have been a good , and obvious start at balancing your panel .
I mean , really !

In an American court all the details of her alleged rape would have to be revealed .
Up to <TIMEX3 tid="t126" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> the prosecution has divulged\/leaked all details of the case to the public .
Giving the details of her side of the story is only fair .
If the case is going to be played out in public then the public should hear both sets of details .
BHL 's point that it was humiliating and an invasion of her privacy only helps to perpetuate a one - sided view of the case .
Revelations about past lies in her life may put her credibility on the line , but she still could have been raped .

Yet DSK has himself to blame for .
However good he is professionally he is a sleazebag .
His sex drive was or will always be his stumbling block .

Although I agree with her that the distinction is very important especially to women who if they are victims should not be less credible if they have an active sex life .
However , as an American living in France reading the press on both sides of the Atlantic , I would like to point out that Mr. Strauss - Kahn reputation went far beyond that of being a playboy .

To the point that female journalist were warned not to interview him alone .
As Ms. Freeland wishes to defend women who are victim of sexual aggression , she should recognize that many women are either afraid to object or to report incidents especially when the agressor is a powerful person .
If DSK has a history of sexual harassment it is relevant to this case .
And it is my impression from what I have read and watched in France since his arrest that there were numerous incidents that were ` ` winked '' at in France that would have had consequences for a man in his position in the US .
So as to Ms Freeland 's hope that this attitude not be exported to France , if so - called ` ` affairs '' are cases of sexual harassment , I fervently hope that this incident HAS led to the exportation to France of the attitude that men who use their power to abuse women should be exposed not excused .

Something to think about ...
Just as a man 's history as a skirt - chaser does n't mean he 's a rapist , a woman 's history of shady dealings does n't mean that she ca n't be a victim of a sexual assault .
The public should n't be quick to convict DSK nor should we be quick to exonerate him .
