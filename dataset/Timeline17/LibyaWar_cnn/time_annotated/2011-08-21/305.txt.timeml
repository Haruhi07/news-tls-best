CARL AZUZ , CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR :
Hey , and thank you for joining us !
I ' m Carl Azuz , launching you into CNN Student News !
If you were with us <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2011-W32">last week</TIMEX3> , it 's great to have you back .
If this is your first day , welcome to our <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3> - <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2012">2012</TIMEX3> coverage .
First Up : Crisis in Libya AZUZ :
First up <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011-08-21">today</TIMEX3> , two very different views on how the civil war is going in the north African nation of Libya .
This conflict started months ago .
Longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi and his forces are fighting against rebels who want Gadhafi out .
Other countries are involved in this , too , as part of a NATO mission to protect Libya 's civilians .
There were reports that hundreds of people were killed <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2011-08-20">yesterday</TIMEX3> during fighting in and around the Libyan capital , Tripoli .
The rebels say they 're making significant progress , advancing toward Gadhafi 's headquarters .

But the Libyan government says the rebels are losing every battle .
Colonel Gadhafi went on the radio <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2011-08-21">Sunday</TIMEX3> , urging his supporters to continue their fight .
A CNN crew that 's been in Libya for weeks said <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2011-W33-WE">this weekend</TIMEX3> 's fighting in Tripoli seemed to be the most intense fighting yet in the capital city .
AZUZ :
Violence increasing in another conflict , meanwhile , this one in the Middle East .
It started with a series of attacks on Israeli civilians and soldiers on <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2011-08-18">Thursday</TIMEX3> , and it 's turned into days of fighting between Israelis and Palestinians .
These two groups have clashed for decades .
And two regions -- Gaza and the West Bank -- have traditionally been at the center of those clashes .
At least eight Israelis were killed in the attacks on <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2011-08-18">Thursday</TIMEX3> .
Israel then launched air strikes against what it called ` ` terrorist targets '' in Gaza .
And in response , say Israeli officials , around 100 rockets have been fired into Israel .
You can see some of the damage from those in this video .
Israel 's government says it will respond to any attempt to harm Israeli civilians or soldiers .
Palestinian officials are urging Israel to stop what it calls the ` ` unjustified aggression '' against the Palestinians in Gaza .
STAN CASE , CNN STUDENT NEWS : Is this legit ?
Storms in the Atlantic Ocean are given names when they become hurricanes .
They get names when they are classified as tropical storms , which is one level below a hurricane .
AZUZ :
The 9th storm to get a name might be the first hurricane of the <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3> Atlantic season .
Forecasters predict that Tropical Storm Irene is picking up strength as it moves toward islands in the Caribbean Sea .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="TIME" value="2011-08-21TAF">Sunday afternoon</TIMEX3> , Irene had wind speeds around 50 miles per hour .
Wo n't be considered a hurricane until those wind speeds reach 74 miles per hour .
Experts think that could happen very soon .
Officials announced hurricane warnings for Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2011-08-20">yesterday</TIMEX3> .
Some predictions estimated that Irene could dump up to 20 inches of rain on parts of the Dominican Republic .
There 's concern that heavy rain could trigger mudslides there ; that has happened before .
AZUZ :
Vice President Joe Biden has finished a trip to China .
But this was the scene when he arrived in the country <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2011-08-17">last Wednesday</TIMEX3> .
He was there for <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="P5D">five days</TIMEX3> meeting with Chinese leaders , and the biggest issue discussed during his visit was the U.S. economy .
China has bought more U.S. debt that any other foreign country .
So , officials there are concerned about America 's ability to manage that debt .
During one speech , Vice President Biden explained why it 's important for the U.S. to protect Chinese and American investors .
U.S. VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN : I read that some Chinese are concerned about your safety of your investments in American assets .
But please understand no one cares more about this than we do , since Americans own 87 % of all our financial assets and 69 % of all our treasury bonds , while China owns 1 % of our financial assets and 8 % of our treasury bills , respectively .
AZUZ : All right , shifting gears <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> .
About 1.6 billion people -- just over a fifth of the world 's population -- are Muslim .
And we 're in the middle of the most sacred time on the Muslim calendar .
It 's called Ramadan , and it lasts for an entire month .
Although there are disagreements about when exactly that month starts .
Dan Gilgoff explains that -- and more -- about this observance .
DAN GILGOFF , CNN.COM RELIGION EDITOR :
Ramadan is the Islamic month of fasting .
It 's meant to be <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DURATION" value="P1M">a month</TIMEX3> of reflection , prayer and charity , detachment from worldly affairs .
<TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DURATION" value="P1M">A month</TIMEX3> of purification .
It 's one of the 5 pillars , or duties , of Islam .
Ramadan is believed to be the month during which the prophet Mohammed started receiving the divine revelation , the Quran , or the Muslim holy book , from God , or Allah .
And so , the most holy night during Ramadan -- and of the entire Islamic year -- is called the night of power , and that 's the night which it is believed that Allah did start to reveal the text of the Quran to the prophet Mohammed in the year 610 .
Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar .
And the Islamic calendar operates according to the lunar cycle , the cycle of the moon .

And so <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="SET" value="P1Y" quant="EVERY">every year</TIMEX3> , Ramadan moves up <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2011-08-06" mod="APPROX">around 11 days earlier</TIMEX3> than <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2010">the previous year</TIMEX3> .
It 's supposed to begin with the sighting of the first new moon of that cycle .

And <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="SET" value="P1Y" quant="EVERY">every year</TIMEX3> , there are debates about when that first new moon becomes visible , so that various countries believe that they see the first new moon on various days and Ramadan will begin on different days in different countries .
The fast is broken each night with what 's called the iftar meal , and it 's a meal that 's often times communal or banquet - style meal that 's eaten in a mosque .
The fast each night is often broken with dates , which is believed to have dated to the time of Mohammed .
<TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="SET" value="P1Y" quant="EVERY">Every year</TIMEX3> during Ramadan the international sale of dates just skyrockets .
The month of Ramadan ends with the holiday called Eid ul - Fitr .
It 's often simply just referred to as Eid .
It is the start of the next lunar month after Ramadan .
It 's a break the fast holiday that 's marked by a lot of celebrations and feasting with friends and families .
A lot of mosques hold carnivals for <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DURATION" value="PXD">a couple of days</TIMEX3> after Ramadan ends .

<TIMEX3 tid="t36" type="DATE" value="2011-W32">Last week</TIMEX3> , he was the one getting the special greetings from all of them .
