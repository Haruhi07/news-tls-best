` ` The AU high - level ad hoc committee welcomes Colonel Gadhafi 's acceptance of not being part of the negotiation process , '' the statement said .
It was unclear who would represent the Libyan government in negotiations , or when negotiations would occur .
Journalists were not allowed to ask questions at a news conference after <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2011-06-26">Sunday</TIMEX3> 's meeting of the African Union 's special committee on Libya in Pretoria , South Africa .
Members of the committee have met with Gadhafi and opposition leaders <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P3M" mod="MORE_THAN">over the past three months</TIMEX3> .
Another African Union - led attempt to broker peace between Gadhafi and the rebels fell through in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2011-04">April</TIMEX3> .
African Union holds Libya peace talks Waiting game on Libyan front House rejects restricting Libya funding Protesting for , against Gadhafi in Libya South African President Jacob Zuma told the committee <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2011-06-26">Sunday</TIMEX3> that continued bombing by NATO and its allies was a ` ` concern , '' since protecting the Libyan people was the intention behind a U.N. resolution authorizing the use of force in the North African nation .
` ` The intention was not to authorize a campaign for regime change or political assassination , '' he said .
The committee repeated calls <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2011-06-26">Sunday</TIMEX3> for a cease - fire between the Libyan government and rebels .
` ` Only a political solution will make it possible to sustainably settle the <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> conflict , '' the statement said .
It also urged the temporary ` ` stopping of NATO bombings '' to allow delivery of humanitarian aid .
` ` Civilian lives have been lost due to these bombings , and civilian infrastructure has suffered untold damage , '' Zuma said .
Ahead of <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2011-06-26">Sunday</TIMEX3> 's meeting , human rights activists urged the African Union to prioritize the issue of the plight of civilians caught in armed conflicts , including Libya .
The meeting followed claims <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2011-06-25">a day earlier</TIMEX3> by the Libyan government that NATO warplanes bombed a bakery and a restaurant in a key oil refinery town east of Tripoli , a charge the alliance has countered .
Gadhafi has been a strong supporter of the African Union and has channeled large sums of money its way .
Libya also holds a seat on the 15 - member Peace and Security Council , which is headed by Lamamra .
The African Union 's committee on Libya includes representatives from Mauritania , the Democratic Republic of Congo , Mali , Uganda and South Africa .
Opposition leaders had voiced doubt that any mediation involving that multinational group would end the conflict in a way that would satisfy their goals , which include Gadhafi 's ouster .
In its proposed agreement in <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2011-04">April</TIMEX3> , the African Union said Gadhafi had agreed in principle to stop all hostilities and allow outside forces to help keep the peace .
But rebels rejected the non - binding proposal , saying it did not address whether Gadhafi would step down or provide any solution to the violence against the Libyan people .
Both Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have blamed the Gadhafi regime for violations of human rights , including indiscriminate fire on civilians , the use of internationally banned cluster bombs and the torture and executions of captured fighters .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2011-06-26">Sunday</TIMEX3> , an International Committee of the Red Cross ship arrived in Tripoli from the rebel stronghold of Benghazi with about 100 people on board .
It was the second time in <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="P1W">a week</TIMEX3> that the ICRC has reunited friends and families between the the eastern opposition - controlled city and the western regime - controlled city .
NATO began bombing military targets in <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2011-03">March</TIMEX3> after the U.N. Security Council issued a resolution authorizing force by whatever means necessary , with the exception of a ground invasion , to protect civilians .
Libya accused NATO on <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2011-06-25">Saturday</TIMEX3> of killing civilians in airstrikes , with NATO responding that it struck key command - and - control centers .
The alliance said there was ` ` no indication of civilian casualties in connection with these strikes . ''
Gadhafi 's forces have occupied buildings in an abandoned area of al - Brega from where they are launching attacks on civilians , a NATO statement said .
The alliance monitored the buildings and said it determined they were clear military targets .
` ` This continues to show Gadhafi 's reprehensible tactics of placing military assets and operations at the heart of civilian neighborhoods , '' said Lt . Gen. Charles Bouchard , NATO commander for the Libya campaign .
` ` We have meticulously monitored these developments for a significant period and it was time to remove this threat , '' he said .
Al - Brega is a key oil refinery town about 500 miles east of Tripoli that has been the scene of heavy fighting between pro - Gadhafi forces and rebel fighters .
Abdul Hafiz Ghoga , a spokesman and deputy chairman of the opposition 's Transitional National Council , said Gadhafi bears a lot of the responsibility for civilian casualties as the Libyan leader keeps weapons near where people live .
Also <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2011-06-25">Saturday</TIMEX3> , Libyan state TV said NATO strikes hit Gharyan , a city in the west .
The report cited an unnamed military source who said a number of people were killed and wounded in the attack .
CNN can not independently confirm the claim .
CNN 's Nkepile Mabuse , Raja Razek , Yousuf Basil and Ingrid Formanek and journalist David Adams contributed to this report .
