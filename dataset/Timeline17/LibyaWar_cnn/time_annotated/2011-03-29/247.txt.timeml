CNN -RRB- -- Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi 's youngest son , who runs the country 's elite special forces for his father 's regime , was on an internship program in the United States when public unrest exploded in Libya <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2011-02">last month</TIMEX3> .
Khamis Gadhafi abruptly cut off his visit and returned to Libya , where he has led the 32nd Reinforced Brigade , known at the Khamis Brigade , in its brutal suppression of rebel forces .
The brigade 's headquarters was the target of six Tomahawk missiles overnight , according to Vice Adm. William Gortney of the Joint Chiefs of Staff .
Gortney described the brigade as ` ` one of the most active in terms of attacking innocent people . ''

Prior to the broadcast there had been unconfirmed reports that the younger Gadhafi had died from injuries he suffered when a plane flown by a disgruntled Libyan pilot crashed into a military compound while he was there .
ABC News was the first to report Khamis Gadhafi 's <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> stay in the United States .
Gadhafi opposition runs into resistance AECOM has business dealings with Libya .
The younger Gadhafi traveled from coast to coast meeting with high - tech companies , universities and defense contractors .
His itinerary included stops in San Francisco , Los Angeles , Colorado , Chicago , Houston , Washington and New York City .
Khamis Gadhafi left the United States for Libya on <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2011-02-17">February 17</TIMEX3> .
Paul Gennaro , the senior vice president and chief communications officer for AECOM , issued a statement saying , ` ` The educational internship , which consisted of publicly available information , was aligned with our efforts to improve quality of life , specifically in Libya , where we were advancing public infrastructure such as access to clean water ; quality housing ; safe and efficient roads and bridges ; reliable and affordable energy ; and related projects that create jobs and opportunity . ''
Gennaro said the company was ` ` shocked and outraged '' to learn of Khamis Gadhafi 's role in the Libyan crisis .
` ` We were aware of the student 's family relationship , but we were not informed of any military connection whatsoever , '' Gennaro said .
It was the company 's understanding that Khamis Gadhafi was an MBA student from an accredited university in Spain .
` ` The student was positioned to help oversee improvements in Libya 's quality of life and infrastructure initiatives , which the country had been advancing since <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2007">2007</TIMEX3> , '' he said .
The U.S. State Department was aware of and approved all the meetings , Gennaro said .
According to Gennaro , AECOM did not provide any funding for either Khamis Gadhafi or the internship program .
Since <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> , AECOM has been involved in a multibillion - dollar initiative with Libya to modernize the country 's infrastructure .
