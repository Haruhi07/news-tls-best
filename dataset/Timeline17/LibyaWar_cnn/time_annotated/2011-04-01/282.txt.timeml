From Frederik Pleitgen and Jonathan Wald , CNN Buildings are riddled with bullet holes ; wreckage litters the streets Moammar Gadhafi 's forces laid siege to the western city A CNN team gets a firsthand look Misrata , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DURATION" value="P5W">Five weeks</TIMEX3> of battle and Misrata looks grim .
Bullets have made Swiss cheese of buildings .
Wreckage litters streets that are empty save opposition fighters desperately defending their city against Moammar Gadhafi 's heavy armor .
The Libyan leader laid siege to the nation 's third largest and most prosperous city after opposition fighters took control here .
Just <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="PT2H">two hours</TIMEX3> east of Tripoli , it was the final rebel stronghold in the West .
<TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> it is a city of fear , uncertainty and human suffering .
International reporters had not been able to access central Misrata and many of CNN 's reports were cobbled together from interviews with witnesses and doctors .
That was until <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-03-30">Wednesday</TIMEX3> , when CNN journalists were able to reach the city by boat .

The fishing trawler was commissioned by two wealthy Libyan businessmen to carry 150 tons of food , medicine and other basic supplies .
A heart surgeon on board said he wants to do everything he can to help : Libya is in ` ` mortal danger '' and he could not stand by without doing his share .
Rare view inside Misrata 's war zone CIA working the ground in Libya ?
One Misrata resident says Gadhafi 's men are going door - to - door evicting and terrorizing people .
It 's ` ` utter madness , '' he said <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2011-03-31">Thursday</TIMEX3> , fearing a massacre .
Bullets zing through the air .
Tension hangs thick and heavy .
An opposition fighter celebrates atop the carcass of a tank .
Another shows the consequences of Gadhafi 's heavy hand -- destroyed schools , restaurants , gas stations , fire stations .
Gadhafi 's foes say they are outgunned and fight back with the few weapons they possess , including rifles and rocket - propelled grenades .
They provided CNN with a video of a man disabling a tank with a rocket - propelled grenade launcher .
Despite the weapons disparity , the opposition has held onto an enclave in the city for <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="PXW">several weeks</TIMEX3> .
It 's difficult , day to day , to know where the battlefront will be .
The evidence of war mounts everywhere .
At a relocated orphanage , children , traumatized by bombs and bullets , rock back and forth chanting ` ` Allahu Akbar . ''
-LRB- God is great .
-RRB-
At a school , entire families displaced from their homes find comfort in one another .
They have nothing else left of their lives , says Masoud el - Masoudi , who came to the shelter <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2011-W12">a week ago</TIMEX3> with his wife and three children after their house on Benghazi Street was shelled .
At a makeshift refugee camp next to the port , Libya 's largest , foreign workers trapped in the nation 's war simply try to survive <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EACH">each day</TIMEX3> .
They are from places like Niger , Ivory Coast , Ghana and Egypt .
They have nothing but the bread people bring them to feed their aching bellies , says Masahudu Idris , 29 , of Ghana .
The shops are empty and there is no food they can buy , he says .
At the central hospital -- where men , women and children lie in crowded rooms , forever scarred -- doctors work around the clock without proper equipment , medicine or even anesthesia .
` ` We do n't go from here , '' says Dr. Ali el - Misrati .
` ` We sleep here .
We live here <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> . ''
The chief of the hospital , Dr. Mohammed Fortia , says 398 people have been killed in Misrata since the Libyan conflict began <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2011-03">last month</TIMEX3> .
Five were killed <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2011-03-30">Wednesday</TIMEX3> , he says .
He fears more have died .
The hospital just does n't know about them .
Mohammed , 12 , and his older brother were wounded when mortars hit their home .
Mohammed lost several fingers on his left hand .
His right hand is gone .
His father vows revenge .
` ` Gadhafi should be killed , '' he says .
A man who can do this to his people , Mohammed 's father says , must not be human .
