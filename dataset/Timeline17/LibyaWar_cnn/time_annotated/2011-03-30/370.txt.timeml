By the CNN Wire Staff Mother of alleged rape victim ` angry ' The are no longer afraid to condemn Gadhafi They say the regime is still holding al - Obeidy
An investigation continues in the case Tobruk , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Aysha Ahmed and Attique Saleh lived in silence for <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DURATION" value="P4DE" mod="MORE_THAN">more than four decades</TIMEX3> under the ironfisted rule of Moammar Gadhafi .
Not after they watched their daughter manhandled and dragged away from a Tripoli hotel .
Eman al - Obeidy 's parents told CNN <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-03-29">Tuesday</TIMEX3> they are no longer afraid to publicly condemn the Libyan strongman , an act that would have been unthinkable just weeks ago .
If Gadhafi were to face Ahmed <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> , she would slap him , she told CNN <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-03-29">Tuesday</TIMEX3> .
Al - Obeidy burst into the hotel housing international journalists in Tripoli <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2011-03-26">Saturday</TIMEX3> and told them she had been raped by 15 militia men .
Cameras captured the drama as al - Obeidy , sobbing and screaming , wanted the world to know the brutality of Gadhafi 's regime .
Woman alleges rape by Gadhafi forces Marriage for woman allegedly raped The Libyan government said al - Obeidy has been freed and that a criminal case is underway .
The men accused of raping al - Obeidy have filed counter - charges for slander , Libyan government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim said <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011-03-29">Tuesday</TIMEX3> .

But Ahmed contradicted the government , saying the government was still detaining her daughter , in an interview in the eastern city of Tobruk .
She said she wanted Gadhafi to air footage of al - Obeidy as proof of her safety .
Ahmed said she can not forgive the grave injustice her daughter has suffered .
She said the family has even received phone calls offering bribes to reject their daughter 's claims and to tell their daughter to change her story .
But they stand by her .
They believe that Gadhafi 's regime is trying to discredit her as a woman who has been raped and -- as some people in conservative Muslim societies believe -- therefore dishonored .
An in - absentia engagement ceremony held at a mosque in Tobruk <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="TIME" value="2011-03-28TNI">Monday night</TIMEX3> proves that al - Obeidy 's family and tribe stand by her , Ahmed said .
She described her daughter , 29 , as a kind , caring woman who wanted to be a journalist .
She chose to study law instead when she realized there was no freedom of the press in her homeland .
The government first portrayed al - Obeidy as mentally ill and a prostitute .
It has since changed its story , saying she is sane and therefore able to withstand legal proceedings .
She also harbored a deep love of languages , particularly Italian and French , Ahmed said .
As a young girl , she looked out over the deep blue waters of the Mediterranean and called on the oil tankers to carry her to France .
A government spokesman said <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2011-03-27">Sunday</TIMEX3> that al - Obeidy had been released and was with her family .
Moussa Ibrahim said then that al - Obeidy and her family were asked if they wanted to be interviewed by ` ` one or two , preferably female , reporters to verify that she 's fine , she 's healthy , she 's free with her family . ''
He refused to take further questions on the issue , repeatedly stating that Libyan society is ` ` very conservative . ''
A group of lawyers and human rights activists tried to approach al - Obeidy 's sister 's house <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2011-03-28">Monday</TIMEX3> , but were blocked by security forces .
The sister 's mobile phone has apparently been turned off , a source with the opposition in Tripoli told CNN , and no one has seen her since the incident at the hotel .
Ahmed said she was also concerned for the safety of her other daughter .
Al - Obeidy stormed into the Rixos Hotel as international journalists were having breakfast <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="TIME" value="2011-03-26TMO">Saturday morning</TIMEX3> .
Her face was bruised .
So were her legs .
She showed reporters blood on her right inner thigh .
Speaking in English , she said had been held against her will for <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="P2D">two days</TIMEX3> and raped by 15 men .
Though her injuries appeared consistent with what she said , CNN could not independently verify al - Obeidy 's story .
` ` Look at what Gadhafi 's brigades did to me , '' she said .
` ` My honor was violated by them . ''
Al - Obeidy displayed what appeared to be visible rope burns on her wrists and ankles .
Government officials tried to stifle her , but she persisted .
Security forces moved to subdue her , and even a member of the hotel 's kitchen staff drew a knife .
Another staffer tried to throw a dark tablecloth over her head .
One government official , who was there to facilitate access for journalists , pulled a pistol from his belt .
Others scuffled with reporters and wrestled them to the ground in an attempt to take away their equipment .
Some journalists were beaten and kicked .
CNN 's camera was confiscated and deliberately smashed beyond repair .
As security forces subdued the screaming woman and dragged her away , al - Obeidy warned , ` ` If you do n't see me <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2011-03-31">tomorrow</TIMEX3> , then that 's it . ''
