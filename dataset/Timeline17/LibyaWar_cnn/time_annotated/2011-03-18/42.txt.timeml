-RRB- President Obama is trying to limit the United States ' role in enforcing a no - fly zone over Libya to support aircraft only and is very reluctant to commit any offensive U.S. firepower , a senior U.S. official familiar with the military planning discussions said <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2011-03-18">Friday</TIMEX3> .

But we are part of it and expect a lot from our partners , '' the official said .

The Libyan government has decided on an immediate cease - fire in its civil war with rebels , Libyan Foreign Minister Moussa Koussa said <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2011-03-18">Friday</TIMEX3> .
Libya 's action comes after the U.N. Security Council authorized the use of force to protect Libyan civilians from attacks by forces loyal to the Moammar Gadhafi regime .
Enforcement of a no - fly zone over Libya could begin in hours , a French government spokesman said on <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="2011-03-18">Friday</TIMEX3> .
This reminds me of <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="1919">1919</TIMEX3> when the League of Nations assigned France to mandate Lebanon in order to ` create a better future ' for the countries that were extricated from the Ottoman Empire .
However , the secret Sykes - Picot Agreement and Balfour Declaration proved the typical colonization goals and not the alleged aiding goals .
Similarly , the French ` assistance ' to the Libyans will turn be the mask of secret colonization treaties .

Very true , George F. Look at the idiotic way the French handled the French - Indochina War .
They should have gotten together with the Viet Minh and created a French Commonwealth where Vietnam would become a part of it .
