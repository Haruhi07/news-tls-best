CNN -RRB- --
The town of Derna is not much to look at -- a heap of Soviet - style concrete buildings in a deprived and windswept corner of eastern Libya .
But it has a rich history -- fought over and colonized since Roman times -- and a stunning location on the Mediterranean .
It has also gained a reputation as a hotbed of jihadists .
And that has diplomats and analysts asking whether the unrest in Libya might provide an opening for al Qaeda and fellow travelers , just a short hop from Europe .
Derna even made it into U.S. diplomatic cables obtained by Wikileaks .
A cable from <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> describes it as a ` ` wellspring of Libyan foreign fighters '' for al Qaeda in Iraq .
High youth unemployment , discrimination by the Gadhafi regime and the influence of veteran Libyan jihadists from Afghanistan all played a role in radicalizing a new generation .
` ` Other factors include a dearth of social outlets for young people , -LRB- and -RRB- local pride in Derna 's history as a locus of fierce opposition to occupation , '' the cable said .
` ` Most young men watched a mix of al - Jazeera news , religious sermons and western action films on English language satellite channels broadcast from the Gulf .
The result was a heady mixture of violence , religious conservatism and hatred of U.S. policy in Iraq and Palestine . ''
President Obama 's plan on Libya Obama on Libya : We have saved lives Gadhafi : ` We will be victorious ' <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011-03-23">Today</TIMEX3> , Derna is very much in the opposition 's hands , and accounts from eastern Libya say Islamists and others are fighting side - by - side with one aim : removing Moammar Gadhafi .
But what comes next ?
Gadhafi has been quick to raise the specter of al Qaeda as the beneficiary of unrest in Libya , even claiming that it was drugging young Libyans into opposing his rule .
The regime has also paraded a former member of the Libyan Islamist Fighting Group who had allegedly been ` ` captured '' during fighting in Zawiyah .

While the regime 's claims may seem outlandish , a former leader of Libyan jihadists tells CNN that al Qaeda will seek to take advantage of chaos in Libya .
` ` If there is a power vacuum in Libya there will be an open market for al Qaeda , '' says Noman Benotman , a former commander in the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group and one - time ally of Osama bin Laden .
The LIFG fought the Gadhafi regime in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="199">the 1990s</TIMEX3> , but formally ended its campaign to overthrow the Libyan regime <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2009">two years ago</TIMEX3> , and repudiated al Qaeda .
Benotman is <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> a senior researcher at the Quilliam Foundation in London , a counter - terrorism think tank .
Having played no role in the rebellion so far , al Qaeda and its affiliates will have to play catch - up if they do want to exploit the situation , says Benotman .
Individuals who might have jihadist sympathies are keeping them under wraps for the sake of uniting with one aim : removing Gadhafi , he says .
Added to which there has been a broad welcome among Libyan rebels of all stripes for U.S. and coalition airstrikes to protect the city of Benghazi .
According to Benotman , dozens of former LIFG fighters have <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> joined rebel efforts to topple Gadhafi , but he stressed that they had done so in a personal capacity rather than organizing operations as a group .
Protest movements across the Middle East -- predominantly secular and pro - democracy -- have so far reduced the jihadist message to irrelevance .
But Benotman sees potentially dangerous parallels in Libya with neighboring Algeria and with Afghanistan .
After the Soviet withdrawal in <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="1989">1989</TIMEX3> , the West walked away from Afghanistan rather than use its ` ` soft power '' to bring about positive change , he says .
The Taliban eventually filled the void .
As a young jihadist , Benotman was there to witness it .
Fighter jet crash : What happened Preparing for battle in Libya And in Algeria , a <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="1992">1992</TIMEX3> army coup following electoral gains by radical Islamist parties spawned a violent insurgency .
More than 100,000 Algerians were killed in a savage conflict between the state and Islamist extremists before the insurgency waned in <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="199" mod="MID">the mid-1990s</TIMEX3> .
Some Western counter - terrorism officials fret that a prolonged civil war in Libya could open up space for al Qaeda .
Governments and NGOs have to be quick , says Benotman , in helping rebel - held areas develop education , health - care and the institutions of democracy .
Libya -- like Yemen -- has a less developed ` ` civil society '' than either Egypt or Tunisia after <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DURATION" value="P40Y">40 years</TIMEX3> of authoritarian rule .
It also has entrenched tribal rivalries and a small middle class .
Such conditions were compounded by Gadhafi 's strategy of divide and rule through a baffling array of competing power centers .
Al Qaeda has already scented an opportunity .
Its leading ideologue , Abu Yahya al - Libi -- himself a Libyan -- told Islamists in the country : ` ` Store your weapons and do not relinquish them . ''
In an audio tape released on <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2011-03-12">March 12</TIMEX3> , he said that ` ` ousting these regimes is not the end in making a change . ''
<TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DURATION" value="P1W">A week</TIMEX3> later the leader of al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb -LRB-
AQIM -RRB- had a similar message .
In an audiotape posted on Jihadist websites and translated by the SITE Intelligence Group , Abu Musab Wadud told Gadhafi 's opponents : ` ` We will be side - by - side with you , Allah willing . ''
Until <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> , That may be wishful thinking .
AQIM has in <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> times been restricted to remote parts of Mali , Niger and Mauritania and has suffered leadership splits .
Wadud may also have damaged his cause by predicting the United States and NATO would never help the rebels because they were the ` ` source of the disaster . ''
But al Qaeda is nothing if not persistent .

And there is a long history of Islamist radicalization in Libya , especially in the impoverished , restive eastern provinces .
At the peak of the Iraqi insurgency , more jihadists per capita traveled to join al Qaeda in Iraq from Libya than from any other country .
And according to al Qaeda records seized by the U.S. Army in Iraq , in <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="2006">2006</TIMEX3> - <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="2007">07</TIMEX3> more volunteers -- a total of 53 -- traveled to Iraq from Derna than any other city in the Arab world .
And in <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DATE" value="199">the 1990s</TIMEX3> , Benotman 's group had tried to establish a safe haven in Derna , eventually being bombed into submission by the Libyan air force .
Which brings us back to the U.S. cable from <TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> , in which an American diplomat who traveled to Derna , quoted a local businessman who had ` ` likened young men in Derna to Bruce Willis ' character in the action picture ` Die Hard , ' who stubbornly refused to die quietly .
For them , resistance against coalition forces in Iraq is an important act of ` jihad ' and a last act of defiance against the Gadhafi regime . ''
` ` It 's jihad -- it 's our duty , and you 're talking about people who do n't have much else to be proud of , '' he said .
Maybe that at last is changing .
