By the CNN Wire Staff President gives an exclusive interview to CNN 's Spanish - language network Gadhafi could ` ` hunker down '' in the face of a no - fly zone , Obama concedes The president cites the humanitarian goals of the military mission San Salvador , El Salvador -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Barack Obama on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2011-03-22">Tuesday</TIMEX3> expressed hope that Libya 's opposition movement , given new protection by a U.S.-led military mission , can organize itself to revive broad enthusiasm for political change and oust Moammar Gadhafi from power .
In a 13 - minute interview with CNN 's Spanish - language network , Obama said the immediate goal of the U.N.-sanctioned military mission that began <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-03-19">Saturday</TIMEX3> was to prevent an onslaught of the rebel stronghold of Benghazi by Gadhafi 's military .
` ` Because the international community rallied , his troops have <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> pulled back from Benghazi , '' Obama said .
<TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> the United States and its coalition partners , including NATO allies and Arab states , are establishing a no - fly zone over Libya , with U.S. forces taking out Gadhafi 's air defense systems , Obama said .
He conceded that Gadhafi could ` ` hunker down and wait it out even in the face of a no - fly zone , even though his forces have been degraded . ''
Obama hopes Libyan rebels will organize Obama on Libya : We have saved lives Gadhafi ` not backing down one - inch ' Critics : U.S. ca n't afford Libya mission ` ` Our hope is that the first thing that happens once we clear this space is that the rebels start discussing how they 're able to organize themselves , how they articulate their aspirations for the Libyan people , '' Obama said .
` ` Potentially what we may see is all the enthusiasm that the Libyan people had for a change in government that was occurring <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">a few weeks ago</TIMEX3> , '' but was brutally repressed by Gadhafi , can <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> resurface , the president said .
In particular , Obama said he hoped that the Libyan people decide it was time for a change that ends up sweeping Gadhafi from power .
The president acknowledged the irony of being a Nobel Peace Prize winner who ordered the U.S. military into action on the eight anniversary of the <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2003">2003</TIMEX3> U.S.-led invasion of Iraq , but said the goal in this case was humanitarian .
` ` I ' m accustomed to this contradiction of being both a commander - in - chief but also somebody who aspires to peace , '' Obama said , adding the Libya mission was to protect the Libyan people from Gadhafi 's military .
` ` We 're not invading a country ; we are not acting alone , '' he said .
` ` We are acting under a mandate issued by the U.N. Security Council . ''
The American people will see no contradiction between someone who believes in peace and ` ` who wants to make sure people are n't butchered because of a dictator who wants to cling to power , ` ` Obama added .
Speaking in El Salvador on the final leg of a three - nation Latin American trip that included stops in Brazil and Chile , Obama also cited what he called a new relationship between the United States and the region to the south .
He noted that an area once known for dictatorships and coups <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> featured democratic governments that were less focused on political ideology and more focused on results in helping their people .
` ` That 's the kind of partner we want , '' Obama said , describing the relationship as a ` ` two - way street '' based on mutual respect , interests and trust , rather than the old model of underdeveloped nations approaching the United States with ` ` hat in hand . ''
Asked about immigration reform back home , Obama said he would again make the push for a comprehensive bill .
` ` I ' m going to need some help , '' he said .
` ` I can get the majority of Democrats to support it .
I need some help from Republicans . ''
With <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2010">last year</TIMEX3> 's census results showing a growing Hispanic population in the United States , Obama said Republicans will have a hard time winning future elections if they focus on anti - immigration sentiment .
