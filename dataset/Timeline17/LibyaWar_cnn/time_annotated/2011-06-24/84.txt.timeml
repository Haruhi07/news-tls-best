By the CNN Wire Staff Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has said the NATO mission in Libya should not be abandoned , speaking during a trip to Jamaica .
` ` To deny them funding would be a mistake , '' Gates says ` ` The government gets shakier by the day , '' he say ` ` The president has failed to make his case , '' Boehner says Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- --
Outgoing Defense Secretary Robert Gates said <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2011-06-23">Thursday</TIMEX3> it would be a mistake for Congress to cut funding for U.S. military operations in Libya .
` ` I think , once we have our forces engaged , to deny them funding would be a mistake , '' Gates told PBS News .
U.S. allies -- particularly the British , the French and the Italians -- consider Libya a vital interest , and ` ` our alliance with them is a vital interest for us , '' he said , citing their efforts in Afghanistan .
Progress has been made toward the U.S. goal of ousting Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi from power , Gates said .
` ` Based on everything we see , the government gets shakier by the day .
His forces have been significantly diminished .
The opposition is expanding the areas under their control . ''
But , he acknowledged , ` ` I do n't think anybody can predict when he will and\/or leave . ''
But the bottom line is , whose side are you on ?
Are you on Gadhafi 's side or are you on the side of the aspirations of the Libyan people and the international coalition that has been created to support them ?
-- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton .
Protesting for , against Gadhafi in Libya Gates was appointed to the job 4 - 1\/<TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2009">2 years ago</TIMEX3> by President George W. Bush , and continued to serve in the role under President Barack Obama .
He is slated to retire <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011-06-30">June 30</TIMEX3> .
But Congress has expressed impatience with the pace of the NATO military effort , which got under way <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2011-03">three months ago</TIMEX3> to protect peaceful anti - government demonstrators in Libya .
Republicans have accused Obama of having violated the War Powers Act by not having sought congressional authorization for the military intervention within <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P60D">60 days</TIMEX3> -- a deadline that has passed .
Obama said <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2011-W24">last week</TIMEX3> that he did not believe he needed the approval because the U.S. military role is limited .

But that did n't placate some House Republicans .
` ` I believe -- and I think most of my colleagues believe -- that the president has failed to make his case as to why we have engaged in Libya , '' House Speaker John Boehner told reporters <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2011-06-23">Thursday</TIMEX3> .
` ` I think the strategy was flawed from the beginning .
As I said then , I understand the humanitarian mission , but the idea that the rest of the strategy was to hope that Gadhafi would leave begged the question of well how long are we going to be there ? ''
But , the Ohio Republican added , ` ` I do n't want to do anything that would undermine NATO or to send the signal to our allies around the world that we are not going to be engaged .
This is primarily a fight between the Congress and the president over his unwillingness to consult with us before making this decision . ''
During a trip to Jamaica on <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2011-06-22">Wednesday</TIMEX3> , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton dismissed fears of a quagmire and said the mission should not be abandoned <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> .
Clinton said the Libyan opposition has made ` ` very clear progress '' in its political organization , as well as in its fight against forces loyal to Gadhafi .
` ` But the bottom line is , whose side are you on ? ''
she said to reporters .
` ` Are you on Gadhafi 's side or are you on the side of the aspirations of the Libyan people and the international coalition that has been created to support them ? ''
` ` For the Obama administration , the answer to that question is very easy . ''
Boehner said <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2011-06-22">Wednesday</TIMEX3> that the GOP - controlled House will not back a resolution sponsored by Sen. John McCain , R - Arizona , expressing congressional support for limited American involvement in the NATO - led military campaign in Libya .
McCain 's resolution , introduced <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2011-06-21">Tuesday</TIMEX3> with Sen. John Kerry , D - Massachusetts , authorizes the commitment of U.S. forces for <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> , while stressing the lack of support for any use of American ground troops .
McCain , the GOP 's <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> presidential nominee and a decorated veteran of the Vietnam War , said he believes Obama ` ` did the right thing by intervening -LRB- in Libya -RRB- to stop a looming humanitarian disaster . ''
House leaders are preparing to hold a vote on the McCain - Kerry measure , but are also considering another resolution that would strictly limit U.S. involvement in Libya to a noncombat role .
Clinton testified <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2011-06-23">Thursday</TIMEX3> on the matter in private session before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee .
