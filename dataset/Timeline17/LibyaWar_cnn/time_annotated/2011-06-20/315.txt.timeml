The Libyan government alleges 15 people , including three children , died Fighting is ongoing near Dafniya , west of Misrata Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- --
NATO said <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2011-06-20">Monday</TIMEX3> that a residential building west of Tripoli was targeted <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2011-06-20" mod="START">early Monday</TIMEX3> in an airstrike that the Libyan government alleges killed 15 people , including three children .
NATO said in a statement that , while it could not confirm the casualties , ` ` we would regret any loss of civilian life and we go to great lengths to avoid civilian casualties . ''
The organization added that the strike was justified .
` ` This was a precision strike on a legitimate military target -- a command - and - control node which was directly involved in coordinating systematic attacks on the Libyan people , '' NATO said in the statement .
` ` The facility which was struck was identified as a command - and - control node through rigorous analysis based on persistent intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance carried out over a prolonged period of time , '' it said .
` ` This strike will greatly degrade the Gadhafi regime forces ' ability to carry on their barbaric assault against the Libyan people , '' said NATO Lt.-Gen .
Charles Bouchard , referring to the Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi .
<TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-06-20">Monday</TIMEX3> 's incident occurred <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="TIME" value="2011-06-20T04:00" mod="APPROX">about 4 a.m.</TIMEX3> -LRB- <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="TIME" value="2011-06-20T22:00">10 p.m.</TIMEX3> ET <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2011-06-19">Sunday</TIMEX3> -RRB- , said Libyan government spokesman Musa Ibrahim , and included strikes from eight rockets .
Five houses and a farm were hit in the Surman area , he said .
Surman is west of Tripoli .
One of the homes belongs to Khaled el - Kweldi , a top aide to Gadhafi , Ibrahim said .
He was not home at the time of the attack , but Khaleda el - Kweldi , a 6 - year - old girl , was killed , along with Khalid el - Kweldi , a 4 - year - old boy , the spokesman said .
Another 6 - year - old , Salam Lanouri , was also killed , according to Ibrahim .
<TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2011-06-20">Monday</TIMEX3> 's strike in Surman came <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> after NATO acknowledged an errant airstrike in Tripoli may have caused ` ` a number of civilian casualties . ''
Libya 's government said <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2011-06-19">Sunday</TIMEX3> that nine people were killed and six wounded when a NATO strike hit a residential neighborhood in the Libyan capital .
NATO said <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2011-06-19">Sunday</TIMEX3> that a military missile site was the intended target .
` ` However , it appears that one weapon did not strike the intended target and that there may have been a weapons system failure , '' a NATO statement said .
Bouchard said the organization ` ` regrets the loss of innocent lives . ''
` ` This is cold - blooded murder , '' Ibrahim said at the scene of the <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2011-06-19">Sunday</TIMEX3> attack .
` ` Is this the protection of civilians ?
Is this really the search for peace and democracy in Libya , to attack peaceful neighborhoods of Tripoli ? ''
Cmdr .
Mike Bracken said <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2011-06-19">Sunday</TIMEX3> that NATO was doing everything it could to avoid civilian casualties , citing a case <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2011-W24">last week</TIMEX3> in which a missile was diverted after it was fired .
NATO noted that the air campaign over Libya has involved more than 11,500 sorties , ` ` and every mission is planned and executed with tremendous care to avoid civilian casualties .
NATO remains fully committed to this operation . ''
On <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2011-06-18">Saturday</TIMEX3> , the alliance denied earlier Libyan allegations it was killing civilians .
` ` The claims made by Gadhafi and members of his regime are outrageous .
It is Gadhafi and his regime that have been systematically and brutally attacking the Libyan people , '' NATO spokeswoman Oana Lungescu said in response to Libyan government accusations .
The European Union 's Foreign Affairs Council , meeting <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2011-06-20">Monday</TIMEX3> in Luxembourg , stepped up sanctions on Gadhafi 's regime , freezing assets of ` ` six port authorities under the regime 's control . ''
` ` The EU is taking further action against the military arsenal used by the regime against its own citizens , '' the organization said .
Humanitarian shipments are exempt from the measure , it added .
` ` Time is not on Gadhafi 's side , '' the organization said .
` ` He has lost all legitimacy to remain in power .
...
The time has come for a new chapter where Libyans can choose their own future . ''
<TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2011-06-20" mod="END">Late Monday</TIMEX3> , Gadhafi forces fired three rockets near the port in rebel - held Misrata , said CNN reporters , who saw the strikes from their hotel .
There were no immediate reports of casualties .
Fighting was ongoing <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2011-06-20">Monday</TIMEX3> between rebels and troops in Dafniya , west of Misrata .
Several rounds of bombardments could be heard by a CNN crew , and three dead rebels were taken to a field hospital near the front lines .
Hospital staff said 20 wounded rebels were taken to the hospital .
<TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2011-06-20" mod="START">Earlier Monday</TIMEX3> , the bodies of three other rebels were taken to a second field hospital .
At least eight people died and 30 were wounded <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="2011-06-19">Sunday</TIMEX3> in the fighting , according to records at Al - Hikma hospital and a field hospital .
Most of the dead appeared to be rebel fighters .
Ibrahim , the Libyan government spokesman , said <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="2011-06-19">Sunday</TIMEX3> the government holds NATO , British Prime Minister David Cameron , French President Nicolas Sarkozy and U.S. President Barack Obama ` ` responsible morally and legally for this murder and crimes '' for the <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="2011-06-19">Sunday</TIMEX3> incident .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="2011-06-18">Saturday</TIMEX3> , NATO acknowledged its aircraft had mistakenly struck vehicles aligned with the Libyan opposition in the hotly contested eastern oil city of al - Brega .
NATO did not provide details as to how many casualties , if any , resulted from the al - Brega strike , which took place <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DATE" value="2011-06-16">Thursday</TIMEX3> .
But in a statement <TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="DATE" value="2011-06-18">Saturday</TIMEX3> , NATO admitted its forces hit vehicles that were ` ` part of an opposition patrol , '' an incident the military alliance described as ` ` unfortunate . ''
For weeks , NATO forces have been targeting forces loyal to Gadhafi in an effort to prevent them from inflicting civilian casualties .
Most of those strikes have come from missiles fired from off - shore ships or aircraft flying high above the North African nation , though <TIMEX3 tid="t36" type="DATE" value="2011-06">this month</TIMEX3> British and French attack helicopters flew closer to the ground in al - Brega to go after targets in that city more precisely .
Al - Brega is on a frontline -- east of Gadhafi 's base in Tripoli and west of the rebels ' headquarters in Benghazi -- in fighting that has taken place between the two sides <TIMEX3 tid="t38" type="DURATION" value="PXM" mod="MORE_THAN">over the past several months</TIMEX3> .
NATO said that ` ` a column of military vehicles , including tanks '' was spotted <TIMEX3 tid="t40" type="DATE" value="2011-06-16">Thursday</TIMEX3> around al - Brega where Gadhafi forces ` ` had <TIMEX3 tid="t39" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> been operating . ''
During what it called ` ` a particularly complex and fluid battle scenario , '' leaders in the military alliance ordered a strike after determining these vehicles posed ` ` a threat to civilians . ''
` ` We regret any possible loss of life or injuries caused by this unfortunate incident , '' NATO said .
