The destroyer USS Stout launches a Tomahawk missile toward a target on Libya 's coast on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2011-03-19">Saturday</TIMEX3> .
An international military coalition including France , the United States and Great Britain attacked Libyan air - defense and other military targets <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="TIME" value="2011-03-19TNI">Saturday night</TIMEX3> in an operation that eventually will include enforcing a no - fly zone .
Libyan rebels had called on international action to help them stave off assaults by Libyan government forces on their positions in Benghazi and other enclaves .
The coalition 's intervention in Libya 's civil war comes <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P2D">two days</TIMEX3> after the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution authorizing the use of force , including a no - fly zone , to ` ` protect civilians and civilian populated areas '' from government attack .
Here is a look at how the situation got to this point , and what the major players are saying and doing .
THE START OF THE CONFLICT Libya 's civil war began <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2011-02">last month</TIMEX3> , following protests that coincided with a larger wave of demonstrations in North Africa and the Middle East against governments there .
In Libya , protesters rallied against , among other things , high unemployment and a delay in a government housing project , and they eventually called for democracy and an end to Moammar Gadhafi 's almost 42 - year - long rule .
Clashes between protesters and security forces began in Benghazi --
Libya 's second - largest city -- on <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2011-02-16">February 16</TIMEX3> , and as violence spread to other cities , opposition forces claimed control of Benghazi and other parts of eastern Libya .
In the ensuing days , the opposition and external governments accused the Libyan regime of atrocities and rights violations , including allegations of a military helicopter firing on a crowd in Benghazi , other military attacks against civilians , arbitrary detentions and summary executions .
Gadhafi 's regime responded that it was attacking al Qaeda , not civilians .
GADHAFI 'S FORCES GAIN GROUND AGAINST REBELS
At <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2011-03" mod="START">the beginning of March</TIMEX3> , the Libyan military stepped up efforts to reclaim areas lost to rebels .
Pro - Gadhafi forces marched eastward , hammering rebel positions in north - central Libya 's Ras Lanuf by <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2011-W10" mod="END">the end of last week</TIMEX3> and moving on to al - Brega and Ajdabiya .
By <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2011-W11" mod="END">the end of this week</TIMEX3> , Gadhafi 's forces were poised to strike Benghazi .
ARAB LEAGUE REQUESTS NO - FLY ZONE ; U.N. COMPLIES While the rebels pleaded for help , <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2011-W10" mod="END">late last week</TIMEX3> , the Arab League voted to ask the United Nations Security Council to impose a no - fly zone over Libya to ` ` protect the civilian population , '' league Secretary General Amre Moussa said .
