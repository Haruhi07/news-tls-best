Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- --
A grown man sobbed as friends led him out of the mosque .
Mustafa Naji al - Mrabet 's left hand and feet were bandaged , there were bloodstains on his robes , and the valve for an intravenous needle still stuck out of his arm .
He was both a husband and a father , deep in mourning .
Nearby , his brother - in - law , 26 - year - old Abubakr Ali cried like a child .
Ali pulled back the blankets covering two small coffins .
Inside lay the bloody bodies of his nephews , Mohamed and Motez al - Mrabet , ages 5 and 3 .
Their mother Ibtisam lay in a coffin beside them .
All three were killed <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="TIME" value="2011-08-04TMO" mod="START">early Thursday morning</TIMEX3> as they slept , neighbors and relatives said , when their house on the outskirts of this coastal city was hit by a NATO airstrike .
Family members said a third child , 8 - year old Naji , was in intensive care after suffering serious injuries .
Officials from Moammar Gadhafi 's embattled government brought journalists to the ruins of al - Mrabet family 's 2 - story villa in a residential neighborhood on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2011-08-04">Thursday</TIMEX3> .
` ` In all my <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P36Y">36 years</TIMEX3> I ' ve never seen <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> like this , '' said a neighbor named Salah Buharto .
He said the <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="TIME" value="2011-08-04T06:30">6:30 a.m.</TIMEX3> blast was so powerful , he initially thought his own house had been hit .
Libya 's Zlitan in rebel , NATO sights When asked about the suspected air strike , a NATO spokesman told CNN : ` ` NATO made a strike in Zlitan at <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="TIME" value="2011-08-04T06:30">6:30 a.m.</TIMEX3>
-LRB-
<TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2011-08-04">Thursday</TIMEX3> -RRB-
local time .
The target was a command and control facility held by government forces .
` ` We have had no reason to believe that there were any civilian casualties , '' said another NATO spokesman to CNN , also speaking on condition of anonymity .
` ` But we take these reports very seriously and we are looking into the matter .
We have a process that we go through . ''
For weeks , Zlitan has been the target of an intense NATO bombing campaign .
The number of buildings and compounds devastated by air strikes have visibly increased since foreign journalists were taken on a government - controlled tour of the small city <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2011-07">last month</TIMEX3> .
The Gadhafi regime accuses NATO of hitting food warehouses , health clinics and schools .
But a tour of one bomb site on <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2011-08-04">Thursday</TIMEX3> revealed evidence suggesting the target was not entirely civilian .
At the compound of a bombed - out law school where classroom walls were scorched and broken glass littered the floor , CNN found several military uniforms lying on the ground next to wooden ammunition crates .
When asked about the military paraphernalia , a government escort said the ammo boxes and uniforms ` ` belonged to school security guards . ''
Meanwhile , every few seconds , rocket and cannon fire rumbled in the distance , as rebels and regime loyalists fought a deadly artillery duel across the front lines a few miles to the east of the city .
Zlitan is located less than 50 miles west of the rebel - held port city of Misrata , which survived a long , bloody siege by Gadhafi forces .
Over <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2011-W30">the last week</TIMEX3> , rebel commanders claimed to have captured parts of Zlitan after advancing west from Misrata .
But on <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2011-08-04">Thursday</TIMEX3> , the city center appeared to remain firmly in loyalist hands .
The combined NATO and rebel offensive have clearly taken their toll on Zlitan .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2011-08-04">Thursday</TIMEX3> , the city 's streets were mostly deserted and most of the shops were closed .
Residents said they suffered from long power outages lasting <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="PT10H">10 hours</TIMEX3> or longer .
Civilian cars and an ambulance smeared with dirt -- a tactic used by both rebels and regime fighters to camouflage vehicles -- raced through the town center .
The rebel Transitional National Council and its allies in Washington , London , and Paris have long demanded that Gadhafi step down .
But <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DURATION" value="P5M" mod="MORE_THAN">more than five months</TIMEX3> after anti - Gadhafi protests first erupted across Libya , the flamboyant colonel is still clinging to power .
His government is threatening a war of attrition against his enemies .
` ` This war , this honorable confrontation , could go on for years , '' warned Gadhafi 's main spokesman , Musa Ibrahim , in a press conference on <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2011-08-03">Wednesday</TIMEX3> .
` ` We do not want it to ...
but from the beginning we were preparing ourselves to fight on the diplomatic front for years , on the military front for years , on the economic front for years . ''
As always in conflict , civilians pay the highest price .
At <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2011-08-04">Thursday</TIMEX3> 's funeral , Abubakr Ali watched volunteers carefully bury the bodies of his sister and two nephews next to the neighborhood mosque .
` ` This was a civilian home .
No army , no military , no Gadhafi forces .
It 's a family sleeping safely in their place , '' he said .
` ` This is the protection of civilians , '' Ali added with disgust .
He was referring to the United Nations Security Council resolution which authorizes the use of force in Libya in order to protect civilian lives .
As tears streamed down his face , Ali took a Kalashnikov rifle and fired a round of bullets into the air .
` ` Screw NATO and the -LRB- rebel -RRB- rats and screw those who gave the coordinates for the attack , '' he yelled .
` ` God damn you <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> and in the afterlife .
Moammar -LRB- Gadhafi -RRB- , I ' m with you until the last drop of blood . ''
