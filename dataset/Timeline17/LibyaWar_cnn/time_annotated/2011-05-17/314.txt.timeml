Luis Moreno - Ocampo is the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court .
Security forces in Libya are allegedly using sexual enhancement drugs as a ` ` machete '' and gang - raping women they stop at checkpoints , the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court has said .
Luis Moreno - Ocampo told CNN <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2011-05-16">Monday</TIMEX3> that the court in The Hague will investigate allegations of institutionalized rape in the war - torn country .
` ` There are rapes .
The issue is who organized them , '' Luis Moreno - Ocampo told CNN 's Nic Robertson .
` ` They were committed in some police barracks .
Were the policemen prosecuted ?
Moreno - Ocampo said the criminal court has information about women who were stopped at checkpoints and , because they were carrying the flag of the rebels , were taken by police and gang raped .
He also said there were reports of the use of male sexual enhancement drugs , which he called a ` ` tool of massive rape . ''
` ` There 's some information with Viagra .
So , it 's like a machete , '' he said .
` ` It 's new .
Viagra is a tool of massive rape .
` ` So we are investigating .
We are not ready to present the case yet , but I hope in the <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">coming month</TIMEX3> , we 'll add charges or review the charges for rapes . ''
In <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2011-04" mod="END">late April</TIMEX3> , various media organizations -- including Foreign Policy magazine -- reported that Susan Rice , the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , told a closed - door U.N. Security Council hearing that Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has been distributing Viagra pills to his troops ` ` so they go out and rape . ''
The magazine , which attributed the information to a U.N. diplomat in the room , said Rice did not offer any evidence to support her claim .
Pfizer , the maker of the drug , could not be reached <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="TIME" value="2011-05-17TMO" mod="START">early Tuesday morning</TIMEX3> for comment .
It was also not clear whether Moreno - Ocampo used the term ` ` Viagra '' as a catch - all for male sexual enhancement drugs in general .
Perhaps the best - known alleged rape case in Libya is that of Eman al - Obeidy .
Al - Obeidy received worldwide attention on <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2011-03-26">March 26</TIMEX3> , when she burst into the Rixos Hotel in Tripoli while journalists staying there were having breakfast .
She told reporters she had been taken from a checkpoint east of Tripoli and held against her will for <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P2D">two days</TIMEX3> while beaten and raped by 15 men loyal to Gadhafi .
While notable for the international attention it received , al - Obeidy 's case may not be an exception .
Moreno - Ocampo did not say how many women might have been raped in Libya since the start of the civil war .
` ` The shooting is in the public space .
The arresting people is so massive , so pervasive , '' said Moreno - Ocampo . ''
-LRB-
But -RRB- what happens inside the barracks with women is more difficult to know . ''
Also <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2011-05-16">Monday</TIMEX3> , the ICC sought the arrest of Gadhafi and two relatives , linking them to ` ` widespread and systematic '' attacks on civilians as they struggle to hold power in Libya .
