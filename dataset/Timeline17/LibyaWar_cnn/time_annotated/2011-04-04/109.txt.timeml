-LRB- CNN -RRB- --
Eman al - Obeidy , the woman who burst into a Tripoli hotel to tell journalists she was beaten and raped by forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2011-03">last month</TIMEX3> , is no longer in custody but says she still fears for her life .
In two telephone interviews with CNN 's ` ` AC360 , '' al - Obeidy spoke about her alleged abuse .
At times in tears , at other times defiant , she recalled men pouring alcohol into her eyes and repeatedly using rifles to sodomize her .
Al - Obeidy said has since been stopped trying to leave Libya and that she has nightmares .
` ` My life is in danger , and I call on all human rights organization ... to expose the truth and to let me leave <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> .
I am being held hostage here , '' she said .
` ` They have threatened me with death and told me I will never leave prison again , if I go to the journalists or tell them anything about what 's happening in Tripoli . ''
Al - Obeidy said she spent <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P3D">72 hours</TIMEX3> under interrogation after being dragged away from the Tripoli hotel where she tried to tell journalists about her alleged abuse .
Interrogators poured water on her face and threw food at her during the relentless questioning , which ended only after she was examined by a doctor to prove she had been raped , al - Obeidy said .
` ` And when the test came , it verified that I was raped and tortured ...
then I was freed . ''
She said the public statements from a state TV anchor and government officials , who initially called her mentally ill , drunk and a prostitute , have ruined her reputation .
Al - Obeidy said her spirits and morale are low and that she has nightmares <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> .
` ` They did not give me a chance to respond , '' she said .
The attempt to discredit al - Obeidy as a promiscuous , un - Islamic woman ties into the idea of sexual shaming in a conservative Muslim society where it 's commonly believed that a woman who has been raped has lost her honor , said Mona Eltahawy , a columnist on Arab and Muslim issues .
Woman alleges rape by Gadhafi forces Libyan woman speaks out about rape For a woman in such a society to come forward to claim she has been raped is no small thing .
` ` No one would do that unless they were raped , and especially in a conservative society , '' Eltahawy told CNN .
Al - Obeidy burst into the Rixos Hotel in Tripoli on <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2011-03-26">March 26</TIMEX3> while international journalists staying there were having breakfast .
She told reporters she had been taken from a checkpoint east of Tripoli , held against her will for <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P2D">two days</TIMEX3> and raped by 15 men .
` ` They had my hands tied behind me , and they had my legs tied , and they would hit me , while I was tied and bite me in my body .
And they would pour alcohol in my eyes so that I would not be able to see and they would sodomize me with their rifles , and they would not let us go to the bathroom .
We were not allowed to eat or drink , '' she told CNN 's ` ` AC360 , '' speaking through a translator .
` ` One man would leave and another would enter .
He would finish and then another man would come in , '' al - Obeidy said .
She said another woman being held captive was able to untie her hands and feet , allowing al - Obeidy to escape .
When CNN saw her in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2011-03">March</TIMEX3> , al - Obeidy 's legs and face were bruised and she had blood on her right inner thigh .
Her visible injuries appeared to support her allegations , but CNN could not independently verify her story .
Government officials tried to subdue her , scuffling with reporters in the process and eventually dragged her away .
Al - Obeidy said she is no longer in government custody and has spent time with her sister .

But she said she can not leave the house where she is staying as officials from the police or army will pursue her .
She said that when she tries to leave the house , officials chase her down and take her to a police station .

But police do n't know what to do with her since she is not charged with a crime , and she is released .
Al - Obeidy said she has been abducted by Gadhafi forces three times -- the first time from the hotel , the second time when she tried to escape to Tunisia <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2011-W13">last week</TIMEX3> and a third time on <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2011-04-03">Sunday</TIMEX3> .
She said the abduction <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2011-04-03">Sunday</TIMEX3> and accompanying threats were an effort to prevent her from taking her complaints to a police investigations unit .
In spite of the danger , al - Obeidy said the most important thing to her is that her voice reaches the world .
` ` I would like to direct a word to all the people watching us in America that we are a peaceful people and we are not members of al Qaeda .
We are a simple people and moderate Muslims -- not extremists -- and we are not asking for anything expect for our freedom and dignity and the most basic human rights which are denied to us , '' she said .
Her father said <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2011-04-04">Monday</TIMEX3> he has still not spoken to his daughter and begged the international community to come to her aid .
` ` What is happening to her is wrong .
What can I do ?
I have no power to do anything .
I urge the human rights organizations and all international humanitarian movements to get involved and help us , '' said Atiq Al - Obeidy .
CNN 's ` ` AC360 '' spoke with al - Obeidy <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2011-04-03">Sunday</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2011-04-04">Monday</TIMEX3> .
CNN conducted a third phone interview with her <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2011-04-04">Monday</TIMEX3> .
