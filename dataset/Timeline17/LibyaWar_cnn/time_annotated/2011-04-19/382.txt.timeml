By the CNN Wire Staff Britain to send military into Libya The EU is prepared to send troops for humanitarian assistance Opposition spokesman : 24 were killed and 113 were injured in Misrata <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2011-W16">this week</TIMEX3> He says residents in Misrata are disappointed with NATO Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Britain said <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-04-19">Tuesday</TIMEX3> it is expanding its presence in Libya with military advisers and the European Union said it is prepared to send troops for humanitarian assistance if requested by the United Nations .
Plans for increased Western involvement surfaced as Moammar Gadhafi 's forces shelled Misrata again <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2011-04-19">Tuesday</TIMEX3> .
Residents and refugees rescued from the city described a terrifying situation in the ravaged western city that continues daily to pay a heavy price in the Libyan war .
` ` The situation is very dangerous , <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EVERY">every day</TIMEX3> the shelling is increasing , '' said a resident who was not identified for safety reasons .
` ` They are using more types of weapons , and people are wondering why NATO is not doing anything . ''
The number of casualties was unclear <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2011-04-19">Tuesday</TIMEX3> but at least 24 people have already died in Misrata his week , an opposition spokesman told CNN <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011-04-18">Monday</TIMEX3> .
He said another 113 were injured .
Rebel - compiled figures estimate that more than 10,000 people have been killed so far in the Libyan conflict and more than 55,000 have been injured .
Medics overwhelmed by Misrata misery With a humanitarian disaster looming , the EU said it is ready to respond , but not without the blessing of the United Nations .
An EU official , who asked not to be identified , said it is unclear how many troops would be deployed , though he said the number would be ` ` definitely less than 1,000 . ''
The Council of the European Union agreed to the operation -- called EUFOR Libya -- <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2011-04" mod="START">earlier this month</TIMEX3> .
If requested , EUFOR Libya would ` ` contribute to the safe movement and evacuation of displaced persons '' and support humanitarian agencies in their activities , the council said in a written statement .

And Britain said it is sending a contingent of experienced military officers to the rebel stronghold of Bengazhi in an advisory role .
The team will work with Libya 's Transitional National Council on how the opposition can improve military organizational structures , communications and logistics , the British Foreign Office said .
It will also assist in the delivery of critically needed aid .
` ` This deployment is fully within the terms of UNSCR 1973 both in respect of civilian protection and its provision expressly ruling out a foreign occupation force on Libyan soil , '' Foreign Secretary William Hague said on <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2011-04-19">Tuesday</TIMEX3> .
` ` Consistent with our obligations under that resolution , our officers will not be involved in training or arming the opposition 's fighting forces .
Nor will they be involved in the planning or execution of the NTC 's military operations or in the provision of any other form of operational military advice . ''
The moves raise questions of whether a greater international military involvement on the ground could emerge .
The Center for Strategic and International Studies ' Stephen Flanagan said the British stance is another step up the level of military engagement .
He said he thinks that the British forces are trying to give ` ` more coherence '' and ` ` greater capacity '' to the efforts of the rebels to provide their own defense and that the alliance is trying to find more ways to keep up the pressure .
But he does n't think using ground troops to get in the middle of intense urban conflict and civil war is on the allies ' minds <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3> .
Keeping the pressure on Gadhafi and letting his forces know that the coalition is well intact is the hope , even if the allies do n't want to fight house to house themselves , Flanagan said .
At the same time , he said , ` ` it 's hard to speculate .
If Misrata fell would there be a turn ? ''
Another analyst , the Brookings Institution 's Michael E. O'Hanlon , questions the hesitance of ` ` casualty - averse '' Western democracies to provide aid such as military training .
He thinks more aid might turn out to be bolder and more helpful than keeping the forces they are supporting with air power at arm 's length .
He said the allies should n't content themselves with ` ` incrementalism . ''
` ` We may wind up providing some of the things we 're skittish about , '' he said .
Meanwhile , Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini said <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2011-04-19">Tuesday</TIMEX3> that the international Libya Contact Group , charged with helping map out Libya 's future , will discuss ways Libyan rebels can facilitate the sale of oil from rebel - held areas to international outlets when the contact group meets in Rome <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2011-05">next month</TIMEX3> .
Transitional National Council President Mustafa Abdul Jalil , speaking with Frattini , reminded the world again of Gadhafi 's indiscriminate attacks in population centers .
Aid groups have been attempting to pluck desperate people from Misrata , which is hemmed in by Gadhafi 's forces on three sides .
The only escape route is by sea .
The International Organization of Migration chartered boats to evacuate stranded migrant workers and Britain said it will help another 5,000 people get out .
Mohammed , an opposition spokesman who wanted to be identified only by his first name for safety reasons , said Misrata residents are disappointed with NATO , empowered by the United Nations to use force to protect civilians .

But Misrata had not seen NATO airstrikes in <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="PXD">several days</TIMEX3> , Mohammed said .
` ` Gadhafi 's forces are not threatened by NATO anymore .
The NATO planes are circulating as the destruction continues , '' he said .
NATO , however , reported progress in its mission .
As of <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2011-04-18">Monday</TIMEX3> , it had flown 771 sorties and 1,110 strike sorties .
The NATO operation destroyed seven ammunition bunkers in the Tripoli area and four air defense radars in the Misrata area <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2011-W16">this week</TIMEX3> , the alliance said , along with equipment in the areas of Zintan and Sirte , Gadhafi 's hometown .
NATO has said Gadhafi 's forces have started hiding resources in civilian areas , making airstrikes more difficult to carry out without harming civilians .

But Gadhafi 's regime has given no sign of standing down .
Valerie Amos , U.N. under - secretary - general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator , met with the Libyan regime over <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2011-W15-WE">the weekend</TIMEX3> .
` ` Let me be absolutely clear .
I got no guarantees with respect to my call for the overall cessation of hostilities to enable people to move , to enable us to deliver supplies , '' Amos said <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2011-04-18">Monday</TIMEX3> .
` ` I did get an assurance from the government to carry out a needs assessment in Misrata . ''
She added , ` ` I have to say , in that instance , we got no guarantees at all that the violence would cease . ''
