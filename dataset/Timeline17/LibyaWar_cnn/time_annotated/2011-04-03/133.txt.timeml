The Americans were better armed than the Vietcongs in Vietnam and so were the Russians , who fought the Taliban in Afghanistan .
But in both cases they lost .
One does not necessarily need sophisticated weaponry to win a war .
Even one is well equipped and has a good strategy , victory is sometimes fortuitous .

Reply I agree with u but how come you can face a tank by AK47 or a hand gun ?
it is really just the weapons what will make a difference I mean we totally out gunned but not out numbered , most weapons that u see with the rebels are old since <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="196">1960s</TIMEX3> ,
Yet they managed to free most of the eastern cities and other western cities .
so if they can get their hands on new weapons and equipment guess what !
it would n't take more than few days or weeks before they can liberate the entire Libya .

and he did support many conflicts around the world , and for this you might love him .
Regarding Libya there is no infrastructure , poor education and poor health care .
Poverty and not respecting human rights and I think it was enough that waste the country money for <TIMEX3 tid="t64" type="DURATION" value="P42Y">42 years</TIMEX3> .

The SERBS is as brutal as Qaddafi they also used the same methods to elminate the Bosnaians and croatians .
The serbs are as criminals as Qaddaffi .
But you know the Serbs will never be allowed to do business in Libya ever again after we get rid of Qaddaffi and so start backing and leave Libya you punch of criminals .

Wow !
Just from reading your comments here , I can see what a friendly little bunch you are .
Never giving facts , just insulting other people who do n't share your opinions ...
In the NATO bombing , as in any air bombing , it 's impossible for there to be no civilians killed .
So how does it help civilians to be in even more danger than they already are ?
You who support this armed rebellion and NATO bombing , do n't care for those people , you do n't want peace !
You do n't want reforms !
I never once heard you say , lets find a peaceful solution , people are dying on both sides , you never provide facts to support your statements .
People of America may be badly informed and misguided but i would like to believe even they should like some evidence of your statements , before they put even more tax money into this venture , since they already own about 40.000 US dollars per capita , while Libyan is only about 13.000 US dollars .

I don t find any difference between the Florida pastor who by burning a book wanted to make a point and those Muslims who by killing some innocent human beings who have nothing to do with this Koran burning incident .
Since 9\/11 Islam has lost all credibility in the non Muslim world , including me who a Muslim too .
Hypocrisy has taken over the Muslim world that has lost all pragmatic sense .
The wall of ignorance impregnable and any one tries to do it must be ready to face the wrath of the Muslims .
Anything critical about a 1500 years old book or its long dead author can bring millions of Muslims on the street but when Muslim suicide bombers kills thousands of their own co religionists and other innocent human beings that does not create any commotion in their mind .
By doing so Muslims only prove that they have turned their faith a cult not a religion they claim as peaceful and compassionate .
@Akbar Hussain , I agree with the rest of your comment but you say this : ` ` I don t find any difference between the Florida pastor who by burning a book wanted to make a point and those Muslims who by killing some innocent human beings who have nothing to do with this Koran burning incident . ''
You do n't see a difference between a guy exercising his constitutional right to be offensive and a mob of religious nutjobs murdering innocent people ? ?
Although burning a religious book might be seen as distasteful , is it really equivalent to and as bad as MURDER ?
C'm on , it 's just paper and ink , and no amount of paper and ink is worth a life .
The pastor might have been distasteful or a bigot or whatever you want to call him , but he did n't hurt anyone .
There 's just no equivalency hear .

But think about the impact .
There are here two sides of this sad confrontation : rational moderate people -LRB- religious and not religous -RRB- and on the other side radical extremists .
If the extremists kill innocent people , the impact is a huge feeling of hatered towards them , which leads to more confrontation and more killing in both sides .
but at the same time , burning the Quran will produce hatered from muslims that pushes them towars extremism and this will be translated in killing , sadly , innocent people .
So eventually : burning the Quran - -RRB- generates hatered , even from moderate muslims - -RRB- sadly , acts of terrorism .
But it does NOT mean that both acts are equally wrong , but they sure have the same impact on the relations between muslims and non muslims <TIMEX3 tid="t124" type="DATE" value="2011-04-04">April 4 , 2011</TIMEX3> at <TIMEX3 tid="t126" type="TIME" value="2011-04-04T01:50">1:50 am</TIMEX3> | I think you got it wrong

Libya is not that major of an exporter of oil .
Over 75 % France 's power is nuclear so oil should not be that big of a factor .
If you also recall , the countries that had a major stake in Libya 's oil market such as China , Italy , and Germany were very reluctant to help the Libyan people .
The main drawback of arming the rebels is also training them which will probably take weeks or months .
Factor in that the US involvement needs to be limited and the Obama administration is faced with an FP problem never faced before by an American president .
But he should follow through with the implicit goal of getting rid of Gaddafi using all available options apart from sending in US armed forces .

Here is an article about that , with sources like the <TIMEX3 tid="t253" type="DATE" value="2007">2007</TIMEX3> West Point Study and numerous others , all stated at the end of the article which you can read fully on the link below the excerpt ` ` Rebel Leaders Jalil and Younis , Plus Most of Rebel Council are Members of the al Qaeda - linked Harabi Tribe
The result of the present inquiry is that the Libyan branch of Al Qaeda represents a continuum with the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group centered in Darnah and Benghazi .
The ethnic base of the Libyan Islamic fighting group is apparently to be found in the anti - Qaddafi Harabi tribe , the tribe which makes up the vast majority of the rebel council including the two dominant rebel leaders , Abdul Fatah Younis and Mustafa Abdul Jalil .
The evidence thus suggests that the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group , the elite of the Harabi tribe , and the rebel council supported by Obama all overlap for all practical purposes .
As the late Foreign Minister of Guyana Fred Wills , a real fighter against imperialism and neo - colonialism , taught me <TIMEX3 tid="t254" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">many years ago</TIMEX3> , political formations in developing countries -LRB- and not just there -RRB- are often a mask for ethnic and religious rivalries ; so it is in Libya .
The rebellion against Qaddafi is a toxic brew compounded of fanatical hatred of Qaddafi , Islamism , tribalism , and localism .
From this point of view , Obama has foolishly chosen to take sides in a tribal war .
When Hillary Clinton went to Paris to be introduced to the Libyan rebels by French President Sarkozy , she met the US - educated Libyan opposition leader Mahmoud Jibril , already known to readers of Wikileaks document dumps as a favorite of the US .16
While Jibril might be considered presentable in Paris , the real leaders of the Libyan insurrection would appear to be Jalil and Younis , both former ministers under Qaddafi .
Jalil seems to be the primus inter pares , at least for the moment : Mustafa Abdul Jalil or Abdul - Jalil -LRB-
Arabic : , also transcribed Abdul - Jelil , Abd - al - Jalil , Abdel - Jalil or Abdeljalil ; and frequently but erroneously as Abud Al Jeleil -RRB- -LRB-
born <TIMEX3 tid="t256" type="DATE" value="1952">1952</TIMEX3> -RRB- is a Libyan politician .
He was the Minister of Justice -LRB- unofficially , the Secretary of the General People s Committee -RRB- under Colonel Muammar al - Gaddafi .
Abdul Jalil has been identified as the Chairman of the National Transitional Council based in Benghazi although this position is contested by others in the uprising due to his past connections to Gaddafi s regime .
17 As for Younis , he has been closely associated with Qaddafi since the <TIMEX3 tid="t257" type="DATE" value="1968">1968</TIMEX3> - 9 seizure of power : Abdul Fatah Younis -LRB-
Arabic : -RRB- is a senior military officer in Libya .
He held the rank of General and the post of Minister of Interior , but resigned on <TIMEX3 tid="t260" type="DATE" value="2011-02-22">22 February 2011</TIMEX3> .
18
What should concern us most is that both Jalil and Younis come from the Haribi tribe , the dominant one in northeast Libya , and the one that overlaps with al Qaeda .
According to Stratfor , the Harabi tribe is a historically powerful umbrella tribe in eastern Libya that saw their influence wane under Col . Gadhafi .
The Libyan leader confiscated swaths of tribal members land and redistributed it to weaker and more loyal tribes .
Many of the leaders <TIMEX3 tid="t263" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> emerging in eastern Libya hail from the Harabi tribe , including the head of the provisional government set up in Benghazi , Abdel Mustafa Jalil , and Abdel Fatah Younis , who assumed a key leadership role over the defected military ranks early in the uprising .
19
This is like a presidential ticket where both candidates are from the same state , except that Libya s ferocious tribal rivalries make the problem infinitely worse .
The Rebel Council : Half the Names Are Kept Secret ;
Why ?
This picture of a narrow , sectarian tribal and regional base does not improve when we look at the rebel council as a whole .
According to one <TIMEX3 tid="t264" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> version , the rebel council is chaired by the well - spoken former justice minister for Libya , Mustafa Abdul Jalil , -LRB- and -RRB- consists of 31 members , ostensibly representatives from across Libya , of whom many can not be named for security reasons .
The key players on the council , at least those who we know about , all hail from the north - eastern Harabi confederation of tribes .
These tribes have strong affiliations with Benghazi that date back to before the <TIMEX3 tid="t265" type="DATE" value="1969">1969</TIMEX3> revolution which brought Gaddafi to power .
20 Other accounts agree about the number of representatives : The council has 31 members ; the identities of several members has not been made public to protect their own safety .
21
Given what we know about the extraordinary density of LIFG and all Qaeda fanatics in northeast Libya , we are authorized to wonder as to whether so many members of the council are being kept secret in order to protect them from Qaddafi , or whether the goal is to prevent them from being recognized in the west as al Qaeda terrorists or sympathizers .
The latter seems to be a more accurate summary of the real state of affairs .
Names released so far include : Mustafa Abduljaleel ; Ashour Hamed Bourashed of Darna city ; Othman Suleiman El - Megyrahi of the Batnan area ; Al Butnan of the Egypt border and Tobruk ; Ahmed Abduraba
Al - Abaar of Benghazi city ; Fathi Mohamed Baja of Benghazi city ; Abdelhafed Abdelkader Ghoga of Benghazi city ; Mr. Omar El - Hariri for Military Affairs ; and Dr. Mahmoud Jibril , Ibrahim El - Werfali and Dr. Ali Aziz Al - Eisawi for foreign affairs .22
The State Department needs to interrogate these figures , starting perhaps with Ashour Hamed Bourashed , the delegate from the terrorist and suicide bomber stronghold of Darnah .
How Many al Qaeda Members , Veterans , or Sympathizers are on the Rebel Council ?
Seeing as clearly as we can in the fog of war , it looks like slightly more than a dozen of the members of the rebel council have had their names officially published in any case , not more than half of the reported 31 members .

The US and European media have not taken the lead in identifying for us the names that are <TIMEX3 tid="t266" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> known , and they above all have not called attention to the majority of the rebel council who are still lurking in the shadows of total secrecy .
We must therefore demand to know how many LIFG and\/or al Qaeda members , veterans , or sympathizers <TIMEX3 tid="t267" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> hold seats on the rebel council .
We are thus witnessing an attempt by the Harabi tribe to seize dominance over the 140 tribes of Libya .
The Harabi are already practically hegemonic among the tribes of Cyrenaica .
At the center of the Harabi Confederation is the Obeidat tribe , which is divided into 15 sub - tribes .23
All of this might be of purely academic ethnographic interest , were it not for the fact of the striking overlap between the Harabi tribe and the LIFG and al Qaeda . ''
Of course the rebels should be helped .
How else will they manage to withstand the might of th libyan army ?

At least the U.S. can officially recognize the TNC and help them by giving positioning information of Gaddafis troops in the battle field using satellites and ofcourse giving them modern communication equipment .
The U.S. should recognize the freedom fighters as official allies and simply help them by giving them precious info about Gaddafis troops and build a straight communication line between them and the fighters .
Gaddafi is trying to whipe out the remaining resistance in western part -LRB-
The whole mountain area from Nalut to Yefren and Misrata -RRB-
so he can have the whole western part for himself and so he can something to negotiate with .
Or maybe even rule the remaining half of the country .
Sadly NATO has n't done anything for the western part and this is giving a clear message to Gaddafi to continue .

The Rebels are , on the whole , undisciplined and untrained and will need to be trained in many of the sophisticated weapons that the coalition could supply .
There is no guarantee that they would overwhelm Gaddafi forces even with better weapons .
Strike and counter strike in civilian areas would inevitably lead to civilian deaths , just the thing UN res <TIMEX3 tid="t327" type="DATE" value="1973">1973</TIMEX3> was trying to stop .
Gaddafi is already using kidnap and kill squads that have infiltrated the Rebel held cities and if Gaddafi feels he is going to loose he will sponsor a counter insurgency with terrorist tactics like car bombs .
Weapons to the rebels will not help against car bombs .
Splits in the Coalition and UN would inevitably occur if it was obvious that the arming of the Rebels was to effect regime change by proxy .
A preferable solution would be for the coalition special forces to covertly locate and kill Gaddafi and his sons together with close members of the regime and by any means available .
This would involve some civilian deaths as Gaddafi will use them as human shields .
Despite the overwhelming hatred of Gaddafi by the Libyan people , there are still a number of his supporters in Tripoli who may get caught in the cross - hairs .
The civilian casualties would however be small compared to that produced by months or even years of a civil war .
The only people to benefit from arming one side or another is arms manufacturers .
The arms could be captured by Gaddafis men and then used against the Rebels in much the same way that the Rebels have attacked Gadaffi forces with captured Gadaffi weapons .
Finally we have to consider what will happen to the arms after Gaddafi is deposed .
They could well find their way onto the black market and into the hands of terrorists .

What type of arms do you give them ?
Even US soldiers need extensive training on US weapons before they are ready for combat .
US - made weapons are quite complex , and they take a lot of maintenance .
In the dust and grim of the battlefield , particularly in Libya , these weapons would be useless unless there is adequate training and maintenance .
<TIMEX3 tid="t372" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Right now</TIMEX3> the rebels are using Soviet\/Russian - made weapons captured from the Gaddafi forces .
RPG-7 's , AK-74 's , 12.7 mm -LRB- .50
cal -RRB- heavy machine guns , Katyusha and Grad rocket launchers .
These weapons systems are robust require far less training to use .
They are ` ` point and shoot '' weapons , which the rebels have mastered in short period of time .
They also require far less maintenance than US - made weapons .
We should arm the rebels , but what do we do ?
Should we buy Russian - made or -LRB- gulp -RRB-
Chinese - made weapons .
That seems to be the logical choice , but it wo n't set well with the US taxpayer .
Also Russia and China both have distanced themselves from the Libyan intervention , though I am sure they will hold their nose and take the money , then deliver the weapons in unmarked ships to the NATO ports .

The truth is that the official libyan army is fighting the group of heavily armed rebels who deliberately choses to fight in towns , rather than on the open where civillian victims could be avoided .

Here are some examples : All citizens are able to obtain interest - free loans , during the study academics have received an average wage for an occupation for which they where educating , if someone can find a job after graduation , the state will paid him as he does the job in his profession , for entry in marriage the state pays flat or a house , vehicles were able to buy at factory prices , There are also free health care and education , for 15 cents you could buy 40 pieces of bread , 25 percent of people have a higher education and do not owe anyone a cent ...
I wiil change my democracy for Gaddafi 's dictatorship .
Show this to the American people , open their eyes .

However , sending more arms into the situation amounts to adding fuel to a fire we are trying to extinguish .
In addition , military - grade weapons are often used much later for different purposes and not always in our interest .

Stop calling them rebels .
Provide arms and other nonlethal help including communications , phones , advice and training .
Gaddafi forces around Misrata and Zintan must be immediately destroyed .
The US and Western governments should also shut Gaddafi out and recognize the National Transitional Council as the sole representative of the Libyan people .
It is a win - win situation .
The free world could not ask for a better , or more moral cause .

Armed forces with traces of Al Qaeda and CIA stirring the pot , are not what I would call a Revolution .
The government forces reacted only after the riots started and the fires were put on public buildings .
How do you think the American police would react to that ?

If indeed all the people of Libya support you , how come the Libyan army have n't met with resistance in all those towns you left running away <TIMEX3 tid="t450" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> .
Why did n't they help you with your fight , when we know that many houses in Libya have rifles ?

To establish what s needed I think somebody should set up a temporary mobile network along the north coast & along the borders , provide free access and air dropping phones with cameras into those population centres that are cut or being suppressed .
It s very dangerous for those journalist near Gaddafi and his supporters , at any moment this crazy self centred dictator could take their lives in another propaganda exercise .
These people could use a trusted symbol to unit behind ; ` ` Even a poster that can be placed in the streets '' one that clearly say s No to dictators , theorist or any other narrow minded , self interested groups or gangs .

+ I think a new style of democracy built on better foundations is still the only long - term answer .
It 's a must , it 's true that US weapons tend to be more complex and less robust that russian 's but lets not forget that a lot of the fighter are ex soldiers and a lot of them are from the special forces regiment , plus i do nt think it 's that tricky to train soldiers to use heavy cannons and anti tank missiles , armored vehicles , body armors , sniper rifles , heavy machine guns and night vision goggles should be on list too and also need not too much training <TIMEX3 tid="t460" type="DATE" value="2011-04-04">April 4 , 2011</TIMEX3> at <TIMEX3 tid="t464" type="TIME" value="2011-04-04T12:13">12:13 am</TIMEX3> |

What is also ridiculous is that a no - fly zone or any action at all was not taken UNTIL Gadhafi announced he would no longer be honoring his oil contracts with Western Countries , and would be seeking to sign new contracts with the likes of Russia and China .
This entire problem is caused by powers such as and almost entirely by the U.S. and <TIMEX3 tid="t511" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> they 're going to arm the people ?

If NATO was anything like it was <TIMEX3 tid="t512" type="DATE" value="1991">20 years or so ago</TIMEX3> , we would be sending in the ` ` blue helmets '' ensuring peace and bringing both parties to the table to discuss reasonable ways of resolving the problem , but that would require this situation to have to be about internal politics , and it 's really only all about OIL .

Either way , the Libyan people will lose in all of this , because the interests of the U.S. will prevail .
What really needs to happen is the U.S. population needs to wake up and demand transparency and honesty from its government and to quit meddling in other countries affairs , but that will most probably never happen because people would rather raise the flag way above their heads then to be aware of the horrific truth .

How dare a foreign country demand Gaddafi to step down , when he spent <TIMEX3 tid="t560" type="DURATION" value="P42Y">42 years</TIMEX3> building that country ?
Why do n't you rebels tell us exactly what it is that you want changed in the way of life in Libya that you are prepared to kill and get killed for it ?
From what I read and hear from my Libyan friends , there is n't much that you are not provided with .
Free education , free health care , payed studies , even in foreign countries , almost everybody in Libya has a house or appartment , natality is +2.47 , average life exp .

there are jobs obviously , but the libyan youth preffers to stay home than work manual jobs that they pay foreigners to do -RRB-
So , please tell me what do you want ?
Do you realize you do n't get that even in west ?

At the time , Libya was home to the largest US Air Base -LRB- Wheelus Air Base -RRB- in North Africa .
Agreements between the USA and Libya signed in <TIMEX3 tid="t743" type="DATE" value="1951">1951</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t744" type="DATE" value="1954">1954</TIMEX3> granted the USAF the use of Wheelus Air Base and its El Watia gunnery range for gunnery and bombing training and for transport and bombing stopovers until <TIMEX3 tid="t745" type="DATE" value="1971">1971</TIMEX3> .
During the Cold War the base was pivotal to expanding US military power under the Strategic Air Command , and an essential base for fighter and reconnaissance missions .
The Pentagon also used the base - and the remote Libyan desert - for missile launch testing : the launch area was located 15 miles east of Tripoli .
Considered a ` little America on the shores of the Mediteranean ' , the base housed some 4600 US military personnel until its evacuation in <TIMEX3 tid="t746" type="DATE" value="1970">1970</TIMEX3> .
With the discovery of oil in Libya in <TIMEX3 tid="t747" type="DATE" value="1959">1959</TIMEX3> , a very poor desert country became a very rich little western protectorate .
US and European companies had huge stakes in the extremely lucrative petroleum and banking sectors , but these were soon nationalized by Gaddafi .
Thus Libya overnight joined the list of US ` enemy ' or ` rogue ' states that sought autonomy and self - determination outside the expanding sphere of western Empire .
Further cementing western hatred of the new regime , Libya played a leading role of the <TIMEX3 tid="t748" type="DATE" value="1973">1973</TIMEX3> oil embargo against the US and maintained cooperative relations with the Soviet Union .
Gaddafi also reportedly channeled early oil wealth into national free health care and education .

What do you even know of Gaddafi 's foreign policy ?
Do you know how much he helped develop some of those African countries ?
Do you know that he was one of the most distinguished helpers of Nelson Mandela in a fight against apartheid ?
That 's why the Eastern Libyans hate the black people of Africa so much .
They think Gaddafi should n't have ` ` wasted '' the oil money to help develop Africa and it 's black people .
Whenever the rebels found black people in the places they went , they killed them , stating that those were Gaddafi 's mercenaries .

Despite the repeated claims by Obama administration officials that the rebels are a largely unknown quantity , it is becoming increasingly clear that key military leaders of the anti - Gaddafi campaign are well known to the US government and have longstanding relations with the CIA .
For better than <TIMEX3 tid="t820" type="DURATION" value="P2W">two weeks</TIMEX3> there had been a virtual ban in the US media on reporting the name of Khalifa Haftar , the long - time CIA collaborator who was appointed chief rebel commander <TIMEX3 tid="t819" type="DATE" value="2011-03-17">March 17</TIMEX3> , on the eve of the US - NATO bombing campaign against Libya .
Only the regional McClatchy Newspapers chain reported Haftar s appointment , and ABC News ran a brief interview with him on <TIMEX3 tid="t822" type="DATE" value="2011-03-27">March 27</TIMEX3> .
Otherwise , silence prevailed .
This de facto censorship abruptly ended <TIMEX3 tid="t824" type="DATE" value="2011-04-01">April 1</TIMEX3> , when a right - wing US think tank , the Jamestown Foundation , published a lengthy study of Haftar s background and record , which was cited extensively by Reuters news service , and then more widely in the US and British media .

NATO warships also stopped two ships in the Mediterranean Sea near Libya , but did not board them .
At least some of the strikes hit a small village called Zawia el Argobe , near Brega .
The village doctor said the strike hit a truck carrying ammunition , and the subsequent explosion killed seven civilians and wounded 25 others .
Among the dead were children as young as 12 .
Though NATO and the US have been shrugging off most reports of civilian killings in their strikes , they have come under renewed scrutiny since a top Catholic official in Tripoli said that his city alone lost 40 civilians in the bombing campaigns .
The US was keen to push for a NATO takeover of the Libyan War , and much is being made of the 16 NATO members participating in the war .
The reality , however , is that the US and France are still contributing a large majority of the attack force .

they are not a group .
they represent all Libyans .
Qaddafi bring Mercenaries from other countries to kill Libyans .

The most striking finding which emerges from the West Point study is that the corridor which goes from Benghazi to Tobruk , passing through the city of Darnah -LRB- also transliterated as Derna -RRB- them represents one of the greatest concentrations of jihadi terrorists to be found anywhere in the world , and by some measures can be regarded as the leading source of suicide bombers anywhere on the planet .
Darnah , with one terrorist fighter sent into Iraq to kill Americans for every 1,000 to 1,500 persons of population , emerges as suicide bomber heaven , easily surpassing the closest competitor , which was Riyad , Saudi Arabia . '' ''
...
But since the Al Qaeda personnel files contain the residence or hometown of the foreign fighters in question , we can determine that the desire to travel to Iraq to kill Americans was not evenly distributed across Libya , but was highly concentrated precisely in those areas around Benghazi which are <TIMEX3 tid="t883" type="DATE" value="2011-04-03">today</TIMEX3> the epicenters of the revolt against Colonel Gaddafi which the US , Britain , France , and others are so eagerly supporting .
As Daya Gamage of the Asia Tribune comments in a <TIMEX3 tid="t884" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> article on the West Point study , alarmingly for Western policymakers , most of the fighters came from eastern Libya , the center of the <TIMEX3 tid="t885" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> uprising against Muammar el - Qaddafi .
The eastern Libyan city of Darnah sent more fighters to Iraq than any other single city or town , according to the West Point report .
It noted that 52 militants came to Iraq from Darnah , a city of just 80,000 people -LRB- the second - largest source of fighters was Riyadh , Saudi Arabia , which has a population of more than 4 million -RRB- .
Benghazi , the capital of Libya s provisional government declared by the anti - Qaddafi rebels , sent in 21 fighters , again a disproportionate number of the whole .
4 Obscure Darnah edged out metropolitan Riyadh by 52 fighters to 51 .
Qaddafi s stronghold of Tripoli , by contrast , barely shows up in the statistics at all .

You can find the West Point study here to download , or read excerpts .
The only way to get ready of international terrorism is by eliminating the power and reach of all tyrants like GADDAFY from the face of this plant .
All Tyrant should be picked and handed back to their own people to take care of them Once and for all .
If You guys -LRB- west -RRB- have change your mine about Gaddafy and decide to keep him or one of his sons around for any longer , then , I can assure you it will be the wrong signal sent to the world .
Gaddafy , his family and all of the gang surrounding him MUST GO OUT OF LIBYA NOW .

The Western media are basing a great deal of their reporting on supposed facts provided by the exile group National Front for the Salvation of Libya , which was trained and financed by the U.S. CIA .
Google the front s name plus CIA and you will find hundreds of references .
The Wall Street Journal in a <TIMEX3 tid="t907" type="DATE" value="2011-02-23">Feb. 23</TIMEX3> editorial wrote that The U.S. and Europe should help Libyans overthrow the Gadhafi regime .
There is no talk in the board rooms or the corridors of Washington about intervening to help the people of Kuwait or Saudi Arabia or Bahrain overthrow their dictatorial rulers .
Even with all the lip service being paid to the mass struggles rocking the region <TIMEX3 tid="t908" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3> , that would be unthinkable .
As for Egypt and Tunisia , the imperialists are pulling every string they can to get the masses off the streets .
There was no talk of U.S. intervention to help the Palestinian people of Gaza when thousands died from being blockaded , bombed and invaded by Israel .
The U.S. intervened to prevent condemnation of the Zionist settler state .

Bloomberg.com wrote on <TIMEX3 tid="t909" type="DATE" value="2011-02-22">Feb. 22</TIMEX3> that while Libya is Africa s third - largest producer of oil , it has the continent s largest proven reserves 44.3 billion barrels .
It is a country with a relatively small population but the potential to produce huge profits for the giant oil companies .
That s how the super - rich look at it , and that s what underlies their professed concern for the people s democratic rights in Libya .

The opposition is not a monolithic body .
The common denominator is the opposition to the rule of Qaddafi and his family .
It has to be said that actions of opposition or resistance against an oppressor and an opposition movement are also two different things .
For the most part , the common people and corrupt Libyan officials , who harbor deep - seated hate towards Qaddafi and his family , are <TIMEX3 tid="t936" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> in the same camp , but there are differences .
There is an authentic form of opposition , which is not organized , and a systematic form of opposition , which is either external or led by figures from within the Libyan regime itself .
The authentic people s internal opposition in Libya is not organized and the people s actions of opposition have been spontaneous .
Yet , opposition and revolt has been encouraged and prompted from outside Libya through social media networks , international news stations , and events in the rest of the Arab World .
The leadership of the internal opposition that is emerging in Libya is coming from within the regime itself .
Corrupt officials that have rebelled against Gaddafi are not the champions of the people .
These opposition figures are not opposed to tyranny ; they are merely opposed to the rule of Colonel Qaddafi and his family .
Aref Sharif and Al - Yunis are themselves Libyan regime figures .
It has to also be considered that some Libyan officials that have turned against Qaddafi are doing it to save themselves , while others in the future will work to retain or strengthen their positions .
Abdel Moneim Al - Honi , the Libyan envoy to the Arab League in Cairo , can be looked at as an example .
Al - Honi denounced Qaddafi , but it should be noted that he was one of the members of the group of Libyan officers who executed the coup in <TIMEX3 tid="t937" type="DATE" value="1969">1969</TIMEX3> with Qaddafi and that later in <TIMEX3 tid="t938" type="DATE" value="1975">1975</TIMEX3> he himself tried to take power in a failed coup .
After the failed coup , he would flee Libya and only return in <TIMEX3 tid="t939" type="DATE" value="1990">1990</TIMEX3> after Qaddafi pardoned him
Al - Honi is not the only Libyan diplomat to resign .
The Libyan ambassador to India has also done the same .
There is an intention on the part of these officials to be members of the power structure in a Libya after the ouster of Qaddafi : Libyan Ambassador to India Ali al - Essawi told the BBC that he was quitting , opposing his government 's violent crackdown on demonstrators .
Mr. Al - Essawi was reported to be a Minister in Tripoli and could be an important figure in an alternative government , in case Libyan President Muammar Qadhafi steps down .
The second Libyan diplomat to put in his papers was Tripoli 's Permanent Representative to the Arab League Abdel Moneim al - Honi , who said in Cairo that he had quit his job to join the revolution in his country .
I have submitted my resignation in protest against the acts of repression and violence against demonstrators , and I am joining the ranks of the revolution , said Mr. Al - Honi .
The Second Secretary Hussein Sadiq al Musrati , announced his resignation from China , in an interview with Al - Jazeera , and called on the Army to intervene in the uprising .
The leadership of the internal opposition that is emerging in Libya is coming from within the regime itself .
Corrupt officials that have rebelled against Gaddafi are not the champions of the people .
These opposition figures are not opposed to tyranny ; they are merely opposed to the rule of Colonel Qaddafi and his family .
Aref Sharif and Al - Yunis are themselves Libyan regime figures .
Any way everybody want to be Master of free -LRB- OIL -RRB- dom ...
but they forget that is only one president can be in one country .
You can see on this map -LRB- down -RRB- only Libya is free ...
I can not understund why somebody want to be Lord of the world ?

Open letter from Russian doctors in Libya to President of the Russian Federation from citizens of Ukraine , Belarus and Russia , working and living in Libya <TIMEX3 tid="t1031" type="DATE" value="2011-03-24">March 24 , 2011</TIMEX3> , Tripoli ,
Libya Dear Mr Medvedev and Vladimir Putin , Citizens of the former Soviet Union refer to you .
<TIMEX3 tid="t1033" type="DATE" value="2011-04-03">Today</TIMEX3> we are citizens of different Slavonic countries -- Ukraine , Belarus and Russia .
Despite this , we all believe that Russia is a successor to the USSR and is the ONLY protector of interests of our countries and security of our citizens .
Therefore , we call to you for help and justice .
It s clearly an outrageous AGGRESSION of the USA and NATO against the SOVEREIGN STATE Libya .
And if anyone has doubts , it s clear for us , because all this is happening beneath our eyes , and the actions of U.S. and NATO threaten lives of not only Libyan civilians , but of all human beings on Lybian territory .
We are outraged by the barbaric bombing of Libya , which is <TIMEX3 tid="t1034" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> carried out by coalition of U.S. and NATO .
The bombings of Tripoli and other cities in Libya are aimed not only on military targets and Libyan army , but on civilian infrastructure as well .
<TIMEX3 tid="t1039" type="DATE" value="2011-04-03">Today</TIMEX3> , <TIMEX3 tid="t1037" type="DATE" value="2011-03-24">24 March 2011</TIMEX3> , NATO and U.S. aircraft were bombing a suburb of Tripoli -- Tajura -LRB- where , in particular , is Libya 's Nuclear Research Centre -RRB- trough all night and early afternoon .
Air Defense and Air Force facilities in Tajura were destroyed during the first <TIMEX3 tid="t1042" type="DURATION" value="P2D">2 days</TIMEX3> of air strikes .
There are much more military facilities in the city but <TIMEX3 tid="t1043" type="DATE" value="2011-04-03">today</TIMEX3> Libyan army barracks were targeted .
Moreover there is a high density inhabited area around it .
Air strikes also damaged the largest Libyan Heart Surgery Centre .
Civilians and doctors could not imagine that residential areas will be attacked by fire as well , so none of the residents or hospital patients was evacuated .
Bombs and missiles struck residential houses , some dropped near the hospital .
The windows in the Cardiac Centre building were shuttered , and the wall and part of the roof of the building of the maternity ward for pregnant women with heart disease collapsed .
This lead to a ten miscarriages , the women are <TIMEX3 tid="t1044" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> in intensive care , doctors are fighting for their lives .
We and our colleagues are working <TIMEX3 tid="t1046" type="DURATION" value="P7D">seven days</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t1047" type="DURATION" value="P1W">a week</TIMEX3> to save people .
A consequence of falling bombs and missiles in residential buildings is dozens of deaths and injuries , which are <TIMEX3 tid="t1048" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> being treated by our doctors .
Enormous number of killed and injured only for <TIMEX3 tid="t1049" type="DURATION" value="P1D">one day</TIMEX3> .
By the way those horrible figures are much higher than during all the riots all together .
And this is being called ` ` protecting the civilian population '' ?
With full responsibility as witnesses and participants of what is happening , we state that it is a genocide carried out by the United States and its allies against the Libyan people -- as it already happened in Yugoslavia , Afghanistan and Iraq .
These are crimes against humanity , carried out by coalition forces are similar to those committed by fathers and grandfathers of <TIMEX3 tid="t1050" type="DATE" value="2011-04-03">today</TIMEX3> 's Western leaders and their henchmen in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan and in Dresden in Germany , where civilians were also killed for seeding terror , to break the will of the people to resist -LRB-
Germany remembers it , and therefore refused to participate in the new mayhem -RRB- .
<TIMEX3 tid="t1051" type="DATE" value="2011-04-03">Today</TIMEX3> they want to make the Libyan people to give up their leader and the legitimate government and calmly surrender their national wealth to the countries of the coalition We understand that appealing to the ` ` international community '' to save the people of Libya and us living in Libya , is useless .

Those are American Government fact studies of Libya and I do n't take them without some reserve , if you have something more accurate , please share it with us .
Speak with facts , or even if it 's a speculation , give us some source .

You should try democracy !
You should start loaning money from Western banks , as they robe you from your wealth , and then try to explain to your children and grandchildren what you were fighting for .

You will be a slave to the Great Investing Cartels of the West , as we all are .
Here in Greece , in a beautiful touristic area where I live , the Foreign companies -LRB- with Roth ...
d hands in them -RRB- have gained the government approval to dig for gold in a place near to the source of the only river in the area .
It has been proven by the scientists and the doctors that this could be highly dangerous for the area , because of high % of Arsenic , Cyanide and Sulfur that are released in the area .
But because those cartels are financing both political parties that hold the majority of seats in the parliament , and the scientist get paid to shut up , we are <TIMEX3 tid="t1081" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> facing something that could destroy our water supply , agriculture , honey production and tourism .

And that for only about 1.5 t. of gold they believe they can extract .
What do you think they have in store for you with so much oil ?

Oh , and the reason I did n't finish the name of one of the investors , is that one men dared to state the name of the Mining company in connection with the potential danger , and got sued for it , they are <TIMEX3 tid="t1082" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> asking him to pay 1.000.000,00 EUR as a fine ! ! ! !

We as Libyans on believe NATO plying games to put pressure on Libyans revolution to dictates the post Gaddaffi era or alternatively to stabilises Gaddaffi regime .
We hear from our people in Libya NATO targeting the less important and useless bases of Gaddaffi and keeping the big obvious targets functioning in full capacity .

If you were in Libya doing this , you would be kidnapped , tortured , raped and killed or just shot outright .
I know this is true because I live in Benghazi , Libya .
I am not in Benghazi <TIMEX3 tid="t1302" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> or I would n't be able to write this .
There is no internet allowed in Libya except for a minority of people who have some very unusual resources .
I grew up in America and I was taught that Americans believe that the rights and freedoms that they enjoy are universal and all the people of the world should have the same rights and freedoms .
<TIMEX3 tid="t1303" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> in Libya , very brave people have stood up to a dictator who has ruled them mercilessly for <TIMEX3 tid="t1305" type="DURATION" value="P40Y" mod="MORE_THAN">over 40 years</TIMEX3> .
These people have been threatened by their government to be hunted out inch by inch , house by house , room by room , alley by alley and person by person and destroyed because they are rats and germs .
<TIMEX3 tid="t1308" type="DATE" value="2011-03-19">Last March 19th</TIMEX3>
this despot very nearly carried out this threat against Benghazi , but the coallition led by France , Britian and America stepped in and prevented a massacre .
<TIMEX3 tid="t1309" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Right now</TIMEX3> many other cities in Libya are under heavy artillary fire by Ghaddafi 's forces .
Men , women and children are being killed and injured <TIMEX3 tid="t1310" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EVERY">every day</TIMEX3> .
The people in Libya are begging for NATO air strikes against these forces .
The oil fields of Msala and Sireer were completely destroyed <TIMEX3 tid="t1311" type="DATE" value="2011-04-03">today</TIMEX3> by missiles from columns of tanks .
There are many ancient sites in Libya some UNESCO world heritage sites .
Will NATO be there if Ghaddafi decides to destroy them ?
The people in Libya are being shot with the same weapons which should be used to protect them .
These weapons were bought and paid for with the wealth of the nation that should have been used for the benefit of the people .
Libya has no defensive army .
It has instead a highly armed ` ` palace guard '' designed to protect Muammar Ghaddafi and his family .
Neither American or Libyan people want American solders on the ground in Libya .
What the pro - democracy fighters in Libya do need is some support form NATO and training and weapons .
The United States is very good at verbally encouraging the spread of democracy and condemning the abuse of human rights .
In Libya <TIMEX3 tid="t1312" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3> , The United States has a unique opportunity to prove that it can do more than just talk the talk .
The pro - democracy movement in Libya is grass - roots and genuine .
Libya is an example for other governments in the region who repress their people .
If the Libyan people are not given support in real tangible ways , like air strikes and weapons , other dictators will be confirmed in their beliefs that all The United States does is talk .

But , if America gives the pro - democracy fighters real support <TIMEX3 tid="t1313" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> , it will prove that America is more than just talk .
America walks the walk , America stands behind the pretty words about freedom , democracy and human rights .
I am proud of my Libyan brothers and sisters fighting for freedom .
I hope that I can be proud of my American brothers and sisters for standing behind what they believe and doing what should be done when it counts .

Unlike the autocratic rulers of Egypt and Tunisia , Gaddafi has secured a mass regional base among a substantial sector of the Libyan population .
This support is based on the fact that almost two generations of Libyans have benefited from Gaddafi s petroleum - financed welfare , educational , employment and housing programs , none of which existed under America s favorite , King Idris .
Since violence is inherent in any armed uprising , once one picks up the gun to seize power , they lose their claim on civil rights .
In armed civil conflicts , civil rights are violated on all sides .

Regardless of the Western media s lurid portrayal of Gaddafi s African mercenary forces and its more muted approval of revolutionary justice against Gaddafi supporters and government soldiers captured in the rebel strongholds , the rules of warfare should have come into play , including the protection of non - combatants - civilians -LRB- including government supporters and officials -RRB- , as well as protection of Libyan prisoners of war in the areas under NATO - rebel control .
The unsubstantiated Euro - US claim of genocide amplified by the mass media and parroted by left spokespersons is contradicted by the daily reports of single and double digit deaths and injuries , resulting from urban violence on both sides , as control of cities and towns shifts between the two sides .
Truth is the first casualty of war , and especially of civil war .
Both sides have resorted to monstrous fabrications of victories , casualties , monsters and victims .
Demons and angels aside , this conflict began as a civil war between two sets of Libyan elites : An established paternalistic , <TIMEX3 tid="t1319" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> burgeoning neo - liberal , autocracy with substantial popular backing versus a western imperialist financed and trained elite , backed by an amorphous group of regional , tribal and clerical chiefs , monarchists and neo - liberal professionals devoid of democratic and nationalist credentials and lacking broad - based mass support .

We are deeply concerned about the <TIMEX3 tid="t1334" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> situation in Libya and the war crimes and atrocities that have been committed by the Gaddafi fascist regime since <TIMEX3 tid="t1332" type="DATE" value="2011-02-15">February 15 , 2011</TIMEX3> .
INTERPOL - UN Special Notices are designed to allow INTERPOL to assist the UN directly in making its sanctions effective .
Since the Gaddafi regime has lost its legitimacy as the representative of the Libyan people , we urge you to express your solidarity with the Libyan citizens and abide by the UN Security Council resolution and INTERPOL that forbids aiding and abetting this criminal regime .
The citizens of Libya urge you to : Discontinue the broadcasting of all of the Gaddafi regime s satellite channels , in particular the Jamahirya satellite channel , and alshababia that are being broadcast by your satellites because it is mainly broadcast lies , threats , promote hatred , and genocide .
The illegitimate Gaddafi regime has been using your satellite services to spread its terror propaganda to the Libyans citizens and people around the world .
Furthermore , there have been reports from Libya that coded messages have been disseminated to Gaddafi s mercenaries and security forces via Al - Jamahirya satellite TV channel .
It is imperative for us -LRB- the Libyans -RRB- to notify all organizations\/companies that are providing communication logistics for the survival of this fascist regime that their continued support is a violation of the UN resolution .
I thank you all in advance .

Such legality is debatable in light of point 9 in Resolution 1970 concerning the arms embargo on Libyan Arab Jamahiriya .
So , if there are any dissenting voices coming from any of the UN Member States over providing arms to the regime s opponents , I would say it is time for the United Nations to clarify what is meant by an arms embargo on Libyan Arab Jamahiriya , and have member states vote again on a reworded resolution .
In view of past humanitarian disasters , I think it is vital that nobody in the coalition proceed with action where its legality is debatable .

the US\/NATO briought the world the destruction of Yugoslavia , Iraq , Afghanistan , and do the sick minds of the Libyan opposition believe they wo nt do the same to Libya ?
will they then leave ?
No point in answering such stupid question !
Under normal circumstances , I 'd say NO , since we ' ve all seen who they armed in the past : terrorists\/warlords\/war criminals such as Bin Laden , Sadam or organ thieves from Kosovo Liberation Army ...
the list goes on .
In addition to arming them , they are offering full aerial support using taxpayer 's $ $ $ while regular Joe is barely making ends meet , has inadequate Medicare , and ca n't send kids to college .
I suppose this has more to do with the Euro\/US debt that Gadaffi was about to call in , then ` ` human rights '' and similar bs US is serving the world .
If US is concerned about human rights -- they should swing by Ivory Coast , there 's more blood on the streets over there than in Iraq and Libya together . .

Libya has been accused of having committed numerous acts of terrorism in the past , but many of these have been perpetrated by foreign intelligence agencies as false flag operations -- the Lockerbie bombing being a prime example .
The report represents a severe blow to the attempts by Washington and its NATO allies , backed by the overwhelming majority of the Western media , to dismiss the Libyan government s claims of civilian casualties as propaganda and portray the continuous air raids as a humanitarian defense of the population .
The so - called humanitarian air raids have taken the lives of dozens of civilians in various areas of Tripoli , Bishop Giovanni Innocenzo Martinelli , the Apostolic Vicar of Tripoli told Agenzia Fides , the Vatican news service .

One of the most flimsy excuse for this inglorious rebel retreat offered by the Cameron - Obama - Sarkozy coalition , echoed by the mass media , is that their Libyan clients are outgunned -LRB-
Financial Times , 3\/29\/11 -RRB- .

Obviously Obama and company don t count the scores of jets , dozens of warships and submarines , the hundreds of daily attacks and the thousands of bombs dropped on the Libyan government since the start of Western imperial intervention .
Direct military intervention of 20 major and minor foreign military powers , savaging the sovereign Libyan state , as well as scores of political accomplices in the United Nations do not contribute to any military advantage for the imperial clients according to the daily pro - rebel propaganda . '

Reply unsoundness , what madness are you talkking about ?
do you mean this : How was Libya doing under the rule of Gadaffi ?
How bad did the people have it ?
Were they oppressed as we <TIMEX3 tid="t1529" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> commonly accept as fact ?
Let us look at the facts for a moment .
Before the chaos erupted , Libya had a lower incarceration rate than the Czech republic .
Libya had the lowest infant mortality rate of all of Africa .
Libya had the highest life expectancy of all of Africa .
Less than 5 % of the population was undernourished .
In response to the rising food prices around the world , the government of Libya abolished ALL taxes on food .
People in Libya were rich .
Libya had the highest gross domestic product -LRB- GDP -RRB- at purchasing power parity -LRB-
PPP -RRB- per capita of all of Africa .
The government took care to ensure that everyone in the country shared in the wealth .
Libya had the highest Human Development Index of any country on the continent .
The wealth was distributed equally .
In Libya , a lower percentage of people lived below the poverty line than in the Netherlands .
How does Libya get so rich ?
The answer is oil .
The country has a lot of oil , and does not allow foreign corporations to steal the resources while the population starves , unlike countries like Nigeria , a country that is basically run by Shell .

Reply If not to prevent genocide , grab the oil or promote democracy -LRB- via Patriot missiles -RRB- , what then is the driving force behind the Euro - US imperial intervention ?
A clue is in the selectivity of Western military intervention : In Bahrain , Saudi Arabia , Yemen , Jordan , Qatar and Oman ruling autocrats , allied with and backed by Euro - US imperial states go about arresting , torturing and murdering unarmed urban protestors with total impunity .
In Egypt and Tunisia , the US is backing a conservative junta of self - appointed civil - military elites in order to block the profound democratic and nationalist transformation of society demanded by the protesters .
The junta aims to push through neo - liberal economic reforms through carefully - vetted pro - Western elected officials .
While liberal critics may accuse the West of hypocrisy and double standards in bombing Gaddafi but not the Gulf butchers , in reality the imperial rulers consistently apply the same standards in each region : They defend strategic autocratic client regimes , which have allowed imperial states to build strategic air force and naval bases , run regional intelligence operations and set up logistical platforms for their ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as their future planned conflict with Iran .
They attack Gaddafi s Libya precisely because Gaddafi had refused to actively contribute to Western military operations in Africa and the Middle East .
The key point is that while Libya allows the biggest US - European multi - nationals to plunder its oil wealth , it did not become a strategic geo - political - military asset of the empire .
As we have written in many previous essays the driving force of US empire - building is military -- and not economic .
This is why billions of dollars of Western economic interests and contracts had been sacrificed in the setting up of sanctions against Iraq and Iran with the costly result that the invasion and occupation of Iraq shut down most oil exploitation for <TIMEX3 tid="t1544" type="DURATION" value="P1DE" mod="MORE_THAN">over a decade</TIMEX3> .
The Washington - led assault on Libya , with the majority of air sorties and missiles strikes being carried out by the Obama regime , is part of a more general counter - attack in response to the most <TIMEX3 tid="t1546" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> Arab popular pro - democracy movements .
The West is backing the suppression of these pro - democracy movements throughout the Gulf ; it finances the pro - imperial , pro - Israel junta in Egypt and it is intervening in Tunisia to ensure that any new regime is correctly aligned .
It supports a despotic regime in Algeria as well as Israel s daily assaults on Gaza .
In line with this policy , the West backs the uprising of ex - Gaddafites and right - wing monarchists , confident that the liberated Libya will once again provide military bases for the US - European military empire - builders .

These and more besides so - called rebels killing hundreds on the ground , targeting anyone thought to be pro - Gaddafi , including African guest workers there for employment , not political allegiance .

Reply what gives me the right ?
education : How was Libya doing under the rule of Gadaffi ?
How bad did the people have it ?
Were they oppressed as we <TIMEX3 tid="t1717" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> commonly accept as fact ?
Let us look at the facts for a moment .
Before the chaos erupted , Libya had a lower incarceration rate than the Czech republic .
Libya had the lowest infant mortality rate of all of Africa .
Libya had the highest life expectancy of all of Africa .
Less than 5 % of the population was undernourished .
In response to the rising food prices around the world , the government of Libya abolished ALL taxes on food .
People in Libya were rich .
Libya had the highest gross domestic product -LRB- GDP -RRB- at purchasing power parity -LRB-
PPP -RRB- per capita of all of Africa .
The government took care to ensure that everyone in the country shared in the wealth .
Libya had the highest Human Development Index of any country on the continent .
The wealth was distributed equally .
In Libya , a lower percentage of people lived below the poverty line than in the Netherlands .
How does Libya get so rich ?
The answer is oil .
The country has a lot of oil , and does not allow foreign corporations to steal the resources while the population starves , unlike countries like Nigeria , a country that is basically run by Shell .

The report represents a severe blow to the attempts by Washington and its NATO allies , backed by the overwhelming majority of the Western media , to dismiss the Libyan government s claims of civilian casualties as propaganda and portray the continuous air raids as a humanitarian defense of the population .
The so - called humanitarian air raids have taken the lives of dozens of civilians in various areas of Tripoli , Bishop Giovanni Innocenzo Martinelli , the Apostolic Vicar of Tripoli told Agenzia Fides , the Vatican news service .
Of particular concern , in the district of Buslim , a building collapsed because of the bombing killing 40 people , he said <TIMEX3 tid="t1734" type="DATE" value="2011-04-02">Yesterday</TIMEX3> I reported that the bombing had affected some hospitals , albeit indirectly .
I can <TIMEX3 tid="t1735" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> confirm that one of these hospitals is in Misda , a town about 110 miles south of Tripoli .

Despite this , we all believe that it is Russia as successor to the USSR , which is our SOLE safeguard for the interests of our countries and the security of our citizens .
Therefore , we appeal to you for help and justice .
<TIMEX3 tid="t1741" type="DATE" value="2011-04-03">Today</TIMEX3> , there is blatant external aggression of USA and NATO against a sovereign country Libya .
And if anyone can doubt this , then we say this obvious fact is well known , because all this is happening before our eyes , and the actions of U.S. and NATO threaten the lives of not only the citizens of Libya , but to us who are on its territory .
We are outraged by the barbaric bombing of Libya , which is <TIMEX3 tid="t1742" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> carried out by a coalition of U.S. and NATO .
The bombing of Tripoli and other cities in Libya is aimed not only at the objects of air defense and Libya s Air Force and not only against the Libyan army , but also the object of military and civilian infrastructure .
<TIMEX3 tid="t1747" type="DATE" value="2011-04-03">Today</TIMEX3> , <TIMEX3 tid="t1745" type="DATE" value="2011-03-24">24 March 2011</TIMEX3> , NATO aircraft and the U.S. all night and all morning bombed a suburb of Tripoli Tajhura -LRB- where , in particular , is Libya s Nuclear Research Center -RRB- .
Air Defense and Air Force facilities in Tajhura were destroyed back in the first <TIMEX3 tid="t1751" type="DURATION" value="P2D">2 days</TIMEX3> of strikes and more active military facilities in the city remained , but <TIMEX3 tid="t1749" type="DATE" value="2011-04-03">today</TIMEX3> the object of bombing are barracks of the Libyan army , around which are densely populated residential areas , and next to it the largest in Libya s Heart Centers .
Civilians and the doctors could not assume that common residential quarters will be about to become destroyed , so none of the residents or hospital patients was evacuated .
Bombs and rockets struck residential houses and fell near the hospital .
The glass of the Cardiac Center building was broken , and in the building of the maternity ward for pregnant women with heart disease a wall collapsed and part of the roof .
This resulted in ten miscarriages whereby babies died , the women are in intensive care , doctors are fighting for their lives .
Our colleagues and we are working <TIMEX3 tid="t1753" type="DURATION" value="P7D">seven days</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t1754" type="DURATION" value="P1W">a week</TIMEX3> , to save people .
This is a direct consequence of falling bombs and missiles in residential buildings resulting in dozens of deaths and injuries , which are operated and reviewed <TIMEX3 tid="t1755" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> by our doctors .
Such a large number of wounded and killed , as during <TIMEX3 tid="t1756" type="DATE" value="2011-04-03">today</TIMEX3> , did not result during the total of all the riots in Libya .
And this is called protecting the civilian population ?
With full responsibility as witnesses and participants of what is happening , we state that the United States and its allies are thus carrying out genocide against the Libyan people as was the case in Yugoslavia , Afghanistan and Iraq .
Crimes against humanity , carried out by coalition forces akin to those crimes committed by the fathers and grandfathers of <TIMEX3 tid="t1757" type="DATE" value="2011-04-03">today</TIMEX3> s Western leaders and their henchmen in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan and in Dresden in Germany , where civilians were also being destroyed in order to deter , to break the will of the people to resist -LRB- Germany remembers it , and therefore refused to participate in this new slaughterhouse -RRB- .
<TIMEX3 tid="t1758" type="DATE" value="2011-04-03">Today</TIMEX3> they want in such ways to make the Libyan people surrender their leader and the legitimate government and meekly lay down their national oil wealth for the countries of the coalition .
We understand that applying to the international community to save the people of Libya and we were living in Libya , is useless .
Our only hope is Russia that has the right of veto in the UN , and specifically its leaders the President and the Prime Minister .
We still hope for you , as hoped in the past , when we took the decision to stay in Libya , and to help its people , medical duty playing its role in the first place .
After an abortive coup attempt in <TIMEX3 tid="t1760" type="DATE" value="2011-02" mod="END">late February</TIMEX3> , the situation calmed down in Libya and the government had successfully restored order .
To everyone in Libya , it was clear that without American intervention the country would soon return to normal life .
Convinced that Russia , which has veto power , would not allow the aggression of the United States and its allies , we decided to stay in Libya , but were mistaken : Russia , unfortunately , believed the false assurances of Americans and did not oppose the criminal decision of France and the U.S. US - NATO air strikes on Tripoli and other Libyan cities have claimed growing numbers of civilian victims , according to the Vatican s top representative in the Libyan capital .
The report represents a severe blow to the attempts by Washington and its NATO allies , backed by the overwhelming majority of the Western media , to dismiss the Libyan government s claims of civilian casualties as propaganda and portray the continuous air raids as a humanitarian defense of the population .
The so - called humanitarian air raids have taken the lives of dozens of civilians in various areas of Tripoli , Bishop Giovanni Innocenzo Martinelli , the Apostolic Vicar of Tripoli told Agenzia Fides , the Vatican news service .
Of particular concern , in the district of Buslim , a building collapsed because of the bombing killing 40 people , he said <TIMEX3 tid="t1761" type="DATE" value="2011-04-02">Yesterday</TIMEX3> I reported that the bombing had affected some hospitals , albeit indirectly .
I can <TIMEX3 tid="t1762" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> confirm that one of these hospitals is in Misda , a town about 110 miles south of Tripoli .
The Euronews television channel reported that a bombing raid on an ammunition dump in Misda had caused damage to the hospital and nearby homes , wounding at least 13 civilians .
In an interview with Euronews , Bishop Martinelli said that the scores of casualties had been confirmed to me by people who have lost loved ones because of these bombings .
He cited another incident in which an air strike hit a munitions warehouse located in close proximity to a civilian neighborhood .
This building was exploding for three , <TIMEX3 tid="t1763" type="DURATION" value="PT4H">four hours</TIMEX3> , he said , claiming more victims .
If it is true that the bombings appear to be very targeted , Martrinelli told the Fides news agency , it is also true that they are hitting military targets which are in the midst of civilian neighborhoods , thus the local people are also affected .
The bishop added : The situation in Tripoli is becoming more difficult <TIMEX3 tid="t1764" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EVERY">every day</TIMEX3> .
The fuel shortage has worsened , as evidenced by the queues of cars at petrol stations .
Describing the military conflict as an impasse , he urged a diplomatic solution to end the bloodshed between Libyans , giving Gaddafi a dignified way out .
NATO , which formally assumed command of the US - led war against Libya <TIMEX3 tid="t1765" type="DATE" value="2011-03-31">Thursday</TIMEX3> , said it was investigating the reported casualties .
Lt . Gen. Charles Bouchard , the Canadian officer heading the NATO command in Libya , described the bishop s account as a news report and insisted that NATO was operating under very strict rules of engagement and within the legal mandate of our United Nations mandate .
Echoing similar statements issued by the NATO command in response to the continuous killing of civilians in Afghanistan , he added , I appreciate the source of this report , but it is worth noting that I take every one of those issues seriously .
In a separate incident , the Associated Press interviewed the family of an 18 - month - old toddler , Sirajuddin al - Sweisi , who was killed when an ammunition dump near their home in the village of Khorum , about 55 miles south of Tripoli , was attacked by US - NATO warplanes .
The young boy s mother said that their house was rocked by the blast at about six in the morning , with debris piercing the wall of the family s home .
She found her son , who was sleeping , with a piece of hot metal embedded into the side of his face .
His blood was streaming down my arm , she said weeping .
He was crying out , Mama , Mama , reaching out with his hand to me .
The family rushed him to the hospital where he was treated for burns and broken bones , but he died the same night .
Neighbors said that the explosions caused by the air raid injured a number of other people and damaged houses in the area .
Washington and its allies have claimed legitimacy for their imperialist assault on Libya by invoking United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 , which authorizes all necessary measures to protect civilians from attack .
It has become increasingly evident that these measures include the slaughter of the very civilians that are supposedly being protected .

Yet the demonisation of Gaddafi is priority number one for the embedded media , including Al - Jazeera .
In reality , Libya is a good example of a welfare state .
Gaddafi has not built huge palaces like the Gulf sheikhs have done with public money .
