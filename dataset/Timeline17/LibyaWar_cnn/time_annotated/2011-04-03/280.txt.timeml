By the CNN Wire Staff Coalition airstrikes hit several rebel vehicles , reports say A government spokesman says the rebels are not serious about a cease - fire An opposition leader calls for the removal of snipers , mercenaries and militias Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Notions of a cease - fire in Libya quickly faded <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2011-04-02">Saturday</TIMEX3> as a battle raged for control of the oil town of al - Brega , where rebel fighters claimed they had lost fighters and vehicles to NATO airstrikes .
Airstrikes hit several rebel vehicles and killed at least 13 rebel fighters , spokesmen for the Libyan opposition said <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-04-02">Saturday</TIMEX3> .
Seven others were wounded .
NATO was investigating the incident , a spokeswoman said <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2011-04-02">Saturday</TIMEX3> .
` ` NATO takes any reports of civilian casualties very seriously , but exact details are hard to verify as we have no reliable sources on the ground , '' NATO 's Oana Lungescu said .
` ` Clearly , if someone fires at one of our aircraft , of course they have the right to defend themselves . ''
Rebel spokesman Abdul Hafiz Ghoga said opposition fighters had retaken al - Brega after a night of heavy fighting with Moammar Gadhafi 's forces .
But it was not immediately clear who commanded control <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2011-04-02">Saturday</TIMEX3> of the coastal city that has <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> changed hands six times in as <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="PXW">many weeks</TIMEX3> under the dramatically shifting circumstances of the Libyan war .
Meanwhile , in Misrata , east of Tripoli , two mortars landed at a medical clinic <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="TIME" value="2011-04-02TEV">Saturday evening</TIMEX3> , causing one death and numerous injuries , said a medical official with the city 's main hospital .
The doctor , who was not identified for security reasons , told CNN the clinic that was attacked had evacuated patients because of <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> attacks , but was being guarded by opposition ` ` fighters and young people . ''
One person was killed and 15 injured , said the doctor , who was caring for the wounded .
Five had serious injuries , including head and chest trauma , he said .
Forces loyal to Gadhafi showed no signs of backing down after officials spurned an opposition cease - fire proposal .
Government spokesman Musa Ibrahim told reporters in Tripoli on <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2011-04-01">Friday</TIMEX3> that rebels were not ` ` really serious '' about the offer , which he said included ` ` silly conditions . ''
` ` They are asking us to withdraw from our own cities and open our cities to people , who are holding up arms , who are tribal , violent , no unified leadership , al Qaeda links , and no one knows who they are .
If this is not mad , then I do n't know what it is , '' he said .
` ` We will not leave our cities .
We will not stop protecting our civilians . ''
His comments came after Libyan opposition leader Mustafa Abdul Jalil laid out cease - fire conditions that included freedom of expression for the Libyan people and the removal of snipers , mercenaries and militias from western cities .
Ultimately , he said , the opposition 's goal remains regime change in Libya .
Ghoga sought to clarify the opposition 's position <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2011-04-02">Saturday</TIMEX3> .
` ` There is no , and was no , negotiation on a cease - fire with Colonel Gaddafi 's dictatorship , '' he said at a Bengahzi news conference .
He repeated the opposition demands that Gadhafi halt all military action , end the sieges laid on cities like Misrata and allow free speech and assembly .
Sources close to Gadhafi told CNN that political solutions are still possible but that the Libyan leader would relinquish power only to others within his inner circle .
They said there is still time for dialogue but expressed doubts about who would represent the opposition .
Any transition , they said , would involve Gadhafi 's second son , Saif al - Islam Gadhafi , and for such a transition to take place there would first have to be an end to the fighting .
The Libyan sources told CNN that for <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> , Gadhafi remains confident the regime can withstand any challenge from the rebels .
U.S. officials claim Gadhafi 's military capabilities have been steadily eroded since the onset of U.N.-sanctioned airstrikes .
The dictator 's forces , however , still outnumber rebels by about 10 to 1 in terms of armor and other ground forces , according to Navy Adm. Mike Mullen , the Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman .
