CNN -RRB- --
Libya 's rebel leader says he does not have a problem with Moammar Gadhafi remaining in the country , once he resigns and as long as he remains under supervision , according to a television report .
Mustafa Abdel Jalil contradicted earlier opposition statements that Gadhafi 's exit from the country was an absolute prerequisite to bring about the end of the months - long conflict .
It signaled a possible willingness to negotiate with the Libyan leader to bring about an end to the fighting .
In a Reuters Television report <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2011-07-03">Sunday</TIMEX3> , Jalil made the comments while reacting to a proposal put forward by the African Union , which rebels have interpreted to mean Gadhafi should have no further role in the country 's leadership .
Jalil told Reuters once Gadhafi resigns , ` ` At that point he can decide if he would stay in Libya or abroad . ''
` ` If he desires to stay in Libya , we will be the ones to determine the place and there will be international supervision on all his movements and communications , '' he said during an interview in the rebel stronghold of Benghazi .

Daughter : Gadhafi is ` symbol , guide ' Donilon : No decision on arming Libya Jalil took the reins of the rebel movements after resigning from Gadhafi 's government in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-02">February</TIMEX3> over what he saw as excessive use of force against demonstrators calling for the leader 's resignation .
Libyan government spokesman Musa Ibrahim has previously said the prospect of a peace deal would be welcomed , but not one that rested on Gadhafi 's departure .
Libya 's Deputy Foreign Minister , Khaled Kaim , noted <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2011-07-04">Monday</TIMEX3> that talks between government officials and rebel leaders are continuing on multiple levels , including daily phone conversations .
He expressed optimism that the talks could have a positive outcome if NATO 's air campaign is halted .
Kaim said Italian officials had granted travel visas to certain individuals to help facilitate the talks outside of Libya .
But Maurizio Massari , a spokesman for the Italian foreign ministry , denied Kaim 's assertion .
The fighting in Libya , meanwhile , was slated to take center stage <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-07-04">Monday</TIMEX3> at a meeting between NATO nations and Russia .
The meeting brought together countries who support the airstrikes targeting Gadhafi 's forces and one of the biggest critics of the bombing campaign .
NATO Secretary - General Anders Fogh Rasmussen was scheduled to meet with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev as part of the Russia - NATO Council meeting in Russia 's Black Sea resort town of Sochi , Russia 's state - run RIA Novosti news agency reported , citing the Kremlin .
` ` The sole possibility of stabilizing the situation in Libya is an immediate cease - fire and the start of talks between the internal Libyan participants in the conflict with the support of , but not interference from , outside , '' the Kremlin said , according to RIA Novosti .
Russia has been a critic of the NATO bombing campaign that began in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2011-03">March</TIMEX3> after the U.N. Security Council approved a resolution for the use of force , with the exception of a ground invasion , to protect civilians .
Russia , a member of the Security Council , abstained from the vote .
` ` Special responsibility in the search for a political - diplomatic solution to the crisis lies with regional organizations , above all the African Union , and the UN secretary general 's special envoy , '' the Kremlin said , according to the news report .
The meeting followed reports <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011-07-03">Sunday</TIMEX3> of fierce fighting in western Libya , where Gadhafi 's forces have been shelling the towns of Yefren and Kikla , east of the rebel stronghold of Zintan .
The shelling began <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2011-07-01">three days ago</TIMEX3> , according to Mazigh Buzakhar , who works for an opposition media group .
Buzakhar said clashes in the western Nafusa mountains on <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2011-07-03">Sunday</TIMEX3> killed two rebel fighters and wounded 11 .
CNN can not independently confirm Buzakhar 's account .
Conditions in the embattled towns in the Nafusa mountains are bleak , with no electricity and a shortage of water , Buzakhar said .
Rebels have been battling Gadhafi 's forces for months in an attempt to bring about an end to the Libyan leader 's 42 - year rule .
The rebels received a financial boost <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2011-07-03">Sunday</TIMEX3> when Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu pledged $ 200 million in support to the opposition .
Davutoglu made the pledge during a meeting with Jalil in Benghazi , the foreign ministry said .
The Foreign Ministry told CNN <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2011-07-04">Monday</TIMEX3> that Turkey recognizes the opposition in Libya as legitimate representatives of the country , however , it does not mean the rebels are recognized as the sole representatives .
Turkey has not cut off its diplomatic relations with Gadhafi 's government , the ministry said .
Gadhafi has been under international pressure to step down , and the International Criminal Court at The Hague issued a warrant for his arrest as well as for the arrest of his son , Saif al - Islam Gadhafi and his brother - in - law Abdullah al - Sanussi .
The warrants are ` ` for crimes against humanity , '' including murder and persecution , ` ` allegedly committed across Libya '' from <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2011-02-15">February 15</TIMEX3> through ` ` at least '' <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2011-02-28">February 28</TIMEX3> , the court said in a statement .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2011-07-03">Sunday</TIMEX3> , South African President Jacob Zuma traveled to Russia to discuss efforts to end the fighting in Libya , just days after he and other members of the African Union said they would not cooperate with the International Criminal Court 's arrest warrant for Moammar Gadhafi .
Zuma and others were attending a meeting of the International Contact Group on Libya -- a group of NATO countries , Arab nations and other countries working to bring about an end to the months - long conflict .
The African Union said its members will not cooperate with the ICC 's arrest warrant for Gadhafi , arguing that the measure jeopardizes efforts to negotiate a peace deal in the war - torn nation .
The arrest warrant ` ` seriously complicates the efforts aimed at finding a negotiated political solution to the crisis in Libya , '' said a statement summarizing the countries ' decision at a summit in Equatorial Guinea that ended <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2011-07-01">Friday</TIMEX3> .
Libya is not a signatory to the Rome Statute , which established the international court 's authority , and the court does not have the power to enter Libya and arrest the leaders .
Gadhafi has made clear he would not recognize the court 's authority .
