-LRB- CNN -RRB- --
It is a bitter irony that Chris Hondros , the prize - winning photographer killed in Libya on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-04-20">Wednesday</TIMEX3> alongside Oscar - nominated photojournalist Tim Hetherington , was to due to speak in New York <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2011-W17">next week</TIMEX3> on the dangers of covering conflict .
I felt honored to be invited to sit on the same panel as him at the International Center of Photography , with other veteran battlefield photographers and their editors .
The question for the panelists was essentially , ` ` Covering conflict : Is it worth it ? ''
Each generation of journalists finds its own answers to that deceptively simple question .
Advances in picture and audio technology , coupled with warp - speed mobile communications , have transformed newsgathering .
But the essentials of sketching out the first draft of history , whether in words or in images , are the same .
The only way to capture the truth is to get close to it .
Despite powerful telephoto lenses , conflict photographers still work much like Robert Capa , who used a simple Contax camera to capture the Spanish Civil War in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="193">the 1930s</TIMEX3> .
Hetherington and Hondros , who won the Robert Capa Gold Medal for his work in Iraq , understood the catalyzing power of the still image .
Their work freezes the flow of blood or tears on a human face , rendering the real cost of fighting in Afghanistan , the Middle East , Africa and the Balkans .
They knew that a single image , like the napalmed Vietnamese girl running from her burning village , can crystallize a whole war .
Their work freezes the flow of blood or tears on a human face , rendering the real cost of fighting .
That is why they were in the thick of bullets and mortar bombs in Misrata .
<TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> , unfortunately , they join a tragically high honor roll of journalists who have given their lives to bear witness .
The Committee to Protect Journalists has documented the deaths of 861 journalists <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P2DE" mod="MORE_THAN">over the past two decades</TIMEX3> .
In that period , 150 have been killed directly in combat .
Of those , about half were photojournalists or camera operators .
<TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010">Last year</TIMEX3> , 40 % of journalists who died in the line of duty were killed in combat - related crossfire and in dangerous assignments such as street protests .
And <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2011">this year</TIMEX3> , because of the uprisings in the Middle East , 12 of the 16 journalists killed worldwide have died covering combat or on dangerous assignments .
Libya , with four combat deaths and brutal detentions of journalists , is especially dangerous for the press .
The fighting is chaotic , with fluid or nonexistent front lines .
Irregulars , soldiers without uniforms , pro - Gadhafi forces moving among civilians and firing into populated urban areas , all make for a deadly maze through which unprotected journalists must thread a path .
Unlike the U.S.-prosecuted wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , journalists in Libya are not embedded with any military .
Hetherington and Hondros had worked as both ` ` embeds '' and unilaterals , the military jargon for those journalists who go it alone .
It was extremely difficult , if not impossible , to cover the fighting in both U.S. theaters without the army .
Hetherington turned this to his advantage brilliantly by co - directing the <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3> Oscar - nominated ''
Restrepo , '' a film <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P1Y" mod="APPROX">about a year</TIMEX3> spent on a forward operating base in Afghanistan with U.S. troops .
Libya , with four combat deaths and brutal detentions of journalists , is especially dangerous for the press .
Hetherington and Hondros knew from training and experience how to handle themselves in combat .
As a photojournalist , you learn where to stand to shoot , what to wear , how to approach combatants , how to hire a driver , a fixer , an interpreter , how to choose a hotel , and on and on .
Any journalist may wear a bulletproof vest and a helmet .
But in the end , reporters are exposed .
Mortar rounds and rocket - propelled grenades like those whizzing through the streets of Misrata are no respecters of Kevlar chest plates .
Hetherington and Hondros were not alone .
Two other colleagues with them on the street were wounded in the same attack .
To the east , still other photographers and reporters are missing or in detention , grabbed by pro - Tripoli forces .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="P8W">the eight weeks</TIMEX3> since this civil war erupted , the Committee to Protect Journalists has documented more than 80 attacks on the press , including the killing of a cameraman for Al - Jazeera and reporter for Libya Al - Hurra TV .
As of <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2011-04-21">today</TIMEX3> , 17 journalists are missing or in detention , among them three photojournalists : Spaniard Manuel Varela , European Pressphoto Agency ; South African Anton Hammerl , Christian Science Monitor ; and American James Foley , Global Post .
We never will get to hear Chris Hondros ' thoughts on covering war <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2011-W17">next week</TIMEX3> at the International Center of Photography .
He already gave his answer by venturing onto Tripoli Street in Misrata with his camera .
