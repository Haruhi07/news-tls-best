By David Gergen , CNN Senior Political Analyst David Gergen : Washington is pondering Obama 's ` ` head - snapping '' shift on Libya
He says Hillary Clinton , Susan Rice , Samantha Power pushed for the change Gergen : Can U.S. oppose Libya repression while going easy on Bahrain , Saudis ?
He says most observers feel that what Obama wants is still the big question mark in D.C.

Cambridge , Massachusetts -LRB- CNN -RRB- --
After conversations with top players in Washington <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2011-W11">last week</TIMEX3> , mostly as I accompanied a group of Zuckerman Fellows from Harvard on a field trip , here are some brief reflections on the mood there toward events in the Middle East :
The head - snapping change in policy toward Libya has everyone guessing where the Mideast is heading , whether the U.S. has a good handle , and most of all , what President Obama is trying to achieve .
One irony , as a female friend put it , is that for years many of us believed that if only more women could gain power , the world would surely become more peaceful .

Yet , we <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> see that the three people who talked Obama into using force against Libya 's Moammar Gadhafi were all women -- Hillary Clinton , Susan Rice and Samantha Power .
Leading male advisers were opposed .
Perhaps we should be less surprised than we are .
And remember , too , that both were seen as successful leaders for most of their time in office .
There are divisions in Washington about the president 's actions , but most -- including me -- believe Hillary & Co. had the better argument .
If anything , the U.S. delayed too long , allowing Gadhafi to gain the upper hand on the ground .
The head - snapping change in policy toward Libya has everyone guessing ...
what President Obama is trying to achieve .
Clinton 's voice key on Libyan policy Obama : No ground troops in Libya But what is the president 's endgame in Libya ?
And what is his strategy for the Middle East more generally ?
Who can say for sure ?
Originally , the president kept saying we want Gadhafi out -- but <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> that we are using force , he says we only want to stop him from killing more civilians .
Is this mission creep in reverse ?

And how tough would we be if , as seemed possible <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-03-21">today</TIMEX3> , the Arab League begins to retreat from supporting force ?
Meanwhile , the administration privately -- and rightly -- stresses that even as we hit Libya , we must keep a strategic focus on Egypt and Saudi Arabia , long seen as our most powerful Arab friends in the region .
The preliminary returns from weekend voting in Egypt -- we are still waiting to hear from Cairo -- will bring some heartburn in Washington .
How big a threat will the Muslim Brotherhood <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> become in elections <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="PXM">a few months</TIMEX3> from <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> and what can Washington do about it ?
Even bigger headaches are arising in the U.S.-Saudi relationship .
Several top players from past administrations report that the Saudis are hugely angry about Obama 's treatment of Egypt 's ex - President Hosni Mubarak .
` ` He was your best friend in the region for <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P30Y" mod="MORE_THAN">more than 30 years</TIMEX3> , doing everything you asked , '' the Saudi argument goes , ` ` but <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P1W">a week</TIMEX3> after he got into trouble , you threw him under the bus rather than working out a graceful exit .
How can we <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> trust you ? ''
The Obama administration is <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> working to rebuild Saudi ties , but will it have sufficient leverage to help usher in more democratic reforms in the kingdom and , crucially at the moment , in nearby Bahrain and Yemen ?
Or , as seems likely , will we be caught in increasing contradictions between our policy in Libya -LRB- crack down on an enemy government that kills demonstrators -RRB- vs. Bahrain and Yemen -LRB- go easy on a friendly government that kills demonstrators
-RRB- ?

The big question mark is the president himself .
Rebounding from his electoral defeats <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2010-11">last November</TIMEX3> , he seemed to be asserting a much firmer grasp on power , but in <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent weeks</TIMEX3> , he appears to outsiders as someone who has slipped back into a haze of caution .
The Economist <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2011-W12">this week</TIMEX3> is even questioning his political courage .
As he sends U.S. troops into harm 's way , many in Washington are <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> waiting to see which Obama <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> emerges .
Much rides on the outcome .
