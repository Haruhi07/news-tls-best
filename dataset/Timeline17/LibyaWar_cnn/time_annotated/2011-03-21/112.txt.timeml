Russia Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said the intervention reminded him of the medieval call for crusades :
In Bill Clinton s times they bombed Yugoslavia and Belgrade , Bush sent troops to Afghanistan and then , under a made - up and absolutely false excuse they sent troops to Iraq , liquidated all Iraqi authorities , even children from Saddam Hussein s family were killed .
<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> its Libya s turn .
They use protection of civilians as an excuse .
But it is the civilian population who perish in air raids .
So where is the logic and conscience ?
There is none of both .
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev broke publically with Putin on this - a very rare event -- saying of Putin s remarks , ` ` Under no circumstances is it acceptable to use expressions which essentially lead to a clash of civilizations .
` ` The blood - soaked tempests that Iraq has undergone for <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P8Y">eight years</TIMEX3> and the unspeakable suffering of its people are a mirror and a warning .
The military attacks on Libya are , following on the Afghan and Iraq wars , the third time that some countries have launched armed action against sovereign countries .
It should be seen that every time military means are used to address crises , that is a blow to the United Nations Charter and the rules of international relations .
In its argument , the newspaper said military actions will add to the domestic chaos in Libya and possibly strengthen Gadhafi .
Furthermore , it argued that Libya may descend into anarchy as a loosely connected tribal society .
The external affairs minister of India , S M Krishna , told reporters : We view with grave concern the ongoing violence , strikes and deteriorating humanitarian situation in Libya .
We regret the air strikes that are taking place ...
India calls upon all parties to abjure violence and the use of threat and force to resolve the differences .
I think the need of the hour is cessation of armed conflict .
Meanwhile , the African Union has called for an end to all military actions in Libya .
Mauritania President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz , whose country is hosting the union s summit <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3> , added that the African Union rejects the idea of foreign military intervention in Libya , regardless of its form .
The fact that we know so little about the domestic context among non - regime actors in Libya is precisely the reason that the types of external intervention <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> taking place are likely to backfire .
On Libyan news site Jeel - Libya , Salem Ben Ammar writes approvingly of international intervention , calling this the beginning of the countdown to the end of the cowardly tyrant Gadhafi .
Also supporting the intervention is the London Evening Standard .
In an editorial , it writes : The air strikes against Libyan government targets have had one good outcome : the rebel stronghold of Benghazi did not fall , as it would otherwise have done , and the inevitable massacre of rebels did not take place .
France Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said : The initial success of our intervention is clear .
If we had done nothing , Benghazi would be a bloodbath .
We saved the civilians of Benghazi .
Greg Sheridan of The Australian writes : Even if this results in a prolonged stalemate it is much better than outright victory for Gaddafi .
And in fact the precedents are not too bad .
For <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P1DE" mod="LESS_THAN">nearly a decade</TIMEX3> the U.S. and its allies enforced a no - fly zone against Saddam Hussein 's forces over the Kurdish areas of northern Iraq .
The de facto state that developed there was liberal and well run by Middle Eastern standards and has been central to the democratic dialogue in post - Saddam Iraq .
In the United States , Washington Post columnist David Ignatius compliments the Obama administration s handling of the intervention in Libya : President Obama is turning a page , by letting other nations take the first whacks at Moammar Gaddafi , no question about that .
But that strikes me as good strategy , not a feckless blunder .
What s increasingly clear watching the play of events over <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2011-W11">the past week</TIMEX3> is that Obama really does want to change the narrative about America and the Arab world even at the cost of being criticized as vacillating and weak - willed .
He senses -LRB- rightly , in my view -RRB- that <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="PXDE" mod="MORE_THAN">over the past several decades</TIMEX3> America , without really intending to , became a post - colonial power in the Middle East .
The narrative of American military intervention stretches from Lebanon to Iraq to Afghanistan , with the ghastly interlude of <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2001-09-11">Sept. 11 , 2001</TIMEX3> .
Obama seems determined to break with it .
He really is the un - Bush .
In Germany , foreign minister Guido Westerwelle said : It is the responsibility of every country to decide if they 'll support a military intervention or not .
We always said we would n't send soldiers .
This does not mean we are neutral , this does not mean that we have any sympathy with the dictator -LRB- Muammar -RRB- Qaddafi .
-LRB-
But -RRB- we calculated the risks , and when we see that <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="P3D">three days</TIMEX3> after this intervention began , the Arab League has already criticised this intervention , I think we see we had good reasons .
Germans reflect this ambivalence .
A survey in the Bild am Sonntag newspaper found that 62 % of respondents supported international intervention , while 31 % were against it .
Despite their support for international intervention , the majority of Germans did not want their country involved .
German pundits worry that this stance will hurt Germany 's global standing .
Amrit Naresh of The Local newspaper writes : Did we isolate ourselves ?
In a way , yes .
Did we damage our room to maneuver ?
We have lost a little bit of credibility in the Security Council , I believe , with this cautiousness .
Amr Moussa , secretary - general of the Arab League , stepped back from his earlier criticism of airstrikes and said the Arab League and the U.N. Security Council are united on the need to protect civilians .
Another Arab League official , however , said saving Libya from Moammar Gadhafi 's forces was ` ` an Arab and nationalist duty '' above all , and warned that the situation in the North African state was ` ` very dangerous . ''
Who do you agree with ?
I agree with the opponents .
This aggression is absolutely unacceptable .
<TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> Gaddafis military bases are destroyed , so what 's next ?

The Rebels will be armed and have the upper hand ?
Those loyal to the regime ca n't fight back and have to surrender unconditionally .
Will there be peace in the country ?
Do we outsiders know whether we are doing the right thing , when we rule in favor or against one of the two warring parties .

Were you there defending the Libyan people from murder , torture and persecution for <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DURATION" value="P41Y">the last 41 years</TIMEX3> ?
Did n't think so .
The only ` ` just '' solution would be if every tree in Libya was adorned with a hung Gadaffi supporter .
After all the years of atrocities commited by his regime the opposition deserves a ` ` JUST '' revenge and I hope they get it .

Israel continues to terrorize Palestinians with Tomahawk 's and F15 's , tanks , and modern weapons of terror .
While the Palestinians are armed with sticks and stone and absolute determination to recover some of their Nation stolen by the Euro - Jews , the Kazars .

Let 's put it in prospective .
When people are fighting for freedom and liberty from tyrants like Mr. Kaddafi , we should not be ashamed , fearful , or scared of confronting ` ` evil '' .
Like some typical neighborhoods , if everyone accept thugs to run around rampant , doing what ever they want , and causing you to live in fear and in your home with bars , or even worse , pretend you do n't see it and agree with them -- what type of life is that ?
Only dogs and animals ready to be killed live like that .
When an entire neighborhood stands up for their rights , we should stand with them -LRB- and not on the sidelines waiting to see where the wind blows -RRB- .
So many people are fearful of taking the right action , in standing by the right thing to do .
Ask yourself , what is the right thing to do when you see a tyrant , dictator going after his own people ?
You stand up like a real man , a ` ` human '' and go against them .
If I were in Libya , I would be right across from Kaddafi 's home , ready to blast him out to kingdom come .
Let the free people of Libya finally achieve their aspirations and dreams of freedom , liberty and happiness -LRB-
yes the principles of the US Constitution which we in America live and die for -- not sit around and wait for others to defend us -RRB- .

Oh and the civilians I keep forgetting them civilians .

I think this so called UN resolution 1973 for intervention in libya is unacceptable and it is all about west hungry thirst of LIBYA
OIL
that 's it .
USA , UK and FRANCE are hypocrat and playing double standard in libyan internal conflict because looking at IVORY COAST conflict whereby thousands and thousands of innocent civilians are being killing by the president who lost <TIMEX3 tid="t72" type="DATE" value="2010">last year</TIMEX3> election but refused to cede and as many as 700000 displace people .
What did USA , UK , and FRANCE do about that ?
The answer is clear NO . .
Because there is no OIL in Ivory Coast .
Did they intervene in Darfur , Sudan ?
Do n't judge me wrong i have never like Qaddafi before and i will never like him but what west is doing in his country is criminal act and they will be revenge by Qaddafi 's sympathizers around the world in <TIMEX3 tid="t73" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">coming months</TIMEX3> or years to those international countries who attack him with their bombs .

The same Putin who 's invaded Georgia , stolen big chunks of it 's territory , who 's a former graduate of the most vicious terrorist organization , the KGB , who likes to kill off his opponents with plutonium , or to simply make them disappear .
Those who are ` ` lucky '' find themselves charged with trumped up charges and thrown into a prison .
Journalists who 're critical of him simply die off .
Putin is a Russian thug president and the only reason he 's speaking out is because he fears a regime change in Libya might lead to lower oil prices .
It wo n't , but it only shows his ignorance .

Regardless of how the Libyan situation turns out , this was the right thing to do .
Putin is a born again ex - KGB who would love the old days to return .
He is no one to criticise the coalition .
For the first time in years , a lot of people in my circle express their approval of the intervention , the US has gone up in our estimate for what it is worth and your president deserves respect for the way he has handled the situation .
I ca n't believe the criticism that is being directed at him .
He is doing his best to restore America 's credibility in the world and is not doing a bad job at all .
I think it is incredible that the educated young people of the Arab world have finally woken up and realized that their enemy is not the west but they have home made enemies who lust for power and will do anything to cling to it .
Well done to the US and international coalition including the pusillanimous Arab League !

The smug glee is shameful the contradictions so vulgar and the murderous intent so self righteous and so self self serving .
The news channels a cross the world also seem to sensationalize , their reporters seem subjective with selective hearing and do n't let the facts get in the way of a closed mind or self fulfilling prophecy .
Since when does two wrongs make a right .
Is air support to the revolutionaries counter attacks establishing a cease fire or imposing a murderous will on others for ones own intent or beliefs .
Why are we not protecting civilians in Bahrain , Yemen , Syria or Saudi Arabia by enforcing a cease fire .
Why were we not asked to vote on this ?
Who gave Cameron\/Clegg the right to take us to war again in a self righteous crusade .

Fareed , let 's get one thing absolutely clear .
Protection of civilians is not the reason for the no fly zone and the military action .
If there is one thing the United Nations has proven it is that it can and will stand by when civilians are being killed .
I am surprised the Arab League did not call for a no fly zone to protect their ` brothers ' in Gaza .
Every person in the world , including those in remote tribal villages who has access to world news know two things : One : The United Nations will not always intervene to protect civilians Two : If there is intervention there are some other interests involved .
Those so called world leaders have not learned how to lie or handle their public relations .
Why should the Arab League choose to ask for protection of rebels -LRB- see Times article -RRB- -- sorry -- civilians in this country , Libya ?
Are they interested in establishing a totalitarian Muslim state ?
It seems to be so .

And there is the oill .
Black Gold it is called , perhaps I know why .
More precious is ` ` Red Gold '' the precious blood that runs in the veins of all of us who are human .
Red Gold is to be preserved at all costs , conserved at all costs , protected at all costs , and is priceless .

Well ... we Americans and Europeans turn our eyes when killings occurred in Rwanda and in the former Yugoslavia in the mid-90 's under the Clinton Administration .
And over 400,000 died of genocide .
We lived in guilt and agreed never to sand by when such actions occur in the future .
So we have decided to take a stand , and stand for humanity .

A stand where hopefully in the future , we will teach the future world generation that genocide and killing innocent people as a very good reason to use military force to save a population .
In fact , this is one good reason to use military force .
The future benefits and learnings will carry through for generations .
Finally , let it be known that the Arabs have taken head to President Obama when he travel to Egypt in <TIMEX3 tid="t213" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3> and gave a speech about Freedom and Democracy .
<TIMEX3 tid="t215" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">2 years</TIMEX3> latter , that Arab population is taking the call and rightfully so .
The journey is still long and hard ...
however , the Arab countries , after 30 - <TIMEX3 tid="t218" type="DURATION" value="P40Y">40 years</TIMEX3> of tyrants and dictatorship rule , was bound to have revolutions to overthrow their <TIMEX3 tid="t216" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> governments , and move more towards democratic rule .
As the Arab countries and world start to see the US as holding to
it 's principles of protecting the Libyan people who are struggling for their right to Freedom , Liberty and democracy , they will start to appreciate America for what it is -- a true democracy which stands by it 's principles -- Freedom , Liberty , the land of the brave .

Yes , I realize we have partners in all of our various conflicts , but we are always in the lead and we are always bearing the greatest cost , and for what ?
I guess we did n't learn anything from Iraq .
We went in , got Saddam out , then started taking fire from people who hated and opposed him , but feared him .
Why would we thing that Libya would be any different ?

Yeah ,
yeah ,
Ghadaffi fired on peaceful protesters .
How long did it take for those peaceful protesters to pick up weapons and fire back ?
Not long at all .
Makes you wonder how long it would have been before they were the ones who started shooting .

Hey , next we should give them money , or weapons , or both and see how long before those weapons are fired at us .

It is just too obvious that there is an unseen hand controlling events underground in the countries where revolution has become the other of the day .

The dictatorship of Ghadafi is deserved to be wiped out and all people of Libya would be free from fear , and any kind of suffering caused by this regime .
When there is no such a regime , the freedom and democracy would be improved .
What 's next after Ghadafi ?
I support the idea to construct Libya with a democracy , of which this country could accept and adapt it .
After Ghadafi , all foreign military forces should be withdrawn from Libya because Libya really do not need a neo - imperialist and neo - capitalist controlling their country .

So you support our military going in there and helping the rebels by bombing Ghadafi 's forces , but you think we want to control Libya ?
So we are spending billions of U.S. dollars doing this and that 's great in your book , but after Ghadafi is removed , you do nt want us around , right ?
Then we go back to being murderers and thieves in your mind ?
That is exactly why we should stay out of it and let them sort it out .
I really do nt care who kills who over there , its always going to be the same old story that you all think we want to steal your oil and whatever else it is that we supposedly do .
We should just take the money we are spending on helping these bastards and invest it in our own country .

We look back at what happened in Sudan and other countries where we did n't intervene , and we 're ashamed .
That we did n't step in earlier in Darfur is inexcusable .
<TIMEX3 tid="t424" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> we were given a chance to stop another insane dictator from going in and killing an entire portion of the population , and we took it .
Some people are upset because we sided with the rebels by acting .
But had we not , we would have passively watched a massacre on CNN , and the headline would have been , ` ` how many did n't have to ? ''
Leaving Libya alone would be the act of siding with Qaddafi .
We certainly should n't invade Libya , but I ' m proud of us for giving them a fighting chance by evening the playing field .
People here have been pointing out how we have n't been intervening in other countries in exactly the same way .
I do n't think we should , nor do I think that would be even possible .
But this shows that we can try when given a good opportunity .
And if other countries know that we can and will , that will help things so that we wo n't have to .
I 'll be very interested in seeing what happens when we stop using oil for gasoline , and then we still help out a middle eastern country .
Will people say its because we need to satiate the American palm date barons ?
And for those of you who spout those gems about ` ` why do n't we worry about our own problems '' , I would suggest that just because your cable news channel only has one feed on does n't mean that the rest of the country is n't doing anything .
If you want to stop crime or poverty in your own country , I suggest you become a cop or a social worker .

True that abstention in voting shows empathy , but it has to go further than that .
After the betrayal of friends like Mubarak and perhaps later on of Saleh and the multiple kings , all of the successors will arm themselves to the teeth and no country will dare give up nuclear power or any firing power to the US\/UN .
Iraq gave up 38 skud missiles via Bix and shortly afterwards , Bush took Iraq like taking candy from a baby , with the help of the european stoogies and boasted of allied power .
It was the UN that disabled Saddam and could not stop Bush to go for the jugular .
Khadafi gave up his weapons and chemicals .
He went down the same way .
When he had these weapons , no one dared to touch him , just like when Saddam had his toys .
Iran and North Korea are smarter than the world give them credit for .

Reply Dr. Ali Hamdi , author of the healing bill book America has never abandoned any of its friends or allies ; to say nothing of an unarmed nation who has been mercilessly murdered by militia members and mercenaries from Cuba , Venezuela , Chad , Mali , Zimbabwe , and other parts of Africa .
It is therefore unfair to criticize the very nations that freed Kuwait , Afghanistan , Iraq , Kosovo , and Bosnia & Herzegovina for helping a tormented nation .
I am very much aware that for the Chinese regime which like the Libyan one has massacred its own people in Tiananmen square and Tibet and the Russian government which killed thousands of innocent people in Chechnya and elsewhere deem the Libyan blood to be cheaper than a drop of oil and it is perhaps colorless .
<TIMEX3 tid="t509" type="DATE" value="2011-03-24">March 24 , 2011</TIMEX3> at <TIMEX3 tid="t511" type="TIME" value="2011-03-24T09:23">9:23 am</TIMEX3> | Reply Dr. Ali Hamdi , author of the healing bill book The Security Council must regard corruption and its related offenses as intentional crimes and treat corruption , violation of human rights and the monopolization of authority and power the same way genocides , ethnic cleansing , and hostile activities against other nations are treated .
When Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait , the Security Council issued many resolutions to deter him although the population of Kuwait was only three million .
The Security Council is therefore requested to issue similar resolutions and arrest the Arab dictators who violated human rights and enslaved not only three million but hundreds of millions of their fellow citizens .
Because of the stronghold that many Arab dictators have firmed up and the ineffectiveness of coups , the reform in countries of atrocity necessitates the intervention of the United States , the Security Council , Human Rights Organizations , the Civilized World and the International Community as a whole .
There are many grounds to support such intervention ; terrorism has begun in such countries as a result of the dictators violation of Human Rights and then spread like a cancer into the whole planet from such corrupt countries .
Our dictators should solely be liable to the International Community for the pandemic - like diffusion of the ethical disease that destabilized the world and weakened the developed countries economy .
It is a horrible mistake to believe that Saddam Hussein was the only one who raised money for terrorist organizations or harbored terrorists ; most of the Arab dictators have been doing the same thing in three ways : while some of them supported the terrorists to shake the Israeli security , others have either harbored them with a view to destabilizing their neighbors or just to repel their chanceful hoax .
Our dictators have been propagating hate ideas that threaten the convergence that is realized in respect of the dialogue of civilizations , not to mention their continuous violation of human rights and the inhuman practices a lot of people have unnecessarily undergone on part of such despotic dictators and their militias ; this situation pushed a lot of desperate people to join the terrorist groups in quest of getting rid of their lives .
The Security Council , which is supposed to reconcile between countries , must enact laws that enable the International Community 's interference in respect of the sought after reform in any country and issue resolutions with regard to dictators and officials who oppress their fellow citizens .
Oppressed citizens mustn t only be regarded as refugees and incarcerated like kettle in refugee camps , but must be treated with respect and great concern ; as for their claims , they must be given the same dimensions and level of concern that is usually given to cases filed against war criminals .
Arab dictators must be summoned to Amsterdam , New York , Geneva , or any foreign country and prosecuted and punished for the crimes they committed as in Saddam Hussein and Slobodan Milosevic 's cases .
If they are found guilty , they must be arrested , toppled , and punished .
Their victims must be well represented and allowed to talk the way we witnessed during Saddam s trial ; further more , such victims must be accommodated in five star hotels and enjoy the same services and respect their foes may enjoy all throughout the time of their trials .
Because a country is according to the United Nations Organization composed of its inhabitants and its land , sea and air , violating the inhabitants rights must impose the interference of the International Community and the Security Council whether the offender is a foreign country or from amongst the same country .
Justice can not be fully established if partiality finds its way to the United Nations Judiciary System or the Security Council s offices .
It is the responsibility of superpowers like the USA , Great Britain , France , Germany , Australia , and other peace - loving countries to launch this initiative to clean the world from injustice and dictatorial regimes .
Being named The United Nations Organization and not The United Countries Organization clearly indicates that the nations are the most important factor in the said Organization as the name suggests .
The United Nations Secretary General and his staff know that a lot of people throughout the world have been going through injustice and deprivation on part of their dictators ; even though , no measures have been taken to diminish their sufferance , yet .
Every time a Secretary General is elected we rejoice and expect to see him issuing deterring resolutions , but apparently justice has not been amongst the United Nations ' concerns as far as the red carpets are laid to the Secretary General by such dictators .
Are the leaders more important to the United Nations Organization than the millions of people the dictators have enslaved ?
If the answer is yes then the International Organization must change its name to read : the United Leaders Organization .
Since the answer is no , this Organization must assume its full responsibilities and free the millions of oppressed people around the world and establish justice in their countries .
The inhabitants of this planet who are the basis of the foundation of the United Nations Organization rely on their Organization , the United States of America , the Civilized World and all countries that love peace and justice to topple the last dictators and free the world .
We can not wait anymore to see the world completely free of evil and injustice .
The United Nations is therefore requested to establish courts where ordinary citizens can complain against their leaders and sue them whenever they violate human rights , transgress or monopolize the dominion .
The United Stated of America has taken a vital part in preaching and spreading democracy in the world and has successfully changed the destiny of many nations ; however , many oppressed nations are still waiting to see the 101st Airborne Division , the 3rd Infantry Divisions , and other American brigades and battalions dumping the dictators in hell .
The dictators have always formulated trivial pretexts with a view to coating the violations of human rights in such entities with false sovereignty pretexts , and claimed that local affairs of their countries must be treated within their territories without foreign interference .
Such ostensible excuses mustn t be acceptable to the International Community anymore , because they have helped envelope the despotic leaders crimes with an illegal tricky legitimacy ; they are the same pretexts that helped a lot of Arab and African dictators kill millions of their fellow citizens .
The United Nations Organization is requested to enact laws that enable observers from the International Community to see and report how oppressed nations are living , because the horrible life conditions that a lot of people have been going through can not be detected by the foreign ambassadors who usually live in luxurious villas and maintain electric generators in their embassies and residences that start automatically as soon as the electric power is off to the extent that they do not even feel that the electric power was interrupted .
The authorities in many corrupt countries can interrupt the electric power and deprive major parts of any city from electricity for <TIMEX3 tid="t515" type="DURATION" value="PTXH">many hours</TIMEX3> without warning .
The intentional interruption of electric power can occur in the middle of a surgery , a lecture , or a long waited seminar , movie , or television series .
It happened that a surgeon lit few candles to finish an appendectomy for his client due to an intentional electric power interruption that was aimed to devastate the inhabitants of that particular quarter as a punishment for their continuous reform related demands .
The Security Council and all the developed countries are requested to alleviate the sufferance of oppressed people through effective means such as the enforcement of democracy in dictatorships and the legislation of laws that prohibit the dictators from their usual recourse to trivial pretexts that serve nobody except themselves .
An initiative of this kind will be a great idea that serves not only justice in the world but will without doubt reduce all the terror activities that have resulted from injustice .

The permanent members of the Security Council are invited to issue a resolution in this regard and propagate it all over the world to let everyone whether he is a leader or a subject know that he is not above the international laws and regulations .
As a matter of fact , there are many leaders and officials like Saddam and Slobodan Milosevic who need to be overthrown and prosecuted for recorded crimes against humanity ; the American , the Australian , and European immigration offices are rife with scary stories many immigrants have endured .
This resolution must clearly stipulate that presidential candidates must sign a Security Council sponsored written commitment to establish justice , fight injustice , surrender transgressors and terrorists irrespective of their ranks or positions , and undertake that nobody may be excluded from this obligation or enjoy any presidential , religious , tribal or diplomatic immunity when it comes to the violation of human rights and the failure to establish democracy ; such pledge must be signed before such presidents are allowed to start campaigning .
There must be a global commitment to not considering any body in any part of the world above the law .
Whether the issue is about genocides or individual cases , the Security Council must treat such cases with the same level of concern , and if necessary forms committees of inquiry and a special army to bring to justice all outlaws who refuse to appear before their judges or fail to respond to such demands .
Partiality , favoritism , and interests must be completely avoided where the concerned judges , investigators , and personnel should be absolutely independent and let work freely in any country and anywhere including palaces , mosques , churches , synagogues , and temples .
They mustn t be of any religious , political , geographical or ethnic predisposition .
I believe that in presence of such global state of chaos and ethical degradation it will not surprise anyone of us to wake up in the morning and learn that a pro - Taliban group has regretfully toppled the Pakistani President in an overnight coup and seized the Pakistani nuclear arsenal .
Although this scenario is furious in view of the brutality and hostility the group has been exhibiting , it is never farfetched .
That is why the implementation of democracy in the world is as vital as the non - proliferation of weapons of mass destruction .
Establishing justice , implementing democracy , fighting terrorism , eradicating dictatorial regimes , fighting poverty and diseases , in addition to the non - proliferation of WMD must be the Civilized World Countries highest concern .
If the Security Council wishes to see the world better , its members must issue a resolution that stipulates that all corrupt and dictatorial regimes must be replaced by democracies where no leaders may govern for more than two terms of <TIMEX3 tid="t522" type="DURATION" value="P4Y">four years</TIMEX3> each .
The unconditional recognitions that the International Community has unfortunately granted to the kingdoms , sheikhdoms , sultanates , and dictatorships that resulted from chaotic states and gradually gained international recognition over time must be reviewed , canceled , and replaced with democratic republics .
For those who think they can prove me wrong , I remind them that except for the intervention of President Bush and his brave army , the Emirate that the Taliban Group had created on 90 % of the territories of Afghanistan would have gained full international recognition as a country and many of the criminals who enslaved the Afghani people and deliberately slain his men and shot his women dead , as we saw on TV , would have gained international recognition and walked on red carpets in many parts of the world by <TIMEX3 tid="t523" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> .

Likewise , the Arab kingdoms , sultanates , sheikhdoms , states , and republics have , in fact , gained international recognition when similar chaotic conditions in the past had left no room for the international community to calculate things the right way and depend on virtues in the way they recognized states and entities .
If the United Nations Organization is not able to correct such historical mistakes , the superpowers , in view of the damages they incurred as a result of the ethical mutation that was created by the dictators , must alternatively force the regimes that rule such entities to establish justice and implement democracy or give way to better regimes .

Reply The Libyan civil war is not in America 's interest .
Our armed forces , equipment and treasure have a primary purpose of protecting American lives .
We should abstain from the long term entanglements in Libya .
When America suffered its own civil war , we did not appreciate the interference of foreign powers .
Let the Libyans determine their own fate .
We 'll deal with the victors just as we deal with all other countries , hostile or friendly .

Just do n't forget that the French helped us during our revolution with the Brits .

Oh , and do n't forget our own civil war -LRB-
North and South -RRB- .
We did get help from both the British and the French -LRB- both sides -RRB- .

Though bloody and over 400,000 American souls perished , we eventually did away with slavery .
Without the Civil War , we would have been two separate countries -- one south very much similar to South Africa and still practicing separation of races .

Many have attributed the motivations of the protests across Middle East and North Africa -LRB-
MENA -RRB- to economic hardship -LRB- exacerbated by the global recession -RRB- and government oppression , chalking up the viral nature of the protests to social media .
This view is shortsighted and ignores the drastic impact demographic changes , shaped over decades , can have on political and social stability .
The answer comes down to demographics : in <TIMEX3 tid="t704" type="DURATION" value="P30Y">the last 30 years</TIMEX3> , these countries have developed large educated youth populations .
As these populations came to age , these countries were primed for change .
What Led Up to the Protests ?
Demographers have at times been admired for their ability to tell the future .
<TIMEX3 tid="t706" type="DATE" value="1981">Thirty years ago</TIMEX3> , a demographer could have told you the demographics of the Egypt , Libya , and Tunisia would be drastically different <TIMEX3 tid="t705" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3> and as such , so would the political and social environments .
Let s look at two factors that primed these countries for protests .
Increased Fertility Rates <TIMEX3 tid="t709" type="DURATION" value="P30Y">30 Years</TIMEX3> Ago .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t712" type="DATE" value="197" mod="END">the late 1970s</TIMEX3> and into <TIMEX3 tid="t711" type="DATE" value="198">the 1980s</TIMEX3> , Egypt , Libya , and Tunisia countries experienced increased fertility rates .
Fertility rates have since declined , but increased fertility rates <TIMEX3 tid="t713" type="DATE" value="1981">30 years ago</TIMEX3> have created <TIMEX3 tid="t714" type="DATE" value="2011-03-21">today</TIMEX3> s reality : the majority of people in Egypt , Libya , and Tunisia are under the age of 35 , resulting in increased demands for resources and jobs .
Increased Access to Education .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t717" type="DATE" value="198">the 1980s</TIMEX3> , priorities and public spending turned to building human capital .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t722" type="DURATION" value="P30Y">the last 30 years</TIMEX3> , life expectancy in Egypt , Libya , and Tunisia has risen by <TIMEX3 tid="t721" type="DURATION" value="P3Y" mod="APPROX">about 3 years</TIMEX3> and infant and child mortality rates have declined -LRB- Egypt cut theirs in half -RRB- .
A particular factor in priming North African countries for social change , however , was an increase in literacy and school enrollment rates , due to increased public priorities on education in <TIMEX3 tid="t723" type="DATE" value="198">the 1980s</TIMEX3> .
<TIMEX3 tid="t724" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Currently</TIMEX3> , 99 % of Libyan youth between the ages of 15 and 24 are literate ; the numbers are similar in Tunisia and Egypt .
Tertiary -LRB- post - secondary -RRB- school enrollment rates in Libya , for example , are about 50 % .
Compare that to 2.8 % in Kenya .
What makes Egypt , Libya , and Tunisia -LRB- and many other MENA countries -RRB- unique from other developing countries ?
In short , a relatively healthy and educated youth population .
Why does this demographic make a difference ?
Youth Are More Likely To Protest .
Numerous studies have shown that marriage and increased age reduce the likelihood of protest participation .
Youth who lack spousal and parental responsibilities are more likely to protest .
Access to higher learning opportunities increases information access and are often associated with increased expectation of government accountability , civil participation , and accessing formal employment opportunities .
Many other African countries have large youth populations , but often access to secondary and tertiary school education for these populations is extremely limited .
High Unemployment for Unemployment Leads to Instability .
Looking at the specific case of Tunisia , 97.1 % of children attend primary school and 71 % of youth attend secondary schools - impressive numbers by many accounts .
<TIMEX3 tid="t725" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> of those in the country who are unemployed , 41.7 % have a primary education , 37.7 % have a secondary education , and 13.6 % have a tertiary education -LRB- note that only 27.2 % of the population has a tertiary education -RRB- .
That means that more than half of the unemployed Tunisian population has accessed some kind of higher learning and while many of the unemployed in Africa can fall back on income - generating activities in agriculture , those in Egypt , Tunisia , and Libya are a bit more limited as non - agrarian industries dominate their economies .
Why is it Important to Understand the Impact of Demographics on Social Stability ?
The majority of African countries have large and growing youth populations , but higher education access has lagged behind .
However , if education rates accelerated to match population growth , protests , as seen in MENA countries , could be mimicked all across Africa .
Does this mean that countries should stop investing in education to prevent instability ?
Educated societies are critical to economic and social growth and well - being .
There is substantial evidence to support that East Asian investments in human capital and social programs , particularly education , were not only critical to economic growth , but also critical to social and political stability .
Social investments actually avoided political breakdown in several East Asian countries as governments responded , at least in part , population demands for public services .
However , an educated population , particularly a youth population will demand change and accountability from governments .
Developing countries , particularly African countries , can avoid substantial political and social breakdowns by identifying , including , and responding to the voices of their changing populations , particularly their growing youth demographics .
