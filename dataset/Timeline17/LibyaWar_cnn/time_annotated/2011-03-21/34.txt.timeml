The U.S. military has led the initial allied air attacks against Moammar Gadhafi 's forces in Libya , which began <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2011-W12-WE">this weekend</TIMEX3> .
Something about it reminds me of the way the war in Iraq started <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2003">eight years ago</TIMEX3> .
The U.S.S. Barry launches a Tomahawk missile .
But President Barack Obama insisted at a news conference <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="TIME" value="2011-03-21TAF">this afternoon</TIMEX3> that the U.S. will soon step aside and that the mission will then be controlled by NATO forces and other allies .
It was the first time the president has answered questions on the topic of Libya since allied airstrikes began <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2011-03-19">Saturday</TIMEX3> .
Republicans have sharply criticized Obama and his administration for the way they ' ve communicated about the U.S. military mission in Libya .
House Speaker John Boehner says he supports helping the people of Libya , but he also says : ` ` Before any further military commitments are made , the administration must do a better job of communicating to the American people and to Congress about our mission in Libya and how it will be achieved . ''
Sen. Richard Lugar , the ranking Republican member of the Foreign Relations Committee , echoed Boehner 's concerns , telling CNN 's John King he does n't understand the mission either and believes there are no guidelines set for success .
It 's not a partisan issue so far .
A group of liberal House Democrats held a conference call <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011-03-19">Saturday</TIMEX3> because they 're pretty upset that Congress was n't formally consulted before the U.S. and allies attacked Gadhafi 's forces .
They are concerned that involvement in the airstrikes could lead to a third war in the Middle East in which the U.S. is involved .
U.S. Rep. Dennis Kucinich , D - Ohio , even raised the prospect of impeachment over the president 's actions .
Here s my question to you : What is your understanding of America 's role in the Libya offensive ?
Interested to know which ones made it on air ?
The mission is to give aid and stop the ` ` genocide '' of people who want to remove a dictator of <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P42Y">42 years</TIMEX3> who uses military force to stay in power .
The world ca n't sit by and watch one more war of attacks on innocent women and children .
Obama is so slowwwwwwww .
If Obama acted <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2011-W10">two weeks ago</TIMEX3> , Gadhafi would have been circled by his people and probably been taken out by his people .
The result <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> is where we were with Saddam in Iraq .
No fly zone for <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="P5Y">the next five years</TIMEX3> , while Gadhafi will be killing his own people .
I just kind of figured it must have been some kind of a ` ` wage two wars , get a third war free '' promotion .
We get to spend the most money by using our expensive munitions to blast the command and control structure to hell , and the remaining countries get to practice their flying skills when it s safe to do so .
In other words , we bear the brunt of the expense , but no boots on the ground , so the President can say we are n't at war .
Government by public relations campaign .
My understanding is that we will take control of Libya 's oil production to help bring down the price of gas in the U.S. .
After that , we 're building a ` ` Disney : Middle East '' theme park on top of Gadhafi 's main compound .
We are there to clear the skies for England and France .
Once the air defenses are obliterated , we are in support .
Change the name of the country Libya to Iraq .
Change <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2011">the year 2011</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="1992">1992</TIMEX3> .
Change the name Obama to Bush .
The bottle might look different but the wine is still the same .
President Hillary Clinton has stated our position .
She is doing a great job while her subordinates travel and play golf .
I think we need to quickly get all military out of all cities ... except Tripoli .
Put the fear of death into all military that if they are seen in a military vehcile outside of Tripoli , then they are a target .
they isolate Ghadaffi , bring freedom to all the other cities .
Then , the UN moves in to setup elections .
Tripoli becomes a deserted stand alone entity with no oil revenues and no other option except to get rid of Ghadaffi .

instead we have <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> been directly involved in acts of war , in spite of the intent to keep international fighters protected from anti - aircraft fire .

To be apart of a coalition that protects the Libyans ; 2 .
To stop the Libyan Regime from killing its own people ; 3 .
To make sure no US Military Personnel are not on the ground ; 4 .
To obey the UN Resolution when dealing with the Libyan Regime .
I left off the name of the leader of libya , because it is hands off by the coalition of nations .
To Bad ! !

Then stepping back and letting others take over .
Which is what I hope we do .
Although the media is down playing the US military role ` ` We are the lead nation '' , directing everything from intelligence , to military targets and planes doing the bombing .
Some in the media would have you believe that France or Britian are leading this movement .
That 's not true , the US spent over 1 million dollars <TIMEX3 tid="t44" type="DATE" value="2011-W12-WE">this weekend</TIMEX3> to carry out this bombing mission .

The united States always seem to pray on weaker nations with oil under pretexts .
President Obama , like former President Bush is killing Arab .
President Obama is killing Libyan and destroying their country in the name of human right when we all know it is to militarily overthrow the Libyan government .
I do not like Gadhafi because he was instrumental in destroying Liberia and killing over 250 Liberian but going after him with superior military might is wrong .
The U.S. could easily assassinate him instead .
If president Obama is serious about stopping foreign leaders from massacring their own people , why his administration is not in the Ivory Coast , Bahrain , and Yemen ?
Why the United States is not enforcing the countless United Nations Resolutions against Israel for it long atrocities against the Palestinians ?
As an independent voter Obama lost my vote for any attempts on his part for the presidency in <TIMEX3 tid="t50" type="DATE" value="2012">2012</TIMEX3> .

I think that is a good idea .
We are already involved in two wars and a national debt that threatens our way of life .
We can not leave ourselves be sucked into another war .
There 's only so much a country can do and we have reached our limit .

We claim to be big on human rights and freedom , and we step - in to help others -LRB- or over - throw a government -RRB-
but only when such actions do not significantly hurt our oil supplies .
If we treated all opressive governemtns the same , we would have attacked Iran , Saudi Arabia ...
the list will seem never ending ...
but we do n't .
Either our policies are short - sighted , or we are just greedy for oil .
It seems like long as we can keep supplying the oil to our so called freedom loving citizens who have no morals and do n't care for human life in a distant land just as long as there is oil for them to waste -LRB- yes , waste , that is what we do in the US -RRB- .

and I seriously doubt anybody in Washington does either .
On the other hand , it does provide our military with a great opportunity to try out some of our sophisticated weaponry .
As we ponder whether oil or civilian safety is the real motivation , it is a good time to remember the Lincoln Brigade and the gallant Americans who got personally involved in the Spanish Civil War .

That we will protect the special interests in securing our sources of oil , and that ` ` doin ' Right ai n't got no end '' .

The Use is there to provide its unique capabilities in support of uN Resolution 1973 -- to protect Libyan civilians from being massacred by their own govt .
The USA is helping enforce international Law , after it was asked by the UN , the Arab League and the people of Libya .
This is multilateralism at its best , as promised by Candidate Obama -- <TIMEX3 tid="t89" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> carried out by President Obama .

No I do n't
and furthermore I think the President has been persuaded to do something his instincts told him not to .
The problem with any decision politicans make is they are all tainted with the question : What does this mean for my re - elction ?
I know it 's human nature to think in self promoting terms
but I 'd like to see a few decisons made based on what is the right thing to do without the cloud of ` ` holding on to an office '' swaying the decison .

We should not run the show and coerce anyone to do things our way .

That we are only going to be actively involved for just a short time .

We will be there FOREVER , just as we are seemingly in for the long haul in so many other countries !

We are there as part of a larger coalition of UN forces to provide support .
The question is ` ` Why ? '' .
What 's at stake for us .
Obama is allowing his foreign policy to be dictated by the UN and other outside influences .
His view is the US is an equal partner in global politics and believes in looking out for the collective good for the world .
What he does n't seem to grasp is the American people expect him to look out for what is in the best interest of America .
And most of the world feels they would be better if if the US was weak or hamstrung .
Libya shows a total lack of leadership and direction in our foreign policy .
It 's the only way to explain the lack of action on Iran or Egypt but military assistance for Libya .

Will the coalition also strike the rebels if they commit atrocities ?
are they just after Gadhafi ?
Or do they just want to create a balance that will force the various sides to the negotiating table ?
Too many gray areas and no clear objectives .
I suspect this will be a long one .

I ' ve listened to what the President has said about the US mission in Libya ...
and I understood exactly what he was saying .
Maybe those who do n't want to understand what s being said need to start listening more carefully and stop inventing their own versions of what is going on based on some insane need to create alarm .
And as far as political critics are concerned ; if Obama were Republican the Congress would be praising his every move , talking about his courageous action toward saving our shores from terrorists or some other worn out lie . .
Maybe he needs to land on a carrier somewhere and declare ...
President Obama is in a no - win situation here .
He was being heavily criticized for doing nothing and permitting the slaughter of civilians .
<TIMEX3 tid="t443" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> that he has intervened , he is being criticized for starting the 3rd war in an Arab country .
As long as it is a measured response within the bounds of the UN resolution , and the US gets out fairly quickly , I believe he will have pursued the best course .
From my point of view , the role of the US in Libya is to prevent more civilian casualties as well as prevent Gadhaffi 's regime from using military equipment to kill anti government protesters ; that was the consensus of the United Nations and should be respected .
The decision of the US along with other Europeans nations of dismantling Gadhaffi s arsenal would allow anti - government opponents to continue focusing their efforts in implementing a more democratic government in Libya .
My understanding is we wanted to quickly halt the military to prevent further harm to the citizens of Libya .
By doing this , we can enable them to hold their ground and continue the liberation of their country without much outside help .
The U.S. specifically delivered the brunt of the initial attacks on military targets to pave the way for the rest of the coalition which will handle the situation once control is handed over shortly .
If this is indeed what happens , I ' m in full support .

Protect the oil feilds from being destroyed by Gadhafi 2 .
Protect the people of Libya from being murdered by their leader .
Finish former President Ronald Reagans offensive against Gadhafi by bombing his residence in hopes he is their at the time counting his millions
This is what we signed up for after world war ll , being world police .
We as Americans have the solem duty of protecting the weak throughout the world .
The day we stop protecting the weak is the day we are weak ourselves .
I am amazed that so few people heard Obama , on television <TIMEX3 tid="t464" type="DATE" value="2011-03-19">last Saturday</TIMEX3> tell the American people that America was a part a colition that would establish -LRB- with others -RRB- a no fly zone over Libya .

So far what I ' ve seen from Obama appears to be thoughtful , deliberate , and well - prepared action .

I ' m getting very tired of every member of Congress seeming to think their way is the only way .
<TIMEX3 tid="t491" type="DATE" value="2011-03-21">March 21 , 2011</TIMEX3> at <TIMEX3 tid="t493" type="TIME" value="2011-03-21T17:08">5:08 pm</TIMEX3> | Here 's my concern .
How much is actually known about the rebels our military forces are <TIMEX3 tid="t494" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> protecting ?
I agree the we should n't ever stand by and let dictators slaughter their own people ; yet we do it all the time when those regimes are considered our allies or friendly to the West .
Why , for example , are we doing nothing to stop the killing of protesters in Bahrain ?
Is it because the regime is a U.S. ally and because of oil and other financial interests ?
How do we pick and choose where we will intervene in the brutal massacres of people by their own leaders , and where we will stand on the sidelines and shake our heads ?
But getting back to Libya , specifically what worries me is who and what will emerge once Gaddafi is gone .
We armed , aided , abetted , and actually created the Taliban in Afghanistan , believing that doing so was a way to thwart the Soviet Union .

And look what we got .
The rebels we 're <TIMEX3 tid="t495" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> supporting in Libya could well turn out to be radical fundamentalist Islamists dedicated to establishing a Taliban - style Islamic state in Libya .
Does anyone think such a state is going to be pro - Western or democratic ?
<TIMEX3 tid="t498" type="DATE" value="2011-03-21">March 21 , 2011</TIMEX3> at <TIMEX3 tid="t500" type="TIME" value="2011-03-21T17:08">5:08 pm</TIMEX3> | So who else thinks US military action in Libya is insane ?
I do n't dispute that Gadhafi is a ruthless dictator and is ` ` killing his people . ''
But does that make it okay for us to kill Libyans ?
Should the Russians have intervened when the Ohio National guard killed students at Kent State <TIMEX3 tid="t501" type="DATE" value="1970">1970</TIMEX3> ?
Want to punish the ruler ?

Stop buying what he sells ... . .
We would n't need what he sells if we spent 1\/10 the money we spend on offensive weapons on research into making alternative forms of energy more efficient .
I ask our leaders to stop displaying the definition of insanity , i.e. , doing the same things over and over again and thinking it will have a different outcome ...
How many of these ` ` wars '' do we have to get involved in before we figure it out ?
When the Libyans want and are ready for democracy they need to make it happen themselves .
Until then , we should embody the ` ` prime directive , '' i.e. , do not interfere in the evolution of others .
To do that we have to absolutely not need anything from those whose behaviors we abhor .
Note my statements here are regarding the internal affairs of sovereign nations .
If they strike outside their borders at us our our friends , we must strike back hard .

But no externally pressured regime change .
That is for internal evo - or revo - lution .

Remember ` Shock & Awe ' ?
We 're pretty good at that .
But then we really do need to back up & let everyone else do their part .
We went it alone in Iraq , one of the most bone - headed decisions in modern times .
I do n't really care if the President does n't inform the mealy - mouthed members of Congress -LRB- both parties -RRB- beforehand .
They would just whine and complain and jockey for political advantage no matter what he did .
As it is , the UN waited so long to approve this that Gadhafi was able to turn the whole situation in his favor .

Iraq did n't ask us or anyone else to interfere and the administration of the time lied to -LRB- or at least deliberately mislead -RRB-
the American people about why we needed to be there .
The Lybians , on the other hand , have practically been begging the rest of the world to intervene .
They 're dying at the hands of a half - mad dictator and need help .
If anybody should have been impeached it should have been the president who illegally started the war in Iraq .

Aside from that , the fact that the president is taking military action without consulting Congress or clearly communicating the situation to the American people is unacceptable .
This indicates his perception of the presidency as a dictatorial position rather than that of the chief executive .
Even though I have been staunchly opposed to our actions in Iraq and Afghanistan , I greatly support action that stops a madman from slaughtering his own people with the help of foreign mercenaries .

we are doing what America has both verbally and through action always done ...
we are defending those that ca n't defend themselves .
We are not in Libya to fight the battle for the rebels , but are there to defend the interests of those caught in the middle .

Pres .
Obama has been a humanitarian from the very beginning and it is no surprise to me that he has gotten us involved here .
I am glad to see that the plan is for us to step aside and let others lead the rest of this operation because everyone that is rushing in <TIMEX3 tid="t587" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> left us with Iraq and Afghanistan on our own for the most part .
I think that it is time for the world to be more involved with the task of ` ` policing the world '' that has tragically fallen on American shoulders for years .
Also , I think that getting out of the way and letting other countries lead the charge will potentially help remove the stigma that we are only involved in places over oil .
the message has not been communicated well to the American people .
We may not have lost any men in assisting with this ` No Fly Zone , ' but as a country that is running low on money it is important to remember that tomahawk missiles , fuel for naval vessels , and aircraft sorties are expensive .
Libya had better have been worth it .
My understanding is that the Libya offensive is a joint operation approved by the Arab League and the UN with the purpose of keeping Moammar Gadhafi 's forces from massacring those citizens who had opposed his long totalitarian rule .
Gadhafi 's troops were marching across the country , and he had decreed that he would search out and kill all his opponents .
President Obama has made it clear that the U.S. 's role is to be limited and that France and England have taken the lead in fulfilling the mission .

The verbal attacks on President Obama for either being too slow to support the opposition or too fast to do so without complete consultation demonstrate how difficult it is in the <TIMEX3 tid="t591" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> poisoned political atmosphere to map out a middle way .

The Europeans wanted the US to lead as usual so that they could go in as the peacemakers and enjoy the spoils of war . .
The Arab League wanted the US to go in so that they could have their bogeyman for the hungry masses . .
The Russians and Chinese obviously also wanted the US to go in so that they could extend their hands of friendship to these regimes .
President Obama played it perfectly and forced everyone to show their hand .
<TIMEX3 tid="t598" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> the Europeans are having to put their money where their mouth is , the Russians and Chinese had to vote for the UN resolution or face the backlash from the Arab streets .

Well , Mark , and anyone else for that matter , we do n't need to be involved in any more ` ` police actions '' .
I also understand what 's being ` ` said '' , but there are times you need to step back and analyze the entire situation .
It is definitely tragic that a tyrant is killing civilians , but that does n't mean that the U.S. needs to jump in to help out .
France was all gung - ho about getting in there , so let them do it .
This is one time that we need to ride the bench .
There are plenty of other nations who are more than willing to set up a pupet government in Libya .

What 's so hard to understand ?
It 's not a war , it is a humanitarian effort in protecting innocent people who asked for our help .

Military action is a method of reaction .
If you see innocent deaths likely to happen , you react .
Obama has been nothing but transparent on the topic .
He has been vocal on his hesitance and his eagerness to pull out A.S.A.P. .

If our country goes bankrupt who will bail us out .
Stay out of foreign affairs and re - build our country .
My understanding of the Libya No Fly Zone Offensive is very clear to me as President Obama publicly made the case for the institution of this operation -- the purpose for the No Fly Zone is to save the lives of Libyian civilians and to prevent genocide , the destablization of neighboring countries in the North African and Southern European region where a humanitarian crisis could ensue .
I do not understand the hysteria on the part of members of Congress about not being consulted .
The President has the legal authority to initiate military action without consulting Congress .
However , the President did consult with some Congressional members of both political parties prior to initating any military action .
I applaud President Obama for being cautious , prudent and willing to consult with members of Congress , his cabinet prior to taking any action .

This would be a limited operation that the U.S play a nonleading roll .
No U.S. ground forces would be deployed .
do not understand the hysteria on the part of members of Congress about not being consulted .
The President has the legal authority to initiate military action without consulting Congress .
However , the President did consult with some Congressional members of both political parties prior to initating any military action .
I applaud President Obama for being cautious , prudent and willing to consult with members of Congress , his cabinet prior to taking any action .

In support of the U.N. Resolution 1973 , the United States is offering its military services temporarily to the ` coalition ' in order to protect Libyan citizens from government abuses at the hands of Gaddafi as stated in the resolution .
The Libyan people should have the ability to make the choice on whether or not they want a Gaddafi government .
Gaddafi 's military has prevented them from having this option .
That is the purpose of the mission , to allow citizens to exercise their human rights to decide their government .
The U.S. policy , however , is in regard to the dictator itself because simply you can not call a mission a success without solving the problem .
Gaddafi is the problem .
Planes and guns did not fire themselves upon the Libyan people , Gaddafi did .
In order to make sure that such a crisis does not happen again , Gaddafi will have to be removed from power .
This can be done by allowing the Libyan people to hunt him down and decide his fate -LRB- believe me , they deserve at least this much -RRB- .
This can also be done by economic sanctions , international arrest warrants , account freezes , etc . and does not require military intervention .
This is n't the U.S. vs. Gaddafi , it is the world saying we have had enough and together we are enacting Resolution 1973 .
America is just a team player , not a leader .

The United States is assisting in the preservation of life for those countless Libyans that Ghadhafi has no compunction about annihilating .
We are assisting others from the UN in creating a no - fly zone and stopping the Libyan military and mercenaries from destroying innocent lives .
I do n't believe we will put a single American military foot on the ground , I think we are doing the right thing with the no - fly .

The biggest problem Obama faces <TIMEX3 tid="t1092" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> , is the same one that Bush faced in Iraq ...

Gaddafi will likely be executed in the process , Whether that happens as a casualty of the US assault , or those of our allies , or capture by the Libyan people and subsequent trial is largely irrelevant .
Freedom for Libya is the bbjective and Gadaffi the person has no price on his head for America any more .

To be sure , this is an oversimplification and may be offensive to some , but is n't that what we are really doing ?

The biggest trouble I see at that -LRB- 1 -RRB- Obama is hijacking the Constitutional provisions of our government by going over Congress ' heads and unilaterally making his own decision to enter this war -- and it IS a war .
When you bomb a foreign territory , it is WAR !
His lack of knowledge of how the real world work and his inexperience in governing is coming home to roost on those who thought that hope - y , change - y thing was going to happen under his leadership .

However , that is probably wishful thinking .
Either way , it is not going to achieve anything for its people or the U.S. if we and the supportive allies play more politics the likes of Iraq and Afghanistan .
Gadhafi is the problem of Libya .
He must be ousted or killed before escalation occurs .
We can not proceed halfheartedly or without the open resolve of ridding the world of Gadhafi ... and son .
He is a narcissistic sociopath that can neither be tolerated or trusted .
To not make him a target is to betray any valid purpose or intent to justify our being there .
Our presence , along with others , in Libya , must be first and foremost to rid its people of Gadhafi .
Obama and the Congress must tell the world this and do it swiftly and precisely .
Where have the republicans been hiding Jack ?
I ' m certain that they all know that the US 's role and stratagy in Libya is precicely the same as it is in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Maybe someday they will tell the American people what that is .

The difference is that your not really attacking another country , you 're wearing your world police hat .
We did n't get much consultation here in Canada either .
And these enforcements can go on for years .
Often with the US footing a bulk of the bill .
It is dis - ingeniousness for Republicans to criticize the US involvement in Libya when they rushed us off to war in Iraq with no road - map of what we were doing there or how to get out .
That was a systematic takeover of the country .
In addition , this is not Iraqi deja vu either .
This action is more akin to NATO 's past involvement in Serbia 's repression and genocide of its own citizens .
We should have let it play out with no US intervention .
We need to demonstrate that important world problems can be solved without us in a leadership role .
The Arab states should be able to handle it , and if not alone then with European help .
We are overextended as it is .
No one believes the limp explanation re human rights .
Since when have we been concerned with human rights ?
Not in Dafur , not the Congo , not the Ivory Coast , not Syria , and certaionly not Zimbabwe , where people were better off when it was Rhodesia .
No we should have sat it out .

Most of the action was in the air , with a wide ranging coalition .
We lost 1 soldier during that campaign - to an accident .
The President says we 'll soon take a back seat .
Difference between him and the last President is that I believe that 's what will happen .
No expectation of ` ` flowers on the tanks here . ''
Not like Iraq - where it was a war of opportunity with a coalition consisting of Britain , humanitarian aid from other major countries , and combat troops from every third - world country in eastern Europe .
We ' ve lost thousands of soldiers there .

He is not the first president to help out in these situations .
Should he let all these men , women and kids get slaughtered because you feel the way you do ?
I hope you do n't ever get in a situation where you need help , of any kind , and nobodys there for you .
If you have questions about the Rebels , go to Libya , find out for yourselves if you are really that concerned .
Congress spoke with the President and knew what he was doing .

Take all necessary action to protect civilian casualties seems a worthless statement when it 's armed civilians that are raising a rebellion .
In the end , I ca n't see where the U.S. or the U.N. has the moral or legal authority to determine who should rule in Libya .
I also fail to see how our bombing air defense sites in Libya meets the U.N. criteria unless Libyan forces are using them to shoot at the protesters .

Which there have no reports of as yet -RRB- .

This simply is protecting the Libyan civilian 's who are being slaughtered by its dictator .
Remember , the US is acting at the behest of the Arab League , the Libyan Council and the Libyan people .
This involvement , thanks to the Obama Administration 's has been focused on a limited involvement resulting by creating a ` ` no - fly zone '' .
The President has been very clear that no US troops will be sent to Libya .
I do n't understand all of the fuss being generated in Washington .
We have heard of the repeated claims that ` ` this is too little to late '' , and <TIMEX3 tid="t1279" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> we are hearing claims that there is no end to our involvement .

Qaddafi was using heavy artillery to bomb the Libyan equivalent of the Million Man march !

I supported the UNSC resolution long before there was one .
If Qaddafi was to remain in power , do n't you think he would return to terrorism and violent political oppression .
We need that like a hole in the head .
The president has the constitutional authority to do so .
Everyone of his critics would have done the same thing , and if they did n't , they would n't deserve the job in the first place .
When will people stop the partisanship , and recognize our president as doing , at the very least , a decent job ; I 'd go as far as to say , President Obama is doing a great job !

It is definitely rooted in diplomacy backed by the military in concert with the United Nations as warranted -LRB-
no - fly zone -RRB- -- not a unilateral measure .
All this frenzy about what is the US going to do to get Gadhafi out .
This is how we have gotten into trouble in the past .
The US is not the ruler of the world -- not its police force .

Coming from Middle East myself , I can very well relate to them .
And for those who say US should step away and let the opposition take over on their own I refer them to the happy and grateful reactions of the people of Benghazi who were hopelessly waiting for Qaddafi forces to conquer the city and introduce them to their dark destiny .

Libya is an African country , not the middle east countr , the African congress did not support this intervention .

The Arab countries and European countries will make gains if they can take the libyan oil off the market and Europe will benifit if they can gain control and sell the oil from Libya .

The missile attacks on Lybia were : 1 .
Iniated and agreed upon by the United Nations Security Council ; 2 .
The United States did not act alone .
Obama acted as part of a united coalition of allies including Arab nations , England , France , etc . 3 .
The air strikes were aimed at military weapon 's sites in Lybia -- not on Kadafi or innocent civilians ; I do believe the United States should not conduct a war by itself ! !
I feel strongly that participation in a United Nations ` ` peace - keeping '' response to the subversive indiscriminate violence against innocent civilians and protesters MUST BE ADDRESSED .
Seems pretty clear to me .
Freeze assets , get a coalition together , sanction the hell of of Libya , diminish Gadahfi 's ability to get the upper hand , and let the opposition rise up while also providing humanitarian aid .
Do people not listen at all ? ?

Of course it is to remove Kadafi .
Beyond that wise men do not go .
First because paraphrasing Eisenhower , Plans do not survive the first day .
After that is is dictated by facts on the ground .
So Obama can not box himself in by declaring we will do such and such exactly .
Even if he could , he should not .
It is wise not to telegraph your punches and leave the enemy guessing .
My guess is the Republican noise machine knows all this and are just trying to stay relevant .
I also expected and have seen that NO FLY means NO HEAVY ARMS .
We will destroy all tanks , heavy artillery , etc , in the field .
We will destroy all means of antiaircraft .
We will destroy Command and Control infrastructure .

And I suspect we are doing more than a share of Cyber War as well to screw up his planning and control .
All these things must be included if you are to convince Kadafi that the jig is up .

Add to that the fact that Sarkozy made a fool of himself during the Tunisia\/Egypt affairs and is looking for a way to recover from that and it was almost assured that France and other like - minded European countries were going to act whether the US cared to or not .
It s important to remind ourselves that North Africans in Europe are like Latinos in America : A powerful minority .

To avoid unilateral condemnation of our actions by the Arab world , we will be led in absentia by one of them , so that the others may criticize us for the actions they have authorized .

and we all know it 's gon na end up being an American war .
My advise , do n't do it Mr. President .
And honestly , these guys in Lybia totally deviated from the model used by their fellow Middle Easterns in Tunisian and Egypt .
Those were peaceful movements and this one in Lybia is anything but peaceful .
They started this war and <TIMEX3 tid="t1586" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> they want us to go fight it for them .

When one considers the plurality of brutal regimes the US has both partnered with and propped up , it was incumbent upon the US to not act unilaterally in the Libyan case .
I fully support your efforts there .
They are just , they were pleaded for by the people you are helping and clearly they were needed .
My question is how is it possible when there are such gains to be made in the hearts and minds of people the world over , that some in your Congress have the need to shout down the good work done in the name of the suppressed .
Those politicians are sheer opportunists and should be seen as such .
They have nothing to add to the mix except division .
It is high time that one nation on this planet started to act like its ' forefathers wanted it to , that is to truly act in the name democracy and the inevitable freedom that results from it .
Acting on behalf of people who can clearly judge the true nature of any intervention is the most important criteria in determining ` national strategic interest ' .

However , my understanding is also that our government has no concrete plan as to an suitable ending ... nor do they really know who the rebels are that they are assisting .

Are these rebels really the people we want having an upper hand in Libya ?
No one seems to be asking this question .
The U.S. and its allies are trying to prevent Gaddafi from overwhelming and killing off the Libyan opposition .
It 's a worthwhile operation .
Immediate action was necessary .
Kucinich is an idiot who should n't even be in Congress .

Getting rid of Gaddafi , and protecting civilians , is one in the same .

These centuries old suppression of the people in the name of religion is not helping those people to see the lights of their lives with science and technology .
It is the responsibility of the West to help them get out of the darkness of brutality and tyranny of their dictatorship so that they can build their better future .

This is another sad decision on the part of the American government .
If we have personal issues with Gadhafi , we should handle it in a different manner instead of support rebels as a way of retaliation .
Here are the problems : 1 .
The mission is not defined .
What is the definition of victory for this mission or when will it end .
We do not have any direct connection with the rebel group .
I thought we should have learned enough lessons from Iraq , Afghanistan , and other wars , and learn to better approach issues such as this .
If Russia or China -LRB- who are not part of the coalition -RRB- decides to support Gadhafi , where are we headed ?

In addition , each member of the coalition forces ' military have a different objective all together , but one they will not share with other members of the same coalition .
There is no doubt that every person that has been around since the 70 's understands that Colonel Gaddafi is one of the most saddistic dictators in the history of the modern world .
So , we would like this man 's dictatorship to end .
However , Libya is a sovereign nation , and like many other nations that have suffered through the pain , blood shed , or all the other nasty aspects of civil war , Libya has to endure it themselves .
<TIMEX3 tid="t1726" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> , the nations of the world can assist our Libyan brothers , just as France assisted the United States , to fight those that oppress them .
One thing is for sure : Blood will be spilled , and in some cases , Libyans will raise arms against their Libyan brothers .
This because there are supporters of Gaddafi , and of course there are those who oppose him .

But the notion that this will be resoved without the shedding of human blood , unfortunately is incorrect .

Obama wanted nothing to do with this No - Fly business , but he and his European friends realized that it was going to be IMPOSSIBLE without the help of the United States of America .
Sure the French made a show by sending a few aircraft over Libya and the Brits fired off a few missiles , but the only nation that has the ability to put the whole package together is the USA .
This is perhaps more important than the situation in Libya at this moment .
It literally means that Europe is so combat ineffective they can t police anything beyond their own borders .
Obama had no choice but to back up his European allies and their oil supply , no matter whether Libya has anything to do with direct US interest .

It was made clear that we are merely there to implement a no fly zone and protect the citizens from attacks by the military .

My understanding of US 's role is exactly what Pres .
Obama stated <TIMEX3 tid="t1783" type="DATE" value="2011-03-21">today</TIMEX3> in Chile , that the military actions by the UN -LRB- including the US -RRB- are humanitarian , to protect Libyan civilians , and that US policy -LRB- separate from the military action -RRB- wants Gadhafi gone , and the US has already done much -LRB- non - military -RRB- in that direction .
Maybe if Speaker John Boehner watched CNN he would know more about what 's happening .
Seriously though , the UN action in Libya is already late , IMO , and getting ` permission ' from Congress would have taken so long to have killed any hope the Libyan peasants had , not to mention their lives .
If members of Congress are simply complaining about being ` properly ' INFORMED , then they are disrespecting the president , and undermining his authority in front of the world doing so publicly .
Some folks have no manners .
If they want to object to the US 's involvement with the UN resolution to take action in Libya , they should pipe down about communication etiquette , and go through the proper channels to object to helping the Libyan people .
It 's not just Obama that made these decisions .

No boots on the ground protect the opposition <TIMEX3 tid="t1789" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> under fire and suppress the Gaddafi forces with airstrikes , make a window for the NATO forces and hand off the progress to NATO command to continue watch until the snake stops moving .
We are trying to squeeze Gaddafi forces and sources until he can not move or breath .
The Libyan people that are called the opposition need to step up and remove him not us ...
The Libyan people have to when this battle
and they are the only ones that no friend from foe .
Clearly President Obama did not want this fight .
The only thing I need from Obama is the exit strategy not how long it s going to take to get Gaddafi .
Oh congress they can t even make a budget .
Republicans , Independents and Democrats are useless .

A fighter jet , troops , or support sent , that is our own , which is sent across a border of another nation in order to aid and abet killing someone else , is why many people consider it war .

Cherry picking when you want to call it ` ` support '' or when you call it ` ` a nation at war '' is ridiculous .
Let 's make it perfectly clear , if an innocent child or women can accidentally be killed by something on the ground OR by something raining down on them from the sky .
