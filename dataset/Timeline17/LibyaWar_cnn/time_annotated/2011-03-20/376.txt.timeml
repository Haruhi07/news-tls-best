In a rare public spat , Russian President Dmitry Medvedev criticized his political mentor , Prime Minister Vladimir Putin , for Putin 's comments over the use of force against Libya .
Putin on <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2011-03-14">Monday</TIMEX3> said the U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing a no - fly zone over Libya was ` ` obviously incomplete and flawed . ''
He added that it ` ` resembles a medieval appeal for a crusade in which somebody calls upon somebody to go to a certain place and liberate it . ''
<TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DURATION" value="PTXH">A few hours</TIMEX3> later Medvedev weighed in , scolding Putin 's comments , without using the prime minister 's name .
` ` It is absolutely inexcusable to use expressions that , in effect , lead to a clash of civilizations - such as ` crusades , ' and so on .
That is unacceptable , '' Medvedev said .

Libyan government officials brought CNN and other news crews to the compound to view a building that was damaged <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="2011-03-20" mod="END">late Sunday</TIMEX3> in a coalition air strike .
The Fox story , posted on the outlet 's website <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="2011-03-14">Monday</TIMEX3> , says the journalists ' presence forced a British aircraft to call off firing seven missiles at the area that already had been hit .
Robertson , who was part of the CNN crew cited in the Fox story , called the rival network 's report ` ` outrageous and hypocritical . ''
Robertson said a Fox staffer was among the journalists on the trip - which was not mentioned in the Fox report - and that the journalists in the group were hurried through their trip by their minders .
` ` If they wanted to use us as human shields ... they would have kept us there longer , '' Robertson said .
` ` That 's not what happened . ''

Obama repeated <TIMEX3 tid="t51" type="DATE" value="2011-03-14">Monday</TIMEX3> that Moammar Gadhafi ` ` needs to go , '' but he acknowledged the Libyan dictator may remain in power for some time because the allied military mission in North Africa has a more narrow U.N. mandate of just protecting civilians .
Still , Obama noted : ` ` I also have stated that it is U.S. policy that Gadhafi needs to go . ''
Obama said he 's still hopeful that other ` ` tools '' the administration has used , such as freezing billions in Libyan assets , will eventually help the Libyan people push Gadhafi out .

` ` There is no information of killed civilians recorded by the French command , '' French government spokesman Francois Baroin said on the French TV channel Canal + <TIMEX3 tid="t258" type="DATE" value="2011-03-14">Monday</TIMEX3> .
Libyan ruler Moammar Gadhafi 's regime claimed that dozens of people - mostly women , children and clerics - have been killed in the international airstrikes that started <TIMEX3 tid="t259" type="DATE" value="2011-03-19">Saturday</TIMEX3> .
` ` We must be cautious of communication campaigns and propaganda .
...
This is a military operation and a communications campaign battle , '' Baroin said .
` ` We have to trust what the international community is communicating . ''

Monday</TIMEX3> in Libya -RRB- U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said it would be ` ` unwise '' to set specific goals about targeting Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi directly during attacks .
` ` I think that it 's important that we operate within the mandate of the U.N. Security Council resolution , '' Gates told reporters <TIMEX3 tid="t266" type="DATE" value="2011-03-20">Sunday</TIMEX3> while on a plane to Russia .
` ` If we start adding additional objectives , then I think we create a problem in that respect .
I also think that it is unwise to set as specific goals , things that you may or may not be able to achieve . ''
The Security Council resolution , which passed <TIMEX3 tid="t273" type="DATE" value="2011-03-17">Thursday</TIMEX3> , allows member states ` ` to take all necessary measures to protect civilians under threat of attack in the country ... while excluding a foreign occupation force of any form on any part of Libyan territory , '' according to the United Nations .

A coalition military official has confirmed that Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi 's compound was targeted by airstrikes <TIMEX3 tid="t277" type="TIME" value="2011-03-20TNI">Sunday night</TIMEX3> .
The compound was targeted , the official said , because it contains capabilities to exercise command and control over Libyan forces and the coalition goal is to degrade his military capabilities .
Earlier , Western journalists , including CNN 's Nic Robertson , were brought inside the compound to survey the destruction .

An announced list of the countries participating in the military coalition : The United States , Belgium , Britain , Canada , Denmark , France , Italy , Norway , Qatar and Spain .
U.S. officials have said they plan to hand over operational control of the military mission in <TIMEX3 tid="t288" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">coming days</TIMEX3> .
WE need to remember it is not the UN 's job to get Ghaddafi out , they do n't have any authority to do this it is the job of the UN to keep him from killing his own people .
I know everyone is up in arms about us being in conflict with another arab country but this was a unanimous vote to help keep the civilians of Libya safe from their evil leader .

And if this ever happens in your country , where ever you are from , I hope the UN steps in to help you too .

Because I know that the US and its allies will , because it 's their job .
Civil wars happen all the time and does n't usually need interventions from other countries until unarmed civilians are getting set up to be wiped out from the govt .
IF UN WANTS TO FREE LIBYAN PEOPLE FROM THE ATROCITIES AND TYRANNICAL RULE OF COL .
GADHAFI , STRIKING ALLIANCE SHOULD DEVICE SUCH A PLAN THAT EITHER ONLY GADHAFI IS CAPTURED OR DIRECTLY ATTACHED .
IT SOUNDS INHUMAN BUT TO MINIMIZE THE DAMAGE , CIVILIAN 'S DEATHS AND SHORTEN THE WAR PERIOD , THIS IS THE ONLY SOLUTION IN SIGHT .
BUT IT SHOULD BE DONE IN SUCH A TACTICAL WAT THAT IT SHOULD SEEM TO BE A PART OF WAR AND NOT PERSONAL ATTACH .
AND THEREAFTER UN SHOULD CONDUCT FREE AND FARE DEMOCRATIC ELECTIONS WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF INDIA ALSO AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE AND HAND OVER THE REIGNS OF POWER TO THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND ALSO TAKE BACK THE MILITARY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO WIN THE CONFIDENCE OF LIBYAN PEOPLE
AS WELL AS TO AVOID ANY MISCONCEPTION OR MISINTERPRETATION BEHIND THE ATTACH BY OTHER ARAB COUNTRIES .
It all about oil .
Why NATO did not invade Yemen , Ivory Coast ?
Bahrain got problem , America support neighbouring forces invasion .
Arabs being used by super power .
Arabs are not united and will not united till the END .
Shame shame shame on you .
Arabs are the looser .
We have problem that we can not solve .
Leave other people alone .
We should not take side in other country 's civil war .
Stop spending money that we do n't have .

Too many problem in the world .
We can not solve them all .
We should not choose between two evils .
High horse Congressmen criticizing Obama 's decision to participate in the ` ` no fly zone '' over Libya .
If he were a Republican , the Republican congressmen would n't be so critical .
If he were n't so decisive as a commander in chief , the democrat congressmen would n't be complaining either !
Sorry folks , but we have one commander in chief and he has been very clear about his intentions all along .
At least he is n't unilaterally taking on Libya -LRB- as our former president would have done -RRB- , but is acting on a United Nations resolution .
I say he 's doing it right .
So step back out of the lime light congressmen , and let the man do his job !
You can whine later about not being president yourself !
I m ALL for the U.S. in Libya even if it means ground forces , we should be helping people who are fighting for their Freedoms and preventing mass slaughters !
As for the ones in congress trying to ride on the popularity of fears of War and such , they are an embarrassment and hope they are voted out ! !
If Yeman needs helps so be it , I for one think we need to do something about Somalia , Clinton was right going in there but this time we should wipe it off the map ! !
This attack on Libya was planned out well and it shows how Smart our President is , I like that !

As for Iraq and Afghanastan all were very poorly planning which prolonged our objective .
When you send in ground forces , you do not go in with a limited amount .
If we would have flooded Iraq with ground foreces and Tanks it would have been over fast , same goes for Afghanastan .
We want a Free World and a better world for our children , then we need to do what we can to rid it of terrorist and dictators who are a world threat .
Libya 's Leader was nothing but a Terrorist .
Then we have Korea whose leader is so unstable he could be the one to start a Nuclear War .
We have to take these kind of leaders out , hiding under a rock and playing nice and flapping our lips will not take away the Problem ! !
One thing President Bush was right about , he said once Freedoms in the Middle East is establishest and leaders like Sadam is taken out , Freedom will spread , well , look what s happening <TIMEX3 tid="t290" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> , there fighting for their Freedome , what s wrong with backing that ? ?
Your news cover is wrong .
The plane shot down is a F-15E model .
I have confirmed this by the photo description that it is infect this plane .
I have studied the plane and have looked on several news sights such as BBC .
Please review the statement made on CNN that the plane was a F-16 .
Obama is hiding while caddafi lives up to his promise searching house to house to kill domonstrators in masarata .
When you look at the countries involved in the Lybian war and you compare it in <TIMEX3 tid="t291" type="DATE" value="17">the 18th century</TIMEX3> with Napolean it is north surprising .
The Western world like a olt of uglyness The Western World is constantly talking about terrorist attack .
Who was responsible for bombing Martin Luther 's house in the United States , for sure it was not the Lybian leader nor Saddam .
They seems to forget what they did to the blacks in America and Canada for <TIMEX3 tid="t292" type="DURATION" value="P400Y">four hundred years</TIMEX3> .
