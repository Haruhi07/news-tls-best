CARL AZUZ , CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR :
Military action is underway in the skies over Libya , and the U.S. is one of several countries involved .
It 's our first story in the week 's first edition of CNN Student News .
AZUZ :
It 's called ` ` Operation Odyssey Dawn , '' and the goal is to enforce a no - fly zone over Libya .
The United Nations Security Council voted for that no - fly zone <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2011-W10" mod="END">late last week</TIMEX3> .
The coalition responsible for enforcing it is made up of forces from the U.S. , Great Britain and France , among others .
After the Security Council 's vote , Libya 's government declared a cease - fire in its fighting with rebel forces .
And it invited representatives from other nations to come to Libya to make sure the cease - fire was real .
Coalition forces were convinced that Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi was not following the rules of the cease - fire .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-03-19">Saturday</TIMEX3> , the coalition attacked .
You can hear the sounds of gunfire in the capital city of Tripoli .
A U.S. commander said missiles landed near the capital and around other cities as part of these attacks .
The fighting between Colonel Gadhafi 's forces and rebels raged on in other cities , like Benghazi .
Here , you can see a fighter jet that was shot down over Benghazi on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2011-03-19">Saturday</TIMEX3> .
Admiral Michael Mullen , the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff , said on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011-03-20">Sunday</TIMEX3> that coalition forces had taken out most of Libya 's air defense systems .
But Admiral Mullen also said the U.S. role in ` ` Operation Odyssey Dawn '' would be limited , saying ` ` we 're not going to put any boots on the ground . ''
He 's harshly criticized the other countries getting involved with the civil war in Libya .
He called the coalition forces ` ` terrorists '' and promised a ` ` long - drawn war . ''
But <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2011-03-20">Sunday</TIMEX3> , a spokesman for the Libyan military called for another cease - fire .
U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA :
<TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2011-03-20">Today</TIMEX3> , we are both also delivering assistance and support to the Japanese people at their greatest hour of need .
The ties that bind our nations to Japan are strong .
In the United States , we forged an alliance of <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P60Y" mod="MORE_THAN">more than sixty years</TIMEX3> .
The people of Japan are some of our closest friends , and we will pray with them , and stand with them , and rebuild with them until this crisis has passed .

We 're starting to see some new effects of the nuclear crisis in Japan that resulted from a tsunami triggered by a 9.0 - magnitude earthquake .
<TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2011-03-19">Yesterday</TIMEX3> , the government health ministry banned the sale of spinach from the area near the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant .
Officials made that decision based on radiation levels that were over the government limit .
There were already bans on the sale of raw milk and restrictions on produce from the area surrounding the nuclear plant .
Workers inside that power plant were starting to see some signs of progress over <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2011-W10-WE">the weekend</TIMEX3> in their efforts to cool down these nuclear reactors .
But officials say ` ` even in the best scenario , there will be a lot of bumps ahead . ''
One they came across <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2011-03-20">Sunday</TIMEX3> was the possibility that they might need to release radioactive gas into the air .
They would do that in order to release some of the pressure that 's building up inside one of the reactors .
The tsunami knocked out the plant 's cooling systems , and getting those back online is crucial .
Allan Chernoff has a household comparison that helps explain why .
ALLAN CHERNOFF , CNN SENIOR CORRESPONDENT , NEW YORK : To get a sense of the challenge confronting the Japanese at the Daiichi nuclear plant , consider this situation in a kitchen : a pot with no water on top of a high flame .
Obviously , this dangerous situation could cause a fire in here .
Well , stay with me .
Those spent nuclear rods can generate tremendous heat , up to 2,100 degrees .
Enough to melt them , burn them and send radioactive material into the atmosphere .
They have to be kept under water , just like spaghetti when we 're cooking .
<TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> , those rods are normally kept under 30 feet of water , but according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission , in at least one of the pools in Japan , the rods are exposed ; there 's virtually no water or no water at all .
So , how do we resolve this situation ?
Well , if we do n't take the pot off the flame , we add water .
And that is exactly what the Japanese are trying to do <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3> ; any way they can , even dumping it from helicopters .
They are trying desperately to get water into that pool to avoid a nuclear disaster .

There was some good news on <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2011-03-20">Sunday</TIMEX3> when rescue workers found an 80 - year - old woman and her 16 - year - old grandson .
They 'd been trapped in their home for <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="P9D">nine days</TIMEX3> .
The news gave hope to other people whose loved ones are still missing .
But as Gary Tuchman explains , the search efforts are not easy .
GARY TUCHMAN , CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : Kesennuma , Japan .
The scene behind me here is one of chaos , confusion ; it is surreal .
If you see the video we took , you wo n't believe it .
At least , we did n't when we saw it in person .
So much debris , so much rubble .
It is like a canyon .
When we went down there , it 's like climbing a mountain .
Cars , boats , houses : pushed out of different neighborhoods , pushed out of different areas and blocking fire officials , military officials .
They 're looking for survivors , the possibility of survivors , or trying to find bodies .
We met a woman <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2011-03-20">today</TIMEX3> who told us her father was at the second floor of his house , made the decision to stay in the second floor when the tsunami siren sounded .
Well , anyway , at this point , they ca n't get to the house .
It appears the house is still there , but there 's so much rubble surrounding the house , there 's no way to check if this man survived .
It 's just an absolutely incredible scene .
It 's hard to imagine what the people here in northeastern Japan are going through .
The death toll is rising rapidly .
We know it will continue to rise .
We ourselves , just myself and my crew , found a body in the back of a car .
This is how they 're finding bodies , the officials .
There 's so much rubble down there they ca n't get to .
It 's very likely that it will be weeks or months before they come anywhere close to knowing what this death toll is .
And the aftershocks continue .
<TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="TIME" value="2011-03-19TNI">Last night</TIMEX3> , while we were sleeping , we felt at least six or seven sizable aftershocks , and that only increases the anxiety that people feel here in northeastern Japan .
This is Gary Tuchman , CNN , in Japan .

Haiti : a nation still struggling to recover from a devastating earthquake that hit it <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2010" mod="MORE_THAN">more than a year ago</TIMEX3> .
It 's also trying to resolve a presidential election from <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2010-11">last November</TIMEX3> .
None of the candidates got enough votes for an outright victory .
<TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2011-03-19">Yesterday</TIMEX3> , Haitians headed to the polls to vote in a runoff election .
One candidate is a former law professor and first lady .
The other is a Haitian entertainer .
There were some problems early on at a couple polling locations : missing ballot boxes , and not enough ink to mark who had voted .
But officials said those issues were resolved by later in the morning .
The final results of the runoff are scheduled to be released in mid - <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2010-04">April</TIMEX3> .
