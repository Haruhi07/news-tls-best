The battle for Zawiya is called ` ` urban warfare ''
Rebel forces in Tripoli are awaiting the ` ` zero hour , '' a spokesman says Some Gadhafi forces are going to Tripoli from other fronts Secretary of State Clinton expresses optimism Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- --
<TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="PXD" mod="MORE_THAN">Over the past few days</TIMEX3> , anti - Gadhafi forces have made ` ` significant advances '' -- in the northwest and in the regions of Misrata and al - Brega -- a spokesman for NATO 's military operation told reporters <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2011-08-16">Tuesday</TIMEX3> .
` ` Anti - Gadhafi forces are <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> assuming control of the key approaches to Tripoli , '' said Col . Roland Lavoie , who described the advances as ` ` the most significant anti - Gadhafi territorial gain we have seen in months . ''
Since <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2012-07" mod="END">the end of July</TIMEX3> , as the threat from pro - Gadhafi forces has diminished , thousands of people have returned to their homes in the western Nafusa mountains , he said .
Since <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011-08-12">Friday</TIMEX3> , the northwest coastal city of Misrata has been free of pro - Gadhafi forces , he said .
And the threat from nearby Zlitan has diminished as pro - Gadhafi forces are being pushed farther west , he added .
His weapon of choice ?
His brush Over <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2011-W32">the last week</TIMEX3> , NATO warplanes have damaged or destroyed some 150 military targets as part of Operation Unified Protector , Lavoie said .
` ` Our assessment , without going into details , is that the Gadhafi regime does not have anymore an effective operational capability , '' he said .
Lavoie said that rebels had occupied Surman and Sabratha west of Tripoli , but added that the regions were ` ` still contested . ''
However , Libyan state television reported that pro - Gadhafi forces and tribal fighters were ` ` cleansing the city of Sabratha from the gangs of traitors '' and had secured the coastal road , a key supply pipeline into Tripoli .
Though the center of Zawiya was under rebel control , ` ` there 's still reports of fighting also in the suburbs , '' Lavoie said .
Still , U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton expressed optimism .
` ` I think the sense is that Gadhafi 's days are numbered , '' she told reporters in Washington .
But a spokesman for the Gadhafi government offered a different view .
` ` We are doing very well , '' Ibrahim Musa told reporters .
` ` It 's true that it 's a bit slow -- people are still saying that we 're not acting immediately and that we 're having problems in Surman and Sabratha and whatnot because of armed gangs .
That 's true but , God willing , we are able to lead this battle successfully .
We will achieve peace and victory . ''
He added , ` ` We are fighting NATO -- not the tens or hundreds of armed gang members .
Our war is with the crusaders . ''
If rebels gain control of Zawiya , that would be a major stride in putting a stranglehold on the Gadhafi - controlled seat of power .
` ` We will be very careful entering Tripoli , which we hope to do by <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2011-08" mod="END">the end of this month</TIMEX3> , '' said Col . Ahmed Banni , military spokesman for the opposition National Transitional Council .
Banni said there is intelligence that some Gadhafi forces are moving to Tripoli from other fronts -- Terhouna in the southeast and Sirte farther east .
He said those forces have taken off their uniforms to blend in with the population , a ` ` dangerous '' sign those troops are preparing for a ` ` bloody war . ''
He said rebels in Tripoli <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> were supplied with arms .
But , he said , ` ` We asked them to stay put until the zero hour . ''
Col . Jumma Ibrahim , a spokesman for the rebels ' western command , said Gadhafi forces controlled most of the eastern part of the city and were shelling rebels with Grad missiles and artillery .
` ` There are still skirmishes with the brigades in the city center , with snipers taking positions , '' Col . Ibrahim said .
` ` The fight is <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> urban warfare there at the moment .
There have been a lot injured among our ranks but it is hard to give a number . ''
The rebels claim control of towns west of Zawiya to near Ras Jedeir .
These include Surman and Subratha .
` ` It is a huge deal and a decisive defeat for his forces in that region .
All these areas are liberated , '' Banni said .
Col . Ibrahim said Garyan , south of Tripoli 's city center , had been taken by rebels but Gadhafi loyalists were shelling them from a nearby town .
There has been ` ` fierce fighting '' in Terhouna .
He said rebel forces were surrounding Zlitan in the south , east and northeast and fighting Gadhafi forces .
He said there 's been fighting in the industrial area of al - Brega , where rebels control the residential areas except for one controlled by the Gadhafi government .
Gadhafi forces also control the industrial area , Banni said .
` ` He is trying his hardest to prevent us from access to $ 35 million worth of daily oil money under normal circumstances in al - Brega , '' Banni said .
` ` If we control the port and the refinery in the industrial area , we 'd have that money . ''
