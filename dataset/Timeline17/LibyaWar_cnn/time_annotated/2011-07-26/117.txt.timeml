It 's getting harder and harder to believe there 'll eventually be a resolution to Libya 's civil war that will allow anyone to claim Moammar Gadhafi lost to rebel forces or was humbled by members of the NATO - led coalition waging air strikes against him .
Indeed , it 's becoming increasingly clear as the weeks rush by that battle - weary European partners in the intervention force are keener to find ways of ending the conflict and pull forces back home than they are to obtain their initial objectives of seeing Gadhafi deposed and forced abroad .
The upshot is the sound of diplomatic throats being cleared ever louder to prepare public opinion for the <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> - probable scenario of the operation ending without Gadhafi having budged much .
As Tony Karon 's <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2011-07-20">July 20</TIMEX3> post noted , U.S. officials came away from <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> meetings in Tunisia with Gaddafi representatives repeating demands that the colonel must go as a part of any resolution to the conflict .
Yet even then it was becoming evident that what go ultimately entails may not meet the definition rebels have long advanced : of Gadhafi being forcefully driven from power , arrested , and handed over to the U.N. tribunal wanting to try him for crimes against humanity .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2011-07-20">July 20</TIMEX3> , French Foreign Minister Alain Jupp told French TV channel LCI that one of the hypotheses that 's envisioned is , indeed , that -LRB- Gadhafi -RRB- stays in Libya on the condition he very clearly leaves Libyan political life .
That considerably watered down position on the criteria to end the conflict was then repeated on <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2011-07-25">July 25</TIMEX3> by British Foreign Secretary William Hague .
While remaining adamant that Gadhafi must leave power , Hague left the Libyan leader 's fate beyond that open to question .
` ` Obviously him leaving Libya itself would be the best way of showing the Libyan people that they no longer have to live in fear of Gadhafi , Hague said <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2011-07-25">Monday</TIMEX3> , prior to his meeting with Jupp in London .
` ` But as I have said all along , this is ultimately a question for Libyans to determine . ''

All that money and lives wasted should serve as warning for the future that plans that were drawn in <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="198">the 80s</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="199">90s</TIMEX3> need to be rechecked before being implemented decades later .

They should n't have blown the trumpet in advance , before they know the tune , or else it 'd be embarrasing if it did n't come out as anticipated .

The french do n't have the balls to say that phrase , much less do it .
I was really excited to see how the french would do \ * their \ * Iraq .
Thought we might learn something . .
I ' m not impressed .
Mo is still there .

I feel bad for them ...
they are just jumping in the fry pan they were not in earlier .
If the Germans had a decent leader <TIMEX3 tid="t40" type="DATE" value="2011-07-26">today</TIMEX3> , they would n't be sending any money to those so - called ` ` rebels '' in Libya .
In fact , being German only by descent , I ' m still a better German than that country 's <TIMEX3 tid="t41" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> leaders who only crawl to the U.S. , Great Britain and France and act on their behest ! ! !

Reply yeah ,
yeah ...
give them funds <TIMEX3 tid="t46" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> ... incite conflict , supply ammunition , give funds by the millions ... for what ?
so that they can go ahead and kill their fellow countrymen ? ?
this is how outside countries should get involved ... in a ` ` revolution '' ...
you call this a revolution or a take over by foreign countries ?
Are nt all these countries going to get their millions back in the form of ` ` contracts '' from these so called rebels they are ` ` supporting '' ?
if you love to do humanitarian work ... love to do what is good for the people ... there are hundreds of people dying out there in a famine in the same continent ... send your money there .
Why do you think twice before supporting them ?
Because they are not rich and ca nt give you hefty contracts ?
Is nt this war totally and absolutely just ` ` for the money '' ...
each and every step of it ?
This is great news indeed , if true .
After all , the only legitimate leader Libya has is <TIMEX3 tid="t48" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> Mohammar Qadaffy and nobody else .
We have absolutely no right to decide Libya 's future nor do any of our worthless NATO allies ! ! !

If the West backs down eventually then Gaddafi will claim victory over them and the rest of the world .
