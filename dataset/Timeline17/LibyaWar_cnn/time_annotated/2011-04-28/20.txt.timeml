U.S. Ambassador to U.K. talks Libya Homes destroyed in battle for Libya The ICRC - chartered ship evacuated more than 600 civilians from the city , it said .
The IOM - chartered ship was carrying about 935 migrants and Libyans en route to Benghazi , the organization said in a news release .

In Washington , President Barack Obama on <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2011-04-27">Wednesday</TIMEX3> authorized up to $ 25 million in nonlethal commodities and services to be made available to ` ` support key U.S. government partners such as the Transitional National Council in efforts to protect civilians and civilian - populated areas under threat of attack in Libya . ''
The United States considers the Libyan opposition group the Transitional National Council worthy of U.S. support , but has not formally recognized the group , Ambassador to Libya Gene Cretz said <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2011-04-27">Wednesday</TIMEX3> .
But Cretz said the lack of formal recognition has not stopped the United States from aiding and supporting the opposition .
A three - member panel arrived in Libya on <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2011-04-27">Wednesday</TIMEX3> to begin a U.N.-ordered inquiry into reports of violence and human rights abuses .
The team , led by Professor Cherif Bassiouni , an Egyptian jurist and war crimes expert , was sent by the Human Rights Council .
<TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2011-03">Last month</TIMEX3> , the U.N. General Assembly suspended Libya 's membership in the Human Rights Council .
The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2011-04-27">Wednesday</TIMEX3> it has established an international aid presence in Tripoli , with humanitarian workers also in Benghazi and the neighboring countries of Tunisia , Egypt , Chad and Niger .
Aid agencies are seeking about $ 310 million for relief operations and have received $ 129 million , the U.N. office said .
Also <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2011-04-27">Wednesday</TIMEX3> , government officials took reporters to the city of Tarhuna , south of Tripoli , where they said civilians were volunteering to be trained to defend Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi from NATO .
At a training camp there , reporters observed civilians learning basic military skills .
Some of the volunteers appeared to be as young as 15 years old , the reporters said .
Building frequented by Gadhafi hit NATO is leading an international military operation in Libya that includes airstrikes targeting Gadhafi 's military resources .
It is operating under a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing any means necessary -- with the exception of foreign occupation -- to protect civilians .
Witnesses said three people were killed and several were wounded after government shells detonated <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2011-04-26">Tuesday</TIMEX3> near a refugee camp in the critical port area .
Thousands of migrants have been housed there as they wait for ships to carry them to safety .
Opposition forces said they believe that , had NATO forces not intervened with air attacks <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="TIME" value="2011-04-26TNI">Tuesday night</TIMEX3> , the shelling would have continued .
NATO said six military vehicles , seven technical vehicles and a surface - to - air missile launcher were targeted on <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2011-04-26">Tuesday</TIMEX3> in the vicinity of Misrata .
Though Gadhafi 's regime said <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2011-W16">last week</TIMEX3> that it was going to suspend operations in Misrata and let tribes deal with the rebels , heavy shelling suggests pro - government forces are n't done with the city .
As many as 1,500 migrants are believed to remain in Misrata in need of evacuation , IOM said .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent weeks</TIMEX3> , nearly 626,000 people have abandoned Libya for Tunisia , Egypt , Niger , Algeria , Chad and Sudan , it said .
Some 615,000 people , including large numbers of third - country nationals , have fled Libya , more than 10,000 from Misrata .
Misrata , the third - largest city in the North African country , has been hemmed in on three sides by Gadhafi 's forces .
Though rebels said they had gained control of the city 's center and had pushed government forces outside the city , they said Gadhafi 's forces were continuing to attack Misrata with heavy weaponry .
The port has served as a crucial route of escape and as a lifeline to humanitarian aid .
