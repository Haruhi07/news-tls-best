Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Libyan government forces fired a missile at an Italian warship in the Mediterranean Sea on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2011-08-03">Wednesday</TIMEX3> in a rare attack on the NATO fleet offshore , a government spokesman said .
The frigate Bersagliere was about 19 kilometers -LRB- 12 miles -RRB- off the Libyan city of Zlitan when the missile fell harmlessly into the sea about 2 km away , the Italian defense ministry and NATO reported .
` ` The ship was not harmed and continued on its mission , '' NATO said in a statement .
` ` NATO ships go in harm 's way to seek those military targets which continue to threaten the people of Libya . ''
In Tripoli , government spokesman Musa Ibrahim told reporters that the missile had been launched by troops that remain loyal to longtime Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi .
` ` We have amazing capabilities that we have not felt that we need to use , '' Ibrahim said .
` ` Our army is still very strong .
We have n't used our real military power . ''
He discounted allied claims that pro - Gadhafi forces had been reduced to 20 % of their capabilities , adding , ` ` For God 's sake , if we are down here to 20 % , what am I doing here ? ''
Gadhafi 's forces have been battling a nearly six - month - long revolt that has split Libya roughly in half .
