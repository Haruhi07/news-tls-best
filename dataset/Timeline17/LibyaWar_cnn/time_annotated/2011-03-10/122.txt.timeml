Old friends : Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez -LRB- left -RRB- meets Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi in a tent in Tripoli , <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2004">2004</TIMEX3> .
Gadhafi 's overseas backing is based on a shared anti - colonial narrative , say analysts
Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez says Gadhafi , ` ` has been my friend for a long time '' China , Russia and Turkey would not support an invasion or no - fly zone , says analyst -LRB- CNN -RRB- --
Despite facing intense pressure from parts of the international community to relinquish power , the Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi can still count on the continued support of some prominent world leaders , say analysts .
Much of Gadhafi 's overseas backing is based on a shared anti - colonial narrative and the instincts of some regimes to undermine the norms of the international community , experts believe .
So while many countries have criticized Gadhafi in the aftermath of protests that have left more than 1,000 people dead and many more injured , according to the U.N. , some of his allies , including Venezuela and Zimbabwe , refuse to publicly criticize Libya .
` ` There is a natural alignment between all regimes which are into power maximization , that is , regimes trying to accumulate as much power as they can for themselves , '' says Barak Seener , a Middle East research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute , a London - based think tank .
Who is the opposition in Libya ?
` ` Venezuela , for example , also has close links with Iran , '' added Seener .
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has called for an international good will commission to mediate in Libya ; in contrast the U.N. Security Council over <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-W09-WE">the weekend</TIMEX3> voted for tough restrictions and possible war crimes charges against the Libyan regime .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2011-03-07">Monday</TIMEX3> , Chavez said Gadhafi , ` ` has been my friend and our friend for a long time , '' in remarks broadcast on Venezuelan state television .
And in comments made on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-03-10">Thursday</TIMEX3> , Chavez described alleged preparations to invade Libya as ` ` a madness , and in front of that madness , as always , the Yankee empire that tries to dominate the world , at the cost of fire and blood . ''
The former Cuban President Fidel Castro on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2011-03-10">Thursday</TIMEX3> also condemned what he described as the inevitable U.S.-backed invasion of Libya by NATO to get its hands on that country 's oil .
Seener said that countries with a record of ` ` domestic abuse , '' such as limiting freedom of speech and having no independent judiciary , have no sense of accountability to their people in the same way that elected powers do and that lack of perceived accountability tends to spill over into their foreign polices .
Another close allay of Gadhafi is Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe .
Libya has good relations with Zimbabwe , which has few international friends , says Jane Kinninmont , senior research fellow at the think tank Chatham House .
` ` She notes the contrast with Sudan , which was able to count on a far broader range of allies , including China and most of the Arab world , when it faced condemnation from the West over the ethnic conflict in Darfur '' .
She adds that , for example , during the bloody ethnic conflict in the Sudanese region of Darfur , Sudan faced international condemnation but ` ` did still have its friends in the international world . ''
There is also a second group of nations -- including China , Russia and Turkey -- which while unlikely to openly back Gadhafi , would not support an invasion and they would also be against a no - fly zone , said Seener .
` ` It is not simply a case of being anti - Western .
Turkey for example is increasing diplomatic and economic links with Iran and as it does so it is entering the Iranian sphere of influence .
They will not condemn what Gadhafi is doing in Libya , '' says Seener .
Despite the continued backing of Gadhafi by his allies , some analysts predict a sorry end for the leader .
Scott Horton , an international lawyer said : ` ` Deposed dictators <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> are subject to lawsuits , both civil suits by the governments that succeeded them and human rights suits , and they wind up being prosecuted and successfully sued . ''
However , Barak Barfi of the New America Foundation said : ` ` I think there is a very good possibility he 'll fight to the death knowing he has very few options . ''
