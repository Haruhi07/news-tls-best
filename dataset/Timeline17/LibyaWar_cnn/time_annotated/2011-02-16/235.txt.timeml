-LRB- CNN -RRB- --
Unprecedented demonstrations sweeping the Middle East and North Africa spread <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2011-02-16">Wednesday</TIMEX3> to Libya , where police clashed with anti - government protesters in the coastal city of Benghazi , an independent source told CNN .
About 200 protesters came out to show support for human rights activist and lawyer Fathi Terbil , who had been detained earlier , the source said .
Several people were arrested after police confronted the protesters , the source added .
But Libya -- ruled by Moammar Gadhafi since <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="1969">1969</TIMEX3> -- is not Egypt , said a highly placed Libyan source close to the government who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to talk to the media .
` ` There is nothing serious here , '' he said .
` ` These are just young people fighting each other . ''
Driven by discontent and fueled by social media , protests in the region spread <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2011-W07">this week</TIMEX3> not just to Libya but to Iran and Bahrain .
Anti - government sentiment has also manifested itself on the streets of Algeria , Jordan , Syria and Yemen .
In Yemen , Sanaa University students protested <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-02-16">Wednesday</TIMEX3> , calling for an improved curriculum , but the demonstration rapidly morphed into an anti - government stand .
Participants said government supporters outside the university gates hurled rocks , but the situation stayed under control .
It was at least the sixth day that scuffles had broken out between the government 's supporters and foes .
Activist Abdul Rahman Barman said three anti - government protesters were injured when government supporters attacked them after the demonstration .
One had to be hospitalized for head injuries , he said .
Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh has been in power for <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P32Y">32 years</TIMEX3> but has pledged not to run for re - election when his <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> term ends in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2013">2013</TIMEX3> .
In nearby Bahrain , thousands of people marched in a peaceful funeral procession for Ali Abdulhadi Mushaima , who was killed when clashes erupted during the funeral for another protester .
They camped out at the Pearl Roundabout , a landmark in the capital , Manama , that has been adopted by protesters as their Tahrir Square , the epicenter of Egypt 's revolution .
A massive pearl sits at the apex of a circle of inward - sweeping arches , and <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2011-02-16">Wednesday</TIMEX3> , Bahrainis camped out at its base and painted anti - government slogans .
Later in the day , flag - waving pro - government demonstrators were out in Manama and the second largest city of Muharraq .
New York Times journalist Nicholas Kristof said security forces have backed off after ` ` a concerted deliberate effort to use a truly stunning amount of force . ''
` ` <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> that the regime has backed off , it 's a little hard to say where things will go , ''
Kristof told CNN .
` ` It is possible that ... there will be some kind of truce and agreement to have more democracy , some more concessions . ''
Large crowds showed up for a funeral as well in the Iranian capital , where 26 - year - old Saneh Jaleh was laid to rest .
Iranian authorities said Jaleh belonged to the pro - government Basij militia and was shot to death by the outlawed People 's Mujahedeen of Iran .
But some of Jaleh 's acquaintances disputed that account , and Jaleh 's funeral strangely drew both supporters and foes of the Islamic regime , which has cracked down on dissent even though it publicly praised Egyptians for toppling President Hosni Mubarak .
International journalists are barred from covering Iran 's unrest , but a protester told CNN that police fired tear gas and beat people with batons .
Sara , whose full name has been withheld for security reasons , said she was risking her safety to march on the streets because Jaleh was part of Iran 's reformist Green Movement .
` ` We are not allowing his blood to go to waste , '' she said .
` ` I am doing this for him . ''
In the place that gave rise to the spirit of the region 's freedom movement , changes were still slowly unfolding .
Tunisia lifted its midnight - until-<TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="TIME" value="2011-02-16T04:00">4 a.m.</TIMEX3> curfew , though a state of emergency remains intact , the state - run Tunis Afrique Presse said .
Weeks of demonstrations forced the ouster of longtime President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2011-01">January</TIMEX3> .
` ` Tunisia <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> after the revolution of its population is <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> searching for its independence , '' said Lazhar Samali , an engineer who protested against the government .
` ` It 's a sovereign state , and Tunisia has in its own hands its destiny . ''
The end of Ben Ali 's 23 - year rule inspired Egyptians , and then others , to rise up for their rights .
<TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2011-02-11">Last Friday</TIMEX3> , after <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DURATION" value="P18D">18 days</TIMEX3> of mass demonstrations in Egypt , Mubarak stepped down , leaving the nation in the hands of its powerful military .
