Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- --
Fresh explosions rang out <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-05-24" mod="START">early Tuesday</TIMEX3> near Tripoli , hours after South African President Jacob Zuma held talks with Moammar Gadhafi and signalled he was ready to accept an African Union plan for a cease - fire .
<TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="TIME" value="2011-05-24T12:45" mod="APPROX">Around 12:45 a.m.
Tuesday</TIMEX3> , a pair of large blasts were heard <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="PT5M" mod="APPROX">about five minutes</TIMEX3> apart , as jets flew over the capital of Tripoli .
A Libyan government official said the first strike hit Abu Sita , a former military turned construction site about 10 kilometers -LRB- 6 miles -RRB- from the city center .
There was no immediate indication of where the second explosion occurred .
Nor was there an immediate response from NATO , which has conducted regular strikes as part of its stated mission to halt Libyan leader Gadhafi 's forces from killing innocent civilians .
Hours before the blasts , Zuma emerged from a meeting with the longtime Libyan strongman convinced that Gadhafi was ready for an end to hostilities , including such airstrikes and the ongoing fight with the Benghazi - based opposition movement .

But he gave no indication that Gadhafi was prepared to step aside , as rebel leaders have insisted is their primary demand .
Libya opposition : ` We really need money ' Ragtag rebels holding down Zintan ` ` Brother leader took the position <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2011-05-30">today</TIMEX3> that he is ready to implement the decision of the AU -LRB- that -RRB- there must be a cease - fire , '' Zuma told a scrum of reporters on the tarmac at Tripoli 's Mitiga International Airport before boarding a jet .
` ` The view is that that must include -- bombing by NATO must also come to an end , '' he said in the news conference , which was broadcast on Libyan state television .
Zuma added that Gadhafi said any cease - fire must apply to all parties , ` ` but also , he makes the point that : Let the Libyan people be given a chance to talk among themselves .
And therefore , he 's ready to implement the road map of the AU . ''
Unlike some other world leaders , Zuma has not called for the longtime Libyan leader to step down .
Neither has Zuma 's African National Congress party nor the African Union , which he was representing and which Gadhafi once led .
In fact , the AU has criticized the NATO airstrikes .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2011-04">April</TIMEX3> , Zuma led an AU delegation to Tripoli , where hopes were raised briefly when it was announced that Gadhafi had agreed , in principle , to the African Union 's ` ` road map '' proposal for peace .

But Gadhafi continued his attacks and the Libyan opposition rejected the proposal because it did not meet its demand that he give up the power he has held for <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P42Y">42 years</TIMEX3> .
A government official said Libyan Prime Minister Al - Baghdadi Ali al - Mahmudi also attended <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2011-05-30">Monday</TIMEX3> 's meeting .
Baghdadi greeted Zuma upon his arrival at the airport , where dozens of Gadhafi supporters carried posters , some of which said , ` ` <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2011-05">May</TIMEX3> the leader be victorious '' and ` ` Thanks for great Africa . ''
The African Union has helped mediate peace talks before , including ones in Kenya and Zimbabwe that left the ruling powers in control .
It was not clear whether Zuma used the opportunity to press Gadhafi for information on the whereabouts of South African freelance photographer Anton Hammerl .
Hammerl has been missing in Libya since <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2011-04">April</TIMEX3> and is believed dead .
South Africa has said it got assurances from Libya that the journalist was alive .
But a Libyan government spokesman has said his whereabouts were unknown .
` ` We never had him with us at any stage , '' spokesman Musa Ibrahim has said .
The meeting came as Gadhafi 's grip on power appeared to continue to loosen .
Eight generals from his army have defected to Italy , the Italian Foreign Ministry told CNN <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2011-05-30">Monday</TIMEX3> .
The generals were accompanied by more than 100 Libyan soldiers , a senior Italian official with firsthand knowledge of , and responsibility for , the operation said .
The Libyans crossed their country 's border into Tunisia , where they were met by Italian intelligence agents , the official said .
Italy announced <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2011-05-30">Monday</TIMEX3> that it will open a consulate <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2011-05-31">Tuesday</TIMEX3> in the rebel - held eastern city of Benghazi .
Also <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2011-05-30">Monday</TIMEX3> , the first locally based television station to operate in Libya since the start of the revolution was to begin broadcasting from the rebel stronghold of Benghazi .
The station was founded by Momammed Nabus , who later was one of five journalists killed in the conflict .
` ` Gadhafi forces assassinated him for highlighting to the rest of the world the atrocities committed by the Gadhafi regime , '' said Zuheir Al - Barasi , who was to open the station 's broadcast from the city 's courthouse .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent weeks</TIMEX3> , Gadhafi has been seen in public only rarely as NATO has stepped up attacks against his sprawling Bab el - Azizia compound .
NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2011-05-30">Monday</TIMEX3> that Gadhafi 's ` ` reign of terror is coming to an end . ''
` ` He is increasingly isolated at home and abroad , '' Rasmussen said during a speech in Bulgaria .
` ` Even those closest to him are departing , defecting or deserting . ''
Rasmussen also said NATO has made ` ` significant progress '' in its Libya operation .
NATO said <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2011-05-30">Monday</TIMEX3> it has conducted 3,385 strike sorties in Libya since <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2011-03">March</TIMEX3> .
` ` We have seriously degraded Gadhafi 's ability to kill his own people , '' Rasmussen said in his speech .
` ` We have prevented more massacres in Misrata and elsewhere across the country , and we are saving lives <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EVERY">every day</TIMEX3> . ''
The NATO - led bombing campaign began in <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2011-03">March</TIMEX3> after the U.N. Security Council authorized the use of any means necessary -- short of occupation -- to protect civilians from attacks by Gadhafi 's forces .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2011-05-29">Sunday</TIMEX3> , Libyan opposition forces continued to fend off attacks near the rebel - held port city of Misrata .

But rebel leader Mustafa Abdul Jalil said over <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2011-W21-WE">the weekend</TIMEX3> that the opposition movement is running out of money even as it has achieved key victories militarily and diplomatically .
` ` We are going through a financial crisis , '' said Jalil , chairman of the Benghazi - based National Transitional Council .
In a speech in Geneva , Switzerland , the United Nations ' top human rights official noted <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="2011-05-30">Monday</TIMEX3> ` ` the brutality and magnitude of measures '' taken by the Libyan government .
The government 's actions have been ` ` shocking , '' United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said , criticizing the ` ` outright disregard for basic human rights . ''
