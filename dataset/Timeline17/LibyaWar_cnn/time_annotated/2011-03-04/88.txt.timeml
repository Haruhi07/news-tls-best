I urge you , that either you or the UN or the Prosecutor of the International Court of Justice issue a warning ASAP to Gaddafi 's pilots and army that they will be individually held responsible for any civilian deaths and charged with crimes against humanity .
Secondly , a no fly zone over Libya should be declared ASAP .
Gaddafi has all the money in the world to finance mercenary armies and pilots as China and India are continuing importing Libyan oil , with payments going to Gaddafi 's regime .
Thirdly , the UN should resolve to send in UN troops to Libya to stop the civil war and to allow the people of Libya to decide their own future .
The world ca n't just stand by when there is a totally unequal David and Goliath struggle unfolding in Libya between the rag - tag army of revolutionaries and Gaddafi 's well equipped professional killers .
It 's the duty of the world to prevent the massacre of the civilian freedom fighters of Libya , as it happened in the <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="1956">1956</TIMEX3> Hungarian Revolution .
There too , the revolution started as a peaceful demonstration against the tyrannical regime .
People only took up arms there too after State Security Police shot at them .
The revolutionaries held out for <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="P1W" mod="MORE_THAN">over a week</TIMEX3> , but the overwhelming force of the invading Soviet army , comparable to Gaddafi 's reliance on external professional mercenaries , squashed the revolution , killing over <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2500">2500</TIMEX3> freedom fighters .
Let this not happen in Libya !

No Andris , neither the U.S. nor the U.N. have ant business interfering in the internal affairs of Libya .
We need to let the Libyans decide their own future and the way to do that is to adopt a ` ` laissez - fair '' policy .
Not all Libyans want Qadaffi gone despite all the propaganda spewed by the right - wing news media ! ! !
