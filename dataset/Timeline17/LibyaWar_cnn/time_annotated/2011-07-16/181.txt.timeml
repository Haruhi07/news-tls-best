BENGHAZI Middle Eastern autocrats routinely warn their people of rivers of blood , Western occupation , poverty , chaos , and Al Qaeda if their regimes are toppled .
Those threats were heard in Tunisia , Egypt , Yemen , Bahrain , Syria , and rendered in black - comedy style in Libya .
But there is a strong belief across the region that the costs of removing autocracies , as high as they might be , are low compared to the damage inflicted by the <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> rulers .
In short , freedom is worth the price .
In Libya , four scenarios may negatively affect prospects for democratization : civil\/tribal war , military rule , becoming stuck in transition , and partition .
Given the high price Libyans have paid , those scenarios should be prevented rather than cured .
The civil\/tribal war scenario is the worst risk .
Egypt s
revolutionaries understood this .
When sectarian violence erupted there following the removal of Hosni Mubarak , the revolutionary coalitions adopted the slogan , You won t gloat over this , Mubarak .
Repressive dictatorships can not win free and fair elections .
But they can use extreme violence to consolidate their control over the state , its people and its institutions .
So , to win , Libya s Colonel Moammar Gadhafi has deliberately and successfully turned a civil - resistance campaign into an armed conflict .
That will have ramifications in the post - authoritarian context .
A study published by Columbia University on civil resistance has shown that the probability of a country relapsing into civil war following a successful anti - dictatorship armed campaign is 43 % , versus 28 % when the campaign is unarmed .
According to the same study , which was based on 323 cases of armed and unarmed opposition campaigns between <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="1900">1900</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2006">2006</TIMEX3> , the likelihood of democratic transition within <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P5Y">five years</TIMEX3> following a successful armed opposition campaign is only 3 % , compared to 51 % when campaigns were unarmed .
Libya , of course , can survive the gloomy prospect of post - authoritarian civil war .
But this requires containing tribal and regional polarization , as well as the rivalries between the Interim National Council -LRB- INC -RRB- and the Military Council -LRB- MC -RRB- , and between senior military commanders .
Violent polarization has developed not only between Eastern and Western tribes , but also between some of the Western tribes .
<TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2011-06">Last month</TIMEX3> , for example , armed clashes erupted between rebels in al - Zintan and the villagers of al - Rayyaniya , 15 kilometers away .
Six people were killed a reminder of what can happen if violent polarization continues between neighboring towns and villages .
Vendetta politics is not unknown in Libya , and , in an armed society comprising more than 120 tribes including around 30 with significant numbers and resources it can become extremely dangerous .
Another negative scenario is military rule .
Several figures from the free officers the group that plotted the <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="1969">1969</TIMEX3> coup against the monarchy are leading the INC . .
They include General Abd al - Fattah Younis , General Soliman Mahmoud , Colonel Khalifa Haftar , Major Mohamed Najm , and others .
Those figures hold a mix of historical legitimacy , for participating in the <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="1969">1969</TIMEX3> coup , and <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> legitimacy , for helping <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2012-02-17">the 17th February</TIMEX3> revolution .
They also belong to several large tribes , guaranteeing wide tribal representation if a military council were to take power , as in Egypt .
Unlike Egypt , however , whoever takes power in Libya will not necessarily inherit poor economic conditions that could threaten their legitimacy and undermine their popularity .
This might lead a group of senior officers to rule directly , especially if victory in Libya comes militarily .

A move by army officers in Tripoli against Gadhafi and his sons might end the conflict , with military commanders getting the credit and the political capital .
But <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DURATION" value="P4DE">four decades</TIMEX3> of military - based dictatorship may be enough for Libyans , a majority of whom never really benefited from their country s wealth or potential .
When it comes to producing terrorists and undocumented immigrants two critical issues for Europe Arab military dictators have an inglorious record .
Algeria in the <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="1990">1990</TIMEX3> s is a potent reminder of this , and Western governments do not want the vicious cycle of repressive autocrats producing violent theocrats and refugees to restart .
Getting ` ` stuck in transition '' Getting stuck in transition is a third possible scenario , with Libya remaining in a gray zone neither a fully - fledged democracy nor a dictatorship , but semi - free .
This means regular elections , a democratic constitution , and civil society , coupled with electoral fraud , skewed representation , human rights violations , and restrictions on civil liberties .
Getting stuck in transition usually kills the momentum for democratic change , and widespread corruption , weak state institutions , and lack of security serve to reinforce a myth of the just autocrat .
Vladimir Putin s rule in Russia illustrates this outcome .
Unfortunately , a study published in the Journal of Democracy showed that out of the 100 countries that were designated in transition between <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="1970">1970</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2000">2000</TIMEX3> , only 20 became fully democratic -LRB- for example , Chile , Argentina , Poland , and Taiwan -RRB- .
Five relapsed into brutal dictatorships -LRB- including Uzbekistan , Algeria , Turkmenistan , and Belarus -RRB- , while the rest were stuck somewhere in transition .
Given Libya s lack of democratic experience , some view this as a likely outcome in the post - Gadhafi era .
But Libya is not the only country that has tried to move from dictatorship to democracy with weak institutions and strong tribal identities .
Albania , Mongolia , and India successfully passed more complicated tests and offer some useful lessons in democratic transitions under unfavourable conditions .
The fourth scenario is partition , with the old three - province , Ottoman - style setup commonly mentioned : Cyrenaica -LRB- east -RRB- , Fezzan -LRB- south -RRB- , and Tripolitania -LRB- west -RRB- .
Cyrenaica is Gadhafi - free , Tripolitania is not , and Fezzan did not fully join the revolution .

But the administrative borders of these districts were never fully established , and they have changed at least eight times since <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="1951">1951</TIMEX3> .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2007">2007</TIMEX3> , Libya had 22 sha biya -LRB- administrative districts -RRB- , not three .
All of these scenarios will be affected by outcomes in Egypt and Tunisia .
In the case of democratic transitions , a success nearby often helps at home .

Either country , or both , could offer Libya successful transition models , erecting an important obstacle to military dictatorship or civil war .

The above may be quite true in Yemen and in fact , is but in Libya it 's a different story .
What the people in the right - wing news media wo n't and never will talk about is the way Mohammar Qadaffy greatly helped the Libyan people after the <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="1969">1969</TIMEX3> revolution .
For instance , the litteracy rate in Libya was 15 % in <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="1970">1970</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2011-07-16">today</TIMEX3> is 85 % while the poor gradually became less poor and hospitals , bridges and schools were built which otherwise would not have happened under King Idris .
If the ` ` rebels '' triumph there with the help of NATO , Libya will only degenerate into another pro - Western Arab police state ! !

With so many tribes that are scattered all over Libya , there would be tribal conflicts , if unity is unthinkable .
Also an internal struggle between former members of the regime within the Transitional National Council and the Military Council could break out , if no consensus can be reached .

The head of the rebellion could sign the treaty giving them land in the East next to the borders of Egypt with Benghazi as their capital city and Gaddafi having the land to the West next to the borders of Algeria and Tunisia with Tripoli as his capital city .
Thus , giving both the rebels freedom and democracy they desire and Gaddafi control and rule he desires .
With this peace agreement , this will end the conflict and the Libyan economy will not be affected .

Why no comparison to the dreadful experience in Iraq , with which the Libyan war bears so many similarities -- intervention based on lies , a relatively prosperous country ruled by someone deemed a ` ` bad guy '' by the West , and the fact that both countries did not have to answer to the IMF .
Also , whereas the Egypt and Tunisia revolts had partcipation from large numbers of protestors , the rebels\/insurgents in Libya were and remain a small minority -- and the revolt or civil war only exists because of foreign\/Nato intervention .

Ignoring the fact that a large majority support the <TIMEX3 tid="t236" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> gov ' t or want nothing to do with the Nato rebels would also appear worth mentioning .

If you are going to use an interrogative , you must use a question mark .
` ` Also , whereas the Egypt and Tunisia ... ''
You began a sentence with the adverb , ` ` Also , '' another grammatical error . '' .

Ignoring the fact ... ''
You just had to use the word ` fact ' without citing a source .
Such citations are called ` opinions , ' for no majority threatened with public executions , torture , and beheading , will become the vocal majority until the rebels that you so blithely dismiss have their voices heard without their throats being cut .
Unfortunately , you have supplied us with another predictable , poorly worded , anti - American rant .

You apparently overlooked all of the other posts in this thread as , with few exceptions , they all contain errors of some sort .

The need for brevity , combined with haste , often results in less - than - perfect blog posts !
-RRB- .
By the way , there is nothing ` ` anti - American '' about facing the realities of intervention in foreign countries -- our <TIMEX3 tid="t247" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> errors should not be blindly repeated .
Lastly , I do not ` ` blithely dismiss '' the rebels\/insurgents in Libya .
It is the Libyan people who do not support them , whether you like it or not .
There are plenty of videos in <TIMEX3 tid="t248" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent weeks</TIMEX3> of massive demonstrations against Nato and in favor of the <TIMEX3 tid="t250" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> Libyan gov ` t. Can you point us to anything which shows that the rebels\/terrorists\/insurgents have broad popular support -LRB- within Libya , that is , and not in Nato capitals -RRB- ?

You brought up the subject .
the burden of proof is on you .
What you do is typical of those in support of islmaic dictatorships and terrorism .
You repeat the manta , ` ` Everyone else does it . ''
You did the same erroneous cop - out with grammar .
Rather than stay on the subjet to face your own mistakes , you pointed to the errors of others to rationalize your own .

Jjust someone does n't agree with you does n't mean they support islamic dictatorships and terrorism .
I think it is a fair question to ask just where is the support that the rebels have ...
We are told that they represent the Libyan people but they seem to be a small minority .
If the US is trying to support a group that even the Libyans do n't want then we are only causing trouble .

It was one of comparison .
To believe that Libya has anything less than a razor to the throat of Libyans is naive in the extreme .
Qaddafi has never lost an election .
His image is everywhere .
There is no public dissent -- none .
Rather disingenuous to propose that for <TIMEX3 tid="t267" type="DURATION" value="P40Y">forty years</TIMEX3> , the whole populace has been of one opinion .
CNN doers not report Libyans themselves , en mass , opposing the rebels , other than Big Brother soundbites .
