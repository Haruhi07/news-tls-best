President Obama is set to defend U.S. military involvement in Libya to Congress as soon as <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2011-06-15">today</TIMEX3> , according to the White House .
Congressional sources are expecting a written report answering a number of questions the House of Representatives posed in a resolution passed with bipartisan support <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-W23" mod="MORE_THAN">over a week ago</TIMEX3> , including inquiries about the president s goal in Libya , how he hopes to achieve that goal , why he has not sought congressional authorization for involving U.S. troops abroad and how much the conflict will ultimately cost .
White House spokesman Tommy Vietor said the report will address a whole host of issues about our ongoing efforts in Libya , including those raised in the House resolution as well as our legal analysis with regard to the War Powers Resolution .
Many members of congress Democrats and Republicans accuse the president of flouting the War Powers Resolution , which says the president can involve U.S. troops abroad for <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P60D">60 days</TIMEX3> without congressional authorization but must withdraw them within another <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P30D">30 days</TIMEX3> without a congressional okay .
The White House maintains it is acting in accordance with the law .
The report to congress follows a letter Speaker John Boehner sent to President Obama <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2011-06-14">Tuesday</TIMEX3> warning him that he will be in violation of the War Powers resolution come <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2011-06-10">Friday</TIMEX3> , <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="P90D">90 days</TIMEX3> after U.S. involvement in the Libya conflict began , though Vietor says the response was already in the works ahead of Boehner s letter to the president .
Barry is a warmonger , he sent 100,000 + troops to Afghanistan looking for OBL .
Two copters and a couple of seals is all we needed .
Let me make a suggestion , impeach .

No you need to learn terms like Neo - Con and repugs and rethuglicans ...
that is what the benevolent party that embraces all points of vies does ...
You have to learn how to blame the previous administration and supprt spending more money than the government makes ... to get Cina to believe that you have already defaulted and to get moodys to threaten to downgrade this countrys credit rating . .
thus affecting the intrest rate we pay on all that borrowed money .

He 's deployed more troops than Bush ever had .

I grew up thinking it took an act of Congress to declare war , and a military incursion into sovereign countries without first declaring war is in itself an act justifying the declaration of war .
What we have had all along are a bunch of chickenhawks pandering to the military industrial complex but terrified to actually declare war .
What justification would we have needed to invade Vietnam , Grenada , Iraq , Afghanistan , and others ?
Were the USA to actually declare war , we 'd have to gain the support of Americans first .
This bunch of spineless cowards know nothing but sleazy politics and would never risk anything by committing to a real war .
It breaks my heart to see Americans volunteer to act like lawless marauders under the guise of ` ` saving the world and the USA . ''
But in the end , it 's not the military men and women who committed the crimes , it 's the so - called leadership that will do anything to avoid personal responsibility .
The Vietnam - era vets have every right to storm and take out our central government for the crimes they ' ve committed against Americans .

Because even if Clinton did fail to get Osama Bin Laden , Bush as President and Commander - in - Chief had a choice about how to respond to 9 - 11 .
He CHOSE to declare war and sent troops into Afghanistan .
He had other choices , like do nothing , a more limited response , use covert\/special ops and air power only , etc . .
As for IRAQ , that had absolutely nothing to do with 9 - 11 and took much needed resources AWAY from Afghanistan .
Iraq could have totally been avoided .
Both of those wars were already in play when Pres .
Obama took office .

the president ca n't declare war ...
only congress can ... and they at least voted to support the action initially ... as for the teleprompter ... who knows ...

You can blame Bush all you want , but there is only one President and he needs to own up to the fact that his policies are hurting America .

He did n't plan 9\/11 but his response leaves much to be desired .
Instead of going for OBL where he was known to be and sticking to it , he diverted his attention to Iraq because he knew Afghanistan was going to be one long hard haul .
He did n't care about catching OBL just whipping someone 's fanny and saying ` ` Mission Accomplished '' .
From a salesman 's point of view it is called bait and switch .
As we all know Iraq did n't turn out as easy as he thought it would either .

our founding fathers were socialist .
I am proudly one too .
The government is authorized by the constitution to levy taxes to pay for programs the government sees as benefiting the citizens welfare and provide for their security .
These programs do not benefit just certain members of society , but the majority of citizens .
Our tax system was set up to be a socialist system that what we contribute is for the benefit of all citizens .
The founding fathers designed programs such as public roads , bridges , libraries , postal system , and fire stations these were designed by the founding fathers to benefit all citizens .
Taxes were collected to make these public works the property of all our citizens ...
therefore yes we are both a socialist and capitalistic society .
Furthermore , there is nothing in the constitution that would stop future presidents or congress from expanding and creating new socialist or capitalist programs that would benefit the welfare of our citizens .

Oh that 's right !

He was too busy focusing on Iraq , who had nothing to do with 9\/11 .

As for your incorrect figures , President Obama has sent approximately 30,000 of the 100,000 + American and foreign troops in Afghanistan , the remainder were sent by President Bush , and other countries .
President Obama may have sent more troops than were originally there , which may have aided in bagging OBL , and I bet he will be the one bringing those troops home .

Bush did n't go into Afghanistan like he should have to find OBL , he split our forces to go into Iraq when they had nothing to do with 9\/11 -LRB- and no , there were no WMD either -RRB- and has put us into <TIMEX3 tid="t421" type="DURATION" value="P1DE">a decade</TIMEX3> of war that has helped to wreck many lives but also our economy .

8 of the Constitution says that ` ` Congress shall have the power ... to declare War . ''
That means the president has authority to decide exactly how we fight after Congress decides who and when .
Madison , Hamilton and Jay in the Federalist Papers explained that this division of power is one of the main things distinguishing our president from a king .
Even Senator Obama , just <TIMEX3 tid="t593" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">a few years ago</TIMEX3> , said he agreed that the president may not legally get us into war without Congress .
The <TIMEX3 tid="t597" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> president , unlike even Bush , is claiming that he does n't need Congress ' permission to send US troops into danger .
If we tolerate that stance , we ' ve destroyed another part of the Constitution in direct defiance of something our Founders specifically warned us not to do .
So , if the president refuses to withdraw our troops and does n't get authorization , we need to either immediately force withdrawal or begin impeachment .
Do n't accept any explanation about how this is n't a ` ` real '' war , if it includes US troops risking their lives and shooting at people .
The Constitution offers no such excuse .

This is diifficult to explain since the only purpose of NATO is to defend NATO members if they are attacked by a non - NATO country .
Libya is not a member of NATO and did not attack a NATO country -LRB-
it was a civil war -RRB- .
There is no way to justify NATO doing anything against Libya .
Just because the U.N. gave the O.K. to NATO does not justify NATO going against its charter and getting involved in Libya .
It is even worse when Congress did not give the O.K. because this is not a justifiable NATO action .
Obama will give a song and a dance -LRB- what he is good at -RRB- but will not be able to justify going into Libya as a NATO action .

When the Libyan conflict began many politicians , mostly Republicans , called President Obama out for not being fast enough and not jumping right in unilaterally and bombing Libya .
McCain and many others were on the air calling for the US to create the no - fly space on its own .
All of this would have been very expensive but more important it would have put the US in another war like Afghanistan and Iraq .
So , the President uses good judgement and goes into this conflict sharing the responsibility with NATO .
<TIMEX3 tid="t775" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> the congress is complaining again and trying to put a political spin on it .
Making points with national security is pretty low .
Do they want the US to withdraw their support from NATO in Libya ?
That would make America look weak , like flip - floppers and lose a lot of respect around the world . .
What do these congressmen really hope to gain from this embarassing law suit ? .
Do n't they know that these things are watched by many people around the world ?

Secondly , president Obama completed what we supposedly went into Afghanistan to do <TIMEX3 tid="t824" type="DATE" value="2001">10 years ago</TIMEX3> and that was to kill OBL .

And I may add that this delicate mission was completed successfully without the lost of lives amongst US troops and Pakistan civilians .
Secondly , president Obama set a deadline to start the withdrawal of our troops from the GOP 's illegitimate Iraqi war and he has followed through on his pledged promise as US troop withdrawal from Iraq began <TIMEX3 tid="t830" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">several months ago</TIMEX3> .
When congress voted for the war powers act in <TIMEX3 tid="t832" type="DATE" value="2003">2003</TIMEX3> , it did so in accordance with United Nations mandate for Iraq to disarm and give up its war arsenal .
However what that war powers act did not authorize was for George W. Bush , John Boehner and the Republican Party to create a scheme and lie and mislead the American people , the UN and the world community about bogus and non existent weapons of mass destruction in Iraq , dragging us into a bloody and senseless war that may last for decades to come .
And what the <TIMEX3 tid="t836" type="DATE" value="2003">2003</TIMEX3> war powers act did not authorize was for George W. Bush and the Republican Party to prematurely withdraw UN inspectors from Iraq by force to start their illegitimate Iraqi war .
During this UN mission , both long and short range Iraqi missiles were being destroyed before the world eyes each and <TIMEX3 tid="t837" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EVERY">every day</TIMEX3> by UN inspectors and the Iraqi war arsenal was being made inefficient and obselete without bloodshed and lost of life .
Subsequently , Iraq was no longer a threat to its neighbors and neither was it an immenent threat to the United States .
However , the dictator and war criminal George W. Bush , John Boehner and his Republican Party violated American and international law by prematurely removing UN inspectors from Iraq by force to start their illegitimate Iraqi war .
The result is 4,000 plus dead US troops and half a million Iraqi civilians dead to date .
But <TIMEX3 tid="t838" type="DATE" value="2013">ten years later</TIMEX3> , no one is yet to call for the impeachment and imprisonment of George W. Bush , John Boehner and the Republican party .
And what has president Obama done wrong in his handling of the Libyan crisis ?
Has any American lives been lost in the Libyan conflict ?
Have we committed ground troops to the Libyan conflict ?
Are we actually involved in the conflict at this moment or just proving logistic support to NATO ?
and is president Obama hurting our economy by supporting the UN mandated Libyan Mission ?
I may add that <TIMEX3 tid="t841" type="DATE" value="2011-06-15">today</TIMEX3> we are spending 11 billion US dollars <TIMEX3 tid="t845" type="DURATION" value="P1M">a month</TIMEX3> in the Afghan war the GOP abandoned to start their illegitimate Iraqi war and so far we have spent 1 trillion US dollars in Iraq .
So who is really to be blamed here ?
And <TIMEX3 tid="t846" type="DATE" value="2011-06-15">today</TIMEX3> we are still suffering casualties in Afghanistan because George W. Bush , John Boehner and the GOP abandoned and prolonged the Afghan war to wage their senseless and illegitimate Iraqi war .
So far Mladic has been arrested and taken to the ICC in the Hague for war crimes against humanity but <TIMEX3 tid="t847" type="DATE" value="2021">ten years later</TIMEX3> , George W. Bush is showing up at NBA finals and Superbowls , living it up while American sons and daughters are dead as a result of his insidious war atrocities and he is yet to be tried for war crimes .
So why the double standard ?
And is there preferencial treatment when the war criminal in question is white and American ?
At the onset of the Libyan crisis , John McCain , John Boehner and the Republican Party rediculied president Obama and accused him of dragging his feet and not rushing to intervene militarily in Libya because in their words , Libyan civilians were being slaughtered by the Libyan government .
But as soon as president Obama with support of the world community followed through on a UN mandated mission to protect the Libyan people , the GOP decided to flip flopped on the issue , making a 360 and accusing the president of rushing to war .
My message to the GOP is you ' ve got to be kidding right ?

But perhaps the reason why the GOP is upping its stance and criticism on the president for our involvement in Libya is probably because they sense that the Libyan government is about to collapse any day <TIMEX3 tid="t849" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3>
and they just want to score political points by trying to prevent president Obama from getting credit should Moammar Ghadaffi fall .
But what is amasing is that everytime the GOP tries to set up roadblocks for the Obama administration , at the end of the day this administration prevails and so do the American people .
Remember Obama got Osama ?
Yea , and it sure was nice to see Americas celebrate all across the country , waving the American flag once more on that faithful night and remembering what it is like to feel patriotic and be American once again .

And yes , we will wave ole glory once aagain in <TIMEX3 tid="t852" type="DATE" value="2012">2012</TIMEX3> for OBAMA\/BIDEN .

I could n't have said that as well .
Congress has only approved 5 wars in this nations history before the fact , and the last one they approved was WW11 .
GW Bush did not get approval prior to Iraq .
Reagan did not get approval prior to Grenada .
George H W Bush did not get approval prior to Panama ...
where there was no unrest .
What 's so different <TIMEX3 tid="t878" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> compared to Vietnam , Somalia , Grenada , Iraq , and etc . .
Simply the reason is a Republican congress that does n't want to address real issues , they want to drag their feet on jobs , and rather spend their time on this idiocy .
We do n't even have boots on the ground , not one American life has been lost .
This is just their moronic stall tactics ... and they are afraid beside bin Laden , Obama could take credit for helping remove Gaddafi .

If I recall the republicans were complaining because he did n't act fast enough so he is damned by these people no matter what .

Getting rid of Gaddafi in Libya is his way to help the muslim brotherhood to take over and usher in the mahdi .

I believe it is extremely important to look at the facts and argue based on those -- not just feelings or arguments that ` ` hit below the belt '' in order to try to discredit another 's point of view .
It is a good sign that Congress is ensuring President Obama does not abuse his War Powers .
This is a good demonstration of the balance of powers , which makes our country great .
If Congress recognizes -- and they do -- that President Obama has not properly requested authorization to continue U.S. troop involvement in Libya than President Obama should be wise enough to ensure that Congress has sufficient evidence .
Instead by combating the War Powers Resolution he is challenging Congress ' power to ` ` Declare war , raise and support the armies '' of the Constitution - Article I , Section 8 .
I heard an argument here stating that former President W. Bush did not receive congressional authorization to enter Iraq .
<TIMEX3 tid="t1037" type="DATE" value="2002-10-11">October 11 , 2002</TIMEX3> Congress -LRB- both House , 296 to 133 , and the Senate , 77 to 33 -RRB- passed H.J.
Res 114 ` ` Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of <TIMEX3 tid="t1035" type="DATE" value="2002">2002</TIMEX3> .
With congressional authorization , President W. Bush approved an air strike on <TIMEX3 tid="t1043" type="DATE" value="2003-03-19">March 19 , 2003</TIMEX3> , with an invasion on <TIMEX3 tid="t1044" type="DATE" value="2003-03-20">March 20 , 2003</TIMEX3> .
On the same token , President Obama needs to adhere to the Constitution by supporting an action to have Congress vote on allowing the U.S. troops to remain in Libya .
This article is correct -- the War Powers Resolution does allow the President as Commander in Chief -LRB- Constitution , Article II , Sec 2 -RRB- to deploy troops for <TIMEX3 tid="t1048" type="DURATION" value="P60D">60 days</TIMEX3> without approval from Congress , but must receive approval after that time .
This argument may appear to be critical of President Obama , but really it is just a case of looking at the facts .
I believe in the past , the Congress has not utilized the Constitution as they should -- this is a good step in the write direction .

Furthermore , when president obama took office and implemented the Economic Stimulus package , the goal of this was to prevent the American economy from slipping into a catastrophic depression .
But the GOP said , no that is wasteful spending and they urged to let the economy slip into a depression and then the GOP said some <TIMEX3 tid="t1256" type="DURATION" value="P10Y">ten years</TIMEX3> down the road , the American economy will bounce back on its own .
Yet they kept asking where are the jobs ?

And how do you create the basis for American jobs if you do n't first of all , stabilize the broken American economy ?
However , from day one the Federal Reserve which has no party affiliation , said that job growth will be gradual and will fluctuate from time to time because some manufactures would be slow in hiring because of uncertainty over the job market .
When president Obama took office in <TIMEX3 tid="t1257" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> , 23 million Americans had already lost their jobs to the recession caused by the failed and misguided economic policies of the Republican Party .
Let 's face it , in the history of America even during good times , 5 million jobs were never created in <TIMEX3 tid="t1258" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">two years</TIMEX3> , let alone 23 million jobs , especially with the deliberate policy delaying tactics and roadblocks by the GOP .
That brings me to my next point .
When president Obama took office , the GOP said let the BIG THREE , Ford , GM and Chrysler crumble to the ground .
But waht is aamazing about the GOP is how they lack a sense of American history because during World War II , it was the Big Three that was responsible for mobilizing our military and helping America to defeat Fascism in Europe and Imperialism in the Pacific .
And while for <TIMEX3 tid="t1263" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">two years</TIMEX3> the GOP has been sarcastically asking where are the jobs , <TIMEX3 tid="t1260" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">a few months ago</TIMEX3> Florida Republican Governor purposely turned down a multibillion dollar rail project funded by the government , arguing that he was concerned that the project may have exceeded the available funding .
Here 's a governor who declined the opportunity to improve his state 's infastructure and America 's infastructure and the opportunity to create thousands of American jobs .
Then <TIMEX3 tid="t1266" type="DATE" value="2007">a year ago</TIMEX3> , Kentucky senator Jim Bunning blocked a very important highway construction project for the south eastern corridor , arguing that the funding was inflating the national deficit and he and his Republican Party called president Obama fiscally irresponsible .

But when Jim Bunning voted against this bill , his vote alone haulted this project as many workers were told to back their bags and go home .
Wanna know where the jobs are ?
The Party of No . .
They 're JUST a bunch of aholes .

Try doing some actual research and you will find that , while Obama did indeed inherit a falling economy , he and you left - wingnuts have made it much , much worse .
You do n't even have the collective brains amongst your congressman to come up with a budget , an act of stupidity not yet seen in the history of this country !
