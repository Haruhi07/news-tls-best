Testifying before Congress on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2011-04-07">Thursday</TIMEX3> , General Carter Ham , the head of U.S. Africa Command affirmed that the situation in Libya is grinding toward a stalemate .
The Libyan rebels are not an organized fighting force , but Moammar Gadhafi can not mobilize a major offensive against them because of NATO airstrikes and dwindling support within his own army .
So what lies ahead ?
Military analysts and Libya experts articulate three main possibilities : -LRB- 1 -RRB- a prolonged stalemate , -LRB- 2 -RRB- a negotiated settlement , or -LRB- 3 -RRB- total victory for one side .
Prolonged stalemate : The situation could remain much as it is <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> with the opposition controlling Benghazi , Ajdabiya and some of the coastline .
Moammar Gadhafi would control the rest .
Zachary Hosford and Andrew Exum at the Center for a New American Security <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> described what this might look like : A stalemate in Libya would effectively result in a de facto partition of the country with a severely under - governed and disorganized safe haven in eastern Libya for the rebels that could provide refuge for various militant and criminal groups capable of exporting violence and instability to other countries in North Africa and the Middle East .
Max Boot , a national security fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations -LRB- CFR -RRB- , describes the worst case scenario in which this stalemate drags go on for years much as Saddam Hussein clung to power for <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P1DE">a decade</TIMEX3> after the First Gulf War .
Middle East scholar Juan Cole illustrates a more hopeful scenario in which - after weeks , months or perhaps <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> - a negotiated settlement is reached .
He noted that the <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="1995">1995</TIMEX3> Dayton Accords were signed <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P1Y" mod="MORE_THAN">more than a year</TIMEX3> after NATO started bombing in Bosnia .
Negotiated settlement : Many analysts argue that time is not on Gadhafi s side .
NATO strikes wear down his forces while other nations supply the rebels with weapons and training .
The rebels are gaining access to oil money and potentially to Gadhafi s frozen accounts , while sanctions squeeze Gadhafi and his associates .
Unable to pay his mercenaries and losing control , Gadhafi might ultimately feel forced to negotiate , or former loyalists may oust him and negotiate in his stead .
In either event , the outcome of a negotiation is an open question .
They could lead to the establishment of an interim council , paving the way for parliamentary elections , or , if the stalemate lasts for <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DURATION" value="PXY">many years</TIMEX3> , potentially the partition of Libya .
Total victory for one side or the other : Gadhafi s regime could collapse .
This is the scenario many are hoping for .
This could occur if Gadhafi s army breaks in the face of continued NATO bombing or if Gadhafi s deputies defect en masse .
Tripoli would then be open to the rebels .
Having the rebels forcibly overthrow Gadhafi would be much more difficult .
As Libyan journalist Fadel Al - Ameen explains , I don t imagine that the rebels in the East will be capable of driving all the way to Tripoli .
Even if they do , just to invade Tripoli would be a humanitarian catastrophe because Gadhafi and his forces would wreak havoc on the civilian population there .
The opposite possibility is that Gadhafi defeats the rebels and reasserts control over all of Libya .
This is the nightmare scenario , but it is also extremely unlikely .
The world s attention would have to shift away from Libya entirely to allow Gadhafi to amass the requisite force .
Most analysts agree that sooner or later - whether weeks , months or years -- Gadhafi has to go , leaving open the question of what happens next .
As James Lindsay of CFR notes , Part of the problem is we re talking about what happens on day one .
The crucial question is what will be happening in the fall and <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2012">next year</TIMEX3> .
The same is true if the rebels take it all .
That is only the first chapter of the book .
Exum worries because most post - conflict states go through a stage where external aid exceeds the government 's capacity to effectively administer it , creating conditions ripe for corruption .
In Libya 's case , you will have a similar situation with both -LRB- a -RRB- a lot of government oil revenues and -LRB- b -RRB- very little bureaucracy capable of redistributing resources within the society .
But there is also reason for optimism .
As Al - Ameen says , Libya s level of education is high .
We re not looking at a country like Afghanistan , which is a tribal society without leadership or government .
Nor is Libya like Iraq with so many sectarian differences .
Libya also has economic resources that will help it survive and prosper .
The future doesn t look too bad . ''
There 's only one good scenario for the future of Libya and that 's the total victory of the forces loyal to Mohammar Qaddafy .
The fall of Qaddafy would spell the end of Libya 's independence and pave the way for the West to get their grimy hands on Libya 's oil which would be tragic at best .

He did n't do his homework and got caught not knowing who he was ` ` helping '' .
The scary thing is Obama , the Pentagon , CIA and NSA , STILL after weeks of fighting and months of advance warning that something might happen in Libya , STILL have no idea who the rebels are and what they plan on doing if they get Qadaffi out and win .
This is the supposed Commander - In - Chief of the worlds top fighting force .
Obama should be impeached for this attack on Libya .
This is what happens when Sheeple get drawn in by the Orator - In - Chief .
Great talker , no idea what he is doing .
He is just a talking head puppet .

Tea party protested Pres .
Obama for years until they were elected in the congress and turned tame .
Why didn ' t nato intervene ?
Why do n't we shut the H up for once and kill some babies to pay the debt ?
I bet you , Kadafi would n't have hesited to raise taxes on the rich and raise food stamps for the poor in his country .
He does it all the time .
Remember American and Italians used to mine it like they farm cocoa in Ivory coast .
Until Kadhafi came and chased them out .
Kadhafi may have bragged that he supported bombing Panam , but I also convinced that he simply boasted about it , because he did n't like colonial power , and the bombing of an american Panam represented a blow to American pride .

For the <TIMEX3 tid="t81" type="TIME" value="2011-04-06TNI">last night</TIMEX3> analyst on AC360 from John Hopkins to say that we need to show leadership , he is a hypocrite .
When we help they are the same people who burn the american flag , When they need they come running otherwise americans are bad and occupation country .
I would let them burn and then see what happens .
if he really wants to help then he should go and do it .
Nothing is every good enough for Arabs , as we do not do the lying they do on the Quaran .
I would say let it burn and burn and what is left , they can sift and sell oil to build again .

since you all out there know so much about everything and have the only opinions that matter then please , by all meand , stop the freaking complaining and go out there and get involved , or just leave , no one is making you stay in America , if you have so much problems , either help bring positive change or leave , either way , state your opinion respectfully , or shut your mouth .
there is a reason why alot of people are not in charge .
and its because there about as sharp as a lolly pop , so you there fred , of course there is issues with this whoe situation , but if they elected you as any elected senior official , you would probably have a stroke and soil yourself .

what is any country business with that ...
they should send there troops to Sudan and Somalia who have been suffering tribal war for a very long time .
I guess they would n't be there , you American should shut the fuck up and go pay your debt in the world bank .
Am so so surprise that America as the world power were the one owing most in the world bank .
they should concentrate on building there country and paying there debt instead of analyzing other countries conflict .

But we could n't , instead we had to move to a strange new land and assimilate in order to succeed , which is what we did , but sadly , they had to do the same thing back home , Libya , has been a strange land where many people have to do strange things to assimilate with their dictator .
It has been sickened , and the people are SICK AND TIRED of it !
I say go get that poor excuse for a human being and all his thugs and be done with them .
Then my father can return and do right by his home land , my father , not afraid to speak his mind and will never , and has never taken money from Gadhafi to be one of his dirty players .

Yes the worst scenerio is actually the best scenerio .
Libya would be shaken and regime will adapt and tight up the security at the same time .
It will start to look for friends in Arab world , Fundamentalists will be controlled too .
It will focus on more economics , jobs and allow controlled democracy .
It will be similar to what happened in China when they crashed Tianmen square protestors .
It is an unfortunate incident that results both sides to think and <TIMEX3 tid="t149" type="DURATION" value="P30Y">30 years</TIMEX3> of double digits growth .
There will always be dissidents and unhappy people -LRB- as in China -RRB- .
But rather than risk years of turmoil and many losses of life simply because some dissidents are unhappy , it is better to have a stable evolution .
Everyone is adapative and surival instinct is there for everyone .
Noticed Algeria is supposedly a more repressive regime than Egypt and Tunisia .
But they are not doing anything because they learned the hard lessions of revolutions as Chinese did .
At end of the days of a revolution after many deaths and turmoil , the future is too unpredictable and often much worse than before -LRB- French revolution is a case in point -RRB-

Ghaddafi has been helped by the west for a long time .
Even this war he is waging agains his own people is driven by outside foces .
Libyan people could have taken care of Ghaddafi long time ago has not been supported by the filthy greedy western companies .
And let assure you , Ghaddafi is presence is the best fertilizer for extremis -LRB- force breeds counter force

The ring of mountain towns to the south of Tripoli are all in opposition , and are defending themselves .
Towns Gadhafi claims to control are controlled at the point of a gun , not by the peoples support .
Tripoli is under lockdown .
The regime 's ministers and their families have had their passports confiscated , and are under guard in the govt .
compound lest they defect .
Gadhafi 's own govt .
Tripoli is simmering under this oppression .
The most likely and immanent scenario is that Tripoli will explode and liberate themselves .
Gadhafi 's inner circle is getting smaller and smaller .
Not so much because of what the ` ` West '' has done , but becuase of utter disgust of what Gadhafi has done .

After that he became ill and had to ` ` seek treatment '' , in London .
But there remain many dangers , Gadhafi has many friends in Tunisia and they are helping him get supplies into Libya , so while he is down he is truly fighting until the end , , he is a man of his word .

Only his family would be left , and then they would set upon each other .
Saif and Muttassim are already at each others throats .
If Daddy Daffy dies , these brothers will launch a bloody battle between them for power , and East Libya will be in it 's own civil war .

Time IS on their side , no matter how bad Gadhafi makes things in Misrata and elsewhere .
Gadhafi ca n't resupply troops or arms , he 's no longer profiting from all of the oil export , he 'll suffer more defections over time , NATO is breaking the back and will of his army , meanwhile the rebels are getting trained up by the CIA .
In a stalemate , the opposition might have the opportunity to get better organized too .

That being said , I have no idea why the USA is , or is expected to be , the world 's social worker and enforcer .
Yes Ghaddafi is a despot , but he is not the worst .
It was difficult for me to accept , but Libya is more a war for oil , water and M - I complex than any other purpose ; Mostly about the stability of M - I Complex and the instability of Africa .

The water aquifer is not very deep , and may be the best aquifer in the world .
There is a slight chance that he was unifying Africa , and TPTB , were feeling threatened that he might actually pull it off , without having a policy acceptable to EU , much less a succession plan .
USA would have been better off letting EU overthrow Ghaddafi , and saving USA blood and treasure , because it is far more in the interest of Europe to depose Ghaddafi , Particularly Southern Europe 's despots , although it is arguable that even in the short term , peace and prosperity in Africa would be in the best interests of Europa 's peoples .

The United States and Russia got thousands of them each -- enough to devastate the whole planet three times -LRB- each country can do it three times , I repeat -RRB- .
And these are only declared warheads , the number of undeclared ones is said to be triple or fourfold -LRB- again , in each country -RRB- .
The small number and poor technological level of Chinese missiles make American and Russian air defense systems almost impenetrable for them .
But even if we go away from the US and Russia , who 's firepower is obviously superior to the Chinese , we 'll see that , for example , French armed forces can fully handle with China .
France 's got approximately 500 warheads -LRB- and not so poor - leveled missiles as Chinese ones -RRB- .
This is the first point .
However , if China decides to hit France with its missiles , they 'll eminently intercepted by Russian or American air defense systems , because it is impossible to reach France from China without breaking into either Russian or American airspace .
This is the second one .
An the third thing is the fact that French soldiers -LRB- especially the Foreign Legion -RRB- are incomparably better trained than the Chinese .
Of course it is absolutely theoretical scenario , only possible if Sarkozy likes the role of world number one bully so much , that drives totally wild .

Hey Dave , do you really think that if missiles aren ` ` t passing directly above the territory of some country , they are out of its air diffence systems ?
You are inconceivably naive .
Foreign Legion is not an Arabic unit .
It consists of soldiers from the whole world , including America and Russia named above .
And even including soldiers from France 's long - time rival in the past -- the Great Britain .
Believe me , they are the most appreciated force of the unit .

What determine the future in Libya are the free Libyans not the NATO nor Gaddafi and his mercenaries .
When the Libyans revolted peacefully against oppression and injustice they did not consult the NATO or the west about the possibility of succeeding , because they believe in their cause .
Of course , the rhythm of the revolution in terms of the battles on the ground seems slower , but the <TIMEX3 tid="t885" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">coming days</TIMEX3> will bring pleasant surprises to the freedom fighters .
Gaddafi is clinically dead , exactly like Sharon of Israel .
His son is still attempting for less humiliating exit for the family of the dictator .
When the dust of the battle settle down , the Libyans will look back and reward friends and punish those who sided with Gaddafi .

Reply It 's not a matter of imperialism or economic expansionism .
The fact is the rebels are little more than impoverished farmers with a couple guns and technical trucks against a professional army equipped with tanks , artillery and snipers , not to mention training .

After the mullahs are in charge in all of these countries , there is a much greater danger of war with the west .
There will only be bondage .
Where the spirit of the lord is , there is Liberty .
There is only one scenario for Libya and the world at this time : freedom for Libya and the Libyan people ; riddance of Gadaffi .
Those who wo n't accept it will have to accept defeat .

Reply I think First option and first para is most possible because UK and France are involved in this conflict .
Both are master in dividing the nations , creating problem forever , torturing , dividing society and people and making the division and hatred and plundering wealth so much that it is not possible to fill the gap for centuries They could not solve a single problem but created many more .
Look back history and human right in Africa , Asia , Middle East etc during occupation .

It has to be one or the other , if not why waste the international community 's time , effort & money ?
The international community supports the rebels not for oil purposes but for humanity .
People should have the right to express themselves freely and not be punished for it but middle eastern countries do not like criticism nor handle it in a humane way .
We -LRB- the international community -RRB- should put all lies aside given to us by Qaddafi 's regime and entirely back the rebels and let them decide their future or step out completely and let Qaddafi continue killing his own people without any interference .

If this was not the most immoral sign of self preservation to avoid reprisals against them then I do not know what it was .
So , did they all of a sudden grow brains and realized they were backing a wrong man ?
They were appalled by the crack down on protesters so they said .
Oooh , please move over !
These people who took to the streets of Libya should be called what they really are , anarchists , pure and simple .
They were not peacefully calling on the government to discuss changes they wanted made as a matter of urgency .
What they wanted was a sudden and disorderly removal of a regime by any means necessary .
This is what I find rather disturbing and the West and everyone is unanimously in support of such actions .
Is this the culture we are truly advocating all disgruntled nationals to employ whenever they are unhappy with their leaders ?
It is clearly undeniable that the western powers are not entirely being driven by their morality in dealing with what is happening in the Arab world particularly in Libya .
What they failed to achieve through the <TIMEX3 tid="t1030" type="DURATION" value="PXY">many years</TIMEX3> of isolating Libya , they have most definitely found a necessary primer to try again in the <TIMEX3 tid="t1029" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> crisis to push this agenda .

Reply The only scary thing about these revolutions is the possibility of something worse -- something more extremist -- gaining a foothold .

The only difference is that comparing the Muslim Brotherhood with the Tea Party , the latter appears a genuine example of liberalism .

No , the only reason is that if people want freedom , they have to fight for it -LRB- not necessarily with weapons

-RRB- was that a Libya with Gaddafi still in power would not fly and to prove to other leaders that Gaddafi 's model of response would not work .
If there is a negotiated settlement , will Gaddafi in the future build up his arms and try to attack again ?

And if he does will the international community respond in a similar way ?
There should be no surprise that the opposition forces will not agree to anything that includes a Gaddafi in power .
As Fareed pointed out earlier , if anything is going to break Gaddafi , it is going to be economic pressure and defections of his inner circle .
In this sense , the best outcome is somewhere between 2 and 3 .
To accomplish this , NATO should continue with its operations , continue to train\/arm the rebels , and also provide them with humanitarian aid if needed .
Meanwhile , the African Union should work to convince Gaddafi to gracefully step down from power so as not to anger the supporters in Tripoli .
This brings up another important question : how will Gaddafi s most ardent supporters in Tripoli view the rebels if\/when they try to form a new government in the name of Libya ?
There is nothing wrong with arguing , protesting , or yelling at each other to achieve political power and compromise , but I do not know how attached to Gaddafi Libyans in Tripoli are .
If they decide to reject the rebels interim government and the contention devolves into another civil conflict then the coalition will have no choice but to pull out .

it worked for that time & he controlled his regime successfully with the tool of spreading fear unjustified brutality on his nation an easy way out to rule which was his worst cruelity & backbone for stablizing his regime ...

revolution in Libya is justified but only in the sense when it was planned to win or to die . .
not just by hang the country & start crying like a baby for help ... opposition might have brought a great start of revolution but they do nt have further plan which is highly required to run the country ...
they are just selling their country on any cost for throwing Kadafi out ... & Kadafi is dictotor who ruled for <TIMEX3 tid="t1102" type="DURATION" value="P42Y">42 years</TIMEX3> even after extremly opposed by West . .
how can he accept his incomplete defiet ...
