They slow the advance of rebel fighters In Tiji , civilians used as shields are keeping rebels from attacking , they say In Zlitan , reporters are taken to a funeral after a NATO strike Qawalish , Libya -LRB- CNN
-RRB- --
The front lines of Libya 's grinding war weave through the western mountains and around Zlitan , the last city east of Tripoli still under the grip of strongman Moammar Gadhafi .
In many places that Gadhafi 's forces have fled , they ' ve left behind deadly fields of mines -- tens , perhaps hundreds of thousands of them , say the rebels .
Not only do they pose a danger for civilians but they also have slowed the advance of the rebels in their march toward Tripoli .
Here in Qawalish , a town 60 miles southwest of Tripoli where fierce fighting has taken place in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent weeks</TIMEX3> , the war looks like this : Men in no protective gear sift through a public park to fight an enemy that can kill instantly and indiscriminately .
Here , the enemy is Gadhafi 's landmines .
Milad al Saidy and his fellow ` ` sappers , '' as those who work with mines are known , are armed only with simple metal probes and a couple of metal detectors .
A burned - out shell of a car sits as evidence of what the mines can do .
Libya 's frontline on an ancient fort Ramadan does n't slow civil war in Libya Reporter 's journey into Western Libya So far , they say , about 2,500 mines have been discovered , all left by fleeing pro - Gadhafi forces .
Al Saidy has been doing this work for <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P16Y">16 years</TIMEX3> but many others are green -- fresh recruits who volunteered for a potentially deadly job .
Some learn on the job .
Amazingly , al Saidy said , no one has been killed or hurt .
` ` It 's very , very dangerous but people are insisting they want to work with us to secure the lives of the innocent , the children , so families can come without the fear of landmines , '' he said .
The sapper teams find a Chinese - made anti - tank mine , designed to blow up armored vehicles .
The rebels explain that the anti - tank mines require a lot of pressure to detonate .
So , Gadhafi 's men place Brazilian - made anti - personnel mines , which blow when a person steps on them , atop the bigger mines .
The result is an easier but potentially far more deadly blast .
The work , al Saidy said , is crucial .
He and his men toil under the sun , even though it is Ramadan .
They observe the rules of the holy month , neither eating nor drinking and pausing only to pray .
` ` The circumstances command us to work , '' he said .
Farther west , rebel fighters loom over the town of Tiji from an observation post .
This place , the locals say , was used by the Berbers 2,000 years ago to look out for invading Roman armies .
<TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> it 's a lookout for a whole new war .
The rebels call Tiji a gateway city .
If they are able to wrest control from Gadhafi 's men , there would be little between them and Tripoli .
But talk of victory and actually achieving it are two different things .
The rebels said they engaged Gadhafi 's troops <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2011-W31">this week</TIMEX3> but then saw women and children running into houses .
` ` In this situation we 're facing a big problem because Gadhafi is using people as a human shield , '' said Tarek Zambou , head of the local military council .
CNN could not independently verify that claim , but it 's clear that after making significant gains <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2011-W30">last week</TIMEX3> in half a dozen towns beneath the Nafusa Mountains , rebel advances have stalled in this key town .
The rebels said they have sent word to residents : Leave <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> .
It wo n't be long before they are firing again .
<TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P5M">Five months</TIMEX3> into the Libyan war , the rebels have won international support and NATO jets have continuously bombed Gadhafi 's forces .
But so far , they have not been able to break the dictator 's hold .
On the eastern front , they have been pushing in Zlitan .
<TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2011-08-04">Thursday</TIMEX3> , however , it appeared that Gadhafi 's forces were still in control of the central city .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent weeks</TIMEX3> , NATO has intensified its bombing of Zlitan , which is less than 50 miles west of rebel - held Misrata .
<TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2011-08-02">Tuesday</TIMEX3> , jets struck two buildings in Zlitan , the alliance said .
One of Gadhafi 's main battle tanks was destroyed in that attack .

A follow - up run <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="TIME" value="2011-08-04TMO">Thursday morning</TIMEX3> attacked another command - and - control center , used to support multiple rocket launchers , NATO said .
A mother and her two boys were buried <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2011-08-04">Thursday</TIMEX3> .
The Libyan government , which took reporters on a tour of the city , said they were killed in the airstrikes that hit a two - story villa in a residential neighborhood .
A NATO spokesman acknowledged the airstrike but said : ` ` We do not know of any casualties , we have only heard the government allegations of casualties visa the media . ''
Abu Bakr , the brother of the slain woman , wept through the funeral .
He pulled back the blankets covering the two small coffins bearing the bloody bodies of his nephews , Mohamed , 5 , and Motez , 3 .
` ` Whether you like it or not , we 're staying here , '' he yelled .
` ` This is our country . ''
He damned NATO and ` ` the rats , '' the Libyan regime 's word for the rebels .
Back in Qawalish , al Saidy , the sapper , leaves the minefields to return to his vehicle .
He knows there is no end date yet for his risky work .
` ` The more we advance , the more landmines we are facing , '' he said .
But at least on <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2011-08-04">this day</TIMEX3> , there 's good news .
CNN 's Michael Holmes reported from Qawalish and Tiji and Ivan Watson reported from Zlitan .
