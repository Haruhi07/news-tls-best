I just wrote a piece for Time Magazine on Obama 's strategy problem in Libya .
Here 's an excerpt : Call it the Goldilocks military plan : Not too much , not too little , not too unilateral , not too American .
The operation against Muammar Gaddafi 's regime in Libya mirrors the moderate temperament of its architect , Barack Obama .
But will it work in the rough realities of international politics ?
That 's the question that will be tested in the weeks ahead as high - tech images of cruise missiles hitting their targets give way to a mess on the ground in Libya .
President Obama has launched an operation that has two distinct qualities , one highly unusual and the other familiar .
At its broadest , Obama 's diplomacy has tried to redefine the exercise of American power .
It is an effort at a distinctive form of multilateralism , deeper than anything any President has tried before .
At the same time , Obama is proposing a limited military intervention for a problem in which U.S. interests are limited .
That 's something Presidents in the past have promised but mostly been unable to deliver as events on the ground forced them to escalate for fear of being humiliated .
However wise his multilateral instincts , it is how Obama handles this latter problem that will determine the mission 's success and duration .
Check out the full article over at Time and let me know what you think .
So far both conflicting parties in Libya refuse to cede .
Gaddafis regime wants to recapture the east of the country and the rebels want to seize Tripoli and make it the capital of their new nation .
What happens in Libya is deja vu .
In history we see quite a number of similar cases .
Ho Chi Minh and Mao Tse Tung had to fight hard to achieve their goals and they are the revered founders of their countries .
Let the rebels fight the regime and as time goes by we know them better .
If they prevail , they win the legitimacy to build a new Libyan nation .
Another alternative would be a time - consuming negociation with the two parties .

I do think the media should raise the following questions to Muslim Leaders , regarding what is happening in Libya : 1 - Where is Muslim Justice ?
Is Gadafi & his thugs carrying out Sharia Law ? ?
Is killing Muslims & destroying Mosques the example of Muslim leadership to set in the world .
Is this the Nation of Islam , that we should look up to ? ? ?
2 - Where is Muslim Brotherhood ?
Is it just a label of a group of fanatics used to extort or blackmail the West ? ? ?
3 - How come the West have moved to protect defensless muslims in Libya , Egypt , Tunisia etc . , and Muslims Leaders together with their so called Arab league has not moved a finger to help suffering Muslims ?
4 - Is n't it time , for these Muslim leaders , to grow up , take responsibility , clean up their dirty wash , and stop crying to the West for aid & dole outs ? ?
5 - Why has the Azhar and other supposedly scholarly institutions , not decree a ` Fatwa ' condemning Gadafi & his like to be infidels , that all Muslims should prosecute , and carry out a ` Gihad ' against him until he is brought to justice ...
This is not a load the US or West should take .
This is a load Muslim Leaders should take ...
Thanks for reading .
First off , my demographic .
I ' m a WASP , <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P56Y">56 years</TIMEX3> of age , living in the US , who has been a news and political junkie since Johnson had to take the Oath of Office when Kennedy was assassinated .
I ' m also a stringer reporter , albeit new to the business .
<TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> , here is my beef .
These are mighty trying times , both at home and abroad .
We are being insanely co - opted into realms that we can not possible handle , nor explain , nor resolve .
As an old guy , here are the things that I do not understand .
Perhaps you can help me with this .
We intervened in Bosnia , because the atrocities were so acute .
However , we stayed away from Rwanda .
We went , guns a blazing to Grenada , yet we were content to allow all the despots in Africa have full rein to slaughter as many as they liked .
North Koreans have been starving to death for decades , but somehow that 's okay .
I guess because they supposedly have a bomb that works .
Myanmar has been hideous for a long time , but I guess that 's okay too , because they are Indonesian , and we do n't want that again .
It 's okay that Mubarak can go .
We never really liked him anyway , no matter how many dollars we pumped into his military .
But , we ca n't mess with Bahrain , or the Saudi 's , nor half a dozen other places there , because it would not be in our best interests .
We can beat our chest at Iran , but forgo any action towards Syria .
We leave Lebanon hanging out to dry , because , well , I ' m not even certain anymore .
But , it 's okay to spend millions of dollars spanking Libya , and to what end ?
We do not have enough fingers to plug up the holes of so many dikes !
This whole thing is really getting insane .
The other night , I watched as we shot over $ 136 million dollars worth of Tomahawk Missiles into Libya .
I thought , Jeez , that money could have really come in handy to those of us here at home who are suffering , and looking for a place to sleep , and a warm meal , and perhaps retraining for a job which they can sustain their families with .
I will share an acronym with you , Fareed .
It 's called POTS , which stands for Pandemic of Terminal Stupidity .
Feel free to use it .

Albeit Clintons great regret was doing nothing in Rowanda , Bush took us on an adventure in Iraq and Afghanistan , the crimes of the Ivory Coast are off the chart .
We ca n't fight them all and more than likely we will have little say about the futures of Bush 's wars .
<TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Right now</TIMEX3> there are two big issues on the table .
In North Africa there are three nations facing the possible light of democracy .
Tunesia , Egypt , and Lybia each have there own issues to find the path to democracy .
If one falls off the path it can take down the other two .
15 % of the population of Lybia is Egypsian workers for example .
If we ` can invest a smal air war to support freedom in that 3 nation stretch its a triple homerun .
Imagine an out of the park victory for the moderates of the world .
That could bring true peace to the west of Isreal that is really lasting .
The other problem is the middle east proper .
King Abdoulla of Saudi Arabia vrs the Iatolla 's in Iran .
Bahrain is ruled by Suni , like King Abdoulla of Saudi Arabia .
Yemen is also ruled by Suni , but Syria is friendly to the Shiites that are friendly with Iran , supply hezbolla with weapons and so forth .
My money is on King Abdoulla and his 500,000 man USA trained military .
Why does this all matter to you ?
Well in Europe they pay $ 7 to $ 8 usd pergallon for gasoline .
We spend enmass on the 5th and 6th fleets to keep trade routes and our business partners safe in the middle East .
If we stop supporting the King , get your wallet out and we will pay like the rest of the world for gas .
In fact with the <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> speculation we will face an estimated $ 9.50 oper gallon in the USA .

Why do nt we ` ` Drill Baby Drill '' ?
Ron Reagan was a really smart guy .
His Idea was we use everyone elses oil first before we touch the massive oil reserves in the USA and the Artic .
We can argue , fiddle , fight , and all sorts of things until the world is dry of oil before we even think to begin to drill what we can .
He implied in policy that there will be <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> , when nations fight for food , water , and of course oil .
The nation that runs out of oil reserves will lose that war .
While we were plaing in Iraq and Afghanistan , China made massive investments in Africa .
Lybia sells the lions share of their light crude to China , thus the 30,000 Chinese workers in Lybia .
Sub Saharan African is all locked up on oil by China .
Meanwhile Saudi Arabia is starting to run out as is Mexico and a few other places we get oil .
Estimates on those feilds are falling dramatically and the Saudi 's have failed to miss estimates for <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DURATION" value="P5Q">5 quarters</TIMEX3> .
Mexico like Venezuala nationalized the oil industry and stuck it to every oil company that did the exploration like Texico in the day and <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> no one trusts them to do business .
So <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> it really boils down to that nut job in Iran vrs King Abdoulla .
Remember the Saudi protesters are the Shiite group that 12 of the 199\/11 hijackers came from .
So we are betting on this Arab Sping to grow into Iran and Syria at the same time that we want Jordan , Baharain , and I raq to hang with King Abdulla .
Yemen will likely end up in total chaos , and get its tail kicked by either King Abdulla or the USA .
The uprising in Yemen is Al Quieda in the Arab Pennesula demanding their own country .
The USA <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> spends 150 million <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> with the ` ` president of Yemen '' to fight AQAP .
They control more than half the country and bombed the USS Cole .
I hope this explains the whole picture to you .

Al Qaeda is fundamentally sunny organization , I believe , furthermore it is on the extreme end of this shia to sunny spectrum , and bin Laden has ideological differences with both Iran and Qaddafi .

I make a living on understanding the worlds economic issues .
As a former Kansan and US soldier with a degree in economics I feel sad about the USA .
We can solve this countries problems with common sense
but we refuse to do so .
We spend 300 billion dollars <TIMEX3 tid="t39" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> and 500,000 Americans are killed by smoking every single year , why is that not outlawed ?
If you want to smoke sign a waiver that we need not spend $ 250,000 usd trying to apply palative care when you get stage IV non small cell lung cancer .
Other wise if a cop see 's you smoking you go to jail and get fined $ 20,000 usd .
We spend 1 trillion dollars <TIMEX3 tid="t41" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> on 4 single issues like that which would balance the budget as fast as the congress can write the bills .
Secondly we need four investments in the USA and a new 18 % flat tax .
# 1 Invade Mexico
and
end the drug war combined with a real fence like Isreal has and seems to be impossible to pass .
Give Amnesty to those in country along with a $ 50,000 usd price tag per man or woman .
They can pay $ 100 <TIMEX3 tid="t44" type="DURATION" value="P1W">a week</TIMEX3> payments until they earn their citizenship , and pay their back taxes or get out and do nt come back .
<TIMEX3 tid="t46" type="DURATION" value="P10Y">10 years</TIMEX3> hard labor if they try to sneak back in the USA .
Mexico is our largest customer and business is bad because of the drug wars .
More people die <TIMEX3 tid="t47" type="SET" value="P1Y" quant="EACH">each year</TIMEX3> in Mexico than get killed in Iraq or Afghanistan .
# 2 Lead the world in High Speed Rail so a worker in Indiana can get a job in Detroit 300 miles away and get to work in <TIMEX3 tid="t51" type="DURATION" value="PT45M">45 minutes</TIMEX3> .
In China that high speed national rail system drpped unemployement by 4 % .
In South Korea it dropped unemployent by 6 % .
In South Korea I visit a factory built at a manufacturing hub 190 km south of Seoul <TIMEX3 tid="t52" type="SET" value="P1Y" quant="EVERY">every year</TIMEX3> .
It takes me 30 min to get to that manufacturing area where 95,000 people work in 300 factories .
Shuttle buses take people from the rail to factories like clock work .
Much the same in China quarter million jobs after <TIMEX3 tid="t56" type="DURATION" value="P9M" mod="APPROX">about 9 months</TIMEX3> training .
Like IKES Interstate highway system that took <TIMEX3 tid="t59" type="DURATION" value="P6M">6 months</TIMEX3> to set up and <TIMEX3 tid="t60" type="DURATION" value="P12Y">12 years</TIMEX3> to build .
# 3 Complete President Obama ; s -LRB- actually the brain trust at MIT designed the new electrical grid system called ` ` Smart ''
It starts with the meter on your house , new wiring all through , new smart transformers , and Nano Technology integrated into the new power grid .
<TIMEX3 tid="t62" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Currently</TIMEX3> it will be done in <TIMEX3 tid="t61" type="DATE" value="2025">2025</TIMEX3> when its <TIMEX3 tid="t64" type="DURATION" value="P10Y">10 years</TIMEX3> out of date .
If we hire and train 250,000 men <TIMEX3 tid="t67" type="DATE" value="2011-03-24">today</TIMEX3> it would be done in <TIMEX3 tid="t69" type="DURATION" value="P3Y">36 months</TIMEX3> .
Thousands of factories ca n't come to the USA cause our utilities are out dated and every new factory requires a multi million dollar invesrtment in direct power lines to the factory from the source .
We rank 61rst of 168 countreis in our Utility techniology in use .
The new power grid will cut lost energey amounting to 35 % of what we use in the USA more than enough to cover the oil we buy from outside the USA .
It will cut everyones electric bill by 26 % .
# 4 High Speed Boadband the new advanced model that is only available in 3 US cities like Chatanooga .
A Dr can email a massive file like a ct scan over this in real time .
That speed is available in all of Europe .
Also let me point out when I ' m in Europe my cell phone works in Spain or Sweden and there are no zones or coverage areas .
Were a really 8th rate gaggle in our wireless networks and half assed cell towers .
# 5 Get rid of the IRS and its half million workers .
Flat tax the country at 18 % for every corporation , partnership , or individual in the USA .
We will save 490 billion <TIMEX3 tid="t71" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> in cost .
-LRB- Not counting what we pay to get our taxes done -RRB-
Corporations like Exxon wo nt be tax free and earn 10 billion net <TIMEX3 tid="t73" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> , or GE 5.1 billion and also pay nothing on a 24,000 page tax return thar will never be seriously looked at cause the IRS has no time .

I have a question however , and maybe you can answere it .
Why does CNN and many of their commentary guests relative to Libya , refere to gadaffi as ` ` Colonel Gadaffi '' ?
Is this individual actually a commisioned military colonel , or is that just an aquired ` ` nick name '' .
To me , he absolutely does not deserve the true commission title of ` ` Colonel '' .
Refering to and addressing this terrorist and yet to be determined ` ` war ciminal '' as ` ` Colonel '' , is to me , to very offensive .
Unless he has a genuine claim to the commision of Colonel , I would suggest that CNN and all other media , STOP USING THE TERM ` ` COLONEL '' in the context of this gadaffi buffoon !

Because of his modesty for which he is well known , he did not promote himself to general , generalissimus , or whatever other title dictators usually invent for themselves , and stayed in colonel rank throughout his entire 42 - year tenure .
So there is nothing wrong with CNN calling him ` ` Colonel Qaddafi '' , or simply ` ` Colonel '' .

<TIMEX3 tid="t102" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> let 's sort out the use of term ` ` war criminal '' and the implied ` ` use of air strikes against populated areas '' by Qaddafi and ` ` slaughter of innocent civilians '' , ` ` atrocities '' , etc : It is actually NOT PROVEN at this point .
Not by Al Jazira .
Not found on Youtube .
Surely , Qaddafi had used tanks and multiple rocket launchers : we saw them very clearly in reports by CNN correspondent Nick Robertson .
And , presumably , these tanks fired their guns sometimes .
And presumably some bombs were dropped by Qaddafi airplanes .

And presumably all these tanks were used to intimidate civilians when they entered into a city or town .
But what about showing destruction of civilian homes We clearly so Qaddafi residence destroyed by NATO cruise missiles , and crater left in some port , but what about showing destroyed civilian homes in Benghazi or elsewhere in rebel - controlled territory .
Can anyone on this board ... After all , tanks a routinely used to intimidate peaceful demonstrators throughout the world .

Reply It 's almost comical the way western leaders play to the gallery and invest huge sums in military theatrics that achieve little .
It seems evident that it 's economic interest more that anything else that influences the west especially America .
So Gbagbo can choose to ignore the peoples vote and continue his illegitimate rule without as much as a look in from America .
Once oil interests show up , America 's moralistic gibberish spews forth .
It 's not about care for the Libyans , Egyptians or Saudis , it 's the oil ` ` stupid '' !

They want the Libyan people to solve their problem .
That is they are not standing for democracy and freedom .
How much angry carry on the rebels when they take over Gadhafi regime ?
How many people are going die before and after dictator Gadhafi is over ?
When Libyan people ask the world for help , they need to do fair and equal to every people in Libya .
They must build up a new government that stands for democracy and freedom and watch them careful until a new life comes back to normal .
