For days , the wounded just kept coming to the 60 - bed central hospital in Misrata , a city under siege from forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi .
But there were no empty beds , no electricity -- only generator power .
No anesthesia or painkillers .
A doctor said 109 people have died in Misrata over <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-W11">the past week</TIMEX3> .
Six were killed <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2011-03-24">Thursday</TIMEX3> by Gadhafi 's rooftop snipers -- unseen but too often precise .
More than 1,300 others have been wounded since the protests erupted in the western city <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011-02">last month</TIMEX3> .
People flooded the hospital , wounded in war that has raged between the opposition and Gadhafi 's forces .
The strongman 's tanks have been pounding the city and bombs fell <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2011-03-24">Thursday</TIMEX3> near the hospital , the doctor said .
Residents reported a reprieve after coalition airstrikes targeted the Libyan military .
But rooftop snipers kept taking aim .
And the doctors kept doing their work .
Snipers surround hospital in Misrata Libyan govt .
media trip goes wrong Gadhafi tanks turned into wreckage They treated patients in corridors , and operated on them even without anesthesia .
They sent people with what the doctor called lesser injuries home to recuperate -- including people whose legs and arms were amputated .
` ` We do n't have the space , '' he said , the weariness in his voice apparent even on a poor phone connection from Libya .
Snipers surrounded the hospital , he said .
<TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2011-03-24">Thursday</TIMEX3> , patients were to a clinic .

But the injured in the city could no longer seek help at the hospital .
The snipers were shooting at the ambulances .
The coalition began airstrikes <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2011-03-19">last Saturday</TIMEX3> and has been able to establish a no - fly zone that spans from east to west along Libya 's coastline .

But Gadhafi 's forces are far from defeated .
They camped on the periphery of Misrata , trying to wrest it from opposition control , and leaving its people , including those at the central hospital , in a dire situation .
