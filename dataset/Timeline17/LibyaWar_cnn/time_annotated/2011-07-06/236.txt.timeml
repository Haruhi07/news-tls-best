Clinton : Gadhafi should step down Daughter : Gadhafi is ` symbol , guide ' Donilon : No decision on arming Libya The rebels ran over Al - Qawalish , a town of about 4,000 residents 50 kilometers -LRB- 31 miles -RRB- southwest of Tripoli , a stronghold for Gadhafi since the start of the uprising in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2011-02">February</TIMEX3> .
Their attacks got under way <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="TIME" value="2011-07-06T07:00" mod="APPROX">around 7 a.m.</TIMEX3> from the north , the west and the south .
On the western front , journalist David Adams said rebels were using Grad launchers , two Russian tanks and a number of other vehicles , rockets and guns .
The rebels captured the town <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="TIME" value="2011-07-06T14:30" mod="APPROX">around 2:30 p.m.</TIMEX3> , entering from all three fronts , some having captured vehicles belonging to Gadhafi forces .
Some rebel fighters could be seen breaking windows , shooting doors of houses and rummaging through families ' belongings .
Some said they were looking for weapons , but they appeared to be looting .
After they had lost control of the town , Gadhafi forces began shelling its periphery with Grad rockets .
At least 12 government soldiers died , six were wounded and seven were captured , said Adams .
Rebels , whose casualties included at least seven dead and 15 wounded , said their next target would be Al Assabiah , said Adams .
Hassan Al - Jiwali , a rebel fighter from the Nafusa Mountains , said 50 of Gadhafi 's men were killed and 15 were captured in the offensive .
Fighting has erupted in the western mountains in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent weeks</TIMEX3> as <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P4M" mod="MORE_THAN">more than four months</TIMEX3> of battles have failed to yield a decisive victory for either side .
The first United Nations joint mission to reach the devastated mountain region found many people in dire need of food .
A World Food Programme statement said markets were not functioning due to limited fuel and cash , and basic services such as electricity and water were lacking in some areas .
The rebels said they were moving northward , closer to the capital on the Mediterranean Sea .
They intended to march to the city of Garyan , which sits on the main highway to Tripoli .
Also <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2011-07-06">Wednesday</TIMEX3> , NATO said its air forces targeted military re - fueling equipment in the Brega area southwest of the rebel stronghold of Benghazi .
` ` These precision strikes will limit the ability of pro - Gadhafi forces to threaten Libyan civilians and significantly degrade logistical support for Gadhafi 's campaign in eastern Libya , '' said Lt . Gen. Charles Bouchard , commander of Operation Unified Protector , in a news release .
France has acknowledged arming the rebels , saying the weapons were for self - defense .
However , French Defense Minister Gerard Longuet said <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2011-07-05">Tuesday</TIMEX3> the weapons were no longer necessary because the rebels were becoming ` ` more autonomous . ''
But debate continued over France 's decisions .
In a contentious closed - door U.N. Security Council meeting <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2011-07-05">Tuesday</TIMEX3> , Russia argued that , by sending weapons , France had violated the council 's resolution that authorized the use of NATO force in Libya .
