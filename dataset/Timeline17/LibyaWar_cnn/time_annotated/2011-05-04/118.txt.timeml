By the CNN Wire Staff War crimes threat against Gadhafi ?
NEW : The U.S. is making available an additional $ 6.5 million for emergency assistance An International Criminal Court report cites ` ` reasonable grounds '' Arrests ` ` will contribute to the protection of civilians in Libya , '' it says The U.S. ambassador to the U.N. warns those around Gadhafi of tying their fate to his -LRB- CNN
-RRB- --
The chief prosecutor for the International Criminal Court said in a report <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2011-05-04">Wednesday</TIMEX3> there are ` ` reasonable grounds to believe that crimes against humanity have been committed and continue being committed in Libya . ''
The report highlighted the alleged commission of rape by Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi 's government , as well as the deportation or forcible transfer of citizens during the civil war that continues to rage in that country .
It also noted war crimes , including intentionally directing attacks against civilians not participating in the fighting .
ICC Prosecutor Luis Moreno - Ocampo issued a statement saying he will soon request arrest warrants against three individuals who are ` ` most responsible for the crimes committed . ''
The individuals were not named .
` ` It is indeed a characteristic of the situation in Libya that massive crimes are reportedly committed upon instruction of a few persons who control the organizations that execute the orders , '' the report said .
` ` Arresting those who ordered the commission of crimes , should the judges decide to issue warrants , will contribute to the protection of civilians in Libya . ''
In <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-03">March</TIMEX3> , shortly after the International Criminal Court was asked to investigate the issue , a court spokeswoman said Gadhafi would probably face serious charges .
But the prosecutor did not name the people against whom he had evidence .
` ` Even <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2011-05-04">today</TIMEX3> , people in Tripoli are arrested illegally , tortured and they disappear , '' Moreno - Ocampo told CNN .
` ` We have evidence of that and we will show it to the judges . ''
It is not clear if he plans to file charges against anyone on the rebel side , though the report mentioned ` ` alleged war crimes as well as other crimes against humanity '' appear to have been committed by ` ` different parties . ''
He warned when he opened the probe <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-03">two months ago</TIMEX3> that the rebels are subject to international law just as Gadhafi 's forces are .
` ` <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> , there are people opposing Gadhafi with weapons .
And also we would like to warn them , you can not commit crimes .
Our business in Libya is -LRB- to -RRB- stop the crimes , '' he told CNN in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2011-03">March</TIMEX3> .
Susan Rice , the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , said the specter of ICC prosecution ` ` should warn those around Gadhafi about the perils of continuing to tie their fate to his . ''
` ` Gadhafi has lost any and all legitimacy to lead Libya , '' she said , remarking on ` ` widespread and systematic attacks '' against civilians by government forces .
Her comments were later echoed by the acting deputy spokesman for the U.S. State Department , Mark Toner , who called on Gadhafi to cease hostilities and to ` ` allow the International Organization for Migration and other organizations to provide much needed relief and evacuation services to civilians caught up in the Libyan conflict . ''
He said the United States is making available an additional $ 6.5 million for the migration organization 's operations in Libya .
That means the United States <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> is shelling out a total of $ 53.5 million in emergency assistance ` ` to meet the humanitarian needs of conflict victims , vulnerable migrants , and others displaced by the civil unrest in Libya , '' he said .
But the Russian ambassador to the United Nations said Russia is ` ` deeply alarmed by the growing number of civilian causalities and the destruction of civilian facilities as a result of the actions by opposing Libyan parties . ''
` ` Unfortunately it must be noted that actions by NATO - led coalition forces also lead to civilian causalities , '' said Ambassador Vitaly Churkin .
` ` This took place in particular during <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> bombings in Tripoli . ''
He warned against exceeding the mandate established by U.N. Security Council resolution 1973 , which allows military action in Libya to protect civilians .
` ` Any disproportionate use of force is unacceptable , '' he said .
This is the first time the International Criminal Court has begun investigating possible crimes against humanity as they were occurring in wartime , Moreno - Ocampo said .
Social networking websites such as Facebook were part of the reason that was possible , he said .
` ` This triggered a very quick reaction .

The -LRB- United Nations -RRB- Security Council reacted in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="PXD">a few days</TIMEX3> , the U.N. General Assembly reacted in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="PXD">a few days</TIMEX3> .
So , <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> because the Court is up and running we can do this immediately , '' he said .
` ` I think Libya is a new world , '' he added .
` ` How we manage the new challenge , that 's what we will see <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> . ''
The United Kingdom used <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2011-05-04">Wednesday</TIMEX3> 's meeting to support investigations in Libya , while also using the forum to urge Syria not to attack protesting civilians .
` ` The deteriorating situation in Syria is of increasing concern in this regard , '' said Ambassador Mark Lyall Grant .
` ` The violent repression there must stop immediately . ''
Meanwhile , Gadhafi 's forces once again shelled Misrata 's port on <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2011-05-04">Wednesday</TIMEX3> , leaving five people dead and dozens injured , a rebel spokesman told CNN .
The shelling started <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="TIME" value="2011-05-04T13:00" mod="APPROX">around 1 p.m.</TIMEX3> ` ` This is the only terminal we have for the city and for humanitarian vessels to come in and take foreigners out , '' rebel spokesman Ahmed Hassan said .
A few ambulances and private cars arrived on the scene to take the casualties away after the shelling stopped .
The International Organization for Migration told CNN that it had one chartered vessel that entered Misrata 's port <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="TIME" value="2011-05-04TMO" mod="START">early Wednesday morning</TIMEX3> .
Contact was made with the ship 's captain , and no one was injured on the boat .
Some 840 migrants have boarded the boat , and more were being placed on board , the IOM said .
The vessel , which had brought 180 tons of humanitarian aid to Misrata , was expected to depart in the afternoon .
As the bloody battles in the North African country dragged into their fourth month , a U.N. official said the Libyan government and opposition members were trying to find a way for a cease - fire .
Abdul Ilah al - Khatib , the U.N. 's special envoy to Libya , said both sides had told him that they were ready for a cease - fire .
The only problem was that they disagreed on what conditions would be needed to lay down arms , the envoy said .
The Libyan government wants an end to NATO aerial attacks ; the opposition wants Gadhafi to step down and will not negotiate with him or any of his family members , al - Khatib said .
` ` A real and credible cease - fire must be agreed upon to suspend aggressive actions and killing of innocent civilians , including women and children , '' al - Khatib told the U.N. Security Council on <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2011-05-03">Tuesday</TIMEX3> .
` ` A cease - fire must be declared either formally , or -- in a first step -- as part of an informal understanding between the opposing forces in Libya . ''
NATO began bombing Libya on <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2011-03-19">March 19</TIMEX3> , after the U.N. Security Council approved a resolution authorizing any means necessary , short of invasion , to protect civilians demanding the end of Gadhafi 's nearly 42 - year rule .
<TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2011-W18-WE">This weekend</TIMEX3> , Libyan authorities said one of Gadhafi 's sons and three of his grandchildren were killed by a NATO airstrike .
This prompted an increase in pro - Gadhafi forces ' attacks in rebel - held cities and also in the beleaguered western port city of Misrata , witnesses said .
An explosion rocked Benghazi <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2011-05-03">Tuesday</TIMEX3> , the eastern city that is controlled by rebel fighters .
The blast damaged several cars in Benghazi 's main square and a rebel spokesman blamed it on Gadhafi supporters who were somehow able to infiltrate the rebel - held city .
CNN could not independently confirm that report .
The continued fighting has sent people fleeing .
More than 8,000 people -- most of them women and children -- fled into Tunisia over <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="2011-W17-WE">the weekend</TIMEX3> to escape the fighting between Libyan government troops and opposition forces , the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2011-05-03">Tuesday</TIMEX3> Nearly 40,000 Libyans have fled the country 's western mountainous region in <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2011-04">the past month</TIMEX3> as pro - Gadhafi and opposition forces have fought for control of the border crossing point , according to the U.N. CNN 's Mitra Mobasherat and Atika Shubert contributed to this report .
