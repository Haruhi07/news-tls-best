By the CNN Wire Staff Reporter in Misrata : ` We 're under siege ' NEW : Offshore communications cable reportedly cut Ship takes nearly 1,000 migrants and 17 casualties from Misrata to Benghazi ` ` It 's just hell , '' says a reporter in Misrata NATO 's ` ` message '' was ` ` sent to the wrong address , '' a government spokesman says Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Libyan government forces directed their assault <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2011-04-25">Monday</TIMEX3> on civilian areas of Misrata , resulting in a number of civilian casualties , witnesses said .
` ` It 's just hell , '' said Marie Colvin , a foreign affairs correspondent for the <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-04-24">Sunday</TIMEX3> Times of London , who has been in the city for <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P1W">a week</TIMEX3> .
` ` Civilian neighborhoods are being decimated as we speak . ''
She said that at least 10 people had been killed and at least 30 others wounded .
But figures were difficult to confirm ; CNN was not in the city .
A resident of Misrata who asked to be identified only as Mohammed said <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2011-04-25">Monday</TIMEX3> that six people were killed in the morning .
Building frequented by Gadhafi hit A doctor at a hospital in Misrata put the number of dead <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011-04-24">Sunday</TIMEX3> at 16 , with 71 wounded .
The indiscriminate shelling began after rebel forces routed forces loyal to leader Moammar Gadhafi from the city center <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2011-04-24" mod="START">early Sunday</TIMEX3> , Colvin said .
The rout came after rebels moved from building to building along Tripoli Street , the main boulevard , ousting government forces , she said .
Twenty - five rebels were killed in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P1D">one day</TIMEX3> , and an undetermined number of Gadhafi soldiers were killed , she said .
Asked about the rebel army , she laughed .
` ` We 're talking about an army of shopkeepers , engineers , car mechanics , '' she said .
` ` Very , very few trained military . ''
At the fruit and vegetable market , government tanks that had been hidden under loading bays were set afire over <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2011-W16-WE">the weekend</TIMEX3> .
Their position there underscored the difficulty of NATO airstrikes in discriminating between government forces and civilians .
Since then , stationed on the city 's edge , government forces have been firing shells randomly into residential neighborhoods of the city , she said .
` ` It 's a free - fire zone on civilians , '' she said from the hospital , where she said she had seen casualties that ranged ` ` from loss of limbs to an 8 - year - old boy struck in the ankle by shrapnel .
He 'll keep the foot , but he was in bad shape . ''
Outside , a white tent served as a triage area ; a refrigerator truck was packed with bodies .
When two people were killed in one house , the family got into a car , but it too was hit , killing a man and two children , she said .
Almost all of the shops in the city were shut , she said .
Along Tripoli Street , ` ` every single building has been hit by shells . ''
Some bakery owners were giving away bread , and a few stores on the other side of town remained open , she said .
As of <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="TIME" value="2011-04-25TNI">Monday night</TIMEX3> , the seaside city remained surrounded on three sides , she said .
<TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2011-W16">Last week</TIMEX3> , Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Khaim said that Gadhafi 's military was withdrawing from Misrata and that tribal leaders would deal with the rebels .

But rebel commanders told Colvin that there were no negotiations going on between them and tribal leaders , the reporter said .
The government 's assertion that such talks were ongoing ` ` appears to be a fig leaf or Gadhafi trying to cover the fact that his troops have been defeated , '' Colvin said .
Misrata has been the scene of some of the deadliest battles of the war as rebels attempt to oust Gadhafi , who has been in power for <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="P42Y">42 years</TIMEX3> .
At least 36 people were killed there <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2011-04-24">Sunday</TIMEX3> , rebel spokesman Col . Ahmad Bani said <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2011-04-25">Monday</TIMEX3> .
In all , hundreds of people have been killed in the battle for the city , which has been under siege by Gadhafi 's forces for <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="P7W">seven weeks</TIMEX3> .
Its population of about 450,000 makes it the country 's third - largest city .
But that number has been dropping as residents have sought to get out .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2011-04-25">Monday</TIMEX3> , the International Organization for Migration said it had taken nearly 1,000 stranded migrants -- most of them from Nigeria -- and 17 civilian casualties from Misrata to Benghazi on <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2011-04-24">Sunday</TIMEX3> , with more such efforts planned .
The accounts of dire conditions in Misrata came as a government official said Gadhafi was well and in command of the country 's affairs , despite what the official called a NATO attempt to kill him by bombing his compound in the capital city of Tripoli .
` ` The message that was sent by NATO in the early hours of <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="TIME" value="2011-04-25TMO">this morning</TIMEX3> was sent to the wrong address , '' Mussa Ibrahim said in a written statement .
In a tour of the aftermath , Ibrahim said the flattened structure was a civilian office building .
In a statement , NATO said the target was a communications center in central Tripoli that had been used to coordinate attacks against civilians .
NATO is leading an international military operation in Libya that includes airstrikes targeting Gadhafi 's military resources .
It is operating under a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing the use of force to protect civilians .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2011-04-25">Monday</TIMEX3> , Italy 's Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi called U.S. President Barack Obama to tell him of his decision to provide additional military support by authorizing air - to - ground strikes on Libyan regime targets , the White House said in a statement .
` ` The two leaders agreed that additional pressure is necessary to strengthen the civilian protection mission , and the president emphasized that the best way to ensure the safety of the Libyan people is for Gadhafi to leave power , '' the statement said .
Libyan state TV said military and civilian casualties resulted from the strike on Gadhafi 's Bab el - Azizia compound .
` ` We have no independent means of verifying reports of possible civilian casualties , '' NATO said in a statement on its website .
NATO has been issuing warnings to Libyan civilians to stay away from military sites and equipment , especially around Misrata .
Citing a military source , state - run Libyan TV reported <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2011-04-25" mod="END">late Monday</TIMEX3> that NATO ships struck an offshore fiber - optic cable , cutting communications to Sirte , Ras Lanuf and al - Brega .
It also reported that air strikes hit targets <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="TIME" value="2011-04-25TNI">Monday night</TIMEX3> in Zawiya and Ayn Zarah of Tripoli district , resulting in casualties .
Since NATO took command of Operation Unified Protector on <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2011-03-31">March 31</TIMEX3> , its aircraft have flown more than 3,700 sorties and more than 1,500 strike sorties .
Over <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2011-W16-WE">the weekend</TIMEX3> , NATO aircraft destroyed multiple - rocket launchers , armored personnel carriers , bunkers and storage facilities in and around Misrata , Tripoli and Sirte , the alliance said .
` ` We are bringing all our capabilities to bear on all parts of the Gadhafi regime that remain intent on harming the civilian population , '' NATO spokeswoman Oana Lungescu said in a statement .
` ` As decided by the foreign ministers of NATO and operational partners , we will keep up the pressure until all attacks against civilians have stopped , Gadhafi 's forces have withdrawn to bases , and full and unimpeded humanitarian access has been ensured . ''
The rebels , under the umbrella of the Transitional National Council , received a pledge <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="2011-04-24">Sunday</TIMEX3> from Kuwait for about $ 180 million .
The announcement came during council chief Mustafa Abdel Jalil 's visit to Kuwait , Kuwaiti state - run television reported .
