By James M. Lindsay - Special to CNN <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DURATION" value="P2M" mod="MORE_THAN">More than two months</TIMEX3> of bombing make it clear that the United States and its NATO allies are seeking to oust Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi .
The air war , however , is not producing the quick result that NATO wanted .
President Obama continues to resist European calls for a greater American commitment .
He argues for sitting tight the air war will eventually force Gadhafi from power .
Public opinion polls explain Obama s reluctance to do more <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3> Americans take a dim view of the operation .
A new Quinnipiac University Poll finds that 57 percent of Americans don t think that the United States should be involved in Libya .
Democrats and Republicans are equally unenthusiastic .
But sitting tight requires patience that Americans and Europeans may not have .

If domestic opposition to the air war grows , Gadhafi and his supporters might gain confidence that he can hang on , thereby undermining the bombing campaign .
What steps could the administration take if it decides that the <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> air war isn t working , or working fast enough ?
Obama has repeatedly ruled out sending in U.S. combat troops .
Given the American public s intervention fatigue , he isn t likely to change his mind .
So what might he do instead ?
Here are five possibilities : 1 -RRB- Seek a negotiated solution .
Washington could cut a deal with Gadhafi that imposes a ceasefire or sends him into exile .
The Libyan dictator looks to be searching for such a deal .
Obama has said it is impossible to imagine a future for Libya with Gadhafi in power .
So any deal that allows him or his sons to continue ruling , which is what a ceasefire would do , would be seen as a substantial defeat .
2 -RRB-
Arm the Rebels .
Obama has authorized sending Libyan rebels $ 25 million worth of nonlethal equipment like body armor and uniforms .
The British , French , and Italians have gone slightly further , providing some military advisers .
Sending military arms might tip the balance in the fighting because airstrikes have seriously degraded Gadhafi s military forces .
Arming the rebels does not guarantee a quick victory .
Sophisticated weapons require training to use , and that training can take months .
Washington also worries that weapons sent to Libyan rebels <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2011-05-27">today</TIMEX3> could end up in the hands of anti - U.S. forces <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2011-05-28">tomorrow</TIMEX3> .
3 -RRB- Ask NATO allies to do more .
Obama has pushed Britain and France to lead the air war .
They have grumbled but complied .
France has begun dispatching attack helicopters to Libya , and Britain is considering the move .
Washington can insist they do even more .
How much more NATO allies can and will do , though , is an open question .
The capacity of some contributing countries is already being tested , and European capitals share Washington s reluctance to wade deeper into Libya .
So pushing Europe to do more could strain the transatlantic alliance 4 -RRB-
Expand the air war .
NATO could expand its target list to put more pressure on Gadhafi s supporters .
It also could use airpower to support rebel fighters on the ground .
Britain and France want the United States to commit roughly ten close air support aircraft to the fight .
These AC-130 and A-10 planes were used early in the fighting to destroy Gadhafi s tanks .
<TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P2M">Two months</TIMEX3> of bombing have destroyed most of Libya s militarily significant targets .
Gadhafi s forces <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> avoid airstrikes by hiding amongst civilians .

Widening the target set or sending in close air support aircraft risks killing more civilians and undermining domestic support for the air war .
5 -RRB- Send in Special Forces .
Navy SEALs raided Osama bin Laden s compound in Abbottabad , Pakistan .
They could try to replicate that feat in Tripoli .
The Abbottabad raid worked because the United States had exceptional intelligence on bin Laden s whereabouts as well as the element of surprise .
Precise information about Gadhafi s location is hard to come by , and Special Forces wouldn t have surprise working for them .
A raid that turned into Blackhawk Down rather than Abbottabad would hand Gadhafi a major political victory .
Even as Obama struggles with how to push out Gadhafi , he has to contemplate a bigger challenge : what to do once he is gone .
Iraq offers a cautionary lesson that it is far easier to topple dictators than it is to install just and effective governments .
I ' ve got a 6th option ... US pulls ALL of our military out of every ungrateful , terrorist harboring sespool on this planent & we take care of our own .
Let India & pakistan blow each other up , Let Korea blow itself up , & let Isreal do what ever they want to the other middle eastern countries that are trying to destroy there soverignty .

Reply I sympathize with the idea of pulling all U.S. troops out of these quagmires .

But remember that , while they may not deserve our help and do n't appreciate it , it may do us more harm than good in the long run to abandon them .
It 's satisfying to consider , but there are complex repercussions if we do .
Also , be careful about the argument from ` ` national sovereignty '' .
Nations may be sovereign in comparison to OTHER nations , but only individual human beings are truly Sovereign .
A nation has NO right to oppress it 's own people by violating their sovereignty .
It may not be in our best interest to defend the rights of individuals in other countries against their own governments , but ` ` national sovereignty '' is NOT a valid excuse for failing to do so .

Reply It is good to protect civilians from these cruel dictators .
However , in Libya we are seeing invasion , destruction and imperialism because if that was the case , then how about those civilians in Yemen , Bahrain and elsewhere ?
In Egypt people were encouraged to avoid confrontation and taking weapons otherwise Mubarak would have crashed them and US , Europe would have backed him as they are doing so in Bahrain and Yemen .
Without encouraging opposition in Libya that I sympathized with at the beginning to take weapons , Muammar Qaddafi would have gone <TIMEX3 tid="t39" type="DATE" value="2011-05-27">today</TIMEX3> and the number of casualties would not have reached the figures we have <TIMEX3 tid="t40" type="DATE" value="2011-05-27">today</TIMEX3> .

Reply You 'll bet that Britain & France will be the biggest beneficiaries in Libya financially and politically -LRB- and to a lesser extent the US & Italy
-RRB- when Gadhafi is gone .
In fact , they have already gained in many respects as they got to test their weaponry plus dump all their older bombs , missiles etc etc on Gadhafi 's military .
Then they hit Libyan 's infrastructures\/residences just by labeling them command and control structures coupled with the NLC rebels and Gadhafi 's forces madly destroying each other 's cities like in Misrata .
When the civil war ends the Brits and French will get billions of juicy contracts to replace Libya with new tanks , fighter jets , warships , civil contracts etc etc with Libyan 's oil and huge frozen foreign reserves .
Diplomacy is not a lucrative option .
Politically , Nato will earn the title of liberator and for democracy .
Hip Hooray to the 3 Musketeers . .
leave it to them to do the cleverest of things .

Libya is a nonstarter and should be left to its electors to sought out .
Already the onset of the conflict was an unconsidered rush of France and Britain , which led to the <TIMEX3 tid="t157" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> situation .
A sensible thing to do is to let the UN deploy peace forces and set up a buffer zone .
This will scale down all those air - strikes , that terrorise the populace and minimize further losses of lives .
A diplomatic solution is the only answer to resolve the stalemate over this civil war .

Reply You are correct that we never should have gone in .
However , we did so to back up our allies in EU .
If we pull out , they will pull out of Afghanistan .
The whole thing is a real mess .
All of this goes back to W 's massive screw - up with Afghanistan .
Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world .
While our government is bombing the 7 million people of Libya , Mr White here is worried about how much money is being spent on killing people .
Do n't you worry Mr White , it will be paid for by Libya 's frozen assets that our government stole from them , the biggest theft ever in human history .

Turning a blind eye to allow Gaddafi to butcher his people that oppose his families rule of Libya and then turning around buying oil from him would be what China would do ...
At least we , the U.S. , is on the right side this time ...
It would be nice to believe that this campaign will also help the UN in the future to be taken more serious by other dictators when the UN warns them to stop killing peaceful protestors .
By not completing this campaign and then to remove Gaddafi , strips away any perceived authority of the UN and I would not expect any future dictator to take warnings seriously .

Gaddafi did NOT kill his people , the proof is already out .
It 's all a BIG LIE , just like every other US attack on another country .
Gaddafi is a national hero and a good man , whether you PIGS like it or not .

How can anyone just sit there and watch a 70 yr - old leader and his family being threatened with assasination .
The US and NATO bastards already killed Gaddafi 's son and 3 grandchildren with 4 bombs on their house .
Four bombs on a house with kids ?
Please people , you either speak the truth or just find something else to do .
You are far from righteous or noble when you support such an attack on a small defenseless country , on the good man that Gaddafi is and what he did for the country for 41 yrs , etc . .

Reply I 'd suggest committing to the power of Satyagraha or ` ` truth force . ''
This showed up in the largely nonviolent resistance strategies <TIMEX3 tid="t308" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> in Egypt and Tunisia , but also against hostile rulers that used violence to repress in the Phillippines -LRB- Marcos -RRB- <TIMEX3 tid="t304" type="DATE" value="1986">1986</TIMEX3> , Serbia -LRB- Milosevic -RRB- <TIMEX3 tid="t305" type="DATE" value="1999">1999</TIMEX3> - <TIMEX3 tid="t306" type="DATE" value="2000">2000</TIMEX3> , India -LRB- British -RRB- <TIMEX3 tid="t307" type="DATE" value="1930">1930</TIMEX3> 's , and the numerous color revolutions .

Denmark , Norway -RRB- .
Encourage and teach the uprising about a commitment to this kind of ` ` force . ''
This is the best long - term strategy and best for becoming better humans .
Gene Sharp has outlined at least 198 NV strategies and more exist if we commit our imagination to it .

Reply My assesment of the situation in Libya is that Gadhafi will not step down from power , nor will he accept any kind of ceasefire agreement where the rebels retain control of the eastern half of Libya .
In that case , NATO will eventually have to commit ground forces to secure Misrata and push Gadhafi out of power .
Even if that means a small US presence in Libya , I would prefer to leave it up to professionals as opposed to arming the resistance directly .

Reply I still have a difficult time understanding our country 's foreign policy strategy .
Let 's take some examples .
Iran , Syria , Sudan have been our shit list for ages .

But when people in both countries rebelled and demanded democracy we did not stand by then .
They were shot , tortured and massacred in hordes .
But we stood by and watched it all happen .
It is still happening in Syria .
Have you seen the papers lately ?
What have we done for the guys who are fighting for democracy in Syria .
It seems our foreign policy is based on 1 -RRB- how do we benefit , 2 -RRB- how do we look good to the world 3
-RRB- what requires the least amount of USA human loss .

If the answer to all these questions is YES , we go to war .
I am not a big fan of Gadhafi , but this is a little extreme .
First of all , we are not at war with Libya or the Gadhafi regime at this time .
We are supporting a NATO action there .
The situation in Syria is also very bad and should have been addressed already by the UN .
I would support limited US involvment in Syria before it 's too late .
I agree that our foreign policy is dubious , but I think that President Obama is doing as well as possible to improve foreign policy .
However , if the man wants a second term he will have to work on domestic issues like the struggling economy and gradual decline in the quality of education in the United States .

Reply No one would argue the defense of Benghazi was necessary , but to use Benghazi as a starting pistol for the unrelenting attacks on Gaddafi forces -LRB- at least 50 % made up of conscripts with little choice but to fight -RRB- , without at least a break for mediation , could be argued to be a drastic measure , and one that stretches the mandate given to NATO under Resolution 1973 to the extreme .
Resolution 1973 clear purpose was to protect civilians not to support one side in a civil war , in this case an armed rebel force .
We must find a better way to resolve conflicts in <TIMEX3 tid="t348" type="DATE" value="20">the 21st Century</TIMEX3> rather than bombing from 10,000 feet .
We in the West have enormous political and military power , but the sign of truly Just and civilised nations are those that have power but choose only to use ultimate force when deemed the only possible solution .
Clearly the Clinton administration failed abysmally over Rwanda and Bosnia , and that s not said in hindsight , it was obvious before the genocide really got going , but it is inappropriate to cite these two horrendous intent to slaughter with Libya .
President Obama s , less than enthusiastic support of NATO s strategy , -LRB- in my opinion -RRB- is I think a sign of a man that is struggling to justify fully the actions <TIMEX3 tid="t349" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> being taken , and that is to be commended .
We need a thinker in the White House .
Last time I checked , Obama reluctantly cooperated with implementing a no - fly - zone for NATO .
If the US wanted Gadhafi out of power , he would have been ousted already .

Tell big enough lies and the people will believe anything .
glorifying a bunch of terrorists attacking the government of Libya and calling them the legitimate government ?
is supporting terrorism , the very thing the US destroyed Iraq and Afganistan for .
Who are the real terrorists ?
America is NOT the America that once stood up for what is right but has become a tool in the hands of the big money boys .
The US presidency is compromised .
America , , take back your country . .

Every bomb that falls on lIbya is financed by debt and it represents a nail in our coffin .
We have wasted $ 5 Trillion in <TIMEX3 tid="t498" type="DURATION" value="P10Y">10 years</TIMEX3> to fight Osama 's few hundred followers .
Osama 's plan was to banrupt America by drawing it into war in Muslim countries .
America 's fatal love affair with Israel and the $ 3.5 billion debt dollars that it gives it in aid , got us involved in the Israeli - Muslim conflict .
In my blog I explain how over 50 % of American military forces are war contractors and have the official government statistics .
Two third of the war contractor employees are foreigners .
How well will they fight in a real hot war like Vietnam ?
In my blog I tell the truth about the war contractor multi - Trillion dollar business Note that as Congress has not issued a declaration of war as required by Art .
8 of the Constitution , this war is illegal in the first place .
Obama 's excuse has been that it 's not a ` ` real war '' because there are no ground troops , which has no legal basis .
Sending in ground troops without Congressional authorization would be grounds for impeachment .

It is indeed the ` ` Arab '' <TIMEX3 tid="t505" type="DATE" value="2011-SP">Spring</TIMEX3> not the Tunisian <TIMEX3 tid="t506" type="DATE" value="2011-SP">Spring</TIMEX3> or the Egyptian <TIMEX3 tid="t507" type="DATE" value="2011-SP">Spring</TIMEX3> nor even the Syrian <TIMEX3 tid="t508" type="DATE" value="2011-SP">Spring</TIMEX3> .
In every country the long term goals are primarily two .
Greater political freedom and greater economic opportunities for millions of unemployed .
As it stands <TIMEX3 tid="t509" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> some countries are on the edge of being able to deliver on the promise of the first .
As for the second , substantial economic progress , this is <TIMEX3 tid="t510" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> a distant goal at best for all countries involved .
As long as their is no clear idea of what the endgame will be in Libya , Palestine and Syria , there will never be the investment needed to fulfill the needs of those countries as well as Egypt and Tunisia .
Thus the ` ` Arab '' <TIMEX3 tid="t511" type="DATE" value="2011-SP">Spring</TIMEX3> is in danger of being still born .
There is also the reality that the major parties on both sides of these ` ` revolutions '' are going to have to make peace to make any progress going forward .
Not an easy task .
The solution to this problem may also be Israels chance to solve it 's long standing impasse with the Palestinians .
The only way any one country involved in the Arab <TIMEX3 tid="t515" type="DATE" value="2011-SP">Spring</TIMEX3> will be able to deliver dramatically on BOTH goals demanded of their citizens is for all those countries to become one .
Tunisia needs to vote to join the Libyan rebels , not as allies , but as fellow long term countrymen .
The same is true for Egypt .
Together the first step can be reached .
A non NATO led liberation of the three as one .

A gesture such as agreeing to put the combined capital of the three in Al Bayda Libya is the type of compromise needed time and time again going forward .
However , the ability to also transfer various members of armed forces , civil servants and such to other parts of the combined country will ease tensions among the <TIMEX3 tid="t516" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> warring parties for years to come .
The combined economic expertise , natural resource revenues and large potential domestic markets for goods , backed by direct foreign investment should spur growth as never before in the combined region .
Just as countless Arab governments have for millennium , the drafting of outside leadership to come and rule a country as capable but neutral parties could rarely be needed more than in this case .
Thus , while not in anywhere near the brink of chaos as it 's neighbors , the obvious choices to lead the newly formed combined countries , and indeed to join the new entity would be King Abdullah II of Jordan and the likes of Munib R. Masri of Palestine as the original Prime Minister could form the type of government needed to both provide long term stability as a constitutional monarchy but also with a leader of government respected throughout the entire combined countries of the region .
The over riding theme of the unification is the willingness of each national sovereign nation to re identify themselves as members of a new country for the good of the common whole .
The new theme of ` ` I am doing this not only for me but for the good of countless millions of fellow countrymen so that I might provide political and economic equality for myself and my extended family and tribe '' has not had such an opportunity for perhaps decades .
Which leads , if one has not already surmised , the unique opportunity to bring millions of Palestinians to the same goal .
` ` If we wish a better life we are <TIMEX3 tid="t517" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> Libyans -LRB- or whatever the agreed upon name -RRB- and Arabs and we have a chance to move forward under new leadership to create a new future for ourselves and our future generations '' .
Thus a united Tunisia , Libya , Egypt , Jordan and Palestine could become the model for other ` ` endgames '' to other nations of not only the Arab world but for sub Saharan Africa and other regions of the world .

Reply Its a nice thought
but wishful thinking .
It will not last .
Maybe in <TIMEX3 tid="t531" type="DURATION" value="P50Y">50 years</TIMEX3> it 's possible .
For <TIMEX3 tid="t532" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> Come home let them settle it on their own --
Fix America first .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t536" type="DURATION" value="P20Y">20 years</TIMEX3> Afghanistan will be controlled by radicals and we will be 1.5 trn poorer for our effort .
When we captured Sadam and his cronies we needed to come home .
If the Iraq people want freedom they need to do it themselves or they do not deserve it .
If they earn it they will hang on to it as we did .
