'' \nAbu Bakr , the brother of the slain woman , wept through the funeral . \nHe pulled back the blankets covering the two small coffins bearing the bloody bodies of his nephews , Mohamed , 5 , and Motez , 3 . \n`` Whether you like it or not , we 're staying here , '' he yelled . \n`` This is our country . '' \nHe damned NATO and `` the rats , '' the Libyan regime 's word for the rebels . \nBack in Qawalish , al Saidy , the sapper , leaves the minefields to return to his vehicle . \nHe knows there is no end date yet for his risky work . \n`` The more we advance , the more landmines we are facing , '' he said . \nBut at least on this day , there 's good news . \nCNN 's Michael Holmes reported from Qawalish and Tiji and Ivan Watson reported from Zlitan . \nJomana Karadsheh contributed to this report . \n"}

{"id": "224", "time": "2011-03-28", "text": "President Obama 's speech about U.S. military involvement in Libya lasted about 30 minutes and consisted of approximately 3,360 words . \nIf you missed it , here 's what you need to know from the speech -- all in `` just '' 1,350 words . \n\\*\\* please note : this is an edited down version of the president 's speech , as prepared for delivery \\*\\* Good evening . \nTonight , I d like to update the American people on the international effort that we have led in Libya what we have done , what we plan to do , and why this matters to us Mindful of the risks and costs of military action , we are naturally reluctant to use force to solve the world s many challenges . \nBut when our interests and values are at stake , we have a responsibility to act . \nThat is what happened in Libya over the course of these last six weeks . \nFor more than four decades , the Libyan people have been ruled by a tyrant Moammar Gaddafi . \nHe has denied his people freedom , exploited their wealth , murdered opponents at home and abroad , and terrorized innocent people around the world including Americans who were killed by Libyan agents . \nLast month , Gaddafi s grip of fear appeared to give way to the promise of freedom . \nIn cities and towns across the country , Libyans took to the streets to claim their basic human rights . \nFaced with this opposition , Gaddafi began attacking his people . \nTen days ago , having tried to end the violence without using force , the international community offered Gaddafi a final chance to stop his campaign of killing , or face the consequences . \nRather than stand down , his forces continued their advance , bearing down on the city of Benghazi At this point , the United States and the world faced a choice We knew that if we waited one more day , Benghazi a city nearly the size of Charlotte could suffer a massacre that would have reverberated across the region and stained the conscience of the world . \nIt was not in our national interest to let that happen . \nI refused to let that happen . \nAnd so nine days ago , after consulting the bipartisan leadership of Congress , I authorized military action to stop the killing and enforce UN Security Council Resolution 1973 . \nWe struck regime forces approaching Benghazi to save that city and the people within it And tonight , I can report that we have stopped Gaddafi s deadly advance . \nTo summarize , then : in just one month , the United States has worked with our international partners to mobilize a broad coalition , secure an international mandate to protect civilians , stop an advancing army , prevent a massacre , and establish a No Fly Zone with our allies and partners . \nTo lend some perspective on how rapidly this military and diplomatic response came together , when people were being brutalized in Bosnia in the 1990s , it took the international community more than a year to intervene with air power to protect civilians . \nMoreover , we have accomplished these objectives consistent with the pledge that I made to the American people at the outset of our military operations . \nI said that America s role would be limited ; that we would not put ground troops into Libya ; that we would focus our unique capabilities on the front end of the operation , and that we would transfer responsibility to our allies and partners . \nTonight , we are fulfilling that pledge . \nOur most effective alliance , NATO , has taken command of the enforcement of the arms embargo and No Fly Zone . \nLast night , NATO decided to take on the additional responsibility of protecting Libyan civilians . \nThis transfer from the United States to NATO will take place on Wednesday . \nIn that effort , the United States will play a supporting role . . \nBecause of this transition . \nthe risk and cost of this operation to our military , and to American taxpayers will be reduced significantly . \nDespite the success of our efforts over the past week , I know that some Americans continue to have questions about our efforts in Libya . \nGaddafi has not yet stepped down from power , and until he does , Libya will remain dangerous . \nMoreover , even after Gaddafi does leave power , forty years of tyranny has left Libya fractured and without strong civil institutions . \nThe transition to a legitimate government that is responsive to the Libyan people will be a difficult task . \nAnd while the United States will do our part to help , it will be a task for the international community , and more importantly a task for the Libyan people themselves . \nIn fact , much of the debate in Washington has put forward a false choice when it comes to Libya . \nOn the one hand , some question why America should intervene at all even in limited ways in this distant land . \nIt is true that America can not use our military wherever repression occurs . \nAnd given the costs and risks of intervention , we must always measure our interests against the need for action . \nBut that can not be an argument for never acting on behalf of what s right . \nIn this particular country Libya ; at this particular moment , we were faced with the prospect of violence on a horrific scale . \nSome nations may be able to turn a blind eye to atrocities in other countries . \nThe United States of America is different . \nAnd as President , I refused to wait for the images of slaughter and mass graves before taking action . \nNow , just as there are those who have argued against intervention in Libya , there are others who have suggested that we broaden our military mission beyond the task of protecting the Libyan people , and do whatever it takes to bring down Gaddafi and usher in a new government . \nOf course , there is no question that Libya and the world will be better off with Gaddafi out of power . \nI , along with many other world leaders , have embraced that goal , and will actively pursue it through non-military means . \nBut broadening our military mission to include regime change would be a mistake If we tried to overthrow Gaddafi by force , our coalition would splinter . \nWe would likely have to put U.S. troops on the ground , or risk killing many civilians from the air . \nThe dangers faced by our men and women in uniform would be far greater . \nSo would the costs , and our share of the responsibility for what comes next . \nTo be blunt , we went down that road in Iraq . \nThanks to the extraordinary sacrifices of our troops and the determination of our diplomats , we are hopeful about Iraq s future . \nBut regime change there took eight years , thousands of American and Iraqi lives , and nearly a trillion dollars . \nThat is not something we can afford to repeat in Libya . \nAs Commander-in-Chief , I have no greater responsibility than keeping this country safe . \nAnd no decision weighs on me more than when to deploy our men and women in uniform . \nThere will be times , though , when our safety is not directly threatened , but our interests and values are In such cases , we should not be afraid to act but the burden of action should not be America s alone . \nAs we have in Libya , our task is instead to mobilize the international community for collective action . \nBecause contrary to the claims of some , American leadership is not simply a matter of going it alone and bearing all of the burden ourselves . \nReal leadership creates the conditions and coalitions for others to step up as well ; to work with allies and partners so that they bear their share of the burden and pay their share of the costs ; and to see that the principles of justice and human dignity are upheld by all . \nMy fellow Americans , I know that at a time of upheaval overseas when the news is filled with conflict and change it can be tempting to turn away from the world . \nBut let us also remember that for generations , we have done the hard work of protecting our own people , as well as millions around the globe . \nWe have done so because we know that our own future is safer and brighter if more of mankind can live with the bright light of freedom and dignity . \nTonight , let us give thanks for the Americans who are serving through these trying times , and the coalition that is carrying our effort forward ; and let us look to the future with confidence and hope not only for our own country , but for all those yearning for freedom around the world . \nThank you , God Bless you , and may God Bless the United States of America . \nTunisia , Egypt , Libya Protests , and the likes , share one thing in common . \nIt would boil down to unstoppable wave and movement of freedom . \nMarch 29 , 2011 at 12:43 am | Reply March 29 , 2011 at 12:59 am | Reply I am a long time CNN fan , but was most frustrated with tonight 's `` covrerage '' of the President 's speech on Libya . \nIn particular John King , normally a smart man and equally savvy Wolf Blitzer tortured us and their guests respectively with the same questions . \nI lost respect for their repetitious harranging of Fareed Zakaria and Wesley Clark , who both made outstanding and insightful comments on the speech . \nMore of them as commentators please particularly on this subject , and John and Wolf , how many times can you ask the same question ? \nSituations like what is happening in the region are by definition fluid and to not appreciate nuances is incomprehensible . \nHow can one expect an `` exit strategy '' while the situation is unfolding by the hour and not the day ? \nYou two sounded like GOP `` plants '' in your less than subtle criticism of the President not being more specific . \nit is not good for Americans , who have been `` dumbed down '' enought by the likes of black and white sound bite thinkers . \nYou 're better than that ... at least I hope that this was an off night . \nAs a political `` junkie '' I was so appalled by you two in particular that not only did it seem as if iwas in the movie `` Groundhog Day , '' but I had to go to Law and Order re-runs just to settle down . \nAnd with that I 'll rest my case . \nMarch 29 , 2011 at 1:17 am | Reply The Democrats pounded President Bush for years , asking why he have entered two wars without an exit strategy . \nI is only true that we should ask the same of the Democrat President . \nMarch 30 , 2011 at 3:01 pm | Reply This was a perfect speech outlining the most intelligent path any US president could possibly take and have taken regarding intervention in Libya . \nThere is no height of praise that overstates President Obama 's valor in his approach to helping the world and the Libyan people in the past days . \nIt was absolutely optimal . \nI am glad I am not a republican struggling to find some modicum of error in President Obama 's choices to advance my own political position . \nI would open my mouth and whatever contradictory words seeped out would make me feel like an idiot . \nMarch 29 , 2011 at 3:09 am | Reply I was satisfied with the speach he said exactly what I felt this mission was about in the first place . \nI had no false ideas and knew the presidant would get critizided from all sides . \nHe is is correct on being a true leader means to create a team a team than can work together and help bear the burden you can witness that in all successful corparations and grat sports team Duh and with this nato team I expect grat things in the world to happen as long as they stick together March 29 , 2011 at 10:11 am | Reply Hypocrite ! \nNow , that it suites his purpose he tells us that American 's do n't turn a blind eye to atrocities . \nHe tells us that our own future is safer and brighter if more of mankind can live with the bright light of freedom and dignity . \nThen why did we do NOTHING when there were mass protests in Iran in 2009 ? \nWhy , when the people of Iran were asking for help & support , for the same freedoms that we say we support around the world , we sat on our hands , did NOTHING , said NOTHING ! \nHypocrisy at it 's very best ! \nMarch 29 , 2011 at 2:59 pm | Reply @ Eli -- It was not President Obama who wanted to go in . \nHe reluctantly did so after the UN decided to intervene . \nSo your question should be to the UN . \nYou can not blame everything on President Obama . \nMarch 29 , 2011 at 9:22 pm | Reply @Eli , evidently the UN nor CONRESS saw fit to intervene ! \nWe as ` blogging politicians ' , evidently did n't PUSH for intervention either ! \nSo who are REALLY the hypocrites ? \nPRESIDENT OBAMA works , if at all possible within the boundaries of the law . \nAMERICA was put in mainly in support of the humanitarian crisis ! \n` He tells us that our own futures are safer and brighter ...

{"id": "356", "time": "2011-03-28", "text": "Gadhafi : Libya 's flamboyant , mercurial ruler By Mike Pearson , For CNN Gadhafi seized control of Libya in the very place where the current tumult is strongest , the city of Benghazi . \nMoammar Gadhafi has ruled Libya for 42 years He took control in a bloodless coup with fellow military officers in 1969 His efforts at a larger world role have often brought harsh international attention to his nation -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Once called the `` mad dog of the Middle East , '' Libya 's often flamboyantly dressed ruler , Moammar Gadhafi , has ruled the north African nation for 42 years . \nBut Libya 's 679,362 square miles and 6.4 million people have rarely seemed enough for Gadhafi , who in 2008 gathered a group of African tribal leaders and had them grant him the lofty title , `` King of Kings . '' \nIt was part of his campaign for a unified Africa -- a single federation with a million-man army at its disposal -- a nation that he , naturally , would serve as president , said Ronald Bruce St. John , the author of seven books on Libya . \n`` The Libyan stage is not enough of a playhouse for Gadhafi . \nIt never has been , '' St. John said . \nGadhafi 's `` King of Kings '' ploy was only another in a string of efforts by the mercurial leader to secure a larger-than-life place for himself on the world stage , efforts that have frequently landed him and his citizens in the harsh glare of an angry international community , according to St. John . \nGadhafi 's growing anger over the rejection of Arab and African leaders and his own growing anti-Western sentiment led him to turn to terrorism in the 1970s and 1980s , said Dirk J. Vandewalle , a Libya expert at Darmouth University . \nIt led to the infamous bombing of a Pan Am flight over Lockerbie , Scotland , in which 270 people died . \n`` Terrorism was a cheap way to get even with the West , '' Vandewalle said . \nGadhafi , who will turn 69 in March , seized control of Libya in the very place where the current tumult seems strongest , the city of Benghazi . \nAs an Army captain , he led a bloodless coup against King Idris on September 1 , 1969 , establishing the Libyan Arab Republic in just two hours , according to GlobalSecurity.org , an independent provider of security information . \nHe established a putative system of direct democracy called Jamahiriya that supposedly allowed the nation 's citizens direct input into their government , St. John said . \nIn reality , the country was sliding into a dictatorship led by Gadhafi , he said . \nIn taking control of the country , he became one of a number of young revolutionaries in the region carrying a strong message of Arab nationalism in the mold of Egyptian President Gamel Abdel Nasser , Vandewalle said . \nAlthough U.S. leaders initially tried working with Gadhafi , it quickly became clear he was an Arab nationalist and relations with the West quickly deteriorated , St. John said . \nBy 1972 , he was urging Muslims to fight Western powers , including the United States and Great Britain , and backing black militants in the United States as he pursued a leadership position in the Arab world , seeking to succeed his political idol , Nasser , who had died in 1972 . \nBut Arab leaders shunned his responses , Vandewalle said , seeing him more as a `` buffoon '' and a `` clown '' than a potential pan-Arab leader . \nThat rejection , his own growing anti-Western sentiment and a lack of criticism within the tightly controlled Libyan political environment led Gadhafi to turn to terrorism , Vandewalle said . \n`` I think it was frustration more than anything else , '' he said . \nIn 1986 , Libya was implicated in the fatal bombing at a West Berlin nightclub that left one American service member dead , prompting U.S. President Ronald Reagan to dub the Libyan leader the `` mad dog of the Middle East . '' \nThe United States bombed targets in Libya in response and imposed economic sanctions . \nTwo years later , Libya was implicated in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 , which exploded over Lockerbie , Scotland . \nIn 1999 , seeking rapprochement with the West , Gadhafi succumbed to Western demands to turn over suspects in the Lockerbie bombing , and in 2003 the country agreed to eliminate weapons of mass destruction . \nThe moves helped the country regain diplomatic relations with the United States in 2006 , but that was n't the end of Gadhafi 's touchy relations with foreign nations . \nIn 2008 , Swiss officials jailed one of Gadhafi 's sons , prompting the furious leader to cut off the country 's oil supplies , withdraw the country 's money from Swiss banks and threaten to cut off diplomatic relations . \nAnd in 2009 , Libya and Gadhafi again became the subject of international ire in 2009 when the government granted a hero 's welcome to Abdel Basset al-Megrahi , who had been convicted in the Lockerbie bombing but was released by Scottish authorities for health reasons . \nWhile his politics have brought the attention of international leaders , it may be Gadhafi 's personal style that has brought him the most awareness around the world . \nGadhafi is known for appearing in public in outrageous , sometimes outlandish , garb , St. John said . \nImages of the Libyan leaders available on the Internet show him dressed in everything from lavishly decorated military uniforms to animal prints . \nGadhafi famously travels with a traditional Bedouin tent , whose appearance in 2009 frustrated officials in Bedford , New York , when he came to New York to address the United Nations . \nHe also travels with a retinue of female bodyguards , St. John noted . \nWhile Gadhafi has a substantial number of enemies within Libya , his use of the county 's enormous oil revenues to provide subsidized health care , education and housing to citizens , as well as his willingness to stand up to the West , granted him a reserve of good will that he still draws on today , said Vandewalle . \n`` This was a young nationalist who stood up to the West , who nationalized the oil companies , who stood up to Great Britain and the United States , '' Vandewalle said . \n`` It was highly symbolic and there are a number of people there who still grudgingly respect him for that .

John McCain : Obama saying regime change wo n't be pursued militarily is `` puzzling '' CNN 's Fareed Zakaria : `` Important '' speech explains U.S. military response is limited Rudolph Giuliani : `` The president 's speech tonight has made things even murkier '' -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In a televised address Monday night , U.S. President Barack Obama explained the reasons he involved the U.S. military in the U.N.-authorized mission in Libya , saying `` it was not in our national interest '' to let the citizens of a rebel stronghold suffer a massacre at the hands of approaching pro-government forces . \nObama also said that NATO would take full control of the military mission on Wednesday . \nFollowing is a collection of reactions from people including U.S. politicians and political analysts . \nU.S. Sen. John McCain , R-Arizona : `` I think that the first part of his speech was excellent , and he laid out the reasons why it was important to intervene and what would have happened in Benghazi . \n... He made a strong case . '' \n`` Then ... he made a very puzzling comment , and that was -LRB- regime change by force -RRB- would be a mistake . \nGadhafi must have been comforted by that . '' \n`` The president 's policy is Gadhafi must go . \nI think there 's a chance , if we keep the pressure on , Gadhafi could be thrown under the bus -LRB- by people surrounding him . -RRB- '' \n`` It 's clear we 're on the side of the rebels in this conflict . \n... -LRB- But -RRB- if we tell Gadhafi , ` Do n't worry , you 're not going to be removed by force , ' I think that 's very encouraging for Gadhafi . '' \nFareed Zakaria , host of CNN 's `` Fareed Zakaria GPS '' : `` It was actually an important speech . \nIt was quite carefully constructed . \nIt had a humanitarian angle , a strategic angle . \nBut at the heart of what Obama is saying is that there are places in the world where the United States does not have vital national interests , where we have not been attacked , but we have limited interests and we 're going to try to find a way to have some kind of limited military response . '' \n`` What John McCain was suggesting -LRB- in the reaction above -RRB- frankly strikes me as a very dangerous argument -- that in a place where we have clearly limited interests , clearly nonvital interests , the United States and the president should -LRB- have -RRB- an open-ended policy of military escalation and say we will do whatever it takes to get Moammar Gadhafi out of office . \nThat is , frankly , the way we got in conflicts like Vietnam . \nIn order to not be humiliated , we could n't back down . '' \nMichael Steel , spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner , R-Ohio : `` The speech failed to provide Americans much clarity to our involvement in Libya . \nNine days into this military intervention , Americans still have no answer to the fundamental question : What does success in Libya look like ? '' \nU.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham , R-South Carolina : `` I thought he did a good job talking about the signal we would send , that we are a values-based people , and stranding by these young people in Libya will serve us well in the future . \nBut the line that really sort of broke my heart was that regime change by force would be a mistake . \nThe goal of this country is to replace Gadhafi . \nIf you look at the balance sheet of what it costs this nation with Gadhafi versus what it costs without him , it is in our interest to get rid of him , and the opposition needs continued military support -- not a ground invasion by the U.S. or any other Western power , but air support -- all the way to Tripoli . '' \n`` If we continue the model we have in place ... -LRB- the rebels -RRB- will win . \nIf we back off , this thing is going to go on for a long time , and a lot of people will die unnecessarily . '' \nAli Suleiman Aujali , former Libyan ambassador to the United States : `` I think it is a great speech . \nThe president was very clear and very determined , and defended his position in a nice way , and I think he convinced the American people . '' \n`` The Americans , they proved to the world they will not only intervene if there -LRB- are -RRB- American interests only , but ... also when human life is in danger . \nThis is a historical decision . \n... We really appreciate what America did for the Libyan people . \nThe Libyan people ... deserve a better government . '' \nRudolph Giuliani , former New York City mayor : `` The president 's speech tonight has made things even murkier than they were before . \nThe whole purpose of this was to clarify our mission . \nOur mission is just internally contradictory . \nThe president says our mission is to protect the people of Libya . \nWell , how do you protect the people of Libya and not be for regime change in Libya ? \nIs n't the danger to the people of Libya Gadhafi ? '' \n`` The president 's speech is illogical . \nIf you were grading this on a Greek logic exam , you 'd give it an F. The speech contradicts itself . \nIt says limited action ; we 're not going to go any further than just protecting the people of Libya ; we 're not going to be for regime change . \nBut you ca n't protect the people of Libya without regime change . \nWhy are we there in the first place ? \nBecause Gadhafi was slaughtering his people . \nHow can you leave him there ? '' \nP.J. Crowley , former U.S. State Department spokesman : `` The president 's policy is to assist in the removal of Moammar Gadhafi . \nThe issue is not with the policy . \nThe issue is the mechanism . \nWe 're acting in a limited manner to level the playing field so the Libyan people themselves and the opposition that has formed , they 'll do that job . \nIt 's not for the United States to impose that from the outside . '' \nFormer New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson : `` I felt the president was very presidential tonight . \nHe explained the purpose : To avert a humanitarian disaster , to protect civilian lives . \nHe even added ... a -LRB- potential -RRB- refugee crisis going to Tunisia and Egypt . '' \n`` I was very satisfied with his speech tonight . \nAgain , consultation with Congress in the days ahead is going to be very important . \nBut he explained the objective , and he explained what he wants to do , and the airstrikes have succeeded . \nAir defenses of Libya have been almost destroyed . \nThe rebels are gaining momentum . \nLook , they 're probably not perfect revolutionary characters , but they 're sure as heck a lot better than Gadhafi staying . \n... I applaud the president tonight . '' \nFouad Ajami , professor of Middle Eastern studies at Johns Hopkins University : `` I think it 's the right thing at last . \nI think the president did a great job . \nI 'm not a fan of President Obama ; I did n't vote for him . \nI think he should have done this much earlier . \nBut ... he finally did it . \nAnd I think he answered the great questions about this intervention . \n... And he told us the truth : This was always about Benghazi . \nIt was about a rescue operation that he was forced to do , and I think it 's the right thing . '' \nAnne-Marie Slaughter , professor of international affairs at Princeton University : `` I think -LRB- Obama -RRB- ... made clear that we went in to avoid what he described as violence on a horrific scale in Benghazi ; that the mandate of the U.N. coalition ... is to protect Libyan civilians . \nI think that makes very clear what success looks like there . \nIt means that Libyan civilians are safe -- safe in their houses , safe in their cities . \nAt the same time , he made very clear that in his U.S. policy -- and the policy of many of our allies -- that Libya needs to have a new government that responds to the demands of the Libyan people , and that we will pursue every diplomatic and economic means to that end . \nAnd leveling the playing field militarily will certainly help . '' \nDavid Gergen , CNN senior political analyst : `` I thought in general -LRB- Obama -RRB- made a compelling case -- a very strong case for intervention itself on humanitarian grounds . \nHe made a compelling case that the United States has helped to organize the international coalition much more rapidly than has happened in the past , as in Bosnia . \nAnd furthermore , I think he made a compelling case that these early U.S. actions really have accomplished what the United States promised to do , and that was to stop Gadhafi from killing other people . \n`` But ... the success of the speech ended there , because he left open all these questions about where we go from here if there 's a stalemate -- and there were signs today that there may be a stalemate . \nWhat are we going to do ? \nWhat is NATO going to do ? \nI do n't think anybody knows that . \nWhat is going to happen if Gadhafi hangs in there for six months ? \nWhat do we do then ? \nWhat happens if Gadhafi gets forced out ? \nWhat happens if the regime cracks and they turn on him -- even assassinate him ? \nWhat 's the United States ' role going to be in building a new Libya ? \nIt thought that was left cloudy , and is going to continue the debate . \n`` But give President Obama his due . \nOn the most important issue that he had to face tonight -- why he went in -- I thought he made a very , very strong case . '' \nAri Fleischer , White House press secretary under President George W. Bush `` The tricky think here is , when you have a president who does the right thing , but who does it four weeks too late , can you really say it is the right thing ? \nThis is really something that should have been done four weeks ago , when it was really likely that the rebels , by virtue of ... a multilateral action , could have tipped the scales and made Gadhafi think ... he needs to get out of there . \nI have a hard time seeing that happen now . \nI think it 's a fight to the finish , and this finish ends up in a stalemate .

'' \nA surface-to-air missile launcher and radar sites were also hit during the strike , which began shortly after midnight Sunday . \nIt was the first time in several days that the alliance targeted Tripoli and its immediate surroundings . \nFood shortages in Western Libya Sunday 's events followed a rally by mounted by pro-Gadhafi rallies in Zawiyah , west of Tripoli , where more than 10,000 portrait-waving demonstrators gathered amid a sea of green flags in the city 's cratered and pock-marked central square . \nZawiyah was the scene of intense fighting last winter , in the early days of the anti-Gadhafi uprising that has left this country bitterly divided . \nGadhafi 's forces eventually succeeded in capturing the city , but recovery appears to have barely begun in its war-torn heart . \nMunicipal buildings and a hotel overlooking the central square still stand gutted , windows broken and facades still singed by fires . \nA vacant lot filled with sand marks the spot where a government minder said a mosque once stood . \nThe mosque was apparently completely bulldozed in the months since Zawiyah was re-captured . \nThe rooftop of a conference center was still littered with sandbags , bullet casings , several military helmets and bottles stuffed with rags apparently for use as petrol bombs -- evidence that rebels fought from this roof before their defeat last winter . \nThe demonstration in Zawiyah , less than a half-hour 's drive from the Libyan capital , was the third pro-Gadhafi rally in as many days . \nBut unlike the previous rallies in the towns of Zlitan and Ajilat , there was a much larger security presence -- and members of the crowd were much more aggressive toward foreign journalists who were bused into the city by government minders . \nThe men , women and children who attended the rally , many of whom traveled by bus and car from nearby Tripoli , appeared fanatically devoted to Gadhafi . \n`` Allah , Moammar -LRB- Gadhafi -RRB- , Libya only , '' chanted many men and women , some of whom beat their chests in devotion as they repeated the slogan . \nAs he had in previous rallies , Gadhafi addressed his supporters with an audio message that denounced the rebel-held enclaves in the west , center and east of the country . \nHe also denounced the foreign governments that recently declared the rebel Transitional National Council , based in the eastern city of Benghazi , as the sole legitimate government in Libya . \n`` You agents , you traitors , start looking for survival , '' Gadhafi said , in comments that were simulcasted on Libyan state TV . \n`` There will be no survival anywhere , get out of Benghazi , you traitors . '' \nSaturday 's rally looked like a victory celebration as well as a declaration to Libya and the rest of the world that Zawiyah was now firmly in Gadhafi 's hands . \nBut there were signs Gadhafi 's forces still had concerns about security in Zawiyah . \nA CNN journalist driving through the city hours before the rally officially took place saw security forces lining up three men who had apparently been detained against a wall . \nAnd the reinforced presence included soldiers and police who used their vehicles to block off side roads leading to the main road running through the city . \n"}

Security Council -LRB- PDF -RRB- United Nations -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Jubilant Libyan rebels in Benghazi erupted with fireworks and gunfire after the U.N. Security Council voted Thursday evening to impose a no-fly zone and permit `` all necessary measures '' to protect civilians . \nThe opposition , with devoted but largely untrained and under-equipped units , has suffered military setbacks this week . \nIt has said such international action was necessary for it to have any chance of thwarting Moammar Gadhafi 's imminent assault on the rebel stronghold . \n`` We 're hoping and praying that the United Nations will come up with a very firm and very fast resolution and they will enforce it immediately , '' said Ahmed El-Gallal , a senior opposition coordinator , before the vote . \n`` We should not arrive too late , '' French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said at the U.N. . \nThe resolution was approved with 10 votes , including those of the United States and the United Kingdom . \nThere were no opposing votes on the 15-member council , but China , Russia , Germany , India and Brazil abstained . \nGermany said it was concerned about a protracted military conflict . \nU.N. member states can `` take all necessary measures ... to protect civilians and civilian populated areas under threat of attack in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya , including Benghazi , while excluding a foreign occupation force , '' according to the resolution . \nMoments after the vote , anti-Gadhafi forces in Benghazi broke into cheers , waving flags and chanting . \nAntiaircraft tracer fire lit up the sky at one rally . \nUN approves no-fly zone in Libya Libyan amb . \nstill hopeful for airstrikes UN okays no-fly zone in Libya It was not immediately clear just how an international military operation and possible strikes against the Libyan military might unfold . \nThe no-fly zone prohibits Libya 's air forces from entering certain zones within the country . \nThe United States and NATO partners have contingencies in place to act within hours , according to an administration official familiar with planning . \nPresident Barack Obama will insist on a major Arab role in any no-fly zone , the official said . \nThe contingencies include air strikes and cruise missile attacks designed to cripple Libyan air defenses and punish military units leading Gadhafi 's push on opposition strongholds in the east , the official said . \nObama called British Prime Minister David Cameron and French President Nicolas Sarkozy after the vote . \nThe three `` agreed that Libya must immediately comply with all terms of the resolution and that violence against the civilian population of Libya must cease , '' the White House said in a statement . \nLibyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim , speaking in Tripoli , told reporters after the vote that the country will safeguard civilians and its territorial integrity . \nHe called on the international community to send a fact-finding mission to the African nation but not lend material support to rebels . \nA few dozen pro-Gadhafi supporters chanted , `` Down with the U.N. ! \nDown with the United States ! '' \nFrustration and anger in Benghazi Libyan rebel : We 've seen heavy gunfire Friedman predicts more unrest in Mideast Gadhafi forces move in on opposition The U.S. military does not view a no-fly zone alone as sufficient to stop Gadhafi . \nAir Force Chief of Staff Gen. Norton Schwartz told a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on Thursday that establishing a zone would take `` upwards of a week . '' \nU.S. military officials have said that a no-fly zone would not halt the heavy artillery the regime is using on the ground . \nGadhafi 's son Saadi told CNN Thursday evening that troops will change their tactics and take up positions around Benghazi Saturday or Sunday and assist people fleeing from the city . \nThe younger Gadhafi said there will be no large-scale assault . \nInstead police and anti-terrorism units will be sent into the rebel stronghold to disarm the opposition . \nUnspecified humanitarian groups can help with the exodus of civilians from Benghazi , Saadi Gadhafi said . \nIn a radio address aired on Libyan state TV , Gadhafi criticized residents of Benghazi and called them `` traitors '' for seeking help from outsiders . \nThe Security Council resolution condemns the `` gross and systematic violation of human rights , including arbitrary detentions , enforced disappearances , torture and summary executions . '' \nIt details enforcement of an arms embargo against Libya , the freezing of assets and a ban on most flights . \n`` The United States stands with the Libyan people in support of their universal rights , '' said U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Susan Rice . \nThe resolution deplores the use of mercenaries by Libyan authorities , expresses concern about the safety of foreign nationals and demands an immediate cease-fire . \nKaim said the Gadhafi government supports a cease-fire , but is working out certain details . \nThe Arab League 's U.N. ambassador , Yahya Mahmassani , said two Arab countries would take part in a no-fly zone operation , but he was not sure which two . \nU.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the Arab League will be critical to the response to Gadhafi , and that he will travel to the region `` to advance our common efforts in this critical hour . '' \nBritish Foreign Secretary William Hague said the U.N. vote shows the need for Libyan citizens `` to have a more representative government . '' \nEarlier Thursday , Libyan state TV said Benghazi would soon come under attack . \nGadhafi said that his forces would enter the city to rid it of those `` traitors '' and that his forces will search everyone for weapons . \nHe added that his forces gave amnesty to those who gave up their weapons in the city of Ajdabiya . \n`` We will not allow further bloodshed among Libyans , '' Gadhafi said . \n`` Search for the traitors , for the fanatics . \nShow them no mercy . \nWe will look for them behind every wall , '' Gadhafi said . \n`` This farce can not go on . '' \nThere were air strikes on Benghazi 's airport Thursday , with three blasts hitting the site about 30 kilometers -LRB- about 18 miles -RRB- outside the city . \nThe opposition has been using the airport to launch its own air strikes , using a handful of jets that rebels have managed to get off the ground , opposition leaders said . \nIt is not clear that Gadhafi 's ground forces are actually within striking range of Benghazi , but they have been fighting their way in that direction for several days . \nState TV claimed Thursday that Gadhafi 's forces were in control of Ajdabiya , on the road to Benghazi , a claim disputed by opposition leaders . \nEl-Gallal , speaking from eastern Libya , said `` morale is high '' and people do not want to leave strongholds because Gadhafi `` is willing to kill everybody here . '' \nThe government forces have taken control of the eastern and western gates to Ajdabiya and are trying to breach the inside , opposition leaders said . \nThe opposition says it controls the southern entrance . \nThe opposition says it has a handful of jets that are no match with Gadhafi 's superior air power and a pair of Russian-made `` Hind '' attack helicopters . \nAjdabiya is the last major point between pro-government forces and Benghazi . \nIf it is retaken by pro-Gadhafi forces , it would give access to roads leading to the heart of the opposition 's base . \nIn remarks to the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee , William Burns , the under secretary for political affairs at the State Department , said Gadhafi 's forces are only about 160 kilometers outside Benghazi . \n`` They 've made advances , taking full advantage of their overwhelming military superiority in military firepower , '' Burns said . \nHe expressed fear that Gadhafi , now isolated by the world community , could turn to terrorism again . \n`` I think there is also a very real danger that if Gadhafi is successful on the ground , that you will also face a number of other considerable risks as well : The danger of him returning to terrorism and violent extremism himself , the dangers of the turmoil that he could help create at a critical moment elsewhere in the region , '' Burns told the committee . \nCNN 's Arwa Damon , Nic Robertson , Tommy Evans , Elise Labott , John King , Alan Silverleib , Raja Razek , Jennifer Rizzo , Joe Vaccarello , Yousuf Basil and Reza Sayah , and journalist Mohamed Fadel Fahmy contributed to this report . \n"}

\nYes I think this will be the last time France intervenes for a LONG time . \nTheir president had better start packing his bags now , because he 's headed the way of Tony Blair . \nBarba , so you want Gadaffi to kill all his people so as to be able to hang on to power , and you want the whole world to turn their head away . \nWhat has he being doing in his 40 + years of ruling . \nHe has nothing more to offer , if he had ever had any . \nPoint Godwin reached immediately by you ... And the point is certainly not there . \nIf this was just for oil , those nations would have treated with Khadaffi regime , like before , because they already have commercial contracts wih Libya -LRB- those commercial contracts will be honored , there 's not been any seizure of equipement or oil , only a freeze on assets that will return to Libyan people as soon as possible -RRB- . \nThe faxt is that Khaddafi has not only threatened his own people , but also renewed his terrorist threats . \nAnd that can not be tolerated . \nWhat happens in Libya was initially a street protest , it is Khadaffi that has forced the evolution into civil war by buying the services of lots of foreign terrorists to attack its opposition . \nAnd that 's why there 's not just a no-fly zone , but more importantly a decision to close the borders of Lybia to avoid invasions of mercenaries paid by Khadaffi , notably in Chad . \nThe most important decision will be to enforce the absence of troup movements from the Southern borders of Libya . \n, and stopping the planes coming from there to South Libya where they are given firearms and heavy equipments to attack the North where most Libyan population lives . \nThose mercenaries must be arrested . \nThey are since the begining the ONLY invaders and foreign forces that have occupied the Libyan territory . \nIn other words , Khaddafi is the main treator of his own country , deliberately acting to threaten his own population that he is normally deemed to protect . \nFor this reason , The no-fly zone will be implemented not just from Mediterranean sea , but also from the South . \nWe can hope the collaboration by Egypt to offer its airports in Southern Egypt to control the Chadian border . \nAnd now the resolution can also help the poor Chadian country to get involved in the alliance and receive help to avoid the damaging action there by current Lybian leaders -LRB- and notably by the Libyan `` ambassador '' in Chad that is no longer acting as a diplomat but as an recruiter -RRB- . \nAnd the money for the Libyan oil or gas must not be used by Khadaffi to pay foreign mercenaries against its people . \nIn fact Khadaffi has lost the opposition to the resolution as soon as he has renewed its terrorist threats , and directly threatened European countries -LRB- including civils -RRB- . \nIt 's clearly unacceptable . \nAnd you 'll immediately note that , in France , despite of the strong political opposition to Sarkhozy -LRB- and the ongoing local elections currently occuring this week -RRB- , even the opposition has supported the no-fly zone and immediate implementation of it . \nThere 's a consensus that the Libyan democratic spring must not be stopped and that the terrorist threats of Khadaffi are completely unacceptable . \nWe have learned from Tunisia and Egypt . \nAnd we already know that we have support from most Arabic populations of the Middle-East . \nClearly the Libyan spring is definitely not a threat for us . \nAnd the Libyan people was the first demander of the no-fly zone . \nIf only Khadaffi had spent its money to help develop Chad instead of buying mercenaries against its own people , the situation would have been radically different . \nKhadaffi resists only to keep power by force . \nNo legitimate country can reject the opinion of its people . \nWhen the situation is so critical that thrre are protests and a new opposition forming , the only legitimate thing that can be done is to organize elections , not war against his oppponents . \nAnd accept to resign and loose . \nBut before this happens , the country leader must still protect his people . \nKhadaffi , by sending mercenaries against his people has clearly acted as a war criminal . \nHe is no longer trustable : he lied in the past , we have given him a limited trust that he woruld fight terrorism and act reasonnably . \nWe can not given him a second chance . \nAnd that 's why France decided to recognize the Parliament of Benghazzi -LRB- even if its still very informal , and still needs to organize itself and prepare its move to organize a new civilian society and regime , with elections -RRB- as the only legitimate representant of the Libyan people because it is the only one that has not threatened any one , inside or outside the country , and offered assistance to help protect humanitarian assistance , or to protect hospitals . \nYou really need to study your history better . \nIt is quite easy to play war if the war zone is away from yr . \n, country !!!! UK ; France , USA , if the playyard would be closer to yr home , you would think twice before entering into a war game . \nWe in Italy are closest to Libya and North-African countries , nobody is helping us dealing with all refugees that arrived lately in Sicily , and our government is playing hard with northern african main-gas-oil-supplier . \nOffering our military basis is not THE SOLUTION ... ... ... ...

'' \nAli accused Gadhafi of launching a `` cowardly , murderous attack . '' \n`` People are not safe . \nIt 's amazing that this is happening , '' Ali said , adding that two people have been killed and 15 injured , one `` very critically . '' \nHe said Gadhafi 's forces had not yet been able to get into the city . \nAli described described himself as a 46-year-old IT engineer and a member of the local opposition council . \nHe called himself a rebel fighter but said he had no weapons . \nThe rebels are fighting with whatever arms they can capture from government troops , he said , such as Kalashnikov rifles . \n`` The best we have '' is rocket-propelled grenade launchers , he said . \nCNN journalists in Libya were not able to reach Misrata to confirm Ali 's account . \nBut a second witness also said the city came under sustained attack by forces loyal to Gadhafi on Wednesday . \nThe tank and artillery fire went on for at least two hours , he said . \n`` We hear very , very , very loud explosions , '' said the witness , who did not want to be named . \n`` They have cut off electricity and water . '' \nMeanwhile , four New York Times journalists covering the conflict were reported missing by the newspaper Wednesday . \nEditors said they had received second-hand information that some of the reporting team `` had been swept up by Libyan government forces '' in Ajdabiya . \nFrustration and anger in Benghazi Ambassador : U.S. , UN must act in Libya Inside a Libyan rebel training camp Resolution intended to pressure Gadhafi Government forces said they had no information about the missing journalists and said that if they were picked up by the Libyan military , they would have been taken back to Tripoli . \nGadhafi 's battles to recapture a number of rebel-held towns and cities come on the day the United Nations Security Council considered imposing a no-fly zone over Libya . \nWednesday ended with no agreement on a draft resolution , but several diplomats expressed optimism that a vote would come soon . \nThe U.S. ambassador to the United Nations said late Wednesday that envoys were considering a variety of options to protect civilians in Libya , not just a no-fly zone or a cease fire . \nSusan Rice said a `` range of actions '' were up for serious discussion , including but not limited to a no-fly zone , which has `` inherent limitations in terms of protection of civilians . '' \nA diplomatic source told CNN that air strikes are among options being discussed as diplomats focus on what should be in a U.N. Security Council resolution . \nThe international community is keenly aware of the urgency and gravity of the situation on ground , Rice continued . \nShe said she hopes to see a serious resolution as early as Thursday . \nThe French Ambassador had earlier confirmed that text for a new draft resolution on Libya had been submitted to diplomats . \nHe also told reporters that he expected a vote on the resolution within 24 hours . \nLebanon 's U.N. ambassador , Nawaf Salam , said Arab countries are committed to participating in a no-fly zone . \nThat has been an apparent prerequisite for U.S. support of such a zone . \nThe Lebanese diplomat would n't detail the level of potential Arab participation but said it would be `` significant '' and said it has `` been confirmed by the highest political authorities . '' \nThe French foreign minister said on his blog Wednesday that several Arab countries would be willing to participate in a targeted attack on Gadhafi 's air assets . \nThe minister , Alain Juppe , did not specify which countries or how they would participate . \nWithout implementation of a no-fly zone , rebels fear that it is only a matter of time before there is a bloodbath in Benghazi . \nLibya 's deputy ambassador to the U.N. expressed this fear Wednesday . \nGadhafi `` has given instructions for ethnic cleansing , '' Ibrahim Dabbashi said , adding that the Libyan leader would commit genocide against rebels if he was not stopped by the international community . \nDabbashi said he expects the Security Council to produce a draft resolution soon . \n`` International consensus is in the process of building , '' Dabbashi said in the Security Council 's briefing room . \nDabbashi made headlines in February when he joined with Libyan Ambassador to the U.N. Mohamed Shalgham to condemn Gadhafi and request that he step down as Libya 's leader . \nLibya 's government has subsequently requested that Dabbashi and Shalgham be denied the right to speak for Libya at the United Nations . \nWomen marched in Benghazi on Wednesday , carrying banners reading , `` how many Libyans must die to get the Security Council to move on . '' \nU.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told reporters Wednesday that opinions in a number of countries initially opposed to the imposition of a no-fly zone shifted after the Arab League announced its support for such a step . \n`` Intense negotiations '' are underway at the Security Council , she said . \n`` We are moving as rapidly as we can to get additional authorization . '' \nA council diplomat said Washington was engaged in negotiations on the text . \nGermany 's U.N. ambassador said his country has still questions about such a zone . \nIndia 's U.N. ambassador asked , `` Who will implement the no-fly zone ? \nWho would provide assets for it ? '' \nChina 's U.N. ambassador said his country is concerned about deteriorating conditions in Libya but did n't say whether Beijing backs a no-fly measure . \nAli , the opposition leader in Misrata , urged China and Russia to `` look in the mirror '' and understand that `` they are hindering the international effort to put this war criminal in his place . '' \nWhile the Arab League recommendation of a no-fly zone carried some weight with reluctant council nations , another declaration from the league that there should be `` no foreign intervention '' has perplexed delegates . \nEn route to Washington after a weekend trip to Bahrain , U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Monday that the logistical challenges of enforcing a no-fly zone over Libya could be overcome . \n`` If we are directed to impose a no-fly zone , we have the resources to do it , '' he said . \n`` The question is whether it 's a wise thing to do . \nAnd that 's the discussion that 's going at a political level .

{"id": "318", "time": "2011-07-27", "text": "There was optimism recently from regime insiders in Tripoli that a deal was in the works British move seen as escalation against Gadhafi Libya insists that a cease-fire must come first Rebels and their Western allies say Gadhafi must go Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Britain 's decision to expel Moammar Gadhafi 's diplomats from London ensures that the bloody test of wills in Libya will grind on for weeks , if not months to come . \nBarely 15 days ago , there was optimism from regime insiders here in Tripoli that a deal was in the works to resolve the five-month conflict . \nPerhaps this was because the Muslim holy month of Ramadan was fast approaching , and with it , an anticipated slow-down in fighting on the front-lines . \nAlso , the regime was engaged in talks on multiple fronts with its European , American , and Libyan opponents . \nDevelopments over the last two weeks appear to have killed those hopes . \nFirst , the United States joined the growing list of countries officially declaring the rebel council based in Benghazi the `` legitimate governing authority for Libya . '' \nA day after Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made the announcement in Istanbul , Turkey , the message was personally delivered during a round of secret talks in Tunisia . \nThe Americans said they had one message for the Libyans , `` Gadhafi must go . '' \nAt roughly the same time , the Benghazi-based rebels mounted an attack on the eastern front , against the long-contested oil town of al-Brega . \nGadhafi 's main spokesman accused the NATO military alliance of assisting rebels in the assault . \nHe also drew a rhetorical line in the sand around al-Brega , declaring dramatically , `` We will kill , we will die for oil . \nYou come to get our oil , we will destroy you . '' \nLibya 's Zlitan in rebel , NATO sights The rebels admit hundreds of their fighters were killed and wounded during a week of fighting around al-Brega , which Ibrahim grandiloquently re-branded `` Libya 's Stalingrad . '' \nMeanwhile , the Tripoli regime has been staging large rallies in support of its embattled leader . \nEnthusiastic , flag-waving crowds thronged the central squares of different regime-controlled towns and cities . \nPartisans swore allegiance to Gadhafi and defiantly fired volleys of gunfire in the air . \nState TV provided blanket coverage of the events , labeling them `` million man marches . '' \nThe size of the rallies has been the subject of heated debate between foreign journalists and government officials . \nBut there is no question that Tripoli has been shoring up popular support for the man who has ruled this country for more than 40 years . \nGovernment officials argue that the rallies prove Gadhafi is the democratic choice of the Libyan people , a position that the rebels have fought and bled to refute . \nTherein lies the main sticking point . \nThe regime insists cease-fire first , then talks , while also adding that Gadhafi 's position as `` Brother Leader '' is non-negotiable . \nBenghazi and NATO say no talks until Gadhafi goes . \nIn recent days , both the rebels and officials in Paris , London and Washington softened their demands . \nThey indicated one possible way out of the stalemate could include Gadhafi remaining in Libya , rather than going into exile . \nBut Wednesday 's announcement by Britain 's top diplomat marked yet another escalation against Gadhafi and his cohorts . \nWilliam Hague announced he would hand over Tripoli 's embassy -- as well as some of its frozen funds -- to the rebels in Benghazi . \nGadhafi has never been this internationally isolated , even in the dark days of the eighties when Ronald Reagan famously labeled him `` mad dog of the middle east . '' \nTurkey and even Germany , which abstained from the U.N. resolution authorizing the NATO operation in Libya , have both pledged to hand over hundreds of millions of dollars worth of regime assets to the rebels . \nEven tiny Malta , long described as the `` gateway to Libya , '' has all but broken with the Tripoli regime . \nThis week , the United Nations special envoy to Libya seemed to kill all hope for peace . \nAfter yet another round of shuttle diplomacy between the rebels and the regime , Abdul Ilah al-Khatib offered this grim assessment : `` Both sides remain far apart on reaching agreement on a political solution . '' \nA senior Muslim cleric told CNN that in the month to come , loyalist soldiers could break their daily Ramadan to better fight against what the regime calls `` the colonialist , crusader aggression . '' \nRamadan begins in just a few days . \nExpect Libya 's holy month to be a bloody one . \n"}

'' \nBut two days later , protests against Col. Moammar Gadhafi 's 41-year rule erupted in the eastern city of Benghazi . \nAs protests spread to other cities and towns across the country , the Gadhafi regime embarked on a bloody crackdown . \nToday , the country is split into territories controlled by loyalists and opposition rebels . \nA NATO military alliance is now into the fourth month of a campaign of airstrikes against government targets after the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution authorizing the use of force to protect civilian lives . \nThe civil war has all but shattered ambitious plans to upgrade transport , housing and infrastructure in a country that had long been isolated from the international community . \n`` The main objective was to create capacity for the economy to stand on its feet away from oil and gas production , '' recalled Zlitni somewhat wistfully , as he described a five-year , $ 170 billion plan to modernize Libya . \nIn March , the legions of foreign workers who had been contracted to build railroads , airports , apartment buildings and telecommunications networks began fleeing the rapidly escalating conflict by the tens of thousands . \nThe exodus included large numbers of engineers , construction and oil workers from China , Turkey , Egypt , and the Philippines , who crossed the western border with Tunisia on foot . \nAt the time , many of them told CNN stories of being robbed at gunpoint by Libyan security forces who took their cell phones , laptops and money . \n"}
{"id": "35", "time": "2011-04-07", "text": "By Dugald McConnell and Brian Todd , CNN U.S. firms getting rich from Gadhafi ? \nDocuments show Moammar Gadhafi waged PR campaign to burnish his image The Monitor Group , a Boston-based consulting firm , was paid $ 3 million a year Monitor senior partner : `` We were not working for Gadhafi , we were working for Libya '' Other U.S.-based firms were hired by Gadhafi -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Just a few years before becoming embroiled in fighting a rebellion , Moammar Gadhafi was spending millions of dollars a year to wage a PR campaign to burnish his global image as a statesman and a reformer , confidential documents show . \nThe mercurial leader hired The Monitor Group , a Boston-based consulting firm , to execute a public relations strategy that included paying think-tank analysts and former government officials to take a free trip to Libya for lectures , discussions and even personal meetings with Gadhafi starting in 2006 . \nAccording to a 2007 memo from Monitor to Gadhafi 's intelligence chief , the campaign was to `` enhance international understanding and appreciation of Libya ... emphasize the emergence of the new Libya ... -LRB- and -RRB- introduce Muammar Qadhafi as a thinker and intellectual . '' \nThe price : $ 3 million a year , plus expenses , for work that included consulting , briefings , analyses , and a steady stream of high-profile visitors to Libya -- at least one a month . \nThe memos were posted online by the National Conference of the Libyan Opposition . \nEamonn Kelly , senior partner at Monitor Group , is heading an internal investigation at the company . \nHe said the visitors program was only a small part of a wider campaign to help build civil society there . \nThe vast majority of the work , he says , was bringing leadership training and expertise to the country , aimed at `` promoting reform , improving the economic prosperity of the country and the people , modernizing the government and helping to heal the very broken civic society . '' \nWorking in a war zone `` We were not working for Gadhafi , we were working for Libya , '' Kelly said . \nAfter one year 's work , a 2007 memo from Monitor touted the results , including a dozen high-profile visitors , ranging from interviewer David Frost to eminent professors such as Francis Fukuyama , fellow at Stanford University . \nMonitor also took credit for positive media coverage and also highlighted a half-dozen positive articles written by some of the participants they sponsored . \nFor example , Benjamin Barber wrote an op-ed for The Washington Post entitled , `` Gaddafi 's Libya : An Ally for America ? '' \nand Andrew Moravcsik wrote a piece for Newsweek called , `` A Rogue Reforms . '' \nAlthough the firm had vowed to `` provide operational support for publication of positive articles on Libya , '' there is no indication any of the pieces were written at Monitor 's behest . \nInstead , participants in the program who were reached by CNN say they believed they were being paid for the lectures they gave and the coaching they offered . \nThey said they agreed to go because they were curious about Libya at a time when the regime had taken several positive steps toward the West and appeared to be open to change . \nBarber points out that , starting in 2003 , Libya `` came out of the cold , thanks to Bush administration overtures : rejoined the West , made war on al Qaeda , started imprisoning al Qaeda warriors , paid -LRB- Lockerbie -RRB- reparations of $ 1.3 billion , and yielded their weapons of mass destruction . '' \nBarber , an academic whose books on political theory include the best-seller `` Jihad vs. McWorld , '' says he now wants to see Gadhafi driven out . \nBut at the time , Barber tells CNN , `` we thought -- and I think Monitor thought -- it was an opportunity to work at internal reform . '' \nAnother distinguished academic , Harvard 's Joseph Nye , said he accepted the paid trip because `` Gadhafi appeared to be changing his policy -- and introducing new ideas could further reform . '' \nAfter he met with Gadhafi , Nye wrote an op-ed for The New Republic that contained both praise and criticism of the dictator . \nSeveral other program participants , including Fukuyama and Harvard 's Michael Porter , did not reply to inquiries . \nSome of the visitors who met with Gadhafi later briefed American officials , according to Monitor 's memo , including `` senior officials in the White House '' and `` senior government officials '' at the State Department and the Department of Defense . \nThe Monitor Group claimed that after they sponsored two trips to the country by former Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard Perle , `` he briefed Vice President Dick Cheney on his visits to Libya . '' \nCheney did not reply to an inquiry , but Perle told CNN he did not `` brief '' Cheney on Libya and that it was mistaken to suggest he had done any lobbying for Libya . \nStill , the possibility that paid visitors later briefed government officials has Paul Blumenthal at The Sunlight Foundation , a watchdog group that has reported on the subject , saying the firm should have registered as lobbyists for a foreign country . \n`` They really wanted these intellectuals to be able to influence policy on Libya , '' says Blumenthal , to talk to `` people in the State Department and the Defense Department , and really convey the sense that Libya was this great new open place . '' \nThe Monitor Group has received an inquiry about their work from the Justice Department , according to Kelly . \nMonitor also offered , in a letter to Gadhafi 's intelligence chief , a 22-page proposal for a book about Gadhafi , to be produced for $ 2.9 million in fees and expenses . \nThe book would cover Gadhafi 's `` ideas on democracy , '' the outline said , `` so that the West gains a more accurate and balanced understanding of his actions and ideas . '' \nThe book project never reached fruition , and Monitor said in a statement the proposal was `` a poor decision '' that the firm seriously regrets . \nBut overall , said Kelly , Monitor stands by its main body of work . \n`` We were working in a very different period , a period of promise , and we are heartbroken that that period clearly has ended . '' \nMonitor was n't the only U.S. firm that Gadhafi 's regime engaged . \nIn 2008 , as Monitor 's work was coming to a close , Libya retained a more traditional lobbying firm , The Livingston Group , led by former U.S. Rep. Bob Livingston , R-Louisiana . \nThe firm lobbied State Department officials and members of Congress for Libya in 2008 and 2009 , introducing Libya 's U.S. ambassador to dozens of members of Congress . \nLibya initially paid the firm $ 200,000 a month , but after a year , the billings had dwindled to just $ 30,000 a month . \nLivingston declined an interview with CNN , but he told CNN affiliate WVUE that he ended the contract shortly after Gadhafi gave a hero 's welcome to Lockerbie conspirator Abdelbeset al Megrahi upon his release from prison in Scotland . \n`` That was just a bridge too far , and we had to fire the client , '' he said . \nAnd before Livingston and Monitor , starting in 2004 , Gadhafi 's government engaged lobbyist Randa Fahmy Hudome during its effort to get Libya accepted in the international community and taken off the State Department 's list of nations who sponsor terrorism . \nLibya paid her firm more than $ 3 million over the course of three years , she said . \n`` It certainly was not about money , '' Hudome said . \n`` It was about national security principles at the time .

'' \n`` What remains clear is that NATO will continue to uphold the U.N. mandate and strike forces that can potentially cause harm to the civilian population of Libya , '' NATO said . \nGen. Abdul Fattah Yunis , commander of rebel forces , told reporters of the `` unfortunate setback . '' \nWorking in a war zone The planes fired on 20 rebel tanks near al-Brega Thursday morning , Yunis said . \nGadhafi 's troops moved forward after the attack , causing the opposition to pull back . \nSeveral of the tanks were destroyed . \nThe general said he wanted some answers from NATO on whether it or Gadhafi planes made the strike . \nIf the latter , Yunis said , NATO should have prevented that by enforcing the no-fly zone . \nHe added that the rebels had notified NATO of the tank movement and of their presence . \n`` There is no tension between us and NATO ; this is a war situation and we understand that mistakes are made , '' Yunis said . \nTwo soldiers and two medics died in the airstrike . \nFourteen people were injured and six are missing , Yunis said . \nWitnesses said the rebel fighters saw an airplane and thought it was from NATO , CNN 's Ben Wedeman reported . \nLater , the plane returned and fired several missiles and then made another strike . \nAmbulances responded , and the injured people were taken to a hospital in Ajdabiya . \nA few hours after the strikes , civilians and rebels , fearing an approach by pro-Gadhafi forces , retreated from Ajdabiya , with hundreds of civilian cars and trucks loaded with rocket launchers and ammunition headed out of town in the direction of the opposition headquarters in Benghazi . \nTanks were reportedly part of the column of vehicles . \nThe Gadhafi regime 's persistence in the face of NATO forces has frustrated and angered opposition leaders , who say they are not getting traction despite the alliance 's no-fly zone and air cover . \nNATO said weather conditions and tactics by the Gadhafi regime , such as using human shields and hiding equipment in populated areas , have hindered its efforts . \nIf the latest bombing run were a NATO strike , rebels said it would have been the second in a week 's time . \nLast week , airstrikes hit rebel vehicles and killed at least 13 rebel fighters in the al-Brega area , a spokesman for the Libyan opposition said . \nThe strikes come amid a deadly stalemate between pro-Moammar Gadhafi forces and rebel fighters , diplomatic maneuvering to end the conflict and blunt doubts about the potency of the opposition forces . \nAsked whether rebel fighters can push into Tripoli and oust Gadhafi , Gen. Carter Ham , U.S. Africa Command 's chief , told senators at a hearing Thursday , `` I would assess that as a low likelihood . '' \nAlso Thursday , a senior Libyan government official said four detained journalists are in government hands and are safe . \nThey will be brought to Tripoli and released , but the timing is uncertain , the official said . \nGlobalPost , an international news website , said pro-Gadhafi forces detained one of its freelancers and three other journalists . \nThey had been taken Tuesday night on the outskirts of al-Brega , said Peter Bouckaert , director of emergencies for Human Rights Watch . \nOn the diplomatic front , a former U.S. lawmaker who has been trying to meet with Gadhafi told CNN `` The Situation Room '' that Friday will be his last opportunity . \nCurt Weldon has said he will tell the leader to step aside and take other measures to end the bloodshed . \nA former Republican U.S. House member from suburban Philadelphia , Weldon has been to Libya before in his work as a congressman . \nHe said he came to the country this time with `` a small private delegation . '' \nWeldon said he has met with other Libyan officials , including the prime minster and Gadhafi 's son , Saadi , conveying the Obama administration 's stance on the crisis and reinforcing the importance of an immediate cease-fire monitored by the United Nations to protect civilians . \n`` I 'm here only because I want to avoid war , '' Weldon told CNN 's Wolf Blitzer . \n`` I do n't want to see American soldiers killed , and I do n't want to see more innocent Libyans killed , '' he added . \nFighting has raged across the country . \nRebel fighters and pro-Gadhafi forces have been pushing back and forth between al-Brega and Ajdabiya . \nIn the capital , Tripoli , four explosions were heard , and two aircraft could be seen overhead Thursday . \nLibyan government spokesman Musa Ibrahim described the Thursday airstrikes as heavy and `` really intensive . '' \nHe said the strikes hit `` military academies around Tripoli where students and teachers work . '' \nA British airstrike hit an oil field in the eastern town of Sarir on Wednesday , causing damage to a main pipeline , Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim told reporters . \nBut NATO 's operation in Libya denied responsibility , saying such blame reflects the desperation of the Gadhafi regime . \n`` We are aware that pro-Gadhafi forces have attacked this area in recent days , which resulted in at least one fire at an oil facility north of Sarir , '' said Lt. Gen. Charles Bouchard , commander of NATO 's Operation Unified Protector . \n`` We have never conducted strike operations in this area because his forces were not threatening civilian population centers from there , '' Bouchard said . \n`` The only one responsible for this fire is the Gadhafi regime , and we know he wants to disrupt oil getting to Tobruk . '' \nMeanwhile , violence continues in the western city of Misrata . \nHam said the `` regime has a significantly degraded ability to continue to attack civilians '' and Misrata is a `` notable exception . '' \n`` The opposition forces have held an area in the northeastern portion of the city , in the port . \nAnd frankly , the port has been operating to get some relief , '' he said . \n`` But the regime forces are and remain active in the city against civilians . '' \nU.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has said conditions in Misrata are `` especially grave , '' citing `` reports of the use of heavy weapons to attack the city , where the population is trapped and unable , as a result of heavy shelling that has continued over several weeks , to receive basic supplies , including clean water , food and medicines . '' \nThe World Food Programme said one of its humanitarian vessels loaded with food , medical supplies and doctors has reached the port of Misrata , providing what it called a `` lifeline '' for trapped civilians . \n`` This is a breakthrough for the U.N. humanitarian operation in Libya and allows us to reach tens of thousands of people who are caught in one of the fiercest areas of conflict , '' said WFP Executive Director Josette Sheeran . \n`` It is vital that we get these relief supplies to the vulnerable .

{"id": "43", "time": "2011-04-07", "text": "Testifying before Congress on Thursday , General Carter Ham , the head of U.S. Africa Command affirmed that the situation in Libya is grinding toward a stalemate . \nThe Libyan rebels are not an organized fighting force , but Moammar Gadhafi can not mobilize a major offensive against them because of NATO airstrikes and dwindling support within his own army . \nSo what lies ahead ? \nMilitary analysts and Libya experts articulate three main possibilities : -LRB- 1 -RRB- a prolonged stalemate , -LRB- 2 -RRB- a negotiated settlement , or -LRB- 3 -RRB- total victory for one side . \nProlonged stalemate : The situation could remain much as it is now with the opposition controlling Benghazi , Ajdabiya and some of the coastline . \nMoammar Gadhafi would control the rest . \nZachary Hosford and Andrew Exum at the Center for a New American Security recently described what this might look like : A stalemate in Libya would effectively result in a de facto partition of the country with a severely under-governed and disorganized safe haven in eastern Libya for the rebels that could provide refuge for various militant and criminal groups capable of exporting violence and instability to other countries in North Africa and the Middle East . \nMax Boot , a national security fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations -LRB- CFR -RRB- , describes the worst case scenario in which this stalemate drags go on for years much as Saddam Hussein clung to power for a decade after the First Gulf War . \nMiddle East scholar Juan Cole illustrates a more hopeful scenario in which - after weeks , months or perhaps a year - a negotiated settlement is reached . \nHe noted that the 1995 Dayton Accords were signed more than a year after NATO started bombing in Bosnia . \nNegotiated settlement : Many analysts argue that time is not on Gadhafi s side . \nNATO strikes wear down his forces while other nations supply the rebels with weapons and training . \nThe rebels are gaining access to oil money and potentially to Gadhafi s frozen accounts , while sanctions squeeze Gadhafi and his associates . \nUnable to pay his mercenaries and losing control , Gadhafi might ultimately feel forced to negotiate , or former loyalists may oust him and negotiate in his stead . \nIn either event , the outcome of a negotiation is an open question . \nThey could lead to the establishment of an interim council , paving the way for parliamentary elections , or , if the stalemate lasts for many years , potentially the partition of Libya . \nTotal victory for one side or the other : Gadhafi s regime could collapse . \nThis is the scenario many are hoping for . \nThis could occur if Gadhafi s army breaks in the face of continued NATO bombing or if Gadhafi s deputies defect en masse . \nTripoli would then be open to the rebels . \nHaving the rebels forcibly overthrow Gadhafi would be much more difficult . \nAs Libyan journalist Fadel Al-Ameen explains , I don t imagine that the rebels in the East will be capable of driving all the way to Tripoli . \nEven if they do , just to invade Tripoli would be a humanitarian catastrophe because Gadhafi and his forces would wreak havoc on the civilian population there . \nThe opposite possibility is that Gadhafi defeats the rebels and reasserts control over all of Libya . \nThis is the nightmare scenario , but it is also extremely unlikely . \nThe world s attention would have to shift away from Libya entirely to allow Gadhafi to amass the requisite force . \nMost analysts agree that sooner or later - whether weeks , months or years -- Gadhafi has to go , leaving open the question of what happens next . \nAs James Lindsay of CFR notes , Part of the problem is we re talking about what happens on day one . \nThe crucial question is what will be happening in the fall and next year . \nThe same is true if the rebels take it all . \nThat is only the first chapter of the book . \nExum worries because most post-conflict states go through a stage where external aid exceeds the government 's capacity to effectively administer it , creating conditions ripe for corruption . \nIn Libya 's case , you will have a similar situation with both -LRB- a -RRB- a lot of government oil revenues and -LRB- b -RRB- very little bureaucracy capable of redistributing resources within the society . \nBut there is also reason for optimism . \nAs Al-Ameen says , Libya s level of education is high . \nWe re not looking at a country like Afghanistan , which is a tribal society without leadership or government . \nNor is Libya like Iraq with so many sectarian differences . \nLibya also has economic resources that will help it survive and prosper . \nThe future doesn t look too bad . '' \nThere 's only one good scenario for the future of Libya and that 's the total victory of the forces loyal to Mohammar Qaddafy . \nThe fall of Qaddafy would spell the end of Libya 's independence and pave the way for the West to get their grimy hands on Libya 's oil which would be tragic at best . \nApril 7 , 2011 at 6:15 pm | Reply Very well said , Onesmallvoice . \nLike you said , the only good scenario is the total victory for the Qaddafy forces . \nApril 7 , 2011 at 7:25 pm | Reply What is the USA and UN doing in Libya anyway ? \nRecolonizing few centuries late ? \nAmerica is acting like Napoleon 's France , the End of Rome and the end of colonial Europe : losing power and becoming reckless . \nApril 10 , 2011 at 2:55 am | This whole endeavor is a shameful attempt at regime change which looks like it has backfired and now is a MESS . \nObama saw this as a dirty political failure and has symbolically backed away ...

April 7 , 2011 at 10:15 pm | Reply Very superficial analysis . \nI challenge you go to Libya and live in Libya for one month under Ghaddafi 's system . \nIt is a psychological suffocation that even the western journalists felt despite living in 5 starr hotels . \nThis is about a mafia deciding the fait of 6 million people . \nI saw my generation transforming from a peaceful society to drug addicts , extremists , corrupt people and psychological abuse Ghaddafi 's regime . \nI wish that you have some sensitivity towards sufferings of your fellow human beings in Libya . \nApril 8 , 2011 at 9:24 am | Obama wanted to appear tough on the world stage and a `` freedom fighter '' for the `` oppressed '' . \nHe did n't do his homework and got caught not knowing who he was `` helping '' . \nThe scary thing is Obama , the Pentagon , CIA and NSA , STILL after weeks of fighting and months of advance warning that something might happen in Libya , STILL have no idea who the rebels are and what they plan on doing if they get Qadaffi out and win . \nThis is the supposed Commander-In-Chief of the worlds top fighting force . \nObama should be impeached for this attack on Libya . \nThis is what happens when Sheeple get drawn in by the Orator-In-Chief . \nGreat talker , no idea what he is doing . \nHe is just a talking head puppet . \nImpeach and remove him now and set a new emergency election for President . \nApril 8 , 2011 at 11:48 am | Fred i guess you have more information than the US government ? \nIf you know so much about what is going on in the world then why are n't you the one making the decisions ? \nApril 8 , 2011 at 4:20 pm | The Libyan born in Canada is one who know as much about Libya as AC360 . \nEmotional crap meant for ratings . \nFolks , this is real life . \nLibyan problems are best solved by Libyans . \nTea party protested Pres.

\nAnd if he does will the international community respond in a similar way ? \nThere should be no surprise that the opposition forces will not agree to anything that includes a Gaddafi in power . \nAs Fareed pointed out earlier , if anything is going to break Gaddafi , it is going to be economic pressure and defections of his inner circle . \nIn this sense , the best outcome is somewhere between 2 and 3 . \nTo accomplish this , NATO should continue with its operations , continue to train\\/arm the rebels , and also provide them with humanitarian aid if needed . \nMeanwhile , the African Union should work to convince Gaddafi to gracefully step down from power so as not to anger the supporters in Tripoli . \nThis brings up another important question : how will Gaddafi s most ardent supporters in Tripoli view the rebels if\\/when they try to form a new government in the name of Libya ?

'' \nShe said the men who tortured her are still free , without punishment . \nLater Saadi Gadhafi told me : `` The people responsible for raping her should face charges . \nShe is a strong woman . '' \nAl-Obeidy , a law school graduate , spoke her mind in Gadhafi 's presence and gave no indication that she was intimidated by him , even when she accused the Libyan authorities of lawlessness , brutality and lies . \n`` I wanted to defend myself because they did not even give me the right to respond , '' she said . \nI wanted to defend myself because they did not even give me the right to respond . \nThat Saturday , when she tried to speak to journalists at the Rixos Hotel , she was dragged off the property . \nShe was beaten and thrown in jail . \nHer phone was confiscated . \nAt one point , al-Obeidy told her fellow citizens in eastern Libya and the besieged western city of Misrata to be strong . \nAfter the interview was over , Gadhafi objected to that line . \nAl-Obeidy agreed to Gadhafi 's request that it be cut from the video , but only with full disclosure that those 10 seconds had been removed . \nIbrahim , the government spokesman , reviewed my interview and objected to its tone , to the questions I asked and to the overall content . \nBut Saadi Gadhafi overruled his objections . \nWe were asked not to broadcast the interview until another government representative was able to look at it . \nAt the insistence of the Libyan government , we delayed transmission of the video for 18 hours , waiting for word . \nBut the review never came and in the end we were cleared to air almost all of al-Obeidy 's words with the exception of the 10 seconds that she agreed to cut . \nShe was thankful for Saadi Gadhafi 's efforts to make the interview happen . \n`` He was a humble and understanding man , and he treated me well , '' she told me . \n`` He said that he will take my case and help me .

'' \nAfter the uprising began February 15 , Abdul-Jalil was among the government officials who broke with the regime . \nHe has gone on to lead the opposition 's National Transitional Council , a 31-member group representing most regions in Libya . \nThe group has met in Benghazi , an eastern town that has become an opposition stronghold . \nLibyan leader Moammar Gadhafi told a Turkish reporter in an interview Tuesday that the imposition of a no-fly zone would simply unite the Libyan people behind him . \n`` They will be united against the new attempt for occupation and imperialistic interests and it will be clear that they are conspiring against Libya , '' he said . \n`` It will also be clear that the intentions are to control Libya 's oil , choke Libya 's liberty , land and people . '' \nSecret voices speak out in Libya Massive explosions rock Libyan oil town The risks of a Libya no-fly zone Abdul-Jalil 's remarks came shortly after Gadhafi 's regime announced a reward for Abdul-Jalil 's capture , branding him `` an agent spy . '' \nIn an `` urgent '' banner on state television , the government said its General Administration for Criminal Investigation was offering 500,000 Libyan dinars -LRB- $ 410,900 U.S. -RRB- `` for whoever captures and hands over '' the `` agent spy '' Abdul-Jalil , and `` another offer of 200,000 Libyan dinars -LRB- $ 164,300 U.S. -RRB- for whoever offers information leading to his actual arrest . '' \nIn a letter to the U.N. General Assembly , the transitional council asked that it be recognized as `` the sole representative of all Libya . '' \nIt also asked the international community to `` fulfill its obligations to protect the Libyan people from any further genocide and crimes against humanity without any direct military intervention on Libyan soil . '' \nThe letter , which was dated March 5 , was made public Wednesday . \nThe move to target Abdul-Jalil came as Gadhafi fought to advance against rebels who have taken control of many parts of the country . \nOn Wednesday , pro-Gadhafi forces launched fresh attacks on Ras Lanuf , using planes and heavy artillery in an effort to retake the eastern oil city . \nOpposition fighters , armed with anti-aircraft guns and Soviet rifles , were outgunned by the heavily armed pro-Gadhafi forces . \nCNN 's Ben Wedeman reported that an intense artillery bombardment was under way on the western edge of Ras Lanuf , where ambulances lined up to the emergency ward at Ras Lanuf 's only hospital to drop off the wounded . \nMore than 25 people were wounded , said Dr. Ali Al-Bart , at Ras Lanuf Hospital . \n`` It 's very bad , the situation is very bad , '' he said . \nOpposition efforts remained , but appeared weak . \nAhmed Faturi left his clothing store in Benghazi to carry a SAM-7 surface-to-air missile , but knew he had little chance of hitting a plane with it . \nAnd he expressed little hope that a no-fly zone would ever materialize . \n`` Just talk , '' he said . \nA few days ago , the rebel forces were advancing steadily westward toward Gadhafi 's stronghold in the capital city of Tripoli . \nBut that advancement appears to have reversed . \nIn Ras Lanuf , an oil storage tank to the west was hit in the fighting , though it was not clear who was responsible . \nLibyan state television reported that `` armed groups supported by al Qaeda blew up an oil tank as they withdrew from Ras Lanuf against the advancing Libyan armed forces . '' \nThe attack marked the first time since the rebellion began more than three weeks ago that Libya 's oil infrastructure has been damaged . \nGadhafi has shown no sign of giving up . \nOn state television , he again insisted Tuesday night that youths misled and drugged by al Qaeda were to blame for the fighting . \n`` For them , everybody 's their enemy , '' Gadhafi said . \n`` They know nothing other than killing . '' \nInside the mind of a dictator The speech was recorded earlier Tuesday when Gadhafi addressed a youth group of tribal supporters , urging them to defend Libya from those who envy its standard of living . \n`` They want to take your petrol , '' he said . \n`` This is what America , this is what the French , those colonialists , want . '' \nA private Libyan aircraft crossed Greek airspace Wednesday en route to Cairo , Egypt , and the pilot said there were two passengers on board , according to Greek civil aviation authorities . \nThe pilot did not identify the passengers , aviation authorities said . \nMultiple media reports said the plane landed in Cairo . \nThe development raised questions about whether Libyan officials may have flown to Cairo . \nOn Tuesday , an opposition member said Gadhafi was negotiating an exit deal , but other opposition members and the government denied that . \nIn the fourth week of what has become a civil war , Gadhafi 's regime has held on to the capital , while losing control to the opposition in some other areas . \nBenghazi , in eastern Libya , is an opposition stronghold . \nPeople in some towns in the western part of the country told CNN Wednesday their areas were under rebel control . \nIn Zuwarah , two sources said the city , which is located between Zawiya and the country 's western border , with Tunisia , was surrounded by Gadhafi supporters but most shops and banks were operating normally . \nA witness described the scene as tense , with schools , government offices and businesses closed . \nDemonstrations were no longer being held because , the witness said , `` There is no one to protest against . '' \nTwo Zuwarah residents said `` messengers from Gadhafi '' had warned local leaders Wednesday to surrender or face attack . \nThe `` messengers '' told the leaders that replacing the pre-Gadhafi regime flag in the city with the government 's green flag would be interpreted as a sign of solidarity with the regime , the sources said . \nThey added that there had been implicit threats against Zuwarah to bomb two nearby facilities : a petro-chemical plant 15 kilometers away and a gas export facility 30 kilometers away . \nIn Zawiya , two sources said the fighting continued in the city center Wednesday , but to a lesser extent than on Tuesday . \nThey said the opposition occupied the city center , which was surrounded by the military . \nOn the outskirts of the city , pro-Gadhafi rallies were being held , they said . \nBut Libyan television reported that Gadhafi supporters were celebrating `` the liberation of the town from the armed terrorist elements backed by al Qaeda '' in the main square . \nAccess to the city was limited . \nA witness told CNN she tried to travel from Tripoli to Zawiya but was turned away at various checkpoints . \nCommunications were so difficult that CNN was not able to talk with anyone in the city . \nOne Zawiya resident , who told CNN she had to make the 40-minute trip to Tripoli to make a phone call , said there had been no electricity in Zawiya for the previous day . \nIn addition , two medical clinics that were shut Tuesday by the military remained closed Wednesday , she said . \nAnother source who fled Zawiya Tuesday for the Tunisian border said many bodies in the city lay unclaimed because relatives -- fearing violence -- would not go to graveyards to bury them . \nResidents of Zuwarah sent weapons , explosives , and medical supplies via a small boat to Zawiya , the witness said . \nThe man who drove the boat dropped the supplies immediately upon arrival and fled out of fear . \nLibyan state TV showed video of government supporters cheering in Zawiya 's streets and hoisting the government flag on Wednesday . \nWitnesses said fear remained widespread in the capital , where schools were closed . \nA resident said she called several banks to ask about taking out money but was told that there was a shortage of cash . \nNalut was under opposition control and calm Wednesday , a witness said . \nIn Ajdabiya and Misrata , spokesmen for opposition groups said those towns remained under opposition control and were calm as well . \nTwo doctors in Misrata said medical supplies were in short supply . \nMore than 80 people remained at Central Misrata Hospital recovering from wounds suffered Sunday in fighting , they said . \nLibya 's government sought Wednesday to influence international sentiment , announcing that Libya 's secretary of state for international relations will travel to Portugal , Greece and Malta on an exploratory fact-finding mission that may include other destinations . \nLibya has invited British , French , Dutch and German fact-finding teams to Libya to examine reports of aerial bombardment and massacres . \nLibya had received no response from any of the invitees . \nThe decision about whether to impose a no-fly zone is a complicated one , said Nicholas Burns , a former U.S. ambassador to NATO . \n`` There 's no assurance that the imposition of even a no-fly zone would make a decisive difference in the battle , '' Burns said . \n`` Gadhafi has ground forces . \nHe has artillery , he has a mercenary army . \nThat 's 95 percent of the fighting under way in Libya . '' \nAnd it would not prove to be a panacea , the head of the U.S. Marine Corps told lawmakers Tuesday . \nMarine Corps Commandant Gen. James F. Amos said that a no-fly zone would do little to thwart Libya 's helicopters , which he called `` their greatest threat . '' \nA no-fly zone would typically be enforced by fighter jets whose speed and altitude make it difficult to target helicopters , which move low and slow , Amos said . \nFor its part , Libya said it was not misusing its air force . \nAny no-fly zone would be tantamount to an act of war , Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khalid Karim said Tuesday . \nThe military , he said , `` are taking purely defensive positions ; they are not taking offensive ones . '' \nHe said the Libyan government has asked for international monitors to verify that assertion . \nThe protests against the 68-year-old Gadhafi began February 15 as anti-government demonstrators sought his ouster after nearly 42 years of rule . \nDeath toll estimates have ranged from more than 1,000 to as many as 2,000 . \nAnd the war has forced out 215,000 people , many of them poor migrant workers who have been stranded at both the Tunisian and Egyptian borders , the U.N. refugee agency has said . \nWhile many countries chartered planes and dispatched ships to whisk away their citizens to safety , those stuck at the border are sheltered in cramped , unsanitary quarters with little to eat . \nThe United Nations ' special representative for children and armed conflict , Radhika Coomaraswamy , said her office had received unconfirmed reports of violence against children , `` including killing and maiming and use of children as combatants and the denial of humanitarian access . '' \nValerie Amos , the United Nations under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator , called for all Libyan civilians to be protected . \n`` I am deeply concerned about the reportedly indiscriminate nature of the fighting , and particularly the use of heavy artillery and aerial bombardments , '' she said in a statement . \n`` We are also hearing reports of hospital closures at the very time when people most need medical care .

World Food Programme has initiated a $ 39.2 million emergency operation intended to provide food to more than 1 million people in Libya , Egypt and Tunisia over a three-month period . \nIn the latest sign of international solidarity with the Libyan opposition , a group of people entered a home in London Wednesday owned by Saif Gadhafi , the Libyan leader 's son who has spoken on behalf of the regime in recent weeks . \nThey could be seen hanging a banner out an upstairs window with a picture of Gadhafi in a red circle with a line through it . \n`` Out of Libya , '' the sign says , `` Out of London .

Security Council over the weekend voted for tough restrictions and possible war crimes charges against the Libyan regime . \nOn Monday , Chavez said Gadhafi , `` has been my friend and our friend for a long time , '' in remarks broadcast on Venezuelan state television . \nAnd in comments made on Thursday , Chavez described alleged preparations to invade Libya as `` a madness , and in front of that madness , as always , the Yankee empire that tries to dominate the world , at the cost of fire and blood . '' \nThe former Cuban President Fidel Castro on Thursday also condemned what he described as the inevitable U.S.-backed invasion of Libya by NATO to get its hands on that country 's oil . \nSeener said that countries with a record of `` domestic abuse , '' such as limiting freedom of speech and having no independent judiciary , have no sense of accountability to their people in the same way that elected powers do and that lack of perceived accountability tends to spill over into their foreign polices . \nAnother close allay of Gadhafi is Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe . \nLibya has good relations with Zimbabwe , which has few international friends , says Jane Kinninmont , senior research fellow at the think tank Chatham House . \n`` She notes the contrast with Sudan , which was able to count on a far broader range of allies , including China and most of the Arab world , when it faced condemnation from the West over the ethnic conflict in Darfur '' . \nShe adds that , for example , during the bloody ethnic conflict in the Sudanese region of Darfur , Sudan faced international condemnation but `` did still have its friends in the international world . '' \nThere is also a second group of nations -- including China , Russia and Turkey -- which while unlikely to openly back Gadhafi , would not support an invasion and they would also be against a no-fly zone , said Seener . \n`` It is not simply a case of being anti-Western . \nTurkey for example is increasing diplomatic and economic links with Iran and as it does so it is entering the Iranian sphere of influence . \nThey will not condemn what Gadhafi is doing in Libya , '' says Seener . \nDespite the continued backing of Gadhafi by his allies , some analysts predict a sorry end for the leader . \nScott Horton , an international lawyer said : `` Deposed dictators now are subject to lawsuits , both civil suits by the governments that succeeded them and human rights suits , and they wind up being prosecuted and successfully sued . '' \nHowever , Barak Barfi of the New America Foundation said : `` I think there is a very good possibility he 'll fight to the death knowing he has very few options . '' \n"}

'' \nFrom the New York Times : The specter of a violent tribal conflict within the rebel ranks touches on a central fear of the Western nations backing the Libyan insurrection : that the rebels democratic goals could give way to a tribal civil war over Libya s oil resources . \nColonel Qaddafi has often warned of such a possibility as he has fought to keep power , while the rebel leaders have argued that their cause transcends Libya s age-old tribal divisions . \nA pickup truck full of angry armed Obeidi tribesmen arrived at the front of the hotel -LRB- in Benghazi that acts as rebel hq . -RRB- . \nSome fired their Kalashnikovs at hotel windows , shattering them , and others shot into the air . \nOne man raced with his rifle through the front door of the hotel , and two witnesses said they heard gunshots inside . \nRebels in west seize four towns In the western Nafusa mountain range southwest of the capital , Tripoli , hundreds of rebels launched a broad offensive against government forces Thursday , seizing three small towns and advancing on others to secure a major supply route near the Tunisian border , rebel spokesmen said . \nFour rebel fighters were killed and several wounded while taking the small towns of Jawsh , Ghezaya and Takut , Abdel-Salam Othman said . \nThe claimed successes come after one of the biggest rebel offensives in recent weeks and , if true , puts the fighters closer to capturing a significant supply route used by Gadhafi forces . \nIbrahim said that on the eastern side of the mountains , Gadhafi forces had been shelling rebel-held positions near Beir al-Ghanam and also near Qawalish . \nThe authorities in Syria have said saboteurs blew up an oil pipeline near Homs , a hub of protest against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad . \nThe attack was the second of its kind this month . \nIt left a crater 15m -LRB- 50ft -RRB- wide and oil gushing from the broken pipe , the state news agency Sana said . \nOvernight , at least five people were killed during raids by security forces , activists say . \nThe deaths occurred in the north-eastern city of Deir al-Zour and a suburb of the capital Damascus , in the south-west of the country . \nActivists and opposition groups are calling on the `` silent majority '' to stand up and be counted in the last Friday mass rallies across Syria before Ramadan . \nOpposition groups have given Friday rallies the label `` Your silence is killing us '' in attempts to mobilize prominent community leaders , intellectuals , the business elite , religious leaders and other Arab countries to join the opposition cause . \nWhile mass protests have been marked in regional centers around the country , Syria s two largest capital cities , Damascus and Aleppo , have so far failed to attract the large numbers of protesters like the regional centers of Hama , Homs and elsewhere . \nMany believe the protest movement must take hold of the business and political capitals to progress from the deadly ritual stalemate that has claimed the lives of up to 1,500 civilians . \nWill Ramadan provide new platform for Syrian protests ? \nThe relentless cycle of protest and crackdown in Syria over the last four months appears poised to enter a new phase in the coming Muslim holy month of Ramadan , with activists planning to capitalize on religious rhythms to hold nightly demonstrations despite fears of an even harsher government reaction . \nThe protesters say it should be easier to gather people since they would ordinarily end their days of fasting and nights of feasting with a visit to mosques for prayers . \nTheir hope is that mobilizing people every day , rather than waiting for large Friday protests , will wear down a government that has so far been able to hang on to support among substantial sectors of the population despite protests that have grown larger and more widespread . \nActivists , who have posted video on YouTube instructing protesters on the plan , said they expect demonstrations to begin around 10:30 p.m. , just after people gather for the tarawih , the prayer performed only in Ramadan . \nMore civilians killed in southern Afghanistan Two roadside bombs killed 19 people and wounded four Friday in Afghanistan as civilians are increasingly being caught in crossfire of the fighting between the Taliban and the U.S.-led coalition . \nA minibus ran over a bomb in Nahri Sarraj district of Helmand province , with the blast killing all 18 passengers , said Kamaluddin Sherzai , the province s deputy police chief . \n`` The mine was very powerful and destroyed the vehicle , '' he said . \n`` They were all civilians . \nSome were children . '' \nIn its midyear report , the United Nations said the number of Afghan civilians killed in war-related violence rose by 15 percent in the first half of 2011 . \nThe report said 1,462 Afghan civilians lost their lives , including 444 killed by roadside bombs . \nDuring the first half of last year , 1,271 Afghan civilians were killed in the war . \nTalks on long-term Afghan -- US partnership stumble Negotiations to set the terms of the U.S. partnership with Afghanistan in the decade after 2014 are faltering as the two countries struggle to bridge the gap between their demands , according to U.S. and Afghan officials . \nAfter months of talks , some of the officials involved are growing increasingly pessimistic about the prospect of a substantive `` strategic partnership '' declaration anytime soon that would allow for a long-term U.S. troop presence in exchange for protection guarantees for Afghanistan and support for the nation s security forces . \nU.S. - led NATO forces are set to leave Afghanistan by the end of 2014 . \n`` I see a situation building that will turn negative , '' said Shaida Mohammad Abdali , Afghanistan s deputy national security adviser . \n`` If the U.S. is really interested in staying in Afghanistan , it must show it practically to the Afghan government and the people . \nAnd respond to what we need . '' \nUN stiffens sanctions against Pakistan Taliban The U.N. Security Council on Friday will impose sanctions on the Pakistani Taliban , an extremist Islamic organization which American officials blame for masterminding the botched September 2010 Times Square bombing plot . \nThe group , which is formally named Tehrik-E-Taliban Pakistan -LRB- TTP -RRB- , will be added Friday to a U.N. blacklist of terrorist organizations linked to Al Qaeda . \nIt was already placed on the U.S. Foreign Terrorist Organization list last September , some four months after the U.S. accused the group of attempting to set off a car bomb in the packed New York City tourism center . \nThe United States proposed in recent weeks that the organization be added to the U.N. list , citing the widening reach of the organization 's terror targets . \nAustralia , Canada , Britain , France and Pakistan cosponsored the U.S. measure . \nYemen : tribal clashes kill 40 Associated Press : Clashes between Yemeni soldiers and armed tribesmen in a mountainous region north of the capital killed at least 40 people yesterday , a military official said . \nThe fighting in the Arhab region is one example of the wider security collapse across Yemen since the outbreak of a massive uprising seeking to topple President Ali Abdullah Saleh six months ago . \nArmed tribesmen are battling security forces in Arhab , the southern city of Taiz , and elsewhere , while militants believed to be linked to Al Qaeda have overrun towns in the country s restive south . \nYesterday s clashes northeast of Sana s international airport began when tribesmen attacked a base belonging to the Republican Guard , said Sheik Hamid Assem of the Arhab tribe . \nShabab send more fighters to Mogadishu Heavy fighting broke out Thursday in the Somali capital , Mogadishu , as African Union peacekeepers launched an offensive to protect famine relief efforts from attacks by the Shabab rebels , officials said . \nAt least six people died . \nThe Shabab , which initially said they would allow the aid to be delivered , changed their mind last week . \nThe rebels have sent 300 reinforcement fighters to Mogadishu in recent days , said Lt. Col. Paddy Ankunda , spokesman for the African Union peacekeeping force . \nHe said the Shabab were trying to prevent aid from reaching the tens of thousands of famine refugees who have poured into Mogadishu this month . \nCNN 's Nima Elbagir reports from Mogadishu : `` Tens of thousands of people fled the Somali capital of Mogadishu because of the violence and insecurity here . \nThey 're now having to come back seeking refuge from the famine that hit them in those areas they fled to , and it seems that that violence is following them , '' Elbagir says . \nSenior al Qaeda figure in Algeria killed Algerian security forces killed a top member of an Al-Qaeda regional offshoot and two accomplices who were trying to reach Algiers aboard a car laden with explosives , a government official said Thursday . \nThe official said Abdelkahar Belhadj , son of former Islamic leader Ali Belhadj , was killed Monday as he was heading for the capital Algiers with a small group of Islamic extremists and that they were plotting a bomb attack . \nBelhadj , born in 1988 , joined Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb -LRB- AQIM -RRB- in 2006 and took the battle name of `` Mouawia , '' in tribute to one of the companions of the Prophet Mohammad . \nBelhadj s father had been deputy leader of the Islamic Salvation Front -LRB- FIS -RRB- , whose armed wing tried to overthrow the government in a bloody civil war from 1992 to the early 2000s . \nIraq -- as US leaves , Iran steps in American influence within Iraq is on the wane . \nU.S. officials believe the Iranian government is trying to fill the void , stepping up both its commercial dealings with Iraq s government the two countries , along with Syria , signed a $ 10 billion natural-gas pipeline deal earlier this week and its covert support to the armed militias inflicting casualties on the departing U.S. troops . \n`` Their intent is to bleed U.S. forces on the way out of Iraq for some sort of moral victory , as well as to reestablish coercive control over Iraqi governors in the south by showing off their capacity to carry out these kinds of sophisticated attacks , '' said Mike Oates , a recently-retired , three-star Army general and former commander of all U.S. forces in southern Iraq . \n`` They re trying to prick us as we leave . '' \nU.S. military officials acknowledge that it will be difficult , if not impossible , to prevent Iranian-made weaponry from being smuggled into Iraq . \nUS says Iran supporting al Qaeda The United States has accused Iran of providing sanctuary to an al Qaeda network that provides help to jihadists moving between the Middle East , Afghanistan and Pakistan . \nThe U.S. Department of the Treasury Thursday announced the designation of six members of the network , including its alleged leader Ezedin Abdel Aziz Khalil , and described Iran as a `` critical transit point for funding to support al-Qaeda s activities in Afghanistan and Pakistan . '' \n`` This network serves as the core pipeline through which al-Qaeda moves money , facilitators and operatives from across the Middle East to South Asia , '' the U.S. Treasury said in a statement . \nNot so fast The recently departed director of the nation s main counterterrorism center said Thursday that Al Qaeda in Pakistan still posed a serious threat to the United States , and he warned that assessments that Al Qaeda was on the verge of collapse lacked `` accuracy and precision . '' \nThe comments by the official , Michael E. Leiter , who stepped down three weeks ago as head of the National Counterterrorism Center , are the most significant pushback to a growing chorus of statements by American officials that the death of Osama bin Laden and years of Central Intelligence Agency drone strikes in Pakistan have brought the United States `` within reach of strategically defeating Al Qaeda , '' as Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta put it recently . \nMr. Leiter said that Al Qaeda s leadership and structure in Pakistan were `` on the ropes , '' but he contended that `` the core organization is still there and could launch some attacks '' and that `` Pakistan remains a huge problem . '' \nHe noted that the failed plot to blow up an explosives-packed vehicle in Times Square in May 2010 was carried out by a Pakistani-American trained by the Pakistani Taliban . \nThe Qaeda affiliate in Yemen also remains especially dangerous , he added . \nMr. Leiter also raised concerns that a decade of intensive paramilitary operations by the Central Intelligence Agency in Afghanistan , Pakistan , Somalia and Yemen had begun to change the nature of the spy service , and not necessarily all for the better . \n`` The question has to be asked : Has that in some ways diminished some of its strategic , long-term intelligence collection and analysis mission ? '' \nhe said , citing the potential impact on traditional espionage and analysis of longer-range issues like China and counterproliferation . \nThe infamous Norwegian gunner planned to carry out more attacks on the same day , his lawyer has said Friday . \n`` Breivik planned to carry out a few more attacks on July 22 , on a slightly different scale . \nHowever , something happened , about which I can t yet speak , and his plans didn t come to anything , '' Geir Lippestad told Norway s Aftenposten newspaper . \nAnders Breivik is accused of killing over 70 people in Norway in two terror attacks last Friday . \nBreivik has confessed to both crimes . \nHe is due to be interrogated for the second time by police today . \nAhead of yesterday s emergency counterterrorism meeting , EU Home Affairs Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom spoke of a `` huge lack of political leadership in allowing right-wing sentiment to bleed into the mainstream . \n`` Blaming Islam or immigration for all sorts of problems has become normal , Malmstrom told the European Voice newspaper . \nShe cited a `` permissive climate in which such views `` are no longer seen as extreme . \nGerman Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich said Germany s intelligence agencies had far-right groups under `` intensive surveillance , but there was a greater risk in extremists like Breivik who operate alone and under the radar . \n`` Among the right extremists , we know of some who could be dangerous , but they re not the problem -- those who we have an eye on -- but rather those who radicalize in secret , he told the Rheinische Post . \nFort Hood case : Abdo had jihadist bomb recipe An AWOL Muslim American Army private arrested near Fort Hood has told investigators that he wanted to attack fellow soldiers at the military post , the police chief in Killeen , Texas , said Thursday . \n`` Military personnel were a target of this suspect , '' Chief Dennis Baldwin told reporters about Pfc. Naser Jason Abdo , who is expected to face federal charges . \nBaldwin said Abdo , who was arrested Wednesday , had no accomplices , `` as far as I know . '' \nHe added , `` We are not aware of any additional threats to the safety of our community .

Hasan , the Army psychiatrist who has been charged in the killing of 13 people at the base in 2009 , according to congressional and federal officials . \nPfc. Naser Abdo , 21 , was arrested in Killeen , Tex. , after authorities said they discovered bombmaking materials in his motel room , as well as a copy of an article from the al-Qaeda magazine Inspire , which is produced by the terrorist group s Yemen affiliate . \nThe officials said Abdo was planning to set off bombs at locations outside the base where soldiers gather and to follow the explosions with gunfire . \n`` I would classify this as a terror plot , '' Police Chief Dennis Baldwin told reporters in Killeen . \nLaw enforcement officials said Abdo would be charged in federal court with possession of bombmaking materials , among other offenses . \n\\* CNN 's Randi Kaye interviewed Greg Ebert , a former police officer working at the Killeen , Texas gun store where Pfc Naser Jason Abdo went to buy supplies . \nHere is some of what Ebert told CNN 's Newsroom : `` He came to the store to purchase a quantity of smokeless gunpowder and did not seem to know what it was . \nIt was just really odd , his behavior .

Abdul Fattah Younis came after the rebels ' Transitional National Council sought Younis for questioning about military matters and alleged ongoing ties to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi , according to what Younis ' supporters told journalist James Hider of the Times of London . \nSupporters also shot at a Benghazi hotel and smashed its windows . \nJournalists had been gathered at the hotel for a press conference held by the rebel 's civilian leader who announced Younis was summoned back to Benghazi and was killed along with his two aides under unclear circumstances , Hider told CNN . \nYounis had served as interior minister in Gadhafi 's government until February , when he defected to the Benghazi-based rebel movement . \nHe was killed along with a colonel and a lieutenant colonel , the rebels ' Transitional National Council said in a statement aired on their television network late Thursday . \nNo further details were immediately released . \nYounis , a onetime general in Gadhafi 's army , told CNN in February that he switched sides after Gadhafi told him he planned to have Benghazi bombed -- a move Younis said would have killed thousands . \nRebel forces have been battling to oust Gadhafi since then , aided by a NATO bombing campaign that has targeted government troops under a U.N. mandate to protect civilians . \nMore explosions rocked Tripoli shortly before midnight Thursday -LRB- 5 p.m. ET -RRB- , indicating fresh airstrikes were under way in the Libyan capital . \nEarlier Thursday , the rebels said their forces had captured five towns and surrounded a sixth in the plains below the Nafusa mountain range , which borders Tunisia . \nHundreds of rebels moved from their mountain positions at dawn . \nWith heavier weapons leading the way with lighter armed fighters following , they initially encountered fierce resistance from Gadhafi 's loyalists . \nCol. Jumma Ibrahim , spokesman for the Military Council for the western mountain region , said several major battles had taken place before the towns were secured . \nHe named the captured towns as al-Ruwais , Takout , al-Jawsh , Bader and al-Ghazzaya , and the surrounded town as Umm al-Far . \nIbrahim said rebels were now negotiating with Gadhafi troops inside Umm al-Far . \nHe said four rebels had been killed in the fighting and at least 20 were wounded , while 20 Gadhafi fighters had been captured . \nThe claimed successes come after one of the biggest rebel offensives in recent weeks and , if true , puts the fighters closer to capturing a significant supply route used by Gadhafi forces . \nIbrahim said that on the eastern side of the mountains , Gadhafi forces had been shelling rebel-held positions near Beir al-Ghanam and also near Qawalish . \nRebel fighters last month suffered heavy casualties in a failed attempt to wrest control of al-Ghazzaya from forces loyal to Gadhafi . \nLast week , rebel fighters manning hilltops in the western mountains overlooking al-Ghazzaya told CNN that they had been watching the government forces reinforcing their weapon stocks with heavy military machinery and rocket launchers . \nThe United Kingdom on Wednesday recognized the Benghazi-based rebels as Libya 's legitimate government , and the United States recently recognized the council as the country 's `` legitimate governing authority .

Kennedy International Airport from Germany , the last part in a journey arranged by the Global Medical Relief Fund , a U.S. nonprofit . \nThe group aids children who have lost the use of , or are missing , limbs or eyes . \nIt says it is funded almost exclusively by donations . \nMalaak and her parents are being housed temporarily at The Ronald McDonald House of Long Island , which shelters families with sick children undergoing treatment at area hospitals . \n`` All the kids that come here , they 're bewildered , reluctant ; and once they 're here , they open up , '' said Elissa Mantonti , founder of the nonprofit . \nMalaak , who arrived in a wheelchair , initially appeared to be tired , but she quickly perked up when the other children housed in the facility came out to greet her . \nShe got off her wheelchair and started exploring a toy room and play space with the other children . \nShe quickly befriended three Iraqi boys who , like her , speak Arabic . \nThey , too , were brought to the U.S. by the nonprofit . \nThey suffered their injuries in Iraq 's continuing violence , according to Mantonti . \nMalaak 's rebel-controlled neighborhood in the western Libyan city of Misrata was attacked by pro-government forces on May 13 . \nA Grad rocket , which looks like an overgrown bullet about 9 feet long and 15 inches around , slammed into her bedroom wall and exploded , causing a gaping hole . \nHer 3-year-old brother and 1-year-old sister died in the attack . \nMalaak 's right leg was severed below the knee in the attack . \nAccording to Mantonti , her organization helped arrange for the family to be ferried by boat from Misrata , which is still under siege from pro-government forces despite recent rebel advances . \nFrom there , the family boarded a flight to Frankfurt , Germany , and continued onward to New York . \nThe girl 's father expressed a mixture of hope and sadness upon his arrival in the U.S. `` I feel joy that my daughter will get treatment for her leg , '' Mustafa Al-Shami said . \n`` At the same time , I feel grief for the loss of my two other children . \nAnd , even though I feel that Malaak may never be the same after the attack , I 'm so happy that she will be able to walk and run again one day .

\nRepublican Leader John Boehner delays a vote on his proposal to fix the U.S. debt crisis . \nWill lawmakers vote on his plan today ? \nAnd one year after devastating floods hit much of Pakistan , many of the victims are still waiting for help . \nMystery surrounds the death of this man , General Abdul Fatah Younis . \nNow , he commanded Libya 's rebel army , and officials say that he was killed , along with two of his senior officers . \nBut we do not know exactly where he was killed or , more importantly , who was behind his death . \nNow , the chairman of the Transitional National Council made this announcement . \nMUSTAFA ABDUL JALIL , CHAIRMAN , LIBYAN TRANSITIONAL NATIONAL COUNCIL -LRB- through translator -RRB- : In deep sadness , we announce the death of General Abdul Fatah Younis , the chief general of the Libyan army , and his two companions , Colonel Mohammed Khamis and Lieutenant Colonel Nasir al - Madhkur . \nSTOUT : Younis had been summoned back to the rebel stronghold of Benghazi to face questions about military matters , and reports say he has alleged ongoing ties to Moammar Gadhafi . \nYou may recall that Younis defected from the Libyan leader 's government back in February . \nHe held the post of interior minister and was considered Colonel Gadhafi 's second in command before his defection . \nNow , Younis ' death leaves the rebel army without a leader as the opposition claims advances in the west . \nIvan Watson joins us live from the Libyan capital of Tripoli . \nAnd Ivan , is there any more information about the circumstances of his death ? \nIVAN WATSON , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : No. . \nThis assassination really raises the specter of the possibility of infighting among rebel ranks , the possibility of a power vacuum within the rebel military command , and a lot of questions about just how this general was killed . \nAccording to the leader of the Transitional National Council , in a very short press conference that he gave last night in the rebel capital of Benghazi , he said that Abdul Fatah Younis had been summoned to Benghazi from the front line around the oil report of Brega and that the assassination occurred somewhere along the way . \nWhat was even stranger was he went on to say that they were trying to find Younis ' body , as well as the attackers who carried out this alleged assassination . \nThere had been a lot of rumors , Kristie , at the time that he was being brought under arrest by the rebel council , and we know that he had engaged in power struggles with another rival rebel commander in the five months that this civil war has been taking place . \nThere was some gunfire from Younis ' supporters last night after the press conference announcing Younis ' death took place , gunfire outside the hotel where the announcement was made . \nWe 've been monitoring Libya Alhurra television , pro-rebel TV , which has been showing a live picture from Benghazi of Friday prayers and some speeches by supporters of Younis who have been vowing vengeance and also pledging support to the Transitional National Council . \nHere in Tripoli , officials have been quite thus far , have not offered any official reaction to the death of a former comrade in arms of Moammar Gadhafi who defected early on to the rebel side . \nWe 're waiting for some kind of reaction from the Gadhafi regime to this very important development -- Kristie . \nSTOUT : And Ivan , what is the state of play on the battlefield ? \nAnd what will be the impact of Younis ' death on the rebels ' ability to fight this civil war ? \nWATSON : Still trying to figure that out . \nIt 's important to note that the ground war is being fought on three fronts -- in the east , around that oil port of Brega ; in the central port of Misrata , which is held by the rebels ; and in the west , along the Tunisian border , where the rebels report they 've made some gains in the last 24 hours . \nTripoli was being bombed by NATO warplanes last night within hours of the announcement of Abdul Fatah Younis ' death , and there has been an increase in the amount of NATO bomb attacks here in the Libyan capital in recent days . \nSome of that footage we can show you . \nSometimes the strikes are quite close and pretty frightening here . \nBut this was described by the U.S. ' top military commander as a stalemate just a few days ago . \nIt will be very interesting to see whether this could be a game-changer in this grinding and bloody five-month conflict , the loss of the main rebel commander -- Kristie . \nSTOUT : Ivan Watson , joining us live from Tripoli . \nAnd while Libya 's rebels have struggled on the battlefield , they are making significant political progress . \nNow , the countries in red on this map , these are the countries that recognize the Transitional National Council as Libya 's legitimate government . \nNow , as you 'll recall , on Wednesday the United Kingdom expelled Colonel Gadhafi 's diplomats and turned the embassy over to the opposition group . \nThat comes less than two weeks after the U.S. officially recognized the rebel government . \nIn Egypt , a demonstration for national unity is being dominated by Islamic groups . \nCairo 's Tahrir Square is packed with protesters . \nSome are political activists who have been camping there for weeks . \nThey say that they are keeping pressure on the country 's military rulers to implement promised reforms . \nIn Syria , a number of people are also expected to take to the streets after prayers . \nNow , let 's bring it up for you . \nThis is a live Web stream . \nIt comes from the city of Hama . \nNow , protesters are trying to topple the regime of President Bashar al - Assad . \nIf we can bring that webcam for you -- we 'll bring it to you a little bit later on the program . \nNow , meanwhile , our Arwa Damon , she says the slogan for today 's rally is `` Your Silence is Deadly . '' \nThat is a criticism of the international community for not taking what they consider sufficient action against President al-Assad . \nMeanwhile , in the United States , members of the House of Representatives could vote later today on Speaker John Boehner 's bill to raise the U.S. debt ceiling . \nAnd if that sounds familiar , it 's because they were meant to vote on the measure on Thursday , but the vote was postponed late in the evening after Boehner failed to rally enough support from within his own party . \nHe has been struggling to come up with a plan that meets demands of the party 's more conservative Tea Party wing . \nREP. JOHN BOEHNER -LRB- R-OH -RRB- , SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE : The bill 's not perfect . \nI 've never said it was perfect , nobody in my caucus believes it 's perfect . \nBut what this bill reflects is a sincere , honest effort to end this crisis in a bipartisan way , to send it to the Senate , where it can receive action . \nSTOUT : Now , Democrats in the Senate say that they will vote down Boehner 's plan if it does eventually pass in the House . \nBoth sides are holding caucus meetings on Friday to work out the next step . \nAnd meanwhile , the clock continues to click toward the big August the 2nd deadline . \nAnd without a plan to raise the U.S. debt ceiling by then , the U.S. could face it 's first-ever default . \nNow , it is something that would not only negatively impact the U.S. economy , but financial institutions around the world . \nSo , does the White House have a backup plan if lawmakers do n't get their act together ? \nMary Snow joins us now from CNN New York with more -- Mary . \nMARY SNOW , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Well , Kristie , the president in this case is legally limited . \nOne constitutional expert at Yale Law School looked at the scenarios where the president could bypass Congress if Congress does n't reach a deal . \nAnd this expert took a look at the question of , could the government just print more money ? \nThe answer is , not unless it came in the form of coins . \nBOEHNER : It 's a zip-a-dee-doo-dah day . \nSNOW -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : And just days until the government can no longer borrow money . \nIf Congress does n't reach an agreement in time , could there be a Plan B for President Obama to act on his own and raise money ? \nFitting under the category of desperate times calling for desperate measures , there is actually some talk of issuing two $ 1 trillion coins . \nConstitutional law expert Jack Balkin says there is a statutory limit on the amount of paper currency that can be in circulation , but not on coins . \nIt 's an idea he calls science fiction . \nJACK BALKIN , YALE LAW SCHOOL : I think what it underscores is that people are now trying to investigate different ways of resolving an artificially created financial crisis , fiscal crisis . \nAnd I think the problem is that these solutions have been offered precisely because the situation we have been put in is so absurd . \nSNOW : A potential option for the president that has been taken more seriously is the idea of him invoking a clause in the 14th Amendment where he would raise the debt ceiling without congressional authorization . \nBut the president himself has indicated that is not on the table . \nBARACK OBAMA , PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES : I have talked to my lawyers . \nThey do not -- they do not -- they are not persuaded that that is a winning argument . \nSNOW : One way for the government to raise money is to sell assets . \nGold now at record highs is one of those assets . \nBut -- JAY POWELL , BIPARTISAN POLICY CENTER : There is no likelihood of that at all . \nIf the United States government were to announce that it was going to sell some gold to pay its bills , one can only imagine what would happen to the price of gold . \nYou would want to be out of the way of that collapsing price . \nSNOW : Jay Powell was undersecretary at the Treasury Department under President George H.W. Bush . \nHe has been briefing members of Congress , saying he 's been separating fact from fiction , even getting asked if the government can issue IOUs . \nPOWELL : If the debt ceiling is not increased , if no deal is made , then people need to understand there 's no secret bag of tricks , there 's no magic bullet that will allow us to avoid defaulting on our non-debt-related payments . \nSNOW : Bottom line , Jay Powell says , is there 's nothing really the executive branch can practically do in the absence of a deal -- Kristie . \nAnd for more on the political ramifications of the debt crisis , CNN senior political analyst David Gergen joins us now from CNN London . \nAnd David , this has become a huge test for the Speaker of the House . \nNow , why is it that House Speaker John Boehner was not able to get support from his own party , and what is at stake for him ? \nDAVID GERGEN , CNN SR. . \nPOLITICAL ANALYST : Well , there 's a great deal more at stake for the country and for the world , of course , but this is a crisis for John Boehner . \nIf he can not win this vote , he may well lose his speakership over time . \nI think it 's important to keep in mind that his problem is he has 240 members . \nThere are no Democrats willing to vote for his plan . \nAnd he can only lose about 23 . \nBut see that in context . \nThat means he has about 90 percent of his caucus with him . \nHe has 90 percent of Republicans in the House with him . \nThere 's another 10 percent that 's holding out , and they want deeper cuts . \nThey want something more significant . \nThey 're the mostly Tea Party types who were elected with an avalanche of criticism of Washington coming from the grassroots of America . \nAnd it 's been hard for him to corral . \nBut right now they are in danger if -- I think they have to vote today . \nI think we 've entered a crucial 24-hour period , and I think they will -- it will have to come up or come down today , because we do n't have time now . \nWe 're down to the final strokes . \nSTOUT : That 's right . \nWe only have four days left . \nNow , I want to ask you about the overall political tone of this debate . \nIn the U.S. , the debt limit has been raised dozens of times in recent years , but without the extreme partisan bickering that we 've been seeing in recent weeks . \nSo why is the climate so different this time around ? \nGERGEN : Well , I think the debt ceiling offered a tool , if you would , that Republicans could latch on to , to bring home and force reductions in spending . \nThis fight has been brewing for a long , long time , and the United States is deeply polarized about the size and shape of government . \nHow big should government be ? \nHow much should the federal government spend ? \nI mean , the Republicans basically want government to spend about 18 percent of GDP on its activities , whereas Democrats say no , we 'd like it around 23 or so . \nThat may sound small , the difference between 18 and 23 , but when you translate it into dollars , it 's actually huge . \nIt 's about $ 700 billion a year and a difference and a vision of what the government ought to do . \nSo , that 's part of the fight . \nAnd there 's also , frankly , a growing fear in the country that we 've allowed the national debt to grow so rapidly , that it really could lead to the decline of America -- a reduction in growth , and in fact would impact the world . \nThere 's a serious study that has been well accepted now across the world by two economists named Ken Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart . \nThey 're world class economists who have studied 800 years of financial crises , and one of their main conclusions is that a country which allows its debt , its public debt to grow to more than 90 percent of its gross national product , its GDP , is a country that 's in trouble , and we 'll see its growth rate decline and may stumble into a lost decade , as Japan did . \nWell , the United States , if you add federal debt to state and local , it 's past 90 percent now . \nAnd so there 's a real fear of the direction we 're moving . \nAnd responsible people on both sides of the aisle want to get the debt down . \nThe differences are on how you do it , whether you cut government a lot or whether you raise taxes and cut government some . \nAnd those are pretty fundamental differences . \nSTOUT : Yes , it 's a clash of two fundamentally different philosophies . \nThe last question for you , David Gergen , you have been an adviser to numerous U.S. presidents . \nI wanted to get your thoughts on President Obama 's leadership and his handling of the debt crisis so far . \nGERGEN : Let me be very clear that all sides in this conflict have their fingerprints all over and bear responsible for this disaster . \nI mean , this is an embarrassment , for the United States to be in this position . \nIt 's telling the world our political system does n't work very well and so forth , and certainly there are a lot of people very deeply concerned in the financial community . \nDoes the president bear some responsibility ? \nHas his leadership been all that it should have been ? \nMuch earlier in the game , where there was something called the Bowles - Simpson Commission that reported and had a pathway to a $ 4 trillion reduction in our deficits over the next 10 years , had Republican support within the commission , had the president seized that report back in December of last year and it pushed it with that kind of bipartisanship that went into the report , I think he would have secured an agreement a lot faster , and a much bigger agreement . \nWere there other moments along the way ? \nIf Lyndon Johnson were in the White House right now he 'd be bringing people in , he 'd be knocking heads together , he 'd be corralling people . \nHe 'd be exploiting their weaknesses , making tradeoffs , and you 'd probably get a deal . \nBarack Obama is a more cerebral individual . \nHe has many , many strengths . \nLeading the Congress and corralling people in Congress is not one of his strengths . \nNow , the U.S. debt problem has led to one curious statistic I 'd like to share with you . \nNow , take a look at this . \nAt the end of Wednesday , July the 27th , the U.S. Treasury had a closing balance of just under $ 74 billion . \nBut according to Apple 's most recent earnings statement -- check it out -- Apple has over $ 76 billion in cash and marketable securities , meaning the U.S. Treasury has less cash on hand than the maker of the iPhone . \nNow , Spain 's prime minister has set a date for a general election four months earlier than planned . \nJose Luis Zapatero says Spain will go to the polls on November the 20th , and that will allow a new government to be in power by the end of the year to help restore financial stability there . \nAhead on NEWS STREAM , the crisis in Somalia . \nU.N. aid arrives , but then the violence picks up . \nWe 'll get the latest on the situation there through the eyes of a refugee doctor . \nPlus , it has been one year since massive flooding ravaged parts of Pakistan . \nWe 'll see how they 're coping now . \nAnd as Norway continues to mourn the massacre one week ago today , police there are meeting again with the man who has admitted he is responsible . \nNow , many Somali families have fled the famine gripping the country . \nSome have walked hundreds of kilometers with limited food and water in the hopes of receiving safe assistance . \nITV 's Martin Geissler brings us the latest on their plight and looks at the staff working for their welfare . \nMARTIN GEISSLER , ITV NEWS -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : This is the front line in the fight against Somalia 's famine . \nWith basic facilities and equipment , the staff at Hagadera do extraordinary work . \nWith each new day , John Kiogora and his team of medics know they 'll face crises in this intensive care ward . \nThey 've seen it all here many , many times . \nAnd first thing this morning , they saw it again . \nDR. JOHN KIOGORA , INTERNATIONAL RESCUE COMMITTEE : Very sick , you see . \nThe child is severely malnourished . \nGEISSLER : Abdi Rahman -LRB- ph -RRB- is 1 year old and unconscious . \n-LRB- on camera -RRB- : What are your chances of saving a child like this ? \nKIOGORA : Fifty-fifty now . \nWe 've seen a child like this and you just want to do your best . \nGEISSLER : Every minute is crucial at this stage . \nThe team give Abdi Rahman -LRB- ph -RRB- a glucose boost . \nFluids now are his only chance . \n-LRB- on camera -RRB- : So there 's still some reason to hope ? \nKIOGORA : Yes , there 's some hope still . \nWe have n't given up . \nYou ca n't give up , yes . \nGEISSLER -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Fifteen minutes were all it took for this dramatic change . \nKIOGORA : The child is coming up , huh ? \nGEISSLER : Hooked up to a drip , the baby has been revived . \nSo that 's the most I keep saying , because the child -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- . \nHe was actually dying -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- . \nGEISSLER : Lunch for the staff in this field hospital is quick and simple . \nThen the afternoon roams -LRB- ph -RRB- . \nSeven-month-old Minaj -LRB- ph -RRB- , so ill at the start of this week , is improving , as is Abdi -LRB- ph -RRB- . \nOn the critical list for days , he 's now eating solid food . \nThe work does n't pay well , but there are priceless rewards . \n-LRB- on camera -RRB- : Being a doctor though , as a human being , that 's just a magical moment . \nIt 's very good . \nIt 's something very -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- to me . \nGEISSLER -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Thirty years old , from a small town in the Kenyan highlands , John has learned fast he does n't just save lives , he brings them into the world , too . \nHe delivered this baby yesterday across the compound in Hagadera 's maternity unit . \nUp to 80 children are born here each week . \n-LRB- on camera -RRB- : Dadaab is a hard place to start your life , is n't it ? \nKIOGORA : It is difficult . \nIt 's a hard -LRB- ph -RRB- place , but this is the best for famine , because -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- , and they get the care that you can give them . \nGEISSLER -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : This evening , in the intensive care ward , Abdi Rahman -LRB- ph -RRB- is receiving that care . \nBut his chances are still 50-50 . \nJohn and his team ca n't save everyone . \nThe ward loses a couple of children most weeks . \nKIOGORA : I 've done my best to -- I mean , ca n't change the nature . \nI can only save the doomed and -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- as far as medicine is concerned . \nGEISSLER : Another long day over , there 's a chance to reflect and prepare for whatever tomorrow might bring . \nSTOUT : Martin Geissler reporting there . \nNow , the site , it has a wealth of information on how you can help , including links to reputable aid agencies working there in the region . \nNow , ahead on NEWS STREAM , the waters may have receded , but a lot of the damage still remains . \nWe 'll see how Pakistan is coping one year on from its record flooding . \nSTOUT : I 'm Kristie Lu Stout in Hong Kong . \nYou 're watching News Stream . \nAnd these are your world headlines . \nNow U.S. lawmakers are still in gridlock over the government 's debt ceiling . \nRepublican John Boehner , the U.S. House Speaker , had to scrap plans for a vote on his deficit cutting bill on Thursday . \nNot enough members of his own party supported it . \nRepublicans may try again today . \nBut even if the House passes the bill , Democrats who have the majority in the Senate have vowed to block it . \nNow Libya 's rebels have lost their army chief . \nGeneral Abdul Fattah Younis was killed along with two officers . \nThe circumstances of their death remain unclear . \nGeneral Younis was Libya 's former Interior minister and Moammar Gadhafi 's second in command before switching sides in February . \nA woman who worked on the campaign with the no defunct News of the World after her daughter was murdered has learned that her phone may have been hacked . \nAs Sarah Payne previously defended the newspaper . \nIn its final addition she wrote that it was a force for good . \nAnd the only surviving gunman from the 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai is challenging his death sentence . \nMore than 160 people died in the three day coordinated attack . \nIndia 's supreme court says Mohammed Ajmal Kasab 's appeal was sent by authorities from the Mumbai jail where he is being held . \nAnd no date has been set for a hearing . \nNow police in Norway plan to interview this man , Ander Behring Breivik today for a second time . \nThey say that investigators have gained new information since the last time they spoke to him . \nNow that was one day after last Friday 's terror attacks . \nBreivik has confessed to carrying out the shootings on Utoya Island as well as the bombing in Oslo . \nAnd he is currently in solitary confinement in a prison near Oslo . \nNow it is one week to the day since Breivik 's rampage left at least 76 people dead . \nAnd on this day a memorial service in central Oslo . \nThe youth movement of the ruling Labor Party organized the event . \nAnd members were holding a summer camp on Utoya Island when Breivik began shooting them . \nNow the pictures you are watching were filmed at the service just a short time ago . \nIn South Korea , rescue efforts go on , but the deluge just wo n't stop . \nThe heaviest rains in a century have killed more than 50 people . \nNow outside Seoul people in five neighborhoods have been told to evacuate their homes . \nAnd most of those who died were overwhelmed by mudslides triggered by the rain . \nNow the country faces a daunting clean-up operation . \nPaula Hancocks has more . \nPAULA HANCOCKS , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : A huge amount has changed here in Seoul in just the last 24 hours . \nThe sun is now shining , the weather has improved dramatically . \nAnd I brought you here to one of the inner city streams to show you just how radically the water levels have receded . \nOn Thursday I would n't be able to stand on this bridge . \nThere was a ferocious torrent of water that was coming down here . \nThe paths on both sides were completely covered and the water levels were several feet higher . \nWe 've also had confirmation this Friday of just how historic these floods were . \nKorea 's Meteorological Administration says that the past three days broke all records , 536 millimeters of rain fell , that 's more than 21 inches . \nAnd also Wednesday was the heaviest daily rainfall in July since records began . \nNow as well as the search and rescue operation , you are also seeing now the clean up operation . \nVolunteers are helping , the police , the military , civil service . \nThere 's 34,000 people working on the clean up operation nationwide , 11,000 in Seoul alone . \nPoliticians as well are also postponing their meetings so that they can be seen to be about and to be helping with the effort . \nOne concern at an artillery unit on Mount Umyon . \nThe Defense Ministry tells us at least 10 landmines are yet to be retrieved around this military base due to these landslides . \nBut the administration also insists that concrete blocks have been set up to make sure that they ca n't fly down the mountain into the civilian areas . \nIt is not just south Korea that has been affected , it is the entire Korean Peninsula . \nNorth Korea 's state media says that these storms have caused severe damage across the country . \nThe state run television , KRT , is showing video of flooded areas , of damaged crops , and also a collapsed bridge in the southern Hwanghae Province just north of the border with South Korea . \n522 millimeters , or 20 inches of rain fell in 12 hours , according to KRT . \nWe do n't yet have word on any possible casualties from North Korea . \nAnd it 's possible we wo n't hear word of possible casualties . \nNow the worst is certainly over for the Korean peninsula . \nThe weather has been punishing over the past few days . \nAnd the intensity of these rains have surprised everybody . \nSTOUT : Now one year ago a slow motion tsunami swept over Pakistan . \nThat is how the United Nations chief described the devastating floods that covered nearly one-fifth of the country . \nAnd let 's show you how that looks over Europe . \nNow those waters killed 2,000 people and destroyed 1.6 million homes , a huge affected area . \nNow many people in Pakistan still are in dire need of help , but as Reza Sayah shows us , it is yet to arrive . \nREZA SAYAH , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : Here in Pakistan you find poverty in a lot of places , but where we are right now this is probably the depths of poverty . \nIn villages like Kut Almo -LRB- ph -RRB- in southern Sindh Province , the right kind of help never reaches children like Shulkit Ali -LRB- ph -RRB- , a 5 year old boy with symptoms of liver disease . \nBut when Pakistan 's monster floods devastated the settlement one year ago , people here hoped the disaster would shed light on the wretched conditions they have suffered for years . \nThey hoped help would finally come . \nBut as a visit to Kut Almo -LRB- ph -RRB- makes clear , help has not come . \nNothing for the past year . \nWe 've had nothing , '' says Shulkit 's -LRB- ph -RRB- mother Sabbab Bajaj -LRB- ph -RRB- . \nThe 2010 floods left one-fifth of Pakistan under water , an area roughly the size of Italy . \nResidence of Kut Almo -LRB- ph -RRB- were among the thousands rescued and taken to refugee camps where they waited for months for the floods to recede . \nEventually they came back . \nVillagers here say over the past year at most three or four times aid workers have stopped by here , dropped off some building material and relief goods , but today they 're still going without some of the most basic needs to survive . \n`` What has the government given us ? '' \nSays Khatim Shah -LRB- ph -RRB- . \n`` They just gave us a little something to eat , but it 's gone . \nThey have given us nothing . '' \nMany of the homes remain demolished here . \nMost of the water pumps still do n't work . \nThere 's about 120 kids in this village and none of them go to school . \nAnd here 's why . \nThis used to be their school and look at it . \nDestroyed by the flood waters a year ago , you can see some flood debris . \nThis is Khatim Ali -LRB- ph -RRB- . \nThat 's the flood line . \nHe 's pointing to the flood line up there probably about 15 feet high . \nMost men here are farmers . \nThe floods wiped away their land . \nToday many still do n't have jobs . \nEverywhere you look in this village there are signs of disease with no sign of medical help in a region with a history of neglect . \nA $ 20 vaccine would have probably saved Ishbak -LRB- ph -RRB- from polio when he was a baby , but today he 's a cripple living in this flood ravaged village . \nOne year after Pakistan 's floods , aid groups say hundreds of thousands are still homeless . \nThe UN 's appeal for $ 2 billion is not even three - quarters of a way to its goal . \nShulkit Ali 's -LRB- ph -RRB- family hope the floods would showcase his medical condition for the world , but that has n't happened . \nWith the media attention all but gone , his family asks if not now then when . \nReza Sayah , CNN , Southern Sindh , Pakistan . \nSTOUT : Let 's keep our focus on Pakistan and how that slow motion tsunami struck the country one year ago today . \nOur Mari Ramos is at the World Weather Center . \nShe joins us now -- Mari . \nMARI RAMOS , CNN WEATHER CORRESPONDENT : Kristie , those images that Reza was showing us is really amazing . \nAnd I remember a year ago when we were covering this story how surprised we were to see all of that rain and how it just kept going and going and it would n't stop . \nNow you know that 's what we saw right now with South Korea , with Seoul , with all of that historic rainfall . \nWell , that 's kind of what happened in Pakistan , except the topography is different . \nAnd the rain did n't stop in Pakistan . \nLet me go ahead and show you first of all this image . \nCan -- oh , I guess you ca n't see it , I 'm sorry . \nWell , let 's go ahead and -- let me go ahead and show you kind of -- a little bit of an explainer of what actually happened here . \nFirst of all , the rainfall that happened on July 29 and 30 , that 's when we say that it started around this time . \nThey had in 24 hours more than 270 millimeters of rain . \nCompare that to their monthly average right here . \nWhen they had all of this rain across this northern portion here of Pakistan . \nAnd then , it just continued to rain over the next few days , an all-time -- new all-time record was made around that time . \n70 percent above average rainfall in July , 104 percent above average as we headed into August . \nSo this kind of kept going . \nWhen all of that water came along it came down from the mountains , it flooded the Indus River . \nIt flooded the tributaries . \nAnd all of that happened very , very slowly . \nAreas continue to flood . \nSome areas dams failed and then you had flooding in areas that had never flooded before . \nAnd that crest continued to travel farther and farther to the south very , very slowly . \nI remember talking about that flood crest a week and two weeks and three weeks and four weeks after the flood still had not reached the sea , which was incredible . \nAnd then it took months for that water to continue going down . \nRight now at least over the last two weeks we 've had a little bit of above average rainfall across northern Pakistan . \nBelow average rainfall in areas to the south . \nThe southwest monsoon is in full swing right now . \nThis is the rainy season again that we 're dealing with here . \nThe heaviest rain has actually been across parts of India . \nIn some cases over 200 millimeters of rain in areas particularly in the north . \nBut , you know what , this is what we would expect . \nWe have n't seen extreme amounts of rain like we did last year and certainly not in Pakistan . \nWe 've had some bursts of some very heavy rain across portions of India , but overall the monsoon is right around where it should be for this time of year . \nLet 's go ahead and take a look at your forecast now . \nAnd talk about the differences from one country , from one area to the other . \nPaula Hancocks was just showing us from Seoul how the water had pretty much left the river and areas that she could n't be standing a couple of days ago are generally dry now , because of the topography there in Seoul , that water drained very quickly into the ocean . \nIn Pakistan , it took months for that to happen . \nThere you see the satellite image right now for the Korean peninsula . \nMuch dryer now than it was just a few days ago . \nSome scattered rain showers expected . \nSome pop up thunderstorms on and off . \nNot out of the question over the next few days , probably a better chance as we head into late Sunday and into Monday , but we 're not expecting anything like what we saw in the last few days . \nSo a little bit of good news there , Kristie . \nAnd finally , I do want to update you on Tropical Storm Nock-Ten . \nThis is the one that moved first into the Philippines , then into the South China Sea . \nIt 's one that gave you the typhoon 3 signal in Hong Kong for a little while yesterday . \nThat signal is down . \nThe storm actually made landfall in Hynan . \nAnd it is now moving into Vietnam . \nA lot of rainfall associated with this weather system . \nIt should continue to weaken as it moves inland . \nI am concerned about the rain , though . \nWe 'll watch it through the weekend here on CNN . \nSTOUT : All right . \nThank you and take care . \nAnd ahead here on News Stream , discovering the truth . \nNow secrets that were submerged underwater are now finally coming to light . \nWe 'll have the latest on the investigation into the crash of Air France flight 447 . \nNow this is a 3D sketch up of the Air Fracen jet that tragically went down during a flight from Rio to Paris two years ago killing all 228 people on board . \nNow the details surrounding Air France flight 447 , including the cause of the crash , were largely a mystery until recently . \nNow just this past May , the French authority BEA recovered the plane 's flight recorders from the bottom of the Ocean . \nIt has helped shape BEA 's third report that has just been released . \nNow Jim Bittermann joins us now live from Paris with more details . \nAnd Jim , walk us through the latest findings . \nJIM BITTERMANN , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : Well , basically this was the third but not the final report . \nThe final report is expected at the end of the year . \nAnd basically with each one of these interim reports we 're finding out a little bit more about what happened in the final seconds of that ill fated flight . \nIn this report , I think we 're beginning to see more and more fingers pointed at the crew . \nBasically the report said that the crew had had no training for this kind of high altitude stall that they faced . \nIt also points out , however , that there were a lot of things happening at once . \nSome false indications coming in from the various parts of the aircraft equipment -- a stall warning horn going on and coming off and giving a bad indication of whether the plane had actually stalled . \nSo pilots groups here , victims associations , and Air France are pushing back at the idea that the crew may have been to blame . \nIn fact Air France said right after this report was issued a couple of hours ago , they said there 's no reason at this stage to question the crews technical skills . \nSo as the Transport minister here said this morning , while these reports are giving more and more details of what happened , the actual blame for this crash , and of course there are million perhaps hundreds of millions of euros and dollars resting on the outcome in terms of the lawsuits involved , that the adjudication of any blame is going to wait for the courts . \nSo basically these reports are interesting reading . \nThey 're giving some indication . \nBut like I said , a final report is due at the end of this year -- Kristie . \nSTOUT : Now this is the third in four reports . \nWhat is the bottom line here , Jim . \nAfter going through all these reports , could the tragedy of Air France flight 447 been avoided if the pilots were better trained ? \nBITTERMANN : Well , that 's a good question . \nWell , the fact is they were getting a lot of contradictory information in a very short period of time . \nSo they had to interpret the data that was coming into them . \nNow if they had interpreted correctly , and there had been other times when this kind of air speed indicator problem had cropped up , the other times when the crews had successfully managed the situation . \nThey did n't in this case . \nAnd of course that will be the argument that 's at the crux of any kind of a court case . \nIt certainly is the argument right now , because basically when blame is finally affixed , either by the accident investigators or by the courts as the Transport minister suggested -- when blame is affixed , then of course if it 's going to be Air Bus , the makers of the aircraft , or Air France who were providing the pilots and training the pilots , those are going to be libel for a lot of damages . \nSo there 's going to be a lot of argument over exactly that point . \nCould it have been avoided ? \nIt could have been avoided , of course , if the equipment had n't failed . \nIt could have been avoided if the crew had performed better . \nBut one way or the other , those are going to be the arguments that are going to come out in court -- Kristie . \nSTOUT : All right . \nJim Bittermann joining us live from Paris . \nAnd now to the latest twist in a scandal that has reached the highest levels of the UK . \nNow a mother who worked on a campaign with the now defunct News of the World tabloid after her daughter 's murder now says that her phone was hacked . \nNow senior international correspondent Dan Rivers is following the story in London . \nDAN RIVERS , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : The official inquiry into phone hacking has been started by Lord Justice Brian Levenson in the building behind me . \nBut only a few hours after he set out the sort of mechanics of how that long inquiry were run , there was another shocking allegation in the phone hacking scandal , the suggestion that Sarah Payne , the mother of the murdered 8 year old Sarah Payne , had her phone targeted by the News of the World . \nNow this is especially shocking , because Sarah Payne worked closely with the News of the World to campaign for greater information about pedophiles living in different areas and campaigned for the introduction of the so-called Sarah 's Law to give parents the right to know if a pedophile was living in their area . \nIndeed , she even wrote an article in the last addition of the News of the World saying News of the World proved that it is a force for good . \nIn light of this suggestion that her phone may have been targeted by an investigator working for the paper , Sarah Payne 's agent put out a statement saying that she was devastated by the news . \nIt went on , `` we are all deeply disappointed and are just working to get her through it . '' \nRebekah Brooks , the former editor of the paper at the time , and the former chief executive of News International also put out a statement saying these allegations are abhorrent and particularly upsetting as Sarah Payne is a dear friend . \nThe idea of her being targeted is beyond my comprehension . \nIt 's an issue that Lord Justice Brian Leveson will no doubt look at as well as the wider issue of the ethics in journalism in the UK . \nAnd also allegations of a cozy and almost corrupt relationship between certain journalists and the police . \nSTOUT : The story that does n't seem to end . \nYou 're watching News Stream live on CNN . \nWe 'll be back right after this . \nNow over the years people have been finding the face of Jesus in many objects , but now we are hearing about some divine vines . \nJeanne Moos takes a closer look at the holy foliage . \nJEANNE MOOS , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Do you see just overgrown vines on a telephone pole or does this look the big operator in the sky ? \nMOOS : Now often these Jesus sightings require lots of imagination , whether it be Jesus on a moth , or Cheeto Jesus . \nMOOS : Even the famous Virgin Mary on a grilled cheese could arguably be Madonna . \nBut this telephone pole in Middleton , Colorado strikes most people the same way . \nWhat do you see here ? \nMOOS : Folks pointed out what looks like a crown of thorns , the body 's positioning . \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : Oh , and then look at the legs . \nLike , you know it 's like -- yeah . \nHe 's like that . \nMOOS : But while you might think a telephone pole Jesus is pretty unique . \nIt turns out he 's not alone . \nVine covered utility poles have been sprouting religious images for years all over the country . \nMOOS : From North Carolina to Louisiana . \nThat looks put there by him . \nMOOS : This one in Lake Charles , Louisiana from last fall was said to be most striking when seen as you drove by . \nAnd while one local was quoted as saying you ca n't spray Jesus with Roundup , workers did cut down the vines . \nOfficials were worried believers would climb the pole to touch the greenery then get an electrifying jolt . \nNow if you 're having trouble seeing Jesus on telephone poles , maybe what you need is the Jesus pan . \nIt 's supposed to put the image of Jesus right on food . \nAdvertising for the Jesus pan says imagine serving heavenly hot cakes at the next church breakfast . \nOf course , the image of Jesus was much clearer when an episode of Glee focused on the topic . \nMOOS : Finn did n't just make the sandwich , he prayed to it . \nMOOS : Ca n't say that about a phone pole that looks like a holy Chia pet . \nMOOS : But what is he saying . \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : He 's saying call your mother . \nSTOUT : Now shares of Nintendo , they plunged around 20 percent on Friday . \nAnd that was its biggest fall in the last two decades . \nAnd it shows how worried investors are about the company 's direction . \nNow Nintendo had been enjoying plenty of success with the Wii . \nNow unlike the Xbox 360 or Playstation 3 , the Wii did not offer the latest high definition graphics , but instead used that revolutionary controller that sensed your movements . \nBut Wii sales have slowed , so Nintendo pinned their hopes on a new console , the 3DS . \nNow it is a handheld that can display 3D without the need for special glasses , but it has n't quite caught on with consumers . \nNow Nintendo has sold only 710,000 now forcing it to cut prices by 40 percent in Japan , over 30 percent in the U.S. Nintendo needs a boost and soon . \nSo this is the company 's latest console . \nIt 's called the Wii U. And it 's not due until the middle of next year . \nNow we will have much more business news just ahead on World Business Today . \nThat is it for News Stream . \nYou 're watching CNN . \n"}

'' \nAt the same time he spoke , Sarkozy said the French air force is opposing any aggression by Gadhafi 's forces against the population of rebel-held Benghazi . \n`` As of now , our aircraft are preventing planes from attacking the town , '' Sarkozy said . \n`` Other French aircraft are ready to intervene against tanks . '' \nSarkozy said enforcing the U.N. no-fly zone through military action is not in order to impose a specific outcome -- such as regime change -- but is instead `` in the name of the universal conscience that will not endorse such crimes . '' \nU.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton echoed that idea , saying the purpose of enforcing the U.N. resolution is `` to protect civilians from their own government . '' \nSarkozy said Gadhafi still has a chance to `` avoid the worst '' if he complies `` immediately and unreservedly '' with the demands of the international community . \n`` The doors of diplomacy will open once again when the aggression stops , '' he said . \nSarkozy 's comments came at the end of Saturday 's meeting , which included delegations from the United States , Canada , European Union and Britain , along with Iraq , Morocco , the United Arab Emirates and the United Nations . \nIn a communique , leaders said they have a long-term commitment in the area . \n`` We assure the Libyan people of our determination to be at their side to help them realize their aspirations and build their future and institutions within a democratic framework , '' the statement said . \nBritish Prime Minister David Cameron , who was at the meeting in Paris , said participants decided to make Gadhafi face the consequences of his actions . \n`` Colonel Gadhafi has made this happen , '' Cameron told the BBC . \n`` He has lied to the international community . \nHe has promised a cease-fire , he has broken that cease-fire , he continues to brutalize his own people , and so the time for action has come . \nIt needs to be urgent . '' \nAs they met , participants were `` aware of the news reports '' coming out of Libya that show Libyan government forces moving toward Benghazi , a senior U.S. State Department official told reporters . \n`` Time is pressing , '' Herman Van Rompuy , president of the European Council , told the meeting Saturday . \n`` Action is needed now to protect the population . '' \nClinton said Gadhafi 's forces `` face unambiguous terms '' and that a cease-fire must be implemented immediately . \n`` That means all attacks against civilians must stop , '' she said after the Paris meeting . \n`` Troops must stop advancing on Benghazi and pull back from Ajdabiya , Misrata and Zawiya . \nWater , electricity , and gas supplies must be turned on to all areas . \nHumanitarian assistance must be allowed to reach the people of Libya .

Security Council passed a resolution authorizing the use of force , including a no-fly zone , to `` protect civilians and civilian populated areas '' from government attack . \nHere is a look at how the situation got to this point , and what the major players are saying and doing . \nTHE START OF THE CONFLICT Libya 's civil war began last month , following protests that coincided with a larger wave of demonstrations in North Africa and the Middle East against governments there . \nThe Tomahawk cruise missiles that were launched Saturday against Libya are unmanned , single-use , programmable jet-engine missiles used only by the U.S. and British navies . \nThey fly very close to the ground , steering around natural and man-made obstacles to hit a target that is programmed into them before launch . \nNewer versions can be reprogrammed in flight but in this case that was not done , at least not yet . \nThey are different from other unmanned aerial vehicles in that they can only be used once -- they are fired , they fly to the target and blow up . \nA Predator and some other unmanned aerial vehicles can carry missiles , hit a target , then continue flying . \nTomahawk missiles normally carry a 1,000-pound conventional warhead . \nThey can also carry 166 combined-effects bomblets , or mini bombs that spread out over a larger area . \nThey can also carry nuclear warheads . \nTomahawks , developed in the 1970s , were first launched operationally by the United States during Operation Desert Storm in 1991 . \nThey are about 18 feet long with a wing span of nearly 9 feet , and they can fly at about 550 mph . \nRegarding Saturday 's strikes against Libya , Vice Adm.

{"id": "31", "time": "2011-03-19", "text": "By the CNN Wire Staff Libya opposition : Civilian areas shelled Libya says it is not engaging advancing rebel forces Libya invites international observers to visit country Libyan troops must pull back from several cities , Obama says Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A fighter jet was shot down and burst into flames Saturday in the area of Benghazi , Libya . \nExplosions could also be heard in the city , which has been a stronghold for rebels opposing Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi . \nIt was not immediately clear who the fighter jet belonged to . \nThe development is significant , in part , because Benghazi has been considered the center of the opposition forces . \nThe opposition has been pushed back from other cities that it used to have control of , and rebels have vowed to defend Benghazi to the death . \nA day earlier , the Libyan government said it was abiding by a cease-fire , but witnesses have said violence from pro-Gadhafi forces have continued . \nLibya late Friday called for international observers to come and verify the cease-fire . \nOne day after the approval of a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing the use of force to protect civilians , U.S. President Barack Obama warned Gadhafi to pull back from several besieged cities -- or face military consequences . \nBut Obama insisted that American troops will not be deployed in Libya . \nU.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was flying to Paris for a Saturday meeting with European allies and Arab partners . \nAt least 28 people died and hundreds were wounded as fighting raged in the cities of Misrata , Ajdabiya and Zintan on Friday , according to Khaled el-Sayeh , military spokesman for the opposition . \nstill hopeful for airstrikes Libya 's deputy foreign minister called for observers from China , Malta , Turkey and Germany `` to come to Libya as soon as possible ... to make sure that there is a real cease-fire on the ground . '' \nKhaled Kaim also noted that the `` door is open for any other countries to send observers . '' \nKaim said the media is distorting Libyan military actions and said the country has evidence of `` crimes against humanity conducted by the rebels . '' \nGovernment forces `` did not cause the deaths of any civilians , '' instead inflicting casualties on armed rebel militias , and will not assault Benghazi , Kaim said . \nForces loyal to Gadhafi are honoring a cease-fire and are not fighting a militia group that is making advances in the eastern part of the country , according to Kaim . \nRebel forces are advancing on the town of al-Migrun , south of the rebel stronghold of Benghazi , said Kaim . \nThe French press agency AFP confirmed to CNN the movement by a militia group and said it recorded video . \nWitnesses in the western city of Misrata said earlier Friday that a pro-government assault is persisting and casualties are mounting as countries backing the council 's move , such as Britain and France , get their military resources into place to enforce the measure . \n`` What cease-fire ? '' \nasked a doctor in Misrata , who described hours of military poundings , casualties and dwindling resources to treat the wounded . \n`` We 're under the bombs . \n`` This morning , they are burning the city , '' the doctor said . \n`` There are deaths everywhere . '' \n`` Misrata is on fire , '' according to an opposition member , who said tanks and vehicles with heavy artillery shot their way into the city Thursday night and the assault continued Friday . \nHe said Gadhafi 's regime announced a cease-fire to buy time for itself . \n`` Please help us . '' \nOutside Ajdabiya in eastern Libya , CNN 's Arwa Damon said she heard explosions , listened to fighters ' accounts of heavy casualties and saw ambulances . \nShe said fighters , who do n't trust Gadhafi , believe that the declaration is a trick . \n`` Everybody around us is on very high alert , still expecting the worst , '' Damon said . \nEl-Sayeh said 26 people died in Misrata , 83 were seriously wounded and hundreds were slightly wounded . \nIn Ajdabiya , two died , three were seriously wounded and hundreds were slightly wounded . \nThere was no immediate casualty count for Zintan , el-Sayeh said . \nCNN could n't independently confirm the witness accounts , and it is impossible to tell whether word of the cease-fire declaration trickled down to pro-government forces . \nFrustration and anger in Benghazi Libyan rebel : We 've seen heavy gunfire No-fly zone a slippery slope to more ? \nIn remarks televised around the globe , Libyan Foreign Minister Moussa Koussa said in Tripoli that the country decided on `` an immediate cease-fire and the stoppage of all military operations . '' \nHe noted that the country , since it is a member of the United Nations , is `` obliged to accept the Security Council resolution that permits the use of force to protect the civilian population . '' \nObama said Friday that `` left unchecked , we have every reason to believe Gadhafi -LRB- will -RRB- commit atrocities against his own people '' and the surrounding region could be destabilized . \nPower and water must be restored to several cities , he added . \n`` These terms are not negotiable , '' Obama said . \nIf Gadhafi does n't comply , the U.N. resolution will be imposed through military action , the president said . \nThe U.N. resolution , while not authorizing such a move , does not preclude the United States from arming rebels , the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations said Friday . \nAmbassador Susan Rice told CNN 's `` Situation Room '' that the `` U.S. is ready to act '' and that Gadhafi `` should be under no illusions that if he does n't act immediately he will face swift and sure consequences , including military action . '' \nWhen asked whether the United States was planning to provide weapons to the opposition , Rice replied , `` We are focused immediately on protection of civilians , on ensuring that the march to Benghazi does not continue and that those who are most vulnerable have the rights and protections that they deserve . '' \nKoussasaid that Libya plans to protect civilians and provide them with humanitarian assistance and that it is obliged to protect all foreigners and their assets . \nHe said the Libya government was disappointed in the imposition of a no-fly zone , arguing that it will hurt the civilian population . \nHe also said the use of military power would violate the country 's sovereignty and go against the U.N. charter , but he acknowledged that some countries may yet intervene . \n`` There are signs this indeed might take place , '' Koussa said . \nBernard Valero , a French Foreign Ministry spokesman , said the cease-fire announcement `` does not change the threat on the ground . '' \n`` Gadhafi is privy to folkloric declarations , and we must remain extremely vigilant with regards to these declarations , '' he said . \nClinton , who called the situation `` fluid and dynamic , '' said the United States wants actions , not words . \n`` We will continue to work with our partners in the international community to press Gadhafi to leave and to support the legitimate aspirations of the Libyan people , '' she said . \nThe Libyan government `` must immediately cease all hostilities against the civilian population , '' U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Friday in Madrid . \nEarlier Friday , talk emerged in Europe of speedy military action against Gadhafi 's regime . \nIn an interview with RTL radio , French government spokesman Francois Baroin said France plans to participate in `` swift '' efforts . \nPresident Nicolas Sarkozy will convene a summit Saturday to look at the crisis . \nInvited are members of the Arab League , the president of the European Council and representatives of states that support the implementation of the U.N. resolution . \nBritish Prime Minister David Cameron said the United Kingdom has started preparations to deploy aircraft , and `` in the coming hours '' they will move to air bases where they will be positioned for any `` necessary action . '' \nSpain will offer NATO the use of two military bases and provide air and naval forces for use in operations involving Libya , Spanish Defense Minister Carme Chacon said Friday in Madrid , a Defense Ministry spokesman said . \nCanadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper said Canada is sending CF-18 fighter jets to join a Canadian warship on standby off the coast of Libya . \nThe Pentagon , meanwhile , announced Friday that Defense Secretary Robert Gates will travel to Russia this weekend as the United States and other nations deliberate action against Libya . \n`` There is no consideration being given to delaying this trip , '' spokesman Geoff Morrell said at the Pentagon . \nHe said Gates maintains constant communications links with Washington wherever he goes and can `` carry out his responsibilities no matter where he is in the world . '' \nAsked whether the cease-fire declaration complicates a U.N.-sanctioned intervention , Michael Rubin , a Middle East expert at the American Enterprise Institute , said , `` It is going to make it tougher without a doubt . '' \n`` One should credit Obama for getting the international community behind him , but it came at the price of momentum . \nThe Libyans understand European weakness and know how to play off of it , '' Rubin said . \nRubin said migration concerns come into play , with Europeans worried that more violence will generate more refugees . \n`` They look at change in North Africa almost exclusively through the lens of migration , '' he said . \nThe council voted 10-0 with five abstentions Thursday night to authorize `` states to take all necessary measures to protect civilians . '' \nIt also imposed a no-fly zone , banning all flights in Libyan airspace , with exceptions that involve humanitarian aid and evacuation of foreign nationals . \nThe United States and its NATO partners have severalcontingencies in place to act quickly , according to an administration official familiar with planning . \nThey include airstrikes and cruise missile attacks designed to cripple Libyan air defenses and punish the military units that are leading Gadhafi 's push on opposition strongholds in the east , the official said . \nThe opposition , with devoted but largely untrained and under-equipped units , has suffered military setbacks this week . \nBut their hopes were buoyed by the U.N. vote , particularly in rebel-held Benghazi , where an assault by pro-Gadhafi forces has been expected . \nThe resolution singles out the city . \nIt says U.N. member states can `` take all necessary measures ... to protect civilians and civilian populated areas under threat of attack in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya , including Benghazi , while excluding a foreign occupation force . \n`` The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya '' is a formal name for the nation . \nCNN 's Richard Roth , Arwa Damon , Nic Robertson , Tommy Evans , Elise Labott , Al Goodman , John King , Alan Silverleib , Raja Razek , Jennifer Rizzo , Joe Vaccarello , Yousuf Basil and Reza Sayah , and journalist Mohamed Fadel Fahmy contributed to this report . \n"}
{"id": "145", "time": "2011-03-19", "text": "March 19 , 2011 | By Jason Hanna , CNN The destroyer USS Stout launches a Tomahawk missile toward a target on Libya 's coast on Saturday . \nAn international military coalition including France , the United States and Great Britain attacked Libyan air-defense and other military targets Saturday night in an operation that eventually will include enforcing a no-fly zone . \nLibyan rebels had called on international action to help them stave off assaults by Libyan government forces on their positions in Benghazi and other enclaves . \nThe coalition 's intervention in Libya 's civil war comes two days after the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution authorizing the use of force , including a no-fly zone , to `` protect civilians and civilian populated areas '' from government attack . \nHere is a look at how the situation got to this point , and what the major players are saying and doing . \nTHE START OF THE CONFLICT Libya 's civil war began last month , following protests that coincided with a larger wave of demonstrations in North Africa and the Middle East against governments there . \nIn Libya , protesters rallied against , among other things , high unemployment and a delay in a government housing project , and they eventually called for democracy and an end to Moammar Gadhafi 's almost 42-year-long rule . \nClashes between protesters and security forces began in Benghazi -- Libya 's second-largest city -- on February 16 , and as violence spread to other cities , opposition forces claimed control of Benghazi and other parts of eastern Libya . \nIn the ensuing days , the opposition and external governments accused the Libyan regime of atrocities and rights violations , including allegations of a military helicopter firing on a crowd in Benghazi , other military attacks against civilians , arbitrary detentions and summary executions . \nGadhafi 's regime responded that it was attacking al Qaeda , not civilians . \nGADHAFI 'S FORCES GAIN GROUND AGAINST REBELS At the beginning of March , the Libyan military stepped up efforts to reclaim areas lost to rebels . \nPro-Gadhafi forces marched eastward , hammering rebel positions in north-central Libya 's Ras Lanuf by the end of last week and moving on to al-Brega and Ajdabiya . \nBy the end of this week , Gadhafi 's forces were poised to strike Benghazi . \nARAB LEAGUE REQUESTS NO-FLY ZONE ; U.N. COMPLIES While the rebels pleaded for help , late last week , the Arab League voted to ask the United Nations Security Council to impose a no-fly zone over Libya to `` protect the civilian population , '' league Secretary General Amre Moussa said . \n"}
{"id": "381", "time": "2011-03-19", "text": "Explosions , gunfire heard overnight in Tripoli Gadhafi supporters rally in Tripoli Gadhafi vows to counter `` naked aggression '' Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Explosions and anti-aircraft fire thundered in the skies above Tripoli early Sunday , but it was not clear whether they resulted from another round of cruise missile attacks by allies determined to stop Moammar Gadhafi 's offensive against Libyan opposition forces . \nCNN 's Nic Robertson witnessed the development a few hours after nearly 1,000 people gathered at Gadhafi 's palace in the capital . \nThe crowd chanted , waved flags and shot off fireworks in support of the government . \nA defiant Gadhafi said Libya will fight back against undeserved `` naked aggression . '' \nHis military claimed nearly 50 people , including , women , children and clerics , were killed in Saturday evening 's attacks . \nThere was no independent confirmation of that statement . \nAmerican , French and British military forces , convinced that Gadhafi was not adhering to a United Nations-mandated cease-fire , hammered Libyan military positions with missiles and fighter jets in the first phase of an operation that will include enforcement of a no-fly zone . \nGadhafi responds to air strikes Gallery : Civil war in Libya An eyewitness in Tripoli reported seeing signs of gunfire rising Sunday morning from the direction of nearby Mitiga Airport . \nThe anti-Gadhafi activist said she heard `` continuous gunshots '' and at least two loud explosions . \nIt was not clear if the airport was also being used as a military installation . \nThe eyewitness , who was not identified for security reasons , said she did not hear the sound of flying aircraft . \nMore than 110 Tomahawk missiles fired from American and British ships and submarines hit about 20 Libyan air and missile defense targets in western portions of the country , U.S. Vice Adm. William Gortney said at a Pentagon briefing . \nThe U.S. will conduct a damage assessment of the sites , which include SA-5 missiles and communications facilities . \nA senior U.S. military official , who was not authorized to speak on the record , said the cruise missiles , which fly close to the ground or sea at about 550 miles per hour , landed near Misrata and Tripoli . \nThe salvo , in an operation dubbed `` Odyssey Dawn , '' was meant `` to deny the Libyan regime from using force against its own people , '' said Gortney . \nU.S. Navy photos showed flashes of light and smoke funnels as missiles soared from a destroyer into the night sky . \nEarlier , French fighter jets deployed over Libya fired at a military vehicle Saturday , the first strike against Gadhafi 's military forces , which earlier attacked the rebel stronghold of Benghazi . \nPrime Minister David Cameron said late Saturday that British forces also are in action over Libya . \n`` What we are doing is necessary , it is legal and it is right , '' he said . \n`` I believe we should not stand aside while this dictator murders his own people . '' \nBritish Defense Secretary Liam Fox said the Royal Air Force deployed Tornado GR4 fast jets , which flew 3,000 miles from the United Kingdom and back , `` making this the longest-range bombing mission conducted by the RAF since the -LRB- 1982 -RRB- Falklands conflict . '' \nWhile there were no U.S. warplanes flying over Libya late Saturday , the coalition was softening Libyan positions before enforcing a no-fly zone , Gortney said . \nThe Libyan military , in a statement broadcast on state TV , said , `` An enemy attacked the state on March 19th with rockets ... Those enemies killed 48 martyrs -- mostly women , children , and religious clerics . \nThey left more than 150 injured . \nThe majority of these attacks were on public areas , hospitals and schools . \nThey frightened the children and women near those areas that were subject to this aggression . '' \nLibya forces advance on main rebel base Gadhafi , speaking early Sunday on Libyan state TV , said the U.N. charter provides for Libya 's right to defend itself in a `` war zone . '' \nWeapons depots will be opened , he said . \n`` All you people of the Islamic nations and Africa , and Latin America and Asia , stand with the Libyan people in its fight against this aggression , '' Gadhafi said . \nAir attacks on several locations in Tripoli and Misrata have caused `` real harm '' to civilians , a Libyan government spokesman said . \nAn eyewitness in Misrata said Gadhafi 's forces are targeting fuel and power stations in an effort to make citizens believe the damage is being done by coalition forces . \nThe eyewitness , who was not identified for security reasons , said people celebrated allied airstrikes on loyalist positions in the city . \nCNN could not verify the account . \nShortly after the first missile attacks , U.S. President Barack Obama informed the American people of the efforts by a `` broad coalition . '' \n`` The use of force is not our first choice , '' the president said from Brasilia , Brazil . \n`` It is not a choice I make lightly . \nBut we can not stand idly by when a tyrant tells his own people that there will be no mercy . '' \nObama is planning for the U.S. portion of the military action in Libya to only last for a few days , according to a senior administration official , who was not authorized to speak about sensitive military matters . \n`` After that we 'll take more of a supporting role , '' the senior official said . \nObama authorized U.S. military force from Brazil on what happened to be the eighth anniversary of the start of the war in Iraq . \nCoalition partners say Gadhafi has failed to adhere to a United Nations resolution that imposed the no-fly zone and ordered him to stop attacks on civilians . \n`` He 's clearly been on the offensive , '' the senior U.S. military official said of Gadhafi . \n`` He said that he was going to do a cease-fire and he continued to move his forces into Benghazi . '' \nEarlier Saturday , Gadhafi issued defiant messages to international powers . \n`` I have all the Libyan people with me and I 'm prepared to die . \nAnd they are prepared to die for me . \nMen , women and even children , '' Gadhafi said in a letter addressed to Obama and read to reporters by a government spokesman in Tripoli . \nObama , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Gortney used the term `` unique capabilities '' to describe the U.S. part of the effort . \nOfficials have said American military forces are meant to augment Arab , European and other Western troops . \nIn the next few days , U.S. military officials expect to hand over control to a coalition commander . \nCanada and Italy also are part of the coalition . \n`` Our air force will oppose any aggression by Colonel Gadhafi against the population of Benghazi , '' said French President Nicolas Sarkozy , speaking after a top-level meeting in Paris over the Libyan crisis . \nThe international meeting -- which included Western and Arab partners -- focused on how to take on a Libyan government bent on destroying the fledgling opposition movement under the U.N. resolution authorizing force to protect civilians against the Gadhafi government . \nRebel forces in Benghazi used a captured army tank as a victory symbol , CNN 's Arwa Damon reported . \nEarlier Saturday , incoming artillery rounds landed inside Benghazi , and pro-Gadhafi tanks rolled into the town firing rounds , witnesses said . \nA flaming fighter jet plummeted from the sky , nose-diving to the ground . \nKhaled el-Sayeh , the opposition military spokesman , said the plane was an old MiG-23 that belonged to the rebels . \nAs night fell over Benghazi on Saturday , the city became quiet and calm . \nWhile plumes of smoke could be spotted , the pro-Gadhafi tanks seen earlier were not in sight . \nEl-Sayeh told CNN that `` tens '' had been killed in Benghazi on Saturday . \nHe said Gadhafi forces had withdrawn from the city and that they were positioned 50 kilometers -LRB- 31 miles -RRB- outside Benghazi . \nCNN could not independently verify those details . \nGadhafi -- in a separate letter addressed to Sarkozy , Cameron and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon -- called the U.N. moves `` invalid '' because the resolution does not permit intervention in the internal affairs of other countries . \nViolence has raged in Libya following protests calling for democracy and freedom and demanding an end to Gadhafi 's almost 42-year-long rule . \nIt 's a conflict spurred by anti-government protest and resulting regime violence against civilians -- which the U.N. resolution cites as `` outrageous '' and Sarkozy calls `` murderous madness .

{"id": "181", "time": "2011-07-16", "text": "BENGHAZI Middle Eastern autocrats routinely warn their people of rivers of blood , Western occupation , poverty , chaos , and Al Qaeda if their regimes are toppled . \nThose threats were heard in Tunisia , Egypt , Yemen , Bahrain , Syria , and rendered in black-comedy style in Libya . \nBut there is a strong belief across the region that the costs of removing autocracies , as high as they might be , are low compared to the damage inflicted by the current rulers . \nIn short , freedom is worth the price . \nIn Libya , four scenarios may negatively affect prospects for democratization : civil\\/tribal war , military rule , becoming stuck in transition , and partition . \nGiven the high price Libyans have paid , those scenarios should be prevented rather than cured . \nThe civil\\/tribal war scenario is the worst risk . \nEgypt s revolutionaries understood this . \nWhen sectarian violence erupted there following the removal of Hosni Mubarak , the revolutionary coalitions adopted the slogan , You won t gloat over this , Mubarak . \nRepressive dictatorships can not win free and fair elections . \nBut they can use extreme violence to consolidate their control over the state , its people and its institutions . \nSo , to win , Libya s Colonel Moammar Gadhafi has deliberately and successfully turned a civil-resistance campaign into an armed conflict . \nThat will have ramifications in the post-authoritarian context . \nA study published by Columbia University on civil resistance has shown that the probability of a country relapsing into civil war following a successful anti-dictatorship armed campaign is 43 % , versus 28 % when the campaign is unarmed . \nAccording to the same study , which was based on 323 cases of armed and unarmed opposition campaigns between 1900 and 2006 , the likelihood of democratic transition within five years following a successful armed opposition campaign is only 3 % , compared to 51 % when campaigns were unarmed . \nLibya , of course , can survive the gloomy prospect of post-authoritarian civil war . \nBut this requires containing tribal and regional polarization , as well as the rivalries between the Interim National Council -LRB- INC -RRB- and the Military Council -LRB- MC -RRB- , and between senior military commanders . \nViolent polarization has developed not only between Eastern and Western tribes , but also between some of the Western tribes . \nLast month , for example , armed clashes erupted between rebels in al-Zintan and the villagers of al-Rayyaniya , 15 kilometers away . \nSix people were killed a reminder of what can happen if violent polarization continues between neighboring towns and villages . \nVendetta politics is not unknown in Libya , and , in an armed society comprising more than 120 tribes including around 30 with significant numbers and resources it can become extremely dangerous . \nAnother negative scenario is military rule . \nSeveral figures from the free officers the group that plotted the 1969 coup against the monarchy are leading the INC. . \nThey include General Abd al-Fattah Younis , General Soliman Mahmoud , Colonel Khalifa Haftar , Major Mohamed Najm , and others . \nThose figures hold a mix of historical legitimacy , for participating in the 1969 coup , and current legitimacy , for helping the 17th February revolution . \nThey also belong to several large tribes , guaranteeing wide tribal representation if a military council were to take power , as in Egypt . \nUnlike Egypt , however , whoever takes power in Libya will not necessarily inherit poor economic conditions that could threaten their legitimacy and undermine their popularity . \nThis might lead a group of senior officers to rule directly , especially if victory in Libya comes militarily . \nA move by army officers in Tripoli against Gadhafi and his sons might end the conflict , with military commanders getting the credit and the political capital . \nBut four decades of military-based dictatorship may be enough for Libyans , a majority of whom never really benefited from their country s wealth or potential . \nWhen it comes to producing terrorists and undocumented immigrants two critical issues for Europe Arab military dictators have an inglorious record . \nAlgeria in the 1990 s is a potent reminder of this , and Western governments do not want the vicious cycle of repressive autocrats producing violent theocrats and refugees to restart . \nGetting `` stuck in transition '' Getting stuck in transition is a third possible scenario , with Libya remaining in a gray zone neither a fully-fledged democracy nor a dictatorship , but semi-free . \nThis means regular elections , a democratic constitution , and civil society , coupled with electoral fraud , skewed representation , human rights violations , and restrictions on civil liberties . \nGetting stuck in transition usually kills the momentum for democratic change , and widespread corruption , weak state institutions , and lack of security serve to reinforce a myth of the just autocrat . \nVladimir Putin s rule in Russia illustrates this outcome . \nUnfortunately , a study published in the Journal of Democracy showed that out of the 100 countries that were designated in transition between 1970 and 2000 , only 20 became fully democratic -LRB- for example , Chile , Argentina , Poland , and Taiwan -RRB- . \nFive relapsed into brutal dictatorships -LRB- including Uzbekistan , Algeria , Turkmenistan , and Belarus -RRB- , while the rest were stuck somewhere in transition . \nGiven Libya s lack of democratic experience , some view this as a likely outcome in the post-Gadhafi era . \nBut Libya is not the only country that has tried to move from dictatorship to democracy with weak institutions and strong tribal identities . \nAlbania , Mongolia , and India successfully passed more complicated tests and offer some useful lessons in democratic transitions under unfavourable conditions . \nThe fourth scenario is partition , with the old three-province , Ottoman-style setup commonly mentioned : Cyrenaica -LRB- east -RRB- , Fezzan -LRB- south -RRB- , and Tripolitania -LRB- west -RRB- . \nCyrenaica is Gadhafi-free , Tripolitania is not , and Fezzan did not fully join the revolution . \nBut the administrative borders of these districts were never fully established , and they have changed at least eight times since 1951 . \nIn 2007 , Libya had 22 sha biya -LRB- administrative districts -RRB- , not three . \nAll of these scenarios will be affected by outcomes in Egypt and Tunisia . \nIn the case of democratic transitions , a success nearby often helps at home . \nEither country , or both , could offer Libya successful transition models , erecting an important obstacle to military dictatorship or civil war . \nThe views expressed in this article are solely those of Omar Ashour . \nwww.project-syndicate.org The above may be quite true in Yemen and in fact , is but in Libya it 's a different story . \nWhat the people in the right-wing news media wo n't and never will talk about is the way Mohammar Qadaffy greatly helped the Libyan people after the 1969 revolution . \nFor instance , the litteracy rate in Libya was 15 % in 1970 and today is 85 % while the poor gradually became less poor and hospitals , bridges and schools were built which otherwise would not have happened under King Idris . \nIf the `` rebels '' triumph there with the help of NATO , Libya will only

{"id": "150", "time": "2011-07-16", "text": "U.S. recognizes Libyan rebels ' authority By the CNN Wire Staff U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton after a press conference at the meeting of the Libya Contact Group in Istanbul Friday . \nHe says he 's wildly popular in Libya and derides `` traitors '' Hillary Clinton states the new policy at Libya Contact Group meeting in Turkey The Transitional National Council is a main organization for the opposition Istanbul -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The United States now recognizes the main opposition group in Libya `` as the legitimate governing authority '' in a country that Moammar Gadhafi has long ruled with an iron first , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Friday . \nU.S. recognition of the Transitional National Council is a major diplomatic policy shift that could give the rebels access to Libyan regime assets that have been frozen by the United States . \nClinton announced the change in Istanbul at a meeting of the Libya Contact Group , the alliance of nations working to deal with the Libyan crisis . \nApplause rippled through the audience as she spoke . \nClinton said the Transitional National Council , also known as the TNC , `` continues to gain legitimacy as the representative of the Libyan people '' and conducts `` high-level diplomacy with governments worldwide . '' \n`` So I am announcing today that , until an interim authority is in place , the United States will recognize the TNC as the legitimate governing authority for Libya , and we will deal with it on that basis . '' \nThe United States had previously stopped short of giving this recognition to the council , but Clinton said the body , based in Benghazi , Libya , `` has offered important assurances today . '' \nThey include `` the promise to pursue a process of democratic reform that is inclusive both geographically and politically , to uphold Libya 's international obligations and to disburse funds in a transparent manner to address the humanitarian and other needs of the Libyan people . '' \nThe United States `` appreciates these assurances from the TNC , which reinforce our confidence that it is the appropriate interlocutor for us in dealing with Libya 's present and addressing Libya 's future . '' \nIn Zintan , rebel military commander Hajj Ousama Jwaili , a commander in the western mountains , said Friday that he considers the announcement `` another indication of support by the international community toward the rebel fighters . '' \nHe added , `` This is an appreciated move by the U.S. , and more countries should do the same . '' \nGadhafi reacted with derision to the U.S. announcement . \n`` Their decisions , meetings , recognitions and their statements are all under your feet -- trample on them , '' he said Friday in an audio message , purportedly taped in Zlitan and broadcast on state-run television . \n`` This is our answer to all the decisions they took against the Libyan people . '' \nThe Libyan leader urged the NATO powers and others to take heed of what he said was his continuing popularity in Libya . \n`` You in America , Europe , Russia and everywhere , look ! \nLook at the millions . \nLook at the Libyan people . \nMore than 5 million people carrying the pictures of Gadhafi are ready for jihad and for martyrdom . '' \nHe called for `` traitors '' to give up their effort to overthrow his regime , warning that failure to comply will have consequences . \n`` They must abandon their weapons and turn themselves in from Benghazi to Misrata to Zintan , '' he said . \n`` We will not hold anyone who turns in his weapons accountable . \nIf this does not happen , the march of millions will take place . '' \nThe Libyan uprising began in February , when opposition forces began fighting to oust Gadhafi and his regime . \nNATO forces have been operating under a U.N. mandate in Libya to protect people from aggression by Gadhafi forces . \nClinton said the United States `` will help the TNC sustain its commitment to the sovereignty , independence , territorial integrity and national unity of Libya , and we will look to it to remain steadfast in its commitment to human rights and fundamental freedoms . '' \n`` In contrast , the United States views the Gadhafi regime as no longer having any legitimate authority in Libya , '' she said . \nDiplomatic efforts have been ongoing to end the crisis , and Clinton said Libyans are `` looking past Gadhafi . '' \n`` They know , as we all know , that it is no longer a question of whether Gadhafi will leave power but when . '' \nClinton said the coalition will continue to target Gadhafi 's command and control if he keeps threatening the citizenry . \n`` The terms of a cease-fire are clear . \nGadhafi must stop attacks or the threat of attacks , remove his troops from all of the places they have forcibly entered and facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance . \n`` The terms of a political process that will produce a cease-fire and pave the way to a democratic Libya are also clear . \nIt must involve Gadhafi 's departure and an inclusive effort to build a new constitutional framework that redeems the democratic aspirations of all the Libyan people . '' \nAs for the recognition step , a senior State Department official reiterated that the rebel council 's political and economic assurances `` turned the tide '' in their favor . \n`` We sent a very clear signal ... to the TNC that we recognize them as the future of Libya , '' State Department spokesman Mark Toner said . \n`` As such , we 're going to take steps to make sure that they 're able to carry out their functions . '' \nA final statement issued by the Contact Group raised a range of points , including an agreement by the participants `` to deal '' with the Transitional National Council `` as the legitimate governing authority '' in the country `` until an interim authority is in place . '' \nIt also welcomed monetary pledges and encouraged financial help . \n`` Noting that the unfolding situation in Libya since mid-February has disrupted the operations of foreign companies and contractors , the Contact Group welcomed the commitment of the -LRB- Transitional National Council -RRB- to open up Libya to foreign investment as soon as possible and its commitment to honor any existing legal contracts signed under the Gadhafi regime , '' it said . \nIt also cited `` the need for establishment of a genuine cease-fire and provision of safe humanitarian access remain as urgent as ever . '' \nThe group `` urged all relevant parties to explore ways and means of paving the way for the formation of an interim government to ensure a smooth and peaceful transition of power with the widest popular support possible , '' it said . \nCNN 's Elise Labott and Kareem Khadder contributed to this report . \n"}

'' \nLibyan dragged away after rape claim Rebels take back critical Libyan city CNN could not independently verify al-Obeidy 's story but her injuries appeared consistent with what she said . \nGovernment officials quickly closed in to stifle her . \nBut she persisted , wanting the journalists , staying at the Rixos Hotel , to see Gadhafi 's brutality firsthand . \nInternational journalists , including CNN 's staff , are not allowed to move freely in the Libyan capital and are escorted out of the hotel only on organized outings by government minders . \nThis was the first time a Libyan opposed to Gadhafi attempted to independently approach the journalists here . \nWhat followed was a disturbing scene of how Gadhafi 's government operates . \nSecurity forces moved to subdue the woman . \nEven a member of the hotel 's kitchen staff drew a knife . \nhe shouted at her in contempt . \nAnother staffer tried to put a dark tablecloth over her head . \nOne government official , who was there to facilitate access for journalists , pulled a pistol from his belt . \nOthers scuffled with the journalists , manhandling them to the ground in an attempt to wrestle away their equipment . \nSome journalists were beaten and kicked . \nCNN 's camera was confiscated and deliberately smashed beyond repair . \nSecurity men said al-Obeidy was `` mentally ill '' and was being taken to a `` hospital . '' \nThey dragged her unceremoniously to a waiting white car . \n`` If you do n't see me tomorrow , than that 's it , '' she yelled . \nThe journalists believed al-Obeidy 's life to be in danger , and several of them demanded to see her . \nAt a news conference later , they challenged Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim on what they had experienced . \nKaim told them that authorities were investigating the incident . \n`` We will let you know , '' he said . \nLater , a government spokesman said al-Obeidy was `` safe '' and `` doing well . '' \nHe said her case was a criminal one -- not political -- and that she has been offered legal aid . \nOfficials later said the woman was sane and would bring criminal charges against her attackers . \nJournalists would be able to see her , they added . \nBut his assurances did little to assure the journalists who had witnessed Gadhafi 's firm and pervasive grip on Libyan society . \nA woman who dared to speak against him was quickly silenced . \nJournalists who dared to tell her story paid a price . \nIt was one tale that perhaps went a long way in illuminating the need to protect Libya 's people . \nCNN 's Nic Robertson and Khalil Abdallah contributed to this report . \n"}
{"id": "187", "time": "2011-03-26", "text": "By the CNN Wire Staff Explosion in Tripoli ; plane heard `` Winds of change are starting to blow , '' opposition says Rebel forces took control of Ajdabiya overnight Ajdabiya , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The retreat of Moammar Gadhafi 's forces from a key eastern city Saturday reinvigorated the opposition , which began taking the fight west toward the capital of Tripoli . \nBy Saturday evening , advancing opposition fighters had reached the outskirts of the city of Brega , to the west of Ajdabiya , said opposition spokesman Col. Ahmed Omar Bani . \n`` The winds of change are starting to blow , '' Bani told reporters in Benghazi . \nGadhafi 's troops fell back after days of fierce fighting in Ajdabiya , Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim told reporters . \nHe said the coalition 's airstrike attacks were direct and the Libyan military decided to withdraw . \nThat air campaign continued Saturday , further limiting loyalist movements . \nFrench warplanes destroyed at least five Libyan combat planes and two helicopters over a 24-hour period , the Ministry of Defense said . \nRebels take back critical Libyan city Libya 's civil war making families homeless Meanwhile , an especially loud explosion and the subsequent sound of a plane , most likely belonging to the allies , were heard late Saturday in Tripoli , but there was no anti-aircraft fire in response . \nAfter the fall of Ajdabiya , the fighting is sure to shift westward through cities and towns that are more loyal to Gadhafi . \nJalal al-Gallal , another spokesman , said the opposition expects heavy resistance in towns like Sirte , Gadhafi 's birthplace , where he has strong support . \nGadhafi 's forces resumed shelling Misrata , just two hours east of Tripoli , where some of the most intense fighting has taken place since protests erupted in Libya last month . \nA witness told CNN that Gadhafi troops randomly targeted buildings and people in Misrata . \nAnother witness said he saw busloads of loyalist snipers being brought to the city . \nCNN could not independently verify those accounts . \nOfficials have said Gadhafi is far from defeated and still retains the power to reinforce units . \nOpposition fighters chanted gratitude for the coalition 's support after they wrested control of Ajdabiya , considered a gateway to Libya 's vast oil fields and a stopping point en route to the rebel stronghold of Benghazi . \nThey were confident that with protective air power they would be able to hold onto the city they had captured once before but lost to Gadhafi 's army . \nAjdabiya is now `` 100 percent '' in opposition hands , said Shamsuldin Abed Mawlah , spokesman for Libya 's opposition interim council . \nHe said many loyalists were retreating westward . \nOvernight , international fighter jets again bombed Libyan tanks that have been entrenched at the city 's northern and western gates for days , said al-Gallal . \nAt the northern entrance , damaged tanks lay strewn across the rolling desert . \nThe buildings around the city entrances were riddled with bullet holes . \nRebel troops combed the city 's streets Saturday , hunting for any remaining Gadhafi loyalists as some displaced residents trickled back to their homes . \nThe Ajdabiya victory is viewed as significant for the opposition . \nIt also served as evidence of the impact of coalition airstrikes as NATO prepares to take command of the Libya mission this weekend . \nCoalition airstrikes targeted Gadhafi 's military on the outskirts of Misrata but tanks resumed shelling Saturday , a doctor at the main hospital told CNN . \nOpposition fighters , armed only with light weapons , were trying to repel the attack and casualties were mounting , he said . \nAt least 20 people were wounded in Misrata , victims of snipers taking aim in the heart of the city , said the doctor , who was not identified for safety reasons . \nFriday , seven people were killed and another 70 were wounded . \nAl-Gallal said the next big battle will be for control of Misrata . \n`` He -LRB- Gadhafi -RRB- is scared about Misrata , '' al-Gallal said . \n`` It 's too close to Tripoli . \nHe 's going to do everything he can to hold on to it . '' \nOpposition leaders uploaded a video that showed a rooftop view of Misrata . \nGunfire could be heard and puffs of smoke rose from at least one rooftop , possibly indicating a sniper . \nCNN could not verify the contents of the video . \nCoalition planes flew 164 sorties Friday in Operation Odyssey Dawn and coalition leaders reported damage to Gadhafi 's ground forces . \n`` Coalition forces have targeted anti-air capabilities , tanks , armored vehicles , as well as other regime forces threatening the civilians throughout the country , '' said Capt. Clint Gebke , a coalition spokesman . \nU.S. President Barack Obama defended America 's leadership in the international coalition in his weekly radio address Saturday . \n`` Make no mistake , '' Obama said , `` because we acted quickly , a humanitarian catastrophe has been avoided and the lives of countless civilians -- innocent men , women and children -- have been saved . '' \n`` The United States should not -- and can not -- intervene every time there 's a crisis somewhere in the world , '' Obama said . \n`` But I firmly believe that when innocent people are being brutalized ; when someone like Gadhafi threatens a bloodbath that could destabilize an entire region ; and when the international community is prepared to come together to save many thousands of lives -- then it 's in our national interest to act . \nAnd it 's our responsibility . \nThis is one of those times .

'' \nLibya could have great future ... Marco Vicenzino , chief strategy adviser at the Afghanistan World Foundation , said the future for Libya could be bright if its wealth was fairly distributed . \n`` What happens next very much depends on whether Gadhafi survives or how long he fights to survive and that could be a long time . \n"}

Anyway , This looks like a new movement among young populations across mideast . \nU.S. should embrace this , let people stand for themselves , and minimize U.S. contribution to resolve conflict . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 10:13 am | March 21 , 2011 at 10:14 am | The US has a critical role to play in sprading freedom across the world not only in Libya . \nHistory wouldnt have forgiven the US if it didnt take the lead . \nAm proud of the US leadership . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 10:20 am | was n't the idea to get rid of Libya 's leader ? \nIf so then who cares whether he was targeted or not ? \nCut off the head of the snake and they will have accomplished what all the countries set out to do ... If Kadhafi was dead then civilian deaths would stop ... No Kadhafi ... No countless deaths of Liabya 's people . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 12:04 pm | Libya is revolting against Gadhafi , this clearly is a strife between people of that country . \nThe rebels asked for help and assistance to the West , and the west very much obliged . \nNow , Obama said we will not be heading the alliance , and yet the cruise missiles that rained in Libya were fired from US warships . \nHow much money did the US have to spend once more for those missiles ? \nOne more reason this country is going broke each day . \nPlus Libya is no friend of the US , now the rebels need help and they are friendly , once this civil war is over , it will be back to the old ways . \nClearly , these countries are bunch of ingrates and back stabbers . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 12:10 pm | Germans scooped photos of our military men in Afghanistan posing with mutilated corpses . \nHow is it possible that our US news media was scooped , or are they just not allowed to report misdeeds of our troops ? \nI think our men have been in combat too long to be so inhumane . \nI dont blame Afghanistan for wanting the US troops to leave . \nIs this what is planned in Libya ? \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 12:10 pm | So who will be next ? \nWill it be Yemen , Syria , Tunisia that the US will be raining down cruise missiles ? \nAnd who will be paying for those missiles ? \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 12:14 pm | What are they going to impeach him for ? \nHe is not declaring war . \nHe is actually not even doing anything as bad as Bush did in Iraq . \nObama is agreeing with the rest of the world that something needs to be done to stop the slaughter in Libya . \nBush laughed at the rest of the world and said `` screw you , i am going to do what i want anyway ! '' \nThey never declared war then either . \nIt was just called a military operation . \nMy husband is in the army and got to fight in that `` operation . '' \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 12:20 pm | . \nIf these countries are in the middle of a revolution , more power to them . \nBut it is not any of our business . \nThen you can argue that if we do not help then it could become another world war before we decide to intervene . \nHard to decide what to do . \nHelp other human beings or just sit back and watch them get slaughtered ? \nThe people of Libya have asked the world for help . \nThe people in Iraq did not want us anywhere near them . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 12:28 pm | I see no conflict in President Obama 's comments : He says the official US position is that Gaddafi must step down as Libya 's leader , but it will not use military force to achieve that end . \nHe say the US WILL use military force to protect Libyan civilians from Gadaffi 's military attacks . \nBe that as it may , I feel the US needs to step back from it 's self-appointed role as the world 's police agency . \nI hate the idea of ANY government subjugating people , but neither do I feel responsible to prevent it . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 12:35 pm | Please Tell me Why this country did NOT go into Libyia Sooner . \nHow many Years has The leader been a Sore in the US side ? \nWish the Arab League would make up their minds what they are going to do . \nThe Arab League has Always been Flakely . \nThe Leader needs to Disappear . \nI Approve of this very much . \nHow much information does the Public really need ? \nI believe while there they should also take out Iran . \nEspecially after holding Hostages for about 444 days . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 12:50 pm | Yes we should be there , I just wish the UN could have been there earlier . \nEveryone talked and talked and dragged their feet for a month and now people , politicians and the News media are all acting confused as to what is going on . \nTo me it is pretty obvious what is going on so I do not understand others acting so confused and critical . \nThe UN should have been in there earlier when it would have been easier to achieve their goal and hundreds if not thousands would not have had to die . \nEveryone is demanding too much information and wanting Psychic knowledge of how and when it will end . \nCommon sense says you do n't tell the enemy where you will be and what you are going to do ahead of time which is what people are demanding to know . \nGrow Up and pay attention and you will know what is going on . \nBe happy we live in a country that will not sit back and watch while people are being slaughtered for asking for what you already have . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 12:51 pm | how come we are so worried bout libya killing themselves . \nI mean look at the USA we kill each other for a dollar . \nhow bout we start worring bout ourselves and not wat going on over seas and how come its the USA and UK that always step in ? \nthe U.N needs to step up and deal with it USA has enough probs of our own . \nwe dont need to worry bout out them we should worry bout makein jobs for ppl who dont have jobs . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 12:56 pm | do people not know if we go to war oil will go up gas will go up i say we worry bout the USA and the USA only March 21 , 2011 at 1:10 pm | I think we have WAY too irons in fire right now and are spreading our already stressed military too thin !!!! I feel for the people in Libya ... but this type of action should have happened many , many years ago ... and I do not trust our governments motives behind this decision ! \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 1:11 pm | America has no business in Libya just like they have no business in the Middle East . \nI 'm sick of America being the world police . \nThe worst part about it is that Libyans EXPECTED the U.S. to come do something . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 1:11 pm | We should be involved to a certain extent . \nwhat we have done so far I believe is good enough . \nWe can not continue spending money on the military when we have still millions of people out of work who may beed federal extensions on their unemployment . \nIn addition , we are already dealing with a deficit in our economy . \nThis is no time to make it worse . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 1:12 pm | we are not the policemen of the world . \narabs took responsibility and are involved in protecting the people of libya from being slaughtered . \ntoo bad the world waited too long to do away with hilter to take down hilter . \nthe arabs should be commended for their involvement . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 1:13 pm | I think America must not get involve in Libya on a military level but perform the sergical operation or covert operation and take the Qadhafi and his son out of the equasion . \nWe do n't need to spend a dime because we are already in lots of debt . \nAlso we do not want to destroy any infrastructer of Libya that will impact on world economy . \nI feel sorry for the people of libya , but the U.S. has enoough of it 's own problems , We ca n't police the world , till we police America . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 1:15 pm | I am an active support of President Obama but his action in the Libyan theater is wrong . \nThe united States always seem to pray on weaker nations with oil under pretexts . \nPresident Obama , like former President Bush is killing Arab . \nPresident Obama is killing Libyan and destroying their country in the name of human right when we all know it is to militarily overthrow the Libyan government . \nI do not like Gadhafi because he was instrumental in destroying Liberia and killing over 250 Liberian but going after him with superior military might is wrong . \nThe U.S. could easily assassinate him instead . \nIf president Obama is serious about stopping foreign leaders from massacring their own people , why his administration is not in the Ivory Coast , Bahrain , and Yemen ? \nWhy the United States is not enforcing the countless United Nations Resolutions against Israel for it long atrocities against the Palestinians ? \nAs an independent voter Obama lost my vote for any attempts on his part for the presidency in 2012 . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 1:16 pm | The USA is broke and ca n't even support itself ... But it tries to make the public seem like the entity of the USA actually cares about people ... PLEASE . \nThe USA is a corporation that ca n't manage to sustain itself , it ` es going down under and is leaning off of the fed for perpetual debt ... it does n't take a genius to see where this is going . \nThe USA is in the exact financial situation that post WW2 German was in ... and now it seems they are going the EXACT same path to fix it . \nThey even have `` FEMA '' camps ... I do n't believe they will be able to suppress the civilian militia though should be interesting to watch . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 1:16 pm | I want us to help anyone\\/any nation in trouble and I do n't want this to come down to money . \nHowever , what about the need at home for education , housing , health care , etc. . \nIf we are going to continue to go into other countries to help them , let 's cut the military budget to the core in order to help those at home ! \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 1:16 pm | The situation concerning our involvement in Libya is ridiculous . \nFirst of all we are 2 weeks late in help the freedom fighters . \nNow we are trying to be so polically correct -LRB- the way our adminstration has been all year -RRB- , that it boggles the mind . \nEither we are in the war and want Kadafi gone or we should n't have started . \nWe now have the upper hand and instead of saying we are now backing off , -LRB- so dumb -RRB- , we should pursue Kadafi and his thugs until they give up or are blown up . \nAs far as the UN is concerned , they are worthless . \nIts time to stop worrying about what the world and every one thinks and get on with ending this revolt by really helping the opposition . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 1:16 pm | Playing a supportive role is the right thing to do . \nWe have to worry about Iraq and Afghanistan . \nLast time I checked Gaddafi is a horrible person , he is a dictator and like all dictators has killed thousands of his people for their beliefs and if he had put down this revolt , you could guarantee he would kill ten of thousands more . \nAlso in regards to the price , I was unaware that America 's foreign policy is `` we will help you , depending on how much it costs '' . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 1:17 pm | The president did it the right way . \nunlike George Bush he received the blessings of the UN . \nObama used his head and weighed all options . \nhe also made it clear there would be a limited offense with no boots on the ground . \nI ca n't believe all the criticism from the right when all they did was complain about the president doing nothing . \nFox news posted that Obama was suckered into the Libyan fight . \nIf anybody was suckered in it was George Bush with believing his own information he received on weapons of mass destruction . \nWe have no business in Libya . \nOur military industrial complex is an imperialist demon that is sucking this country dry . \nIt controls our congress and our president . \nWe have 1000 military bases in over 130 countries . \nThis is an imperialist takeover of the world to establish a one world government . \nThe American people are paying the price . \nWe finally have a President that has the forsight to look into the future before taking matters into his own hands . \nGoing through the U.N. and having a collective joint effort to stop the massacre in Libya was very smart and the best course of action for our country . \nYes , we should be there . . \nI also agree , the United States should not be the only country to absorb the cost or involvement . \nHowever , the process is too slow ... but diplomacy always is . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 1:20 pm | I believe the US should support the UN in handling these little wars . \nThe US has many internal problems . \nI fully support the way the Libyan problem is being handled . \nThe US is not the world 's policeman . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 1:20 pm | I think that everyone agrees that Gaddafi is a dictator and that he should go , but the UN should not be involved in internal affairs in this country . \nThe war at Lybia and the US leading the strikes is really confusing for any arab . \nOn the other hand , there are too many messages against arabs and muslims these days especially in CNN . \nCNN is watched in some Arab countries , so information about the strikes at Lybia and other programs like the '' unwelcome muslim next door '' may bring anger in the arab nations populations against US . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 1:23 pm | Please stop calling it a `` war against Libya '' or `` Libya War . '' \nIt 's a conflict . \nAnd it 's not USA battles Libya . \nIt 's UN resolution 1973 enforcement . \nPerception is reality to the audience that does not completely understand the nuances of the American language . \nThe foreign audience is watching as CNN presents the news to the world and in rural provinces that some people think CNN is the voice of the American government . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 1:23 pm | Seeing as how the rest of the world 's economy is directly or indirectly attached to our economy ... why do n't we concentrate on fixing OURS first . \nLet 's stop spreading our money around the world and take care of OUR problems now , and after that we can concentrate on helping others . \nOur priorities seemed to have been shuffeled around a bit . . \ndo n't you think . \nIs n't it about time the rest of the world take a more active part in their own economy instead of holding their hands out to us for help when we ca n't even take care of our own problems ? \nIt 's about time for us to handle our money more responsibly . \nI think the U.S. involvement in Libya is a noble thing . \nFor weeks you showed us how the Libian people rose up for in an effort to gain freedom from the tyriany in their homeland . \nYou planted journalists there and gave us reason to empathize with them and yearn for their freedom and a chance for democracy and to determine their own future . \nFinally , Obama and the U.N. coalition agree to go in and protect the opposition in Libya . \nNow all I hear from you on CNN is , `` How do the people in the U.S. feel about our participation in the military action in Libya ? '' \nWell , I think that most of us feel like we did before the action started , we want to help the Libyans . \nYour questions and the manner in which you ask them do not appear to be supportive . \nBefore the action began , you questioned why Obama was taking so long , now you 're questioning our actions . \nWe need to support our actions . \nAnd guess what - I 'm a Republican , but I think Obama has done a good job in handling this matter , along with Secretary of Defense Gates and Secretary of State Clinton . \nI have switched from watching Fox to CNN because of the fantastic coverage of the Egyptian situation , and I 've stayed here since . \nWolf Blitzer has far outdone the other channels with his Situation Room coverage on everything going on in the last two months . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 1:25 pm | We should provide backup support with our missiles and drones . \nBeing totally involve is another fiasco just like Iraq and Afghanistan . \nWe can not afford another war financially and in human terms . \nUnless the oppositions to Gadhafi on the ground request us and our Nato allies and the Arab league nations . \nRemember that we and our Nato allies are Infidels and another Infidel invasion of an Islamic nation does n't sit well with the Arabs . \nIt 's interesting that the Middle East conflicts are the result of fundamentalist -LRB- trouble makers -RRB- Muslims and always it 's the Infidels that has to come in and take care of the mess . \nWhy ca n't the peace loving Muslim band together and take care of the problems ? \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 1:30 pm | Ali Myself and members of my family voted for President Obama because we thought he was not going to follow in the footsteps of the previous administrarion . \nNeedless to say we are very disappointed that he has become a warmonger just like the man he replaced . \nIt is very strange that all black leaders are called dictators and efforts are made to remove them by the USA . \nThe USA just can not go around the world forcing governments to govern in a manner which the USA choses . \nIn addition why does this double standard in the middleeast continues . \nThe USA never support any UN resolutions that decree Israel for killing innocent Palestinians . \nAli we are very disgusted with the manner in which Obama has allowed the likes of Sen McCain and Liberman to dictate how he runs this country . \nHe definately will not get our vote and support when he mounts his campaign for reelection . \nI do hope Obama hear this message . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 1:36 pm | We should have been there weeks earlier ... but plowing through excruciating U.N. rules and getting a US and EU coalition to include Arab League participation was finally accomplished ... in the nick of time or ... too late ? \nOur obvious objective was to prevent the slaughter of anti-Gaddafi protesters . \nThese mostly young and idealistic Arabs were , perhaps , only hours away a Gaddafi promise of `` no mercy '' facing his army equiipped with overwhelming forces of tanks and heavy artillary , and a willingness to kill all protestors `` like rats . \nUnder the pressing need to stop a genocide , while trying to act legally , under U.N. rules , it looks like the good guys do n't have a tidy story , even as the three day war has been executed almost perfectly . \nSo now , the naysayers and Monday morning Q.B. 's seem to overlook the fact that we stopped a horrible slaughter of innocent protesters ... calling now for a `` full review '' and a `` definite end game '' . \nI wish we could call on the young Arab , Mohammed Nabburs , along with his two buddies -LRB- all slain by Gaddafi snipers -RRB- , , , to articulate the `` end game '' . \nAll they wanted was the freedom to live and work in a free country . \nIs that worth protecting ? \nIs that worth breaking a few asnine rules of engagement ? \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 1:42 pm | We are a leader in the world which espouses certain freedom as inherent rights of people and could not absolve ourselves from not supporting their effort of realizing same . \nIt would be unconscionable and an utter disgrace . \nwe should not be there , we didnt get into eghypt business why is it more important to play in lybia , i thought president obama was n't going to risk american lives when it is unneccessary , besides if the us really wanted him out we would have done it when we crossed his line of death back in the 80 's March 21 , 2011 at 1:53 pm | We still have n't learn to get along in this country . \nWhat if other countries stuck there nose in our business . \nWho is going to pay for all this . \nWe have thousands out of work . \nLocal governments are piling on taxes on property taxes for schools , state taxes to up . \nGovernment charged us for Social Security that some may never get and Federal Taxes ... who is going to pay for all of this . \nWe have the Democaates against the Repulicans and the Repulican agaisnt the Democrates and nothing here gets resolved . \nWe have children here going to be hungry , homeless people by the thousands and we ca n't resolve our own problems . \nWhy then do we think that we can resolve others . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 1:55 pm | I did not know my message was not appropriate ! \nIf so , please , do not publish it ! \nI was honest because I love the United States and I do n't like to see unintentional actions that may bring hatred against it . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 2:01 pm | From Canada : Having studied at college years ago with Libyan students , the day Ghadafi took over control of their country was still fresh in their minds . \nHe immediately declared all privately owned property belonging to the state and took over these properties and assets . \nThe people , relatively well off , were forced to give up everything and Ghadafi then doled minimal offerings out amongst the general population , limiting each family to one home , one servant , one car , etc. . \nMillions of dollars -LRB- at least -RRB- were taken from these people , and to this day many of them now live in squalor , any form of opulance doled out to Ghadafi 's personal circle of friends . \nI am pleased that Canada is helping to free these people , along with the other countries who have generously given in the name of humanity . \nLet 's hope this tyrant does n't get away with the monies taken from these people . \nI feel the involvement in another country is ridiculous and as a 20 year old college student fear there may be a draft at this pace in a few years . \nWe are just getting to involved these days . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 2:13 pm | This is an undeclared war . \nOur Constitution is the law of the land and requires a Congressional Declaration of War or at least the invocation of the War Powers Act . \nPrecedent save for Bush II and now Obama requires that we respond to attacks rather than initiate them and that we initiate only when there is a military threat to the US . \nLibya presents us with no justification for this attack . \nThe UN is acting like a bully and we are going along with it . \nGadhafi is doing exactly what any government would do if trying to put down a revolt within the borders of a soverign country . \nThe US and the UN have no legitimate interest in a Libyan civil war We should get out and apologize . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 2:15 pm | Our involvement inte no-fly zone is a huge waste of taxpayer money . \nWe have a humanitarian crisis in the US -- it 's called near 10 % unemployment and nationwide cuts in education . \nLet 's let France , the UK and the Arab League take care of this issue in their own back yard . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 2:16 pm | Yes , be involved . \nIf Misrata still exists , if any opposition Libyans are still alive can coalition forces do anything to protect them from pro-Gadhafi murder ? \nThe UN resolution clearly mandates protecting opposition Libyans from Gadhafi forces . \nI know Arab League nations are having problems with protest in their countries . \nEven so , Arab soldiers need to be sent to help Libyan protesters . \nMost Arab League nations very reasonably offerred dialogue to protesters . \nYou could offer mediation by an international panel of neutral countries as a next step in dialogue . \nA board of mediators might be Morocco , Uruguay , Indonesia , Switzerland , Madagascar , Iceland and , South Africa . \nThis way you responsibly address your people 's problems and Libya 's humanitarian need . \n-LRB- Gadhafi is killing Arabs . -RRB- \nYou win and win , at home and globally . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 2:16 pm | The coalition should go in , arrest Ghadafi and take him to the Hague for trial , period . \nI am a retired law professor and have taught Int ' l Law . \nIt would be legal-he is violating human rights . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 2:16 pm | What would the USA do if Libya decided it did not like how things in the USA were going ? \nDo all nations have the option to invade USA if they disapprove ? \nMiddle Eastern countries did not invade the USA during its civil war ? \nAs long as the Arabic world did not do anything -- why does the west interfere ? \nWe continue to look like agressors in the middle east . \nWhere is China & Russia . \nWhat are we doing ? \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 2:17 pm | Why are we now going into Libya ? \n-LRB- The same word that got us involved in every other Middle East operation -RRB- : OIL . \nLibya has one of the largest oil reserves in the world . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 2:17 pm | I am proud of the way the President handled this situation . \nThe Lybian people were begging for help . \nThe President managed to get NATO on board as well as the Arab League which is a major accomplishment . \nFirst the President was being critized for not going in soon enough , then he gets critized for going in at all . \nI am thankful that he is our President in the present state of the world . \nHe is someone who acts calmly and thinks before he acts . \nI shudder to think how a president McCain would have handled all that this President has had on his plate . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 2:17 pm | We should n't be helping ANY Libyans . \nThese are the same Libyans who welcomed home , as a hero , the Pan Am bomber . \nPick a side , any side , one 's as bad as another . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 2:17 pm | Yes I do believe we should be involved since UN regulations are not being followed and there strong evidence to suggest Human Rights violations . \nHowever I do not believe we should be there long term . \nWhile the president has not been as forth coming about the strategy for going to Librya . \nI believe members of congress , government officals need to stop bickering and get behind and support the soldiers . \nBad mouthing the presidents decisions and not offering constructive criticism is a waste of time . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 2:18 pm | This is completely ridiculous ! \nThere was no real need for America to get involved in this dispute in the Middle East . \nObama moved in too quickly and I feel this is a true disgrace to America . \nI think Obama should step down ... quite honestly ! \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 2:18 pm | France and Britain have interests in Libya , America does not . \nLet France and Britain take care of their own business without America 's help . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 2:18 pm | I 'm glad we 're involved in Libya . \nIt took a while , but our military capabilities will help in a way most other nations ca n't . \nI 'm proud that we 're there , but more than that , I 'm glad we do n't have to put boots on the ground . \nIn that way , we 're really appealing to both sides of the argument . \nBy sending planes and missiles , we help the U.N. and the resistance , and by only sending planes , we refrain from occupying another Mid-eastern country . \nI 'd rather we intervene than not . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 2:18 pm | It is the Constitutional responsibility of the US Congress to declar war on a sovereign nation . \nIt is not the domain of the President , and certainly not the domain of the UN . \nHowever there is some precedence for mischief . \nFor example , Harry Truman called the Korean war a `` police action . '' \nGhadafi appears to be criminally insane . \nHe must be removed . \nHowever , his enforcer is doing the damage while Ghadafi plays dress-up . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 2:19 pm | I feel now the America and the rest in the coalition need to remove Khadifi from power and if that results in his death , well so be it . \nIf he remains in power or is able to regain his power those that wish to be free in Libya will not have a chance . \nAlso , I feel Khadifi is capable of retaliation directed at any nation in the coalition . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 2:19 pm | Ali ; no mattr how you cut it US is leading to protect oil and Isreal March 21 , 2011 at 2:20 pm | This from a retired Army CSM : So are we going to attack Yemen Next ? \nIs Iran also in our lines of sight ? \nMay I ask who is oppressing the American people ? \nI say this administration . \nWe do n't get beat with a stick but we do get beat with higher and higher taxes to fund all these expeditions into the Arab world . \nWhen are American going to say , `` Enough ! '' \nWe have a responsibility to assist others as a good neighbors , but we are not the world 's police force nor are we funded to perform that task . . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 2:22 pm | We need to stay out of all of these other countries messes and focus on all of the problems that we have to deal with in the UNITED STATES ! \nIf we are going to get involved with every country that is having problems we will not be able to sustain ourselves . \nIf the Arabs want to go after Libya-let them ! \nThen they can quit their Monday morning quarter backing when they say they want something done but when it is done , oh not that much ! \nLet them invade Libya with their camels !! March 21 , 2011 at 2:22 pm | I am upset with the press ' coverage of the Middle East issues . \nTwo weeks ago CNN moderators implied the US\\/Obama was too slow to act in Libya . \nNow moderators question the wisdom of going in . \nThe discussion needs to be multi-dimensional before decisions are reached by government officials . \nOnce the decision is made , media should report on what is happening and stop second guessing . \nIt is too late now . \nWe are bombing another country in response to pressure to do so , and for reasons that are not clear ; unless we now have Bush two remaining in office to promote democracy through war . \nAlso , I note the Arab nations are not acting , only voicing support for the western nations that in time will be held accountable for all the problems in the region . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 2:23 pm | i dont think we should be in lybia or in iraq . \nmy stand point is that we are invovling ourselves in a well thought out stratigic plan to iraticate the middle east as well as our own country . \nwe dont need oil for everything around the world . \nwe can use other means of fuel that are less harmful and yet more efficient to our needs and will last longer than oil and is less expensive . \nthe UN should step in and say enough is enough and pull the troops out . \nhaveing the U.S. troops over in lybia is more damageing than effective . \nthis whole situation is like putting a sunroof in an out house . \nit doesnt make any sense nor does it belong . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 2:23 pm | Big mistake going to War with Libya . \nAbsolutely no justification for it . \nWe need to vote out these trigger happy politicians . \nHas America become a WAR Culture . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 2:26 pm | We hear these enormous costs reported for military actions -LRB- i.e. Libya , Afghanistan , Iraq , etc. -RRB- however , what is the real additional budget impact cost for such deployments ? \nI think costs reported are inflated and misleading . \nI m not saying there are not additional costs , but the military costs reported seem to be the total cost of the forces involved , directly and indirectly and I d just like to hear some real numbers and not sensationalized figures used to hype news reporting . \nTo my logic , the only major additional costs would be some percentage of spent ordinance and some cost for relocation of ground and maybe air forces . \nSalaries , housing , food , medical costs , fuel , etc. would be incurred even without such events . \nThese troops constantly train -LRB- sometimes with live ordinance -RRB- so most of the cost is already in the budgets of our military . \nOf course , ordinance cost would go up some percentage , cost of additional transportation of troops , equipment , etc. to the deployment locations , and probably some percentage increase fuel expenditures . \nI also understand that some percentage of housing vacated , including energy cost would still be incurred , but should be reduced . \nAs a Viet Nam veteran , I m certainly not disregarding , disrepecting or minimizing the human cost in any way . \nLoss of life , injuries and certainly the mental impact on family members are terrible costs indeed and my heart goes out to those involved . \nHowever , it is very difficult to directly calculate these factors as a cost of a military deployment and are totally different discussions . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 2:27 pm | Nature wreaks such havoc on humanity , how dare we wreak havoc on each other ... period . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 2:31 pm | US has been very cautious this time around before taking any military action . \nObama wanted the UN and NATO allies also to have a more role in the decision making . \nI think he is being very prudent given the country 's economy and perception by the outside world . \nBut this whole excersice could have been expedited so that we could have saved many innocent lives . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 2:31 pm | I 'm all for helping other countries , But what about the US Why in return for the help are we not getting Binladin handed to us on a silver plater ! \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 2:32 pm | I believe that there should be no more involvement by the United States in Libya . \nAs was said by one in the Quaker Church many years ago , `` There is NO way to peace . \nPeace IS THE WAY ! '' \nThis threatens to be another Iraq or Afghanistan . \nWe were told in the beginning of either war that it would last only as long as necessary and that it would be a short war . \nBut here we are , nearly a decade after , with American troops still there . \nPresident Obama said in his speech from Chile that Libyan people deserved no more violence , yet he is authorizing the exercise of violence in Libya ? \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 2:36 pm | I guess finally a U.S. Administration realizes that a democratic Middle East better and safer for America and the whole world , than a Middle East run by dictatorships and monarchies , that oppress their people . \nA democratic Middle East better for the future everybody . \nYou can not recruit and radicalize people if they are doing well economically . \nI hope that I will see this happening in my life time . \nThere is an old saying : A rose by any other name , etc. . \nSimilarly , regime change by any other name is still regime change . \nLike it or not , Gadhafi is the established leader of Libya as evidenced by his control of the military and the support he enjoys from all those Libyans that are not in the street protesting or rebelling . \nThe US and its coalition are taking military action in another sovereign Mid East country on the pretext that they are protecting innocent civilians . \nI d like to point out that the people the coalition is protecting have commandeered tanks , artillery , anti-aircraft guns , thousands of automatic weapons , anti-tank weapons , explosives , and troop carriers , and are using those weapons to attack the established government . \nThese are not the actions of civilians . \nThe instant you pick up a weapon and take violent action against your government you are no longer a civilian ; you are an armed rebel and the government has every right to fight back . \nThe Security Council s resolution authorizing a no-fly zone ultimately prevents the legitimate government of Libya from defending itself against violent , militarized rebel forces . \nLibyan forces can not advance against the rebels without coalition military forces attacking . \nNo such restriction has been placed on the rebels . \nIn essence , the coalition has taken sides by backing armed rebels and creating a situation where the established Libyan leadership can do nothing except sit and wait to be overrun . \nThrowing the military weight of the coalition nations behind the rebels while at the same time hamstringing the ability of the legitimate government to resist the rebellion , IS regime change . \nSince that is obviously the goal , at least have the courage to say it and let the people of the coalition nations involved hold their own governments accountable for the decision . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 2:45 pm | As a libyan , i think that what the us is doing or is trying to do is very helpful at this moment . \nIf i wasnt libyan i might say oh america is playing iraq2 again or there only there for the oil . \nBut as a libyan seeing what happens to my country from day to day , seeing my family and friends die ever so simply , i say we need al the help we can get , for me at the moment i dont care about the oil or the supplies my country gives i care about the people in my country . \nI think now we sould forget all the statistics and think as humans , , , when people are being massacerd they do need help ... . \nIn total i appreciate what the un is doing for us and its a favor we wont forget March 21 , 2011 at 2:47 pm | Against any involvement . \nMideast will rule as they choose before & after our intervention . \nUS has to focus on our needs ; cities & states are going broke . \nPeople here need jobs and food to feed their families . \nWe ca n't continue to police the world . \nWhen are our leaders going to understand that . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 2:48 pm | Okay now I 'm just venting . \nNO , I do n't think we should be there . \nI think we should stop being dependent on oil from the Middle East . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 2:50 pm | According to CNN Benghazi residents are getting threatening phone calls naming family members as targets unless they support Gadhafi and company . \nAlong with the tank attacks , this is a cease-fire breach . \nTo bring an end to such activity , use a non-atomic super bomb to end Gadhafi 's killing fellow Arabs . \nThe Saudi royal family was targeted the same way . \nThe UN forces -LRB- It is a US bomb . -RRB- \ncould set one off in the water near Tripoli so Gadhafi 's generals can see it . \nTell them this is an option they now face . \nThey must comply with the UN resolution or a pro-Gadhafi area will be next . \nThey must show this by moving tanks , all military and all agents away from opposition areas . \nThey could also arrest Colonel Gadhafi and sons for crimes against humanity . \nThis approach minimalized deaths and stopped WW II being longer . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 3:00 pm | Misrata is under attack by Pro-Gadhafi forces ? \nThe U.S. is ramping DOWN operations ? \nWe always seem to get involved then leave people hanging -LRB- KURDS in First Gulf War -RRB- et . \nLet 's Finish this with coalition help . \nHelp and Security must be given to all in Libya , not just Benghazi ! \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 3:52 pm | i am sitting here sad and confused . \nIdo n't mind helping people any way we can and i know alot of americans feel the same way . \nwhen will the goverment top brass in the house and senate and even the white house oval office going to help the poor and hungry here in our the u.s. our goverment says we are broke when it comes to affairs in our own back yard but , always the first in line to send funds and supplies to other countrys who probably would n't be able to help us in times of need . \ndo n't get me wrong i am truely sorry for what is going on in these 's other places but , charity begins at home . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 4:15 pm | Just a quick word regarding Arwa Damon 's report on the damage sustained by Gadhaffi 's forces on the outskirts of Benghazi -- Arwa highlights the antiquated machinery of the Libyan War and singles out what she calls a `` World War Two Willys Jeep '' . \nThe vehicle is in fact a Ford Mutt , which does look vaguely like an old Jeep but much bigger and more angular with horizontal slats in the front grille -- and which was produced right up until the 1980 's -- which is still kinda current technology when you consider that Blackhawk Helicopters , Hummvees and Abrams Tanks are all of the same vintage . \nA trifling detail in the grand scheme of things I know - but the article in which Arwa makes the error is on heavy rotation on CNN right now and I guess it weakens the accuracy of her entire reportage for me -- perhaps in large part because Arwa does really seem to make a point of highlighting this `` old '' machine to make a coloring point to her report . \nI support wat the U.N. is doin gadhafi needs to be out of power people are going to lose their lives either way but hopefully if we get involved not as many people will have to suffer that fate . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 4:59 pm | The issue does not seem to be as complicated as is it has been made to seem . \nEvery human has the right to live . \nThe current action is just to stop a dictator from slaughtering his own people and let them decided what they want for their country . \nGaddafi is only loved by his people as long as he holds the stick over their head . \nAllow the people the people the security and safety to freely chose their leader and the removal of Gaddafi becomes a mute point . \nIt is also interesting how all the politicians are so upset about Obama taking action without allowing to endlessly debate and take polls while people were dying . \nAction was taken without their input , approval or even an explanation . \nThey need to take stock of the anger , frustration and helplessness that they feel because now they know what it is like to be part of the shrinking middle class in this country . \nThe democrats give to the ones at the bottom , the republicans give to the ones at the top and the middle class is left with the bill . \nSo who is going to rescue us from them ? \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:17 pm | Yes , our involvement is correct . \nAnd for all the nay sayers claiming we are more involved than the president indicated we would be , I would suggest they rerun Defense Secretary Gates comments that it would be more involved than people think . \nPreventing fly overs requires destroying the ability of the enemy to fly and kill so we must destroy those abilities . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 8:06 pm | I think , or at least I believe , that many , including members of Congress , forget what principles this country was founded on and what we are all about . \nCrying foul now because they were n't properly consulted before hand seems ludicrous at best . \nThis situation has been brewing for some time and delaying action any longer would have led to the loss of countless lives in Benghazi . \nCongress had ample time to discuss the developing situation and choose a course for the American people . \nThe fact that it came to the point where the President was forced , although reluctantly , to take action in order to save human lives is something he should not have had to deal with , but he did . \nI believe that the Obama Administration not only took the correct action but should be applauded for having the courage to do so . \nI am a former service member and it concerns me a great deal anytime our men and woman in the armed forces are put in harms way in any way , shape or form , but I am a realist . \nI am an American , often hated , or at least scorned , around the world by many , but still recognized as a global champion for human rights and the oppressed . \nIt is our destiny , wanted or not . \nIt is who we are and a great part of not only our history , but of our character . \nOur country was founded by those seeking the freedom of pursuing their own destiny , limited by only their dreams and level of commitment and we believe that is the right of all people We are Americans and we will always answer the call of those oppressed that ask for help and want to exercise their natural right to pursue a rewarding life and control their own destiny . \nWe may be hated by many , misunderstood by most , but when all is said and done , the free world and anyone that has a dream of that freedom , sleep better at night and find the courage and strength to face each new day with continued hope , because we are who we are . \nThank you for providing the medium for me to express my views and sincerest gratitude to all at CNN and other agencies that put themselves in danger to keep us informed . \nBe safe and continue to make a difference . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 8:20 pm | My husband asked me to post this quote : No man is an Island , entire of itself ; every man is a piece of the Continent , a part of the main ; if a clod be washed away by the sea , Europe is the less , as well as if a promontory were , as well as if a manor of thy friends or of thine own were ; any man 's death diminishes me , because I am involved in Mankind ; And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls ; It tolls for thee . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 10:37 pm | Has anyone read `` The war powers act of 1973 '' ? \nIf so , you must know that Obama is saying `` Oops '' . \nLike his own healthcare bill he forgot to read this , too . \nIf taken up by Congress this could be an impeachable offense only if we are in Libya for more than 90 days . \nI think Obama forgot to consult Congress prior to his acting on this one . \nThe President MUST consult Congress so that they can DEBATE it prior to sending our troops overseas -LRB- for more than 90 days -RRB- . \nI welcome your ideas and thoughts on this subject with facts only not with emotions . \nMarch 22 , 2011 at 7:34 am | Under the war powers act of 1973 George W. did have a right to go into Afganistan since we were acted on U.S. soil on 9\\/11 without consulting the Congress . \nIt was later concluded that Iraq was a legal action as well . \nMarch 22 , 2011 at 7:43 am | First off , CNN 's coverage has been exceptional . \nI 'm thinking AC is responsible for keeping both Egypt and Libya a news story when no other mainstream outlet was covering it . \nHis reaction to the unfolding events was visceral and powerful . \nYes , it is true other genocides have occurred with no one noticing . \nThat does n't mean we should n't stop this one . \nIt means we should be noticing the others . \nGovernments that kill and terrorize their own people hurt us all . \nI 'm already getting tired of all the political second guessing that is starting up . \nI pretty much put John Boehner and Dennis Kucinich on mute or realize it 's time to turn off the set . \nMarch 22 , 2011 at 8:09 am | Any chance that Russia and China might try to take us out for being the bully of the Middle East ? \nSince we owe China , this action against us MIGHT make us reconsider the amount of money we spend on defense instead of paying down our bills . \nMarch 22 , 2011 at 8:13 am | Whatever the case concerning charges that journalists at the Gadhafi compound are being used as human shields , it would be prudent for CNN management to take its journalists OUT of there ASAP . \nFirst , it 's UNSEEMLY for them to be seen in-situ commenting on US air strikes while government die-hards wave fragments of missiles . \nSecond -LRB- and far more important -RRB- , it 's best they not be conveniently at hand when\\/should Gadhafi supporters feel they have nothing to lose by taking Western journalists down with them . \nNic Robertson and his family deserve better treatment than this . \nMarch 22 , 2011 at 11:00 am | I question the honesty of the Administration regarding Libya . \nWhile Obama said there will be no American boots on the ground , I have a friend who is a mechanic on track vehicles who has orders for Libya . \nWhy are Marines ordered to Libya if there is no intention of having ground troops ? \nMarch 22 , 2011 at 11:39 am | Now that we 're semi-officially involved and our alliance with the others are falling apart ... we need to clearly state our intentions : we will help the opposition forces to remove Gadhafi-dead\\/alive as well his sons , help the opposition forces get their acts together to form a united front with a credible leader so that once Gadhafi is out there is some sort of a new government so that the transition is smooth . \nOnce we establish a credible opposition shadow government make sure that we and the European Infidels has no intentions of occupying Libya until the oil runs dry . \nBeing wishy-washy like the Obama administration will make our Nato alliance a laughing stock similar to the United Nothing -LRB- United Nation -RRB- . \nIf Prez O does n't know the next step , check with Billary Clinton for advice . \nWe need a strong leader like Billary when he pulled out of Somalia when G.H. Bush was wishy-washy when our brave soldiers was captured and dragged through the streets of Mogidishu ! \nAlso Billary tried not to get totally involved in the Balkan mess . \nMarch 22 , 2011 at 12:10 pm | last week all -LRB- Arab League , French , Libyan rebels , GOP etc. etc. -RRB- were calling for the President to move on Libya . \nNow the same voices are calling foul . \nGOP hopefuls especially are trying to get the most milage out of this . \nThough she never really said you could n't , maybe they can have their cake and eat it too . \nMarch 22 , 2011 at 12:13 pm | The world has been watching the developments in Libya for weeks and the fact that we are now just responding to all the slaughters is sickening . \nThe U.S. stands for freedom and justice ; we must help those in need and not become another passive nation . \nMarch 22 , 2011 at 12:18 pm | I see no reason for confusion on the UN mission . \nThe military commanders for the intervention are clear on their mission , which does not include regime change . \nPresident Obama does not say that it does , but he does say that regime change is in Libya is a priority of his administration . \nSee how that works ? \nUS policy is not dictated by the UN , and the US does not dictate the policies of the UN . \nMarch 22 , 2011 at 1:09 pm | We should n't even be there , it 's the UN 's problem . \nLet them step up to the plate before we start policing the world . \nSame goes for Afghanistan and other neighboring Arab countries . \nMarch 22 , 2011 at 1:13 pm | I have been following the story closely since the `` rebels '' first started to protest in Benghazzi . \nThey were shot at and the army defected . \nIf we did not intervene may of thousands would have been slaughtered , perhaps 100 's of thousands . \nWe did the right thing . \nIt makes me prouder to be American . \nMarch 22 , 2011 at 1:16 pm | I support our effort in Libya , the end game should be the removal of the current regime . \nWe as Americans have a moral obligaation to people living in fear of their lives everyday . \nI believe also that the Congress should back the decision to rescue the Libyan people , with no reservations and hinesite quarterbacking . \nMarch 22 , 2011 at 1:25 pm | US has no business invading Lybia or any other country . \nIn his own words : The President does not have power under the Constitution to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation , Barack Obama , the constitutional scholar gave us assurance these were NOT within the powers of the presidency . \nBarack Obama the president seems to have changed his mind . \nIf we want to take our financial situation seriously , we need to at least account for the overextended military empire we continuously expand . \nThe best immediate solution would be to bring all of the troops home . \nFrom Lybia , Iraq , Afghanistan , Korea , Germany , and the other 190 or so countries we occupy . \nOnly when we stop spending endless trillions of dollars on our military imperialism can we start on the path to getting our financial house in order . \nThroughout history , all empires have fallen by overreaching militarily and overprinting the money . \nLet us hope the US learns from this example , and does not go the way of past empires . \nMarch 22 , 2011 at 1:39 pm | I think it 's great , America should be fighting for freedom . \nIf Ronald Reagan had taken care of this before we would n't have to do it again . \nMarch 22 , 2011 at 2:13 pm | What gives this country the right to attack Libya ? \nIn what I think is a internal affair . \nWas n't going into Irag without a good reason enough . \nMarch 22 , 2011 at 2:15 pm | Before the President acted on Qadaffi most everyone was calling him too slow to act . \nNow that he has acted many opportunist are up in arm against him . \nAs American we must be consistant in standing up for what is right . \nWe sometimes worry too much about the cosequenses and fail to finish the job . \nThat is when the consequences turn out negative . \nAlthough late , but President Obama acted properly and I am with him all the way till Qadaffi is out . \nAfter all he is a monster who destroyed a passenger airliner killing many innocent people and litterally got away with it . \nIt is time to make him pay for his crimes against humanity . \nA job that the paper-tiger UN should do . \nMarch 22 , 2011 at 2:15 pm | We should have intervened sooner . \nThe fact that Obama waited as long as he did signifies to me that he wavered in his decision making . \nIt makes me , as a veteran of the armed forces , question his ability to lead our military . \nThe people of Libya cried out for our help and we had ample time to bring it before our politicians . \nPres. Obama would have been able to consult with those military leaders to develop a plan that identified specific details . \nMarch 22 , 2011 at 2:17 pm | Are you kidding me ? \nwhen Ronald Regan bombed Libya he was considered a hero and rightfully so , let 's ALL act like American 's for a change and support our president . \nMarch 22 , 2011 at 2:17 pm | In considering this matter of intervention in Libya , which is in fact beyond what might be done in an ideal situation , there may be a feeling that we have to maintain involvement in order to protect ourselves and our allies in that part of the world , including Israel\\/Palestine . \nIf some group overpowers Gadhafi , we can t be standing at a distance , watching , we have to be right there in the thick of it . \nIt would be wonderful if we could follow legal and what would seem to be moral values , and allow some victor , whoever it might be to control Libya , and the Mediterranean region , and of course the oil . \nAt this point is looks as though Gadhafi is incapable of continuing to rule . \nHe has an army of enemies seeking to overthrow him . \nHis speech is incoherent ; when he punishes people under his authority , he is irrational , saying they are using hallucinogenic drugs , or are spreading aids , and moral turpitude . \nHis officers do the most unthinkable things that are ever done in the torture of prisoners . \nIf as I liberal I find myself surprised by American President Obama s actions , it is because I don t see the entire picture . \nWe have to protect our allies , our interests , and it is good that we can support democracy in Libya . \nWhen the smoke clears , we will be there in the forefront to do just that . \nMarch 22 , 2011 at 2:19 pm | As an Azerbaijani - American muslim , I fully support Libya no no fly zone . \nIt has already saved hundreds of lives in BeGhazi , I hope other cities like Misurata , Abdjadiya can be freed as well . \nI do not understand those who oppose our involvement . \nIs it better to stay back and watch innocent Libyans butchered ? \nI hope we can help the opposition to get Ghaddafi out of Libya , otherwise it is going to be an unfinished job . \nLong live freedom and democracy . \nMarch 22 , 2011 at 2:20 pm | I believe the US should be there . \nThe Leader of Libya should be in Prison or hung . \nThat is what we do with killers in this country . \nThe elected officials should support the troops and this engagement . \nI believe the UN Over rides everything . \nMarch 22 , 2011 at 2:20 pm | I am glad we are helping the Libyan people . \nThe U.S. does stand for freedom and we must help to keep the people from being slaughtered . \nSome congress members are upset because they could n't vote on it . \nBut I 'm afraid if we had waited for them to vote more slathers would 've have occured . \nMarch 22 , 2011 at 2:23 pm | Anyone can second guess . . \nLet 's applaud the fact that American is helping as PART of an international coalition . \nIt would behoove members of Congress , many of whom have not served in the armed forces and have no experience in running even a modest operation , to simply support the President 's decision or shut up . \nAfter all , this is the Congress who ca n't even find a reasonable solution to our budget challenges . \nWhy would anyone , including the American public , consult Congress on any serious topic . \nOnly history will tell whether the President 's decision was a good one . \nBut at least it was thoughtful and considered . \nespecially given the circumstances . \nMarch 22 , 2011 at 2:27 pm | Wow you folks have a lot of emails to sift thru . \nI 'll make mine brief . \nI worked in Libya for 5 years and made some friends there that I often think about these days . \nWhen talking about the costs incurred by the U.S. and its allies , all I think about is the colonels frozen U.S. , and I 'm sure there is more elsewhere , assets . \nWhy ca n't these be funneled into the price of saving his people ? \nAfter all , its money that should have been used , or given to them in the first place , right ? \nThe same goes for the money he is sitting on in Libya !!! I 'm sure the people would n't mind because with him in power they would never see it anyways !!! Hell I 'd let Obama cut himself a cheque right now if it meant saving the lives of my family !! It 's not a perfect world . \nI think President Obama is doing the best he can for the people of Libya . \nWe wanted the world community to get together to save the people of Gadhafi from massacring his own people . \nThis took time which is unfortunate . \nThe reason we are not attacking other governments such as Bahrain is that we have some influence there and are trying to help the situation diplomatically . \nI see no inconsistency in U.S. policy . \nWhatever happens in those countries we can say that we did our best . \nWe prefer peace and diplomacy but will stand up for right . \nWe seek to be apart of this earth and not to dominate it . \nLet 's get behind our President and pray that he leads us with wisdom and humility . \nMarch 22 , 2011 at 2:30 pm | Its a crying shame , such a dissapointement that again , WE -LRB- US -RRB- , appoint ourself as the `` world police '' . \nDissapointed indeed that our president on top of ignoring and abandoning most if not all of his campaing promises , gets us in another war . \nYes , ANOTHER WAR !! Dropping bombs on foreign soil is an act of war no matter how one chooses to sugar coat it ! \nMore appalling to many , is the apathy of the americans in general . \nGone the era of activism when we utilized freedom of speech and assembly to demonstrate our dissapointment and discontent with our government motives and actions . \nPresident Obama is gradually becoming another `` Bush '' clone , another corporation muppet . \nWhen our government will understand that ONLY the middle east can and should help and support itself . \nShame on me , mostly , for just posting a few words , , , , March 22 , 2011 at 2:35 pm | Well I uess I must have it wrong . \nI thought that Nato said they could use any means available to them to stop Gadhafi from kill his own people . \nSo why is that some people are having a problem with the way they are taking out his tanks , troops and anything else he has to use to kill the Libyian people just because he do n't want to give up power over them . \nGet it straight either people want democracy or you do n't ca n't have it both ways . \nSo leave the coalition alone and let them do the right thing for a change and not go just for oil . \nI sure do n't agree with going anywhere and fight for the wrong reason , but this is for the right reason . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 7:41 pm | It is my opinion that the leader in the case of Libya is not the US but a combination of France and The UK . \nThe US as a member helped out by firing missiles into that country . \nTo get Kadhaffi out of Libya is a matter for the UN to decide and NOT the US . \nWe have too many other problems to deal with rather than at this time to focus on Libya . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 8:26 pm | We can not sit back and watch slaughter being committed . \nThere is no time to wait for NATO or The Arab League to make up their mind to make a commitment . \nThe Europeans have difficulty reaching a decision after the EU was formed -- it 's like waiting for Congress to reach a decision -LRB- eternity -RRB- . \nThe members of the Arab League are inundated in problems of their own and we ca n't expect much support from that front . \nWe will have to solve this , as we go along , with no clear cut theories other than our humanitarian concern and trust in our abilities . \nWe should be proud of such an ability . \nHow many of these `` rebels ' are returning fighters whom entered via Syria to fight US forces in Iraq ? \nIs the muslim brotherhood involved in this conflict ? \nThe tribal system of Libya should be explained in far more detail ? \nHidden agenda among returning fighters whom fought in Iraq to return home and radicalize their home countries upon return ? \nMarch 24 , 2011 at 9:54 am | Obama has handled the Libyan situation very well , accomplishing the most critical goal , preventing the imminent slaughter of civilian opposition as promised by MG . \nThe quick switch of positions -LRB- from pro- intervention to con -RRB- by the GOP simply reflects the fact that the GOP are more focused upon the political advantage they can gain from this than on the long-term interests of the USA . \nMarch 24 , 2011 at 11:43 am | It is interesting to speculate re : what the news opinions would have been if the USA and other countries had not urgently intervened - the video showing bodies of slaughtered civilians would dominate our conversations and Obama would be condemned for being heartless and ineffectual and timid . \nAs for having the decision made in Congress - you have to be kidding ! \nCongress is just the Super Bowl of politics , from which an occasional legislative decision may escape . \nMarch 24 , 2011 at 11:52 am | Yes we should be involving ourselves with the Libyan peoples struggle for freedom . \nWhat if we had n't gotten involved during either World War ? \nAlot of people would n't be here and those that were would be speaking German , Italian or Japanese . \nThe right thing to do is the right thing to do . \nHe kills his own people and thinks he can get away with it . \nThose people that say we should n't be involved need to read their history before they open their mouths . \nAppeasement and isolationism only further the problem . \nThe US tried that early in the last century , did n't work so well , and cost many more lives than it would have if we had been helping the world instead of hiding behind the oceans and had a stronger military . \nNeville Chamberlain and the League of Nations tried appeasement with Hitler , then when he was too strong for them to stop they said `` No ! \nYou ca n't do that ! '' \nHe did it anyway and five years later we were klucky enough that he offed himself . \nWe were n't prepared then as we are now . \nOh and another difference of course is people back in the early twentieth century were apparently a whole helluvalot more patriotic than they are today . \nI 'm trying to re-enlist in the service because it 's the right thing to do , how many people today would have to be drafted before they 'd put on a uniform ? \nMarch 24 , 2011 at 2:29 pm | Yes let 's bring the troops back from everywhere we 're involved that 's not in America and show the world how truly idiotic we are . \nYes , we spend money on the military , the alternative would be somebody stronger than us invading and then how 'd you like your idiotic opinions that are not based off of any factual basis or historical knowledge of events ? \nOh , that 's right , you would n't be able to speak your mind on these websites . \nStop moaning about how much we spend on the military and be glad they do n't draft all of you arm chair politicos into the Army and send you over to a war as cannon fodder . \nBe glad you have poor dumb shmucks like us who volunteer to do what you obviously are unwilling to . \nGive us the materials to do the job and be happy it is n't you . \nIf you 'd take a look at history , oh let me just use an example : the first day of the Battle of the Sommes in 1916 the British Army lost fiffty eight thousand men killed and thousands more wounded because they were n't prepared for the fight and the civilian factory workers in munitions plants were to busy worrying about their little worlds being screwed up . \nGuess what , casualties suck , but war happens , people die , and be glad we have n't fought a World War in over sixty years . \nCuz if we did nowadays the casualties would be measured in billions , not millions . \nBe glad we take part in world affairs , be glad we have those cruise missiles . \nHonestly I 'd much rather waste millions of dollars on sending a missile in rather than sending my infantry buddies in to get killed . \nMarch 24 , 2011 at 2:39 pm | I 've noticed that credit restoration activity should be conducted with tactics . \nIf not , you might find yourself damaging your standing . \nIn order to grow into success fixing your credit score you have to confirm that from this moment you pay your monthly expenses promptly prior to their appointed date . \nIt is really significant on the grounds that by certainly not accomplishing that , all other activities that you will decide to try to improve your credit ranking will not be powerful . \nThanks for expressing your strategies . \nJuly 13 , 2012 at 2:26 am | -LRB- required , but will not be displayed -RRB- CNN welcomes a lively and courteous discussion as long as you follow the Rules of Conduct set forth in our Terms of Service . \nComments are not pre-screened before they post . \nYou agree that anything you post may be used , along with your name and profile picture , in accordance with our Privacy Policy and the license you have granted pursuant to our Terms of Service . \nMe and my producer @EliseMiller At LAPD HQ look at this artsy shot thanks to our photographer . \n3:53 pm ET February 11 , 2013 RETWEET @ChasityBlues hey -- he was nervous . \ngive him a break . \npoor guy 's wife is stuck ! \n"}
{"id": "158", "time": "2011-03-21", "text": "Libya and Iraq : What 's different Peter Bergen : Some compare military action in Libya to Iraq War He says there are major differences , including Arab League 's vote vs. Gadhafi Bergen says the Iraq War was strongly opposed by Arab nations Gadhafi is widely reviled in the Arab world , Bergen says Editor 's note : Peter Bergen is the director of the national security studies program at the New America Foundation in Washington ; a fellow at New York University 's Center on Law and Security ; and CNN 's national security analyst . \nHe is the author of the new book , '' The Longest War : The Enduring Conflict between America and Al-Qaeda . '' \n-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A critique of the U.S. involvement in the military intervention in Libya that will no doubt be common in coming days is that the Obama administration is making a large error by embarking on a war with a third Muslim country , as if reversing Moammar Gadhafi 's momentum against the rebels will be a rerun of the debacle of the war against Saddam Hussein . \nA further element of this view is that -- whatever the outcome of the Libyan intervention -- the United States ' standing in the Islamic world will once again be severely damaged by an attack on a Muslim nation . \nThere are , of course , some real similarities between Hussein and Gadhafi -- both ruthless and erratic dictators of oil-rich regimes who fought bloody wars with their neighbors , brutalized their own populations , sought weapons of mass destruction , and sired some equally unattractive sons and heirs . \nThe dj vu quality of the Libyan situation may help account for recent polls taken before the intervention which found that while Americans were either split or slightly in favor of imposing a no-fly zone over Libya , most were opposed to stronger U.S. military action . \nThe military intervention that President Obama authorized against Libya on Saturday ... is a quite different operation than the 2003 invasion of Iraq . \nBut the military intervention that President Obama authorized against Libya on Saturday -- eight years to the day after President George W. Bush announced the commencement of `` Operation Iraqi Freedom '' -- is a quite different operation than the 2003 invasion of Iraq . \nBeyond the obvious difference that Obama has not authorized the use of U.S. ground forces in Libya , there are several other differences to consider : First , the Obama administration was handed a gift by the Arab League , which in its more than six-decade history has garnered a well-earned reputation as a feckless talking shop , but unusually took a stand one week ago by endorsing a no-fly zone over Libya . \nThat endorsement put the Arab League way out in front of the Obama administration , which was then dithering about whether to do anything of substance to help the rebels fighting Gadhafi . \nThe unexpected action by the Arab League gave the administration the impetus and diplomatic cover to then go to the United Nations Security Council to secure a broad resolution endorsing not only a no-fly zone , but also allowing member states to `` take all necessary measures '' to protect civilians in Libya . \nThis U.N. resolution is reminiscent of the one that President George H.W. Bush secured in November 1990 , which gave Iraq six weeks to withdraw from Kuwait following Hussein 's invasion of that country . \nThe U.N. resolution in 1990 similarly empowered states to use `` all necessary means '' to force Iraq out of Kuwait if Hussein ignored the deadline . \nThe similarities do not end there . \nThe coalition that massed to drive Hussein out of Kuwait involved significant forces from major Muslim countries such as Saudi Arabia and Pakistan . \nSo too the Libyan no-fly zone will be enforced by Qatar , along with western powers such as France and the U.K. . \nThis is all quite in contrast to George W. Bush 's ineffectual attempts to gather international support for the invasion of Iraq in 2003 . \nThere was no U.N. resolution explicitly authorizing the use of military force against Hussein , and no Muslim countries participated in the American invasion and occupation of Iraq . \nIndeed , before the March 2003 invasion of Iraq , the Turkish parliament voted against allowing American troops passage across Turkey to invade northern Iraq , which put a wrench in U.S. military planning . \nUnderlining the fact that the Iraq War was widely viewed as illegitimate by Muslim countries , the same year that Turkey voted against allowing American soldiers to use its soil to attack Iraq , Turkish soldiers were also leading the International Security Assistance Force helping to keep the peace in post-Taliban Afghanistan , a military operation that was also authorized by the United Nations and was not seen as illegitimate by much of the Muslim world . \nThe Bush administration 's largely unilateral decision to go to war in Iraq -LRB- the U.K. and a few other nations provided troops -RRB- undermined America 's standing in Islamic countries . \nA poll taken a few months after the 2003 invasion found that Indonesians , Jordanians , Turks , and Moroccans all expressed more `` confidence '' that Osama bin Laden would `` do the right thing '' than that Bush would . \nAccording to a poll four years later , America 's favorability rating stood at 9 % in Turkey -LRB- down from 52 % before September 11 , 2001 -RRB- and 29 % in Indonesia -LRB- down from 75 % before September 11 -RRB- . \nFinally , another key difference between the Iraq war and the Libyan operation is that the casus belli for Iraq was based on highly classified intelligence accessible to few people -- later proved to be wrong -- that Saddam Hussein continued to maintain a weapons of mass destruction program . \nBy contrast , the Libyan intervention was caused by the real time evidence provided by the world 's leading media organizations -- including , of course , Al Jazeera -- that Gadhafi is massacring his own people . \nThe high level of anti-Americanism in the Muslim world that was generated by the Iraq War is unlikely to be replicated by U.S. military action against Libya , because Gadhafi is widely reviled in the Arab world . \nHis antics on the world stage have earned him the enmity of even his fellow autocrats -- who will not be welcoming him if he chooses to `` retire '' to Saudi Arabia as other murderous dictators of his ilk have in the past -LRB- think Idi Amin -RRB- . \nAnd the fact that both the Arab League and the United Nations have endorsed a military action against Gadhafi strongly suggests that the Libyan intervention will not generate a renewed wave of anti-Americanism in the Muslim world . \nInstead , it underlines a striking feature of the protests that have roiled the Middle East in the past several weeks : Strikingly absent from those protests has been the ritualized burning of American flags , something that hitherto was largely pro forma in that part of the world . \nThat 's because Arabs have finally been able to express publicly that their biggest enemy is not the United States , but their own rulers . \nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Peter Bergen . \n"}
{"id": "85", "time": "2011-03-21", "text": "I interviewed Rashid Khalidi , the Edward Said Professor of Modern Arab Studies at Columbia University , about ten days ago after he spoke with Fareed . \nBut his take on why Egypt and Turkey - two major regional powers - might be reluctant to intervene in Libya is as relevant now as ever . \nHere s what he had to say : Egypt is a country which has the largest number of foreign citizens working in Libya . \nThey are potential hostages should Gadhafi and his brutal regime perceive Egypt as intervening against his interests . \nGadhafi has shown no compunction about taking hostages in the past . \nI know this is a consideration for Egypt . \nI ve talked to people who have had input from the Arab League Foreign Ministers meeting and one of the things that was made clear at that meeting was that while Egypt really does support the idea of transition in Libya and wants to play a role , they feel terribly constrained by the fact that they have over a million Egyptians working in Libya ... This is apparently also a problem for Turkey , which is another regional power like Egypt that actually has capabilities . \nI mean , -LRB- if -RRB- you get the Turkish military or the Egyptian military involved in something in Libya , -LRB- then -RRB- you are actually talking about quite considerable capabilities . \nBut Turkey has a lot of investments and also a lot of people - workers and business people - in Libya . \nSo I think these are constraints on both of them . \nAnd in the case of Egypt , the military is running Egypt . \nThe last thing they need is to be charged with running Libya . \nIf Egyptian ground troops go in , I promise you that ll be the next thing - they are going to be stuck there . \nThe final thing for Egypt - and this is a consideration that we have to keep in mind - is that the Egyptians are afraid of Libyan sensitivities . \nThe Libyans have always chafed at the idea of Egypt as an overbearing big brother . \nThey ve always been sensitive to that . \nAnything that Egypt does has to be weighed in light of that perception , -LRB- and potential -RRB- misinterpretations or overreactions on the part of the Libyans . \nThe opinions expressed are solely those of Rashid Khalidi . \nThe reasons mentioned here are real , but not the most important ones . \nThe most important reason is the understanding by those two leading countries in the region the deep resentment that the population have over Western meddling . \nAnd this time , it is no exception . \nUN Resolution authorizing no fly zone and the use of all means necessary to protect the population , has been in no time flat `` interpreted '' into full scale agression . \nIndiscriminate targeting of civilian infrastructure , from roads to hospitals , electric and sewer plants , are telling much about the nature of this campaign , that was supposed to `` protect the population '' . \nThe countries that ABSTAINED did so in GOOD FAITH , that is , the respect of the resolutions 's goal - the protection of innocent population . \nThe criticism is mounting from all sides on the nature of bombing , the use of cruise missiles on population centers , and the mounting civilian casualties . \nEgypt and Turkey both are in the same situation : they are heavily dependent on the public opinion . \nAnd at present , the public opinion is heaving tilted against any Western intervention . \nIn no time , the mission approved by UN SC , descended from its objectives into full-fledged attack on Libya . \nSo , instead of enforcing no-fly zone , arms embargo , and humanitarian aid delivery , the first acts were to target all forms of infrastructure - both military and civilian , followed by the supply of arms to the rebels . \nHumanitarian assistance , under the conditions of continued coordinated missile and aereal bombardment , has been rendered impossible . \nClearly , the civilian population in Gadhafi controlled areas are treated as military , as no protection is afforded them , and whatever they had in reserves has been bombed out . \nThe zeal shown here by the trio , US , UK and France , surely compares unfavorably with the lack of attention to the nuclear power plants in Japan spewing radioactive particle clouds all the way to US . \nLet us talk about Libya , by all means . \nSo we can not talk about our kids being blanketed by radioactive fallout . \nAll the soothsaying by officials only causes higher alarm , as their statements reflect calculated ignorance - something a sharp third grader can spot . \nThey talk about sea water being better at diluting the radioactivity , or funnier yet , how we are in no danger from RADIATION ! \nAs if we are so ignorant ! \nBy all means , we are not worried about radiation , but we are about radioactive MATTER in clouds of radioactive debris , blanketing our country with particles of cesium and plutonium . \nAnd everything we touch , inhale or eat , will carry these particles into our bodies . \nThis is the danger to our health , while our leaders fiddle over Libya , like Nero fiddling while Rome was burning . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 2:27 pm | Reply I agree with Bianca . \nI believe that original article was written to misguide public in a subtle way . \nTurkish and Egyptians have done the wise thing not to associate with western pro Israel powers . \nThe bombing clearly showed that the purpose was more than just halting Qaddafi . \nThe facilities being damaged belong to Libyan people and not Qaddafi . \nUltimate billions of dollars will go back to western countries to rebuild them . \nI agree that Turkey is in a position to help and they must . \nTurkish president needs to fly to Tripoli with some of heads of the Muslim state under Organization of Islamic Countries . \nThey need to meet both Qaddafi and Opposition in Benghazi and work out a deal . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 3:46 pm | Reply This Libyan civil unrest is going now and three weeks , why during this time these two Islamic countries have not done anything to stop the fighting , and specially after Qaddafi got the upper hand and threatened to crash his enemies ? \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 4:08 pm | Specifically what facilities are you suggesting should not have been bombed ? \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 4:21 pm | The Arabs have not intervened in Libya because they are all busy at home with unrest . \nSaudi Arabia is busy with self preservation of Sunni rule in Bahrain . \nAnything other than self-preservation is really not of much importance to this Saudi and Sunni royal family . \nThey have to protect their playground -LRB- Bahrain -RRB- so that they can dodge the religious police back home in Saudi Arabia when they get in the party mood . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 4:33 pm | Shah , Turkey is not a trusted actor for reasons I discuss below . \nIn addition to those reasons Turkeys industrial is heavily tied to Qaddafi 's corrupt and repressive regime March 21 , 2011 at 4:34 pm | Being pro western and pro-Israel has nothing whatsoever to do with Libya 's murdering thousands of protesters , nor does it have anything to do with Yemen , Syria , and Bahrain murdering their citizens too . \nEnough already about Israel ! \nIsrael is not the country bombing and killing innocent civilians in Syria , Yemen , Libya , and Bahrain . \nIt is these Arab governments -LRB- that hate Israel , by the way -RRB- that are murdering their own people for no reason . \nDo you really believe the Arab world would be any freer if there was no Israel ? \nStop using Israel as an excuse for the dictators and madmen of the Arab world . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 4:49 pm | March 21 , 2011 at 8:01 pm | The simple truth is that no one knows what to believe from a country where a `` dictator '' has full control over the state media . \nSome have actually been buying into his propaganda from the first day of the democratic protests which quickly turned into a civil was because Gadhafi was quick to change to game from democratic protests to civil war by firing on the demonstrators then creating a false narrative out of thin air about western and Al-Quada intervention . \nWhen you start believing in `` dictator '' media sources you begin to lose objectivity in favor of emotion , misinterpretations , overreactions and flat out lies . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 4:08 pm | Reply Using the same token , you are discarding any information coming from Libyan sources . \nThe objectivity is not the aim of western news resources either . \nThe news food we are being served is to help justify the action taken -- or to be taken -- by the west . \nThis goes back to Gadhafi 's strategy , same strategy . \nWhat happens , in the end , is that we believe what we want to believe . \nMarch 22 , 2011 at 10:33 am | The Arab League is a precarious bunch of manure perched on a fence and likely to fall on either side . \nThe western governments were foolish to seek the blessing of this group in order to act on stopping Gadhafi . \nThe Arab League is not trusted by even the Arabs . \nMany of the men who make up this body are themselves sitting within governments who are being protested by their populaces . \nNo legitimacy is to be had among the coalition of western countries by accepting approval from this body which would predictably be rescinded within days . \nThe Arab League was fully knowledgeable about the United Nations wording and should get out of the game of diplomacy if they are going to straddle the fence on any given day . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 4:15 pm | Reply Right on Cindy . \nYou might add that the `` western '' powers have again been seduced into a charade which wil ultimately be used by ALL Arabs , sunni , shia , whatever , as an attack on Islam . \nWe need to liquidate every president and the boards of directors of every western oil company . \nThis would ensure that inappropriate pressure was removed from the political scene . \nThe Moslem lack of enthusaism for this thing reveaals the ultimate goal of the uprisings . \nIslamists are behind the entire project . \nA very dire future awaits us . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:37 pm | Maybe the Arab League approval provided the necessary cover to finally act . \nOnce action was taken , there is no such thing as the Arab Leaque saying `` well we really did n't mean it '' , or some variation on that theme . \nWhat I am personally a little surprised about is Great Britain . \nAfter release of the Lockerbie bomber on `` humanitarian grounds '' -LRB- how in the hell does that even come into consideration given the mass murders this guy committed ? -RRB- \n, which I am convinced was done to assist BP and for no other reason , it looks like BP does n't matter . \nOr , perhaps it really is a long term gambit on the part of BP , with the thinking being that Libya is going to be a mess anyway , getting rid of Gadhafi -LRB- whether he leaves , the opposition kills him , or a cruise missle manages to find him is irrelevant to the equation -RRB- , and BP is still in a prime position to make the most of the rebuilding while working with whoever turns out to be in control -LRB- and you just know that whoever does run Libya is going to seek to capitalize on the oil , just as Gadhafi has done -- so why not be in the best position possible when that happens ? -RRB- . \nMarch 22 , 2011 at 5:32 pm | I am from Lebanon and I strongly disagree with Shah below . \nTurkey is not exactly a trusted actor by the region 's residents . \nTurkey is actually in violation of more UN resolutions than any other country , there is the open question of its brutal repression of the Kurds . \nIts own military though bloated and having undue and unhealthy political influence and interests , is untested in battle with the exception of killing huge numbers of civilians . \nAnd the tactical `` bombing '' is part and parcel of a no-fly zone . \nNo one in Egypt , Libya or Turkey was complaining when Yugoslav was bombed during its civil war to create no-fly zones . \nIn terms of Bianca above , not much US intervention is needed in Japan . \nThe US sent a bunch of ships to help with logistics , but the real need arising form the earthquake in Japan is addressing nuclear safety long term . \nAll energy has hidden costs and dangers . \nEvery mine disaster , oil spill and nuclear accident points to the same

'' even after giving a speech insisting there will be no mercy and no compassion for those who fight against him , etc. . \nBut we 'll deal with it as we must . \nJust hopefully something materialises , which will help expose Gadhafi 's nonsense for what it is , and wo n't serve to offer credence to his propaganda here . \nAnd I wish some would stop bringing up the oil in the media as well . \nI could n't give a flying f - about the oil right about now . \nThere 's other deposits in the world . \nSome matters really should be tabled and given a back seat until more pressing matters are met . \nOnce the people have a country and a future , some matters can be negotiated then ; and in a way where they 'll have the money to help build themselves up . \nNow is just not the time , and it is n't the time where it 's even important . \nIt should be left for the day after , not the pressing consideation that 's on people 's minds today , where people ca n't even be safe from being rounded up and shot , right in their own homes ...

Why ? \nThey are talking about attacking teh French airforce ... Really ? \nThey deny the right to Kurds to have their own country ... 40 million people without a country ! \nThey are in violation of a number of EU chapters ... Why ? \nThey are still occupying a large portion of the Republic of Cyprus -LRB- EU member state -RRB- Why ? \nThey are in violation of not implementing a plethora of UN resolutions . \nThey are in denial of the extermination of millions of Armenians . \nThey are constantly provoking Greece into a war . \ni. Turkey did n't have to fight in WWII , they need n't show what military skills they had acquired in order to serve whatever their hidden agenda proposes -LRB- reference to US goals -RRB- . \nAfter all , Germans were the allies for a century , and were the Soviets thanks to a heroic WWI defense . \nTurks did not need to oppress the so-called minorities -- in contrast , they needed to embrace every prime citizens to build up fast ; the country was economically bleeding and most of their citizens were killed or injured after WWI -- since the country was not industrialized the human loss had been extreme . \nThe number of churches in Turkey exceeds that of the Rome ... sometimes it is forgotten perhaps , but Turks believe they have already contained the Christian teachings -- it may be altered , but not devilish to them . \nReligious talks against Turkey has never been a fruitful and great idea -- believe me . . \nTurkey has warned Israel over their uncontrolled actions , yes , threatened them ? \nTurkey , unlike Israel is part of multinational organizations of any kind , and can be checked , controlled , praised or blamed . \nIsrael is an abomination in this regard , roaming freely unchecked , because they feel they were isolated . \nTurkey offers them to break off this isolation in the language no others tried . \nNo one knows the issues that include Jerusalem , Palestine and Israel as Judaism any more and any better than Turkey . \nv. Yes , Turkey has no intention for giving up their own legitimate right of doing so no matter what -- they had to silence Greece and intervene the military coupe they gone out of control on the island ; the island has an extremely valuable location since it gives the owners an overseer position above the Suez channel and control over all East Mediterranean . \nUnder normal circumstances Greece would thank to Turkey for their intentional helps over the coupe , their EU and NATO memberships , I suppose they did n't . \nTurks should stop provoking their mighty neighbors or they may once again feel like conquering all the way to ancient Persia . \nthe deaf population in Turkey is around 2,5 million , Turkey , in total , is nearing 80M dynamic population . \nTurkey did not stay neutral as the Serbians attacking Bosnians , who had been a major contributor to their civilization , thus , culturally tied population , as they will not stay neutral while their 10b $ prospected marketplace is getting bombed by a rival nation . \nTurkey has completed a major evacuation from the country , and has sent 5 ships and one sub marine , vix . \nInteresting point of view that suggests Turks are somehow related to the protestants and other churches , just not to those your parents were used to take you . \nWe also raise a vampire race and have finest selection of other breeds FYI . \nx. I fail to see any supportive arguments why Turks , not even Turkey have not been trust worthy , though respecting your own faith on this subject , I understand Red and White are not favorite color combination . \nWith all respect , I do not believe Egypt has any kind of control over their own territories . \nThis is the very same reason why Turks have ruled the Northern Egyptian territories and the Channel , but not `` conquered '' the land or stayed on foreign soil as invaders . \nEgyptians are loved in Turkey , they have the resources , but they are not left alone , and Turks do not pay a role in this I 'm afraid . \nIn my opinion , Turkey is a solid country whose words and potential friendship or partnership should be credible enough . \nDo not be surprised if one of these days Turks start flying over Libyan cities to intercept French vultures should they continue acting upon their own will . \nBest regards ; March 23 , 2011 at 8:36 pm | Reply You get credit for recognizing that Alexander the Great was 100 % Greek . \nAs far as your comments ...

Is that another Turkish quality ? \nSteal others identities and spread mis-information ? \nWriting fake Mike is not about nationatity and is not about being Turkish !! If there was another discussion about other subjects , maybe a German or an South African would do the same , you can not know !!!!! 2 . \nFor this question , I think every country does it . \nTrade and showing reaction about diffirent situations are different aspects !!! 3 . \nEvery country has patriots who think and aim to destroy something which is owned by other countries . \nI am sure a person who lives in Iraq might want to destroy all the things which come from the west if his father were klled by Western forces ... Think about that ... !!!! 4 . \nYou may be right about this subject but I have just researched Turkish election done in 2007 and in this election , BDP which supports right of Kurds and advocates PKK organization which is considered as terrorist group by EU has just taken the 5 % of the all votes in Turkey . \nI means that 95 % of the people in Turkey do not want a Kurdish Territory in their homeland . \nAnd There is Kurdish TV and Kurdoloji studies and Kurdish language courses at Turkish universities ... 5 . \nI think it is good for a country to be able to say no about what you say to do as you think that it is not good for country 6 . \nI also researched about Cyprus past and there was an ANNAN PLAN which was refused by Greek part There is no need to tell about the war , massacres from two sides . \nIt is a well known story for all wars . \nWe all know that Israel does not obey UN rules . \nI think Armenians and Turkish historins must search all together in a neutral comission . \nAs far as I know Armenians refused that . \nGreeks spent a lot of money for military developments , that 's why there is an economical crisis . \nFor this subject , it is the guilt of not Only Turks but also Greeks . \nI reseached that Greeks had tried to occupied anatolia and there were two massacres from each side ... did you do any research through legit sources or you get all your information from the Turks ? \nTurkey is in violation of more UN resolutions than any other country . \nThe geneocide against Armenians and the Turkish denial about this geneocide is one example of why Turkey can not be trusted . \nInvading small Nations -LRB- Cyprus 1\\/2 million people -RRB- vs Turkey -LRB- 70 some million -RRB- , using Napalm bombs , killing and raping unarmed citizens and now they want to establish a separate country ? \nThat is another example why Turks have zero credibility . \nMarch 26 , 2011 at 6:14 pm | Bias , bias , bias ... I also know that Armenians must prove that , as I wrote , it is not about nationality , for example , think that American or French parliments decide there was a genocide against Armenians , as we know , parlimenters are not historians-at least all of them - , they are businessman and something like that and Armenian political lobbies say them to vote about accepting there was a genocide , then Parliments decide there was a genocide !!!!!!!!!!!! We need scientific evidences , dont we ? \nIf they prove also , it is not a guilt of existing Turks , as I researched in the internet that Kurdish gangs had tried to exterminate Armenian people . \nI wish nobody would have been killed in anywhere . \nFor UN , we can not count how many people die all over the Africa and we can hear almost nothing from UN . \nSo UN is not a good example for us !!!!!!!!!!! I will not write more ... I actually agree with you on the point that killings and injustices are happening all over . \nUnfortunately The USA and friends choose and pick which are worthy to help and which are not . \nKuwait was worthy , Iraq was worthy , x-Yugoslavia was worthy , and now Libya . \nThe massacres at Darfur apparently was not good enough for international intervention , the Turkish invasion of Cyprus apparently was not good enough for international intervention ... . \nWhere there is oil there is interest -LRB- x-Yugoslavia was an odd one ... since there is no oil -RRB- ... . . \nInterests above all ...

Times journalists arrive in Tunisia after being freed in Libya Stephen Farrell , from left , Tyler Hicks , Ambassador Levent Sahin Kaya , Lynsey Addario , and Anthony Shadid pose on Monday . \nFour New York Times journalists who were reported captured by pro-government forces in Libya last week have been released and have arrived safely in Tunisia , Executive Editor Bill Keller said Monday in an e-mail obtained by CNN . \n`` We 're particularly indebted to the Government of Turkey , which intervened on our behalf to oversee the release of our journalists and bring them to Tunisia , '' Keller said in the e-mail , which was sent to New York Times staff . \n`` We were also assisted throughout the week by diplomats from the United States and United Kingdom . '' \nEarlier Monday , Turkish Ambassador to Libya Levent Sahin Kaya said the four journalists had arrived at the Turkish Embassy in Tripoli . \nThe newspaper identified the journalists as Anthony Shadid , its bureau chief in Beirut , Lebanon , and a two-time Pulitzer winner for foreign reporting ; Stephen Farrell , a reporter and videographer who was kidnapped by the Taliban and rescued by British commandos in 2009 ; Tyler Hicks , a staffer who is based in Istanbul and has served as an embedded journalist in Afghanistan ; and photographer Lynsey Addario , who has covered the Middle East and Africa . \nIn a statement Monday , the newspaper said : `` We are grateful that our journalists have been released , and we are working to reunite them with their families . \nWe have been told they are in good health and are in the process of confirming that . \nWe thank the Turkish , British , and U.S. governments for their assistance in the release . \nWe also appreciate the efforts of those in the Libyan government who helped secure the release this morning . '' \nThe four journalists entered the rebel-controlled eastern region of Libya via the Egyptian border without visas to cover the civil war in the country , the Times said . \nThey had been missing since Tuesday , according to the Times , but Keller said in his e-mail that the four `` were allowed to speak to their families by phone Thursday night '' and that the government had informed the newpaper Thursday afternoon that they would be freed . \n`` Because of the volatile situation in Libya , we 've kept our enthusiasm and comments in check until they were out of the country , '' Keller wrote , `` but now feels like a moment for celebration . \nAnd before long we 'll all know the details of their experience .

{"id": "34", "time": "2011-03-21", "text": "The U.S. military has led the initial allied air attacks against Moammar Gadhafi 's forces in Libya , which began this weekend . \nSomething about it reminds me of the way the war in Iraq started eight years ago . \nThe U.S.S. Barry launches a Tomahawk missile . \nBut President Barack Obama insisted at a news conference this afternoon that the U.S. will soon step aside and that the mission will then be controlled by NATO forces and other allies . \nIt was the first time the president has answered questions on the topic of Libya since allied airstrikes began Saturday . \nRepublicans have sharply criticized Obama and his administration for the way they 've communicated about the U.S. military mission in Libya . \nHouse Speaker John Boehner says he supports helping the people of Libya , but he also says : `` Before any further military commitments are made , the administration must do a better job of communicating to the American people and to Congress about our mission in Libya and how it will be achieved . '' \nSen. Richard Lugar , the ranking Republican member of the Foreign Relations Committee , echoed Boehner 's concerns , telling CNN 's John King he does n't understand the mission either and believes there are no guidelines set for success . \nIt 's not a partisan issue so far . \nA group of liberal House Democrats held a conference call Saturday because they 're pretty upset that Congress was n't formally consulted before the U.S. and allies attacked Gadhafi 's forces . \nThey are concerned that involvement in the airstrikes could lead to a third war in the Middle East in which the U.S. is involved . \nU.S. Rep. Dennis Kucinich , D-Ohio , even raised the prospect of impeachment over the president 's actions . \nHere s my question to you : What is your understanding of America 's role in the Libya offensive ? \nInterested to know which ones made it on air ? \nThe mission is to give aid and stop the `` genocide '' of people who want to remove a dictator of 42 years who uses military force to stay in power . \nThe world ca n't sit by and watch one more war of attacks on innocent women and children . \nObama is so slowwwwwwww . \nIf Obama acted two weeks ago , Gadhafi would have been circled by his people and probably been taken out by his people . \nThe result now is where we were with Saddam in Iraq . \nNo fly zone for the next five years , while Gadhafi will be killing his own people . \nI just kind of figured it must have been some kind of a `` wage two wars , get a third war free '' promotion . \nWe get to spend the most money by using our expensive munitions to blast the command and control structure to hell , and the remaining countries get to practice their flying skills when it s safe to do so . \nIn other words , we bear the brunt of the expense , but no boots on the ground , so the President can say we are n't at war . \nGovernment by public relations campaign . \nMy understanding is that we will take control of Libya 's oil production to help bring down the price of gas in the U.S. . \nAfter that , we 're building a `` Disney : Middle East '' theme park on top of Gadhafi 's main compound . \nWe are there to clear the skies for England and France . \nOnce the air defenses are obliterated , we are in support . \nChange the name of the country Libya to Iraq . \nChange the year 2011 to 1992 . \nChange the name Obama to Bush . \nThe bottle might look different but the wine is still the same . \nPresident Hillary Clinton has stated our position . \nShe is doing a great job while her subordinates travel and play golf . \nI think we need to quickly get all military out of all cities ... except Tripoli . \nPut the fear of death into all military that if they are seen in a military vehcile outside of Tripoli , then they are a target . \nthey isolate Ghadaffi , bring freedom to all the other cities . \nThen , the UN moves in to setup elections . \nTripoli becomes a deserted stand alone entity with no oil revenues and no other option except to get rid of Ghadaffi . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 1:32 pm | Not under the pretext he gave , of `` drumming up business for America '' . \nTake the recent example from Mexico ... the end result ... Mexican truckers can now haul to every part of the US ... ... precisely what the drug cartels wanted ! \nOur benefit ... . . \nmore of our citizens exposed to illegal drugs , on a daily basis . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 1:33 pm | It looks like Obama and Clinton are doing a fine job in polishing the U.S. image in the international community . \nWe must n't be seen as Islamo-phobe crusaders , and at the same time we must support the creation of democracy where it has never been . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 1:36 pm | The role of the US , should have been to support the international effort ... . \ninstead we have now been directly involved in acts of war , in spite of the intent to keep international fighters protected from anti-aircraft fire . \nWe do n't need another major mid east war . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 1:36 pm | Jack : The role or goal of the United States in Libya is : 1 . \nTo be apart of a coalition that protects the Libyans ; 2 . \nTo stop the Libyan Regime from killing its own people ; 3 . \nTo make sure no US Military Personnel are not on the ground ; 4 . \nTo obey the UN Resolution when dealing with the Libyan Regime . \nI left off the name of the leader of libya , because it is hands off by the coalition of nations . \nTo Bad !! March 21 , 2011 at 1:39 pm | That we are taking out their military might . \nThen stepping back and letting others take over . \nWhich is what I hope we do . \nAlthough the media is down playing the US military role `` We are the lead nation '' , directing everything from intelligence , to military targets and planes doing the bombing . \nSome in the media would have you believe that France or Britian are leading this movement . \nThat 's not true , the US spent over 1 million dollars this weekend to carry out this bombing mission . \nMarlene in Michigan March 21 , 2011 at 1:46 pm | I am an active support of President Obama but his action in the Libyan theater is wrong . \nThe united States always seem to pray on weaker nations with oil under pretexts . \nPresident Obama , like former President Bush is killing Arab . \nPresident Obama is killing Libyan and destroying their country in the name of human right when we all know it is to militarily overthrow the Libyan government . \nI do not like Gadhafi because he was instrumental in destroying Liberia and killing over 250 Liberian but going after him with superior military might is wrong . \nThe U.S. could easily assassinate him instead . \nIf president Obama is serious about stopping foreign leaders from massacring their own people , why his administration is not in the Ivory Coast , Bahrain , and Yemen ? \nWhy the United States is not enforcing the countless United Nations Resolutions against Israel for it long atrocities against the Palestinians ? \nAs an independent voter Obama lost my vote for any attempts on his part for the presidency in 2012 . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 1:49 pm | The way I understand it , we will be turning over the reins to NATO and taking a back seat in enforcing the no fly zone . \nI think that is a good idea . \nWe are already involved in two wars and a national debt that threatens our way of life . \nWe can not leave ourselves be sucked into another war . \nThere 's only so much a country can do and we have reached our limit . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 1:50 pm | America has the most sophisticated detection , monitoring , and jamming equipment in the world . \nWe will contribute that role and those services to the prevention of a Libyan massacre . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 1:50 pm | Most of our enemies have been our former friends . \nWe claim to be big on human rights and freedom , and we step-in to help others -LRB- or over-throw a government -RRB- but only when such actions do not significantly hurt our oil supplies . \nIf we treated all opressive governemtns the same , we would have attacked Iran , Saudi Arabia ... the list will seem never ending ... but we do n't . \nEither our policies are short-sighted , or we are just greedy for oil . \nIt seems like long as we can keep supplying the oil to our so called freedom loving citizens who have no morals and do n't care for human life in a distant land just as long as there is oil for them to waste -LRB- yes , waste , that is what we do in the US -RRB- . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 1:53 pm | I have n't got a clue Jack and I seriously doubt anybody in Washington does either . \nOn the other hand , it does provide our military with a great opportunity to try out some of our sophisticated weaponry . \nAs we ponder whether oil or civilian safety is the real motivation , it is a good time to remember the Lincoln Brigade and the gallant Americans who got personally involved in the Spanish Civil War . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 2:01 pm | My understanding of our role in Libya is that we have confirmed that we are not a country that follows the rule of law , particularly our own . \nThat we will protect the special interests in securing our sources of oil , and that `` doin ' Right ai n't got no end '' . \nFunny how we now follow the Captain Red Legs Rule of Law under Bush\\/Obama , ai n't it ? \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 2:04 pm | My understanding is that the President declared `` Gaddafi must go '' far too quickly , then had to wait far too long for the international support he needed . \nI hope it 's not too late for the rebels ' sake . \nThe upside is huge ; the downside is unthinkable . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 2:05 pm | Absolutely . \nThe Use is there to provide its unique capabilities in support of uN Resolution 1973 -- to protect Libyan civilians from being massacred by their own govt . \nThe USA is helping enforce international Law , after it was asked by the UN , the Arab League and the people of Libya . \nThis is multilateralism at its best , as promised by Candidate Obama -- now carried out by President Obama . \nAnyone who does not understand this has no business wasting public airwaves . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 2:12 pm | We provide the tomahawks , carriers , logisticsand funding . \nWe take all the blame in the eyes of the arab world . \nEurope get 's all the ultimate benefit . \nDoes that sound about right to you Jack ? \nHave you ever noticed how the Arab League or OPEC never want 's to take care of these guys ? \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 2:19 pm | No I do n't and furthermore I think the President has been persuaded to do something his instincts told him not to . \nThe problem with any decision politicans make is they are all tainted with the question : What does this mean for my re-elction ? \nI know it 's human nature to think in self promoting terms but I 'd like to see a few decisons made based on what is the right thing to do without the cloud of `` holding on to an office '' swaying the decison . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 2:23 pm | Ken from PInon Hills , California Because there is oil under the ground in Libya . \nOil makes thousands of products besides gasoline , plastics for instance . \nOur demand for oil is insatiable . \nPresident Carter warned us we would eventually have an energy crisis if we did n't conserve , drive slower , and make more efficient automobiles . \nThe next President , Ronald Reagan , a friend of big business , said ridiculous , and went so for as to having the solar panels Carter had installed on the roof of White House torn down . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 2:23 pm | Hey Jack , , your a reasonable man , , tell Wolf that the tribe in Bengazi do n't like the tribe in Tripoli , , never have and after watching regime change in egypt decided this was a good time to get rid of Kadafy Think of the countries involved with the Kadafy must go line , , Britian , France , Italy U.S. Canada , , All countries with week leaders seeking a stronger mandate from their people -LRB- hopefully -RRB- and are breaking Jimmy Carters rule No state sponsered terrorism . \nWhen you back one tribe against another , bomb Kadafy 's compound and send out the general who sayes we are not allowed to do that and I wo n't comment further on it , , with a big smile on his face . . \nsayes that it 's true Thats why Kadafy said to the reporter `` you do n't understand this country or this war '' because it 's true . \nObama said he 's gotta go well when he goes you can take Cameron . \nSarkozey , and the rest with him because they are all liars as well keep up the good work Jack March 21 , 2011 at 2:29 pm | What is your understanding of America 's role in the Libya offensive ? \nThat in recognition that America is her brother 's keeper she is uniting with other nations who think as herself to defend them and not going alone . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 2:34 pm | We get to spend the most money by using our expensive munitions to blast the command and control structure to hell , and the remaining countries get to practice their flying skills when its safe to do so . \nIn other words , we bear the brunt of the expense , but no boots on the ground , so the President can say we are n't at war . \nGovernment by public relations campaign . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 2:35 pm | Obama is so slowwwwwwww . \nIf Obama acted 2 weeks ago Gadaffi would have been circled by his people and probably been taken out by his people . \nThe result now is where we were with Sadam in Iraq . \nNo fly zone for the next 5 years , while Gadafi will be killing his own people . \nBasically we have another Iraq turning back 10 years ago . \nIt shows that Obama is a rookie . \nI think Hillarry would have done a better job as President in this case . \nVote for Hillarry or Romney in 2012 . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 2:39 pm | Our role is to not think we own the world and need to intervene to solve all the problems every nation has . \nWe are not , nor should we be , the worlds ' police force . \nIf the UN , in cooperation with Arab nations in the region , wants to do something , we should be just a small part of that . \nWe should not run the show and coerce anyone to do things our way . \nIt is n't our country or even our continent . \nIf we had a civil war would we want other nations to establish a no-fly zone and send in ground troops to seize the capitol ? \nI might agree to let Canada and Mexico send in troops , but only if they brought beer , chips and salsa . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 2:40 pm | My understanding of our Libyan offensive is that Obama feels it 's more important to fight for freedom in Libya than it is in Wisconsin , Ohio , and Michigan . \nHe 'd rather emobroil the United States in a tribal war in North Africa than face the fact that the real war is at home against Corporatism . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 2:44 pm | Simple -- dictate to yet another country how they should govern , force our will upon them and spend billions to destroy a third country while ignoring business at home . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 2:50 pm | Apparently we 're preventing Qaddafi 's forces from taking Benghazi and from killing civilians in general . \nNo regime change or nation-building . \nAlthough if a missile takes out Qaddafi himself I do n't think anybody will be too upset - his own son is licking his chops waiting to take control . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 2:51 pm | We need to be part of a joint effort to give a dictator oppressed country a chance to chart their own course & gain some respect by not being in the lead . \nI do wonder why the media does n't mention the abstentions in the security council from Russia & China . \nwe are the policeman of the world broke but china has a lot of money March 21 , 2011 at 2:56 pm | Our role in libya is to prevent ghadafi from defending his country against armed rebels who have decided to overthrow the libyian government by force . \nThe u.s. and coalition planes can kill pro-ghadafi civilians but not anti-ghadafi armed rebels who call themselves civilians . \nThis weekend u.s. antiwar protesters were arrested in DC for protesting against obama invading and bombing 4 countries : iraq , afghanistan , pakistan , and libya . \nRussia and China need to establish a no fly zone over the u.s. to protect anti-war protesters from being harassed and arrested throughout this so called democracy . \nIf you protest in the u.s. you will be beaten with clubs , sprayed with military tear gas classified as a chemical weapon , kicked in the groin , and arrested by the police . \nCivil rights and anti war protesters in the 1960 's were shot and killed by police and the national guard in this country . \nProtesters in this country need a u.n. resolution . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 3:05 pm | Even though this action was initiated by the French and British and approved by the U.N. Security Council our enemies will label this as a U.S. attempt to obtain Libya 's oil . \nIf the `` No-Fly '' mission is successful and the U.S. withdraws within a week the British and the French will take the heat . \nWorld opinion has already written off Gadhafi . \nIf the rebels do n't promptly suceed in removing the Gadhafi administration who will support the rebels in weapons and materials until they do ? \nWho is providing weapons and ammunition now ? \nMore questions than answers . \nDee in New Paris Ohio At this point my understanding is what `` they '' tell us . \nThat we are not going to be sending ground troops . \nThat we are only going to be actively involved for just a short time . \nBut what I really think is , if the rebels are successful in overthrowing Gadhafi , and if they establish a new government that is at all favorable toward the U.S. , and if they , in return for military help to maintain the new government , offer us a sweet oil deal , well DUH ! \nWe will be there FOREVER , just as we are seemingly in for the long haul in so many other countries ! \nIn other words , at this point I take whatever `` they '' tell us with a grain of SAND , with a little oil dressing on the side ! \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 3:17 pm | Allow the capitalists to line the entire Mediterranean with yachts and mansions . \nI will be moving to European side of the Mediterranean in a few more years and the fewer missiles the better , and I imagine that a large number of Arabs have plans to return to the Middle East eventually . \nHowever , I think we are going overboard with our `` Full Scale War '' against a country that has a Military that is equivalent to our Boy Scouts , but when you attack a country like this , you know before you start that you are going to win . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 3:18 pm | As I see it , our objective is twofold : Make more money for the oil cartels and defense contractors , and help the President kiss Republican butt . \nNeither bodes well for the American people . \nIt looks like we are sticking our noses into another Middle East problem . \nMaybe if President Obama was in the White House Press Room explaining it to the American people , we would have a better understanding as to why we are there at all . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 3:27 pm | Hard to ever have perfect understanding of what 's going on in today 's world ... unless you are Fareed Zakaria !!! And I am convinced that our President is very well aware of how different things are and is doing whatever he can to ensure we will continue to be its leader by earning respect ... not demanding it !! My understanding of the U.S role in the Libya civil war is to provide protection for Libya 's civilians and to provide cover for the opposition forces from air attacks from the Libyan government forces , and while it is not our primary goal , to ultimately facilitate the regime change that the world has long awaited . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 3:31 pm | My understanding is that the U.S must do all that it can to preserve the oil supply to the U.S from the middle east to ensure the continued economic recovery of our oil dependent economy . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 3:33 pm | Joe Ft Walton Bch Fl The offensive in Libya in the beginning was to help the rebels get the upper hands in their fight against Gaddafi , now the situation is different . \nThe rebels are not even closer than they were a week ago to win the fight , Gaddafi forces are advancing into Benghazi and the rebels will probably lose their ground defenses . \nNow the goal for the NATO forces is to take down Gaddafi and his sons , and the only way to do it is to send ground troops into Libya and finish the job . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 3:38 pm | Our role is to stop and ensure that agression is stoped . \nThis is almost a first if not the first time we the U.S. are not pulling all the strings and footing the full bill on an action that sadly is needed . \nMaybe people can lay off the French for a while after all they helped us in our fight for independance . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 3:40 pm | The United Nations and the coalition forces meaning France , United Kingdom , and the United States recognize a crazy mad man when they see and here one . \nAnd besides Gadhafi has been playing France the U.K. and the U.S. they have a bone to pick with him . \nWe are there as part of a larger coalition of UN forces to provide support . \nThe question is `` Why ? '' . \nWhat 's at stake for us . \nObama is allowing his foreign policy to be dictated by the UN and other outside influences . \nHis view is the US is an equal partner in global politics and believes in looking out for the collective good for the world . \nWhat he does n't seem to grasp is the American people expect him to look out for what is in the best interest of America . \nAnd most of the world feels they would be better if if the US was weak or hamstrung . \nLibya shows a total lack of leadership and direction in our foreign policy . \nIt 's the only way to explain the lack of action on Iran or Egypt but military assistance for Libya . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 3:45 pm | U have to support your alliesotherwise they wo n't support you . \nWho is supporting Ghadafi , the scum that support the terrorist that blew up a U S PAN AM PLANE IN THE 80 'S and PROBABLY SUPPORTED THE lie ABOUT THE bomber dying which caused the courts to release him to a cheering bloody crowd of supporters ! \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 3:50 pm | My understanding is that the U.S. and others are protecting the revolutionary Libyans , by providing no fly zones over Libya . \nHowever , I think the ultimate objective is to boot out Gadhafi , maintain optimum flow of oil , and impose our tenet over them whether they like it or not . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 3:51 pm | Our role is to provide air and ground support to the rebels trying to overthrow this madman . \nThe words `` take out his command and control '' is another way of saying `` we are after you Gaddafi '' . \nAs long as the allies control the skies , the rebels have a fighting chance . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 4:05 pm | Change the name of the country Libya to Irag . \nChange the year 2011 to 1992 . \nChange the name Obama to Bush . \nThe bottle might look different but the wine is still the same . \nNow what will anyone do in 2022 if Qadhafi is still in power and still murdering his people . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 4:05 pm | Tampa , Fl Easy one Jack , just look in your encyclopedia under Vietnam , N. Korea , Iraq -LRB- does n't matter which -RRB- and you will have your answer . \nWe go in , against the will of the American Taxpayer , offering just advise , along with a enough firepower to level the place , Then we `` stay '' , rebuild , spend billions of dollars , and never leave . \nOh , and we borrow all the money that our politicians spend on the whole thing . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 4:12 pm | I see our role as the same as when Iraq invaded Kuwait . \nWe are the head of an International posse-including some Arab states-who are going in to prevent inhumane acts . \nIt is a role we have taken in the past , and , as the sole super power , one we must not shirk now . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 4:14 pm | No. . \nI am a mushroom . \nI am kept in the dark & fed you know what . \nI think they are hoping to show a force in Libya hoping to knock him off but also to show the rest of the Arab world not to start at uprising cause this could happen to you . \nAnd Momar is like a rat they always scurry and hide when the heat comes on . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 4:15 pm | The mission is to give aid and stop the `` genocide '' of people who want to remove a dictator of 42 years and uses military force to stay in power . \nThe world ca n't sit by and watch one more war of attacks on innocent women and children . \nBad enough they are taking away women 's rights here if we let em . \nNo more tyrants OPPRESSING families and citizens . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 4:17 pm | the reason for us to be involved in action in libya is to protect the people from a slaughter by a mad man . \nthe press or media seem to be a shield for the mad man . \nWhy Jack ??? March 21 , 2011 at 4:19 pm | My understanding of this mess is that we are headed for a third war ! \nOur military will never get to come home ! \nWhy was congress NOT consulted ? \nCould we have done something else before we started throwing bombs ? \nWhat is Mr. Nobe PEACE Prize 's answer to that ??? March 21 , 2011 at 4:20 pm | Phil in Los Alamitos , California America 's role is to do the heavy lifting as always . \nAll the talk of a ` coalition ' is nonsense . \nKeep in mind that the whole point of this exercise is to keep Ghadhafi in power and to keep Saudi Arabia from turning over . \nThe world economy needs to keep the oil flowing and can not afford any potential disruption . \nThis is about helping these countries put down the rebellions while harming as few citizens as possible in order to maintain what little stability exists . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 4:23 pm | The US is working on shedding the image that we do whaterver we want and buffalo the world into accepting . \nThis i mage has made us unpopular with friend anf foe alike . \nIn Lybia we are stanging out of the limelight . \nMost of te air strikes have been conducted by others . \nIt seems evident the the military effort is going beyond a no-fly zone and that substantil damage is being inflicted on Gadalfi 's forces . \nThis has been a good start and hopefully the initative will be successful . \nThen we find out what the opposiion is really about . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 4:25 pm | Good question . \nWhy are we doing anything ? \nWhat difference will it make other than add even more wood to the Great Satan hatred held by just about every Muslim in the -LRB- at least -RRB- the Middle East for the US ? \nWe 're damned if we do and damned if we do n't so let 's do n't for a change . \nLet the rest of the world worry about things . \nI 'm tired of it . \nFirst Afghanistan , which Bush screwed the pooch on when he decided to -LRB- second -RRB- invade Iraq . \nWe 've lost far too many American 's for the Neo-con dream of `` democracy '' in the Middle East . \nWhich , by the way , why is the GOP being so cautious ? \nWhere were they in 2003 and 2001 ? \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 4:25 pm | My understanding is we 're at war , on at least a third front now -LRB- if you do n't include Pakistan -RRB- . \nThe Military Industrial Complex must be joyous . \nHowever , the media ca n't even get the story right . \nI 've read two versions : NATO approved it , and France started the initial attack , or the US attacked with the backing of their allies . \nI guess journalism in the US these days means just making stuff up and letting us guess what the truth is . \nNo wonder Americans are turning to the BBC , Al Jazeera , and der Spiegel for real news . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 4:26 pm | People on the left and right kept screaming do something to help the people of Libya . \nEven though it seems like we entered this commitment in the dark of night and it felt a little clandestine , we are stepping up to the plate with many allies . \nIt 's not like we could tell France and Great Britain to wait a minute while we get President Obama back from Brazil and Congress back from break to vote on this thing . \nWe made the original committment when we took the matter to the U.N. No turning back now . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 4:27 pm | Take the oil out of these wars and the dollar would fall flat in a week . \nThis is about propping up the petro-dollar system so that our currency remains the reserve currency of the world . \nWithout this action the dollar would be worthless to pay our debts , and America would slide into hyperinflation . \nI am not being snarky , it 's just the sad state we are in . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 4:28 pm | Watching the news I am afraid we are much more deeply involved in this tribal civil war than we were originally told . \nI thought we were in a supporting role to the French -LRB- The FRENCH ?!? -RRB- who were supposed to take the lead in establishing the NFZ . \nNow it looks like our role is to spend millions of dollars we do n't have on fuel and munitions to piss off more Muslims in another open-ended conflict . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 4:28 pm | I believe that our role is to assist in and support the UN resolution for a no fly zone as part of an allied coalition . \nNot to lead an invasion or remove a regime , but to proceed as needed to ensure that human rights are not violated as the process unfolds . \nAnd every issue that invloves Obama is partisan , Jack . \nGive us a break . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 4:31 pm | james s lenon chuckey tn My understanding was that we would provide targetting information and AWAC guidance and Command\\/Control . \nNow we appear to be launching and dropping ordnance . \nThe Arab League is now unhappy that we 're providing what they asked for . \nSomeone should have told them that bombast and duplicity are not parts of our arsenal . \nStand our troops down and let the Arab League create and maintain a no fly zone . \nThat will be the day . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 4:31 pm | My understanding is that the American mission is designed to use up as many rockets as possible in the shortest time in order to bolster the military industry back home . \nIt must be the government 's view that nothing says domestic economic recovery so powerfully and quickly as destroying America 's supply of existing rockets now in Libya in order to make way for the next generation of military toys to roll off the assembly line . \nMeanwhile , in Florida , twenty percent of homes fester in vacancy , and education spending must be cut drastically in every State . \nOsama Bin Laden must be laughing in his cave . \nLibya certainly looks like another nail in America 's fiscal coffin . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 4:34 pm | Jack to be perfectly honest I have stopped trying to understand what politicians in Washington are doing or what roll America is playing in foreign policy . \nLibya is going to be another Iraq and we will be stuck there in one form or another for decades to come just like Iraq and now Afghanistan . \nMore Americas will be killed for some other countries freedom and I am getting a little sick of that fact . \nAmerica is broke and any money we spend on Libya has to be borrowed from some other country that we will never be able to pay back . \nAmerica has become a debtors prison for our children their children and any offspring they may ever have . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 4:34 pm | My understanding of this war is we go in blow up and destroy the libyan army and get out . \nI also understand that we have now three wars in islamic nations where we have superior arms . \nMy question to you jack is what happens when china or russia crackdown on their people for trying to change the govt ? \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 4:35 pm | Jack , I can hardly believe that the UAE , now after the resolution 1973 is passed with it 's stated intent , question and even complain that the air strikes are excessive and that they did n't know that this would be involved ! \nAre you kidding me ! \nThese supposedly intelligent people did n't know that you just ca n't put planes in the air without taking out the weapons that could shoot them down ! \nWhat are they smoking ! \nOr , maybe it is ok to just begin flying over Libya and get shot down ! \nAnd , as far as I 've heard , everyone wants him to stop the killing & or step down . \nBut , he 's not doing either ! \nIsraeli PM Netanyahu called him , he 's been friendly with them for years , did n't return the call . \nWhat do you do ? \nWell , that 's what the UN resolution was all about ! \nAnd as much as it is not being said , him being made deceased is an option -- since he wont leave or stop is destruction of innocent civilians . \nAs for these some of these congressmen , they must be smoking the same stuff as the Arabs -- oh we want him to leave but let 's not do anything drastic while he slaughter 's folks ! \nOh my word -- to do or not to do or to backpedal ! \nThe bottom line , since the resolution has been passed : Do the no flyover thing , monitor , and let the people decide which way and what they want to do with Gadhafi . \nOh and stop putting the blame on POTUS for all the world 's ills ! \nNurse Lisa in Shelton CT Not much , since their official story is n't yet out and there has been no bipartisan analysis explaining how it is either the greatest vs. worst move ever . \nFor those worried about a lack of a stated plan -- it is probably the same as GWBs -- `` we 'll smoke 'em out ! '' \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 4:39 pm | Our role in Libya is to help the Libyan people by destroying Qaddafi 's ability to continue killing his own people . \nWe 're enabling the people to get rid of Qaddafi themselves . \nThere is NO comparison to Bush 's invasion of Iraq based on lies . \nThe Libyan people are THANKING the countries helping them , which includes the U.S. . \nIt 's 180 degrees from what Bush did , so if this reminds you of Iraq , you do n't have a very good memory . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 4:41 pm | My understanding is this : We will do the bulk of the military action , suffer the bulk of lost lives , and we will be paying for this new fiasco forever . \nMy understanding is the US is part of a coalition of nations taking this action in accordance with UN resolution 1973 . \nI do n't think it 's bad -- I hope the dictator is driven out -- that should be the objective -- or it could become a long , drawn out action . \nApparently everyone 's forgotten Reagan 's attack on Libya . \nThe dictator was slaughtering his own people . \nHow can anyone with a conscience allow this to happen ? \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 4:47 pm | As an Arab American , i strongly oppose US involvement in Libya ; i would like to see Qadafi leave more than anyone , but not through our direct involvement , Supporting the revolutionist with Qadafi 's money that we have seized sounds like a great idea , Any military involvement does not have a success scope . \nThere is no success for this mission , Qadafi will not leave until forced to , and that wo n't be accomplished by air strikes March 21 , 2011 at 4:50 pm | My understanding is that we will take control of Libya 's oil production to help bring down the price of gas in the U.S. . \nAfter that , we 're building a `` Disney -- Middle East '' theme park on top of Gadhafi 's main compound . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 4:51 pm | Our role is to take a back seat and just help support our friends , France and England , do all the work ... We support by suppling the major weapons to be used as well ... Basically , we are , as usual , the major player but we do n't have the political will power to admit it ... We support the shock while others support the awe ... March 21 , 2011 at 4:51 pm | We ca n't be everything to everyone . \nThis is a legit revolution and we need to stay out of it . \nLet the Arab league intervene and mediate if necessary . \nToo many of our good men and women are dying in the mid east and for what ??? Oil , thats what !! If Libya did n't have oil we could ' t care less about them March 21 , 2011 at 4:52 pm | What is your understanding of America 's role in the Libya offensive ? \nOurs is a support role . \nWe are not in a leading role . \nWe are not going to send ground troops and if Gadhafi and\\/or his fruitloop son end up dead , oh well . \nIt is the will of the people . \nToo bad the Brits missed . \nThe end result must be a benefit to some social program ; otherwise , Obama would n't have us involved . \nT. Masters , Greenville , SC March 21 , 2011 at 4:53 pm | Seems we still fail to learn from history -- even very recent history . \nThere 's no vital national interest at stake in Libya so we should not attempt to pick a winner in a struggle internal to the people of Libya . \nYes , Gaddafi is a creep , but are we so sure that the folks who take over will be our friends ? \nOr will the rebels -LRB- Islamic radicals -RRB- turn their hate towards us as the Taliban did ? \nWill we ever learn our lesson ? \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 4:54 pm | Jack , my understading of the US role in Libya is to join Countries , with the approval of the UN , the Arab League , and others to prevent genocide by Gadhafi of his own people . \nThis is a temporary intervention , not particularly led by the US , since France sent airplanes first . \nThe people being murdered begged for help , and now they are getting it . \nThis is not declaration of war , and Kucinich is running scared for his next election , and Boehner , and others just want to criticize . \nFirst they say he should do this , then he waited too long , now why did n't he dicuss it with every John , Eric , and Dennis so they could waste time touting their personal importance . \nImpeach them for not doing their jobs . \nWhat a There was n't much understanding prior to the attacks beginning . \nAfter military action began it was to hault Libya from taking over the rebels strong holds and to save lifes . \nIt looks like we have done that . \nBut , what 's next . \nWill there be a standoff ? \nIs there another plan in the works ? \nI do n't feel very comfortable with this leadership , or the lack of ... . . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 4:55 pm | My understanding is , that we under a UN resolution and would try to stop Gadhafi from killing civilians . \n, France , Britain , and other nations would help in doing so . \nOnce that is achieved , we would patrol the area , and impose the no fly zone , until we can be sure that the indiscriminate killing of civilians could not be accomplished . \nAnd that is all that we are required to do . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 4:56 pm | I do n't think anyone really knows what is going on . \nIt seems clear that the French rushed through the no-fly zone resolution to stop Benghazi from being wiped off the map and save the revolution . \nWith that now done it does n't seem that anyone has much of an idea about what will happen next . \nWar always puts civilians in danger , no matter which side attacks . \nWill the coalition also strike the rebels if they commit atrocities ? \nare they just after Gadhafi ? \nOr do they just want to create a balance that will force the various sides to the negotiating table ? \nToo many gray areas and no clear objectives . \nI suspect this will be a long one . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 4:57 pm | before I forget , I thought the Executive Branch could only go to war with the express permission of the Legislative Branch ? \n-LRB- Congress -RRB- When was Congress consulted and when did the vote granting the President the authority to go to war take place ? \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 4:57 pm | My take is that the stability in Libya is gone . \nWe need to help protect the flow of oil to Europe . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 4:58 pm | Same as it has been for many decades ; De-stabilize a Muslim country , protect Israel , take one dictator down to install another . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 4:58 pm | This is ridiculous . \nI 've listened to what the President has said about the US mission in Libya ... and I understood exactly what he was saying . \nMaybe those who do n't want to understand whats being said need to start listening more carefully and stop inventing their own versions of what is going on based on some insane need to create alarm . \nAnd as far as political critics are concerned ; if Obama were Republican the Congress would be praising his every move , talking about his courageous action toward saving our shores from terrorists or some other worn out lie . . \nMaybe he needs to land on a carrier somewhere and declare ... President Obama is in a no-win situation here . \nHe was being heavily criticized for doing nothing and permitting the slaughter of civilians . \nNow that he has intervened , he is being criticized for starting the 3rd war in an Arab country . \nAs long as it is a measured response within the bounds of the UN resolution , and the US gets out fairly quickly , I believe he will have pursued the best course . \nFrom my point of view , the role of the US in Libya is to prevent more civilian casualties as well as prevent Gadhaffi 's regime from using military equipment to kill anti government protesters ; that was the consensus of the United Nations and should be respected . \nThe decision of the US along with other Europeans nations of dismantling Gadhaffi s arsenal would allow anti-government opponents to continue focusing their efforts in implementing a more democratic government in Libya . \nMy understanding is we wanted to quickly halt the military to prevent further harm to the citizens of Libya . \nBy doing this , we can enable them to hold their ground and continue the liberation of their country without much outside help . \nThe U.S. specifically delivered the brunt of the initial attacks on military targets to pave the way for the rest of the coalition which will handle the situation once control is handed over shortly . \nIf this is indeed what happens , I 'm in full support . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:02 pm | Remo , from beautiful downtown Pflugerville Texas Why Libya ? \nThere is so much genocide going on in Africa , why are we stopping it in Libya ? \nOr are we just interested in oil and not humanity ? \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:03 pm | I have mixed emotions about this although Gadhafi is an absolute mad man bent on destroying his opposition , but at the same time Washington is saying nothing about the Saudi crackdown in Bahrain and other territories where they are killing innocent protesters . \nLooks like Washington has different standards for different countries depending on our friendship and alliances . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:05 pm | We were very informed about the reason for Iraq war ; but if I 'm not mistaken , the information given was misleading . . \nWe cant solve every countrys problems , even really bad ones . \nI hope the U.S. will get the heck out of what we have no business being in , but at the same time , the pots are calling the kettle black ... March 21 , 2011 at 5:05 pm | My and many of americans understanding is simply three prioritys of this Libya Offensive . \nProtect the oil feilds from being destroyed by Gadhafi 2 . \nProtect the people of Libya from being murdered by their leader . \nFinish former President Ronald Reagans offensive against Gadhafi by bombing his residence in hopes he is their at the time counting his millions This is what we signed up for after world war ll , being world police . \nWe as Americans have the solem duty of protecting the weak throughout the world . \nThe day we stop protecting the weak is the day we are weak ourselves . \nI am amazed that so few people heard Obama , on television last Saturday tell the American people that America was a part a colition that would establish -LRB- with others -RRB- a no fly zone over Libya . \nAnd , there would be NO American ground troops involved . \nThis was after much criticism that we did n't act sooner . \nI for one am glad that other nations are also involved Our missle strikes seem to be necessary for the safety on pilots supporting the no-fly mandate March 21 , 2011 at 5:05 pm | Unless Gadaffi is deposed what is the point of this operation ? \nSo either he is eliminated or this is a waste of effort March 21 , 2011 at 5:06 pm | Yeah ... too bad we could n't get George Tenet to give us a high five `` Slam Dunk '' assessment before we went in ... would that keep Lugar and Boehner happy ? \nAnyway you slice it , we are getting involved we where have no business getting involved ... the last few days have seen the attempts of a cover up by the administration in saying that Ghadafi is capable of terrorism so we must act . \nWhat about the gunning down of unarmed women in Cote ` de Ivoire last week or the gunning down of protesters in Bahrain ... The fact is that whether you are DEM or a REPUB ... both parties are leading us down a path to disaster and there is apparently no way out for the average citizen who wants them to focus on America 's issues and not the issues of everyone else . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:06 pm | Our govenrment says we are to provide support for the other countries involved after the initial strikes aginst Libya . \nWe are there to hopefully protect the Lybian People . \nI f we are not there to get rid of Gaddafi , what are we there for . \nWe say we are there to protect the people . \nIf the people are to be truely protected Gaddafi needs to go . \nOur mission in Libya is a purely humanitarian purpose and some how to remove the leader , now if by any chance a tomahawk hits him on the head that will acceptable . \nOnce war starts it can go either way , but in this case it will be over before we know it , Libya is not Iraq sir ! \nwe have people on the ground that have Moammar Gadhafi 's address it 's just a matter of time Sir ! \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:07 pm | Congress needs to get their collective heads out of their rear ends and stop questioning every move , or lack thereof , made by the President . \nSo far what I 've seen from Obama appears to be thoughtful , deliberate , and well-prepared action . \nTo hear it from members of Congress , either the action has been too hasty or not hasty enough . \nI 'm getting very tired of every member of Congress seeming to think their way is the only way . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:08 pm | Here 's my concern . \nHow much is actually known about the rebels our military forces are now protecting ? \nI agree the we should n't ever stand by and let dictators slaughter their own people ; yet we do it all the time when those regimes are considered our allies or friendly to the West . \nWhy , for example , are we doing nothing to stop the killing of protesters in Bahrain ? \nIs it because the regime is a U.S. ally and because of oil and other financial interests ? \nHow do we pick and choose where we will intervene in the brutal massacres of people by their own leaders , and where we will stand on the sidelines and shake our heads ? \nBut getting back to Libya , specifically what worries me is who and what will emerge once Gaddafi is gone . \nWe armed , aided , abetted , and actually created the Taliban in Afghanistan , believing that doing so was a way to thwart the Soviet Union . \nAnd look what we got . \nThe rebels we 're now supporting in Libya could well turn out to be radical fundamentalist Islamists dedicated to establishing a Taliban-style Islamic state in Libya . \nDoes anyone think such a state is going to be pro-Western or democratic ? \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:08 pm | So who else thinks US military action in Libya is insane ? \nI do n't dispute that Gadhafi is a ruthless dictator and is `` killing his people . '' \nBut does that make it okay for us to kill Libyans ? \nShould the Russians have intervened when the Ohio National guard killed students at Kent State 1970 ? \nWant to punish the ruler ? \nStop buying what he sells ... . . \nWe would n't need what he sells if we spent 1\\/10 the money we spend on offensive weapons on research into making alternative forms of energy more efficient . \nI ask our leaders to stop displaying the definition of insanity , i.e. , doing the same things over and over again and thinking it will have a different outcome ... How many of these `` wars '' do we have to get involved in before we figure it out ? \nWhen the Libyans want and are ready for democracy they need to make it happen themselves . \nUntil then , we should embody the `` prime directive , '' i.e. , do not interfere in the evolution of others . \nTo do that we have to absolutely not need anything from those whose behaviors we abhor . \nNote my statements here are regarding the internal affairs of sovereign nations . \nIf they strike outside their borders at us our our friends , we must strike back hard . \nBut no externally pressured regime change . \nThat is for internal evo - or revo-lution . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:09 pm | Seems to me that we are the most qualified to take out Libya 's air defenses before other countries send their planes on patrol in relative safety . \nRemember ` Shock & Awe ' ? \nWe 're pretty good at that . \nBut then we really do need to back up & let everyone else do their part . \nWe went it alone in Iraq , one of the most bone-headed decisions in modern times . \nI do n't really care if the President does n't inform the mealy-mouthed members of Congress -LRB- both parties -RRB- beforehand . \nThey would just whine and complain and jockey for political advantage no matter what he did . \nAs it is , the UN waited so long to approve this that Gadhafi was able to turn the whole situation in his favor . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:10 pm | YES to spend money we do not have , Tomahawk Cruise Missile cost 569,000 each 118 the first day and 4 more yesterday , that 122 so far 69,418,000 dollars in missile alone . \nRaython makes these missiles they are the same company that help the U.S. Navy shoot down a Iranian passenger plane killing all on board , women and children . \nThen we pay off Iran they pay Libya to take down one of ours . \nThis country has problems March 21 , 2011 at 5:10 pm | Sorry Jack , but I do n't see any similarity to Iraq at all . \nIraq did n't ask us or anyone else to interfere and the administration of the time lied to -LRB- or at least deliberately mislead -RRB- the American people about why we needed to be there . \nThe Lybians , on the other hand , have practically been begging the rest of the world to intervene . \nThey 're dying at the hands of a half-mad dictator and need help . \nIf anybody should have been impeached it should have been the president who illegally started the war in Iraq . \nWe did n't start the conflict in Lybia ; the U.N. simply responded to the cry for help from the Lybian people . \nNot the same alt all . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:11 pm | My understanding is this is a repeat of what happened when Clinton ordered US forces to join NATO in bombing Yugoslavia -- a dictator is clinging to power by going after his own people , and that 's when the UN steps in . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:11 pm | As I listened this weekend to CNN it was my understanding that ... this effort was with the UN backing . \nSince when do we the people interfere with the heads of state , NATO and the UN to question their procedures . \nDoes that make us thorns , in our own countries effort to help a country whose people are dying by the whim of a dictator . \nMy understanding is we have the big guns and the missiles , another has the ground forces , while others will pick up the bill ... And who are the Republicans to speak evil when their president went to war in the wrong country . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:11 pm | It 's interesting how Obama campaigned saying that he would start out his presidency with an immediate withdrawal of troops , and now we 've got more military involvement in more countries than we had under previous administrations . \nAside from that , the fact that the president is taking military action without consulting Congress or clearly communicating the situation to the American people is unacceptable . \nThis indicates his perception of the presidency as a dictatorial position rather than that of the chief executive . \nEven though I have been staunchly opposed to our actions in Iraq and Afghanistan , I greatly support action that stops a madman from slaughtering his own people with the help of foreign mercenaries . \nA repeat of the genocide in Srebrenica and Rwanda would be a tragedy . \nThis is what is happening in Libya according to the United States . \nA week ago -- Obama is not doing anything , hiding under the desk , supporting his Muslim brothers etc -- Whine whine whine Two days ago -- Obama bombed Libya -- how dare he , How arrogant etc Whine whine whine Yesterday -- Obama was too late in attacking Libya -LRB- John McCain -RRB- Whine whine whine Today -- How dare Obama attack Libya -- He should have got congressional approval Whine whine whine March 21 , 2011 at 5:11 pm | My understanding is that it is similar to France 's role in our American Revolution . \nHelp level the playing field so that the outcome of the revolution is determined more by what the majority of people in the country want than by who has the most tanks and gun ships . \nUnlike Iraq the Libyan people have shown that they do n't want their leader and are willing to fight for themselves to outser him . \nWe need only give them the level tactical playing field to do so . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:12 pm | The mission is to stop Gadaffi from killing his own people . \nWe are enforcing UN resolution 1973 . \nIf Gadaffi goes down in the process , that is all for the good . \nI have been paying attention closely to this Jack . \nI listen to the President , the Generals , and Sarkozy as well as Cameron . \nI go on line and read CREDIBLE news sources . \nI do NOT listen to pundits or politicos from either party . \nTheir ` agenda '' seldom has anything to do with passing on truth or wisdom . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:12 pm | The President was reluctant to involve the US in another military engagement , but was faced with the reality that Benghazi was about to fall and Libya would be left with a ruthless dictator who would continue to cause untold and continuing death and destruction upon his own people . \nI believe the limited engagement that the President has signed off on is in the best interests of the Libyan people while also beginning to restore the hope and faith that people of the world once held in the United States of America . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:12 pm | Is n't this the way it is suppose to be . \nWhen the UN undertook this mission , the French , the Arab countries , other countries of Africa and southern Europe should be at the forefront . \nFor too long , when somebody says UN action , it is the USA that is in the forefront , back front , sidefront , with token display from others . \nThis is what George Bush should have done in Afghanistan The President ca n't start a war without the approval of Congress unless there is an immediate threat to the US . \nObama graduated from Harvard Law and taught Constitutional law and he knows this . \nI do n't understand what he is trying to do . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:14 pm | Gaddafi is long overdue to be removed from power . \nIt is unfortunate that the strike in 1986 missed . \nHopefully we can complete that mission and honor Fernando L. Ribas-Dominicci and Paul F. Lorence for their sacrifice . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:14 pm | As someone that was born Muslim I 've heard your rhetoric before and its typical . \nLibya is messed up BECAUSE the Muslims in that country have done a poor job . \nThat 's an Arab problem -- like the entire Arab world . \nStop blaming America for all the Muslim worlds problems . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:14 pm | Hey maybe we can give them our Mulism anti-American leader and get rid of Gadafi at the same time . \nWe 'll straighten our country out and theirs at the same time . \nWe began our 3rd war over the weekend , like it or not ... our play book , we started it . \nWhat is confusing about that ? \nWe 're in it now ! \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:15 pm | I understand why we are involved with Libya ... we are doing what America has both verbally and through action always done ... we are defending those that ca n't defend themselves . \nWe are not in Libya to fight the battle for the rebels , but are there to defend the interests of those caught in the middle . \nPres. Obama has been a humanitarian from the very beginning and it is no surprise to me that he has gotten us involved here . \nI am glad to see that the plan is for us to step aside and let others lead the rest of this operation because everyone that is rushing in now left us with Iraq and Afghanistan on our own for the most part . \nI think that it is time for the world to be more involved with the task of `` policing the world '' that has tragically fallen on American shoulders for years . \nAlso , I think that getting out of the way and letting other countries lead the charge will potentially help remove the stigma that we are only involved in places over oil . \nthe message has not been communicated well to the American people . \nWe may not have lost any men in assisting with this ` No Fly Zone , ' but as a country that is running low on money it is important to remember that tomahawk missiles , fuel for naval vessels , and aircraft sorties are expensive . \nLibya had better have been worth it . \nMy understanding is that the Libya offensive is a joint operation approved by the Arab League and the UN with the purpose of keeping Moammar Gadhafi 's forces from massacring those citizens who had opposed his long totalitarian rule . \nGadhafi 's troops were marching across the country , and he had decreed that he would search out and kill all his opponents . \nPresident Obama has made it clear that the U.S. 's role is to be limited and that France and England have taken the lead in fulfilling the mission . \nThe verbal attacks on President Obama for either being too slow to support the opposition or too fast to do so without complete consultation demonstrate how difficult it is in the current poisoned political atmosphere to map out a middle way . \nWhatever decision the President makes now is roundly criticized by partisans all around . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:15 pm | Jack -- It is pretty straightforward . \nThe Europeans wanted the US to lead as usual so that they could go in as the peacemakers and enjoy the spoils of war . . \nThe Arab League wanted the US to go in so that they could have their bogeyman for the hungry masses . . \nThe Russians and Chinese obviously also wanted the US to go in so that they could extend their hands of friendship to these regimes . \nPresident Obama played it perfectly and forced everyone to show their hand . \nNow the Europeans are having to put their money where their mouth is , the Russians and Chinese had to vote for the UN resolution or face the backlash from the Arab streets . \nAll Obama has agreed to do is help the allies by using the unique military capabilities of the US . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:16 pm | My take is we have the critical equipment to do the initial phase and then turn it over to NATO or whoever and be in a supporting role , as Bob Gates has said . \nAs for the republicans in Congress , they need to just sit down and shut up like they did when `` W '' was starting wars we did n't need . \nWhat does Monica Lewinsky have to do with Libya ? \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:16 pm | Well , Mark , and anyone else for that matter , we do n't need to be involved in any more `` police actions '' . \nI also understand what 's being `` said '' , but there are times you need to step back and analyze the entire situation . \nIt is definitely tragic that a tyrant is killing civilians , but that does n't mean that the U.S. needs to jump in to help out . \nFrance was all gung-ho about getting in there , so let them do it . \nThis is one time that we need to ride the bench . \nThere are plenty of other nations who are more than willing to set up a pupet government in Libya . \nOh and one other thing , since the Arab League was all for enforcing a no fly zone , why are n't Arab League jets doing the attacking ? \nAnd on top of that , we have demonstrations in the U.S. over unions , how long before that turns really ugly ? \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:16 pm | Theres two understandings president Obamas and the United Nations which over rules which will Gadhafi go free because the United Nations says no . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:17 pm | Wait a second !? Were n't the republicans the ones crying for Obama to do something sooner ? \nAnd now their upset !? Typical if you ask me . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:18 pm | This war was never America 's problem . \nIf Arabs want democracy they have to fight for it -- plain and simple . \nWhen America does nothing -- it gets blamed for being evil and helping Israel . \nNow America is helping , spending $ , and I can assure you there will be no benefit in the long run . \nThe fact that the Arab League was reconsidering its position after the bombing began was not a surprise -- and shows why leaving the Arab world to fend for itself is probably better for America . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:18 pm | On Libya ... we need to stop trying to Micro Manage the events in Libya . \nThe President in Libya knew exactly what was going to happen in is country and why . \nHe had all the time to prevent anything that would effect his citizens . \nTheir blood is on his hands , not anyone Else 's . \nIn knowing this , Micro Managing this , is only a Method in which only falsely accuses others for the blame of blood being spilled , & done to others . \nIt was n't the cause of others who caused the actions . \nIt was n't them who insisted or caused it . \nSo , let 's put the blame where it is deserved , not on others ! \nThey were given their choice ! \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:18 pm | I understand and approve of the No-fly zone . \nWe cant sit back and let a mad man kill his own people because they want human rights . \nObama did a great job of waiting for and securing a coalition of many nations . \nI only wonder why he did n't have to ask congress for authorization like Bush did before Iraq . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:19 pm | The same as it is in every other conflict to act as the international communities dog and meet their needs and go home . \nWhen we want to cut funding for housing for the disabled but we have money to spend on this nonsense well we have our priorities wrong . \nIf France and England want to enforce a no fly zone that is fine but let them spend the money on it . \nThe U.S. should do NOTHING besides put our stamp of approval on it we need to take care of America first ! \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:19 pm | i ca n't figure out what our role is in the world period . . \nif we are so supportive of the downtrodden and oppressed , why are n't we launching ait strikes on the Ivory Coast ? \noh wait , no oil . . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:19 pm | I believe most of the firepower , the ships are American . \nWe are told the Brits have one ship there . \nThere appears to be a pretense that America is n't leading it , perhaps to protect this President from responsibility . \nHe seems very interested in distancing himself . \nAmericans are not happy about that ! \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:19 pm | I am not concerned about a so called well defined mission in Libya . \nI am glad that we are finally taking action to stop this madman . \nI just hope it is not too late . \nAs far as I am concerned the first missile strike should have targeted Gadhafi . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:19 pm | Jim Campbell , St. Paul , MN The military action is designed to stop aggression against innocent civilians . \nAfter that , it will be up to the people of Libya to decide its leadership . \nThe many sanctions imposed already should speed that process . \nMore sanctions will likely be forthcoming . \nI just do n't understand the fuss -LRB- snit -RRB- that some express over this action . \nIf we had to wait for Congress to act , we 'd likely go through months of hearings and a filibuster . \nIn this instance , the Commander in Chief had to act quickly . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:19 pm | 1 . \nWhat 's the strategic objective ? \nWho 's our ally in Libya ? \nDo we KNOW who the rebels are ? \nWhy was Congress not consulted ? \nWhat was the direct threat to the U.S. ? \nNot a single answer from the vacationing 0bama . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:19 pm | When George W invaded Iraq liberals called it an oil war . \nI wonder if calling Libya an `` oil war '' is going to depend on who you voted for . \nThe president 's use of military force in Libya is wise and just . \nHundreds of armed , bad men burned to death today while en route to Benghazi with the intent of killing innocent women , children and men . \nThe president is right to experiment with tectonic military and diplomatic forces to mitigate civilian losses in war zones around the world . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | It was my understanding that our current mission in Libya was to stop Gaddafi from killing his own people . \nI heard that this would be accomplished with C-130s dropping ponies , unicorns , rainbows and all manner of things nice upon the good Colonel 's forces as well as those of the Opposition ; sure that would stop all of the fighting . \nAs to why we are seemingly leading NATO and Arab states in dropping bombs and firing missiles , I do n't know . \nI do hope the President will clarify that for us . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | Our role in this conflict is the acting force of the United Nations . \nThe United Nations does not have a formal military , so countries with ably militaries have to support their decisions for the good of the world . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | We accomplished another no fly zone mission very well and will pass command to the coalition . \nYou should know this fact jack so lets stick with the facts on this mission to stop another dictator slaughtering his people . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | Its amazing , first Obama 's critics claim he is not doing enough in Libya and that he is making America seem weak . \nNow that the United States is part of this coalition and is actively making strikes in Libya people still are not happy . \nObama can never win with some people . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | As I see it , our mission is to level the playing field in terms of attacks by aircraft and\\/or helicopters against the anti-Gaddafi forces . \nMy understanding is we 're over there taking the power away from one of the worst guys in the world . \nUnlike most of our loser politicians , the current President understands we need to keep a low profile . \nOtherwise we wo n't be able to get on an airplane without some character lighting his underpants on fire or stuffing bombs in his shoes . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | On Libya ... we need to stop trying to Micro Manage the events in Libya . \nThe President in Libya knew exactly what was going to happen in his country and why . \nHe had all the time to prevent anything that would effect his citizens . \nTheir blood is on his hands , not anyone Else 's . \nIn knowing this , Micro Managing this , is only a Method in which only falsely accuses others for the blame of blood being spilled , & done to others . \nIt was n't the cause of others who caused the actions . \nIt was n't them who insisted or caused it . \nSo , let 's put the blame where it is deserved , not on others ! \nThey were given their choice ! \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | Tomahawk cruise missile is likely to prove a key weapon in the allied assault on Libyan military targets . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | For many years , the USA has been waiting for this opportunity to finally take Ghadaffi out as they did with Saddam . \nGhadaffi has bullied the USA for a very long time . \nIf you wanna bully America , America will revenge . \nIt 's unfortunate that , we did n't have a Republican president make this happen quicker than it did . \nWhy bother with the likes of Zimbabwe or Ivory Coast ? \nSaddam Hussien never killed an American citizen and we sent several hundred thousand troops , bombed his country into oblivion and set him up to be hung but we are n't going after a man who was behind a plane bombing that killed Americans . \nWe do n't have money for a WIC program to feed underpriviledged children but we have billions for a ` no fly zone '' . \nAnd you want people to understand what is happening . \nHow is that possible . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | Woody from Lake Havasu , AZ Jack , Lybia 's so-called leader was killing his own people . \nThe U.N. made their decision for a no fly zone . \nIt was the right thing to do . \nThey could not do it without the aid of the U.S. . \nAs far as Congress , they can not even come up with a budget . \nWho cares what Congress thinks . \nAt least I do n't . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | All I know is that at $ 1.4 M per cruise missile we just blew up a lot cash we can ill afford to spend . \nConsidering that Italy imports 60 % of their oil from Libya , and is just across the Mediterranean from them , why did n't THEY lead the offensive ? \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | Our job ? \nDrop a few bombs , hopefully take out a crazed weasel of a dictator and then come home . \nLet the rest of the countries do the heavy lifting for a change . \nBut we went in there to prevent a slaughter . \nGood job for Pres Obama . \nGood Job for Our Military Heroes . \nGood on ya to the Libyan people . \nWe 've cleared the way , now go kick Gadhafi 's ass . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | I believe that their isnt much of a choice when it comes to something decided by the UN we are apart of the United Nations and need to stand by them should we not and begin to loose their support in the aprarently troubled times to come . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | Jack : I think it 's clear the goal in Libya is to protect civilians . \nIf the president had gone to the U.S. Congress before military involvement , more civilians would have been killed . \nIt took the international community way to long to step in . \nI applaud the president for not delaying assistance any longer . \nHe is not required to consult the Congress ahead of time , he has 60 days to seek Congressional approval under the War Powers Act of 1973 . \nCongress needs to get over it and I 'm sure the president will make his case to them when he returns from an important international trip . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | Jack , we all know why we are in Libya . \nTo get rid of a brutal dictator . \nFew weeks ago the same people were calling the President weak and hesitating to give a presidential directive , now ... they do n't know why we are in Libya . \nCoalition not just the US is involed , even the French started air strike before we did . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:21 pm | Jack , it means this maniac in charge of Libya has already shot down a plane with Americans on it ... he wiggled his way back into our good graces , and now he 's on the loose again ... I 'm with Obama ... Gadhafi 's gotta go ... I see the United States in his cross hairs . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:21 pm | Why is it that we always seem to find the billions to fight wars and enforce no fly zones in far off places but can not come up with $ 600M to build the fence on our southern border which is a bigger threat than Libya . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:21 pm | Put simply US participation in Libya is just an extension of our goal of world dominance . \nBy now we all should know that it is really not about the people that get shot at , just that the people doing the shooting think like we think . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:21 pm | Its for the Oil , just like Bush , invasion of Iraq . \nWe don ; t care about civilian dead , and never had or the stuff like Weapons of Mass Destruction , Same stuff here , just trying to help the civilians . \nWhere are my Leftist , my Gobbels , my Goring and the rest of their crowd going wild about the Oil ... Because the are all lying idiots dragging this nation down . \nHey Jack , where is you whine about the oil ???? March 21 , 2011 at 5:21 pm | My understanding is that we are there to protect civilians . \nBut how does it play out ? \nStep one : Paralyze Gadhafi 's forces to the greatest extent possible . \nStep two : Secure the safety of civilians by patroling areas that are vulnerable to attacks by Gadhafi 's forces so that forces loyal to his regime are unable to strike at will or without significant resistance by equally or better armed forces . \nStep three : It is n't really a step at all . \nIt 's an outcome . \nThe chaos of battle spawns unintended consequences and we become more entrenched in the situation than we earlier envisioned in steps one and two . \nStep four : Now the nasty stuff kicks in as profiteers lobby for a continuos monitoring and `` always on '' presence in the country . \nUS role in Libiya ? \nFar from home , a carbon copy of Iraq and Afghanistan , increase of Anti-American sentiments , a futile effort to control the world . \nActs like this will win no respect or allies . \nLifesaver is a cheap candy that rots your teeth . \nIt has nothing to do with protection of innocent civilians armed to the teeth , called rebels . \nIn addition , indiscriminate use of missiles and other military capabilities can be percived as a peace-saving acts only by hopeless imbeciles with disarmed analytical capacities of their brains . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:21 pm | The role is a humanitarian action . \nThe Gaddafi regime has violated several international laws that protect civilians . \nThey still continue to do so . \nThere was urgency for action or there would have been a genocide . \nIf there was no action than what is the purpose of the UN . \nI thought one of the roles is to protect the civilians of the world . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:22 pm | The President has shown at every turn of the Egypt and now Libya crises that his supposedly superlative understanding of foreign relations was feined ; that he can not provide the leadership that Hillary does and that the world would perhaps -LRB- unbelievably -RRB- even prefer the straightforward and predictable approach of Bush to this rambling detached approach . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:22 pm | It was time to lead and Obama lead . \nYou do n't stand by silently and do nothing while a people is killed off by their so called `` leader '' . \nWhat is the old saying , `` people get the government they deserve -LRB- earn -RRB- '' . \nSeems to me the Liberians are trying to earn the government they deserve . \nJust need a helping hand . \nWe got it from the French during the revolutionary war . \nTime to give back . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:22 pm | It 's pretty simple , Jack . \nRead the UN Resolution . \nWe are part of a coalition of NATO and Arab Nations to protect the Libyan people who are protesting against the dictator , Gaddafi . \nAdditionally , on its own merit , the Obama Administration has decided that Gaddafi must go . \nWhat 's so hard to understand ? \nIt 's not a war , it is a humanitarian effort in protecting innocent people who asked for our help . \nWe are currently leading the effort because 2 -RRB- NATO asked us to and b -RRB- we were in the region and have the means . \nOthers needed time to step up and step in . \nI 'd like to ask the confused congressional members how they feel this effort differs from Bosnia or Grenada . \nI find their ` confusion ' to be political and offensive . \nObama is after all our Commander in Chief . \nMakes me wonder if they 'd be this confused if Bush had calls these shots . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:22 pm | Firstly , I 'm a Canadian relying on CNN to get the latest on Lybia . \nIf that should mean anything , the world is relying on the US to get the news on foreign issues . \nI think the republicans need to get their heads out of their rears and start realizing the impact the US is having in the world . \nPeople are singing praise in Lybia and around the world . \nMilitary action is a method of reaction . \nIf you see innocent deaths likely to happen , you react . \nObama has been nothing but transparent on the topic . \nHe has been vocal on his hesitance and his eagerness to pull out A.S.A.P. . \nYou do n't ask NATO to step in to run to the grocery store . \nIf anything , Obama needs praise for his ability to put aside his own wishes for the better of the world , not threatened to be impeached and removed from office . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:22 pm | I think it was very clear from the press conference earlier that the objective is to protect Libyan civilians from random killing and senseless massacre , not to help the opposition . \nHowever , the question is ... if the opposition continues to press forward will we then attack them ? \nI do n't like being the world 's police force , but I like being the people who stand on the sideline and watch the bullies beat up the weak even more . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:22 pm | I understand and approve of the No-fly zone and missile strikes on military targets . \nWe cant sit back and let a mad man kill his own people because they want human rights . \nObama did a great job of waiting for and securing a coalition of many nations . \nI only wonder why he did n't have to ask congress for authorization like Bush did before Iraq . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:22 pm | The message is clear ... As part of UN declaration 1973 and at the request of the Arab League , this is a humanitarian mission to overthrow a regime that is killing its own people . \nThe world watching another Rwanda or Bosnia is not an option . \nIt is easy to be a Monday morning quarterback and the Arab League 's distancing themselves afterwards should not be a surprise . \nTo politicize this is wrong -LRB- but also expected -RRB- . \nIt is the right move and I trust will come to a swift ending . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:22 pm | President Obama appears to be scripted from the same cloth as former President Bush . \nUnder the auspices of `` human rights '' or `` humanitarian '' intervention the US and and its allies are enforcing a UN no-fly zone . \nI ca n't help but see the shadow of Big Oil companies peeking out from behind the curtain , and the manipulating the puppet strings . \nIf you can believe it , this military intervention in Libya was sold even less to the American people than the Iraq War in 2003 . \nThe 2012 elections ca n't come soon enough . \nI think that the whole idea of us being involved is crazy , the Arabs are using us and then will turn on us as they always have . \nWe have more than enough problems here and can not even control the 2 wars we 're already committed to . \nIf our country goes bankrupt who will bail us out . \nStay out of foreign affairs and re-build our country . \nMy understanding of the Libya No Fly Zone Offensive is very clear to me as President Obama publicly made the case for the institution of this operation -- the purpose for the No Fly Zone is to save the lives of Libyian civilians and to prevent genocide , the destablization of neighboring countries in the North African and Southern European region where a humanitarian crisis could ensue . \nI do not understand the hysteria on the part of members of Congress about not being consulted . \nThe President has the legal authority to initiate military action without consulting Congress . \nHowever , the President did consult with some Congressional members of both political parties prior to initating any military action . \nI applaud President Obama for being cautious , prudent and willing to consult with members of Congress , his cabinet prior to taking any action . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:23 pm | I can understand the role just fine . \nI wish it went a few steps farther and actually allowed us to go in there and throw Gaddhafi out rather than try to evict him from afar . \nWe need to march on Tripoli now so we do n't need to do it again later . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:23 pm | I thought it was a `` No fly Zone '' operation , now I am hearing that we are attacking ground forces ... . \nand his palace , guess he has AA guns in the front yard . \nAn now the Arab Nations are not supporting combat operation ? \nWhy dont they just call it for what it is ... WAR . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:23 pm | I ca n't tell what the administration has decided . \nThey 're being too evasive . \nIf they want to hold their cards `` close to the chest '' to keep Gadhafi guessing , then that 's OK as long as they at least tell Congress -LRB- in secret , if necessary -RRB- what they 're thinking . \nBut it does n't appear that they 've done that . \nWe hear the results from Boehner and others . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:23 pm | When did we become the policing force of the world ? \nAnd how is the situation in Libya so desperate that it requires such drastic action ? \nIs it any more dire than the situation in Japan , where we could be spending our funding toward positive humanitarian action ? \nI think the point is , the American public DOES N'T understand our offensive in Libya . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:23 pm | I would just like to remind Congress that if the French had not assisted us with a 1700 's version of a `` no fly zone '' , with a shipping blockade against the British , there would ` nt be an America . \nIt is profoundly hypocritical for our congress to be against the actions of peoples who are striving for ideals that we have lauded for two centuries . \nThis goes for both sides of the house . \nI am deeply ashamed of those who reap the benefits of our freedom then condemn the very methods that made it possible . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:23 pm | Our part is to use some of our unique capabilities -LRB- bombers , missiles , satellites , etc -RRB- to stop and destroy the Libyan capability to harm civilians . \nBeyond that Obama has said Gadaffi must step down . \nI guess by magic ? \nI think we are just stopping a blood bath like he says and giving the rebels a fighting chance . \nIf we do n't do it we look a lot worse than if we do do it . \nSome just want to slam the president over anything and care more about that than the country . \nWe need to get rid of Quadafi , but ca n't come right out and say that . \nIf we leave him there he will just cause terrorist attacks and with us recruiting , training , and funding so many terrorists right here at home we do n't need to be also worrying about him . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:23 pm | The political rhetoric in the US and Europe sounds an awful lot like the Arab League : yes , we want intervention , then NO , we do n't , once the intervention starts . \nYet another Rwanda or does the US -LRB- there is nobody else -RRB- actually do something about it ? \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:23 pm | I have been listening for the last 3 weeks the people of Libya asking for help did we do anything no. . \nNow that United Security Counsel made a decision I am glad that we are helping them . \nIf anyone listens to what is being said you see people in Libya happy that the world is helping . \nNo one should have to be scared to go outside and have the same rights we do . \nWhat is the Senates problem I understand what is going on . \nDid they want to wait until he killed everyone there first and then say oh we should have done something . \nIf the politions ca n't even agree over things that need to be done here what makes them think that they could have said anyhting that would have changer the outcome . \nI AM VERY PROUD OF PRESIDENT OBAMA FOR STANDING UP TO A COUNTRY THAT IS DOING GENICIDE TO HIS OWN PEOPLE . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:24 pm | I 'll tell you what our involvement is in Lybia is Jack . \nFind a new place to drop our bombs . \nAfter all we make them , we must use them . \nWe need to keep our weapon factories rolling and save jobs . \nWe can no longer drop them in Iraq and we are droping less and less in Afghanistan . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:24 pm | When did we become the policing force of the world ? \nAnd how is the situation in Libya so desperate that it requires such drastic action ? \nIs it any more dire than the situation in Japan , where we could be spending our funding toward positive humanitarian action ? \nI think the point is , the American public DOES N'T understand our offensive in Libya . \nAmerica must understand that those who will not hear the messengers of peace will be made to hear the messengers of war . \nAs followers of the Gospel of Peace that was preached by the MAN OF PEACE , Jesus , the Christ , let us strive to be the instruments of peace instead of the apparatus of destruction . \n-- Preacher March 21 , 2011 at 5:24 pm | The missile attacks on Lybia were : 1 . \nIniated and agreed upon by the United Nations Security Council ; 2 . \nThe United States a 2 . \nThe air strikes were aimed at military weapon 's sites in Lybia - not on Kadafi or innocent civilians ; I do believe we should not AND DID NOT ACT March 21 , 2011 at 5:24 pm | I totally support President Obama . \nWhere were these republicans when President Bush went to war without Congress 's permission ? \nSilent !! At least Obama had the UN behind him and the support of the Arab League ! \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:24 pm | I was against any intervention , BUT now the attacks against Gadhaffi have been somewhat partial . \nI 'm wondering why Obama went to Brazil and then ordered the attacks ? \nIs it that there is a way to try to appease the American public since that France and Britain are involved ? \nOr is it a ruse to gain trust from the American people in lieu of the problems here in the US ? \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:24 pm | My understanding of the US role is one of participation only . \nThe Congress is as usual way off target . \nThey were informed , just a might forgetful as usual . \nTell Congress to read UN mandate 1973 , it spells it all out and only idiots could not understand it . \nThey have to live under a rock not to know the US position . \nThey are like a bunch of bratty kids , always complaining about something . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:24 pm | It 's time you ppl started listening to your President and stop trying to go against him . \nHe was very clear from the beginning . \nHe said you will not be on the ground unlike what Bush did . \nBush took it upon himself . \nMaybe ppl should read 1973 . \nWhen it is a U.N involvement of all countries , the United States is always there . \nPresident Obama is very clear if you only listen and further more the U.N does not have to answer to the American congress , this in not just a U.S. war like the one the republications created . \nI understand the Presidents comments to mean that in a few days\\/weeks the US will withdraw military involvement in Libya and leave it to it 's allies . \nIf so then the US have started the war and then backing out and leaving it to European countries to possibily get their military killed a kind of '' we 've started now you finish '' . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:24 pm | The whole objective in Libya is a gamble that the ` rebels ' will replace Gaddafi with a pro-western government that will be less of a threat to USA interests . \nThis help preserve the oil we get from that region and is further protection for Israel . \nHumanatarian needs etc is just an excuse to protect or oil\\/Israel interest . \nEverything else is just to try and keep the media from attacking us as they did Bush for Iraq . \nVince in Atlanta March 21 , 2011 at 5:24 pm | The U.S. role in Libya is to take out the Libyan air defenses and prevent Libyan military aircraft and tanks from massacring civilians . \nAnyone who actually wants a madman to kill civilians with smiling mercenaries equiped with military hardware is entitled to their opinion but is not someone I care to debate . \nI generally avoid talking to heartless idiots and cowards . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:24 pm | President Obama has ABSOLUTELY no choice but to participate in the Libyan Offensive , not to mention a UN resolution . \nThe genocide of oppressed civilians who are fighting for freedom , as far as I 'm concerned , is the most significant and justifiable reason for a US offensive I 've ever seen . \nWe advocate the spread of democracy in the middle east , how could we not be involved !? March 21 , 2011 at 5:24 pm | Prevention of genocide is the reason we are involved in this action . \nIt is a just action . \nThink about what could have been prevented in Rwanda or go all the back to 1939 and think about the millions of lives that , perhaps , could have been saved . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:24 pm | America 's role in Libya is what America 's role has always been in recent years . \nIt is to be the whipping boy for all the countries in the United Nations Assembly when only the United States will take a stand , wrong or right , against the outrageous actions of states against fellow human beings . \nIt 's present and future roles are to be cencured by the Arab League for doing what is necessary against the thugs that the league can not admit they need the US to do for their good . \nIt will also be Obama 's role , in Libya , to take the hit from the hypocrites of both parties , in Washington , wherein Obama can be blamed for every action they wo n't take . \nAgain it will be shown : No Good Deed Goes Unpunished ! \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:24 pm | My understanding is that 1 -RRB- people who demonstrated peacefully for regime change were attacked by their fearless leader 2 -RRB- these demonstators began to fight in defense 3 -RRB- a coaliton of nations moved -LRB- perhaps too slowly -RRB- to provide a no fly zone 4 -RRB- the US was one of those nations 5 -RRB- at this point , the battle is once again a fair one , and the Libyan people hope to remove Moamar G from power , but it 's up to them 6 -RRB- as usual , our wonderful representatives are reacting in every nuclear way possible , grandstanding among those reactions . \nWhere 's the wisdom ? \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:24 pm | America 's role is to protect oil ... as usual . \nAnyone who ca n't see through this farce of `` protecting civilians '' and `` spreading democracy '' must be stupid enough to believe that we found WMDs in Iraq . \nCa n't wait to see which new tyrant will replace Ghadafi ... of course , this new tyrant will be NATO-approved !!! Great job , America ! \nThanks for once again meddling in the affairs of a sovereign nation . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:25 pm | I 'm confused about the cease fire . \nSeems it only goes one way . \nSeems the Rebels can attack and kill , but they are not being bombed ? \n` Humanitarian bombing ' ? \nKind of ironic , huh ? \nWe should NOT be involved in their civil war . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:25 pm | My understanding is that the US is providing a very vital role in warfare that most countries in the UN are unable to provide , and that is command and control of the skies . \nThey are doing this while allowing other nations to provide ground support when the time is right . \nIt is as it should be , this strategy makes sense , because of our economic position does not allow us to fight another full scale war . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:25 pm | EDIT : I think it was very clear from the press conference earlier that the objective is to protect Libyan civilians from random killing and senseless massacre , not to help the opposition . \nHowever , the question is ... if the opposition continues to press forward will we then attack them ? \nI do n't like being the world 's police force , but I like being the people who stand on the sideline and watch the bullies beat up the weak even less . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:25 pm | Jack , US foreign policy is getting hilarious . \nWe certainly ca n't blame Obama for his floundering . \nIt was all started by his predecessor of showing America 's muscle everywhere . \nWhile bar fights are ok when needed , you ca n't simply go join a bar-fight because some drunks are having a go at each other . \nThis is what it looks like . \nAmerica wants to throw the bar bully Gaddafi out dead or alive . \nBut listen to the silly stories they are making to mask the objective . \nForget Bush , call a spade a spade ! \nOur role is to support the UN Resolution for a `` NO Flight Zone '' over Libya , in order to stop Ghadafi 's forces from killing other Libyans . \nIt 's interesting ... the president was at first criticized for not acting quickly enough , and now he 's being criticized for acting too quickly . . \nPoor man , he 's damned if he does , and damned it he does n't . \n!! March 21 , 2011 at 5:25 pm | my understanding is that our role in this is to simply to prevent a madman from killing his own civilians . \ni wonder if the people criticizing the president would sing the same tune if their families were in the areas in danger of being slaughtered . \nwe are in a time of war , we are acting under authorization of the u.n. and have support from many nations on a mission that saves countless lives . \ncongress needs to suck it up and get over the feeling of being left out . \nthis is the time to support our armed forces and our president , not to bicker amongst ouselves . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:25 pm | Jack , I believe that the U.S. role in the Libya offensive is exactly as President Obama describe and as laid out in U.N Resolution 1973 . \nI wish you folks at CNN will make up your minds -- you ca n't have it both way . \nLast week , it was said that President Obama was slow getting involved , slow taking action , he needed to move , now that he has , there is more rubbish . \nWhere were you when Bush took us to war ? \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:25 pm | He 's dirthering AND rushing to judgement . \nHe 's ignoring Congress AND not being a bold , Executive Branch leader . \nHe 's launching a Christian Crusade AND protecting his cherished Arab\\/Islamic brothers . \nHe 's fighting Israel 's war AND opening the door for an Jew-hating , Islamic Republic . \nObama-Haters , did I miss anything ? \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:25 pm | I think the President was clear that the US military action is strictly to support the UN Resolution , which is narrower than what Obama 's says his desire is with respect to Qaddafi 's tenure - i.e. , that it ends now . \nThat there is bipartisan questioning of the Administration 's position on Libya speaks more to the desire of Congress to carry out US military and diplomatic policy from Capitol Hill , than concern over what we 're doing there . \nPersonally , I like the separation of powers concept ... March 21 , 2011 at 5:25 pm | Well Jack , it 's very difficult to understand what is going on . \nHow you can bomb a country without going to war ? \nHow the leader of that country needs to step down but we are not going to harm him ? \nWho makes these rules when the UN and the USA are NOT even thinking the same on what is going on . \nEndgame unclear frazzles my mind as there certainly should be an endgame policy . \nRules being made up as you go along , looks like American citizens are paying for more military ventures . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:26 pm | Barbara Teixeira - Las Vegas , NV My understanding is that we were going to be in a support role . \nNow we are bombing sites ? \nThen the President says we will step back from a leading role in a matter of days ? \nI have heard so may conflicting stories , I am thoroughly confused . \nWhat I am not confused about though , is that our President got us into this without consulting Congress . \nI find that very upsetting . \nWhile I believe that we should join forces with other nations to assist the Libyan people , I do not think the President should have made that decision on his own and dragged us into a leading role . \nHe is the President , not an dictator . \nIf he can do this without consulting Congress , what will he decide to do in the future without consulting them . \nI find that very frightening . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:26 pm | I do n't understand our role in Libya . \nWe should n't be there at all . \nThe people in that region say we are Infidels . \nWhy are there no Arabic people who want to protect innocent people from mass murder ? \nI am all for helping people in danger , but their people should want to help themselves with us . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:26 pm | For once -LRB- probably for the best -RRB- we are in a support role , rather than bearing the brunt . \nIn this position , we can offer the coalition our military expertise which surpasses the rest of the coalition put together . \nAs far as Obama is concerned , there will be the group of people who will criticize him , no matter what he does . \nThe impromptu targets taken will result in a an Accidental Regime Change . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:26 pm | 1 . \nUS will pay with resources & people . \nEurpoeans may stand in the sidelines . \nLiberals will cry foul -LRB- it is a war about Oil -RRB- . \nUS hater 's cry will be heard loud and clear . \nRepublicans may call it Obama 's war . \nAl Queida may muster , more support in Libya . \nFew , may understand that there is country name Libya . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:26 pm | Anyone who claims they do n't know what our mission is , probably is n't listening , I think the President has made it perfectly clear and made sure it was not a unilateral effort . \nAs for all the cry babies who claim they do n't know what 's going on , that 's just politics as usual it always coming from the same people . \nI do not understand America 's role in the Libya 's offensive . \nHowever , when the Sri Lankan government massacred more 40,000 innocent civilians , America did not step in at all . \nThe events occurring in Libya are a result in the want for oil , not as an action to better the people . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:26 pm | These are the same members of congress that were complaing that the president was too slow in reacting to the Libyan problem ? \nThe same mebers of congress who are not in DC at this time ? \nAnother vacation for our -LRB- respected ? -RRB- \nAs has been stated before , our role as well as our allies is to protect the Libyan peoples from Ghadafi 's genocide of his own peoples . \nHe is a despot who has shown his disregard for his own people by even using them as a shield against the bombing of his assets . \nThe U.N. was correct in its wording of resolution 1973 . \nAs for congress , stay at home . \nThe american people are fed up with their antics in the name of politics . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:26 pm | My understanding of the Libya No Fly Zone Offensive is very clear to me as President Obama publicly made the case for the institution of this operation the purpose for the No Fly Zone is to save the lives of Libyian civilians and to prevent genocide , the destablization of neighboring countries in the North African and Southern European region where a humanitarian crisis could ensue . \nThis would be a limited operation that the U.S play a nonleading roll . \nNo U.S. ground forces would be deployed . \ndo not understand the hysteria on the part of members of Congress about not being consulted . \nThe President has the legal authority to initiate military action without consulting Congress . \nHowever , the President did consult with some Congressional members of both political parties prior to initating any military action . \nI applaud President Obama for being cautious , prudent and willing to consult with members of Congress , his cabinet prior to taking any action . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:26 pm | My understanding of the US role is as follows : In support of the U.N. Resolution 1973 , the United States is offering its military services temporarily to the ` coalition ' in order to protect Libyan citizens from government abuses at the hands of Gaddafi as stated in the resolution . \nThe Libyan people should have the ability to make the choice on whether or not they want a Gaddafi government . \nGaddafi 's military has prevented them from having this option . \nThat is the purpose of the mission , to allow citizens to exercise their human rights to decide their government . \nThe U.S. policy , however , is in regard to the dictator itself because simply you can not call a mission a success without solving the problem . \nGaddafi is the problem . \nPlanes and guns did not fire themselves upon the Libyan people , Gaddafi did . \nIn order to make sure that such a crisis does not happen again , Gaddafi will have to be removed from power . \nThis can be done by allowing the Libyan people to hunt him down and decide his fate -LRB- believe me , they deserve at least this much -RRB- . \nThis can also be done by economic sanctions , international arrest warrants , account freezes , etc. and does not require military intervention . \nThis is n't the U.S. vs. Gaddafi , it is the world saying we have had enough and together we are enacting Resolution 1973 . \nAmerica is just a team player , not a leader . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:27 pm | Carol from South Plainfield , NJ I would like to tell those Congressmen to get over themselves . \nThe United States is assisting in the preservation of life for those countless Libyans that Ghadhafi has no compunction about annihilating . \nWe are assisting others from the UN in creating a no-fly zone and stopping the Libyan military and mercenaries from destroying innocent lives . \nI do n't believe we will put a single American military foot on the ground , I think we are doing the right thing with the no-fly . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:27 pm | The initial reason for the no fly zone is to stop any Libyan offensive against their citizens . \nNow we hear that we may want `` regime change '' and the complete ouster of Gadhafi . \nRight now , we do need more clarification ... yesterday Obama said `` No ground troops '' but if we really want regime change , can we avoid it ? \nWhy is it in our best interest to go into ANOTHER war while we have two others currently ongoing ? \nThe biggest problem Obama faces now , is the same one that Bush faced in Iraq ... what does `` winning '' look like ? \nAn address to the American people is needed , clarify to the citizens and to congress what we are doing . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:27 pm | I blieve our role in libya is soften up the Gaddafi military machine enough so that the rebel forces are able to take over the government . \nGaddafi will likely be executed in the process , Whether that happens as a casualty of the US assault , or those of our allies , or capture by the Libyan people and subsequent trial is largely irrelevant . \nFreedom for Libya is the bbjective and Gadaffi the person has no price on his head for America any more . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:27 pm | My understanding of America 's role in Libya is what I believe the President wants it to be : subject to his personal interpretation of the UN resolution . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:27 pm | John Boehner and I 'm sure others in congress are butthurt because they were left in the dark . \nI commend Obama in his decision to disable Muammar Gaddafi . \nThis also shows the rest of the world such as Iran and North Korea what could happen if they do n't keep in line . \nIt 's about time we fought a war using our high tech capabilities . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:27 pm | My understanding of our involvement in Libya is to be part of an international gang trying to hijack Mr. Kadaffy and get him out of power under the guise of `` helping the people '' . \nTo be sure , this is an oversimplification and may be offensive to some , but is n't that what we are really doing ? \nThe biggest trouble I see at that -LRB- 1 -RRB- Obama is hijacking the Constitutional provisions of our government by going over Congress ' heads and unilaterally making his own decision to enter this war -- and it IS a war . \nWhen you bomb a foreign territory , it is WAR ! \nHis lack of knowledge of how the real world work and his inexperience in governing is coming home to roost on those who thought that hope-y , change-y thing was going to happen under his leadership . \nI am with those who would impeach this man for sprouting into a dictator himself . \nI am a WWII daughter of 73 y\\/o so have been around the political block a few times . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:27 pm | Gadhafi vowed to eradicate all men , women and children not loyal to him . \nThe only way to protect the Libyan people is to eradicate Gadhafi . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:27 pm | Humanitarian , I pray . \nHowever , that is probably wishful thinking . \nEither way , it is not going to achieve anything for its people or the U.S. if we and the supportive allies play more politics the likes of Iraq and Afghanistan . \nGadhafi is the problem of Libya . \nHe must be ousted or killed before escalation occurs . \nWe can not proceed halfheartedly or without the open resolve of ridding the world of Gadhafi ... and son . \nHe is a narcissistic sociopath that can neither be tolerated or trusted . \nTo not make him a target is to betray any valid purpose or intent to justify our being there . \nOur presence , along with others , in Libya , must be first and foremost to rid its people of Gadhafi . \nObama and the Congress must tell the world this and do it swiftly and precisely . \nWhere have the republicans been hiding Jack ? \nI 'm certain that they all know that the US 's role and stratagy in Libya is precicely the same as it is in Iraq and Afghanistan . \nMaybe someday they will tell the American people what that is . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:28 pm | It 's pretty clear to me that the US & Canada have joined other nations who agreed to enforce the security council ruling . \nThe difference is that your not really attacking another country , you 're wearing your world police hat . \nWe did n't get much consultation here in Canada either . \nAnd these enforcements can go on for years . \nOften with the US footing a bulk of the bill . \nIt is dis-ingeniousness for Republicans to criticize the US involvement in Libya when they rushed us off to war in Iraq with no road-map of what we were doing there or how to get out . \nThat was a systematic takeover of the country . \nIn addition , this is not Iraqi deja vu either . \nThis action is more akin to NATO 's past involvement in Serbia 's repression and genocide of its own citizens . \nWe should have let it play out with no US intervention . \nWe need to demonstrate that important world problems can be solved without us in a leadership role . \nThe Arab states should be able to handle it , and if not alone then with European help . \nWe are overextended as it is . \nNo one believes the limp explanation re human rights . \nSince when have we been concerned with human rights ? \nNot in Dafur , not the Congo , not the Ivory Coast , not Syria , and certaionly not Zimbabwe , where people were better off when it was Rhodesia . \nNo we should have sat it out . \nNow we must ready ourselves for Libyan terrorist retaliation . \nAsk James Baker , ask Zbig . \nAsk Colin , `` I got us into Iraq because Bush ordered me '' Powell . \nNow that he is independent he can speak his mind . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:28 pm | Jack , I 'm proud of President Obama 's decisiveness . \nHas it been that long ago that we watched while innocent people were being killed for no good reason ? \nWe need to help these people before more blood is shed . \nSeems to me that too many of us are only concerned about ourselves these days . \nThose complaining will never be satisfied so lets do the decent thing . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:28 pm | We created a war of attrition between two groups , we sell arms to both sides , they will kill each other for years , and we make sure neither side wins , we steal their oil . \nWin win situation for the elites . \nA classical scenario , written and orchestrated by CIA March 21 , 2011 at 5:28 pm | Probably the best allegory would be our involvement in the Balkans in the 1990s . \nWe were there to protect a group of people from being attacked and wiped out . \nMost of the action was in the air , with a wide ranging coalition . \nWe lost 1 soldier during that campaign - to an accident . \nThe President says we 'll soon take a back seat . \nDifference between him and the last President is that I believe that 's what will happen . \nNo expectation of `` flowers on the tanks here . '' \nNot like Iraq - where it was a war of opportunity with a coalition consisting of Britain , humanitarian aid from other major countries , and combat troops from every third-world country in eastern Europe . \nWe 've lost thousands of soldiers there . \nRepublicans have demanded action for the last week , and now they 're skirts are all blown up because he did something ? \nSeems like being informed by Congress was no big deal when `` their man '' was in the White House . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:28 pm | Mr Boehner , others need to make up their minds ! \nFirst the President was n't acting quick enough , now he 's doing what he can with minimum involvement and you want to impeach him ? \nHe is not the first president to help out in these situations . \nShould he let all these men , women and kids get slaughtered because you feel the way you do ? \nI hope you do n't ever get in a situation where you need help , of any kind , and nobodys there for you . \nIf you have questions about the Rebels , go to Libya , find out for yourselves if you are really that concerned . \nCongress spoke with the President and knew what he was doing . \nThey 've had a month , heard what was being considered and NOW wants to act concerned that it 's the wrong thing to do !!!! No wonder the government ca n't get anything done . \nThey 're too busy trying to find fault in what someone is doing . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:28 pm | My understanding is that the US is providing a very vital role in warfare that most countries in the UN are unable to provide , and that is command and control of the skies in order to effectively enforce the no fly zone , we are doing what we do best in that respect . \nThey are doing this while allowing other nations to provide ground support when the time is right . \nIt is as it should be , this strategy makes sense , because our economic position does not allow us to fight another full scale war at this time . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:28 pm | Like the other presidents before , he did not learn from their misstakes , yes America likes being bitten by the same dog twice , whatever happened with the old saying `` once bitten twice shy ? '' \nYou are not a fool if you do something foolish , only if the folly of it escapes you . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:28 pm | I do n't see the confusion that you and the Republicans seem to be having with `` understanding '' . \nAfter weeks of UN negotiations and dialog , the mission is nothing more and nothing less than to remove Moammar Gadhafi to prevent continued genocide of civilians . \nAfter 8 years of the Great Decider and falsified documentation of WMD , without a single question from Republicans , it strikes me a ludicrous to even ask the question . \nThis is reasonably straight forward and simple . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:28 pm | I fully understand and approve Pres Obama 's decision . \nAs the Pres mentioned , the only reason they took the lead was because of the technologies the US possess . \nThe INTL community can not just stand by . \nAlso the rebels asked for this as the Arab League . \nOf course the Arab League is in a bit of a twine , because some have problems in their country . \nIf the peoplein Wisconsin went to the streets with guns , tanks and planes what would our government officials do . \nJjust how would we tolerate Libya , France and Great Britian getting involved in our internal affairs . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:29 pm | As far as I 'm concerned , our goals in Libya are about as vague as our goals in Vietnam were . \nWe have been electing these morons for years who will put our troops in harms way without a practical reason . \nWe need to put an end to it now . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:29 pm | Jack , most of us can read and comprehend simple english , but U.N. resolutions are seldom simple . \nTake all necessary action to protect civilian casualties seems a worthless statement when it 's armed civilians that are raising a rebellion . \nIn the end , I ca n't see where the U.S. or the U.N. has the moral or legal authority to determine who should rule in Libya . \nI also fail to see how our bombing air defense sites in Libya meets the U.N. criteria unless Libyan forces are using them to shoot at the protesters . \n-LRB- Which there have no reports of as yet -RRB- . \nThis seems nothing more than a method to replace one leader the U.S. does n't like with someone that may be more pliable to U.S. interests . \n-LRB- i.e. selling us their oil ! -RRB- \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:29 pm | The people of Lybia want the coalitions help in destroying the Charlie Sheen of Lybia . \nGadahfy is insane , out of control and appears to be on drugs himself . \nThe innocent people are being killed and terrorized because they want the freedom that we all want . \nThe freedom to speak and live without the fear of death . \nStay until the job is done . \nDo not get out until !!!!!! March 21 , 2011 at 5:29 pm | From my understanding we are offering Air and Naval support to a group of people that attempted a predominantly peaceful uprising , were met with aggression , and then responded in kind . \nI do n't think we should commit large ground forces , but we do need to demonstrate that if you do not listen to the peaceful protest of your people and you meet them with militant aggression , we will support them and attempt to level the playing field for them . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:29 pm | My understanding of our involvement is to provide a little cover so the Libyan people can form some sort of representative government ... . . \nand get rid of yet another madman who treats his people with utter disdain ... ... I would venture to say that if President Obama was a republican , they would be falling all over themselves , trying to out gush each other on the merits of such action . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:29 pm | US role is to partition Libya . \nOne half will be Gaddafi 's and the other will be the rebels ' who we will have saved , and be in good relations with . \nThe rebel half will control all the oil in Libya , and they will have to pay us back for our help -- in cheap oil -- and buy lots of weapons from us , UK , and France to protect themsleves from the Gaddafi side . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:29 pm | My understanding of our part in the UN 1973 is as follows : # 1 . . \nWe have the necessary missals needed to take out the radar and other items that would cause problems for the pilots and we do not want to share that information with other nations . \nThe President said that we are there doing what we can to help the coalition forces and that within days we will no longer be leading the fight . \nI think the congress , both Dems & Republicans should not be second guessing the President or questioning our roll in the battle to enforce UN 1973 , but rather listen to his Press conferences and let what he says sink in rather than go around trying to make themselves look better . . \nWe know it is an election year , but we only have one President at a time . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:29 pm | President Obama has been very clear to the American people about our role in Libya . \nHe has my trust in our limited participation in protecting the Libyan people . \nThe Republican focus is to lie and criticize everything the current administration does . \nYou have to live under a rock not to have heard President Obama 's explanation of our involvement . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:29 pm | There is no `` Mission '' , we 're just leveling the playing field , at the people of Libya 's request . \nHopefully it does n't turn into a mission ... In this case we 're just the helpful birds in the sky , keeping a watchful eye on our friends of freedom . \nBut be careful , there is unrest in the nest at home ... I think , with the other conflicts in the Middle East and Afghanistan , our forces might be spread too thin . \nHowever , Gadhafi should be dealt with . \nWe may have to take on a more supervisory role in relationship to the forces of all the other countries . \nAt least until our other problems are sorted out . \nOtherwise we may end up unprotected at home . \nI kind of like that we try to resolve conflicts and promote peace but we do have limits . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:30 pm | What is my understanding of America 's role in the Libya offensive ? \nTo get rid of Col. Gonedaffy and his ilk , once and for all . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:30 pm | wow , that was some awful typing by me , but , you get the jist . \nThe left only whines when it is a Republican fighting some injustice . \nWhen it is Obama , why , he is the `` ONE '' and , who can question his moral authority to decide right from wrong . \nWhere is the declaration of war or at least a congressional review ? \nDoes the constitution allow for the use of force without at least an intent of congress ? \nDoes the President have the authority to take orders from the United Nations ? \nDoes he only act on their authority ? \nIf the security council told him to invade Lichenstein , whould be bomb in 24 hours ? \nI guess it was Shrillary whining in his ear that he could no longer take and said , Shrill , go ahead , I ca n't take it , I am out of hee . \nUse the army as you wish . \nThis ai n't no Bosnia , Shrill . \nYou have no end game . \nJust kicked the hornet nest . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:30 pm | My understanding is that we are there to protect the people , not to kill Gaddafi and his sons . \nThis is a civil war and we need to be fair . \nThis is not new to this region of the world . \nWe can not control the world . \nIt is interesting that there is little knowledge about who the opposition is . \nIt appears a good number of Libyans love their leader and are willing to stand up for him . \nI pray that the U.S. will not engage in a war that will cause the deaths of thousands of innocents . \nObama promised to be different . \nHe needs to remember this . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:30 pm | He starts a third war and goes off on vacation . \nHe should be in the war room with the military brass from the Pentagon monitoring this war . \nBut as expected the President is off on vacation like he was when the oil rig blew up in the Gulf . \nI do n't know if it 's bad timing on his part or stupidy . \nI think it 's the latter . \nHere is my question ... We have only four days to be involved in this war , and we are not going to kill Gadhafi even thought he is spewing he will retailiate on anyone involved in this war . \nThen what the heck are we doing there ??????? March 21 , 2011 at 5:30 pm | Yes I totally understand want the mission is . \nThis mission is to protect the the civilians so they can over throw their regime . \nIt is funny how we do n't talk about how good the President is doing in this crisis by not rushing in like Iraq . \nJohn McCain and Joe Lieberman , said he was moving too slow and others are saying he is going to fast , it is a lose lose for the President . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:30 pm | This whole Libya things smacks of colonialism . \nFrance , the United States , and Britian . \nWhere are the Arab states ? \nWhat about Qatar 's four planes ? \nI want one politican to truthfully explain how come not one Arab nation is involved in this affair . \nI am deeply disappointed in President Obama . \nIs he afraid someone will call him chicken ? \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:30 pm | The US Involvement is led by the UN 's Involvement . \nThis simply is protecting the Libyan civilian 's who are being slaughtered by its dictator . \nRemember , the US is acting at the behest of the Arab League , the Libyan Council and the Libyan people . \nThis involvement , thanks to the Obama Administration 's has been focused on a limited involvement resulting by creating a `` no-fly zone '' . \nThe President has been very clear that no US troops will be sent to Libya . \nI do n't understand all of the fuss being generated in Washington . \nWe have heard of the repeated claims that `` this is too little to late '' , and now we are hearing claims that there is no end to our involvement . \nWhy do n't we just give the no fly zone a chance to be completed , rather than constantly being critical . \nGive the President a break ! \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:30 pm | It is very simple , they are part of the UN , the UNs role is to fight for humanitarian causes which Libya obviously has an issue with at the moment . \nA mass genocide has been taking place , and so far people have been doing Squat . \nThis should have been handled a month ago ! \nNow over 12 000 people have allegedly been killed . \nThe real question is , why have we waited for another Hitler to rise to power ? \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:31 pm | We are basically the can opener for the world . \nThis is not our fight but we were dragged into it by our close allies . \nEssentially our role is to evicerate any offensive capabilites the Loyalist have using our multi-billion dollar equipment , then step aside and let our allies take the credit when Kadaffi falls . \nCorrect me if I am wrong but 124 Cruie missles launched the 1st night . \n122 from US assets , 2 from British assets , none from French . \nI do n't know but if you are going to push for war the least you can do is commit more to it . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:31 pm | Pres. Obama knows exactly what he is doing . \nThe U.S. needs to stay out of the mix as much as possible right now when it comes to Libya . \nIf we get too involved with the matters of a revolution of another country we can too easily be blamed for all their problems . \nWe all know Gadhafi is n't mentally stable . \nObama 's actions are going to put him in the position to help the people of Libya claim checkmate on Gadhafi and finally see the freedom every human being deserves . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:31 pm | President Obama is not a kind of president who shout about everything in the open air . \nHe has a better understanding of the world than his fellow congress men and women . \nThese people need to ask Obama how he gets the Arab League support while all Arab countries themselves are in the same kind of trouble . \nBut always what ever the president does , criticism will stay there forever that is the beauty of Washington . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:31 pm | We opened the door to let everyone in so that France and Britain etc. can do the heavy lifting while we do air to air refueling and jamming of Khadafy 's communications etc. . \nWhat would people be saying if , after world wide demand for action , we stood by and watched as Khadafy massacred the opposition ? \nWhat message would that send to the leaders of other Arab countries that are experiencing a revolt ? \nDamned if you do , damned if you do n't , I suppose . \nI 'd rather be on the side that stands up against Khadafy than sits on the side . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:31 pm | I understand that Gadhafi is a genocidal maniac , and America is protecting the Libyan people from genocide . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:31 pm | It is a sad day when the 2 year olds we have in public office would rather see a blood bath in Libya than have their ego 's bruised . \nIn accordance with the UN mandate , we are there to protect the citizens of Libya from a mentally imbalanced leader who would rather see dead citizens rather than anyone who might oppose him . \nIf at the conclusion of the UN mandate , Gadhafi is still the Libyan leader , then the US will take non military actions to try and remove him . \nIf that does not work , I have no doubt Obama will then go to the children in Congress to develop a specifically US response . \nThis is not need right now this minute , we are not at that point yet . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:31 pm | What 's to understand ? \nQaddafi was using heavy artillery to bomb the Libyan equivalent of the Million Man march ! \nIt does n't surprise me that the GOP is crying foul . \nI supported the UNSC resolution long before there was one . \nIf Qaddafi was to remain in power , do n't you think he would return to terrorism and violent political oppression . \nWe need that like a hole in the head . \nThe president has the constitutional authority to do so . \nEveryone of his critics would have done the same thing , and if they did n't , they would n't deserve the job in the first place . \nWhen will people stop the partisanship , and recognize our president as doing , at the very least , a decent job ; I 'd go as far as to say , President Obama is doing a great job ! \nHe does n't deserve the constant animosity he 's receiving from the right , and the ill-conceived , dubious political opposition coming from the left . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:31 pm | Is there nothing the Pres. can say or do that you can understand . \nAfter four days of speeches and press conferences , how is it you still do n't understand nothing . \nYou did not see the people of Lybia protesting after the changes in Egypt . \nIf the Pres. does nothing he should have acted , then when he acted , it was too slow , now that he has acted he should not have acted . \nPeople respect the press because you are supposed to be educated and experienced , but all you do is confuse the ignorant masses . \nWhere were the voices of dissent going into Iraq and Afghanistan . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:31 pm | Generating a sudden demand for Tomahawk missiles ; - corporate welfare for the military-industrial complex . . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:31 pm | The role is very clear , protect civilians . \nIts been emphasized that there will be no US boots on the soil and that the transition of power will be passed . \nThe fact the president has not made an official statement until today and still its a little unclear to some people is irrelevant since the average american thinks we 're already engaged in a 3rd war and has n't been paying attention . \nThe news keep on asking and speculating what the role of the US military will be if the rebels become offensive , and the role will be to continue to protect civilians . \nI 'm not sure how many times it needs to said and regurgitated . \nAlso with the comparison to the Iraq no fly zone , I feel this is drastically different . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:31 pm | I understand what is going on in Libya from watching CNN . \nCNN has done a remarkable job at telling the entire story by interviewing the military leaders , the courageous reporters that are witnessing and in the midst of this event , and the innocent civilians that are suffering from their EVIL leader . \nObama is trying something new . \nWe will see if it works . \nI feel sorry for our leader . \nDamned if they do and damned if they do n't . \nWhere is our national pride ? \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:32 pm | What we have here is Failure to Listen . \nWanting Gadhafi to step down -LRB- `` out '' -RRB- does not directly translate to war . \nAnd yet McCain was fully prepared to rock 'n roll early on . \nI have had no problem understanding what our President 's mission is all about . \nIt is definitely rooted in diplomacy backed by the military in concert with the United Nations as warranted -LRB- no-fly zone -RRB- -- not a unilateral measure . \nAll this frenzy about what is the US going to do to get Gadhafi out . \nThis is how we have gotten into trouble in the past . \nThe US is not the ruler of the world -- not its police force . \nAnd as far as the Congress claiming they were not adequately consulted ; the US did not declare WAR . \nLet 's revisit Reagan & Libya . \nLastly , does any reasonable person think the US is going to lay all the cards on the table -- not so much . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:32 pm | US role is very clear -- No-fly zone to allow the people of Libya to assert their well -- and provide humanitarian relief . \nPatience people , patience -- we are only in day 3 . \nThose who do not understand simply are posturing for elections , to have a spot in the news , and to be different . \nIf one needs to be different at the expense of our national security , one need to examine their priorities . \nIf Libya leader remains in power , the future will be bleak as he will certainly feel invincible and launched a renewed set of threats . \nWe understand , trust the American People understand . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:32 pm | President Obama has made very clear statements regarding the US role in the Libyan situation . \nWe are acting with UN approval and joining a team response from both Europe and the Arab League to protect civilians who were being slaughtered . \nThe international community took too long to act , but finally is coming to the rescue of Libyans . \nWe should support this action . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:32 pm | Libya was n't going to go back to the way it was before some of their people revolted , so we went to the UN , got some tenative backing to intervene , and are now leveling the playing field for the Libyan resistence . \nPerhaps more of their military leaders will defect to the resistence like they did in Yemen . \nThey 'd only risk doing so if they had a better chance of winning . \nThat was n't going to happen against Qaddafi 's formerly superior forces . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:32 pm | To me the role of US is to sacrifice again to help the kind of the people who are so forgetful and soon chant against USA and burn the flag ! \nHaving said that I still support the president 's decision specially knowing this fact that the mad man would level the opposition cities to ground as soon as he gets there and by opposition I refer to very ordinary people who demand nothing but a sliver of the freedom that is so basic to us we do n't even appreciate . \nComing from Middle East myself , I can very well relate to them . \nAnd for those who say US should step away and let the opposition take over on their own I refer them to the happy and grateful reactions of the people of Benghazi who were hopelessly waiting for Qaddafi forces to conquer the city and introduce them to their dark destiny . \nWhy do some of us say we should n't have stopped the genocide when the direct help is what the poor people themselves demand ? \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:32 pm | Our role could not be more obvious nor , for that matter , more clearly explained by the President . \nWe are involved in a United Nations effort to protect civilians who are extremely vulnerable but who have nonetheless joined together to rid themselves of a long time dictator . \nIf they could vote they would do this differently , but they ca n't vote . \nThis uprising is the only means available to them . \nWe are acting in a supportive role to the UN effort . \nWe have capabilities in the region which are not duplicated by anyone else and we would shamefully remiss were we not to make them available . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:33 pm | He has proved once again that his policies do n't defer from Pres. Bush 's We have no business in the Libyan civil war . \nI do n't think we have the moral authority to judge anybod . \nHow about regime change right here at home . \nI voted for Obama now I can not wait for him to go . \nI understand the role of the US , Allies , and the 22 Arab Nations is to protect `` those Lybians '' who are under attack from Kadafi . \nTo all the critic 's who are COMFORTABLY and cowardly sitting and complaining , I can only say to them `` Action speaks louder than words '' I applaud our President 's actions and involvement to protect the rights of the people of Lybia to get rid of Kadafi and choose their own Government . \nWARS !! what is to understand . \nnow we are in 3 . \njapan 's nuclear reactors are trashed . \nWe ca n't get straight answers anywhere . \nPeople are asked to give and give ... Countries promised to help haiti and renigged on their promise . \nBut we are asked to give . \nUS ranked 22 in the corruption index -LRB- canada was 6th -RRB- . \nwe are paying more taxes so the government can go to war . \nWhat about my job ? \nWhat about my health ? \nHow about a living wage for me ? \nThe laws are made and the loopholes are found ! \nThe US needs to take care of the US ? \nHow many years since we heard of an honest politician ? \nThen maybe it needs to be fixed . \nWAR , like I care . \nI want to know what is in my water , food and air . \nAnd whether I am going to die tomorrow because of some stupid company 's greed . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:33 pm | I am just amazed about how selective is America in chosen which country to attack in this Middle East and North African Crisis . \nFor God sake , Iran did the same to its People , Bahrain , Yemen , you name them . \nBut it seems that we select the weaker and who we do n't like . \nWhat if Saudi Arabia or France does the same ? \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:33 pm | America ca n't continue to say we stand with those who are fighting for freedom and democracy and when they ask for our help we do nothing . \nI think this mission is putting Iran on notice . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:33 pm | President Obama did the right thing , with what we knew and what time there was to act . \nIf he had waited for the congress to get their act together , the city of Benghazi would have been leveled already . \nThis was a no-brainer , with the backing from countries all around the globe ! \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:33 pm | I am under the impression that USA did not initiate the attack on Lybia . \nI heard President Sarkosy on Saturday ; he sent France 's planes , the first to attack Lybian military vehicles on that day . \nMost of the United nations members are involved including America . \nI felt that President Obama had reluctantly agreed to participate on a humanitarian principle , stating that no American troops would be on the Lybian soil . \nThis said , I personally disagree with these attacks . \nI doubt the rest of the Arab countries approve them . \nWho knows how they are goint to react . \nThis is grave and regrettable . \nNothing in politics happens by accident . \nAll the preamble was a cover to allow the USA to put their exact plan in place and all is going according to that plan . \nLibya will be seen as a International assisted effort by the White House and Libya will have a new leader and it will not be Gadhafi and the new one will sing praises for the support from the America who will in turn thank the coalition . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:34 pm | The US and allied role in Libya is to provide stability to the world markets . \nThe Tsunami in Japan and the impending nuclear issue there is already affecting the markets and the worldwide recovery . \nIf the oil prices are allowed to increase over speculation , the US economic recovery will come to a halt and this can not be allowed . \none other thing , we do care about the libyan people being slaughtered and want that to stop too . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:34 pm | Where are all the `` death to America '' chants that come out of the Middle East whenever we do anything ? \nFor once , the Arab street is happy with us . \nWhatever the leaders of the Arab countries say is immaterial , as they are all in trouble internally . \nIt 's funny watching these repressive regimes support the rebellion . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:34 pm | First of all this is nothing like Iraq . \n1 - George bush took us into a war based upon lies of weapons of mass disctuction . \n2 - 1973 says we are there to protect the civilian population . \nCadafi has used his military , his police , and his spies to attack civilians . \nGetting rid of Cadafi , and protecting civilians , is one in the same . \nIf Cadafi stays in power then the population of Libya suffers , he must go . \nThe President did inform the congress that if the UN resolution passed that there would be swift action , as it should be . \n2 - We did not lead the attack against Cadafi , the French did . \n3 - The military operates under the control of the commander in chief . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:34 pm | President Obama acted too slowly up until he acted too fast ? \nGive him a break here . \nI personally do not find it hard to understand that the airways above Libya are being controlled so that the Libyan people do not have get killed wholesale . \nTalking heads are making this far too complicated . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:34 pm | It 's very simple . \nOur role is to inforce resolution 1973 . \nTo allow the Libian people a level planning field to determine their own future . \nThey want their dictaor out and a new government in . \nThe president also said it is `` US policy '' that Gadafi must go ! \nIs that really a surprise for anyone ?? With all he has done , does anyone really think he should stay ? \nThe Libian people will be able to accomplish this with the resolution being sucessful . \nBut please , it has only been two days why are we talking end game ... it just started ! \nDo we really think the President or Military leaders should come on programs to outline exactly what they intend to do ?? Let them do the job you elected them to do and just report what HAS happened ... do n't speculate or make the news . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:34 pm | I believe the United States role in the Libya offensive is what Barack Obama says , `` protect the Innocent people of Libya '' . \nHow are we doing it ? \nBy air force and and Navy , what ever they can do there going to do it along with the other countries involved with `` Operation Odyssey Dawn '' organized by the U.N. . \nIt is good that the U.S is involved , we look to help seek the peace and democracy in the countries that want it . \nWe have already helped in 6 other Arab countries , why not go on if they let us ? \nWhich is what the oppositional force is wanting , but not just with the U.S but the U.N. . \nAs for taking out Moammar Gadhafi , we shouldnt because its not apart of `` Operation Odyssey Dawn '' , we should let the people of Libya decide that them selves . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:35 pm | The US is holding up oil prices at the expense of Libya . \nThe oil supplies are being supported by speculators that are supported by the government , with the event in Japan , oil price were in the processes of retreating into the 80 dollar range . \nBuy attacking Libya , they are supporting the prices of oil . \nLibya is an African country , not the middle east countr , the African congress did not support this intervention . \nThe Arab countries and European countries will make gains if they can take the libyan oil off the market and Europe will benifit if they can gain control and sell the oil from Libya . \nSame as they did in Iraq , all these military actions cost the taxpayer in higher oil prices and more debt ! \nThis may not be about politics but it is about politics . \nFollowing the U.N. resolution on Libya puts Pres. Obama in the usual unenvable `` damned if you do and damed if you do n't '' situation . \nThose not in the decision-making situation can take pot shots . \nLater they can say nothing if things go right or `` see , I told you '' if a perception arises that the situation has gone awry . \nIn my way of thinking one supports the decisions of those you asked for a decision in the first place , i.e. , the UN and Pres. Obama . \nNo one gets guarantees . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:35 pm | Libya is an European problem . \nNothing to do with the USA . \nIf there were problems in Mexico or Cuba , would the world expect Europe to come and do something about it ? \nAre we the policemen of the world ? \nCan we afford it ? \nIf the UN is so impotent , get rid of it ASAP ! \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:35 pm | My understanding is that we have the largest military in the world and we love to show it off . \nI also understand that the president is less interested in civil rights for Americans and much more interested in civil rights of citizens of another nation . \nThere must be a billionaire in the U.S. getting rich from manufacturing bombs . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:36 pm | Jack it is just simply a stupide moved from the Obama administration it seem like we hav n't learned from Iraq or we just do n't learn . \nLet the french deal with it . \nDee from New Mexico March 21 , 2011 at 5:36 pm | What is the nature of the Arab League 's opposition to Khadaffi and why are we so willing to jump through their hoop ? \nSurely there are no great supporters of democracy to be found in the league , and in truth we have seemed more interested in exporting McKinley era capitalism to the 3rd World than in exporting democracy , which as we can all attest can be troublesome . \nFarrakhan 's comments the other day raised at least one interesting point : What is the nature of the unrest and whose interests does it serve ? \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:37 pm | I am a staunch conservative and I 'm as eager to help the cause of freedom and liberty as anyone . \nHowever , I 'm also a hearty cynic and firmly believe in the law of unintended consequences , which always seems to bite the USA in the butt . \nWe may not like the guy or his policies , but the fact remains , Gadhafi is the sitting ruler of a sovereign state . \nThe UN , with our full cooperation , has set the precedent of assisting an armed mob rebelling against their own government . \nWhile I tentatively support these unknown rebels in this case , are nations now to be punished for attempting to defeat armed civilian protesters attempting to overthrow their government ? \nWhat happens when this occurs in a nation we DO N'T despise ? \nHow can we protest something we have already supported ? \nWhat if it 's one of our allies ? \nGod forbid , what if it 's us ? \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:37 pm | I am confused as to why everyone is ` confused ' , -- do you people not listen to your own reports ??? Do you not listen to President Obama 's speeches , which you carry -- he has outlined & explained it all thoroughly a ` number ' of times now ? \nIf you ca n't understand it , perhaps you should all play them over & over again until you do . \nAs far as properly informing the Congress , -- he did that too , remember the meeting at the White House ??? What did Congress expect -- that he should refer it to ` them ' to decide , by striking a few ` bi-partisan committees ' , to discuss it until after the next election ??? Get Real ! \nThey ca n't even decide on ` last year 's budget ' . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:37 pm | My understanding is that we are going to break the back of Libyan military by bombing their convoys and destroying their CnC capabilities . \nAfter that , the Europeans take over the patrolling of Libyan airspace , denying Gadaffi any chance to regroup . \nIn the meantime , we release the frozen $ 30 billion in Libyan assets and let the rebels buy European\\/American weaponry to take Gadaffi out on their own . \nThe end game is Gadaffi and his sons either dead or in autocrat central in Saudi Arabia , a fractious but inward looking Libyan government in power and oil supply resumed . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:37 pm | The height of hypocrisy in the West is Libya . \nNo point in stating the obvious -LRB- oil -RRB- but it sure would be nice if there was a little equity and transparency with regards to the West 's policies on the continent of Africa . \nAnyone remember Ivory Coast , Gabon , Djibouti ... is there interest in helping the good people of these countries achieve the same goals that the Egyptians , Tunisians , and Libyans have ? \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:37 pm | Your comment is awaiting moderation . \nThe missile attacks on Lybia were : 1 . \nIniated and agreed upon by the United Nations Security Council ; 2 . \nThe United States did not act alone . \nObama acted as part of a united coalition of allies including Arab nations , England , France , etc. 3 . \nThe air strikes were aimed at military weapon 's sites in Lybia -- not on Kadafi or innocent civilians ; I do believe the United States should not conduct a war by itself !! I feel strongly that participation in a United Nations `` peace-keeping '' response to the subversive indiscriminate violence against innocent civilians and protesters MUST BE ADDRESSED . \nSeems pretty clear to me . \nFreeze assets , get a coalition together , sanction the hell of of Libya , diminish Gadahfi 's ability to get the upper hand , and let the opposition rise up while also providing humanitarian aid . \nDo people not listen at all ?? I really do n't understand the confusion . \nThe President has been very clear on his position from the start . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:38 pm | Our strategic role is clear and obvious . \nTo stop the mass killing of civilians . \nI believe the part about not wanting to remove Kadafi is for press releases . \nOf course it is to remove Kadafi . \nBeyond that wise men do not go . \nFirst because paraphrasing Eisenhower , Plans do not survive the first day . \nAfter that is is dictated by facts on the ground . \nSo Obama can not box himself in by declaring we will do such and such exactly . \nEven if he could , he should not . \nIt is wise not to telegraph your punches and leave the enemy guessing . \nMy guess is the Republican noise machine knows all this and are just trying to stay relevant . \nI also expected and have seen that NO FLY means NO HEAVY ARMS . \nWe will destroy all tanks , heavy artillery , etc , in the field . \nWe will destroy all means of antiaircraft . \nWe will destroy Command and Control infrastructure . \nAnd I suspect we are doing more than a share of Cyber War as well to screw up his planning and control . \nAll these things must be included if you are to convince Kadafi that the jig is up . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:38 pm | We can not afford , no matter the reason , to fire off over 100 Tomahawk missles all in the name of liberty . \nAlthough I am siding with the rebels , they have to do this on their own . \nOur military might has been stretched to the limit and is reaching its breaking point . \nWe need to put an end to these mindless politicians in washington who want to flex our muscles at any sign of trouble . \nI say at this point that for every single bullet we fire in Libya , the politicians in Washington should take one dollar off of their pay and stop making us pay for something that we had absolutely no say in . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:38 pm | U.S. or U.N. should not take the action such as bombing any nation without provocation . \nThe socalled opposition in Libya were never protesting peacefully and how do you deal with armed rebels who went on , attacking , burning and destroying police and army headquarters . \nThey are no more considered harmless civilians when they are armed and destructive . \nI am not in anyway condoning any tyranic ruler but you should make any bad situation worse for your own selfish interest . \nThe money US is wasting in this offensive action could be used to house millions of homeless Americans . \nObama should remember his promise of constructive dialogue with people that we disagree with . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:39 pm | I understand and approve of the No-fly zone and missile attacks on military targets . \nWe cant sit back and let a mad man kill his own people because they want human rights . \nObama did a great job of waiting for and securing a coalition of many nations . \nAnd it is brilliant to hand over command to a coalition commander so as not to seem as the US attacking alone another muslin nation . \nI only wonder why he did n't have to ask congress for authorization like Bush did before Iraq . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:39 pm | My understanding is that France and the UK have been itching for an opportunity to try out their Eurofighter in a live fire training mission . \nI feel Obama was pressured into this . \nThere is no real goal here , only doing `` something '' for the sake of training . \nQuite an expensive fireworks show - each of those 120 + tomahawks cost 3.5 mil . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:40 pm | We went in Libya for the same reason we should 've gone into Sudan long ago . \nIs n't it interesting that America is only obsessed with overthrowing dictators in countries that are rich in oil ? \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:40 pm | Jack this is a civil war , we should let them work out their own problems , who do we think we are , we are not responsible for the world , leave them alone , we should work on diplomacy with the leaders of other countries after they decide who they should be . \nJapan needs our help , I do n't want my tax dollars going to another Arab country , when they hate us . \nThey want our help tell them to pay us back in oil . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:41 pm | The more I watch this play out the more I think Obama is simply trying to prevent the Europeans from making matters worse . \nThe Europeans have made it clear in certain circles that they are terrified of a massive refugee crisis engulfing Europe in general and France in particular . \nAdd to that the fact that Sarkozy made a fool of himself during the Tunisia\\/Egypt affairs and is looking for a way to recover from that and it was almost assured that France and other like-minded European countries were going to act whether the US cared to or not . \nIt s important to remind ourselves that North Africans in Europe are like Latinos in America : A powerful minority . \nSeeing as how Gadhfi would see an attack from Europe as an attack from America anyways Obama likely concluded that the lesser of two evils was to make sure this silliness played out as best it could . \nAnd for that to happen you needed 112 Tomahawk missiles , among other things . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:42 pm | Much like Hans Solo -LRB- coalition forces -RRB- clearing the way for a young Luke Skywalker -LRB- Libyan `` rebels '' -RRB- to take the shot that would end the death star , the United States -LRB- along with Coalition forces -RRB- are in Libya to protect those Libyans who wish to live a free and peaceable existence by ensuring that they be allowed to begin a new Libya void of tyranny . \nIf they so desire , it will be the people of Libya which will remove Moammar Gadhafi , not the United States or Coalition forces . \nWe will be there only as an empowering body . \nI do n't care for Obama 's politics , but I do think this has a very good chance to succeed . \nIt keeps our presence and internal meddling to a minimum -LRB- troops and $ - diplomacy did n't stand a chance -RRB- , and allows the people to rise up and form a government -LRB- that hopefully resembles our Republic -RRB- while protecting them physically all the while they move forward towards that endeavor . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:42 pm | The United States and its allies will not commit ground forces to the operation in Libya . \nThe United States seeks to support the rebels and isolate Gadaffi 's support base into a small corridor around Tripoltania . \nFrom there , Gadaffi will be unable to fly in any more mercenaries , and will be cut off from his supplies . \nFrom there , Gadaffi and his support base will collapse , and the people of Libya will change the government . \nWe will not appoint a leader . \nThat part is up to the people of Libya . \nStrom in Charleston , South Carolina March 21 , 2011 at 5:43 pm | My understanding is to go in , take out the weapons that could be used to kill the civilians and let the other UN partners take over . \nBut , lets face it . \nIt does n't matter what Obama says , does , does n't say , does n't do , Republicans will highly criticize his every move . \nThis guy ca n't breathe without someone taking a stand on how appalled they are by that behavior . \nDemocrats are not much better . \nDo n't these politicians know they are so obvious it 's sickening ? \nLets get rid of them all and start over again . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:43 pm | Our goal is simple , to protect civilians from being killed by their leader whom our President says must go and who we are not authorized to remove . \nWe will succeed in not removing this leader by means of a No-Fly-Zone , which will effectively reduce the leader s ground assets by actively targeting objects that don t fly . \nTo avoid unilateral condemnation of our actions by the Arab world , we will be led in absentia by one of them , so that the others may criticize us for the actions they have authorized . \nWe will know we have successfully achieved our goal , when the leader we have not removed periodically makes statements verifying that he is still in power , that his armored vehicles are no longer capable of flying , and that he has the support of his neighboring nations , who , by the way , unanimously condemn the abominable actions we have taken on our own . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:43 pm | It 's not just the NFZ , I guess we were also hoping for a no-drive-zone . \nThe tanks before Zintan and Misrata are destroying the cities , making holes into the civilian buildings , kiling on sight anyone attempting to get out then , with hundreds of snipers on each roof of each house taken from its families . \nYou must continue to help us as long as our new legit authorities ask you to -LRB- which btwm every country out there needs to recognize ASAP -RRB- , please , if only to redeem yourselves from the dark shadow of the happenings in Iraq still hauting you as you come to help us with the accord of the Arab league and the permission of the UN . \nI have lost so many of my family in Zawia and still do not know what 's become of the rest of the family as I can not contact them yet . \nThere is enough hell with the thousands of armed mercenaries killing about 400 per day everywhere for the past month . \nPlease do n't make this anymore difficult on the Libyan people , it 's bad enough they had to ask for this help , beg for it for a month , long enough for 13 000 of the bravest , youngest to be gone . \nIf the Libyans thinks their allies have crossed a line , they will say it . \nSo far we 're naively trusting the world , but also sending our message of hope for peace with a voice that can not leave anyone indifferent . \nGaddafi has to go , worry not about hitting him by accident , we wo n't feel too bad about it . \nAnd please arm the freedom fighters , they need to come save the West side of the country turned into a giant prison with executions and tortured and rape being practiced on a regular bases in this blocade . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:44 pm | Jack , I 'm confused too . \nWhat the president calls `` the U.S. policy on Lybia '' is somewhat different from the UN resolution . \nThe last thing this country needs is another war . \nThese so-called coalition forces are in it for now and we all know it 's gonna end up being an American war . \nMy advise , do n't do it Mr. President . \nAnd honestly , these guys in Lybia totally deviated from the model used by their fellow Middle Easterns in Tunisian and Egypt . \nThose were peaceful movements and this one in Lybia is anything but peaceful . \nThey started this war and now they want us to go fight it for them . \nThey should have copied Egypt and maybe we would n't have gotten to this point . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:45 pm | Well once again we 're sticking our nose in where it does not belong , the same things are going on in Yemen , Bahrain and Syria , are we going to do same thing is those countries ? \nAnd the reason congress was `` nt told of this is because it was not an announcement of war . \nthat is the only time they need to be notified . \nAnd as far as impeachment , HA HA HA , I can only laugh at that threat , by the time they pull that off Obama 's term will be done and we will have another knucklehead in office to deal with . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:46 pm | I think the US -LRB- 1 -RRB- is limiting the ability of a hated dictator to kill his opponents `` like rats , house tot house , room to room , '' -LRB- 2 -RRB- has widespread support , even from the Arab League , -LRB- 3 -RRB- has no plans to invade Libya . \nWhatever any US president does will be bitterly opposed by some groups . \nIn this case I think the incumbent is doing the right thing . \nWith Benghazi about to fall , he had to act quickly . \nAt least Obama does not seem to have lied , as Bush the Younger did to start a war . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:46 pm | We 're committed with the French and Britain , with the ok by the Arab League to fulfill the UN resolution of bringing a halt to Ghadaffi 's upcoming slaughter of his people . \nThe guy went on international TV and told the world he would show his own people ` no mercy . ' \nAre we supposed to pretend that did n't happen ? \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:46 pm | Our purpose is to help the Libyian people further their aim toward democracy . \nWithout our military actions against Gadhafi 's army , it will never happen . \nHowever , this will not mean that once Gadhafi is gone everyone will become law abiding citizens and vote freely . \nIt took the United States over 400 years to achieve the democratic reforms we cherish today . \nLibiya has a very long , long way to go ... March 21 , 2011 at 5:47 pm | There is NO strategy for the attack on Libya . \nGaddafi has gas and vast military resources at his disposal , more than 75,000 troops , planes , rockets , tanks , etc. . \nHe will not leave Libya without trying to destroy everything and kill everyone that opposes him . \nThe coalition forces are shooting at targets when they do n't know what they are aiming at because they lack the intelligence , ask Admiral Mullen . \nThe U.S. has spent hundreds of millions of US Dollars already to waive the sword , without any goal or real commitment that we have agreed to in consensus . \nGaddafi has forced Pres. Obama 's hand to act prematurely and without a clear strategy , and the President , unfortunately , has made irrational decisions for appearances sake . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:48 pm | Here 's the deal . \nI 'm a military member , our job is to help uphold the ideals of free nations and prevent crimes against humanity ; that is if we are acting with the UN and NATO forces . \nI volunteered for service and went to Afghanistan and Iraq with the intent on helping bring down a terrorist network that helped kill thousands of our civilians . \nTheir crimes against humanity itself was enough to make me fight . \nOil , land , and power had nothing to do with why I went . \nMaybe for other people but not me . \nIf Libya 's military is killing civilians let me in first . \nI will gladly go first . \nIt 's the type of person I am . \nTo me , we 're going because atrocities are being committed . \nIt needs to stop , and it needs to stop right now . \nGod Bless the USA . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:48 pm | With the ground swell of middle-eastern youth taking to the streets in protest over lack of basic freedoms , they saw what was achieved in Egypt as possible for their own countries . \nFortunately in Egypt , Mubarak did n't turn his military on his own people and their revolution succeeded . \nUnlike Egypt , Gadhafi is hell bent on holding power and killing anyone who protests against him . \nHis recent successes in quashing the demonstrations and rebels was nearing completion . \nWithout the U.N. -LRB- our -RRB- intervention , it would give license to all the long-term rulers to do the same to their people . \nTherefore , Obama 's and our allies aim is to send a message to the rest of the Arab world , that we will intercede on behalf of democracy . \nIn the eyes of those middle eastern youth and in the U.S. , the President had waited too -LRB- a necessary step to get the UN to go along -RRB- long to support the Libyan rebellion . \nThis was putting political pressure on him by Republicans and members of his own party . \nThe decision to intervene or not , was weighed , and now the President is firmly focused on the outcome . \nHe pictures pictures a future Libya without Gadhafi just as George Bush saw a future Iraq with Saddam Hussein . \nThe die is cast . \nFinally , this also sends a big message to Hugo Chavez in Venezuela . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:48 pm | Protect the Lybian civilians . \nMake sure the Gaddafi regime retreats . \n-LRB- opposition & regime -RRB- I have just found by CNN that U.S. policy is for Gaddafi to go . \nThats what I understand . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:48 pm | My understanding is that a lot of people agree that Gadhafi is a loose cannon in a country that controls vital resources . \nHis attempts to put down Libya 's uprising against him have given these many nations an excuse , albeit thinly veiled , to remove him from power while claiming to be only there to protect the citizens of Libya . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:49 pm | U.S. or U.N. should not take the action such as bombing any nation without provocation . \nThe socalled opposition in Libya were never protesting peacefully and how do you deal with armed rebels who went on , attacking , burning and destroying police and army headquarters . \nThey are no more considered harmless civilians when they are armed and destructive . \nI am not in anyway condoning any tyranic ruler but we should not make any bad situation worse for our own selfish interest . \nThe money US is wasting in this offensive action could be used to house millions of homeless Americans . \nObama should remember his promise of constructive dialogue with people that we disagree with . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:49 pm | I would hope we are interested in preventing the Libyan people that are speaking up from being killed ... which is sort of what has been proposed . \nThe old saying `` if you ca n't do something smart , at least do something that 's right '' or as my dad says ... `` do something !! '' March 21 , 2011 at 5:49 pm | Our role stop the killing of innocent civilians , use the resources the other nations did n't have . \nNow we level the playing field , allow the rest of nations pick up the job . \nAs to the Congress & Speaker saying they do n't understand ... Our President speaks very clear , distinct ENGLISH . \nHe , President Obama was cautious , prudent and willing to consult with members of Congress , his cabinet prior to taking any action . \nHe Listen , then ACTED . \nNot like the rest -LRB- Palin , Rep. -RRB- who want to strike , shoot and then wonder now what . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:50 pm | Jack , political and economic opportunism never seems to cease , anywhere . \nWhen one considers the plurality of brutal regimes the US has both partnered with and propped up , it was incumbent upon the US to not act unilaterally in the Libyan case . \nI fully support your efforts there . \nThey are just , they were pleaded for by the people you are helping and clearly they were needed . \nMy question is how is it possible when there are such gains to be made in the hearts and minds of people the world over , that some in your Congress have the need to shout down the good work done in the name of the suppressed . \nThose politicians are sheer opportunists and should be seen as such . \nThey have nothing to add to the mix except division . \nIt is high time that one nation on this planet started to act like its ' forefathers wanted it to , that is to truly act in the name democracy and the inevitable freedom that results from it . \nActing on behalf of people who can clearly judge the true nature of any intervention is the most important criteria in determining ` national strategic interest ' . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:50 pm | Our job ? \nDrop a few bombs , hopefully take out a crazed weasel of a dictator and then come home . \nLet the rest of the countries do the heavy lifting for a change . \nBut we went in there to prevent a slaughter . \nGood job for Pres Obama . \nGood Job for Our Military Heroes . \nGood on ya to the Libyan people . \nWe 've cleared the way , now go kick Gadhafi 's butt . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:51 pm | My understanding of America 's role in Libya is what ever works for us . \nThere is no clear messages from Wasington or from UN . \nAnd where is press confrence of France leader 's . \nWe were told before the strike that France is the leading coalition froce . \nI understand that we are being lied again by our GOVT . \nand media is very good job of not doing its job -LRB- remember Iraq war -RRB- . \nFree pass to Mr. Bush 's policy towards Iraq . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:51 pm | Hillary Clinton and Bob Gates are not potted plants . \nThe US is trying to stop Gadhafi fom reasserting control over the country and is trying to provide breathing space for the rebels so that they can regroup and gain control over the whole country . \nThe US would like to not have this seen as a US operation in the same Iraq and Afghanistan are . \nThis makes sense unless you are a Republican politician looking to score political point . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:52 pm | My understanding is that the US government is messaging that these strikes are meant to protect innocents from military action by Gadhafi . \nHowever , my understanding is also that our government has no concrete plan as to an suitable ending ... nor do they really know who the rebels are that they are assisting . \nI also understand that there is little agreement with these actions amongst the real countries that should be helping Lybia : Libya 's neighbors . \nAre these rebels really the people we want having an upper hand in Libya ? \nNo one seems to be asking this question . \nThe U.S. and its allies are trying to prevent Gaddafi from overwhelming and killing off the Libyan opposition . \nIt 's a worthwhile operation . \nImmediate action was necessary . \nKucinich is an idiot who should n't even be in Congress . \nLugar knows good and well what this is about - stopping a massacre - but he 's being difficult . \nIf we had waited on Lugar to satisfy his qualms , we 'd be listening to the screams of Gaddafi 's victims in Benghazi . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:52 pm | Please support our president and stand united againist this terrorist the Queddafi and his family . \nCNN stop all the analysis and sending messages to the butcher of Libya that we are not united on this we are united the american are , we are the leaders of the world , lets get rid of him once of all . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:52 pm | Our role is to help the rebels in a civil war in Libya . \nThe 2 % of the worlds oil that Libya produces is not the reason we are there . \nWhat I really do n't understand is why the Arab League of Nations requested NATO to set up a No Fly zone ! \nThe 22 members of the Arab League spends $ 50.2 Billion a year on their military . \nThey have F-14s , F-15s . \nF-16s , and F-18s with the best air to air missiles that money can buy . \nWhy do they ask NATO to step in and then complain about the resulting actions ? \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:52 pm | First it was Iraq oil . \nWe killed hundreds of thousands and razed the country . \nAll lies were tolded . \nBrits and France wants to control Libya oil . \nTo save the people of Libya is a lie and we are a party to it . \nUN is always high jacked by first world countries for their sinful activities . \nYour comment is awaiting moderation . \nFirst of all this is nothing like Iraq . \n1 - George bush took us into a war based upon lies of weapons of mass disctuction . \n2 - 1973 says we are there to protect the civilian population . \nGaddafi has used his military , his police , and his spies to attack civilians . \nGetting rid of Gaddafi , and protecting civilians , is one in the same . \nIf Gaddafi stays in power then the population of Libya suffers , he must go . \nThe President did inform the congress that if the UN resolution passed that there would be swift action , as it should be . \n2 - We did not lead the attack against Gaddafi , the French did . \n3 - The military operates under the control of the commander in chief . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:53 pm | This is the right time for the US and its allies to support the people of North Africa and the Middle Eastern countries for gaining their freedom to choose their future for economic prosperity and education for all men and women . \nThis is our time to help the people in that region to eliminate the rule of feudalism and dictatorship from the whole region . \nThese centuries old suppression of the people in the name of religion is not helping those people to see the lights of their lives with science and technology . \nIt is the responsibility of the West to help them get out of the darkness of brutality and tyranny of their dictatorship so that they can build their better future . \nThey must learn the value of democracy and freedom with good education and science such as Israel to make the country prosperous and strong . \nThey must learn from their neighbor Israel how to build a great nation starting from zero . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:56 pm | I believe the United States ' power and supiorority was called out , and tested by an ignorent old man . \nI 've watched it unfold , and cant help but notice that its mostly about ego 's . \nThat old man 's ego , `` he called on nuclear bombs '' , and Hillary Clintons ego , '' having to defend the United States supiorority '' . \nI know the United States wants to stop the killing of the libian citizens , but it does seem selective considering the turmoil all over the region . \nHello , Bahrain . . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:56 pm | Our role in LIbya is to soak up some of those excess tax dollars that might otherwise go to something frivolous , like education or helping the elderly pay for their heating bills . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:56 pm | Dover , DE . . \nThis is another sad decision on the part of the American government . \nIf we have personal issues with Gadhafi , we should handle it in a different manner instead of support rebels as a way of retaliation . \nHere are the problems : 1 . \nThe mission is not defined . \nWhat is the definition of victory for this mission or when will it end . \nWe do not have any direct connection with the rebel group . \nI thought we should have learned enough lessons from Iraq , Afghanistan , and other wars , and learn to better approach issues such as this . \nIf Russia or China -LRB- who are not part of the coalition -RRB- decides to support Gadhafi , where are we headed ? \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:56 pm | What we understand and what the coalition forces understand are two different things . \nIn addition , each member of the coalition forces ' military have a different objective all together , but one they will not share with other members of the same coalition . \nThere is no doubt that every person that has been around since the 70 's understands that Colonel Gaddafi is one of the most saddistic dictators in the history of the modern world . \nSo , we would like this man 's dictatorship to end . \nHowever , Libya is a sovereign nation , and like many other nations that have suffered through the pain , blood shed , or all the other nasty aspects of civil war , Libya has to endure it themselves . \nNow , the nations of the world can assist our Libyan brothers , just as France assisted the United States , to fight those that oppress them . \nOne thing is for sure : Blood will be spilled , and in some cases , Libyans will raise arms against their Libyan brothers . \nThis because there are supporters of Gaddafi , and of course there are those who oppose him . \nBut the notion that this will be resoved without the shedding of human blood , unfortunately is incorrect . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:56 pm | France has influenced the US into this war and now we are stack with another deficit . \nWe did that in Iraq , Afghanistan , and now Libya . \nYemen , Qatar , or even Syria . \nThe amount the US is spending in this wars should be use to solve problems of mortgage melt down or pay off some mortgages held by jobless Americans as a goodwill . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:57 pm | I believe Pres. Obama wanted nothing to do with this No-Fly business , but he and his European friends realized that it was going to be IMPOSSIBLE without the help of the United States of America . \nSure the French made a show by sending a few aircraft over Libya and the Brits fired off a few missiles , but the only nation that has the ability to put the whole package together is the USA . \nThis is perhaps more important than the situation in Libya at this moment . \nIt literally means that Europe is so combat ineffective they can t police anything beyond their own borders . \nObama had no choice but to back up his European allies and their oil supply , no matter whether Libya has anything to do with direct US interest . \nOtherwise , Europe would have been exposed as the empty shell militaries they are March 21 , 2011 at 5:58 pm | The President made it clear . \nClear to anyone besides the Right who turn a deaf ear and closed mind when it comes to anything the President does . \nJust as with health care reform the President could have explained it for a year and they would still be saying they do n't understand it . \nIt was made clear that we are merely there to implement a no fly zone and protect the citizens from attacks by the military . \nNo ground troops just help taking out air defenses and providing logistical support . \nTranslated for the Right `` We 're going to blow up airports and radar and help our allies -LRB- friends -RRB- plan further action . \nOnly the right could be in the dark . \nMaybe Gov.

March 21 , 2011 at 5:58 pm | Is there any difference between what Europe did to Asian and African countries in the 19th century and what the US and Europe is doing in the 21st century to Libya , Iraq , and other countaries of Asia and Africa ? \nGoals are same but the methods are more deadly . \nExactly same shameless colonialism and imperialism . \nNo change at all ! \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:58 pm | The wold needs to be rid of Gaddafi , I am affraid that at this point , all the coalition forces have done is give us hope and help out a little . \nWe really expected a lot more , a lot more quickly . \nToo many people are still dying in Misrata , Zintan notably today . \nTripoli , Zawia and all cities in the West are trapped by Pro-Gaddafi forces , they are going through the worst of things . \nOf course , we know the world helping us today is probably not parading its armies without any interests expected . \nBut if anything , just the fact they might help erase some of their sins in Iraq makes this worth believing in . \nNaive , perhaps , it takes a lot of that to uphold principles of freedom and justice at the cost of thousands of lives . \nLet the Libyans choose , they 've hard earned the right . \nIt 's their risk to take , it 's their people to save . \nHelp them ANYWAY you can , arm them , send them humanitarian aids of all kind , they are in dire need of support , whatever you think you 're doing to help , it 's STILL NOT ENOUGH . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:58 pm | Americans are funny and sad all at the same time . \nYou whine `` we 're not the world police '' -- and now that the UN is leading you whine '' why is the UN telling us what to do '' . \nThe US role in Libya is quite clearly laid out , by President Obama , by S of S Clinton , by Resolution 1973 . \nThe leaders of Congress were in the `` loop '' . \nWas the President supposed to phone each individual member and get their opinion ? \nI thought the Republicans thought he was dithering and moving too slow ? \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:59 pm | If the only way of stopping libyan troops , by order of Gaddafi , from continuously trying to eliminate any human resistance to his policies is to take out command and control elements , then this should be supported . \nNow , since the command is coming directly from the top of the `` command and control '' elements , I do n't understand why media , and others , do not understand that , yes , while Gaddafi is not a target , he may just `` have to go '' . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 5:59 pm | Normally a pacifist , I am in complete support of UN -LRB- and US -RRB- actions . \nI have been watching CNN a lot due to recent events , and thanks to CNN , feel clear enough . \nMy understanding of US 's role is exactly what Pres. Obama stated today in Chile , that the military actions by the UN -LRB- including the US -RRB- are humanitarian , to protect Libyan civilians , and that US policy -LRB- separate from the military action -RRB- wants Gadhafi gone , and the US has already done much -LRB- non-military -RRB- in that direction . \nMaybe if Speaker John Boehner watched CNN he would know more about what 's happening . \nSeriously though , the UN action in Libya is already late , IMO , and getting ` permission ' from Congress would have taken so long to have killed any hope the Libyan peasants had , not to mention their lives . \nIf members of Congress are simply complaining about being ` properly ' INFORMED , then they are disrespecting the president , and undermining his authority in front of the world doing so publicly . \nSome folks have no manners . \nIf they want to object to the US 's involvement with the UN resolution to take action in Libya , they should pipe down about communication etiquette , and go through the proper channels to object to helping the Libyan people . \nIt 's not just Obama that made these decisions . \nDid he break any rules ? \nIf not , they are just haters . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 6:00 pm | You have got to be kidding me . \nThe lead republicans were the first spoiling for this fight telling Obama he 's too slow to act . \nWell Obama set this intervention up through NATO correctly and by definition that process is slow but it is legal . \nThe mission stated by the President is clear as a bell unless you don t want to look or listen . \nNo boots on the ground protect the opposition currently under fire and suppress the Gaddafi forces with airstrikes , make a window for the NATO forces and hand off the progress to NATO command to continue watch until the snake stops moving . \nWe are trying to squeeze Gaddafi forces and sources until he can not move or breath . \nThe Libyan people that are called the opposition need to step up and remove him not us ... The Libyan people have to when this battle and they are the only ones that no friend from foe . \nClearly President Obama did not want this fight . \nThe only thing I need from Obama is the exit strategy not how long it s going to take to get Gaddafi . \nOh congress they can t even make a budget . \nRepublicans , Independents and Democrats are useless . \nAren t they supposed to be making JOBS !!!!!!!!! for the citizens of the United States ? \nAt least Obama is trying to stimulate trade in South America so our companies can sell more products to them and that means we can hire more people to make those products . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 6:01 pm | My understanding of America 's role is that we 're at war . \nA fighter jet , troops , or support sent , that is our own , which is sent across a border of another nation in order to aid and abet killing someone else , is why many people consider it war . \n`` Supporting '' killing , is just as bad as killing in my opinion . \nCherry picking when you want to call it `` support '' or when you call it `` a nation at war '' is ridiculous . \nLet 's make it perfectly clear , if an innocent child or women can accidentally be killed by something on the ground OR by something raining down on them from the sky . \nWe , in the civilized world , call this war no matter how you fluff it up . \nThis was an internal civil matter that should have been left to the Libyans in my opinion . \nIt 's not that I 'm unsympathetic . \nI say this only because there 's no clear guidelines being followed as we tromp around the middle east going from country to country . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 6:01 pm | As I understand it , our role is to support the no-fly zone mission by the U.N. . \nHowever , I think most people did n't expect the no-fly zone to mean dropping bombs left and right . \nMy issue is why do we get involved with a humanitarian mission to protect the people of Libya , but have not gotten militarily involved in Congo or Sudan where much more people were being killed ? \nI know this was n't our initiative , but a U.N. . \nBut is it safe to say the U.N. cares less about African nations ? \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 6:02 pm | The US bombs yet another country . . \nThe US needs to stay OUT of Libya March 21 , 2011 at 6:57 pm | CNN has reported that UN forces - that would include US aircraft - did the riads on Libya . \nWhy is this so har dto understand ? \nOr did CNN give us the wrong information ? \nFurther - why is anyone confused by this ? \nThe 24\\/7 news people of both parties have been reporting what will be done , by whom and how it should be done for over a week . \nMarch 21 , 2011 at 7:01 pm | Jack Cafferty sounds off hourly on the Situation Room on the stories crossing his radar . \nNow , you can check in with Jack online to see what he 's thinking and weigh in with your own comments online and on TV . \nWould you ride in a car that drives itself ? \nIs she the answer ? \nShould the #LoneStarState be allowed to withdraw from U.S. ? \n"}

Editor 's note : David Gergen is a senior political analyst for CNN and has been an adviser to four U.S. presidents . \nHe is a professor of public service and director of the Center for Public Leadership at the Harvard Kennedy School . \nCambridge , Massachusetts -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- After conversations with top players in Washington last week , mostly as I accompanied a group of Zuckerman Fellows from Harvard on a field trip , here are some brief reflections on the mood there toward events in the Middle East : The head-snapping change in policy toward Libya has everyone guessing where the Mideast is heading , whether the U.S. has a good handle , and most of all , what President Obama is trying to achieve . \nOne irony , as a female friend put it , is that for years many of us believed that if only more women could gain power , the world would surely become more peaceful . \nYet , we now see that the three people who talked Obama into using force against Libya 's Moammar Gadhafi were all women -- Hillary Clinton , Susan Rice and Samantha Power . \nLeading male advisers were opposed . \nPerhaps we should be less surprised than we are . \nAnd remember , too , that both were seen as successful leaders for most of their time in office . \nThere are divisions in Washington about the president 's actions , but most -- including me -- believe Hillary & Co. had the better argument . \nIf anything , the U.S. delayed too long , allowing Gadhafi to gain the upper hand on the ground . \nThe head-snapping change in policy toward Libya has everyone guessing ... what President Obama is trying to achieve . \nClinton 's voice key on Libyan policy Obama : No ground troops in Libya But what is the president 's endgame in Libya ? \nAnd what is his strategy for the Middle East more generally ? \nWho can say for sure ? \nOriginally , the president kept saying we want Gadhafi out -- but now that we are using force , he says we only want to stop him from killing more civilians . \nIs this mission creep in reverse ? \nAnd how tough would we be if , as seemed possible today , the Arab League begins to retreat from supporting force ? \nMeanwhile , the administration privately -- and rightly -- stresses that even as we hit Libya , we must keep a strategic focus on Egypt and Saudi Arabia , long seen as our most powerful Arab friends in the region . \nThe preliminary returns from weekend voting in Egypt -- we are still waiting to hear from Cairo -- will bring some heartburn in Washington . \nHow big a threat will the Muslim Brotherhood now become in elections a few months from now and what can Washington do about it ? \nEven bigger headaches are arising in the U.S.-Saudi relationship . \nSeveral top players from past administrations report that the Saudis are hugely angry about Obama 's treatment of Egypt 's ex-President Hosni Mubarak . \n`` He was your best friend in the region for more than 30 years , doing everything you asked , '' the Saudi argument goes , `` but a week after he got into trouble , you threw him under the bus rather than working out a graceful exit . \nHow can we now trust you ? '' \nThe Obama administration is now working to rebuild Saudi ties , but will it have sufficient leverage to help usher in more democratic reforms in the kingdom and , crucially at the moment , in nearby Bahrain and Yemen ? \nOr , as seems likely , will we be caught in increasing contradictions between our policy in Libya -LRB- crack down on an enemy government that kills demonstrators -RRB- vs. Bahrain and Yemen -LRB- go easy on a friendly government that kills demonstrators -RRB- ? \nThe big question mark is the president himself . \nRebounding from his electoral defeats last November , he seemed to be asserting a much firmer grasp on power , but in recent weeks , he appears to outsiders as someone who has slipped back into a haze of caution . \nThe Economist this week is even questioning his political courage . \nAs he sends U.S. troops into harm 's way , many in Washington are now waiting to see which Obama now emerges . \nMuch rides on the outcome . \nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Gergen . \n"}

Wesley Clark : No-fly zone is established , some military objectives achieved He says the more difficult questions are the diplomatic ones Clark asks : Will Libya be split by the civil war ? \nClark : Will Moammar Gadhafi be held to account for violence against civilians Editor 's note : CNN Contributor Wesley Clark , a senior fellow at the UCLA Burkle Center for International Relations , is a retired general and former Supreme Allied Commander in Europe . \nLittle Rock , Arkansas -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The coalition is concluding its second day of air operations . \nThe no-fly zone is established . \nA column of Libyan military vehicles , driving on a road toward Benghazi , has been attacked and destroyed . \nThis is what much of the world had been crying out for . \nYet the major questions have always been less about the military feasibility of the operation and more about its political goals ands how to achieve them . \nAlthough several world leaders have called for Col. Moammar Gadhafi to give up power in Libya , the authorizing U.N. Security Council resolution did not call for this . \nNo-fly zone a slippery slope to more ? \n-- Assuming the opposition forces are safe in Benghazi , then what must be done to protect civilians in those towns previously held by the opposition but have now been retaken by Gadhafi 's forces ? \nPresumably some U.N. presence must enter these areas and work to identify and protect civilians . \nThis will likely be resisted by Gadhafi and could spur further conflict . \n-- Will the U.N. and the coalition be satisfied with a political stalemate on the ground , in which the eastern portion of the country achieves de facto and de jure independence ? \nThe cease-fire called for in the resolution would seem to rule out any renewed offensive activity by the opposition . \nSo unless there is some means to apply additional leverage , there may be two Libyas : one a vengeful dictatorship , the other a fledgling democracy needing long-term international protection . \n-- Will Gadhafi be held legally accountable for the excessive violence already exercised against innocent civilians ? \nThis will require an investigation on the ground in Tripoli and other cities now under Gadhafi 's control . \nHe is not likely to accept this . \nMeanwhile , Gadhafi is doing his best to characterize the action as one of `` Crusaders attacking Muslims , '' and claiming excessive collateral damages , including civilian casualties , from the coalition 's initial air strikes . \nOne of the basic rules of intervention is to get it over with quickly . \nFrom the military standpoint , this has been done . \nBut how these initial military actions will relate to the stated -- and unstated -- goals of the operation remains the major challenge for the coalition . \nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Wesley Clark . \n"}

Bill Gortney said at a Pentagon press briefing . \n`` Regime forces are more pressed and less free to maneuver . '' \nAsked about reports of smoke rising from the area of Gadhafi 's palace , Gortney said , `` We are not targeting his residence . '' \nThe United States , detailing significant damage to Gadhafi 's air defenses and a military convoy , also fought a public relations campaign Sunday , insisting that two days of coalition bombing were n't going beyond mandates in the United Nations Security Council resolution . \nSecretary of Defense Robert Gates warned against widening the current allied operations to include a direct attack on Gadhafi , who earlier Sunday labeled the coalition `` terrorists . '' \nAnything that goes beyond enforcement of the no-fly zone and prevention of new military attacks on rebels risks disrupting the `` very diverse coalition '' that agreed to the attacks , said Gates , adding there was unanimous agreement in the top echelons of the Obama administration to push forward with military action in Libya . \nU.S. officials said they plan to hand over operational control of the military mission in coming days . \nThe coalition has nine other announced partners : Belgium , Britain , Canada , Denmark , France , Italy , Norway , Qatar and Spain . \nGates said the operation is off to `` a strong and successful start . '' \nHe made the comments while traveling to Russia , which said earlier Sunday that innocent civilians were being killed and urged more caution . \nThe Foreign Ministry in Moscow cited reports that `` nonmilitary '' targets were being bombed , including a cardiac center . \nA look at coalition 's military hardware Coalition air strike : The first hours `` We have no indication of any civilian casualties , '' Gortney said . \nA member of the Libyan opposition told CNN that the Gadhafi government collected bodies of people killed in fighting in the past week and displayed them over the weekend , trying to show they were killed by coalition airstrikes . \nThe claim by Ahmed Gebreel , who cited eyewitnesses and medical officials , could not be verified by CNN . \nThe Libyan military on Sunday called an immediate cease-fire after allied forces pounded one of its convoys near Benghazi and , according to U.S. officials , significantly degraded the regime 's air defenses . \nNational Security Adviser Tom Donilon scoffed at the report of the cease-fire , saying , `` It is n't true , or it was immediately violated . '' \nMeanwhile , President Barack Obama and his national security team worked behind the scenes to shore up support within the Arab world for the military mission in Libya , according to senior administration officials . \nThe senior officials described the Obama team 's phone calls as making clear to the Arab League that bombing Gadhafi 's air defenses falls within the Security Council resolution 's scope of imposing a no-fly zone and taking `` all necessary measures '' to stop the dictator from attacking civilians in his own country . \n`` We do n't believe this goes beyond the resolution , '' said one senior administration official . \nThe lobbying came after Arab League officials complained earlier Sunday that the bombing by the U.S. military and other allies inside Libya exceeded the scope of merely instituting a no-fly zone . \nArab League Secretary-General Amre Moussa told reporters before an emergency meeting Sunday that what is happening in Libya is different from what was intended by imposing a no-fly zone , according to Egypt 's state-run Ahram newspaper . \n`` What we want is the protection of civilians and not the shelling of more civilians , '' Moussa said , adding that `` military operations may not be needed in order to protect the civilians . '' \nBut Arab League chief of staff Hisham Youssef said Moussa 's comments did not signify a shift by the organization . \n`` The Arab League position has not changed . \nWe fully support the implementation of a no-fly zone , '' Youssef said . \n`` Our ultimate aim is to end the bloodshed and achieve the aspirations of the Libyan people . '' \nOn TV news shows in the United States , politicians debated the military campaign 's possible endgame . \n`` This is a very limited operation that is geared to save lives , and it was specifically targeted on a humanitarian basis , '' Senator John Kerry , D-Massachusetts , told NBC 's `` Meet the Press . '' \nSenator Lindsey Graham , R-South Carolina , and a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee , said on `` Fox News Sunday '' that this is the `` best chance to get rid of Gadhafi in my life . '' \n`` If we do n't get rid of him , we will pay a heavy price down the road , '' Graham said . \nU.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen told CNN that Gadhafi forces have shown little ability to counter coalition firepower . \nAllied aircraft struck a Misrata area airport that has both civilian and military uses , Gortney said . \nThree B-2 bombers struck only military positions at the airfield , he said . \nThere was violence across the country Sunday , with Gadhafi apparently shelling rebels in the west , while allied airstrikes destroyed one of Gadhafi 's convoys in the east . \nAs of Sunday night local time , the United States and British military had fired a total of 124 Tomahawk missiles at Libya 's air defense sites , Gortney said . \nGadhafi had said the strikes were a confrontation between the Libyan people and `` the new Nazis '' and promised `` a long-drawn war . '' \n`` You have proven to the world that you are not civilized , that you are terrorists -- animals attacking a safe nation that did nothing against you , '' Gadhafi had said in an earlier televised speech . \nAt the same time Gadhafi spoke , his regime was shelling Misrata using tanks , artillery and cannons , a witness said . \n`` They are destroying the city , '' said the witness , who is not being identified for safety reasons . \nHe said rebels were fighting back . \nSounds of heavy gunfire could be heard during a telephone conversation with the man . \nCNN 's Arwa Damon saw outside Benghazi the remains of a convoy of at least 70 military vehicles destroyed by multiple airstrikes Sunday , leaving at least five charred bodies , plus twisted tanks and smashed trucks as far as she could see . \nRebels with Damon told her it was a convoy of Libyan troops loyal to Gadhafi coming to attack Benghazi . \nResidents of the city , which was reported to be calm late Sunday , believe they can now take the offensive against loyalist troops . \nCNN 's Nic Robertson , Arwa Damon , Yousif Basil , Charley Keys , Chris Lawrence , Jill Dougherty , Elise Labott , Ed Henry , Larry Shaughnessy , Jim Bittermann , Paula Newton , Richard Roth , Maxim Tkachenko , Niki Cook and journalist Mohamed Fadel Fahmy contributed to this report \n"}

India calls upon all parties to abjure violence and the use of threat and force to resolve the differences . \nI think the need of the hour is cessation of armed conflict . \nMeanwhile , the African Union has called for an end to all military actions in Libya . \nMauritania President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz , whose country is hosting the union s summit right now , added that the African Union rejects the idea of foreign military intervention in Libya , regardless of its form . \nThe fact that we know so little about the domestic context among non-regime actors in Libya is precisely the reason that the types of external intervention currently taking place are likely to backfire . \nOn Libyan news site Jeel-Libya , Salem Ben Ammar writes approvingly of international intervention , calling this the beginning of the countdown to the end of the cowardly tyrant Gadhafi . \nAlso supporting the intervention is the London Evening Standard . \nIn an editorial , it writes : The air strikes against Libyan government targets have had one good outcome : the rebel stronghold of Benghazi did not fall , as it would otherwise have done , and the inevitable massacre of rebels did not take place . \nFrance Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said : The initial success of our intervention is clear . \nIf we had done nothing , Benghazi would be a bloodbath . \nWe saved the civilians of Benghazi . \nGreg Sheridan of The Australian writes : Even if this results in a prolonged stalemate it is much better than outright victory for Gaddafi . \nAnd in fact the precedents are not too bad . \nFor nearly a decade the U.S. and its allies enforced a no-fly zone against Saddam Hussein 's forces over the Kurdish areas of northern Iraq . \nThe de facto state that developed there was liberal and well run by Middle Eastern standards and has been central to the democratic dialogue in post-Saddam Iraq . \nIn the United States , Washington Post columnist David Ignatius compliments the Obama administration s handling of the intervention in Libya : President Obama is turning a page , by letting other nations take the first whacks at Moammar Gaddafi , no question about that . \nBut that strikes me as good strategy , not a feckless blunder . \nWhat s increasingly clear watching the play of events over the past week is that Obama really does want to change the narrative about America and the Arab world even at the cost of being criticized as vacillating and weak-willed . \nHe senses -LRB- rightly , in my view -RRB- that over the past several decades America , without really intending to , became a post-colonial power in the Middle East . \nThe narrative of American military intervention stretches from Lebanon to Iraq to Afghanistan , with the ghastly interlude of Sept. 11 , 2001 . \nObama seems determined to break with it . \nHe really is the un-Bush . \nIn Germany , foreign minister Guido Westerwelle said : It is the responsibility of every country to decide if they 'll support a military intervention or not . \nWe always said we would n't send soldiers . \nThis does not mean we are neutral , this does not mean that we have any sympathy with the dictator -LRB- Muammar -RRB- Qaddafi . \n-LRB- But -RRB- we calculated the risks , and when we see that three days after this intervention began , the Arab League has already criticised this intervention , I think we see we had good reasons . \nGermans reflect this ambivalence . \nA survey in the Bild am Sonntag newspaper found that 62 % of respondents supported international intervention , while 31 % were against it . \nDespite their support for international intervention , the majority of Germans did not want their country involved . \nGerman pundits worry that this stance will hurt Germany 's global standing . \nAmrit Naresh of The Local newspaper writes : Did we isolate ourselves ? \nIn a way , yes . \nDid we damage our room to maneuver ? \nWe have lost a little bit of credibility in the Security Council , I believe , with this cautiousness . \nAmr Moussa , secretary-general of the Arab League , stepped back from his earlier criticism of airstrikes and said the Arab League and the U.N.

March 24 , 2011 at 5:46 am | Reply Dr. Ali Hamdi , author of the healing bill book America has never abandoned any of its friends or allies ; to say nothing of an unarmed nation who has been mercilessly murdered by militia members and mercenaries from Cuba , Venezuela , Chad , Mali , Zimbabwe , and other parts of Africa . \nIt is therefore unfair to criticize the very nations that freed Kuwait , Afghanistan , Iraq , Kosovo , and Bosnia & Herzegovina for helping a tormented nation . \nI am very much aware that for the Chinese regime which like the Libyan one has massacred its own people in Tiananmen square and Tibet and the Russian government which killed thousands of innocent people in Chechnya and elsewhere deem the Libyan blood to be cheaper than a drop of oil and it is perhaps colorless . \nMarch 24 , 2011 at 9:23 am | Reply Dr. Ali Hamdi , author of the healing bill book The Security Council must regard corruption and its related offenses as intentional crimes and treat corruption , violation of human rights and the monopolization of authority and power the same way genocides , ethnic cleansing , and hostile activities against other nations are treated . \nWhen Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait , the Security Council issued many resolutions to deter him although the population of Kuwait was only three million . \nThe Security Council is therefore requested to issue similar resolutions and arrest the Arab dictators who violated human rights and enslaved not only three million but hundreds of millions of their fellow citizens . \nBecause of the stronghold that many Arab dictators have firmed up and the ineffectiveness of coups , the reform in countries of atrocity necessitates the intervention of the United States , the Security Council , Human Rights Organizations , the Civilized World and the International Community as a whole . \nThere are many grounds to support such intervention ; terrorism has begun in such countries as a result of the dictators violation of Human Rights and then spread like a cancer into the whole planet from such corrupt countries . \nOur dictators should solely be liable to the International Community for the pandemic-like diffusion of the ethical disease that destabilized the world and weakened the developed countries economy . \nIt is a horrible mistake to believe that Saddam Hussein was the only one who raised money for terrorist organizations or harbored terrorists ; most of the Arab dictators have been doing the same thing in three ways : while some of them supported the terrorists to shake the Israeli security , others have either harbored them with a view to destabilizing their neighbors or just to repel their chanceful hoax . \nOur dictators have been propagating hate ideas that threaten the convergence that is realized in respect of the dialogue of civilizations , not to mention their continuous violation of human rights and the inhuman practices a lot of people have unnecessarily undergone on part of such despotic dictators and their militias ; this situation pushed a lot of desperate people to join the terrorist groups in quest of getting rid of their lives . \nThe Security Council , which is supposed to reconcile between countries , must enact laws that enable the International Community 's interference in respect of the sought after reform in any country and issue resolutions with regard to dictators and officials who oppress their fellow citizens . \nOppressed citizens mustn t only be regarded as refugees and incarcerated like kettle in refugee camps , but must be treated with respect and great concern ; as for their claims , they must be given the same dimensions and level of concern that is usually given to cases filed against war criminals . \nArab dictators must be summoned to Amsterdam , New York , Geneva , or any foreign country and prosecuted and punished for the crimes they committed as in Saddam Hussein and Slobodan Milosevic 's cases . \nIf they are found guilty , they must be arrested , toppled , and punished . \nTheir victims must be well represented and allowed to talk the way we witnessed during Saddam s trial ; further more , such victims must be accommodated in five star hotels and enjoy the same services and respect their foes may enjoy all throughout the time of their trials . \nBecause a country is according to the United Nations Organization composed of its inhabitants and its land , sea and air , violating the inhabitants rights must impose the interference of the International Community and the Security Council whether the offender is a foreign country or from amongst the same country . \nJustice can not be fully established if partiality finds its way to the United Nations Judiciary System or the Security Council s offices . \nIt is the responsibility of superpowers like the USA , Great Britain , France , Germany , Australia , and other peace-loving countries to launch this initiative to clean the world from injustice and dictatorial regimes . \nBeing named The United Nations Organization and not The United Countries Organization clearly indicates that the nations are the most important factor in the said Organization as the name suggests . \nThe United Nations Secretary General and his staff know that a lot of people throughout the world have been going through injustice and deprivation on part of their dictators ; even though , no measures have been taken to diminish their sufferance , yet . \nEvery time a Secretary General is elected we rejoice and expect to see him issuing deterring resolutions , but apparently justice has not been amongst the United Nations ' concerns as far as the red carpets are laid to the Secretary General by such dictators . \nAre the leaders more important to the United Nations Organization than the millions of people the dictators have enslaved ? \nIf the answer is yes then the International Organization must change its name to read : the United Leaders Organization . \nSince the answer is no , this Organization must assume its full responsibilities and free the millions of oppressed people around the world and establish justice in their countries . \nThe inhabitants of this planet who are the basis of the foundation of the United Nations Organization rely on their Organization , the United States of America , the Civilized World and all countries that love peace and justice to topple the last dictators and free the world . \nWe can not wait anymore to see the world completely free of evil and injustice . \nThe United Nations is therefore requested to establish courts where ordinary citizens can complain against their leaders and sue them whenever they violate human rights , transgress or monopolize the dominion . \nThe United Stated of America has taken a vital part in preaching and spreading democracy in the world and has successfully changed the destiny of many nations ; however , many oppressed nations are still waiting to see the 101st Airborne Division , the 3rd Infantry Divisions , and other American brigades and battalions dumping the dictators in hell . \nThe dictators have always formulated trivial pretexts with a view to coating the violations of human rights in such entities with false sovereignty pretexts , and claimed that local affairs of their countries must be treated within their territories without foreign interference . \nSuch ostensible excuses mustn t be acceptable to the International Community anymore , because they have helped envelope the despotic leaders crimes with an illegal tricky legitimacy ; they are the same pretexts that helped a lot of Arab and African dictators kill millions of their fellow citizens . \nThe United Nations Organization is requested to enact laws that enable observers from the International Community to see and report how oppressed nations are living , because the horrible life conditions that a lot of people have been going through can not be detected by the foreign ambassadors who usually live in luxurious villas and maintain electric generators in their embassies and residences that start automatically as soon as the electric power is off to the extent that they do not even feel that the electric power was interrupted . \nThe authorities in many corrupt countries can interrupt the electric power and deprive major parts of any city from electricity for many hours without warning . \nThe intentional interruption of electric power can occur in the middle of a surgery , a lecture , or a long waited seminar , movie , or television series . \nIt happened that a surgeon lit few candles to finish an appendectomy for his client due to an intentional electric power interruption that was aimed to devastate the inhabitants of that particular quarter as a punishment for their continuous reform related demands . \nThe Security Council and all the developed countries are requested to alleviate the sufferance of oppressed people through effective means such as the enforcement of democracy in dictatorships and the legislation of laws that prohibit the dictators from their usual recourse to trivial pretexts that serve nobody except themselves . \nAn initiative of this kind will be a great idea that serves not only justice in the world but will without doubt reduce all the terror activities that have resulted from injustice . \nThe permanent members of the Security Council are invited to issue a resolution in this regard and propagate it all over the world to let everyone whether he is a leader or a subject know that he is not above the international laws and regulations . \nAs a matter of fact , there are many leaders and officials like Saddam and Slobodan Milosevic who need to be overthrown and prosecuted for recorded crimes against humanity ; the American , the Australian , and European immigration offices are rife with scary stories many immigrants have endured . \nThis resolution must clearly stipulate that presidential candidates must sign a Security Council sponsored written commitment to establish justice , fight injustice , surrender transgressors and terrorists irrespective of their ranks or positions , and undertake that nobody may be excluded from this obligation or enjoy any presidential , religious , tribal or diplomatic immunity when it comes to the violation of human rights and the failure to establish democracy ; such pledge must be signed before such presidents are allowed to start campaigning . \nThere must be a global commitment to not considering any body in any part of the world above the law . \nWhether the issue is about genocides or individual cases , the Security Council must treat such cases with the same level of concern , and if necessary forms committees of inquiry and a special army to bring to justice all outlaws who refuse to appear before their judges or fail to respond to such demands . \nPartiality , favoritism , and interests must be completely avoided where the concerned judges , investigators , and personnel should be absolutely independent and let work freely in any country and anywhere including palaces , mosques , churches , synagogues , and temples . \nThey mustn t be of any religious , political , geographical or ethnic predisposition . \nI believe that in presence of such global state of chaos and ethical degradation it will not surprise anyone of us to wake up in the morning and learn that a pro-Taliban group has regretfully toppled the Pakistani President in an overnight coup and seized the Pakistani nuclear arsenal . \nAlthough this scenario is furious in view of the brutality and hostility the group has been exhibiting , it is never farfetched . \nThat is why the implementation of democracy in the world is as vital as the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . \nEstablishing justice , implementing democracy , fighting terrorism , eradicating dictatorial regimes , fighting poverty and diseases , in addition to the non-proliferation of WMD must be the Civilized World Countries highest concern . \nIf the Security Council wishes to see the world better , its members must issue a resolution that stipulates that all corrupt and dictatorial regimes must be replaced by democracies where no leaders may govern for more than two terms of four years each . \nThe unconditional recognitions that the International Community has unfortunately granted to the kingdoms , sheikhdoms , sultanates , and dictatorships that resulted from chaotic states and gradually gained international recognition over time must be reviewed , canceled , and replaced with democratic republics . \nFor those who think they can prove me wrong , I remind them that except for the intervention of President Bush and his brave army , the Emirate that the Taliban Group had created on 90 % of the territories of Afghanistan would have gained full international recognition as a country and many of the criminals who enslaved the Afghani people and deliberately slain his men and shot his women dead , as we saw on TV , would have gained international recognition and walked on red carpets in many parts of the world by now . \nLikewise , the Arab kingdoms , sultanates , sheikhdoms , states , and republics have , in fact , gained international recognition when similar chaotic conditions in the past had left no room for the international community to calculate things the right way and depend on virtues in the way they recognized states and entities . \nIf the United Nations Organization is not able to correct such historical mistakes , the superpowers , in view of the damages they incurred as a result of the ethical mutation that was created by the dictators , must alternatively force the regimes that rule such entities to establish justice and implement democracy or give way to better regimes . \nMarch 24 , 2011 at 9:31 am | Reply Dear Editor . \nMy Country

FACT : Libya s current foreign minister , Musa Kusa , met with representatives of the British and American intelligence services in December 2003 to arrange deals to remove the sanctions being applied against Libya as the consequence of Ghaddafi s mass murder war crimes that included Ghaddafi s bombing of Pan Am 103 . \nWhat is corruptly ironic is that Kusa was educated at Michigan State University and both his children , born in the United States , are American citizens . \n...

March 26 , 2011 at 4:14 pm | Reply The United Nations , in my view , has entered a mature phase where it now seems prepared to act when any country extra-judicially decides to kill 1,000 or more of its citizens . \nThis is a giant leap forward for mankind and bravo to the U.S. , which acted with the complete support of Americans , the democratized world and the media , including Al Jazeera , save one questioning columnist . \nThat Republicans and a few others are now jittery about an uncertain mission is understandable but there was not one word of protest before the U.S. became involved . \nAs for red herring arguments that congress had to be consulted , I sincerely doubt it . \nIn Canada where the political parties are so divided they have forced an early election , just days before the Prime Minister 's motion in support of Canadian forces already deployed received unanimous support in the House of Commons , whereas American post-action partisanship is disingenuous and detracts from intelligent debate . \nOf course the developing situation is a valid concern as is cost . \nLuckily with these theftocracies as all dictatorships to date have turned out to be , there seems to be ample funding available that countries such as the U.

March 27 , 2011 at 1:07 pm | Reply Understanding the protests in Libya , Tunisia , and Egypt In light of the instability in Libya , recent decisions to enact a no-fly zone , and the heated debate that has ensued as a result of that decision , it seems the world has turned to reactionary measures , forgetting all too well that the instability seen in Libya , Egypt , and Tunisia can be easily repeated in other developing countries . \nMany have attributed the motivations of the protests across Middle East and North Africa -LRB- MENA -RRB- to economic hardship -LRB- exacerbated by the global recession -RRB- and government oppression , chalking up the viral nature of the protests to social media . \nThis view is shortsighted and ignores the drastic impact demographic changes , shaped over decades , can have on political and social stability . \nThe answer comes down to demographics : in the last 30 years , these countries have developed large educated youth populations . \nAs these populations came to age , these countries were primed for change . \nWhat Led Up to the Protests ? \nDemographers have at times been admired for their ability to tell the future . \nThirty years ago , a demographer could have told you the demographics of the Egypt , Libya , and Tunisia would be drastically different 2010 and as such , so would the political and social environments . \nLet s look at two factors that primed these countries for protests . \nIncreased Fertility Rates 30 Years Ago . \nIn the late 1970s and into the 1980s , Egypt , Libya , and Tunisia countries experienced increased fertility rates . \nFertility rates have since declined , but increased fertility rates 30 years ago have created today s reality : the majority of people in Egypt , Libya , and Tunisia are under the age of 35 , resulting in increased demands for resources and jobs . \nIncreased Access to Education . \nIn the 1980s , priorities and public spending turned to building human capital . \nIn the last 30 years , life expectancy in Egypt , Libya , and Tunisia has risen by about 3 years and infant and child mortality rates have declined -LRB- Egypt cut theirs in half -RRB- . \nA particular factor in priming North African countries for social change , however , was an increase in literacy and school enrollment rates , due to increased public priorities on education in the 1980s . \nCurrently , 99 % of Libyan youth between the ages of 15 and 24 are literate ; the numbers are similar in Tunisia and Egypt . \nTertiary -LRB- post-secondary -RRB- school enrollment rates in Libya , for example , are about 50 % . \nCompare that to 2.8 % in Kenya . \nWhat makes Egypt , Libya , and Tunisia -LRB- and many other MENA countries -RRB- unique from other developing countries ? \nIn short , a relatively healthy and educated youth population . \nWhy does this demographic make a difference ? \nYouth Are More Likely To Protest . \nNumerous studies have shown that marriage and increased age reduce the likelihood of protest participation . \nYouth who lack spousal and parental responsibilities are more likely to protest . \nAccess to higher learning opportunities increases information access and are often associated with increased expectation of government accountability , civil participation , and accessing formal employment opportunities . \nMany other African countries have large youth populations , but often access to secondary and tertiary school education for these populations is extremely limited . \nHigh Unemployment for Unemployment Leads to Instability . \nLooking at the specific case of Tunisia , 97.1 % of children attend primary school and 71 % of youth attend secondary schools - impressive numbers by many accounts . \nNow of those in the country who are unemployed , 41.7 % have a primary education , 37.7 % have a secondary education , and 13.6 % have a tertiary education -LRB- note that only 27.2 % of the population has a tertiary education -RRB- . \nThat means that more than half of the unemployed Tunisian population has accessed some kind of higher learning and while many of the unemployed in Africa can fall back on income-generating activities in agriculture , those in Egypt , Tunisia , and Libya are a bit more limited as non-agrarian industries dominate their economies . \nWhy is it Important to Understand the Impact of Demographics on Social Stability ? \nThe majority of African countries have large and growing youth populations , but higher education access has lagged behind . \nHowever , if education rates accelerated to match population growth , protests , as seen in MENA countries , could be mimicked all across Africa . \nDoes this mean that countries should stop investing in education to prevent instability ? \nEducated societies are critical to economic and social growth and well-being . \nThere is substantial evidence to support that East Asian investments in human capital and social programs , particularly education , were not only critical to economic growth , but also critical to social and political stability . \nSocial investments actually avoided political breakdown in several East Asian countries as governments responded , at least in part , population demands for public services . \nHowever , an educated population , particularly a youth population will demand change and accountability from governments . \nDeveloping countries , particularly African countries , can avoid substantial political and social breakdowns by identifying , including , and responding to the voices of their changing populations , particularly their growing youth demographics . \nMarch 27 , 2011 at 4:29 pm | Reply Wonderful work ! \nThat is the type of information that are supposed to be shared across the net . \nShame on Google for no longer positioning this submit upper ! \nCome on over and visit my web site . \nThank you = -RRB- September 24 , 2012 at 1:44 am | Reply -LRB- required , but will not be displayed -RRB- CNN welcomes a lively and courteous discussion as long as you follow the Rules of Conduct set forth in our Terms of Service . \nComments are not pre-screened before they post . \nYou agree that anything you post may be used , along with your name and profile picture , in accordance with our Privacy Policy and the license you have granted pursuant to our Terms of Service . \nEnter your email address to follow this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email . \nWhat #Pope Benedict leaves behind : Kathleen Sprows Cummings gives her take on GPS : bit . \nly\\/11C7KM4 Poor sanitation , water supply cause economic losses of about $ 260 billion annually in developing nations : World Bank bit . \nly\\/11Bw3d6 3:44 pm ET February 11 , 2013 RETWEET `` Since peaking in 2009 at 10.1 % of GDP , U.S. budget deficit has fallen . \nThis year , CBO says , it will be 5.3 % '' : Cassidy nyr . \nkr\\/12tXrci 12:35 pm ET February 11 , 2013 RETWEET What has #China banned TV advertisements for ?

'' \nFor weeks , Zlitan has been the target of an intense NATO bombing campaign . \nThe number of buildings and compounds devastated by air strikes have visibly increased since foreign journalists were taken on a government-controlled tour of the small city last month . \nThe Gadhafi regime accuses NATO of hitting food warehouses , health clinics and schools . \nBut a tour of one bomb site on Thursday revealed evidence suggesting the target was not entirely civilian . \nAt the compound of a bombed-out law school where classroom walls were scorched and broken glass littered the floor , CNN found several military uniforms lying on the ground next to wooden ammunition crates . \nWhen asked about the military paraphernalia , a government escort said the ammo boxes and uniforms `` belonged to school security guards . '' \nMeanwhile , every few seconds , rocket and cannon fire rumbled in the distance , as rebels and regime loyalists fought a deadly artillery duel across the front lines a few miles to the east of the city . \nZlitan is located less than 50 miles west of the rebel-held port city of Misrata , which survived a long , bloody siege by Gadhafi forces . \nOver the last week , rebel commanders claimed to have captured parts of Zlitan after advancing west from Misrata . \nBut on Thursday , the city center appeared to remain firmly in loyalist hands . \nThe combined NATO and rebel offensive have clearly taken their toll on Zlitan . \nOn Thursday , the city 's streets were mostly deserted and most of the shops were closed . \nResidents said they suffered from long power outages lasting 10 hours or longer . \nCivilian cars and an ambulance smeared with dirt -- a tactic used by both rebels and regime fighters to camouflage vehicles -- raced through the town center . \nThe rebel Transitional National Council and its allies in Washington , London , and Paris have long demanded that Gadhafi step down . \nBut more than five months after anti-Gadhafi protests first erupted across Libya , the flamboyant colonel is still clinging to power . \nHis government is threatening a war of attrition against his enemies . \n`` This war , this honorable confrontation , could go on for years , '' warned Gadhafi 's main spokesman , Musa Ibrahim , in a press conference on Wednesday . \n`` We do not want it to ... but from the beginning we were preparing ourselves to fight on the diplomatic front for years , on the military front for years , on the economic front for years . '' \nAs always in conflict , civilians pay the highest price . \nAt Thursday 's funeral , Abubakr Ali watched volunteers carefully bury the bodies of his sister and two nephews next to the neighborhood mosque . \n`` This was a civilian home . \nNo army , no military , no Gadhafi forces . \nIt 's a family sleeping safely in their place , '' he said . \n`` This is the protection of civilians , '' Ali added with disgust . \nHe was referring to the United Nations Security Council resolution which authorizes the use of force in Libya in order to protect civilian lives . \nAs tears streamed down his face , Ali took a Kalashnikov rifle and fired a round of bullets into the air . \n`` Screw NATO and the -LRB- rebel -RRB- rats and screw those who gave the coordinates for the attack , '' he yelled . \n`` God damn you now and in the afterlife . \nMoammar -LRB- Gadhafi -RRB- , I 'm with you until the last drop of blood .

'' \nWe follow Zambou 's car down the winding mountain road , closer to Tiji , our crew still marveling at the brutal yet spectacular terrain . \nThree rebel fighters sit beneath a flapping tarpaulin , peering down the deserted road to the besieged city . \nThere 's another rebel position two more kilometers down the road , Zambou tells us . \nA Grad rocket killed three of his fighters there recently . \nWe tell him we want to go to that final post , to interview the men there , but Zambou refuses . \n`` No , too dangerous - the road is very exposed on the way there , '' he said . \n`` Gadhafi troops will see you and probably fire with anti-aircraft guns , maybe rockets . \n`` I 'm not worried about you , '' he added . \n`` But the rockets could hit my men . \nDo n't go .

Ham 's testimony made clear that if they wanted to topple Gadhafi 's regime - a stated objective of the key players in the military campaign , Britain , France and the U.S. even if not necessarily through the military campaign - NATO powers , first and foremost the United States , would have to invest more military resources than they are currently doing . \nHam acknowledged that it would probably require the insertion of foreign ground forces to decisively turn the tide right now - the rebels have proven no match for Gadhafi 's forces , who have them largely pegged back in their eastern strongholds . \nHe said the U.S. would have to consider whether to send in troops . \nBut escalating Western direct involvement in Libya remains unlikely , at best , for a number of reasons : 1 . \nIt 's patently clear , by now , that Libya is in the throes of a civil war - even if the majority of Libyans detest Col. Gadhafi , it 's patently clear that a sizable minority is passionately committed to his regime and willing to fight for it . \nThe strength of the regime on the ground has been underestimated , and the power of the rebellion overestimated . \nThere 's no quick and easy military solution here . \nThe U.S. has until now made clear that it sees limited national interests at stake in Libya , envisaging its role as that of supporting a European-led intervention . \nBut the Europeans appear ill-equipped to escalate the air war , much less launch a ground war to topple Gadhafi . \nThe `` pottery barn rule '' still applies : If it took a Western ground invasion to topple Gadhafi , the Western powers would be forced to own the outcome , which could be extremely messy . \nThe dynamics among and between the various armed groups that would survive a regime collapse - from pro Gadhafi militias , tribal formations , and various factions of a rebel army that is anything but coherent - are barely understood , and there 's no real state left with institutions that could absorb and reconcile these groups . \nIt may have been recognized by Italy , France , Qatar and Kuwait as the sole legitimate government of Libya , but the Transitional National Council based in Benghazi does not even pretend to be a truly representative national body . \nKnocking out the regime now through the application of Western military force would create a vacuum that would very likely suck in foreign troops to maintain order and oversee the building of a new Libyan state from scratch . \nSure , President Obama would take some licks domestically if he fails to decisively topple Gadhafi , but he hardly wants to run for reelection having committed U.S. troops to a third nation-building mission in the Muslim world . \nUN Security Council Resolution 1973 , which provides the legal authority for foreign militaries to protect Libyan civilians , ca n't be translated into a regime-change operation without jeopardizing the alliance . \nKey NATO members such as Germany and Turkey oppose escalation , and Ankara is pressing hard for a cease-fire . \nStretching the permissions afforded by Resolution 1973 would also jeopardize future international cooperation on humanitarian interventions . \n-LRB- Russia and China may not have voted for this , but they enabled it by refraining from wielding their veto power at the Security Council ; if they believe NATO used the authorization as a pretext to pursue regime-change , they may not easily be persuaded to allow future humanitarian interventions . \nWhatever Arab support exists for the current operations is likely to rapidly erode if it involved sending in foreign troops - remember , even the rebels themselves loudly opposed that idea in the early days of the rebellion . \nWhat the West needs to do is meet it 's moral obligations and withdraw completely from Libya 's civil war and let the chips fall where they may even if that means a victory for Qaddafy 's forces . \nApril 8 , 2011 at 10:07 am | Reply We often talk about protecting civilian lives as if those who oppose kadhafi in Libya are the only lives that matter . \nI want to remind everyone that in any country just like here in USA , those opposing a government loudly is hardly the minority . \nScores of people do n't have an opinion , do n't care , or are benefiting from the system without political engagement -LRB- eg , Wall Street Bankers are not equal to tea party -RRB- . \nIt was irresponsible of those rebels to start a war , risking lives and ki , lling , , , yes ! \nkilling innocent people trapped between their ambitions and those of the government , without proper logistics . \nWar is not a game , and we of all people shouldn ' t give other countries and their citzens the impression that it is a game . \nIt may be for Haliburton and other war merchants and arms sellers , but it is a game that takes lives . \nThe war route should never be better than the ballot box . \ncutting handicaped , elderly and the help for those in need in our country to `` help '' rebels in other countries is stupid . \nPaying our debt and taking care of our own is n't . \nApril 10 , 2011 at 3:36 am | Reply America and Europ is giving ambitious politicians and adventurists around the world the idea that war takes you straight to power with the support of US and UN . \nTHat is a fake and deliberately destructive Idea . \nI am an opposition to the present government , but would never take up arms to defend my ideas or wishes . \nI would rather work to reform the system . \nIt 's hard work , even more so where democracy is not a regular thing . \nOppositions in new countries or non democratic countries what ever that is , are impatient . \nThey want to change things yesterday . \nThose who voted for Obama , Blacks who marched with Martin Luter King , ... Slaves , nerver saw the Justice and equal opportunity they wanted . \nThey are still not fighting America . \nWhy do we encourage such behavior in other countries ? \nRemember here we call those people terrorists . \nApril 10 , 2011 at 4:04 am | Reply The `` limited '' involvement is not working so time to cut and run . \nLet the other Muslim nations come in and protect civilians , rebels , whatever if they wish to . \nOtherwise let them kill each other and which ever dictator ends up in power just means we are back to where we were before it started . \nWhich was a Libya which was of no national or strategic importance to the U.S. April 8 , 2011 at 12:05 pm | Reply The Qaddafi forces are to be evicted from specified rebel areas `` by any means necessary '' according to President Obama . \nThat would include rebel tanks or other rebel armor . \nNATO should replace the equipment destroyed plus better communications gear , instantly if possible . \nAdditional air strikes against Qaddafi killers would help . \nQaddafi supporter areas can be encircled with no bombardment and\\/or killing of qaddafi civilian supporters . \nRebel forces must only jail captured Qaddafi fighters for trial . \nMake rebels UN\\/NATO peacekeepers . \nIn Qaddafi areas murdering civilians grows . \nApril 8 , 2011 at 12:19 pm | Reply Do you honestly believe what you just posted or are you trying to be funny ? \nNATO has no business nor any right for that matter , even to be in Libya ! \nApril 8 , 2011 at 2:34 pm | Reply Our Military is stretched thin , why ca n't NATO round up some Mercenaries to aid the rebels and help them fight , use some of Ghaddafi 's frozen assets to fund it ??

\nI think a thirst for freedom is probably in the hearts of the majority of Libyans just as is the case the Egyptians , etc. . \nI base my facts on the self-evident truth that all men and women of this world basically want to be free . \nApril 8 , 2011 at 6:36 pm | Reply Thank you , Eugene . \nYour comment is very enlightening since even I did n't know that but I still firmly believe that the `` rebels '' are aspiring to replace Mohammar Qaddafy some pro-Western stooge . \nApril 8 , 2011 at 7:52 pm | Reply What Nato need to do is create a no-mans-land between Benghazi and Tripoli for a period of say 5 years ... nothing can enter that no-mans-land during that period of time . \nAt the same time apply continued rigid sanctions against the Qaddafi regime and let the East freely trade and grow . \nInsist that the East creates a government and a new constitution and holds free and democratic elections . \nIf Eastern Libya complies , then the no-man 's zone is maintained until they ask for it to be removed . \na no-fly-zone would also be maintained over the west . \nThis would pretty much force Qaddafi 's hand . \nAnd no NATO ground troops would enter Libya . \nApril 8 , 2011 at 6:28 pm | Reply We do n't know the degree of repression that the Libyans are currently experiencing under Qaddafi so it is imposable to estimate the percentage of those Libyans under Qaddafi 's rule that would prefer to be free of him . \nApril 8 , 2011 at 6:45 pm | Reply I think we should let the opposition have some aircraft and helicopters with attack capability and replace the tanks and rocket launchers , that have been destroyed , since the conflict began , and replace them as they are lost due to hostile action . \nThis could include training , to use the equipment and communication equipment to talk to NATO aircraft to reduce friendly casualties . \nThey have trained helicopter pilots that could learn to fly a Huey Cobra in days in some cases , weeks in others . \nOlder model , A10 's flown by Libyan 's could be just what they people of Libya need to level the playing field . \nI 'm sure that these older , yet serviceable aircraft could be used to get effect against the Moammar Qaddafi military . \nMost of which are mercenaries and former criminals or committed criminal acts against the civilian population since Qaddafi took over in a coup 42 years ago . \nThe opposition deserves the chance to succeed and the world needs to assist them in their endeavor , freedom from tyranny does not come without loss of life . \nAmerica , fought for 4 years with the loss of thousands of lives both military and civilians , to win it 's freedom from England . \nApril 8 , 2011 at 11:01 pm | Reply hi , i would like to know how i can report an issue of an incident that occured januar 23,2007 . \nThe incident involves the US consulate to germany-Dusseldorff while the consulat was conducting an investigation , of which I was forced into the most scary situation . \nI 've tried to discuss the matter diplomatically with the US consulat to germany-Dusseldorff . \nThe investigation by the us consulate to germany-Dusseldorff serviceman Daniel -LRB- front desk duty officer -RRB- and myself were detained at Frankfurtmain and held until the nature of the investigation was explained . \nwe were detained because of an object , the content of a large metal box the officer tried to get out of Germany . \nI was unaware of the dangerous seizure . \nI have requested to disscuss the issue . \nRather , I have not heard an explanation . \nNo honest attempt to respond to my greivance . \nI was given a runaround . \nI was given numbers to call that never got me to speak to anyone that could answer any of mein questions . \nSo much red tape to get through . \nApril 9 , 2011 at 4:52 am | Reply -LRB- required , but will not be displayed -RRB- CNN welcomes a lively and courteous discussion as long as you follow the Rules of Conduct set forth in our Terms of Service . \nComments are not pre-screened before they post . \nYou agree that anything you post may be used , along with your name and profile picture , in accordance with our Privacy Policy and the license you have granted pursuant to our Terms of Service . \nEnter your email address to follow this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email . \nWhat #Pope Benedict leaves behind : Kathleen Sprows Cummings gives her take on GPS : bit . \nly\\/11C7KM4 Poor sanitation , water supply cause economic losses of about $ 260 billion annually in developing nations : World Bank bit . \nly\\/11Bw3d6 3:44 pm ET February 11 , 2013 RETWEET `` Since peaking in 2009 at 10.1 % of GDP , U.S. budget deficit has fallen . \nThis year , CBO says , it will be 5.3 % '' : Cassidy nyr . \nkr\\/12tXrci 12:35 pm ET February 11 , 2013 RETWEET What has #China banned TV advertisements for ?

{"id": "90", "time": "2011-07-10", "text": "Rebels say they ousted Gadhafi 's forces from Qawalish several days ago The small village is 90 miles south of Tripoli The fighters appear spirited , flashing victory signs and posing for photos Aided by NATO strikes , they are hoping to unseat the longtime Libyan leader Qawalish , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Almost all civilians have fled the western Libya area around Qawalish , hoping to avoid the worst of the violence wracking the nation . \nYet there is a buzz around this village , which is in the hands of rebel fighters eager to defeat forces loyal to longtime Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi . \nTheir optimism and energy are matched , in many ways , by their inexperience . \nWhen spotters on a rooftop spy vehicles they believe belong to the Libyan army , a rebel rocket team wipes off desert grit from their weapon , oils it up and fires -- their aim , at best , approximate . \nThe group 's commander , Fahti , knows the opposition forces are in many ways overmatched . \n`` They have tanks . \nRockets , '' Fahti said . \n`` They have mortars , all the heavy weapons . '' \nDressed in everything from military fatigues to polo shirts to T-shirts , the rebels are not the stereotypical picture of a modern fighting force . \nBut despite their challenges , the rebels here have had success . \nThat includes , they say , driving Libyan forces several days ago out of the village 45 kilometers -LRB- 90 miles -RRB- south of Tripoli , a key north-south route in the North African nation . \nOne fighter said Gadhafi 's men are `` very afraid '' that rebels will soon take another big step forward by taking his home city of Gharyan , which is 45 kilometers to the north and just 100 kilometers south of the Libyan capital . \nWhile strongest in the east near Benghazi , the opposition remains active around much of Libya . \nA fighter named Mahmoud told CNN on Saturday that his comrades had conducted night raids and ambushes , for instance , around his native Zamiya , a coastal city still in the government 's hands about 50 kilometers from Tripoli . \n`` But on the coast Gadhafi is strong , he has his people everywhere , '' Mahmoud said . \nThe opposition continues to get help in the form of NATO strikes . \nThe alliance announced in a statement Saturday that it had struck a missile-firing position near Tawhurgha , south of Misrata , that it claims was tucked within a set of farm buildings . \nLibyan forces used this area to attack civilians in nearby Misrata through missile strikes and as a staging area for attacks , NATO said . \nIn Qawalish , the rebels had some good fortune after coming upon an abandoned army base , and its boxes stacked almost to the ceiling with mortar and artillery rounds . \nThe find was a welcome one for a force that , until recently , was struggling to muster the weaponry to keep up the fight . \nThose rolling through checkpoints around the village are almost exclusively rebel fighters , drawn to the battlefront by their commitment to a common cause . \nTheir enthusiasm appears strong as they drive by , crammed into the back of pickup trucks , smiling broadly and flashing victory signs . \nAnd even with the sounds of war in the distance , some rebels pose for pictures -- victory photos , they hope , in their quest to end Gadhafi 's 42 years in power . \n"}
{"id": "120", "time": "2011-03-20", "text": "Republican senator says military mission should oust Gadhafi U.S. to hand over leadership of mission in coming days Coalition forces took out most of Libya 's air defense systems , Mullen says Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A U.S.-led military mission in Libya has effectively imposed a no-fly zone and blasted some of Moammar Gadhafi 's ground forces outside the rebel stronghold of Benghazi , Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen said Sunday . \nThe coalition forces , including U.S. , British and French aircraft , have taken out most of Libya 's air defense systems and some airfields , Mullen said in interviews on CNN 's `` State of the Union '' program and other networks . \nIn addition , Libyan ground forces in the vicinity of Benghazi were hit in an effort to prevent attacks on lesser-armed rebel fighters and civilians , said Mullen , who called the start of the mission a success . \n`` I would say the no-fly zone is effectively in place , '' Mullen told CNN , adding that the strategy now is to cut off logistical support for Gadhafi 's forces that are `` pretty spread out '' from Tripoli to Benghazi . \nMullen also said Gadhafi 's forces had shown little ability to take on the coalition firepower so far , and he made clear that the scope of the mission was limited , involving creation of the no-fly zone , stopping attacks on civilians and allowing humanitarian operations to proceed . \nHe acknowledged on NBC 's `` Meet the Press '' that the military mission could be completed with Gadhafi still in power . \nFighter jets hit Libyan army convoy Action taken to stop Gadhafi Obama : No ground troops in Libya `` He 's a thug , he 's a cagey guy , he 's a survivor . \nWe know that , '' Mullen said of Gadhafi on the CBS program `` Face the Nation , '' noting that the Libyan leader has access to large quantities of mustard gas that concern the United States . \n`` It 's something he could do a lot of damage with , '' Mullen said , adding that coalition forces were closely monitoring the situation and , so far , `` have n't seen him move in that direction . '' \nU.S. President Barack Obama had been under mounting pressure from Republican critics and some Democrats to take steps against Gadhafi . \nOn Sunday 's talk shows , all U.S. politicians interviewed welcomed the new military mission , but some worried it was too late or too limited to do the necessary job of taking out Gadhafi . \n`` Isolate , strangle and replace this man -- that should be our goal , '' Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina told `` FOX News Sunday . '' \nIn particular , Graham took issue with Obama 's insistence on getting a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing the mission as well as Arab League endorsement as a strategy to prevent accusations of a U.S. vendetta against the Islamic world . \n`` I think the president ` caveated ' this way too much , it 's almost like it 's a nuisance , '' Graham said . \n`` This is a great opportunity to replace a tyrannical dictator who is not a legitimate leader , who is an international crook . \nAnd we should seize the moment and talk about replacing him , not talking about how limited we will be . '' \nHowever , Mullen and Democrats said gaining international consensus for the mission was crucial , and Mullen made clear that the U.S. role would be limited , telling NBC that `` we 're not going to put any boots on the ground . \nThis is n't about occupation in any shape or form . '' \nDemocratic Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island told reporters that the best outcome `` would be for Gadhafi and his family to recognize that they are illegitimate rulers of the country and to depart the scene , allowing the United Nations , politically , to organize a popular referendum or some democratic means to establish a new government . '' \n`` If Gadhafi chooses not to go , then , I think , there will be a longer period of conflict , '' Reed said . \n`` But I just sense that given this incredible unified opposition to him , particularly the Arab League , that the signal has to be clear that his days are numbered . '' \nFor now , Mullen told CNN , `` we would like to see him withdraw his forces across the country back into garrison '' and stop attacking his people . \nWhen told that Gadhafi was claiming women and children had been killed in the coalition air strikes , Mullen said on CNN that the targets were selected carefully , adding : `` I 've seen no reports of significant civilian casualties . '' \nOn other networks , he said he was unaware of any civilian casualties so far . \nAs part of the no-fly zone , coalition combat aircraft will be patrolling over Benghazi at all times , Mullen told CNN . \nCoalition forces also are looking to jam communications of Gadhafi 's forces in what Mullen called the `` first phase of a multifaceted '' operation . \n`` While we 're leading it now , we 're looking to hand off that leadership in the next few days , '' Mullen said on NBC . \nOn the same show , Democratic Senator Carl Levin of Michigan , the chairman of the Armed Services Committee , said Britain , France and Arab nations would assume control of the mission . \nMullen said he expected Arab countries that supported the mission to begin contributing military help . \nOn Sunday , the French Defense Ministry announced that Qatar has offered to contribute four fighter planes to the coalition effort . \nHouse Speaker John Boehner , R-Ohio , issued a statement Sunday calling for Obama to provide more explanation on the military mission . \n`` Before any further military commitments are made , the administration must do a better job of communicating to the American people and to Congress about our mission in Libya and how it will be achieved , '' Boehner 's statement said . \nTo Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona , Obama waited too long to take action in Libya . \n`` We need now to support him and the efforts that our military are going to make , '' McCain told CNN in an interview taped Friday and broadcast Sunday . \n`` And I regret that it did n't -- we did n't act much more quickly , and we could have . '' \nMcCain , the ranking GOP member of the Senate Armed Services Committee , said if the United States had acted a few weeks ago , a no-fly zone `` would probably have been enough '' to prevent the situation in the African country from deteriorating . \nEven so , he said , time is now against Gadhafi . \n`` If he -LRB- Gadhafi -RRB- does n't succeed in a relatively short period of time , he 'll be driven back and , over time , I believe , defeated , '' McCain said . \n`` I have great confidence in our capabilities that the most mightiest nation in the world is now matched up against a third-rate or fourth-rate power . '' \nAsked if the United States waited too long , Mullen answered that it was impossible to say what might have changed if there had been earlier U.S. action . \nHe emphasized the importance of gaining international consensus and assistance for the military mission launched almost exactly on the eighth anniversary of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 , saying : `` This was n't something the United States ginned up .

'' \nHe 's harshly criticized the other countries getting involved with the civil war in Libya . \nHe called the coalition forces `` terrorists '' and promised a `` long-drawn war .

'' \nAs Britain and France pushed for a quick U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing a no-fly zone , officials said Clinton teamed up with Susan Rice , U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , in creating the conditions for a resolution with the broadest possible authority and the largest international support . \nClinton made the case that U.S. support for a no-fly zone was conditioned on Arab participation and leadership . \nIn Paris , Clinton met with her counterparts in town for a meeting of the Group of 8 foreign ministers and with Abdullah bin Zayed , the foreign minister of the United Arab Emirates . \nEven as she criticized the UAE for its recent decision to send forces to quell a rebellion in Bahrain , Clinton pressed him to send planes to Libya . \nAs Clinton traveled to Cairo and Tunisia seeking Arab buy-in for the resolution , officials said Rice built support in New York for the resolution . \nSamantha Power , an adviser to Obama on the National Security Council and a human rights activist , was also urging the president to intervene . \nClinton 's alliance with Rice and Power in pushing for intervention put her at odds with Defense Secretary Robert Gates , who had publicly argued against a no-fly zone . \nSources said Vice President Joe Biden was also more cautious , arguing for the smallest possible U.S. involvement in any military action . \nA senior administration official said that `` like the president , the vice president wanted any action taken with a broad international coalition . '' \nThe official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive military planning , said when the vice president `` saw that was achievable , he supported the policy to seek the military intervention . '' \nAfter meeting with Amr Moussa , secretary general of the Arab League , in Cairo Tuesday night , officials said Clinton called Obama , telling him the Arabs were willing to take part in the no-fly zone . \nThat participation , officials said , was critical for the administration , which was concerned about the perception of invading a third Arab country . \n`` In order for us to go along , it was important for the Arabs to have some skin in the game , '' one senior official said . \nCNN Senior White House Correspondent Ed Henry contributed to this report . \n"}
{"id": "171", "time": "2011-03-20", "text": "2 men charged in death of Chicago teen who performed in inauguration event . \nIt was a stark , raw tweet from Ben Wedeman with a big impact on our newsroom Saturday morning . \nOne of our first and most-trusted sources of information on the conflict in Libya had become a victim of the very civil war he in some ways had helped to spark . \nIn the first few days of the conflict back in February , `` Mo '' as we called him had become an inspiration , friend and `` go-to '' source as well as a regular witness on CNN 's shows . \nOf course , you would n't know that from watching . \nWe blurred his face and gave him code-names like `` Benghazi Protester '' in order to protect him and his young family . \nIt was a struggle to keep him from blurting out his name and even phone number on air , sometimes , as Mohammed said that he wanted freedom for Libya , or to be martyred trying to achieve it . \n`` I am not afraid to die , I am afraid to lose the battle , '' the young , western-educated software engineer would tell us when we asked him to keep his identity secret . \nLibya before the fighting started was one of those very few `` black holes '' on the world 's map for us : like North Korea or Syria , it was a country where the regimes iron grip on information was so strong and the secret police so brutal and pervasive that the risk of contacting people was simply not justified for putting peoples lives at risk by staying in regular communication . \nWhen that all began to crumble beginning on February 17th and Libyans in the country 's east began to rise up , we had to develop webs of witnesses from scrap . \nBut one quickly became our most savvy source : a 27-year-old technology expert and former internet provider in Benghazi . \nMohammed and other supporters had set up a kind of protest command center in the city 's courthouse after ejecting Ghadhafi 's forces in the first days of fighting . \nThat 's where we first contacted him on February 18th - a guy who looked more Silicon Valley in a hooded sweatshirt and big headphones than a partisan in a Libyan war zone . \nAmazingly , Mohammed had beaten the regimes firewalls and jerry-rigged a live signal from the building . \nThe camera showed the few hundred protesters huddled outside against the walls due to the cold and whipping winds - worried that Gadhafi 's forces could swoop in at any moment . \nIt was our first view of the protests there , and we were worried that all this would be traced back and used to target the band of students and young people defying the Gadhafi regime . \nAt first Mo just wanted to get that picture to us , as he felt that it provided a thin blanket of security . \nHe thought Ghadhafi might hold back if he knew that ordering the army or his feared African mercenaries to slaughter the protesters would be seen on live television around the globe . \nMohammed pushed the technical know-how limits of our engineers and desk editors such as Yousuf Basil , Jack Maddox , Ben Brumfield and myself as he came up with elaborate ways to get more and more cameras going around the courthouse . \nBut it was n't until we started interviewing him on air that we realized how special he was . \nMohammed poignantly told us about how the army had shot into the crowds , then using armored vehicles to roll over protesters after they had run out of ammunition , and how the demonstrators would not give up . \nAfter the first two days he told us with his live stream and webcasts he had become some sort of leader . \n`` People have been calling my mobile non-stop . \nI woke up today with 125 missed calls . \nPeople have been calling and checking on me to see if I am safe . \nOne person called from Serbia just to say they are thinking of me and my struggle . '' \nChillingly , the newly married man with his first baby just a month from being born told us he believed the government knew who he was and there would be a price to be paid for his boldness . \n`` I would love to wake up tomorrow and people not be dead . \nBut I know 200 people will be dead , '' he told one of our desk editors , Mitra Mobasherat . \n`` Libyans lives to Gaddafi are very cheap . '' \nOur correspondents in the field eventually caught up with Mohammed as CNN teams like Ben Wedeman and Mary Rogers led the push to get into the rebel territory , with Arwa Damon featuring him in one gripping package . \nLater , as the rebel lines advanced toward Tripoli , we were in contact with him less often , but he expanded his presence and contact with the rest of the world . \nAlong with his supporters he developed social media sites like Feb17 . \ninfo , set up an independent internet TV signal `` Libya al-Hurrah '' and conducted interviews with dozens of broadcasters . \nAnd as the conflict surged back toward Benghazi in recent days he began to go out into the field to interview people about the dangers and loss they were suffering from the ongoing struggle . \nThat 's what he was doing Friday when he was fatally shot . \nReports are still sketchy , but his wife and supporters say he was killed by a headshot from a sniper while going out to videotape rocket attacks on one neighborhood where he heard several children had been killed . \nHe phoned in one last report that morning to al-Hurrah , with the sounds of heavy machine gun fire rattling and artillery exploding around him . \nThen , nothing else until Ben 's tweet , and the following announcement he had been killed after the fighting . \ninfo was one final favorite quote of Mohammed Nabbous : `` A Candle loses nothing by lighting another Candle . '' \nThere 's already so much hate spewed on these blogs . \nNobody needs to see any more from the so-called `` friendly '' bloggers . \nMy stuff to other bloggers is all meant to be taken in the spirit of friendship and fun . \n@ Banasy , That comment u made was n't in the spirit of `` friendship '' . \nI know who u are even though u have fooled some , I know how u operate , I should because I work with crazy B 's all day . \nI have no need to converse with u from this point on , dont have any need to make life out side of work stressful either . \nBut just to say your true colors will show evenually and ppl will see who u really are . \nHave a good life . \nfrom the more level headed one my `` friend '' March 22 , 2011 at 12:01 pm | Report abuse | @ Banasy , U could have responded on the blog that this took place , I can only assume it is for Cesar r 's benefit , little girl Girls please . \nNo man is worth bickering over . \nAll men are pigs , or have you forgotten . \nThanks Lisa , but i 'm really not bickering over him in the true sense , just cant take the crazy women anymore . \nI may have to work with them for awhile longer but I wont deal with any outside of work . \nOnly time tells if a man is worth it . \nDo you FB March 22 , 2011 at 1:14 pm | Report abuse | Mary , I do n't know what I did to make you so angry , and it does n't really matter now that you 've called me some choice names I really do n't deserve . \nMohammad , may your soul rest in pI found blogs from Mohammad . \nAmerica , Libya is NOT on the verge of civil war . \nMohammad -LRB- madmanmoe -RRB- said that , `` Libya wants everyone united and if anything , this conflict has brought us much closer together than ever before .

Security Council resolution , '' Gates told reporters Sunday while on a plane to Russia . \n`` If we start adding additional objectives , then I think we create a problem in that respect . \nI also think that it is unwise to set as specific goals , things that you may or may not be able to achieve .

{"id": "78", "time": "2011-03-18", "text": "Libyan Foreign Minister Moussa Koussa announces cease-fire campaign against rebels Follows earlier vote by U.N. Security Council to impose no-fly zone in Libya Member states authorized `` to take all necessary measures '' to protect civilians U.S. , France , Britain lead countries offering to contribute military assets -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Libya 's embattled regime declared a cease-fire Friday as an international coalition was preparing to enforce a United Nations-backed no-fly zone to protect civilians in the war-torn country . \nThe U.N. Security Council vote followed recent successes by heavily-armed government forces loyal to leader Moammar Gadhafi against the largely untrained and under-equipped rebels . \nPro-government forces were thought to be on the brink of an assault on Benghazi -- a city of one million people seized by the opposition during the uprising -- and had reportedly launched air attacks . \nDespite the announcement of a cease-fire , there were reports of fighting Friday in western and eastern Libya . \nActing under Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter , which provides for the use of force if needed , the Council adopted Resolution 1973 by 10 votes to zero , with five abstentions , authorizing member states `` to take all necessary measures '' to protect civilians and civilian populated areas under threat of attack ... while excluding an occupation force . '' \nLibya reacts to no-fly zone U.N. okays no-fly zone over Libya The resolution follows an arms embargo that the Council imposed last month when it unanimously approved sanctions against Libya , freezing the assets of its leaders and referring the ongoing violence against civilian demonstrators to the International Criminal Court -LRB- ICC -RRB- . \nWhat does the resolution mean ? \nAn U.N.-backed international force will enforce a no-fly zone over Libya which will effectively ground Libya 's military aircraft . \nAll flights -- except those for humanitarian purposes -- will be banned from Libyan airspace . \nThis force will also have the power to launch air strikes against Libyan ground forces -- from tanks , artillery and missiles to their communications and command and control infrastructure -- if they are considered to be a threat against the civilian population . \nAccording to Barak Seener , Research Fellow in Middle Eastern Studies at the Royal United Services Institute -LRB- RUSI -RRB- in London , the wording in the resolution permitting member states to use `` all necessary means '' also makes pre-emptive strikes from the air at the regime 's forces legitimate . \n`` It 's intended to force Gadhafi back and tilt the balance in the rebel 's favor , '' he told CNN . \n`` I think it will embolden protesters across the Arab world as it is a precedent to oppressive regimes . \nThe resolution is saying human rights violations will not go unabated and there will be a response . '' \nWho backed the Security Council vote ? \nTen of the 15 council members , led by the U.S. and Britain and France , voted in favor of the no-fly zone . \nWho voted for no-fly zone ? \n`` Any decision to put the men and women of our armed services into harms ' way should only ever be taken when it 's absolutely necessary , '' British Prime Minister David Cameron said in a statement to the country 's parliament after the vote . \n`` But we simply can not stand back and let a dictator whose people have rejected him , kill his people indiscriminately . '' \nChina , Russia , Germany , India and Brazil abstained from the Security Council vote citing concerns about a protracted conflict in Libya . \n`` We oppose the use of armed force in international relations and we have serious reservations about some of the content of the resolution , '' said Jiang Yu , a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs . \n`` We support the U.N. Secretary-General 's Special Envoy to Libya , African Union and Arab League to resolve this crisis peacefully , '' she said . \n`` We hope that the situation in Libya will return to stability as soon as possible to avoid more serious escalation of armed conflict and humanitarian crisis . '' \nWho will police the no-fly zone ? \nThe U.S. and NATO partners have contingencies in place to act within hours , according to an administration official familiar with planning . \nPresident Barack Obama will insist on a major Arab role in any no-fly zone , the official said . \nCameron said Britain had started preparations to deploy aircraft , and `` in the coming hours '' they will move to air bases where they will be positioned for any `` necessary action . '' \nFrench government spokesman Francois Baroin said France plans to participate in what he described as `` swift '' efforts . \nMeanwhile all 39 member states of European Air Traffic organization Eurocontrol , which includes the European Union 's 27 nations as well as Russia , asked the agency to `` ban all flights '' flying over and heading to Libya , a spokeswoman said , in quotes carried by Agence France-Presse . \nWe simply can not stand back and let a dictator whose people have rejected him , kill his people indiscriminately . \nWill other Arab countries be involved ? \nThe Arab League 's U.N. ambassador , Yahya Mahmassani , said two Arab countries would take part in a no-fly zone operation , but he was not sure which two . \nThe Arab League last week called for a no-fly zone following reports of Libyan air attacks on urban areas . \n`` Their involvement will be largely symbolic but extremely important , '' said Seener . \n`` We 're probably looking at involvement from Qatar , UAE and perhaps Saudi Arabia and Egypt . \n`` Autocrats and Islamists can not create a false narrative of western colonialism . \nRather Gadhafi is deeply unpopular in the Arab world , and the West is fostering a human rights narrative for opposition movements around the Arab world to advance more forcefully . \nIt is also ensuring that the trajectory of opposition will go down a human rights path rather than one of resistance in the form of Islamism or radical nationalism . \n`` This also serves as a declaration to authoritarian regimes throughout the region that the West is not an ineffectual foe or paper tiger and will not overlook human rights abuses for the sake of relative short-termed stability . '' \nIs Gadhafi bluffing with the cease-fire ? \nLibyan Foreign Minister Moussa Koussa , speaking to reporters Friday in Tripoli , said that in light of its membership in the United Nations , the country is `` obliged to accept the Security Council resolution that permits the use of force to protect the civilian population . '' \nKoussa says Libya was disappointed with the imposition of a no-fly zone , arguing that it will hurt the civilian population . \nHe also said the use of military power violates the country 's sovereignty and goes against the U.N. charter , but he acknowledged that some countries may yet intervene . \nHowever Seener said this was simply a survival tactic by the Gadhafi regime . \n`` It is a tactic to blunt the western response . \nThere is no way the regime is willing , in a constructive manner , to engage with the opposition and share power . \n`` They are simply geared towards maximizing their own power and coercing their own people . \nIt would be folly to leave the rebels in a vulnerable position . '' \nWho will foot the bill for the fly-zone ? \nParticipating countries will have to pay their own costs , said Seener . \nHowever he added that the U.S. would be doing most of the `` heavy lifting '' in terms its military contribution . \nBut with the U.S. and its NATO allies such as Britain heavily involved in Afghanistan , Seener said the issue of military intervention in Libya had been heavily politicized in some countries . \n`` Some sections of press in the UK have said British forces are already over-committed and defense spending needs to be increased , while others say we ca n't engage in Libya because we 're stretched and need to focus on Afghanistan . '' \nHe said the reality is Britain does have the capacity to commit to the campaign in Libya without compromising its role in Afghanistan . \n"}

March 18 , 2011 at 12:01 pm | Report abuse | Reply I was incredibly upset over the interview with Mr. Netanyahu . \nMr. Morgan interrupted him so many times , rarely gave him a chance to finish his answers , did not hear a word the Primie Minister said and implied that it is up to Israel to give in to all of the demands made by the world . \nWhat a horrible interviewer . \nNo wonder I never listen to CNN . \nYou are spot on . \nIt was the first time i saw Mr. Morgan give an interview and it was very dissapointing . \nMr. Morgan should have handed Mr Netanyahu the questions so Mr. Morgan could have touted even more of his views . \nIt was borderline disrespectful . \nI believe the moon is this close and full every 2 or 3 years not 20 . \nIt 's the blue moon that occurs every two-three years . \nThe full , close moon that 's coming up is the perigee moon . \nAnd as for Lybia , put a smart bomb in his hooka or pipe . \nI mean Gadafi 's !! The dude is smoke'in some good sh-t . . \nThe moon is coming right for us ! \n\\* jumps out window \\* I 'm trying to watch the reporting coming in from Tripoli , but the CNN newscasters wo n't keep their pie-holes shut long enough so that the viewer 's can hear and the see anything including the reporters on the ground . \nThe state-side staffers need to `` SHUT THEIR MOUTHS '' so we can watch the action !!! 3\\/19\\/11 . \nLibya -- not pleasant to watch , but why does America , UK & the rest feel they need to get involved . \nTHREE LETTERS -- OIL . \nHistory repeats itself again . \nBig brother will send their young men & woman to slaughter again . \nUK sold arms weeks before , earlier media reports said they had no money for social necessities , but quickly found money for bombs . \nHow do you sell you people this nonsense ? \nAmerica relies again on their terrible intelligence from Bengaz your own CIA as per media reports ? . \nNow you wonder why the Arab world distrusts you people . \nI am Christian South African , and I wonder seriously what your real intention could be . \nObama -- you are no better than your predecessor . \nAs for the Lybian gov-military I say they ca n't be trusted , no more than you can trust the word of our gov.

'' \nWhile Gadhafi did not mention the other three missing journalists , the Times said Libyan government officials told the U.S. State Department on Thursday evening that all four would be released . \nThe paper also said the Libyan government allowed the journalists to call their families Thursday evening . \n`` We 're all , families and friends , overjoyed to know they are safe , '' the paper quoted its executive editor , Bill Keller , as saying . \n`` We are eager to have them free and back home .

'' \n`` We 've been told by the government that she 's with her family , but when we asked , ` Could we go and see them ? ' \nthe government official said that would be up to the family , '' Robertson said , adding that journalists have indeed been in touch with the family , who have said they would grant permission to see al-Obeidy . \nHowever , international journalists , including CNN 's staff , are not allowed to move freely in the Libyan capital and are escorted out of the hotel only on organized outings by government minders . \nSaturday 's incident was the first time a Libyan opposed to Gadhafi attempted to independently approach the journalists in Tripoli . \nRobertson also tried to ask Ibrahim about statements the spokesman made referring to al-Obeidy as a prostitute , but he declined to answer the question while saying , `` I 'm not withdrawing from what I said . '' \n`` We need to protect her privacy , her daughter 's rights when she grows up , '' Ibrahim said . \n`` We need to make this as criminal case , as legal a case as possible without talking about people 's history , their files , their previous crimes or their lifestyle . '' \nWedad Omar , the woman 's cousin , told CNN that the 30-year-old al-Obeidy is single and does not have a daughter . \nAl-Obeidy burst into the hotel Saturday as international journalists were having breakfast . \nHer face was bruised , as were her legs . \nShe showed the journalists blood on her right inner thigh . \nSpeaking in English , she said she was from the rebel stronghold of Benghazi and had been held against her will for two days and raped by 15 men . \n`` Look at what Gadhafi 's brigades did to me , '' she said . \n`` My honor was violated by them . '' \nShe displayed what appeared to be visible rope burns on her wrists and ankles . \nCNN could not independently verify al-Obeidy 's story , but her injuries appeared consistent with what she said . \nGovernment officials moved to stifle her , but she persisted . \nSecurity forces moved to subdue her , and even a member of the hotel 's kitchen staff drew a knife . \nhe shouted at her . \nAnother staffer attempted to throw a dark tablecloth over her head . \nOne government official , who was there to facilitate access for journalists , pulled a pistol from his belt . \nOthers scuffled with the journalists and wrestled them to the ground in an attempt to take away their equipment . \nSome journalists were beaten and kicked . \nCNN 's camera was confiscated and deliberately smashed beyond repair . \nSecurity men said al-Obeidy was `` mentally ill '' and was being taken to a `` hospital '' as they dragged her to a waiting white car . \nShe insisted she was being taken to jail , saying , `` If you do n't see me tomorrow , then that 's it .

'' \nDonilon 's announcement came as officials in Washington , Europe and the Middle East are debating whether to aid rebel forces , who have been battling to topple Gadhafi since mid-February . \nBut in a blunt assessment to Congress , National Intelligence Director James Clapper said Gadhafi 's advantage in military force makes him likely to survive the revolt . \nAre Libyan rebels losing momentum ? \nClinton : Libya will be held accountable NATO awaits U.N. mandate on Libya McCain talks possible Libyan no-fly zone Clapper told the Senate Armed Services Committee that the rebels are `` in for a tough row '' against Gadhafi , who still commands warplanes , an air-defense network and loyal army brigades against the opposition forces . \nHe cautioned that the situation is `` very fluid , '' but added , `` I think , longer term , the regime will prevail . '' \n`` I do believe Gadhafi is in this for the long haul , '' Clapper said . \n`` I do n't think he has any intention , despite some of the press speculation to the contrary , of leaving . \nFrom all evidence that we have -- which I 'd be prepared to discuss in closed session -- he appears to be hunkering down for the duration . '' \nThe comment led to a call for Clapper 's firing by a member of the committee , South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham . \nIn a statement issued after the hearing , Graham said the remarks were `` not helpful to our national security interests . '' \nBut Clapper 's assessment was backed up by Lt. Gen. Ronald Burgess , the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency . \nBurgess told senators that Gadhafi `` seems to have staying power , unless some other dynamic changes at this time .

'' \nThe Obama administration has called on Gadhafi , who took power in a 1969 coup , to step down . \nFrance recognized the newly created Libyan opposition movement as the sole representative of the country on Thursday . \nAnd Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told a House committee that Washington is `` suspending '' its ties to the Libyan Embassy and reaching out to opposition leaders `` inside and outside of Libya . '' \nThe move effectively orders the embassy to close , though it stops short of breaking U.S.-Libyan diplomatic relations , a senior administration official told CNN . \n`` This is recognition that Gadhafi is no longer the legitimate leader of Libya , and therefore his representatives should leave , '' said the official , who was not authorized to speak on the record . \nLibyan Ambassador Ali Aujali abandoned Gadhafi last month , and the United States has not recognized his replacement , the official said . \nAujali met Thursday with Clinton , telling reporters afterward that they discussed whether the United States should recognize the Libyan rebels -- a move he said would `` give us room to move , and to act , and to explain our views and to be received by different countries and different officials . '' \nU.S. recognition is `` very , very important , '' he said adding that Washington `` needs `` to stop Gadhafi and his family from killing our people .

' \nThey are begging us and pleading for us to save them , and my answer is two words . \nListen to me , and I want those armed groups to listen to me real well , and I want our people in the east to hear this as well : We 're coming , '' he said . \nSaif al-Islam Gadhafi is one of two Moammar Gadhafi sons who share the first name Saif . \nOn the diplomatic front , meanwhile , opposition to Moammar Gadhafi continues to gain momentum . \nU.S. President Barack Obama reiterated Friday that he wants the Libyan leader to `` step down . '' \nHe added that he `` wo n't take -LRB- the -RRB- decision lightly '' to decide whether to use military force , including helping enforce a no-fly zone , saying it is critical to `` balance costs versus benefits . '' \nObama noted that NATO officials will meet Tuesday to consider whether to implement a no-fly zone . \nHe said U.S. actions so far , including freezing assets and other sanctions , are `` slowly tightening the noose '' on Gadhafi . \n`` We have moved about as swiftly as an international coalition has ever moved to impose sanctions , '' he said . \nThe U.S. Treasury Department beefed up those sanctions Friday , freezing the assets of nine more individuals . \nAmong them are the wife and four sons of Libya 's leader , including Saadi , Hannibal , Muhammad and Saif Al-Arab Gadhafi . \nLibya 's defense minister , military intelligence director , external security organization head and public works coordinator are also included . \nAlso Friday , U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon introduced former Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdul Ilah Khatib as his new special envoy to Libya . \nKhatib will leave New York over the weekend , accompanied by humanitarian and U.N. officials , to `` convey , in no uncertain terms , the concerns of the United Nations and the international community , '' Ban said . \n`` I -LRB- hope -RRB- that this effort ... will succeed in stopping the killings and ending the suffering of the civilian population , in addressing their humanitarian needs and in preserving the unity of the Libyan people and the territorial integrity of their homeland , '' Khatib said , adding that Gadhafi 's government `` welcomed '' the visit . \nIn Brussels , Belgium , the European Council , a body of the European Union , issued a declaration saying Gadhafi `` must relinquish power immediately . '' \n`` His regime has lost all legitimacy and is no longer an interlocutor for the EU . \nThe European Union has adopted restrictive measures against the country 's leadership and against entities holding sizeable assets controlled by the regime and stands ready to adopt further sanctions . \n`` The objective is for Libya to rapidly embark on an orderly transition to democracy through a broad-based dialogue . \nThe European Union welcomes and encourages the interim transitional national council based in Benghazi which it considers a political interlocutor . '' \nSome members are clearer than others in their support for the National Transitional Council as the legitimate representative of the Libyan people . \nFrench President Nicolas Sarkozy said in his news conference that `` we consider the National Council based in Benghazi as the proper interlocutors for Libya and they need to be recognized as such and encouraged . '' \nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel was more cautious in her approach to the council and called them a possible interlocutor . \nSarkozy said the European Council decision is a very strong one , and he stressed that a U.N. mandate and a request from the region are needed for intervention . \n`` We are considering and examining all necessary options to deal with the situation , '' he said . \n`` We can not stand by and watch this happen . '' \nHe would n't say whether France or Britain would take unilateral military action if a U.N. mandate was n't achieved . \nBritish Prime Minister David Cameron said in Brussels that authorities are tightening `` the net '' on Gadhafi and `` his henchman '' with tougher financial sanctions . \n`` We have added the Libyan Central Bank and the Libyan Investment Authority to the Libyan EU asset freezing list and , in doing so , the UK has frozen a total of 12 billion pounds of Libyan assets , '' Cameron said . \nOn Friday , the Libyan ambassador to the United States and to the United Nations will call on the United States to follow France 's lead and recognize the opposition as the legitimate representative of Libya . \nU.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has announced plans to meet with opposition leaders when she visits Tunisia and Egypt next week . \nShe said the United States was suspending relations with the Libyan Embassy in Washington , and an administration official added that the embassy `` must shut down .

{"id": "341", "time": "2011-03-11", "text": "By Pam Benson , CNN National Security Producer Gadhafi likely to survive revolt ? \nNEW : Spokeswoman says Clapper is standing by his comments on Libya NEW : National security adviser : Clapper was giving a `` flat-out resources analysis '' In testimony , he said Libyan regime would `` prevail '' over rebels , prompting criticism His statement that China , Russia pose greatest threat to U.S. irks Sen. Carl Levin Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A spokeswoman for James Clapper said the embattled director of national intelligence stands by remarks he made Thursday `` about the current military situation in Libya '' that prompted a leading Republican senator to call for his resignation . \nThe Obama administration also said Clapper still has its `` full faith and confidence . '' \nSen. Lindsey Graham , R-South Carolina , a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee , issued a statement criticizing Clapper 's testimony , made during a committee hearing earlier in the day , that Moammar Gadhafi 's regime would `` prevail '' over rebels seeking to oust the 68-year-old dictator from power in Libya . \n`` His comments will make the situation more difficult for those opposing Gadhafi , '' said Graham , adding they undercut U.S. efforts and should not have been made in a public forum . \nGraham cited two previous occasions in which Clapper made misstatements , and said his comments on the Libya situation `` should be the final straw . '' \nJamie Smith , director of public affairs for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence , said that Clapper 's testimony `` provided a snapshot of the relative strengths and weaknesses of the regime and the opposition . \nAs he stated in his testimony , the situation in Libya is very fluid . '' \n`` Many factors will come into play over time including the pressure being brought to bear by the international community as well as the Libyan people 's clear desire for change , '' Smith said . \n`` As this dynamic situation evolves , the Intelligence Community will continue to provide its best assessment of the current situation as well as identify opportunities that project into the future . '' \nClapper 's comment on Libya was not the only one that got him in trouble with some members of the armed services committee . \nIn an exchange with Democratic Sens. Carl Levin of Michigan and Joe Manchin of West Virginia over what nation posed the greatest threat to the United States , the director focused his responses on the chief nuclear rivals , China and Russia , rather than on the regimes in North Korea and Iran , which are openly belligerent . \nClapper went on to clarify his answer , to which Levin gave lukewarm acceptance , but later Thursday , Senate Intelligence Chairman Dianne Feinstein , D-California , called the director 's response on the threat issue `` a problem '' and , when asked by CNN , pointedly declined to say she had confidence in him . \n`` On the question on the two nations with the greatest intent to harm ours , I do not believe they 're China and Russia , '' said Feinstein , who was not at the hearing . \n`` I do n't understand why that was put out there . \nSo , that 's a problem . '' \nAsked whether Clapper has problems communicating , Feinstein responded , `` I do n't know what it is and I 'm not going to speculate , but clearly there 's a problem ... I would like the opportunity to look more deeply into it , OK ? '' \nOther senators , including John McCain , R-Arizona , and Joseph Lieberman , a Connecticut independent who caucuses with Democrats , expressed support for Clapper . \nMcCain said the director was `` doing a very fine job . '' \nWhite House press secretary Jay Carney defended Clapper and said his words were misinterpreted . \n`` If you look closely at the transcript of what Director Clapper said , he was answering a question with regard to military capacity , '' Carney said . \n`` Obviously , Russia and China are two of the three largest nuclear powers in the world , therefore they have dangerous weapons and they have the capacity , but he made clear that we do not view Russia and China as a threat . '' \nAnd in a follow-up answer regarding Clapper 's Libya statement , Carney said Graham 's response `` was based on a real misinterpretation of what Director Clapper said today . '' \nAsked if the president still had confidence in Clapper , Carney said , `` Yes , full faith and confidence . '' \nIn a conference-call phone briefing Thursday night , National Security Adviser Tom Donilon said he believed Clapper `` was presenting a kind of a flat-out resources analysis '' of the situation in Libya . \n`` He went through the kind of equipment and resources that the regime has . '' \n`` And I think if you look at it , he said from a standpoint of attrition , if you do an attrition analysis , you get to his conclusion . '' \nIn the same conference call , Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes addressed the issue of specific adversary nations , saying the issue is `` a matter of capability -LRB- in the case of China and Russia -RRB- versus intent '' to be a U.S. adversary `` that leads you to focus on nations such as North Korea , organizations such as al Qaeda , who again are a great focus of what we do here every day . '' \nThat seemed to be the thrust of Clapper 's protracted exchange on Thursday after Manchin asked Clapper what nations he thought posed the greatest threat to the United States . \nClapper said Russia and China posed a mortal threat , citing their nuclear arsenals and military capabilities . \nBut he added that he did n't think either nation had the intent to strike the United States . \nThat clearly was not the answer Levin expected . . \n`` You did n't mention Iran or North Korea , which would have been the first two countries I would have thought of in response to that question , '' the committee chairman . \n`` I was really kind of taken aback almost by your answer . '' \nClapper explained that he interpreted the question to be what countries pose a `` mortal threat '' to the United States . \n`` Iran and North Korea are , you know of great concern . \nI do n't know at this point in time they pose a direct mortal threat to the continental United States , '' he said . \nLevin pressed Clapper on whether Russia and China were a direct mortal threat to the United States , and Clapper reiterated that they both had the capability , but it was unlikely they had the intent . \nLevin then flipped the question : `` By that measure we represent the direct mortal threat to both of them , right ? '' \nClapper seemed to avoid a direct answer but eventually answered yes . \nManchin stepped in to to see if he could clarify Clapper 's position by asking which nation has the intent to be the greatest adversary . \nClapper answered , `` Probably China , '' which once again set Levin off . \n`` I 'm just as surprised by that answer as I was by your first answer , '' Levin said . \nClapper tried to explain that he was `` loath '' to pick one country and restated that both China and Russia have the capability , but he did n't think either had the intent . \nLevin suggested Clapper needs to be more careful with his words . \n`` When the Director of National Intelligence talks about what are the greatest threats , unless he starts with capabilities , and uses that , and does n't just answer ` China and Russia ' the way he did -- I was concerned by the answer .

'' \nBattles also raged in and around the eastern city of Ras Lanuf and many other cities , with the regime using planes and heavy artillery in its effort to reclaim areas that had been taken by the opposition . \nLibya 's state TV reported that `` Ras Lanuf has been cleansed from the armed gangs connected to al Qaeda . '' \nA doctor who worked in Ras Lanuf said at least three people were killed and 30 wounded in fighting before the main hospital had to be evacuated . \nDoctors at a hospital in the city of al-Brega reported two deaths and more than 20 people wounded in fighting in Ras Lanuf . \nOpposition forces could be seen retreating from the city . \nSome fighters said they had pulled back to a checkpoint five miles east of the city , but it was not clear who was in control of the city . \nCNN 's Ben Wedeman said the rebel forces appeared in disarray . \n`` It 's been a very chaotic effort on the part of the opposition fighters from the beginning , '' he said , adding that they had no command-and-control structure and little discipline . \nHe credited them for their enthusiasm and spirit , but added , `` Once the going gets tough , the ranks start to fall apart and it descends into anarchy , chaos . '' \nReporter : Libyan army fired at civilians Saif Gadhafi , a son of Moammar Gadhafi and a prominent spokesman for the regime , vowed to retake eastern Libya as well and insisted his father still commanded support . \n`` I receive hundreds of calls from the east daily and they are saying , ` Save us . ' \nThey are begging us and pleading for us to save them and my answer is two words . \nListen to me and I want those armed groups to listen to me real well , and I want our people in the east to hear this as well : We 're coming . '' \nHe bristled at the possibility of military intervention . \n`` The Libyan people they will never welcome NATO or Americans , '' he said . \n`` Libya is not a piece of cake ; we are not a Mickey Mouse . '' \nThough the Libyan government forces appeared to advance on the ground , the opposition gained momentum internationally . \nThe French government recognized the newly created Libyan opposition movement as the sole representative of the country and the British foreign secretary spoke to an opposition representative over the phone . \nIn response , Libyan state TV said the Gadhafi government would consider ending its relationship with France . \nIn the United States , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced plans to meet with opposition leaders . \nShe said the United States was suspending relations with the Libyan Embassy in Washington , and an administration official added the embassy `` must shut down . '' \nBut an official told CNN that `` ending the operations of the Libyan Embassy does not mean we 're cutting off diplomatic ties with Libya . '' \nProtests against the 68-year-old Gadhafi began February 15 as anti-government demonstrators sought his ouster after nearly 42 years of rule , and the discontent devolved into a fierce and bloody civil war . \nAmerica 's top U.S. intelligence official , James Clapper , took note of Libya 's military prowess at a Senate Armed Services Committee meeting Thursday . \nHe said Gadhafi is in the fight for the long haul , with military far superior to that of the opposition . \nClapper described the Libyan air defense as `` substantial , '' saying it is the region 's second-largest , after Egypt , but he did not address how fighting would fare against Libya if a no-fly zone or other military strategies were imposed . \nHe said Gadhafi has a lot of aircraft , although many are not operational . \nTo `` some extent , '' he said , the aircraft have been used for attacks , but they have caused more structural damage than injury . \nIn Brussels , Belgium , NATO defense ministers discussed the option of a no-fly zone over the North African country . \nIts secretary-general said any move to impose one would require a clear mandate from the United Nations . \nNATO also decided to bolster its presence in the Mediterranean Sea and perform detailed planning on humanitarian assistance . \nInternational military officials say the imposition of a no-fly zone could be complicated , but some opposition figures -- such as Mustafa Abdul-Jalil , a former justice minister who quit last month in protest and now heads the interim government in eastern Libya -- are advocating for the move . \nGadhafi has said that imposing such a zone would simply unite Libyans behind him . \nSaying NATO is `` united , '' `` vigilant , '' and `` ready to act , '' Anders Fogh Rasmussen , the group 's secretary-general , said the body has begun round-the-clock airborne surveillance of Libya 's airspace . \n`` Time is of the essence , '' he said , adding that the crisis requires `` close international coordination '' among organizations such as NATO , the United Nations , the European Union , the African Union , and the Arab League . \nU.S. authorities have frozen $ 32 billion in assets tied to the Libyan regime , White House spokesman Jay Carney said . \nBritish Foreign Secretary William Hague spoke by telephone with Mahmoud Jabril , the National Transitional Council 's special envoy . \nHe said European foreign ministers on Thursday talked about how the EU should react `` to the continuing appalling and unacceptable actions '' of the regime . \nHague `` made clear that planning was under way on a full range of responses , including the possible establishment of a no-fly zone , '' the Foreign Office said in a statement . \n`` It would need international support , a clear trigger and a legal basis . \nHe also said that another diplomatic mission would be sent to Benghazi shortly . '' \nAt the NATO meeting , U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said a no-fly zone option was still being considered , but was only in the planning stages . \nGates added that any military response to Libya would need the United Nations to sanction it . \nRussian President Dmitry Medvedev signed an executive order banning the sale to Libya of arms , ammunition and military equipment , according to the Kremlin 's website . \nThe Council of the European Union Thursday announced it will extend restrictions against Libyan entities . \nAs for Gadhafi 's government , it has sought to influence international sentiment , announcing that its secretary of state for international relations will travel to Portugal , Greece and Malta on an exploratory , fact-finding mission that may include other destinations . \nThe country has also invited British , French , Dutch and German fact-finding teams to examine reports of aerial bombardment and massacres . \nNone has taken up Gadhafi on the offer . \nDeath toll estimates have ranged from more than 1,000 to as many as 2,000 . \nAs of Thursday morning , the war had forced out nearly 250,000 people , many of them poor migrant workers who have been stranded at both the Tunisian and Egyptian borders , the U.N. refugee agency said . \nThe United States will soon send disaster relief teams into eastern Libya , White House National Security Adviser Thomas Donilon said . \nHe said the teams ' activities should not be viewed as military operations . \nU.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay on Thursday condemned the detention and possible torture by Libyan authorities of a BBC news team working to cover the conflict in Zawiya . \nThe journalists , released from detention in Libya Wednesday , told of beatings and mock executions . \nThe Guardian , a British daily newspaper , reported that one of its correspondents , Ghaith Abdul-Ahad , was missing . \nHe was traveling with Andrei Netto of the Brazilian newspaper Estado , who was detained by authorities while reporting from Libya , the Guardian said . \nNetto was released Thursday and was to leave the country Friday . \nCNN 's Ben Wedeman , Pam Benson , Jill Dougherty , Whitney Hurst , Jonathan Wald and Journalist Saskya Vandoorne contributed to this report \n"}

Weldon to urge Gadhafi to step down , calls for cease-fire Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As rebel and pro-government forces in Libya maneuvered on the battlefield Wednesday , Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi urged U.S. President Barack Obama to end the NATO bombing of his war-torn country . \nGadhafi made the appeal in a letter to the American president , a senior administration official said . \nBut the official said there was `` nothing new '' in the letter , the thrust of which was an appeal for an end to the alliance 's air operations . \nIt contained no offers to negotiate or step down , and the official said the administration is n't taking the note seriously . \nGadhafi asked Obama to stop the `` unjust war against a small people of a developing country '' and said those in the opposition are terrorists and members of al Qaeda , the official said . \n`` We have been hurt more morally than physically because of what had happened against us in both deeds and words by you , '' Gadhafi wrote , according to the official . \n`` Despite all this you will always remain our son . '' \nThe strongman expressed hope that Obama wins re-election next year , the official added . \nAnd he wrote that a democratic society can not be built through missiles and aircraft . \n`` You are a man who has enough courage to annul a wrong and mistaken action , '' the leader wrote to the president . \nNATO accused of not providing support CNN talks to Libyan opposition leader Libyan rebels prepare to export crude Inside the mind of Saif Gadhafi Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the NATO strikes will stop when Gadhafi steps down and leaves the country . \n`` I do n't think there is any mystery about what is expected from Mr. Gadhafi at this time , '' Clinton said . \nThe letter came amid diplomatic , economic and military developments in Libya , which remains in a deadly stalemate as pro-Gadhafi forces battle opposition fighters demanding democracy and an end to Gadhafi 's nearly 42-year-rule . \nA British airstrike hit an oil field in the eastern Libyan town of Sarir on Wednesday , causing damage to a main pipeline , Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim told reporters . \nA tanker carrying crude oil left the eastern Libyan port of Tobruk on Wednesday in what was the first known export of oil by the fledgling opposition during the conflict , a sign of optimism for them . \nRebel fighters and pro-Gadhafi forces have been pushing back and forth between al-Brega and Ajdabiya , while residents in the western city of Misrata are spending their days in fear . \nAlso Wednesday , ex-U.S. Rep. Curt Weldon , who met with Gadhafi within the past decade , paid a visit to the Libyan capital with a cease-fire plan and a clear message to the embattled ruler that he must step down . \nWeldon , speaking in an interview with CNN affiliate WPIX-TV in New York , said he planned to meet with Gadhafi and Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim . \n`` It 's a very solemn time because there 's so much at risk here , '' said Weldon , who led a congressional delegation to Libya in 2004 and is visiting Tripoli at Gadhafi 's invitation . \nWeldon is a Republican who represented a suburban Philadelphia district . \n`` I 'm here to tell him face to face it 's time for him to leave . \nIt 's time for him to step down , allow the people to take over the government of this country . '' \nThere 's been seesaw fighting between pro- and anti-Gadhafi troops between al-Brega and Ajdabiya , CNN 's Ben Wedeman reported . \nOn Tuesday night , Gadhafi forces moved 40 kilometers -LRB- about 25 miles -RRB- from al-Brega to Ajdabiya , and then Wednesday , the rebels pushed them back 10 kilometers -LRB- six miles -RRB- . \nAt one point , rebels let loose with barrage of rockets , and they were answered by artillery and mortars . \n`` It moves back and forth , '' Wedeman reported . \nA CNN team saw equipment the rebels did n't have before such as night-vision goggles and two Milan anti-tank missiles . \nFighters said they obtained the missiles from the transitional government in Benghazi but did n't know their origin . \nRebel leaders have criticized NATO 's mission to help protect civilians in recent days , saying residents in Misrata and elsewhere have suffered under horrific attacks from pro-Gadhafi forces with little evidence of NATO air power overhead . \n`` I am extremely sorry to say this , but NATO truly disappointed us , '' Gen. Abdul Fatah Younis , the opposition 's top military official , said Tuesday . \n`` Civilians are being killed every day , including children , women and elderly . \nIf NATO will wait another week , Misrata will be finished . \nNo one will be left alive . \nDo they want to wait , and watch them die , and let this crime be a shameful disgrace for the international community forever ? '' \nNATO Brig. Gen. Mark van Uhm said weather conditions and tactics by Gadhafi regime have hindered their efforts . \nIn addition to using human shields and hiding equipment in populated areas , pro-Gadhafi forces have started abandoning heavy military equipment in favor of the same kinds of cars and light trucks the rebels travel in , making it difficult for pilots to distinguish rebel convoys from those carrying forces loyal to the regime , van Uhm said . \nNATO is operating under a Security Council resolution authorizing the use of force to protect Libyan civilians . \nU.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is `` deeply concerned about the deterioriating situation facing civilians in Libyan cities under military attack , '' according to a statement . \nConditions in Misrata are `` especially grave , '' the statement said , `` with reports of the use of heavy weapons to attack the city , where the population is trapped and unable , as a result of heavy shelling that has continued over several weeks , to receive basic supplies , including clean water , food and medicines . '' \nBut residents in Misrata said this week that Gadhafi forces have trapped the city , with snipers shooting indiscriminately . \nAccess to food has been hampered . \n`` Normal life is a luxury that we do n't have , '' one resident said . \n`` I have n't taken my family out for four weeks now . \nAll schools are closed , my children did n't go to school since the 19th of February . \nAll government offices are closed . \nEven dead people are buried without death certificates . '' \nAfter weeks of relentless fighting , a military victory for either side seems remote . \nA political or diplomatic solution might be the only way to end the crisis . \nWeldon said that in addition to his proposals for Gadhafi 's stepping down , a cease-fire on both sides and the withdrawal of government forces from key cities , he is calling for a halt in further advances by rebel forces ; the creation of a joint interim government run by Libya 's current prime minister and the opposition leader ; unfettered humanitarian access ; and the establishment of a parliamentary commission that would include U.S. , Middle Eastern , European and African politicians helping to establish a new parliament in Libya . \nAs for the Gadhafi family , Weldon 's proposals also suggest a possible title for Gadhafi as honorary chairman of the African Union and allowing his second-oldest son , Saif , to stand in elections . \nOn the economic front , the tanker with crude oil that left Tobruk was sailing to Qatar , where the oil will be refined , CNN confirmed . \nFinal destination of the export is not known at this time . \nThe civil war in Libya has severely curtailed oil exports from the North African nation , which produced some 1.6 million barrels per day last year . \nThis move symbolizes the opposition 's intent to manage the country 's affairs . \nThe U.S. Treasury has frozen more than $ 32 billion in assets held by Gadhafi and members of his regime . \nAsked whether the opposition should be able to have access to those funds , State Department spokesman Mark Toner said the United States `` is well aware there is an urgency , that the Transitional National Council does need funding if it 's to survive , and we 're looking at ways to assist that . '' \nBut Toner said he did not know the status of the $ 32 billion . \nCNN 's Nic Robertson , Reza Sayah , Ben Wedeman , Elise Labott , Jill Dougherty and Yousuf Basil contributed to this report \n"}

\nThey called you Brothers , for once , the US is seen as the good guys , please , for once , let not Oil be thicker than blood , a people want freedom . \nThey are capable of doing the ground work , just give them air cover and weapons , and freedom will happen in Libya . \nApril 6 , 2011 at 4:32 pm | Reply You have to understand the nature of the human being . \nThey called you `` brothers '' . \n... for how long will they ?

\nApril 6 , 2011 at 6:02 pm | Reply I agree we ca n't blindly go in there and be stupid , but assisting with things like training , communications , securing sea access for Misurata -LRB- to allow aid to get in -RRB- and channels for the rebels to sell oil and such might be a good idea . \nRebels can buy weapons themselves so I do n't even know this is being discussed . \nI find the idea rather stupid . \nThe only reason for the US in particular to give away weapons is if we 're going to give away high-tech US military hardware that is difficult to find elsewhere . \nEven if its not the high tech stuff its just a bad idea politically and in every other way . \nLet Egypt and other countries worry about sale of arms to the Rebels and the US can help facilitate this transfer but it should n't be directly giving them away . \nWith that being said , I am growing less and less concerned about US\\/European image in the world because everyone needs to see that the interests of countries ' leaders and the interests of the people are NOT the same . \nThis is just as true in the US as in the middle east . \nI do n't advocate violence against the government or anything -LRB- unless the military started shooting peaceful protesters like it did in Libya , Egypt , Tunisia , Yemen , Bahrain , etc -RRB- but I do think our government needs to get its act together because it is currently not representing its regular citizens ... especially when it comes to the economy . \nA country that uses government contracts as a way to funnel billions of dollars to campaign supporters ; lets executives triple their salaries while sending jobs overseas and cutting benefits and gutting R&D and customer service and other pillars of their own company ; and allows Wall Street to grow rich off irresponsible practices that crash the economy is NOT FAIR . \nThis is NOT the responsibility of regular citizens to pay for this in lost jobs , wages and government services and a government that does this is no more legitimate than the governments were in Egypt and Tunisia . \nSo I therefore do not care about the US image and hope citizens follow the example of Egypt and Tunisia and realize that such positive change can happen in the US too with the departure of our elite . \nApril 6 , 2011 at 8:22 pm | Reply and it starts with campaign finance reform and a push to ratify a constitutional amendment to subvert Citizens United v.

I agree totally on campaign finance reform , but unfortunately I no longer have any hope for even something as simple as that without our entire government stepping down and regular people WHO DID N'T RECEIVE CAMPAIGN FUNDS taking control . \nI personally find the belief that votes actually matter and that they listen to us and that someday the government is going to get someone who represents us incredibly naive and wishful thinking . \nThese people in power do n't represent us , are never going to represent us , and if confronted like Egypt and Tunisia are going to use everything short of live ammunition to protect the economic interests they represent . \nThe entire system runs off corruption and pushing for a constitutional reform through legitimate channels is a total waste of time with these people . \nHate to say it , but protest to the level of Egypt and Tunisia is the ONLY way our country can get back to level footing . \nApril 8 , 2011 at 11:50 pm | Mojehdeen ward and miss understood how you calling terrors you Jack as @ , we just normal Libyan citizen how fights of their safety and freedom for their future , Gaddfee is the terrorist the history has approved . \nyou just another person that Gadffee paid to talk today . \nyou must know how are the rebel before you talk Coward April 10 , 2011 at 10:38 am | Reply I feel that we could risk arming them with small arms , but anything more would be repeating history . \nAs much as some people want to see the libyan rebels tote our guns and boot Gadhafi out of office , we could be playing with a double edged sword , because what if someone is put into office WORSE than Gadhafi . \nAnd for some obscure reason they decided to ... oh try to secure more oil reserves in the middle east , and we would have to do something about that , but they 'd just be using . . \nour weapons ... against us ... so in all reality i think that arming the rebels would just be more of our tax money going into , a rather dangerous toliet . \nGadhafi is practically begging us to stop the bombing . \nI think that that small skirmish we got into i decisively over . \nApril 6 , 2011 at 10:35 pm | Reply Honestly , I would be surprised if Green Berets were n't already there covertly training some of the rebels . \nArming and training peoples who seek freedom from an oppressive regime is the very reason why the Green Berets were formed . \nApril 7 , 2011 at 4:21 am | Reply HMMM ...

'' \nThe two women spoke on Tuesday . \nAl-Obeidy told her mother that a court employee pulled a weapon on her when she went to a courthouse . \nThe 29-year-old law school graduate burst into a Tripoli hotel last month to tell her story to journalists . \nAuthorities rushed her away from the hotel , but she is no longer in custody . \nStill , she told CNN 's `` AC360 '' Tuesday she fears for her safety in Tripoli , which she called a `` large prison . '' \nShe said authorities had taken her passport and were not letting her cross into Tunisia . \nAl-Obeidy said she spent 72 hours under interrogation after being dragged away from the Tripoli hotel where she tried to tell journalists about her alleged abuse . \nShe has said the public statements from a state TV anchor and government officials , who initially called her mentally ill , drunk and a prostitute , have ruined her reputation . \nAhmad , who lives in the eastern Libyan city of Tobruk , said her daughter told her in the call `` she was trapped . \nShe said , ` They 're taking me back and forth , interrogating me , hitting me . ' \nShe said , ` They want to kill me . \nHelp me , come and get me , ' she said . \n` Where are the human rights groups ? ' '' \nAsked how she is coping , Ahmad said , `` Our hope in God is very strong .

'' \nBut two days later , protests against Col. Moammar Gadhafi 's 41-year rule erupted in the eastern city of Benghazi . \nAs protests spread to other cities and towns across the country , the Gadhafi regime embarked on a bloody crackdown . \nToday , the country is split into territories controlled by loyalists and opposition rebels . \nA NATO military alliance is now into the fourth month of a campaign of airstrikes against government targets after the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution authorizing the use of force to protect civilian lives . \nThe civil war has all but shattered ambitious plans to upgrade transport , housing and infrastructure in a country that had long been isolated from the international community . \n`` The main objective was to create capacity for the economy to stand on its feet away from oil and gas production , '' recalled Zlitni somewhat wistfully , as he described a five-year , $ 170 billion plan to modernize Libya . \nIn March , the legions of foreign workers who had been contracted to build railroads , airports , apartment buildings and telecommunications networks began fleeing the rapidly escalating conflict by the tens of thousands . \nThe exodus included large numbers of engineers , construction and oil workers from China , Turkey , Egypt , and the Philippines , who crossed the western border with Tunisia on foot . \nAt the time , many of them told CNN stories of being robbed at gunpoint by Libyan security forces who took their cell phones , laptops and money . \nLeft behind were mammoth construction projects that still dot the Libyan landscape . \nMany of these unfinished structures were apartment buildings being built for an estimated 50,000 families across the country . \n`` So many infrastructure projects ... were carried out by international companies , '' Zlitni said . \n`` Yet the stoppage of these projects could be felt in the economy . \nParticularly in the building sectors , the transportation sectors , the communication sectors . '' \nMore ominous for the Libyan economy has been the Tripoli government 's growing isolation . \nNATO is enforcing a no-fly zone over Gadhafi-controlled territory as well as a virtual blockade of Libyan ports . \nThe sanctions have created huge fuel shortages . \nLong lines of cars now wait at service stations . \nThis week , the government in Tripoli announced it was intervening to control rising prices of basic commodities . \n`` In a crisis situation like this traders tend to profit more than they should , and therefore there is an intervention by the ministry of foreign trade for the prices of consumer goods , '' Zlitni said . \nThe minister said the government was fixing prices of rice , flour , meat , eggs , sugar and edible oils to prevent hardship among lower-income families . \n`` We subsidize , basically , '' Zlitni said , `` with large amount of funds . '' \nBut Zlitni warned it was growing increasingly difficult for the embattled Gadhafi regime to pay for these types of subsidies . \nHe pointed out that foreign countries have frozen tens of billions of dollars in Libyan government assets that had been carefully invested overseas in `` treasury bills , bonds , stocks and investments in various international markets , whether in Europe , the USA or Asia . '' \nZlitni compared Libya 's dwindling government coffers to the edible meat on an animal . \n`` This should n't last long , otherwise we 'll be eating the fat and meat . \nAnd we 'll very soon arrive to the bones . '' \nThroughout the hour-long interview , Zlitni made no mention of the fact that last month , the U.N. Security Council added his name to a list of high-ranking officials in the Gadhafi regime now facing an international travel ban . \nHe did , however , declare Tripoli 's opposition to proposals to hand over frozen Libyan government bank accounts to the opposition Transitional National Council headquartered in Benghazi . \nLast week , U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced Washington formally recognized the council in Benghazi as Libya 's legitimate governing authority . \nState department officials said this could potentially give Benghazi access to some $ 30 billion in frozen Libyan funds in the United States . \n`` This is against international rules . \nThe international monetary system can not withstand action in this manner , '' Zlitni said . \n`` If you are freezing through United Nations Security Council action funds for any country , then you ca n't confiscate it . \nThere are legal obligations of the banks . '' \nBut when asked what recourse Tripoli would have if the U.S. government went through with its threat , Zlitni conceded there are few options . \n`` We should file litigation against them , '' he said . \n"}

'' \nIbrahim said Gadhafi 's troops successfully fought off waves of rebel attacks over the last five days , with 30 government troops and 500 rebel fighters killed . \nThe claim could not be independently verified . \nCol. Ahmed Banni , a spokesman for the rebel Transitional National Council , said fighting broke out over the weekend after the rebels pulled out thousands of land mines and secured a path for movement toward the strategic oil town . \nPro-Gadhafi troops dug a trench and filled it with oil only to set it alight as a line of defense near the eastern entrance of the city , he said . \n`` So this may delay our plan to take over the city , since they have linked the trench to an oil pipeline so they keep the fire going , '' Banni added . \nA rebel fighter who did not want to be named said a small rebel force entered the city and clashed with pro-Gadhafi forces , killing at least 11 and injuring dozens among rebel ranks . \nGadhafi forces withdrew ahead of the rebels , but re-grouped and launched a counter-attack , Banni said . \n`` I can tell that the communication between the Gadhafi brigades is not too good , since they did not immediately fire at our expeditionary troops with Grad missiles . \nThat 's what they usually do , but there was hesitation this time , '' Banni said . \nU.S. to Libya : Gadhafi must go U.S. , Libya officials in talks Food shortages in Western Libya Officials with the Gadhafi government in Tripoli have denounced the assault on al-Brega . \nAt the start of the latest round of fighting on Thursday , Ibrahim accused the NATO alliance of coordinating with rebels to mount a land , sea and air attack . \nHe said the attack exceeded the mandate of United Nations Security Council resolutions that authorize the use of force in order to protect Libyan civilians . \nIn the meantime , NATO announced it struck more targets in the Libyan capital on Monday . \nFor the first time , NATO forces attacked Tripoli 's main international airport . \nLibyan officials brought journalists to see a radar tower that was bombed in a predawn attack . \nThe remarkably precise strike damaged only the top of the radar tower , while also shattering windows in a neighboring office building . \nA NATO military statement accused the Tripoli regime of using the radar device to track warplanes and warn pro-Gadhafi forces of impending airstrikes . \nOfficials at the airport scoffed at these claims . \n`` It is 100 % civilian , '' said acting airport director Naji Daw , pointing at the twisted metal at the top of the red-and-white tower . \nDaw said two people were lightly wounded by the attack . \n`` They want us to go back to 100 years ago , '' he said , adding that the airport will now have to rely on an outdated back-up system to track air traffic . \nNot far away , Libyan commercial airliners sat motionless on the tarmac . \nSince NATO and US forces imposed a no-fly zone on Libya last March , this once bustling gateway to Tripoli has been barely operational . \nDaw said the airport now received occasional United Nations and Red Cross flights , as well as planes carrying foreign diplomatic delegations . \nCNN 's Amir Ahmed , Ivan Watson and Jomana Karadsheh contributed to this report . \n"}

Kennedy 's inaugural address that said we would pay any price , meet any burden in the defense of liberty . \nA half century ago , Americans rallied to JFK 's call , but today , when Americans are weary of war and feeling broke , perhaps people will find his more cautious approach more appealing . \nHow did you interpret his `` doctrine '' and what do you think of it ? \nGive the president credit : His speech has advanced an important dialogue not only about Libya but about American leadership in the world . \nWhat did you think ? \nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Gergen . \n"}

William Gortney of the Joint Chiefs of Staff . \nGortney described the brigade as `` one of the most active in terms of attacking innocent people . '' \nLibya 's state TV on Monday night broadcast live footage from Gadhafi 's Tripoli compound of Khamis Gadhafi dressed in uniform and greeting people . \nPrior to the broadcast there had been unconfirmed reports that the younger Gadhafi had died from injuries he suffered when a plane flown by a disgruntled Libyan pilot crashed into a military compound while he was there . \nABC News was the first to report Khamis Gadhafi 's recent stay in the United States . \nGadhafi opposition runs into resistance AECOM has business dealings with Libya . \nThe younger Gadhafi traveled from coast to coast meeting with high-tech companies , universities and defense contractors . \nHis itinerary included stops in San Francisco , Los Angeles , Colorado , Chicago , Houston , Washington and New York City . \nKhamis Gadhafi left the United States for Libya on February 17 . \nPaul Gennaro , the senior vice president and chief communications officer for AECOM , issued a statement saying , `` The educational internship , which consisted of publicly available information , was aligned with our efforts to improve quality of life , specifically in Libya , where we were advancing public infrastructure such as access to clean water ; quality housing ; safe and efficient roads and bridges ; reliable and affordable energy ; and related projects that create jobs and opportunity .

'' \n`` Once he makes that decision , I think the international community will come together and make a determination as to what the most appropriate way of facilitating him stepping down will be , '' Obama said . \nThe interviews continued the determined tone of Obama 's Monday night speech , which detailed the strategic and moral reasons for committing U.S. troops to the Libyan mission while also promising the U.S. role would be limited in time and scope . \nInitially led by U.S. forces due to their `` unique capabilities '' for taking out Libya 's anti-aircraft and communications stations to establish a no-fly zone , the mission shifts to NATO control this week so allied nations share the responsibility and costs , Obama said . \nHe pointed out to CBS that coalition airstrikes on Gadhafi forces threatening civilian populations `` will continue for some time '' despite the transfer in mission leadership . \n`` One of the questions that we want to answer is , do we start getting to a stage where Gadhafi 's forces are sufficiently degraded , where it may not be necessary to arm opposition groups ?

James Stavridis says there is no evidence of a significant presence of al Qaeda in the Libyan opposition . \nHe sees `` more than reasonable '' chance Gadhafi will leave power Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- There is a good chance NATO pressure will encourage Libyan tyrant Moammar Gadhafi to leave power , the U.S. NATO commander told Congress Tuesday , but the opposition that could come in the Libyan leader 's wake has `` flickers '' of al Qaeda . \nWhile there is a wide range of possible outcomes in Libya , running from a static stalemate to Gadhafi cracking , there is a `` more than reasonable '' chance of Gadhafi leaving power , Adm. James Stavridis said before the Senate Armed Services Committee , But potential `` flickers '' of al Qaeda and Hezbollah elements have been seen in intelligence regarding the Libyan opposition , which is poised to take power if Gadhafi leaves , Stavridis said . \nHowever , he added there is no evidence of a significant presence of al Qaeda or other terrorist groups . \nStavridis is also the commander of U.S. European Command . \n`` The intelligence that I 'm receiving at this point makes me feel that the leadership that I 'm seeing are responsible men and women who are struggling against Col. Gadhafi , '' Stavridis added . \nThe comments come the same day as U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton met with a leader of Libya 's opposition in London . \nClinton and the heads of 40 other countries met Tuesday to discuss Libya 's future . \nA senior counterterrorism official , unnamed because he is not authorized to speak on the record , backed up Stavridis ' assessment , downplaying the concern about al Qaeda among the Libyan opposition . \nThere is probably `` a sprinkling of extremists to perhaps include al Qaeda '' in Libya among the rebels , `` but no one should think the opposition is being led by al Qaeda or one of its affiliates , '' the official said . \nAl Qaeda has had a presence in North Africa for years . \nIt `` would n't be surprising if small numbers -- a handful '' -- of extremists or al Qaeda are in Libya . \n`` It 's hard to tell who all the leaders are in the opposition , '' the official said , but `` the rebels do not appear to be adopting an al Qaeda bent or ideology in Libya . '' \nIf Gadhafi 's forces cease fighting there would be a series of decisions on how NATO should proceed . \nLeading the senators through the NATO command chain , Stavridis said the intelligence and ground assessments would work their way up through NATO , first going through Canadian Gen. Charles Bouchard leading the NATO operation in Libya , then up to Stavridis and eventually going up to the United Nations for the ultimate decision on course of action , Stavridis said . \n`` I think there would be actually another level that this discussion would have to go to , which would be the United Nations since the authority for NATO to participate in this operation is under the United Nations Security Council resolutions 1970 and 1973 , '' Stavridis pointed out . \nDuring this process there would be a pause in NATO activity over Libya . \nBut for now the fight is still very much on . \nNo-fly air zones have been set up to allow air assets to strike Libyan forces if the civilian population is threatened , Stavridis said , going beyond a basic no-fly zone patrol mission . \nFor the first time , A-10 and AC-130 ground attack aircraft were used over the weekend in Libya , Vice Adm. Bill Gortney said at a press briefing on Monday . \nThese aircraft fire machine gun rounds from cannons , up to thousands of rounds a minute , and due to their low-altitude flying ability provide more precision in densely populated areas . \nOn Monday night , one A-10 aircraft attacked Libyan coast guard ships in the port of Misrata after reports were confirmed that the ships were firing at merchant vessels . \nNATO is set to take control of the full operation in Libya including protecting civilians on Thursday , greatly easing the financial costs on the United States , which has already hit $ 550 million as of Monday , according to Pentagon figures . \nOf those costs , 60 % were for munitions , the Pentagon said , including Tomahawk missiles , which cost $ 1.4 million each . \nThe United States has launched approximately 200 since the beginning of the operation . \n`` Future costs are highly uncertain , '' Pentagon spokeswoman Cmdr. Kathleen Kessler said , but the U.S. expects to incur another $ 40 million in costs over the next three weeks . \nAfter the transition to NATO control is complete , the Pentagon expects the cost of the U.S. support operation to drop significantly , costing $ 40 million per each subsequent month . \nCNN 's Pam Benson contributed to this report \n"}

Lugar says the use of military force should have been debated Gates says the goal is to increase pressure for Gadhafi 's ouster No evidence so far of missile strikes killing civilians , Gates says Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Presidential leadership or kowtowing to allies ? \nAbuse of power or decisive action in the face of imminent catastrophe ? \nSupporters and critics used Sunday talk shows to debate President Barack Obama 's Libya policy on Sunday , the day before the president addresses the nation on the issue . \nThe speech Monday night follows calls from all quarters for Obama to clarify the reason he sent U.S. forces to head the U.N.-authorized military mission intended to prevent Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi from unleashing his military on his own people . \nObama has said that U.S. policy is the ouster of Gadhafi . \nHowever , the mandate of the military coalition is only to enforce a no-fly zone and arms embargo in Libya while taking other necessary steps to protect civilians . \nDemocratic Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan , chairman of the Armed Services Committee , explained on CNN 's `` State of the Union '' that the mission 's goal is to give the Libyan people the political freedom to oust Gadhafi . \n`` We 're part of an international coalition , which has been supported now by U.N. resolution with the support of Arab countries , to prevent the slaughter of civilians in Libya , '' Levin said , adding : `` It 's going to take the people of Libya to remove their dictator with the help of economic sanctions that the world has put in place . '' \nMeanwhile , two senior Cabinet members -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Defense Secretary Robert Gates -- appeared on three programs in interviews conducted Saturday to also make the case for the Obama policy . \nWoman alleges Libyan forces raped her NATO 's role in Libya unclear `` There is no perfect option when one is looking at a situation like this , '' Clinton said on the ABC program `` This Week . '' \n`` I think that the president ordered the best available option . \nThe United States worked with the international community to make sure that there was authorization to do what we have helped to accomplish . '' \nBoth Clinton and Levin emphasized that the international support was essential to avoid any perception or accusation that the United States -- already engaged in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan -- was unilaterally committing military forces in a third Muslim country . \n`` The secret to success is a coalition , '' Levin told CNN , advocating an `` international decision where a unilateral decision could have significant downsides . '' \nFormer House Speaker Newt Gingrich , who is expected to announce his candidacy soon for the Republican presidential nomination , challenged such an approach , telling `` Fox News Sunday '' he wants Obama 's speech to be `` dramatically clearer than he has been up until now . '' \n`` I hope the president will say , first of all he is consulting the U.S. Congress , not just the Arab League and United Nations , '' Gingrich said . \n`` I hope he will say second that it 's clear that the Gadhafi dictatorship has to leave , and that we are prepared to do whatever it takes to make sure the Gadhafi dictatorship leaves . '' \nDespite his tough rhetoric , Gingrich made clear he opposes sending any U.S. ground troops to Libya -- a position also held by Obama . \n`` Once you engage air power , you should use the air power in its most effective way , '' Gingrich said . \n`` You do n't need to send in ground forces . '' \nSen. Richard Lugar of Indiana , the ranking Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee , criticized a lack of congressional debate before Obama committed military forces to the Libyan mission . \n`` There should have been a plan as to what our objectives were , a debate , before we committed armed resources , '' Lugar told the NBC program `` Meet the Press , '' later adding : `` I do n't believe we should be engaged in the Libyan civil war . \nI think the Libyans are going to have to work that out . '' \nObama has said the U.S. role in the Libyan mission will diminish once NATO takes over control and command , which could start happening as soon as Monday . \nHowever , Gates made clear that even in a diminished role , U.S. forces will still be involved in the mission as long as it continues . \n`` As long as there is a no-fly zone and we have some unique capabilities to bring to bear -- for example , intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance , some tanking aviation -- we will continue to have a presence , '' he said on ABC . \nSo far , he said , the military mission was proceeding well . \n`` I would say , for all practical purposes , the implementation of the no-fly zone is complete , '' Gates said . \n`` Now it will need to be sustained , but it can be sustained with a lot less effort than what it took to set it up . '' \nAsked if there was a problem between the military mission 's limited goal of civilian protection and Obama 's stated policy objective of ousting Gadhafi , both Gates and Clinton said no. `` You do n't , in a military campaign , set as a mission or a goal something you are not sure you can achieve , '' Gates told the CBS program `` Face the Nation . '' \n`` And as we 've learned over the past number of years , regime change is very complicated and can be very expensive and can take a long time . \nSo I think the key here was establishing a military mission that was achievable , was achievable in a limited period of time and could be sustained . '' \nOn the same program , Clinton noted how former Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic remained in power despite mounting internal and external pressure for his ouster that ended with Milosevic dying while on trial in the international war crimes court . \nShe likened that situation to Gadhafi today . \n`` It took a while for Milosevic to leave , but you could see his days were numbered even though he was n't yet out of office , '' Clinton said . \nGates joked on CBS that he `` would n't be hanging any new pictures '' if he were Gadhafi , then noted that there are several possible scenarios for the Libyan leader 's ouster . \n`` His military can turn , we could see elements of his military turning , deciding this is a no-win proposition , the families splitting , I mean any number of possibilities are out there , particularly as long as the international pressure continues , and those around him see no future in staying with him , '' Gates said . \nOn the same program , Gates also said that Gadhafi is placing bodies of people his regime has killed at the sites of some missile strikes by the U.S.-led coalition . \nGadhafi has claimed that coalition missile attacks have killed civilians , and some NATO members and Arab nations responded with concern that the Libyan military mission might exceed the intent of the U.N. Security Council resolution that authorized it . \n`` The truth of the matter is we have trouble coming up with proof of any civilian casualties that we have been responsible for , '' Gates told CBS . \n`` But we do have a lot of intelligence reporting about Gadhafi taking the bodies of the people he 's killed and putting them at the sites where we 've attacked . '' \nAsked how often it has happened , Gates replied : `` We have a number of reports of that . '' \nA senior defense official told CNN on Sunday that the U.S. military has information gleaned from intelligence sources that Gadhafi has tasked his aides to search morgues and hospitals for dead bodies to be posed as civilian casualties . \nNATO ambassadors on Sunday agreed to rules of engagement for coalition forces to follow once the alliance takes over the Libyan mission . \nA key question is how robust the NATO-led forces will be in attacking Libyan ground forces to protect civilians . \nThat does n't mean using military force to remove Gadhafi from power , Levin insisted on CNN . \n`` The people of Libya can remove their dictator , but we are not the ones to remove him , '' Levin said . \n`` We are the ones that is part of an international coalition that are going to prevent him from massacring his own people . '' \nOthers called for a more robust international role . \n`` I think we do need to consider arming the rebels and let them -- with anti-tank weapons and anti-aircraft weapons -- let them impose their own no-fly zone , '' former National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley said on CNN . \n`` In the end of the day , how this ends is when the Libyan people can overthrow the tyrant . \nThat 's the narrative we want to establish . '' \nLieberman , an independent who caucuses with the Democrats , said on Fox that the United States had chosen a side in Libya by joining the international coalition , `` and it 's the right side . '' \n`` We ought to be open about it , '' Lieberman said . \n`` We are taking a side of the freedom fighters in Libya against one of the most totalitarian regimes that has ever existed in the world , which is Gadhafi 's . \nAnd in the end of this , Gadhafi has to go , one way or the other .

'' \n`` It appears that there is a systematic policy to detain anyone suspected of opposition to Colonel al-Gaddafi 's rule , hold them incommunicado , and transfer them to his strongholds in western Libya , '' said Malcolm Smart , Amnesty International 's director for the Middle East and North Africa . \n`` Given the circumstances of their enforced disappearance there is every reason to believe that these individuals are at serious risk of torture and ill-treatment . '' \nWitness : ` Utter carnage ' in Misrata Smart called on Gadhafi to `` halt this outrageous campaign and order his forces to abide by international law . '' \nAmnesty says the documented cases `` are believed to represent only a small proportion of the total number of people who have been detained or have disappeared '' recently in Gadhafi 's custody . \nRecent video indicates the extent of the problem . \nIt shows prisoners roughed up and taunted by Gadhafi forces . \nSome of them say there were demonstrators and others deny it . \n`` The true number is impossible to establish , as the authorities in Tripoli generally do not divulge information about detainees they are holding and because many areas of the country are not accessible for independent reporting . \nSome relatives of detainees are also unwilling to publicize their names for fear of possible reprisals , '' Amnesty said . \nLibyan officials did not immediately respond to efforts to obtain a response to the Amnesty International report . \nThe cases include `` three broad categories , '' the report says : -- Government critics , pro-democracy activists , writers and others detained in the days before the February 17 `` peaceful demonstrations '' across Libya . \n`` They appear to have been arrested by the authorities as a pre-emptive strike in an effort to nip the protests in the bud following the public protests that had caused the downfall of longstanding repressive governments in Tunisia and Egypt , two of Libya 's neighbors . '' \n-- Anti-government protestors and youths who went missing on February 20 , when the Kateeba al-Fadheel , a pro-Gadhafi special forces unit , was forced to evacuate from a military compound in Benghazi after violent clashes with protesters . \n`` Amnesty International has documented the cases of nine men and boys who have not been seen since they went to the Kateeba compound area on evening of 20 February 2011 , including four teenagers under 18 . '' \n-- People captured in or near Ben Jawad , where there had been `` intermittent fighting . '' \n`` Amnesty International has obtained information about a number of individuals who went missing in the area between Ajdabiya and Ben Jawad , west of Benghazi . \nSome are believed to have been fighters , others to be civilians who went to the area in order to assist the wounded , and still others people who may have been onlookers . '' \nAmnesty said foreign journalists who had been detained and released `` have reported that they were beaten and assaulted and threatened with execution , in some cases even being subjected to mock execution , and have expressed concern about Libyans who they saw being mistreated in detention . '' \nIt said there are fears too that some detainees may be held `` as bargaining chips or to put pressure on their relatives and friends to deter them from joining the opposition . '' \nThe agency said its concerns `` are heightened by the long pattern of gross and widespread human rights violations '' that have marked Gadhafi 's rule . \n`` These include enforced disappearances , extrajudicial executions , prolonged arbitrary detention , torture and other ill-treatment , as well as severe restrictions on freedom of expression and the rights to freedom of assembly and association . '' \nAmnesty is urging the government to release peaceful protesters , ensure than any alleged captured fighters be treated humanely and given access to the Red Cross , and grant `` unhindered access '' to humanitarian groups . \nAs for Atef ` Abd al-Qader Al-Atrash , his family fears for his safety . \nOne relative told Amnesty that `` he has simply disappeared , '' and speculates he was taken to areas under the control of pro-Gadhafi forces . \n`` We kept trying to call his phone but never got through , until some days later when a man who spoke with a western -LRB- western Libyan -RRB- accent answered and said : ` this is what happens to those who throw stones at us ' . \nBut Atef had never even thrown stones , '' the relative said . \n"}

'' \nWithout these capabilities the coalition would have thought twice about the operation , Thompson says . \nWoman alleges rape by Gadhafi forces `` Our European allies would be reluctant to take on military combat in Libya unless they had support from the U.S. because there are so many advanced military systems that they do not have themselves , '' he says . \nThe U.S. role however , will not be at the forefront just because of the high-tech weaponry , says defense expert John Pike of GlobalSecurity.org . \n`` It will be more of a supporting role than a pointy end of the spear role , '' said Pike . \n`` Most of these unique capabilities are support . '' \nAt a Pentagon briefing Monday , U.S. Navy Vice Adm. Bill Gortney described the U.S. role in Libya by saying , `` Maybe we are n't flying the bulk of combat sorties any more , but the U.S. is now providing nearly 80 % of all air refueling , almost 75 % of aerial surveillance hours and 100 % of all electronic warfare missions . '' \nHere 's a partial list of what is being used by the United States in the Libya mission , based on Defense Department information , Jane 's defense publications and various analysts : -- The Global Hawk : A high-flying , unmanned aircraft that provides intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance . \nIts very long endurance allows it to stay in flight longer than any manned and unmanned aircraft . \nThe Global Hawk collects pictures and video of the ground and some versions have the ability of electronic eaves dropping . \nThis allows the aircraft to see the location of Libyan troops and activity at their various military sites . \nIt is also helpful in assessing the success of strikes on targets and bomb damage . \n-- Joint STARS -LRB- Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System -RRB- : An intelligence and surveillance aircraft with radar capabilities tucked underneath the plane . \nDifferent than the Global Hawk , this aircraft is manned . \nThe radar looks sideways at the ground , allowing it to see moving ground targets , such as Libyan tank movements . \nThe Joint STARS ' very sensitive radar system generates its own radio waves , sending them out , and then receiving radar returns , which allows it to create pictures of what is on the ground . \nOperating with radar waves allows Joint STARS to take pictures at night , without light . \n-- AWACS -LRB- Airborne Warning and Control System -RRB- : This is a radar aircraft like the Joint STARS , capable of surveillance , but is used for monitoring aircraft such as Libyan planes or helicopters , instead of monitoring ground forces . \nThe radar is a rotating dome on the top of the aircraft . \nBesides tracking enemy planes , the AWACS also monitors allied aircraft , directing friendly planes to the best location for targeting . \n-- Maritime Patrol Aircraft , P-3 : An older propeller aircraft mostly used to monitor vessels and submarines at sea but it can also track ground targets . \nEnforcing the arms embargo on Libya is a main task . \nThe aircraft can track electronic emissions like radio waves , allowing the coalition to listen in on enemy radio transmissions . \nThe P-3 is also capable of identifying the types of communication and radar systems the enemy is using by differentiating between the unique electronic signals being sent out . \n-- EA-18G Growler : An aircraft used to jam radar and other enemy communications and electronic signals . \nWith pods on its wings and under its fuselage , the Growler identifies what kind of emitters the enemy is using for its radar and communication devices . \nThen it puts out a much stronger signal on the same line , causing the enemy 's communication devices or radars to not function properly . \nThe Growler focused on disrupting Libya 's air defense radar systems in the beginning of the operation . \n-- Commando Solo : The aircraft disrupts enemy radio signals , allowing the United States to broadcast its own message on enemy channels . \nIn this operation the U.S. is transmitting messages to Moammar Gadhafi 's forces in both Arabic and in English , telling them to stop fighting and leave their weapons . \n`` Although we will not discuss specifics , Commando Solo could be used to transmit information to regime military forces to cease hostilities or broadcast humanitarian relief information to the Libyan public , such as where people can get basic food and water supplies , '' the Pentagon says . \n-- Compass Call : The aircraft disrupts the enemy 's command and control communications with electronic jamming . \nOperated by the Air Force . \nWhile a similar capability to the Growler , the Compass Call is mostly focused on taking out the Libyan forces ' communications . \nThis jamming ability causes the Libyan commanders to not be able to communicate with their forces in the field . \n-- Air refueling tankers : Basically an in-flight gas station for U.S. and coalition fighter jets enforcing the no-fly zone , allowing the jets to stay in the air longer and cover larger distances . \n"}

'' \nWhen Libyan government minders last brought CNN to Zlitan about a week and a half ago , it was to see a large pro-Gadhafi rally in the city 's main square . \nCrowds of Libyans waved green government flags , fired guns in the air , and fervently pledged their loyalty to their embattled leader . \nBut the scene was dramatically different Monday , as fire trucks and ambulances regularly raced through the city 's largely deserted streets . \nMany shops appeared to be closed , and the ominous rumble of warplanes could be heard overhead periodically . \nThe NATO alliance says it has been hitting targets it describes as tanks , `` military storage facilities '' and artillery pieces in the vicinity of Zlitan on a daily basis for the past week . \nOfficials from the embattled Gadhafi government also say the air strikes have intensified in frequency . \n`` People here call NATO the crazy one which lost its sanity , '' said Ramadan Mohamad Ramadan , an official from the local city government . \n`` It is waging wide-scale war on the people . \nThey are destroying everything . '' \nRamadan was standing in front of the rubble of a health clinic that he said had been demolished by a pre-dawn attack on Monday . \nSeveral bulldozers dug through wreckage strewn with medical supplies , including syringes , medication and even a microscope . \nGovernment officials said they were looking for the bodies of three people believed to be buried underneath , and said the bodies of eight people had been pulled out earlier in the day . \nJournalists did not see any evidence of dead or wounded at the site . \nBarely 100 yards away , however , drivers had parked a number of pick-up trucks under the cover of olive trees . \nSome of the vehicles were smeared with mud and the equipment in their chassis covered with branches -- an apparent camouflage tactic seen used by both loyalist and rebel fighters around Libya . \nUniformed troops could also be seen resting in the shade of the orchard . \nResponding to the Libyan government 's claims to journalists that a health clinic and food-storage facility had been hit , NATO had found no evidence to support the allegations , a NATO representative said . \nNATO forces had hit a number of targets near Zlitan that were `` military in nature '' Monday , the representative said . \n`` These targets were a command and control node and a vehicle storage facility that contained military vehicles . \n`` This is not the first time that such allegations have been made and as is the case with all NATO strikes a thorough damage assessment is conducted afterwards . \nAs always great care is taken to minimize the risk of civilian casualties . \n`` We are always concerned by any reports of civilian casualties , take them seriously and the appropriate analysis will be conducted to ascertain the legitimacy , or otherwise , of these allegations . '' \nIn the afternoon , government minders brought journalists to the ruins of a mosque and school located in an all-but-deserted residential neighborhood several kilometers to the east of Zlitan 's city center . \nAn air attack clearly destroyed the compound , but there were conflicting reports from government minders regarding which week the strike took place . \nAs another small group of pro-regime supporters began chanting at the ruins of the school , the thud of big guns continued to rumble . \nOne of the minders said NATO warships in the Mediterranean Sea were shelling loyalist positions , but it was impossible for CNN to confirm whether the fire was incoming or outgoing . \nTwo vehicles loaded with women , children and belongings drove past the shattered buildings , heading west -- away from the fighting . \nSuddenly , the unmistakable cloud from an air strike mushroomed up several miles away to the east . \nA four-door sedan , caked with mud and carrying several men wearing camouflage and carrying Kalashnikov rifles , drove past , also headed away from the direction of the front lines as the cloud from a second apparent air strike billowed in the distance . \n`` Come on , let 's go , '' the minders repeated . \n`` We have to go , they could bomb us here any time , '' they said , some of them visibly nervous . \nMonday 's government tour of Zlitan was over , but the fighting there appeared to have barely begun . \nCNN 's Bharati Naik contributed to this report . \n"}

'' \nWashington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- To recap : The United States and its allies are scrambling to defeat Moammar Gadhafi 's forces in Libya . \nThere 's a no-fly zone , a freezing of assets , threats about prosecution in international courts and an arms embargo . \nWe 're trying to get Gadhafi to surrender -- and , hopefully , leave . \nAnd , by the way , the president has secretly ordered the CIA to try to figure out just who the rebels are -- and whether they 're a dependable enough crew , worthy of our money or our arms . \n`` We have n't ruled out arming the rebels , '' a senior administration official tells me . \n`` But there are a lot of questions that need to be answered first -- including whether they are even trained to use what we might give them . '' \nIf the policy sounds , er , improvisational , that 's because it is . \nNaturally , any form of ad-hoc-ism is not exactly comforting , especially when it comes to foreign military intervention . \nMost often , intervention works this way : When we are attacked , we respond . \nWhen people plan to attack us , we try to prevent it . \nPresidents are asked to consult with Congress , provide a mission , goals , timetables and endgames . \nWe like to know how we 're getting out before we get in . \nWe are understandably war-weary . \nYet when the president proposes an alternative to the now unpopular all-or-nothing-go-it-alone military interventions of Iraq and Afghanistan , it 's still somehow unsettling . \nWe do n't want to go it alone . \nYet we 're not sure we trust others to take the lead . \nView from Libya 's ` shaky ' frontline Gates : Obama followed War Powers Act Kucinich : Only Congress can declare war When the president says , as he did in his speech Monday , `` We should not be afraid to act -- but the burden of action should not be America 's alone , '' we get it . \nBut we also start wondering : What happens if we 're not driving the car ? \nWe always drive the car . \nTruth is , we like to drive . \nAnd when we 're not driving , we think it 's easy -- even likely -- for the coalition to veer off course . \nSo here 's the conundrum : We do n't want to go it alone . \nYet we 're not sure we trust others to take the lead . \nAnd that 's where the Republican political play is right now . \nAnd it 's easy : Sidestep the entire question of intervention , while either -LRB- a -RRB- saying Obama took too long to do it or -LRB- b -RRB- he did it in a wimpy -LRB- and possibly self-defeating -RRB- way -LRB- spelled `` coalition '' -RRB- . \nIn other words , do n't lead . \nJust say Obama ca n't lead . \nConsider Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour , who recently complained to a local radio station that `` The Obama administration 's position has been to say , ` You know , we 're just one of the boys . \nWe 're not going to try to be the leader . ' \nAnd we see that when you do n't have strong leadership from the strongest country in the world , then everybody else scatters out and breaks up . '' \nSo , um , what 's the right thing to do ? \n`` I 'm not saying ` Do this , do that , ' '' he told WFMN radio in Jackson , Mississippi , going on to say we need to make sure we have the resources we need to accomplish the mission . \nNow is that clear ? \nMitt Romney says he supports military action , but says Obama is taking orders -- from the Arab League and the UN -- rather than giving them . \nAnd then there 's Newt Gingrich , who was for an intervention before he was against it -- at least the way Obama did it . \nRepublicans can get away with the Obama-doesn ` t-believe-in-American-exceptionalism stuff for awhile because the public itself is ambivalent . \nIn fact , a Pew poll taken on the eve of the president 's speech showed that only 47 % of Americans believed that the airstrikes in Libya were warranted . \nAnd when asked about whether there is a clear goal , the public also seemed largely unconvinced . \nMost notably , independent voters said there 's no clear goal , by a 57 % to 35 % margin . \nThe president deserves props for the immense coalition he put together , not to mention a successful vote in the UN Security Council against Libya . \nYet Obama has succeeded in making no one completely happy : Those who wanted unilateral intervention quickly say Obama has dithered , caring more about building a coalition than saving the Libyan people . \nOn the other end of the spectrum , those worried about intervention without a clear exit strategy consider Obama to be too hasty . \nSo he ca n't win . \nIf Gadhafi goes , Obama 's a hero . \nAnd all of that improvisation will suddenly look like a well-constructed sonata . \nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gloria Borger . \n"}

'' \n`` They are asking us to withdraw from our own cities and open our cities to people , who are holding up arms , who are tribal , violent , no unified leadership , al Qaeda links , and no one knows who they are . \nIf this is not mad , then I do n't know what it is , '' he said . \n`` We will not leave our cities . \nWe will not stop protecting our civilians . '' \nIbrahim added that the Libyan government is ready for peace . \nSources close to Gadhafi told CNN that political solutions are still possible but that the Libyan leader would relinquish power only to others within his inner circle . \nThey said there is still time for dialogue but expressed doubts about who would represent the opposition . \nAny transition , they said , would involve Gadhafi 's second son , Saif al-Islam Gadhafi , and for such a transition to take place there would first have to be an end to the fighting . \nThe sources added that there is an emerging consensus within the regime that the old guard must prepare to give way to a younger generation of leaders . \nCiting unnamed British government sources , the Guardian newspaper reported Friday that a senior adviser to Saif Gadhafi was in London for secret talks with British officials . \nThat adviser , Mohammed Ismael , told CNN earlier this week that he would be traveling to London for family reasons . \nCalls placed to his mobile phone by CNN on Friday were not answered . \nAsked about the Guardian report , a British Foreign Office spokesman neither confirmed nor denied it . \n`` We are not going to provide running commentary on our contacts with Libyan officials , '' the spokesman said . \n`` In any contact that we do have , we make it clear that Gadhafi has to go . '' \nIbrahim , the Libyan government spokesman , said he did not know where Ismael was and declined to comment on what he might be doing . \nThe Libyan sources told CNN that for now , Gadhafi remains confident the regime can withstand any challenge from the rebels . \nBad weather for the last two days forced a hiatus in international airstrikes , and in that time , rebel forces retreated from areas they had gained . \nBut in a fresh offensive Friday , Libyan opposition forces led by army units that have defected from Gadhafi 's forces were able to pushed back Gadhafi 's troops , rebel spokesman Shamsiddin Abdulmolah said . \nRebels were fighting with newly refurbished rocket launchers and artillery delivered to the frontlines Thursday night by the army units that switched sides , Abdulmolah said . \nFighting raged at the western gates of the oil town of al-Brega , which has changed hands six times in as many weeks under the dramatically shifting circumstances of Libya 's civil war . \nIn the west , witnesses reported more explosions and fierce urban warfare in the besieged city of Misrata , once the final rebel stronghold in the western part of the country . \nGadhafi 's heavily armed forces continued their pounding Friday amid a series of political setbacks . \nObservers said the surge in firepower reaffirmed the regime 's message : Gadhafi is determined to prevail , and the defections of some of his high-profile allies are making him nervous . \n`` You 're certainly getting evidence that there are a lot of tensions , '' said Anne-Marie Slaughter , a professor of international affairs at Princeton University . \n`` Each person that leaves , that makes it a little scarier for the people that are still remaining , '' she said . \n`` And you may , at some point , get a tipping effect . '' \nOn Thursday , word emerged that Gadhafi 's pick for U.N. ambassador , former Foreign Minister Ali Abdussalam Treki , had defected to Egypt . \nThe day before , the latest foreign minister , Moussa Koussa , fled to London and told the government there that he had resigned . \nU.S. officials claim Gadhafi 's military capabilities have been steadily eroded since the onset of U.N.-sanctioned airstrikes . \nBut the dictator 's forces still outnumber rebels by about 10-to-1 in terms of armor and other ground forces , Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Navy Adm. Mike Mullen told the House Armed Services Committee on Thursday . \nU.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates , also speaking before the House committee , warned that the Libyan rebels still need significant training and assistance . \n`` It 's pretty much a pickup ballgame '' right now , he said . \nU.S. and British officials say no decision has been made about whether to arm the opposition . \nCNN 's Frederik Pleitgen , Ben Wedeman , Nic Robertson , and Reza Sayah contributed to this report . \n"}
{"id": "374", "time": "2011-04-01", "text": "The president 's Libya policy comes under congressional criticism `` Of course this is about regime change , '' a congressman says Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Despite having CIA agents on the ground and Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi 's exit as stated policy , U.S. officials continue to say the NATO-led military mission in Libya is only for its authorized humanitarian purposes . \nThe seeming discrepancy is part of a delicate diplomatic posture by the Obama administration on the complex overseas operation that involves a U.N. Security Council resolution , a multinational military force and the symbolism of presidential statements and actions . \nWith the military mission shifting Thursday to a new phase of full NATO control after initial U.S. leadership , divisions among alliance partners and within Congress became more evident , exacerbated by the administration 's differing military and political goals . \nPresident Barack Obama continues to insist that arming the Libyan rebels remained an option under consideration , while NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen and French Defense Minister Gerard Longuet ruled it out . \nAt House and Senate committee hearings , Republicans grilled Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen on the U.S. role in Libya . \n`` To say this is not about regime change is crazy , '' said Republican Rep. Mike Coffman of Colorado . \n`` Of course this is about regime change . \nWhy not just be honest with the American people ? '' \nObama has said the motivation for launching military action on March 19 was to prevent a massacre of civilians by Libyan military forces descending on the rebel stronghold of Benghazi . \nKucinich : Only Congress can declare war Libya hearings aplenty on the Hill Since then , airstrikes carried out mostly with U.S. planes and missiles have taken out much of Gadhafi 's anti-aircraft capability and destroyed ground forces and supply lines . \nWhile Gadhafi 's forces have pulled back from Benghazi , they reclaimed territory from the rebels in recent days , leading to fears of a prolonged stalemate without stronger military support for the rebels . \nOn Thursday , White House spokesman Jay Carney noted the United States turned over control of the Libya mission to NATO that morning -- 12 days after it began -- to fulfill Obama 's pledge to the nation that U.S. leadership would end within `` days , not weeks . '' \nWhile Carney said the United States and its allies would keep up pressure on Gadhafi 's government , he acknowledged that it was impossible to say when the mission would end . \nRegardless of when , he said , `` the scope of the U.S. involvement will be limited '' and Obama continues to reject any possibility of sending in U.S. ground troops . \nAt the same time , a former counterterrorism official confirmed the existence of a presidential finding that authorizes the Central Intelligence Agency to conduct operations supporting U.S. policy in Libya . \nA presidential finding is a type of secret order authorizing some covert intelligence operations , and a former senior intelligence official said such operations could include `` advising on how to target the adversary , how to use the weapons they have , reconnaissance and counter surveillance . '' \nTop administration officials distinguished between the military mission charged with protecting Libyan civilians and the other non-military efforts -- including sanctions , freezing assets and CIA operations -- aimed at hastening Gadhafi 's departure . \n`` Does the United States have the capacity to unilaterally with military force produce regime change in Libya or another country ? \nWe probably do , '' Carney told reporters . \n`` Is that a desirable action to take when you have your eye on the long game here in terms of Libya 's future , the future ... interests of the United States and the region ? \nNo. '' Obama 's dual-track policy , with the military coalition protecting Libyan civilians while the United States pursues `` as a political , diplomatic and economic policy '' the end of Gadhafi 's rule , is the best fit for the Libya situation , Carney insisted , citing the international backing for the military mission through a U.N. Security Council resolution and Arab League support . \nCritics complained that it is both dishonest and a mistake for the military objective to differ from the policy objective . \nAt a House Armed Services Committee hearing , Rep. Chris Gibson , R-New York , said the mission 's `` military and political goals are not harmonized , '' while Coffman called it `` just the most muddled definition of an operation probably in U.S. military history . '' \nOn the Democratic side , liberal Rep. Dennis Kucinich of Ohio challenged Obama 's legal power to commit U.S. forces to a combat role without congressional authorization . \n`` This is a clear and arrogant violation of our Constitution , '' Kucinich declared on the House floor . \n`` Even a war launched ostensibly for humanitarian reasons is still a war and only Congress can declare a war . '' \nSen. John McCain of Arizona , the unsuccessful Republican presidential nominee in 2008 , warned that pulling U.S. forces back to a supporting role under NATO control undermined the military mission at a key moment . \n`` For the United States to be withdrawing our unique offensive capabilities at this time sends the exact wrong signal both to our coalition partners as well as to the Gadhafi regime , especially to those Libyan officials whom we are trying to compel to break with Gadhafi , '' McCain said at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing . \n`` I need not remind our witnesses that the purpose of using military force is to achieve policy goals , '' McCain told Gates and Mullen . \n`` But in this case , not only are our military means out of alignment with our desired end of Gadhafi leaving power , we are now effectively stopping our strike missions all together without having accomplished our goal . '' \nWhile Obama administration officials have described the continuing U.S. role in the military mission as supportive -- involving refueling , intelligence , surveillance and communications -- Gates said Thursday that U.S. strike aircraft such as A-10 and AC-130s could still be made available to NATO . \nHowever , he added that he believed NATO allies had the capacity to take out Libyan ground forces as necessary under the mission 's mandate of protecting civilian populations . \nAppearing before both the House and Senate panels at separate hearings , Gates said the no-fly zone had been established and now needed to be sustained , but acknowledged `` you could have a situation in which you achieve the military goal but do not achieve the political goal .

{"id": "45", "time": "2011-02-20", "text": "By the CNN Wire Staff Experts and critics say freedom and basic rights in Libya remain widely restricted under Gadhafi 's rule . \nMoammar Gadhafi led a military coup in 1969 that began in Benghazi He now faces his first real popular unrest in 42 years centered in Benghazi Gadhafi has been controversial internationally and has become more a statesman lately His government has restricted communication and freedom , experts and critics say -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Moammar Gadhafi 's first grab at power occurred 42 years ago in the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi , when he led a crew of fellow military officers in taking over key government institutions on his way to usurping the nation 's monarchy . \nEver since , he 's referred to himself as the Leader of the Revolution -- though politically , at least , Libya has appeared to be largely stable , with few threats to Gadhafi 's power . \nBut that all changed this past week , with reports that tens of thousands took to the streets calling for an end to Gadhafi 's rule . \nAnd , once again , that change began in Benghazi . \nCNN has been unable to independently confirm information on the escalating unrest in Libya , the most isolated nation in the region . \nThe government has not responded to repeated requests from CNN for access to the country and maintains tight control over communications . \nStill , phone interviews with witnesses and others on the ground suggest that some of Gadhafi 's strongest opposition has been in Benghazi , where protests began and have escalated . \nSince then , there have been indications that the opposition movement has spread westward toward the capital Tripoli . \nWhy Gadhafi suddenly came under fire after decades of a strong-handed , seemingly stable rule remains a question . \nProtester : ` We want our basic rights ' One obvious factor is that Libya borders Tunisia , where popular unrest last month helped unseat authoritarian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali after more than two decades in power . \nWeeks later , a similar movement contributed to the end of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak 's 30-year rule . \nGadhafi is far from alone now . \nAnti-government protests have popped up all around the Arab world , with pressure growing on powerful leaders in places like Bahrain , Yemen and Algeria . \nBut what makes Libya unique , in large part , is its colorful , controversial and powerful leader . \nGadhafi was a captain in Libya 's army when , on September 1 , 1969 -- which is referred to as Revolution Day in Libya -- he and others launched the coup by assuming control of key institutions in Benghazi . \nThe overthrow was completed in two hours , according to GlobalSecurity.org , an independent provider of security information . \nAt the time , the United States had military aircraft at Wheelus Air Base in Libya . \nAnd Washington did not initially oppose the coup , a 2008 Congressional Research Service report noted . \nGadhafi soon established himself as one of America 's most vocal , and flamboyant , enemies . \nBy 1972 , Gadhafi urged Muslims to fight the United States and Great Britain and vowed support for black revolutionaries in America . \nThe next year , he launched a program `` to destroy imported ideologies , whether they are Eastern or Western , '' a U.S. State Department timeline noted . \nIn 1979 , the U.S. designated Libya as a state sponsor of terrorism . \nThe relationship only worsened in the 1980s , when U.S. military aircraft shot down two Libyan fighter jets . \nLibya 's alleged attacks in Sudan , support for Nicaragua 's Sandanista government and role in the bombing of a West Berlin nightclub only further stoked the ire of the administration of U.S. President Ronald Reagan , who called Gadhafi a `` mad dog . '' \nLibya 's standing took a turn with the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie , Scotland , killing 270 people . \nWorld pressure intensified on Tripoli after Libyan intelligence agents were implicated . \nBy 1993 , Gadhafi told the International Herald Tribune that he was taking a more conciliatory approach to world affairs . \nHe called U.S. President Bill Clinton `` the savior of the new world , '' and decried Islamic militants as `` mad dogs '' and `` terrorists . '' \nClinton continued to keep pressure on Libya , signing a law imposing sanctions on companies that invested more than $ 40 million in that nation 's petroleum industry . \nBy 1999 , Libya finally agreed to transfer the Pan Am 103 suspects for a trial in the Netherlands , leading to their conviction two years later . \nWhile still known for sometimes unconventional comments , Gadhafi appeared to evolve into more of a statesman -- at least internationally . \nIn 2009 , he was elected by member states as head of the African Union . \nThat year , he also addressed the United Nations ' General Assembly for the first time . \nStill , he proved to be more a firebrand than an even-keeled diplomat , delivering a blistering , wide-ranging 96-minute rant . \nHis topics ranged from the U.N. Security Council to the assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy to a one-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians : Isratine . \nGadhafi blamed the U.N. for failing to prevent 65 wars since its founding in 1945 . \nBut he also had kind words for U.S. President Barack Obama : `` We are content and happy if Obama can stay forever as the president of America , '' Gadhafi said . \nWhile Gadhafi seemed to take on a new role internationally , the world had few insights into what was happening inside Libya itself . \nEven as the U.N. , the United States and other nations gradually began to soften their stance on Libya , reports suggested that freedom and basic rights remained widely restricted under Gadhafi . \n`` He has n't changed , '' said Fouad Ajami , a professor at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies . \n`` This is a monster . \nAnd the Libyan people are suffering from this . '' \nThe government maintained a tight control over its communications , clamping down on news accounts critical of Gadhafi and his colleagues . \nIt also restricted outside media access , including denying repeated requests from CNN to enter the country this month . \nOn Friday night , Libyan authorities shut down the nation 's access to the internet , the U.S.-based tech firm Arbor Networks reported . \nWhile there have been indications of spotty Web coverage since , Libya sent out a text message warning about the `` inappropriate use of telecommunications services . '' \nInternal political dissent was largely and often violently squashed . \nMoftah , an anti-government protester who did not give his full name for security reasons , said Gadhafi `` always plays on fear '' -- relying on a broad network of intelligence agents , secret police and others . \n`` He makes you afraid of your family , of your friends , '' Moftah told CNN . \n`` He will tell you that his secret police are everywhere . '' \nAnd yet , despite the odds , people have still risen up this month against Gadhafi . \nFor years , Libya profited greatly from its vast oil reserves . \nOne of Gadhafi 's first orders of business after taking over was to assume control of properties and other interests of international petroleum companies . \nStill , even the great wealth of oil could n't change the fact that Libya has suffered in the recent global economic downturn . \nAs in much of the Arab world , youth unemployment is high in Libya -- and most of the population has never known a leader other than Gadhafi . \nAnd the fact it began in Benghazi , despite the Libyan leader 's early history , is not a surprise , said Dirk Vandewalle , an associate professor at Dartmouth and author of `` A History of Modern Libya . '' \nHe noted that the coastal city has traditionally been seen as somewhat disloyal to Gadhafi 's regime . \nWhether the Libyan demonstrators can follow the leads of their Arab colleagues in Tunisia and Egypt remains to be seen . \nIf they do , they will have to overcome a cult of personality -- much like prevailed in those countries -- without having any fallback as far as political institutions or legislation to build off should they succeed . \nUnlike Egypt , Libya has no constitution , established institutions or any kind of mechanisms in place to support a new nation . \nThe nation and its leader are one . \n`` In Libya , '' Vandewalle said , `` there is nothing beyond Gadhafi and his close circle .

They are merciless and will do anything in the name of religion . \nThe legal framework of Iran is also being ignored so they can accuse you of anything and perhaps kill you . \nAre Mir Hossein Moussavi and Mehdi Karrubi the leaders of Iran 's opposition movement ? \nNastaran : To me they are not . \nTo me they became leaders through people 's anger and dissatisfaction with the regime . \nHowever , I believe that every movement and uprising requires a leader and at this point in time there is no one better than them . \nThe regime will not step back and will kill as many people as it deems necessary to stay in power . \nI do not accept them as leaders because I generally disagree with their ideologies . \nFurther , I think they are not the right leaders for a large portion of our population . \nMany Iranians will always believe that these guys are part of the system and will refuse to support them . \nMany Iranians will not accept a religious figure , some one with a turban on their head as a leader , given their experience in the past 30 years . \nWhat does Iran 's opposition movement want from America right now ? \nWhat do you want President Obama to do ? \nNastaran : Direct interference -LRB- from -RRB- America is not helpful . \nIranians are prone to conspiracy theories and history has proven that American interference is not to our benefit . \n28 Mordad is a prime example -LRB- the 1953 U.S.-backed coup that overthrew Iran 's democratically elected government -RRB- . \nAs a result , the masses tend to not want to follow any movement that is initiated or assisted by Americans . \nTheir help should be indirect , but their help can be valuable . \nAn example would be creating infrastructure for Iranians to more freely communicate , have access to information and spread the information . \nAdditionally , appropriate sanctions can be useful also . \nHowever , they should be the type of sanctions that the regime would n't be able to blame for the people 's unhappiness and poverty . \nI think -LRB- that -RRB- until people really feel hungry and see that different economic and foreign policies will mean more comfortable lives , they wo n't join any kind of a movement . \nIntelligent sanctions can result in the latter . \n"}

'' \nLate Friday , a witness said more people were still streaming into the already crowded plaza , with some erecting tents , apparently planning to spend the night . \nThere was no sign in the square of police or military forces except for the presence of three tanks , which were not moving , he said . \nAnother source said that he saw three Libyan army tanks in the square and that young demonstrators were engaging the tank crews in conversation . \nHe said government forces were not visible in or around Benghazi . \nHe added that he visited Al-Jala hospital and that it was `` full of dead and wounded .

'' \nUnlike some other world leaders , Zuma has not called for the longtime Libyan leader to step down . \nNeither has Zuma 's African National Congress party nor the African Union , which he was representing and which Gadhafi once led . \nIn fact , the AU has criticized the NATO airstrikes . \nIn April , Zuma led an AU delegation to Tripoli , where hopes were raised briefly when it was announced that Gadhafi had agreed , in principle , to the African Union 's `` road map '' proposal for peace . \nBut Gadhafi continued his attacks and the Libyan opposition rejected the proposal because it did not meet its demand that he give up the power he has held for 42 years . \nA government official said Libyan Prime Minister Al-Baghdadi Ali al-Mahmudi also attended Monday 's meeting . \nBaghdadi greeted Zuma upon his arrival at the airport , where dozens of Gadhafi supporters carried posters , some of which said , `` May the leader be victorious '' and `` Thanks for great Africa . '' \nThe African Union has helped mediate peace talks before , including ones in Kenya and Zimbabwe that left the ruling powers in control . \nIt was not clear whether Zuma used the opportunity to press Gadhafi for information on the whereabouts of South African freelance photographer Anton Hammerl . \nHammerl has been missing in Libya since April and is believed dead . \nSouth Africa has said it got assurances from Libya that the journalist was alive . \nBut a Libyan government spokesman has said his whereabouts were unknown . \n`` We never had him with us at any stage , '' spokesman Musa Ibrahim has said . \nThe meeting came as Gadhafi 's grip on power appeared to continue to loosen . \nEight generals from his army have defected to Italy , the Italian Foreign Ministry told CNN Monday . \nThe generals were accompanied by more than 100 Libyan soldiers , a senior Italian official with firsthand knowledge of , and responsibility for , the operation said . \nThe Libyans crossed their country 's border into Tunisia , where they were met by Italian intelligence agents , the official said . \nItaly announced Monday that it will open a consulate Tuesday in the rebel-held eastern city of Benghazi . \nAlso Monday , the first locally based television station to operate in Libya since the start of the revolution was to begin broadcasting from the rebel stronghold of Benghazi . \nThe station was founded by Momammed Nabus , who later was one of five journalists killed in the conflict . \n`` Gadhafi forces assassinated him for highlighting to the rest of the world the atrocities committed by the Gadhafi regime , '' said Zuheir Al-Barasi , who was to open the station 's broadcast from the city 's courthouse . \nIn recent weeks , Gadhafi has been seen in public only rarely as NATO has stepped up attacks against his sprawling Bab el-Azizia compound . \nNATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said Monday that Gadhafi 's `` reign of terror is coming to an end . '' \n`` He is increasingly isolated at home and abroad , '' Rasmussen said during a speech in Bulgaria . \n`` Even those closest to him are departing , defecting or deserting . '' \nRasmussen also said NATO has made `` significant progress '' in its Libya operation . \nNATO said Monday it has conducted 3,385 strike sorties in Libya since March . \n`` We have seriously degraded Gadhafi 's ability to kill his own people , '' Rasmussen said in his speech . \n`` We have prevented more massacres in Misrata and elsewhere across the country , and we are saving lives every day . '' \nThe NATO-led bombing campaign began in March after the U.N. Security Council authorized the use of any means necessary -- short of occupation -- to protect civilians from attacks by Gadhafi 's forces . \nOn Sunday , Libyan opposition forces continued to fend off attacks near the rebel-held port city of Misrata . \nBut rebel leader Mustafa Abdul Jalil said over the weekend that the opposition movement is running out of money even as it has achieved key victories militarily and diplomatically . \n`` We are going through a financial crisis , '' said Jalil , chairman of the Benghazi-based National Transitional Council . \nIn a speech in Geneva , Switzerland , the United Nations ' top human rights official noted Monday `` the brutality and magnitude of measures '' taken by the Libyan government . \nThe government 's actions have been `` shocking , '' United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said , criticizing the `` outright disregard for basic human rights .

'' \n`` Let 's push it farther , '' a male voice says off-camera . \n`` No , no , that 's enough ! '' \nEventually , one of the men puts his sock-covered foot on her face . \nIn Arab culture , that is considered a major insult . \nBut in this case , it pales in comparison to what the victim is already enduring . \nArabic speakers who listened to the video at CNN 's request say the voices have Tripoli accents . \nThere is no date on the video and the men in it are not wearing military uniforms . \nCNN has been unable to verify the video 's authenticity , when it was shot , or by whom . \nThe person who gave it to CNN asked not to be identified for fear of being punished by Libya 's conservative society . \nThe Gadhafi government did not respond to CNN requests for comment on the allegations of abuse . \nBut officials have said in response to similar accusations in the past that the government has not been able to verify the claims and would `` welcome '' a fact-finding mission . \nWe were able to confirm that rape was used as a weapon of war because it was systematic . \nAn opposition spokesman says the video illustrates a pattern of abuse . \n`` We were able to confirm that rape was used as a weapon of war , because it was systematic , '' rebel spokesman Abdullah al-Kabeir said . \nThe rebels have many videos showing other types of torture , and a few depict rape , he said . \nHe did not know exactly how many videos there were showing abuse . \nOne of the most famous faces of Libya 's revolution , Eman al-Obeidy , dramatically claimed in March she had been gang-raped by pro-Gadhafi forces . \nShe has since fled the country . \nA Libyan psychologist who has conducted an investigation of her own says al-Obeidy 's case is not unique . \nSiham Sergewa says she has evidence of hundreds of cases of rape by pro-Gadhafi troops . \nShe began her investigation after receiving phone calls from women who said they had been sexually assaulted . \nHer survey of 50,000 people in refugee camps turned up 259 people who said they had been raped , she said last month . \n`` They tie up my husband , they rape me in front of my husband and then they kill my husband , '' Sergewa said one woman told her . \n`` I 'm a psychologist and I 've seen lots of things , really . \nBut sometimes after I leave some of these families I just sit in my car and cry because it 's really so painful , '' she said . \nShe has compiled a number of distressing images that she says demonstrate the abuse of alleged victims . \nOne appears to show a cigarette burn on a woman 's breast , another a faded bite mark , while several others show the deep purple hue of nasty bruises . \nSergewa shared her research , complete with pictures and recordings , with the International Criminal Court at The Hague , Netherlands , where prosecutors are investigating accusations that the Gadhafi regime has used rape as a tool of war . \n`` The victims are starting to come out , '' the court 's chief prosecutor , Luis Moreno-Ocampo , told CNN Thursday . \n`` But in our court the crimes are massive and the crimes we are charging Gadhafi with are crimes against humanity , meaning a widespread and systematic attack -- in this case through rapes -- so we do n't need to prove one case ; we need to prove massive numbers of cases . \n`` In this case , the evidence can be different . \nIt could be soldiers who were given instructions on how to do it . \nThe evidence could be doctors or psychologists who have spoken to the victims . \nThat 's the kind of evidence we are collecting . '' \nThe court is still in the evidence-collecting stage , he said . \nFor the video to be part of that evidence , its authenticity would have to be certified , he said . \n`` These are interesting pieces , but it is n't the only way to put forward the case . \nFor instance , we have some information of people saying that Gadhafi himself was giving instructions . \nSo if we can confirm this evidence , that will be enough to present this type of case as a crime against humanity -- as a widespread campaign of rapes . '' \nMoreno-Ocampo said he was hoping the judge would soon issue an arrest warrant for Gadhafi . \n`` And then the challenge will be to arrest him , because arresting him will be the end to these crimes , '' he said . \nRebel spokesman al-Kabeir , however , said some of the evidence of war crimes that prosecutors want to present in court has been destroyed by a rebel leader . \n`` There was a commander here at the eastern front in Misrata named Mohamed al-Halboos ; he ordered all the -LRB- rebel -RRB- fighters to give him all the rape videos they find on Gadhafi soldiers ' cell phones . \nI heard that he used to destroy every rape video he got , '' al-Kabeir said . \nAsked why potential evidence of war crimes being carried out by pro-Gadhafi forces would be destroyed by rebel forces , he cited the heavy stigma that Libyan culture attaches to the victims of such crimes . \n`` Aside from being a heinous crime , rape is perceived here in our culture as damaging not only for the girl , but also the whole family , '' he said . \nIn fact , he added , rape is such a taboo here that some victims ' families would rather erase potential evidence than risk living with the shame . \nIn Washington , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the United States was `` deeply concerned '' over the reports of wide-scale rape in Libya . \n`` A thorough investigation of this matter is needed to bring perpetrators to justice , '' she said in a statement . \n`` Gadhafi 's security forces and other groups in the region are trying to divide the people by using violence against women and rape as tools of war , and the United States condemns this in the strongest possible terms .

{"id": "303", "time": "2011-06-17", "text": "By Stephan Richter -- Special to CNN Seemingly all the major U.S. newspapers , including the New York Times and Washington Post , are editorializing harshly that NATO -LRB- read : Europe -RRB- shows itself a complete failure in Libya . \nIt acts too slowly , with too little force and proves shamefully dependent on U.S. firepower . \nFollowing on the heels of U.S. Secretary of Defense Bob Gates ' stern warning about the future of NATO , such displays of what increasingly seems like self-righteous indignation were to be expected . \nTo be sure , the European response to Libya leaves much to be desired . \nAnd yet , I wonder : Imagine the Europeans had brought to bear all the firepower imaginable and had done so rapidly . \nWould the world be better off ? \nThe answer is not a matter of conjecture and speculation , but of hard evidence because there is a relevant precedent : Iraq . \nThe key question that needs to be asked is : Just what has shock and awe brought us in Iraq ? \nOr in Afghanistan for that matter ? \nThe evidence is that even the best-resourced military the world has ever known , rife with its impressive hell-from-the-sky and boots-on-the-ground skills , has not succeeded where it moved fast , in Iraq . \nHundreds of billions of dollars and a decade later , the United States is likely to have very little to show for its interventions , especially considering the human lives lost and financial treasures expended in those two large-scale missions . \nThe key question is this : What does all that firepower really yield ? \nTemporary , mucho macho self-satisfaction ? \nA live-action training ground for toys for boys ? \nIn the end , what has been forgotten amid all the na ve and , yes , boyish , fascination with state-of-the-art military equipment is that all those conflicts require a political solution . \nAnd the prospects for that definitely do not get advanced much by rapid , `` decisive '' military action . \nQuite the opposite : The action may come too fast , exceeding ground commanders ' ability to steer the process of political change . \nRemember L. Paul Bremer , that dapper Timberland `` boot guy '' who quickly determined , in his infinite wisdom and really quite idiotically , to dissolve the Baath Party instead of cleansing it and preserving a semblance of a non-Shiite , non-Iranian-steered power structure in Iraq ? \nThose are exactly the kinds of mistakes that are made if things go too well and too swiftly militarily . \nSo the bigger question , with the U.S. media rush toward rapid action in Libya , is : Who 's kidding whom ? \nThe Europeans are far from perfect and they know it . \nBut it is important to recognize that their scarce-resources-induced go-slow approach actually helps settle the political battlefield in Libya . \nAssume the NATO partners and related parties had succeeded wildly and toppled Gadhafi in next to no time . \nThe problem has been all along that , when it comes to the opposition , we don t know whom we are dealing with , who had the skills to lead and we are still grappling with these questions . \nSo what time has really been lost ? \nThe `` delay '' has only prevented us from making yet another rash , L. Paul Bremer-like pact with yet another potential devil . \nAs things stand , Libya 's post-Gadhafi regime , in a way , is slowly shaking itself out by virtue of allowing plenty of members of the previous elite to disassociate themselves from the despot . \nAs a result , a gradual internal self-cleansing process is taking place , which can only be said to help the transition and lay the groundwork more deliberately for the subsequent transformation , which is going to be difficult enough . \nEven in Poland , perhaps the biggest success story in terms of self-liberation , it took eight long years , from the imposition of martial law under General Wojciech Jaruzelski in December 1981 to October 1989 , when Solidarnosc had finally won the upper hand . \nGiven that , how could Libya , fraught with tribal conflicts as it is , realistically expect to have a transition lasting but a few weeks ? \nIn closing , it 's worthwhile to reflect on NATO : NATO , or so it seems , increasingly only brings out the worst in the transatlantic partners these days , even when it seems they are finally pulling on the same rope and in the same direction . \nI remember attending a dinner in Washingtonat a very pro-NATO organization and some people around the table , ardent transatlanticists , spewed with disgust over the Europeans ' actions in Libya . \n`` Wimps , `` incompetents , '' `` cowards '' were probably among the nicer words I heard . \nMy own view , that the NATO intervention actually gave the previously rather ephemeral `` responsibility to protect '' some real meaning -LRB- and also created a precedent -RRB- , did n't cut it . \nNeither did my point that , in comparison to the eternal hesitation in the 1990s in dealing with the Balkans , this ought to be considered progress . \nIf you engage , I was told , bring maximum force . \nSince the Europeans , as a matter of political and public will , as well as of finances , were not only unable to do it now , but really will be unable to do so at any time in the future , why uphold the charade that is NATO ? \nAnd there you have it : On the rare occasions when one might surmise a happy meeting of the minds between those who are usually keen to pull the trigger and those who are hesitant to do so , it 's still not good enough . \nThat is indeed a wide ocean to bridge , one that will perhaps prove unbridgeable . \nThe views expressed in this article are solely those of Stephan Richter . \nTo read more of The Globalist s features on Libya , click here . \nWe can clearly see that the People of America and the European Union Need to pay for the Services of Liars Anonymous for many of their Journalists , because this is VITAL for their own safety , and for the safety of their Neighbours , their Friends , and their Relatives . \nWe can clearly see that the People of America and the European Union Need to pay for the Services of Murderers Anonymous for many of their Politicians , because this is VITAL for their own safety , and for the safety of their Neighbours , their Friends , and their Relatives . \nThe American Constitution says that America Needs more than one Hardened Liar and Uncontrollable Murderer in Politics , because People might start seeing the American President as a Puppet of Bankers and Plutocrats . \nThe South Africans have a Proven way to Protect Civilians , and that was a Truth and Reconciliation Commission , and the People of America and the European Union Need to Persistently DEMAND a Truth and Reconciliation Commission VERY SOON , and do this before it is too late for themselves , for their Neighbours , for their Friends , and for their Relatives . \nThe People who Confess at the Truth and Reconciliation Tribunal will be both past and serving American and European Union Politicians and their Main Stream Media People , along with the Lying Journalists who will admit to the World what they Truly Are . \nThese American and European Union Politicians Need to Confess that they have Uncontrollable Urges to Murder People , and that they love to masturbate when they see People suffering , because it gives them such good orgasms , and this is why they are Professional Liars and Excuse Makers in order to cover up their Despicable Personalities , and their Evil Crimes against Humanity . \nThe People of America and the European Union NEED to hear all the Dirt and Filth of these People during the American and European Union Truth and Reconciliation Commission Process . \nIf the People of America and the European Union do not hold this Truth and Reconciliation Process , but Cowardly and Foolishly Sweep Any of It Under the Carpet , then the Wise ones among the People know what will happen to their Neighbours , their Friends , and their Families . \nElections in America and the European Union cost lots of Money , and the Bankers , the Plutocrats , and the Corporations only give the American and European Union Politicians Money to get elected or re-elected in the first place if they can blackmail them to be their Puppets . \nThe Unelected Western Bankers , Plutocrats , and Corporations have the Firm Guarantee of the Total Compliance of these Corrupt Politicians at the expense of even any semblance of Democracy for the Voters in America and in the European Union . \nMany People are convinced that most of the American and European Union Politicians are Puppets , and this was Guaranteed by them Lusting for the Dirty Money of the Bankers , the Plutocrats , and the Corporations . \nTo receive this Dirty Money , these Corrupt Politicians Secretly Agreed to be Filmed in acts of Bestiality or Paedophilia to ensure Total Obedience to the Schemes and Whims of the Behind the Scenes White Ruling Euro-American Plutocratic Elites . \nThe Truth and Reconciliation Commission Process will not charge any of those who Willingly Confess , and People should understand that this includes even those who voluntarily were Filmed in acts of Paedophilia to gain the Dirty Campaign Finance from the Bankers , the Plutocrats , and the Corporations . \nA Copy of this Document should be placed in every Letterbox in America and the European Union in order to delay the eventual and inevitable Military Dictatorships in these Countries . \nThese American and European Union Politicians and Journalists and their Puppets Around the World will be asked if they have been Secretly Vaccinated with Genetically Engineered Lethal Viruses that would kill 99 % of Earth s Population within a Week of it being Released into the Environment from American Military Bases Around the World . \nJune 17 , 2011 at 6:50 am | Reply I can summarize my reply to your post with two words . \nJune 18 , 2011 at 4:32 pm | Reply Are you one of those `` neo-progressives '' who thinks a cabal of bankers is running the globe ?

'' \nIronically the anti-government forces are training inside a military camp that was occupied by Gadhafi forces until a couple of months ago . \nGovernment troops tried to destroy the place when Benghazi fell to the rebels . \nThe assistant commander of the rebel 's 17th of February Martyrs Brigade said the local people used to be terrified of this camp . \nLibya humanitarian mission turns chaotic `` This camp was the Revolutionary Committees camp . \nThey were the most brutal arm of Gadhafi forces . \nPeople were being tortured here , they were being imprisoned here , '' said Mustafa Saguzli . \nNow the rebels hoping to topple the Gadhafi regime are using the burned out grounds . \nMore than two months since the uprising began , rebel leaders say they are able to train their fighters longer and better now . \n`` When the war started it was almost like a picnic . \nAnybody who wants to fight can go by himself , carry an arm and go by himself , '' said Saguzli . \n`` In the very beginning we had short courses of two weeks because the battle was moving so fast and we needed to have as many fighters as possible . \nNow it is taking one month to a month and a half . '' \nSaguzli has no military experience . \nHe is a computer engineer who owned a business . \nNow he 's using his programming skills to program young minds for victory in the battlefield . \nThe fighters are even specializing . \nThere is a section of the camp dedicated to refurbishing weapons -- a skill that is turning out to be as vital as the ability to use the weapons . \nThe yard is filled with broken down arms , most of which are from the 1940s . \nThey clink away on the bits and pieces they have and then test the weapons . \nThey often do n't work the first time around and the process starts all over again . \nEvery now and then the tired spoils of war show up at the camp via a flat-bed truck . \nThis time it 's armed jeeps that the commanders say were captured from Gadhafi 's troops in Ajadabiya . \nThey are all in poor shape and must be repaired . \nThe rebels say they have received a few new arms from the Gulf state of Qatar but have long been calling for NATO to give more . \n`` Libya could be your gate to a new way of dealing with the Muslim world , '' said Saguzli . \n`` I have to be honest with you when the west supported Mubarak or Gadhafi or Assad -LRB- the long time heads of state of Egypt , Libya , and Syria -RRB- or any of these tyrants who were killing us , the west was our enemy . \n`` And now the west , America and Europe is supporting us . \nNow they are our allies and friends . '' \nVolunteers keep showing up at the camp to go through the most basic training regime you can imagine . \nThey are using still bars , rope , and the few guns they have to get the recruits ready to fight as best they can . \n61-year-old Fendi Faraj came out of retirement from the military to help the recruits with their fight against the very forces he used to serve . \n`` What I witnessed , as far as the army attacking the people , can not allow an honest soldier to remain in the service . '' \nFaraj has vowed to teach the young to fight against the regime knowing first hand there is a massive imbalance in training and weaponry . \n`` There is no comparison , '' he said . \n`` It 's like the difference between the sky and the earth . \nBut the youth want to live free and if they die , they want to die a martyr . '' \nIt is a choice these volunteers make willingly . \nSome have even warned their commanders if they do n't get arms soon they will go to the front lines without them . \n"}

Mike Bracken , a NATO spokesman . \nA Pentagon source told CNN that the Fire Scout belonged to the U.S. Navy . \nLibyan state television reported that an `` Apache helicopter was downed in the area of Majr in Zliten , '' claiming it was the fifth NATO aircraft to be downed . \nAn Apache is a manned attack helicopter . \nBracken denied that NATO had lost any attack helicopters during the alliance 's mission in Libya . \nGallery : Rockets bring misery to Misrata The resolution , introduced by John Kerry , D-Massachusetts , and John McCain , R-Arizona , authorizes the commitment of U.S. forces for one year while stressing the lack of support for any use of American ground troops . \nLibya state TV on Tuesday reported a NATO strike southwest of Tripoli in Nalut city , resulting in `` material and human damages . '' \nLibyan forces were also continuing their attacks . \nAt 6 p.m. in Misrata , a CNN employee saw three Grad-type rockets strike the center of the city , slightly wounding a 13-year-old boy in front of a bicycle shop . \nIn Dafniya , between Tripoli and Misrata , five rebels were killed and 31 were wounded in clashes along the frontline , according to officials at Misrata 's Al-Hikma Hospital . \nThe Libyan war erupted from anti-government protests in February . \nFollowing a United Nations mandate to protect civilians , NATO began bombing military targets in March . \nHowever , strongman Moammar Gadhafi still maintains control in Tripoli . \nTuesday , Human Rights Watch said that Libyan government forces had planted more than 150 landmines in at least one location in the Nafusa Mountains in western Libya . \nThe global monitoring group visited the site , inspected mines that had been removed , and interviewed the rebel fighters who removed them . \n`` These antipersonnel landmines pose a huge threat to civilians , '' said Steve Goose , arms director at Human Rights Watch . \n`` More than 150 countries have banned landmines , but Libya continues to defy this global trend .

'' \nLibya 's government said Sunday that nine people were killed and six wounded when a NATO strike hit a residential neighborhood in the Libyan capital . \nNATO said Sunday that a military missile site was the intended target . \n`` However , it appears that one weapon did not strike the intended target and that there may have been a weapons system failure , '' a NATO statement said . \nOn Saturday , NATO expressed regret after its aircraft mistakenly struck vehicles aligned with the Libyan opposition in the key and hotly contested eastern oil city of al-Brega . \nMeanwhile , Libyan opposition leader Mahmoud Jibril arrived Tuesday in Beijing for meetings with Chinese officials , state media reported . \nJibril , chairman of the executive board of the opposition Transitional National Council , will be in China for two days , according to Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei . \n`` China 's major task is to promote peace and encourage talks , '' Hong said . \n`` China has followed closely the development of the situation in Libya , and calls for the political resolution of the Libyan crisis . '' \nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs called the rebels `` an important political power of Libya . '' \nThat recognition comes a month after Jibril said that China bolstered the opposition movement 's stature by purchasing a shipment of oil from the opposition group for $ 160 million . \n`` We have maintained contacts with both sides of Libya , and urge them to take actions that are conducive to the interest of the people of the country , '' Hong said . \n`` We believe that the future of Libya should be determined by the Libyan people themselves , and China will respect the independent choice of the Libyan people .

Kerry and McCain introduce a resolution offering support for the Libya mission Critics say the White House has n't complied with the War Powers Resolution Pressure is mounting in the House to cut U.S. support for the NATO-led mission Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Two influential U.S. senators introduced a resolution Tuesday expressing support for limited American involvement in the NATO-led military campaign in Libya -- part of an effort to counter rising pressure in the House of Representatives to withdraw backing for the mission . \nMeanwhile , House Speaker John Boehner proposed two resolutions on the Libya mission that could come up for votes on Thursday . \nOne would be the same as the Senate resolution introduced Tuesday , and the other would limit U.S. involvement in the mission to a noncombat role while allowing many of the same functions being performed now by U.S. forces to continue . \nThe House proposal seeking a noncombat role reflects frustration in Congress over what Boehner and others call President Barack Obama 's failure to get necessary congressional authorization under the War Powers Resolution for engaging U.S. forces in the Libya military campaign . \n`` If the Commander-in-Chief believes that intervention in Libya is important for our national security , he has a responsibility to make a case for it -- clearly and publicly -- and seek authorization , '' Boehner said in a statement announcing the two proposed House resolutions . \n`` In the three months since military action in Libya began , none of this has occurred . \nThe American people deserve to have their voice heard in this debate , and Congress has a responsibility to hold the White House accountable . '' \nThe Senate resolution , introduced by Massachusetts Democrat John Kerry and Arizona Republican John McCain , authorizes the commitment of U.S. forces for one year while stressing the lack of support for any use of American ground troops . \nCNN tours NATO airstrike site `` I believe the president did the right thing by intervening to stop a looming humanitarian disaster , '' McCain said . \n`` I believe we will find a strong , bipartisan majority that is in favor of authorizing our current military operations in Libya and seeing this mission through to success . '' \nKerry added , `` By supporting this resolution , we tell Arabs young and old that the United States is willing to make tough decisions and spend our tax dollars to help ensure your freedom . '' \nThe allied military effort , which already has formal U.N. support , was launched to protect Libyan civilians from violence stemming from a crackdown launched by the North African country 's longtime ruler , Moammar Gadhafi . \nWestern leaders have made clear , however , that they believe the mission can not be successfully completed without Gadhafi 's ouster . \nThe Obama administration has already promised not to use U.S. ground troops , but bipartisan congressional opposition to the military campaign has been mounting . \nAn unusual coalition has formed between traditionally anti-war Democrats and conservative Republicans worried about the cost of the conflict and skeptical of its national security importance . \nOne of the House resolutions under consideration will be the same as the McCain-Kerry proposal that supports the current limited U.S. role in the mission , Boehner , R-Ohio , said in a statement . \nA House GOP leadership source said the measure is expected to be defeated . \nThe second House resolution would remove U.S. forces from hostilities in Libya , except for those engaged in nonhostile actions including search and rescue ; aerial refueling ; operational planning ; intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance ; and noncombat missions . \nWhile the resolution would be nonbinding , its approval by the House would signal strong opposition to Obama 's decision to commit U.S. forces without seeking authorization from Congress . \nA House leadership aide said the second resolution is aimed at U.S. military drones and any other combat role by U.S. forces in Libya , and is likely to pass in the Republican-controlled chamber . \nHouse Republicans will meet Wednesday to further discuss the issue , and GOP leaders were not ruling out possible changes or additions to the resolutions . \nCritics contend the 1973 War Powers Resolution gives the president 60 days to get congressional approval for sending U.S. forces to war , followed by a 30-day extension to end hostilities . \nThe combined 90-day period ended Sunday . \nSupport for the war has also been shaken by evidence presented by Gadhafi 's government of several noncombatant deaths caused by recent NATO airstrikes . \nNATO officials admitted over the weekend that aircraft from countries in the alliance had mistakenly struck vehicles aligned with the Libyan opposition . \nThe White House argues the president did n't need congressional authorization because U.S. forces are playing only a supporting role in Libya and have n't engaged in what the law defines as hostilities . \nObama , however , personally overruled contrary legal opinions put forward by both the Pentagon and the Justice Department 's Office of Legal Counsel , according to a Saturday report in The New York Times . \nIn the Senate , Majority Leader Harry Reid , D-Nevada , and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Kentucky , have resisted holding a vote on the war because of divisions within their respective caucuses . \nReid said Tuesday that there is bipartisan support for the McCain-Kerry resolution in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , but that he was still in discussion with the two sponsors on when to bring the measure from the panel to the Senate floor . \nHe indicated it could be brought to the floor as early as this week . \nMcConnell , meanwhile , told reporters that `` we all anticipate that there will be some kind of Libya debate in the Senate in the near future . '' \nMcCain has expressed anger that the White House did n't push for an earlier congressional vote on the war . \nThe senator , who ran against Obama in 2008 , contends a resolution of support would have passed easily when NATO first intervened . \n`` The administration 's disregard for the elected representatives of the American people on this matter has been troubling and counterproductive , '' McCain said Tuesday . \n`` The unfortunate result of this failure of leadership is plain to see in the full-scale revolt ... that is occurring in the House of Representatives . '' \nThe House is also planning to take up the 2012 defense spending bill later this week , and liberal Rep. Dennis Kucinich , D-Ohio , intends to propose an amendment cutting off funding for the mission . \nHowever , that amendment is likely to only come up next month after the House returns from its Fourth of July recess . \nTo prevent a similar resolution from Kucinich from passing earlier , Boehner pushed through a resolution giving the president two weeks to send Congress information justifying the U.S. strategy in Libya . \nObama responded with a 32-page report arguing in part that he has not violated the War Powers Resolution . \nEven if the Republican-controlled House passes measures intended to limit funding for the Libya mission , it is unlikely the Senate would do the same . \n`` The president 's done a lousy job of communicating and managing our involvement in Libya , but I will be no part of an effort to defund Libya or to try to cut off our efforts to bring Gadhafi down , '' conservative Sen. Lindsey Graham , R-South Carolina , told NBC 's `` Meet the Press '' on Sunday . \nObama `` needs to step up his game with Libya , but Congress should sort of shut up and not empower Gadhafi , '' Graham argued . \nIn March , the Senate unanimously passed a nonbinding resolution supporting the no-fly zone over Libya . \nSome Republicans , however , have now expressed opposition to that effort , citing growing concerns about its cost . \nIn its report on the mission , the administration said the cost of military and humanitarian operations through June 3 was about $ 800 million . \nIt estimated the total cost through September 30 would be $ 1.1 billion . \nQuestions about the war 's financial and other costs have also been raised in the United Kingdom , which has played a leading role in the NATO effort . \nBritish Prime Minister David Cameron insists that Britain 's military involvement in the North African country can continue `` as long as we need .

Security Council approved a resolution authorizing any means necessary to protect civilians demanding the end of Gadhafi 's nearly 42-year rule . \nThe alliance said it targeted a `` command-and-control building '' in Tripoli on Saturday , as well as hit seven ammunition depots around the capital . \nAccording to a NATO military official , the airstrike that Libya says killed Gadhafi 's son involved four precision-targeted bombs , one of which failed to detonate . \nThe official , who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter , said the alliance was certain the target was a command-and-control facility and said the building hit , although above ground , had reinforced portions . \nThe official said NATO had `` no evidence '' that Gadhafi 's relatives had been killed . \nA photograph of the site showed the unexploded bomb , a 2,000-pound weapon designed to penetrate reinforced concrete , but NATO would not confirm what other types of ordnance may have been dropped . \nNor would it disclose which nation 's aircraft carried out the strike , or what type of aircraft were used . \nLibyan officials attacked the U.S. Embassy compound in Tripoli Sunday , as well as the British , French and Italian missions , according to a senior U.S. official in Washington . \nAll four NATO nations are taking part in the airstrikes . \nMark Toner , a U.S. State Department spokesman , said he had seen reports of violence against the diplomatic facilities and that if true , `` we condemn these attacks in the strongest possible terms . '' \nItalian officials told CNN that the embassy of Qatar , a Gulf Arab state that supports the campaign and is supplying arms to the rebels , was also targeted . \nThe senior U.S. official said Turkey , the protecting power for U.S. interests in Libya , is trying to keep an eye on the American compound -- but `` there is n't much they can do when you have an organized mob , as this appeared to be . '' \nIn London , British Foreign Secretary William Hague expelled Libya 's ambassador to the United Kingdom after the attacks . \nHague said the Tripoli government is breaching its international obligation to protect diplomatic missions by allowing the vandalism . \n`` The attacks against diplomatic missions will not weaken our resolve to protect the civilian population in Libya , '' Hague said . \nIbrahim told CNN the attacks happened because `` the people were upset '' and that Libyan security forces stopped the attacks and prevented the embassies from being destroyed . \n`` There are embassies that have not been touched , '' he said . \nLibyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim said later the government deeply regrets the looting and violence at the embassies . \nAngry crowds simply overwhelmed police , he said . \nIn addition , 12 U.N. international staffers left Tripoli because of the unrest and are in Tunisia , the world body said Sunday . \nSpokeswoman Eri Kaneko said the United Nations would not identify the staffers or their agencies for safety reasons . \nU.N. national staffers are still in the country and international staffers remain in Benghazi . \nCNN 's Frederik Pleitgen , Richard Roth , Barbara Starr , Elise Labott , Richard Allen Greene and Holly Yan contributed to this report . \n"}

'' \nHe said the 29-year-old son killed was a student in Germany , the sixth of eight children . \nThe strike destroyed the house in Tripoli , leaving a massive crater . \nSaif al-Arab Gadhafi is one of two sons of the Libyan leader whose names begin with Saif . \nAnother son -- Saif al-Islam Gadhafi -- had previously touted reform , but has emerged as one of his father 's most visible defenders in recent months . \nThe commander of the NATO operation , Lt. Gen. Charles Bouchard , said NATO was aware of `` unconfirmed media reports '' that members of Gadhafi 's family had been killed in an airstrike . \n`` We regret all loss of life , especially the innocent civilians being harmed as a result of this ongoing conflict , '' said Bouchard , a Canadian air force general . \nBut he said all targets `` are military in nature and have been clearly linked to the Gadhafi regime 's systemic attacks on the Libyan population ... We do not target individuals . '' \nBut Russia , which has criticized the allied campaign , said it had `` serious doubts '' about NATO 's assertion that it is not targeting Gadhafi and his family . \n`` The disproportional use of force , all the more so , beyond the mandate of U.N. Security Council Resolution No. 1973 , which in no way stipulates the replacement of the Libyan leadership , is leading to harmful consequences and the death of civilians , '' the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement carried by the official RIA Novosti news agency . \n`` We are again calling for strict compliance with the provisions of the decisions made by the international community on the Libyan conflict , for an immediate cease-fire and the start of a political settlement without any preconditions . '' \nThe airstrikes started March 19 , after the U.N. Security Council approved a resolution authorizing the use of force to protect civilians demanding the ouster of the ruler , who has been in power for nearly 42 years . \nA senior official in President Barack Obama 's administration said the U.S. government is `` very aware '' of the reports of Gadhafi 's son 's death , but can not confirm who , if anyone , died in a strike until they see the evidence . \nGunfire broke out around Tripoli after the news came out . \nA crowd of demonstrators gathered around the ruler 's compound . \nImages on Libyan state TV showed what appeared to be dozens of people chanting and waving flags . \nProtesters could be heard yelling , `` We want to redeem the martyr , '' and , `` Oh youth , this is time for jihad . '' \nThey were joined at one point by Ibrahim , who told the demonstrators , `` Every one of you are Saif al-Arab . '' \n`` We will make Libya the grave of all invaders , '' he told the crowd . \nA spokesman for the Libyan opposition doubted the report of the death . \n`` In all honesty , we never heard of Saif al-Arab until the start of the uprising , '' said Hafiz Ghoga , deputy chairman of the Transitional National Council in Benghazi . \n`` We do n't believe this is true , '' Ghoga said . \n`` It is all fabrications by the regime in a desperate attempt to get sympathy . \n... This regime constantly lies and keeps lying . '' \nDespite skepticism by some rebels , some opposition members celebrated the report of Saif al-Arab 's death in the streets of Benghazi . \nRevelers danced and sang overnight as the sound of celebratory gunfire pierced through the air . \n`` By God , we 're not supposed to rejoice anyone 's death , '' one man told CNN . \n`` But we want him to feel the pain and sorrow that we 're going through with our own people he killed . '' \nMany of the reported civilian deaths have come out of the western city of Misrata . \nOn Sunday , a witness there described especially intense shelling by government forces in the country 's third-largest city and speculated that the intensified attacks were tied directly to reports of the death of Gadhafi 's son . \nThis is not the first time the ruler has reportedly been at the site of an airstrike that killed one of his children . \nIn April 1986 , his adopted daughter , Hanna Gadhafi , was killed when U.S. forces launched an airstrike that targeted his residential compound . \nAt the time , U.S. President Ronald Reagan said the strikes were an act of self-defense following the bombing of a West Berlin , Germany , club that killed two American servicemen and injured several others . \nCNN 's Reza Sayah , Kareem Khadder , Saad Abedine and Phil Gast and contributed to this report . \n"}

'' \nGadhafi , wearing sunglasses and clad in brown tribal clothing , refused to accept the reporter 's assertion that they were not . \nNo one against us . \nAgainst me for what ?

'' \nHe reiterated an assertion he first made last week that his opponents have been given hallucinogens by al Qaeda operatives , and he said he felt betrayed by the United States , which had lifted its sanctions on the country after Gadhafi agreed to give up his pursuit of weapons of mass destruction in 2003 . \n`` I 'm surprised that we have an alliance with the West to fight al Qaeda , and now that we are fighting terrorists they have abandoned us , '' he said , according to Amanpour . \n`` Perhaps they want to occupy Libya . '' \nGadhafi called U.S. President Barack Obama a `` good man '' but said he might have been given `` misinformation . '' \n`` The statements I have heard from him must have come from someone else , '' Gadhafi said . \nU.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice was unimpressed . \n`` It sounds , just frankly , delusional , '' she told reporters . \n`` And when he can laugh in talking to American and international journalists while he is slaughtering his own people , it only underscores how unfit he is to lead and how disconnected he is from reality . \n`` It makes all the more important the urgent steps that we have taken over the course of the last week on a national basis , as well as the steps that we 've taken collectively through the United Nations and the Security Council , and we 're going to continue to keep the pressure on .

Joe Lieberman , I-Connecticut , to arm rebels in Libya fighting Moammar Gadhafi . \nThey had mixed thoughts on whether the United States should be involved in imposing a no-fly zone in that country to protect protestors from attacks by Libyan war planes . \nI would not suggest either of those courses for the moment , said Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana , the top Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee who indicated U.S. involvement could lead to war . \nDepending upon the method of delivery and what we decide to do we could decide to have a war in Libya to join the war in Afghanistan and Iraq . \nSen. Susan Collins , R-Maine , a member of the Armed Services Committee , said she would be leery of providing arms at this point but said she supports a no-fly zone . \nI do believe our allies may be able to join together with us to enforce a no-fly zone over Libya to help protect the people from Gadhafi , she said . \nAny actions that we take I believe should be in concert with our allies . \nSen. Lindsay Graham , R-South Carolina , who is also on the Armed Services Committee , credited the diplomatic efforts underway by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and suggested the U.S. work with the United Nations to stiffen and enforce sanctions against Libya . \nProviding arms , I m not sure that helps us , Graham said . \nI don t know if you could control right now who would get the arms . \nWhat I would suggest is that we really keep implementing U.N. sanctions on the economic side , on the travel side , go after assets , Graham added . \nAnd a no fly zone would make a lot of sense to me . \nThe three senators spoke in a Capitol hallway after a vote on the Senate floor . \nEarlier Monday , Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said he would withhold judgment on the idea from Lieberman , who made his comments Sunday on CNN s State of the Union . \nMcConnell said he has asked Sen. John McCain , R-Arizona , the top Republican on the Armed Services Committee , to brief Senate Republicans at their weekly policy lunch in the Capitol Tuesday about his trip to Egypt over the weekend . \nLieberman traveled to Egypt with McCain , and they appeared together on CNN Sunday . \nMcCain supported the idea of a no-fly zone but did not say if he supports providing arms to Libyans fighting Gadhafi . \nA no fly zone is a UN scenario ! \nFebruary 28 , 2011 09:57 pm at 9:57 pm | Liebermans take on anything in the middle east is an opinion that no one should listen to , and Bomb Bomb McCain lost all judgement and respect the day he brought the Palin Plague to the forefront . \nLieberman works for another country and can not be trusted and starting another war is just another way Republicans think they can get out of creating jobs like they promised to get back in the house . \nFebruary 28 , 2011 10:11 pm at 10:11 pm | What is it with Mccain and Lieberman ? \nWe cant even afford these other two wars we are fighting , and they are ready to get neck deep in Libya ? \nThese guys just dont get it . \nFebruary 28 , 2011 10:11 pm at 10:11 pm | GOP = Greed Over People P.S.

'' \n`` They love me , all my people with me , they love me all . \nThey will die to protect me , my people , '' he said . \nGovernment forces have repeatedly clashed with demonstrators over the past two weeks in Libya , fired on crowds and at times shot indiscriminately at people in the streets , numerous witnesses have told CNN . \nThe death toll has topped 1,000 , according to an estimate from U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon . \nUN imposes sanctions on Libya Clinton outraged at Libya , Iran Gadhafi control wanes outside Tripoli Soon after Gadhafi 's interview , U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice said the Libyan strongman sounded `` delusional . '' \n`` And when he can laugh in talking to American and international journalists while he is slaughtering his own people , it only underscores how unfit he is to lead and how disconnected he is from reality , '' she said . \nGadhafi 's regime has lost control of parts of the country to rebel forces , and with each passing day more Libyan officials around the world have defected , joining calls for his ouster . \nThe use of the term `` rebel '' to describe the anti-government forces is apt , said Kurt Volker , former U.S. ambassador to NATO and now a senior fellow at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Forces . \n`` In Egypt , you did n't have a force that was developed ; you had protesters who were demonstrating against the government and the government relented , '' he told CNN in a telephone interview . \n`` Here , you actually have a government that retains force at its disposal and you have demonstrators joined by elements of the military that have forces at their disposal . \nSo it really has become an armed rebellion . '' \nEven as Gadhafi sought to project confidence Monday , reports came in that a military jet bombed a military base in an area controlled by rebel forces . \nThe base is near Ajdabiya , 90 miles south of Benghazi , a stronghold of government opponents . \nSome bases in the area have fallen into the hands of protesters as more members of the military have abandoned Gadhafi 's regime and joined demonstrations . \nSeveral soldiers told CNN they switched their allegiance after refusing to use weapons against peaceful demonstrators . \nCNN saw the military jet fly overhead and heard the sounds of explosions . \nWitnesses reported a bombing at the base . \nBut Libyan state television later denied any such bombing had occurred . \nThe Temporary General Committee for Defense said reports that the Libyan air force conducted strikes on the ammunition depots in the cities of Ajdabiya and Rajima were false , state TV reported . \nWhile CNN has staff in some cities , the network can not independently confirm reports for many areas in Libya . \nCNN has gathered information through telephone interviews with witnesses . \nPro-Gadhafi forces also tried to attack a radio station in Misrata , a city controlled by protesters , a witness said . \nA military chopper with soldiers on board has tried to land a couple of times over the past three days , but the opposition fired at the soldiers and kept them away , the witness said . \nThe international community , meanwhile , launched new efforts Monday to pressure Gadhafi to halt the violence . \nSenators take tough stance on Libya Gadhafi 's history of tension with the West `` He has lost his legitimacy when he declared war on his people , '' Secretary-General Ban said about embattled Libyan leader , urging him to heed the call of his people . \nPentagon spokesman Col. David Lapan said the United States is `` repositioning '' naval and air forces in the region to be prepared for any option that it may need to exercise . \nHe would not comment on whether any ground forces are being put on alert or having leaves canceled because of Libya . \nU.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said at a meeting in Geneva , Switzerland , of the U.N. Human Rights Council that the United States is exploring `` all possible options , '' and that `` nothing is off the table so long as the Libyan government continues to threaten and kill Libyan citizens . '' \n`` Colonel Gadhafi and those around him must be held accountable for these acts , which violate international legal obligations and common decency . \nThrough their actions , they have lost the legitimacy to govern . \nAnd the people of Libya have made themselves clear : It is time for Gadhafi to go , now , without further violence or delay , '' she said . \nAsked at a news conference whether the U.S. planned an imminent military response , Clinton said , `` No. '' White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Monday that `` exile is certainly one option '' for Gadhafi . \nCarney also said the U.S. government is considering the possibility of imposing a no-fly zone over Libya . \nAlso Monday , the United States became the latest country to announce it had frozen Gadhafi-related assets . \nThe U.S. government froze at least $ 30 billion in Libyan government assets under U.S jurisdiction after enacting sanctions on Friday , a Treasury official said . \nIt marked the largest amount ever blocked under a sanctions program , according to Acting Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David Cohen . \nIn Tripoli , protesters stayed off the streets , telling CNN they feared violence . \nGovernment officials spread word that thousands of people could die if the popular uprising continues . \nOn the 14th day of protests , there appeared to be a stalemate . \nSome in Tripoli told CNN they feared their protest movement was losing momentum . \nBut around the world , support for the protests was growing . \nYet another prominent Libyan official , the country 's ambassador to South Africa , added his voice to the calls for Gadhafi to end his nearly 42-year grip on power . \nGadhafi `` should take the ultimate decision to step down in the interest of Libya , '' Abdullah Alzubedi told reporters in Pretoria . \nThe European Union 's high representative for foreign affairs , Catherine Ashton , said the U.N. Human Rights Council `` has a grave responsibility to ensure that our often-stated intentions are translated into real actions and real progress . '' \nSpeaking at the meeting in Geneva , Ashton said , `` What matters in the end is not the number of resolutions passed but results in the real world . '' \nIn an interview with CNN , Ashton said stopping the violence means trying `` to persuade the people concerned that they will be held to account , that there will be the International Criminal Court , that we will stop their assets being moved , that we will hold them to account for their actions . \nThat 's what we do as an international community . \nThat 's what we have to make clear . \nAnd there 's no doubt in my mind that actually they do listen to what 's being said . '' \nThe U.N. Security Council over the weekend voted for tough restrictions and possible war crimes charges against the Libyan regime . \nThe Security Council measures -- which include an arms embargo , an asset freeze and travel bans for Gadhafi and members of his family and associates -- also referred the situation unfolding in Libya to the International Criminal Court . \nOn Sunday , Gadhafi criticized the Security Council resolution , telling private Serbian station Pink TV by phone that council members `` took a decision based on media reports that are based abroad .

'' \nCNN is withholding his real name for his own safety . \nOn an almost hourly basis , regime officials and government minders tell foreign journalists that Tripoli is a stronghold of Gadhafi and that dissent has vanished in recent months . \nCNN , like other media here , is under severe government restrictions . \nBut I recently managed to slip away from government minders to talk directly to several Libyans . \nAnd according to several eyewitness accounts , major demonstrations were held against Libya 's strongman as recently as last week . \nAnd in the Souq al-Juma neighborhood of the capital , where anti-Gadhafi protests first erupted in February , the government 's propaganda bubble is quickly burst . \nWhile international journalists including me were ferried by government minders to a pro-Gadhafi rally at Green Square on Friday afternoon , multiple sources tell CNN that several Tripoli neighborhoods were wracked by running battles between protesters and security forces . \n`` They were protesting right around the corner . \nThey streamed out of a mosque and onto the small square , '' said Mahmoud . \n`` Almost immediately Gadhafi forces fired at them with live rounds . '' \nMahmoud and other sources say that the group was several hundred strong . \nHe claims that three people were killed and that the area was put under lockdown by government security . \nOther people in the area confirmed the death toll , but it is impossible for CNN to independently verify this account . \nThe government has repeatedly denied any anti-Gadhafi protests in Tripoli in recent weeks , including on Friday . \nA taxi driver in his 20s also said that he took part in one of the protests in Souq al-Juma on Friday . \nCNN is calling him Jamal -- not his real name -- to protect his safety . \n`` We came out after afternoon prayers , '' he said , `` we were unarmed and peaceful and they just shot at us . '' \nHe says he a bullet grazed his arm . \nJamal says that unlike the rebels in the East , they do n't have easy access to weapons to fight . \nBut he says , `` I am not afraid . \nEven though we were unarmed , I am doing this for the future of my country . '' \nAnother protest was fired upon in a seaside neighborhood of the capital , Jamal says , citing friends who said they were at the demonstration . \nSpeaking to journalists in Tripoli is risky . \nGadhafi 's vast spying network means that almost anyone on the street could be an informer or worse . \nResidents of Souq al-Juma say that hundreds , if not thousands , have been summarily arrested by the dreaded intelligence `` brigades . '' \nThey are never heard from again . \nAnd it seems nowhere is safe . \nJamal says that recently , a family he knows pinned up a rebel flag out of sight in their home . \nSomehow the intelligence services found out . \n`` They stormed into the house , pulled down the flag , and arrested every man in that house , '' says Jamal . \nBut the worst indignity of all , people here say , is they ca n't bury their dead . \n`` The Gadhafi men . \nThey come out and shoot you like cats , '' Mahmoud told me . \n`` they hold their guns over you like this and shoot you like cats . \nWe are not people to them .

'' \nFour months on , the rebels are not capable of supporting themselves , McGregor said . \nThey are out of fuel , oil production has shut down , and they have few available resources . \nThey will soon face even shortages of food and water , McGregor said . \nPresident Barack Obama faces pressure at home to withdraw U.S. forces . \nThere is debate , too , in Europe over the expensive air campaign . \nThe war may have been morally right , but NATO , said McGregor , is facing a conundrum . \nPart of that failure was a lack of consideration of the makeup of the Libyan population , said University of Texas political scientist Alan J. Kuperman , author of `` The Limits of Humanitarian Intervention . '' \n`` The fundamental error by the White House and NATO was to imagine that the Libyan people were united in opposition to Gadhafi , '' he said . \n`` In reality , Libya is divided along lines of clan and tribe , some of whom benefit greatly from Gadhafi , and therefore defend him fiercely , '' he said . \n`` Any expert on ethnic conflict and intervention could have told the White House that ahead of time . '' \nIn that respect , said Thomas Donnelly , director of the Center for Defense Studies , the Libyan war has the potential for fallout that is worse than what happened after President George W. Bush declared `` mission accomplished '' weeks after Saddam Hussein 's 2003 ouster in the Iraq war . \n`` To imagine that Libyans are going to come together -- is a hope , but not a plan , '' Donnelly said . \n`` It was a mistake to get involved in such a feckless way . '' \nBehind the rhetorical rallying cry of protecting civilians , Donnelly said , has always been the real aim of NATO -- to kill Gadhafi . \n`` If you made me bet my mortgage at gunpoint , I 'd say we probably will get Gadhafi , '' he said . \nBut the question is when . \nAnd if it does n't happen in a timely fashion , then NATO risks the erosion of public support for its campaign , Donnelly said . \n`` In some sense , 100 days is a short period of time , '' he said . \n`` But when your political support is so tenuous and thin , and when your operations have heretofore been ineffective in achieving campaign goals , then taking ground forces off the table has not made the war any shorter or any less bloody . '' \nThe Libyan regime has also proven itself to be more robust and resilient than anyone imagined . \nIt would be a mistake , said Donnelly , to assume that killing Gadhafi would mean a collapse of the entire system . \nThe Libya conflict has sometimes been compared to NATO 's air war in the Balkans in the 1990s . \nMany people thought the Serbs would go down instantly once NATO began bombing . \nAnd eventually , it was the threat of a ground invasion that led to the capitulation of then-Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic . \nGadhafi , however , faces no such threat . \nAnd some believe the arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court this week will only help strengthen his resolve to stay in power . \n`` If Barack Obama had thought a hundred days ago that he would be where he is now , you have to wonder whether he would have made the same decision , '' Donnelly said . \n`` How can you tell the American people we 're going to start jumping over the fence and we have no idea where we are going to come down ? '' \nBut not everyone is pessimistic about prospects in Libya . \nAli Ahmida , for one , stands by his belief that the Libyan opposition can defeat Gadhafi . \nThe rebels , he said , have made noticeable gains with the support of NATO air power . \nHe cited recent rebel takeovers of western towns in the Nafusa Mountains and said Gadhafi is more isolated now than ever before . \n`` The Libyan people are capable of fighting this fight , '' said Ahmida , an analyst at the University of New England . \n`` The consequences of this , even though it is more painful and brutal , will have a positive outcome in the end . '' \nIt has not been easy for Ahmida to watch the conflict unfold in Libya . \nBut he is a strong proponent for self-determination who feels strongly that the Libyan people , not outside forces , must determine their fate . \n`` I warned against this from the start , that Libyan public opinion would not like it , '' he said , referring to the possibility of foreign boots on the ground . \nAnd Ahmida still questions the motivation of Western powers and the agendas of exiles who he fears may want to exploit oil-rich Libya . \n`` I 'm optimistic but guarded , '' he said . \nAhmida said the bad news is that NATO lacked clarity in its mission and also in a negotiated exit for Gadhafi , which he said is more difficult now because of the arrest warrant for alleged crimes against humanity . \nStill , Gadhafi 's regime will fall , he said . \nThen the real battle for the future of Libya will just be starting . \n"}

' \nWe believed them , '' she said . \n`` After that , they started shooting the people . \nWhy did they lie ?

'' \nTo counter that , the government is using `` military squads of African origin , '' the source said , voicing the same claim made by Majbari . \n`` They are not restricted or bound by tribal ties , '' and can therefore be better counted on to suppress the opposition . \n`` Violence in the east will escalate because of the tribal mentality of revenge , '' the source said , claiming reports of violence there had already fueled sporadic demonstrations in western Libya . \nGadhafi 's regime , however , has sought to portray a different picture of events . \nHaving previously aired extensive footage of pro-Gadhafi rallies in Tripoli , a Libyan state television program on Saturday described the anti-government protests as acts of sabotage . \nThe report claimed that hospitals , banks , courthouses , prisons , security centers and military police headquarters had been burned , showing videos of buildings on fire and the aftermath of destroyed and scorched locales . \nThe anchor said that security forces had managed to arrest dozens of people , claiming they were part of a foreign network of agitators trained to spark clashes and create chaos . \nThe official Jamahiriya News Agency also reported that Gadhafi had spoken in recent days with fellow leaders from Guinea , Liberia and Yemen . \nThe government also sent out , via text , a tacit warning against `` the inappropriate use of telecommunications services -LRB- that -RRB- contradict our religion ... our customs ... and our traditions . '' \nInternet service in Libya shut down Friday evening , though it was more available by Sunday . \nThe government 's firm grip on power heightened the concerns of a woman from Benghazi , who urged U.S. President Barack Obama and other world leaders to help the Libyan people in the face of the government crackdown . \n`` We have no freedom here , '' she said . \n`` I speak to all the world , to America , to Mr. Obama : Please help us . \nWe -LRB- did -RRB- nothing . \nWe want to live a good life .

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told reporters unequivocally : `` The violence must stop . '' \nHis remarks came as state television was airing images of the embattled but defiant strongman urging viewers to defend the nation . \nA man CNN will identify only as Reda to protect his identity said in a telephone interview that armed men dressed in plainclothes fatally shot his two brothers Friday as they were demonstrating against the government . \nAlso killed were his two neighbors , he said . \n`` The bodies have been kidnapped from the street , '' Reda said . \n`` My other neighbors told me they kidnapped the injured people in the hospital to somewhere , nobody knows -LRB- where -RRB- . \nThis is the perfect crime . \nHe 's hiding all evidence for every crime he has . \nThis is the horrible situation that nobody knows . '' \nState Dept. ` concerned ' for Libyans More than 1,000 people have been killed , according to estimates cited Friday by Ban . \nHe noted that the eastern part of the country `` is reported to be under the control of opposition elements , who have taken over arms and ammunition from weapon depots . '' \nAt least three cities near Tripoli have been the site of daily clashes , and the streets of the capital are largely deserted because people are afraid of being shot by government forces or militias , he said . \nLibyan leader Moammar Gadhafi 's supporters `` are reportedly conducting house-by-house searches and arrests . \nAccording to some reports , they have even gone into hospitals to kill wounded opponents , '' Ban said . \nAccounts from the news media and human rights groups and witnesses `` raise grave concerns about the nature and scale of the conflict , '' he said . \nHe said they include reports of indiscriminate killings , shooting of peaceful demonstrators , torture of the opposition and use of foreign mercenaries . \nThe victims have included women and children and `` indiscriminate attacks on foreigners believed to be mercenaries , '' he said , referring to reports . \nBan called on the international community `` to do everything possible '' to protect civilians at demonstrable risk . \nBan said there appeared to be a growing crisis of refugees , with some 22,000 people having fled to Tunisia and a reported 15,000 to Egypt in the past few days . \nFor many , the trip has been a harrowing one . \n`` There are widespread reports of refugees being harassed and threatened with guns and knives , '' Ban said . \n`` The violence must stop , '' he said . \n`` Those responsible for so brutally shedding the blood of innocents must be punished . \nFundamental human rights must be respected . '' \nBan said he will travel Monday to Washington to speak with U.S. President Barack Obama . \nReport : Libyan protesters fired upon Also at the United Nations , Libyan Ambassador Abdurrahman Mohamed Shalgham told reporters that he hoped Gadhafi and his sons would end the rampage `` against our people '' within hours . \nAsked why he had continued to support Gadhafi until just a few days ago , the diplomat said , `` I could n't imagine in the beginning that it was going to be -LRB- this bad -RRB- . '' \nBut he now supports the protesters . \n`` It 's not a crime to say , ' I want to be free , ' '' he said . \nThe Libyan ambassador to the United States , Ali Suleiman Aujali , told CNN that he too has joined the opposition . \n`` When I see the mercenaries killing our peoples , and we see our women screaming in the street , and I see there is no distinguishing between who they are target , I ca n't take this , '' said the diplomat , who served the Libyan government 's foreign service for more than 40 years . \nHe said his fellow diplomats and many of the country 's police had also turned against Gadhafi in his quest to retain control of Libya . \n`` The problem now is western part , '' he said , speaking in Washington . \n`` Unfortunately , they 've been confronted with mercenaries . '' \nAsked whether he would want to see his former boss dead , he said , `` I want him to be out of my country . \nI want him to be out of the Libyan life . '' \nAs he spoke , reports emerged of sniper and artillery fire in Tripoli , said Mohammed Ali Abdallah of the National Front for the Salvation of Libya , which opposes Gadhafi 's regime . \nHe based his account on reports that he said he received from witnesses . \nAnother witness told CNN that protesters in western Tripoli were met by plainclothes security forces who fired guns at them and later tear gas to disperse the crowds . \nPrior to the clashes on Friday morning , security forces had removed barricades , disposed of bodies and painted over graffiti in Tripoli , witnesses said . \nOn state television , Gadhafi -- wearing a fur trooper 's hat and addressing a crowd of supporters -- threatened to escalate the violence . \n`` We can destroy any assault with the people 's will , with the armed people , '' he said . \n`` And when it is necessary , the weapons depots will be open to all the Libyan people to be armed . '' \nAt that time , he continued , `` Libya will become a red fire , Libya will become an ember . '' \nHe vowed to overcome what he described as external forces attempting to take down his nation . \n`` We will defeat any foreign attempt like we defeated them before , like we did with the Italian colonization , like we did with American airstrikes . '' \nBut he presented a carrot with his stick , offering to increase state salaries by 150 % and to give $ 400 to each family . \nEarlier , Gadhafi 's son said his father has no intention of stepping down . \nAsked if Gadhafi has a `` Plan B '' to leave Libya , Saif al-Islam Gadhafi told CNN Turk : `` We have Plan A , Plan B , Plan C. Plan A is to live and die in Libya . \nPlan B is to live and die in Libya . \nPlan C is to live and die in Libya . '' \nHe said he hoped Libya would emerge from the crisis united . \n`` I am sure Libya will have a better future , '' he said . \n`` However , such a strong state as we are , we will never allow our people to be controlled by a handful of terrorists . \nThis will never happen . '' \nBut global leaders were meeting Friday to talk about what kind of pressure can be brought on Gadhafi to surrender control and limit the humanitarian consequences . \nWhite House press secretary Jay Carney said Washington was suspending embassy operations in Tripoli and pursuing sanctions . \n`` It has been shuttered , '' he told reporters about the embassy . \nBut State Department officials said they still have channels through which they can still communicate with the Libyan government . \nLibyan employees were remaining at the embassy , said Under Secretary ofState for Management Patrick Kennedy . \n`` The flag is still flying . \nThe embassy is not closed . \nOperations are suspended , '' he said . \n`` Relations are not broken . '' \nThe charge d'affaires at the embassy , Joan Polaschik , expressed relief that she and other Americans had left . \n`` It 's a very dangerous and fluid situation , '' she told CNN in a telephone interview from Istanbul , Turkey . \nBut she praised the Libyan forces who were charged with providing security for the embassy . \n`` They stayed with me till the bitter end , '' she said . \nThe United Nations Security Council discussed a proposed draft resolution that would impose new sanctions on Libya . \nThey include an arms embargo , asset freeze and a travel ban . \nThe draft also refers Libya to the International Criminal Court . \nAn Obama administration official involved in deliberations regarding sanctions told CNN that the Libyan government has said it has as much as $ 130 billion in reserves and another $ 70 billion in foreign assets held abroad . \nThe legally binding resolution is backed by the possible threat of force but approval of such measures could be stalled by Russia and China , both unlikely to support military intervention . \nA vote on the resolution could occur Saturday . \nCNN crew greeted as ` liberating heroes ' NATO Secretary-General Anders Rasmussen said the alliance has assets that can be used in this crisis and that it could `` act as an enabler and coordinator , if and when , individual member states want to take action . '' \nMeanwhile , foreign nationals faced a `` massive challenge , '' Rasmussen said , as they braved rough seas to escape the violence in the north African nation . \nA British ship left Benghazi -- the nation 's second-largest city -- with 207 people on board . \nA ferry carrying 338 people -- 183 of them Americans -- departed Tripoli Friday and arrived in Malta at night . \n`` I feel for the people who are still there and did n't get a chance to get out , because it 's chaos , '' said Yusra Tekbalim , one of the passengers . \nShe said she had remained hunkered down in her house for four days , during which she heard what sounded like machine-gun fire . \n`` I think that the Libyans know what this regime is capable of , but I think for the first time the world is actually seeing it , '' she said . \nAnother ferry arrived in Malta from Tripoli carrying more than 300 people , including 200 employees of Schlumberger , the oil and gas technology , and their families , a company spokeswoman said . \nLibya 's uprising , after four decades of Gadhafi 's iron rule , took root first in the nation 's eastern province . \nBenghazi and other smaller eastern towns are no longer within Gadhafi 's control . \nBut closer to Tripoli , where the dictator maintains some support , protesters were still being met with brute force . \nThe city of Zawiya -- about 55 kilometers -LRB- 35 miles -RRB- west of Tripoli -- was the epicenter of violent protests Thursday . \nDoctors at a field hospital said early Friday that 17 people were killed and 150 more wounded when government forces attacked . \nCNN could not confirm reports for many areas in Libya . \nThe Libyan government maintains tight control of communications and has not responded to repeated requests for access to the country . \nCNN has interviewed numerous witnesses by phone . \nAnti-government forces said they had gained control of Zawiya as Gadhafi accused followers of Osama bin Laden of adding hallucinogenic drugs to residents ' drinks to spark the unrest . \n`` They put it with milk or with other drinks , spiked drinks , '' he said Thursday in a telephone call to state television . \nThe international fallout , like the protests , has also spread . \nSwitzerland ordered Gadhafi 's assets frozen , the foreign ministry said . \nCNN 's Yousuf Basil , Ben Wedeman , Saad Abedine , Richard Roth , John King , Whitney Hurst , Pam Benson , Ingrid Formanek and Salma Abdelaziz contributed to this report . \n"}

Security Council voted unanimously Saturday night to punish Moammar Gadhafi 's government in Libya for violence against unarmed civilians , hours after the nation 's budding opposition picked a former top official as its interim leader . \nThe draft resolution includes an arms embargo , asset freeze and travel bans for Gadhafi and several of his family members and associates . \nIt also refers the situation unfolding in Libya to the International Criminal Court . \n`` This resolution will be a signal -LRB- to -RRB- put an end to the fascist regime that is still in existence , '' said Abdurrahman Mohamed Shalgham , Libyan ambassador to the United Nations , who urged action Friday in an emotional appeal . \nHe 'd earlier renounced support for Gadhafi , calling him Saturday `` a leader who loves nobody but himself . '' \nMilitary and security forces loyal to Gadhafi have killed more than 1,000 people , U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon has estimated . \nMeanwhile , Libya 's deputy amassador to the world body , Ibrahim Dabbashi , indicated Saturday that he and fellow diplomats `` support ... in principle '' a caretaker administration to lead Libya under the direction of former Justice Minister Mustafa Abdul Jalil . \nEmbassy head : ` We were lucky to get out ' State Dept. ` concerned ' for Libyans City councils in areas no longer loyal to Gadhafi chose Jalil to head an interim government that would represent all of Libya and ultimately be based in Tripoli , according to Amal Bogagies , a member of the coalition of the February 17 Uprising , and a separate Libyan opposition source . \nBoth are based in Benghazi . \nJalil was in Gadhafi 's government through February 21 , when he quit to protest the `` bloody situation '' and `` use of excessive force '' against unarmed protesters , according to Libyan newspaper Quryna . \nDays later , he told a Swedish newspaper he had evidence that Gadhafi ordered the 1988 bombing of a jet over Lockerbie , Scotland , that killed 270 people . \nProtests began February 15 in the eastern city of Benghazi , Libya 's second largest . \nIt and many others are now thought to be under opposition control , according to eyewitnesses . \nThere have been numerous reports of widespread violence , some of it perpetrated by foreign mercenaries and military and security forces loyal to Gadhafi . \nLibya 's foreign minister said earlier Saturday that talks are underway between Gadhafi 's government and figures in the eastern part of the North African nation . \nBenghazi-based opposition spokesman Jalal Igallal , however , strongly knocked down reports of any discussions between anti-government figures and officials supportive of Gadhafi . \nHe urged Foreign Minister Musa Kasa to say who is being talked to , if such negotiations are in fact ongoing . \nEarly Sunday , Saif al-Islam Gadhafi -- one of Moammar ' Gadhafi 's sons and a prominent member of his government -- told CNN 's Nic Robertson that he was confident the regime could survive the unrest and ultimately reunite Libya . \nSaif Gadhafi added that he wanted this reunification to be accomplished without violence . \nWhile CNN does have staff in some cities , the network could not independently confirm reports for many areas in Libya . \nBut CNN has compiled information through telephone interviews with witnesses . \nTripoli itself was noticeably tense but largely quiet overnight Saturday , its streets largely barren except for police , armed men in civilian clothing and young people with sticks at some intersections . \nOne man , who is not named for safety reasons , described an `` eerie feeling '' around the capital , even as fear of violence drove many people to hunker down in their homes . \n`` You can feel the tension and the anticipation that something big is going to happen , '' he said . \n`` Everyone is waiting for it . '' \nThe situation at the main airport , about 20 miles south of Tripoli , was far more chaotic . \nSeveral thousand people camped outside in makeshift tents , waiting for the chance to leave the war-torn country . \nMore than 200 Arab organizations and a group of 30 prominent intellectuals from across the Middle East and North Africa urged global bodies , including the Security Council , the European Union and the African Union , to take action to limit further death and destruction . \nA protester 's view from Libya Libyan : U.S. ` does n't give a damn ' `` We fear we may be witnessing the calm before the storm , '' said their statement . \n`` The window of opportunity to prevent further atrocities from occurring is closing fast . \nThe people of Libya need you to act quickly and decisively . '' \nThe group urged the international community to devise contingency plans for intervention and impose immediate sanctions on the Libyan regime . \n`` We appeal to you as leaders who have the power to bring an end to this horror , '' the statement said . \n`` Your failure to do so would be a lasting stain on the responsibilities of world leadership and on humanity itself . '' \nU.S. President Barack Obama also weighed in Saturday , telling German Chancellor Angela Merkel to `` coordinate our urgent efforts to respond to developments and ensure appropriate accountability , '' according to a White House statement . \nIn some of his strongest wording to date , Obama said , `` when a leader 's only means of staying in power is to use mass violence against his own people , he has lost the legitimacy to rule and needs to do what is right for his country by leaving now . '' \nLater , U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton issued a statement urging Gadhafi to step down . \n`` Moammar Gadhafi has lost the confidence of his people and he should go without further bloodshed and violence , '' Clinton said . \n`` The Libyan people deserve a government that is responsive to their aspirations and that protects their universally recognized human rights . '' \nTripoli 's Green Square , occupied by pro-Gadhafi demonstrators on previous evenings , was empty Saturday night , a witness told CNN . \nShe said her neighborhood near the square was eerily quiet . \nAnother man said men carrying automatic weapons had set up checkpoints at `` every major intersection or traffic light , '' while hospitals are heavily guarded by armed security personnel . \nOther frightened residents said they stayed indoors , though unable to shut off the sound of gunfire or put aside the words of Gadhafi in a public address the day before in which he vowed to keep unleashing force . \n`` We can destroy any assault with the people 's will , with the armed people , '' he said on state television Friday . \n`` And when it is necessary , the weapons depots will be open to all the Libyan people to be armed . '' \nLibya 's prime minister , meanwhile , announced on state television that every family would receive 500 Libyan dinars -LRB- $ 406 -RRB- from the government . \nThe humanitarian group Doctors Without Borders said in a statement Saturday one of its teams was in Benghazi . \nTheir arrival , and a promise of future aid , marked one of the first humanitarian inroads into Libya in recent weeks . \nThree main hospitals were all `` well equipped and have managed to deal with the numbers of wounded people and medical needs , '' according to the group . \nBut the facilities also face shortages of drugs , bandages and other medical items , which Doctors Without Borders said it will provide . \nThe group plans to send an orthopedic surgeon , anesthesiologist and nurse on Monday . \nThe advocacy group Human Rights Watch said the situation was appreciably worse in Zawiya -- about 55 kilometers -LRB- 35 miles -RRB- west of Tripoli and the epicenter of violent protests Thursday . \n`` West of Tripoli in Zawiya city , government security forces firing on demonstrators are causing bloodshed and chaos , '' said Sarah Leah Whitson , the group 's Middle East and North Africa director . \nOperations at several embassies -- including those of Great Britain and the United States -- in Tripoli have been effectively shuttered , for the safety of their personnel . \nU.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he planned to speak with Obama in Washington on Monday . \nFor now , Libyans themselves are left to wait to see what happens next . \n`` We wait and see what tomorrow will bring , '' a Tripoli man said early Sunday . \n`` We pray for a quick ending to this nightmare , with minimum bloodshed . \nNo one is naive , however , to believe that Gadhafi is going to go easily .

'' \n`` It is very sad , '' he said . \n`` We are losing people every day on both sides . \nWe think it is time to sit down and talk . '' \nNATO warplanes and missiles have been pounding Gadhafi 's forces and government installations since March 31 as Gadhafi attempts to put down a nearly three-month-old revolt against his rule . \nSecretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen told CNN on Monday that Gadhafi and his regime `` have no future , '' but refused to predict how long the Libyan leader could hold on . \nRasmussen denied that the situation in Libya had devolved into a `` stalemate , '' insisting that NATO was `` making progress '' and had `` taken out '' a substantial part of Gadhafi 's military capability . \nHe said a political solution was required to bring the conflict to an end , but `` It 's hard to imagine an end to the violence as long as Gadhafi remains in power . '' \nDespite the ongoing bombardment , Gadhafi 's forces have been inflicting a heavy toll on rebels in the port city of Misrata , survivors there have told CNN . \nMisrata is the only city in western Libya held by the rebels , and witnesses say indiscriminate shelling has left victims with crushed bones , burns and amputations . \n`` They are shelling the port and civilian neighborhoods . \nIt has become an operation of revenge , not just taking over the city of Misrata , '' said Ibrahim al-Neairy , a rebel who was injured in the fighting and evacuated to Benghazi . \nAlleged rape victim flees Libya She fled Gadhafi , wants to see family It has become an operation of revenge , not just taking over the city of Misrata -- Ibrahim al-Neairy , wounded rebel Mostafa Bozen , a spokesman for the rebels , said fighters attacked Gadhafi 's forces about 22 kilometers -LRB- 14 miles -RRB- from Tripoli , killing 12 and hitting a tank . \nThe situation in Misrata `` is at the forefront '' of U.N. concerns about Libya 's civilian population , Valerie Amos , the U.N. undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs , told the Security Council on Monday . \nTwo months of fighting and the ongoing shelling of the city 's port has prevented aid ships from docking there , and between 150 and 300 non-Libyans are still waiting to be evacuated , she said . \n`` Some people are running short of food , water and other basics , '' she said . \n`` Medical facilities need supplies and more trained personnel . '' \nThe Security Council voted in March to authorize the use of force to protect Libyan civilians from Gadhafi 's regime . \nNearly 750,000 people have fled the country , another 58,000 are displaced within Libya and another 5,000 are stranded at border crossings into Libya , Tunisia and Niger , Amos said . \nFor those who remain , Amos said the fighting and the sanctions imposed on Gadhafi and his allies have caused `` a severe disruption of supply lines within the country . '' \nThe results have been `` shortages of fuel , difficulties in obtaining commodities including foodstuffs , medicines and other essential goods , and there have been severe cash shortages throughout the country . '' \nWestern Libya has about three months ' supply of food remaining ; the mostly rebel-held east has about two months , she said . \nFuel and supplies for desalinization plants and other facilities that provide fresh water to many Libyans `` are running out , '' she added . \nThere have been widespread assumptions among experts that the conflict between pro- and anti-Gadhafi forces will continue to be a stalemate for some time . \nAs time wears on , though , human rights groups have expressed growing concern for besieged Libyans in Misrata . \nThe wounded arriving in Benghazi , the rebel hub city , painted a gruesome picture of the fighting in Misrata . \nHanan Muhammad , who was evacuated along with about 800 others on an aid ship charted by the International Organization for Migration , was wounded when a missile struck near her home . \n`` I was in my house praying when the first missile landed . \nShortly after , more missiles , one after another started hitting our neighborhood , '' said Muhammad , who suffered a broken arm and shrapnel wounds . \nPeople are scared every moment of the day no matter their age , '' she said . \n`` Oh God , it 's like a horror movie . '' \nAl-Neairy , who suffered facial burns and shrapnel wounds , said he does not regret fighting . \n`` The price for freedom is high and it -LRB- is -RRB- necessary to be liberated from this regime , '' he said . \nAmnesty International has said Gadhafi 's attacks in the port city may amount to war crimes . \nA report issued last week by the monitoring group accused pro-Gadhafi forces of the `` unlawful killing of civilians due to indiscriminate attacks , including use of heavy artillery , rockets and cluster bombs in civilian areas and sniper fire against residents . '' \n`` I 'm not going to guess about a timeline . \nI want a solution sooner rather than later , '' Rasmussen said . \nCNN 's Jomana Karadsheh , Sara Sidner and Amir Ahmed contributed to this report . \n"}

'' \nTwo years later , Libya was implicated in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 , which exploded over Lockerbie , Scotland . \nIn 1999 , Gadhafi tried to thaw his icy relationship with the West , agreeing to demands to turn over suspects in the Lockerbie bombing . \nIn 2003 , he agreed to eliminate his pursuit and stockpile of weapons of mass destruction . \nThe moves helped Libya regain diplomatic relations with the United States in 2006 . \nIn 2008 , however , Swiss officials jailed one of Gadhafi 's sons , prompting the furious leader to cut off the country 's oil supplies , withdraw Libyan money from Swiss banks and threaten to sever diplomatic ties . \nTwo years ago , Gadhafi returned to the international spotlight yet again when Scotland agreed to release convicted Lockerbie bomber Abdel Basset al-Megrahi , who received a hero 's welcome in Libya . \nScottish authorities said al-Megrahi was terminally ill with cancer and , as a result , was released on compassionate grounds . \nSkeptics , including several U.S. senators , contend that al-Megrahi was released as part of a deal fueled by British business interests in Libya , including oil giant BP . \nLibya is one of Europe 's key oil suppliers . \nCNN 's Alan Silverleib , Jill Dougherty and Mike Pearson contributed to this report . \n"}

{"id": "313", "time": "2011-02-21", "text": "By the CNN Wire Staff NEW : Witnesses report gunfire , masked men blasting pro-Gadhafi music in Tripoli NEW : Death toll nationwide now up to at least 219 , medical sources say Moammar Gadhafi 's son says foreign media have overstated the violence in Libya Witnesses report that protesters aided by military have taken over Benghazi -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The son of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi early Monday proposed the speedy implementation of significant democratic reforms in the traditionally restrictive country , while warning of a chaotic civil war , return to colonialism and mass poverty if citizens sided with anti-government demonstrators . \n`` Tomorrow , we can speak rationally , we can spare the blood , we can stand all together for the sake of Libya , '' Saif al-Islam Gadhafi said during a speech on Libyan state television that he said was unscripted . \nBut if the unrest continues , `` forget about democracy , forget about reform ... It will be a fierce civil war . '' \nWhile criticizing international media for overstating its extent , the younger Gadhafi acknowledged the violence in Libya as well as `` mistakes '' by police and military in addressing unrest . \nStill , he principally blamed drunks , criminals and foreigners for fanning dissent and instigating attacks that threatened to tear apart Libya . \nWitness : It can only be called genocide Obtaining independent confirmation on events in Libya is very difficult . \nThe Libyan government maintains tight control on communications and has not responded to repeated requests from CNN for access to the country . \nCNN has interviewed , however , numerous witnesses by phone . \nSaif Gadhafi , appointed in 2009 as Libya 's general coordinator , insisted his father , Moammar , was not like recently deposed Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali . \nHe also said Libya was unlike those two countries , predicting that its civil war would be `` 1,000 times worse '' and its economic hardship even more severe should the current government fall . \nHe conceded these are `` difficult times '' and that `` there are people inside Libya who are opposing us . '' \nEven while he cast blame , the leader 's son also acknowledged changing times regionally and proposed `` radical '' reforms -- like bolstering local governments , relaxing restrictive laws , raising salaries , extending loans and drafting a constitution , which does n't now exist . \nMichele Dunne , an expert at the Carnegie Endowment for Peace , noted that the Western-educated Saif Gadhafi has pushed such reforms previously , but they have not gotten much traction . \nMeanwhile , eyewitnesses -- who are not being identified , for security reasons -- told CNN about significant movement and growing violence on Sunday , the sixth consecutive day of unrest in the isolated and reclusive North African nation . \nMedical sources and others on the ground have said that at least 219 had died nationwide in the violence . \nSaif Gadhafi , though , claimed in his speech that international media had overstated the death toll . \nHe also claimed foreign nations and `` illegal immigrants '' had stirred the uprising , with some dissenters attacking government installations as well as stealing caches of weapons . \nThe central government lost control of Benghazi , with multiple witnesses reporting that protesters took over Libya 's second-largest city with support from some military who dropped their allegiance to Moammar Gadhafi . \nProtester : ` We want our basic rights ' However , his son continued to insist the military remained loyal to the ruling government and would be taking an increasingly active role in suppressing unrest in the coming days . \nThe reported power shift followed fresh clashes that left 25 dead earlier in the day , a doctor at Benghazi 's Al Jalla Hospital said . \nA source at Benghazi Medical Center , the city 's other major hospital , said there were 10 people dead there Sunday . \nOne man told CNN that uniformed troops opened fire on thousands of mourners as they passed through the streets during a funeral procession honoring those killed the previous day . \nProtesters later Sunday packed at least one car with explosives and sent it crashing into a compound wall at a military camp in the eastern city , eyewitnesses said . \nSecurity forces then fired on the protesters as they attempted to breach the camp . \nOn the camp 's southern side , meanwhile , protesters drove a tank from a nearby army base in another attempt to break in , witnesses said . \nThey have also obtained other weapons , the protester said . \nLibyan state television reported the camp has been defended , and that protesters were being warned on loudspeakers not to attack the compound . \nThe network called it an act of sabotage . \nThe protester said that the military camp is significant because it houses Gadhafi 's eastern palace . \n`` It 's a symbol of his dominance here , '' he said . \n`` And it 's the last symbol , basically . '' \nA protester said some fellow anti-government demonstrators had other weapons . \nSaif Gadhafi alluded to this claim in his speech early Monday , claiming criminal elements had stolen weaponry and even fired them in an attempt to cast blame on military and security forces . \nPeople said there was a food shortage in parts of Benghazi . \nThe internet remained down in the city and electricity was cut off for the second night in the row , but was back in the morning . \nOne man , a technology expert who has set up cameras airing live online video streams around Benghazi , estimated that the numbers of anti-government demonstrators in the city has grown by 20 % since the protests began Tuesday . \n`` There are a lot of people getting killed for their freedom , '' he said Sunday . \n`` Our goal is simple : We want Gadhafi to leave . \n... We want democracy . '' \nOthers in Libya reported similar protests in the cities of al-Baida , Ajdabiya and significantly in Misratah -- an indication that the demonstrations centered in the east may be spreading west . \nMeanwhile , the most significant unrest to date hit Moammar Gadhafi 's doorstep of Tripoli on Sunday . \nClashes broke out between a large crowd of demonstrators and people who appeared to be African mercenaries in the center of the city , according to an activist . \nElsewhere , hundreds of protesters were demonstrating in front of the courthouse , the activist said . \nBoth groups were calling for the downfall of the regime . \nA woman said she saw demonstrators running down a Tripoli street outside her window , chased by apparent mercenaries in pickup trucks . \nThe Africans were firing at the demonstrators and throwing tear gas at them , according to the witness . \nMany families have closed their windows and turned off their lights out of fear , she said . \nAnother witness said that crowds of anti-government demonstrators hit the streets and set cars on fire . \nMasked , armed men in SUVs drove through the streets blasting pro-government music , said the witness , claiming that the same people had been firing at protesters and passerby . \nGunfire also rang out near Green Square and the presidential palace , according to multiple witnesses . \nAnother man said that men were walking around Libya 's streets with automatic rifles early Monday , firing seemingly indiscriminately . \nThe crackdown , as well as the government 's role and reaction to it , stoked the ire of many opposed to Moammar Gadhafi as well as governments outside Libya . \nLibya 's ambassador to the Arab League said Sunday he resigned his position on Saturday over `` the killing of innocent people . '' \nAbdel Elhuni said the protesters are asking for `` normal things '' and that Gadhafi is `` over , finished . '' \nHe speculated that the Libyan leader has only a day or two left in power because `` he lost the people . '' \nBritish Foreign Secretary William Hague spoke on Sunday with Saif Gadhafi and `` made clear the U.K. 's grave concern at the escalation of violence , '' the Foreign Office said in a statement . \n`` He expressed alarm at reports of large numbers of people being killed or attacked by Libyan security forces . \nThe Foreign Secretary told Mr. Gadhafi that the Libyan government 's actions were unacceptable and would result in worldwide condemnation . '' \nThe United States also said it was `` gravely concerned with disturbing reports and images coming out of Libya . \n`` We are working to ascertain the facts , but we have received multiple credible reports that hundreds of people have been killed and injured in several days of unrest -- and the full extent of the death toll is unknown due to the lack of access of international media and human rights organizations , '' State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said in a statement . \nU.S. officials have communicated to Libyan officials including Libyan Foreign Minister Musa Kusa `` our strong objections to the use of lethal force against peaceful demonstrators , '' Crowley said . \n`` Libyan officials have stated their commitment to protecting and safeguarding the right of peaceful protest . \nWe call upon the Libyan government to uphold that commitment and hold accountable any security officer who does not act in accordance with that commitment . '' \nOne man in Tripoli said was particularly angry at state-run TV for `` pretending that nothing is happening . '' \nA medical staff member at Benghazi Medical Center was among those sharply critical of Saif Gadhafi 's speech , calling him a liar and saying -- disputing his assertion that Libya could split into several parts if not united under his father 's rule -- the nation was one . \n`` There are no divisions among Libyans , '' the staff member said . \n`` We want to be united with our brothers and sisters ...

'' \nHe added that both are showing incredible arrogance and disrespect for voters when suggesting that they would discuss between the two of them who should run for president in 2012 . \nGorbachev has been ever more outspoken in recent weeks in criticizing Russian leaders , saying he sees the country becoming increasingly entrenched in a dangerous , authoritarian system . \nIn an interview with a Russian newspaper he co-owns , Gorbachev said he was trying to start a new political party but has been blocked by the Kremlin . \nHe claims Kremlin bosses refuse to officially register and recognize his new social democratic party . \nGorbachev says Russia is in need of a democratic revival . \nMany Russians are ambivalent toward Gorbachev and his legacy . \nWhile many concede he brought real change to their lives with greater freedoms under Perestroika and with the dissolution of the Soviet Union , many also blame him for hardships that came afterward . \nMaxim Tkachenko contributed to this report . \n"}
{"id": "89", "time": "2011-02-21", "text": "The White House is `` analyzing '' the speech of Saif al-Islam Gadhafi to see `` what possibilities it contains for meaningful reform , '' a senior U.S. administration official said Sunday night after the Libyan leader 's son took to the airwaves to propose speedy implementation of significant democratic reforms following days of anti-government demonstrations . \nThe same source confirmed that President Barack Obama was monitoring the situation in Libya and `` considering all appropriate actions . '' \nThe increased violence seen this weekend has prompted the White house to seek `` clarification '' from senior Libyan officials , the source added . \n`` We continue to raise with -LRB- Libyan officials -RRB- the need to avoid violence against peaceful protesters and respect universal rights . '' \nThe terminology echoed an earlier statement from State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley . \nIn a speech on Libyan state television that he said was unscripted , Gadhafi warned of a civil war and mass poverty if citizens sided with anti-government demonstrators . \n`` Tomorrow , we can speak rationally , we can spare the blood , we can stand all together for the sake of Libya , '' he said . \nBut if the unrest continues , `` forget about democracy , forget about reform ... It will be a fierce civil war . '' \nEvents in Libya are very difficult to confirm , since the government maintains tight control on communications and has not responded to repeated CNN requests for access to the country . \nInside Libya , a local leader of the Muslim Brotherhood in the coastal city , Misurata , was unimpressed by Gadhafi 's speech . \n`` He is worse than his father , '' the leader said . \n`` His claims about the establishment of Islamic emirates in the country is not true at all . \n`` Despite our differences , Libyans are all one , '' he continued . \n`` They are all out on the streets against the regime . \nHe called the protesters unstable ! \nIt is the regime members who are not stable for spending the country 's wealth on petty things ! '' \nThe country 's second-largest city , Benghazi , has seen some of the bloodiest clashes since protests began . \nA staff member working at the Benghazi Medical Center said of Gadhafi : `` He is a liar . \nContrary to what Saif said , there are no divisions among Libyans . \nWe are proud to be free from this regime . \nWe have liberated the east of the country and we want to be united with our brothers and sisters in the east . \n... All Libyans think this way , it is the regime that lacks knowledge about the people . '' \nMeanwhile , a journalist working in the capital Tripoli said the speech caused further confusion . \n`` But most do not believe his talk of civil war , '' the journalist said . \n`` Earlier , thousands went to the streets chanting anti-government slogans calling on Gadhafi to leave the country . \nBut now after the speech some pro-government crowds gathered in the downtown area . '' \nHuman Rights Watch researcher Fred Abrahams said that he did n't believe the speech would placate crowds of people who are looking for change . \n`` There 's been so much resentment built up over four decades of rule , '' he said . \n`` Serious violations , disappearances , political killings , total restrictions on freedom of assembly , no free media , and corruption ... And those resentments bubble up from Libyans . '' \n"}

'' \nBut , he added , oil exports will likely continue after `` some '' interruption . \n`` It would be in the interest of all parties that oil keep flowing , '' he said , dismissing as unlikely any apocalyptic scenario in which Libya would descend into civil war . \nThe current uncertainty will likely be decided in the next few days , he predicted . \n`` It seems to me that we 're in an endgame here , '' he said . \n`` The big question is how much bloodshed we 're going to see . '' \nHe called the violence against unarmed civilians `` extraordinary , but not surprising from a regime that 's truly entrenched . '' \nThere are few candidates in the wings to replace Gadhafi -- `` no younger leadership able to assume that mantle of leadership , '' he said . \nBut Gadhafi 's imminent departure is not a foregone conclusion , he added , putting the odds at `` 80 % go , 20 % stay . '' \nRonald Bruce St John , who has written seven books on Libya , said Gadhafi 's reign appears to be drawing quickly to a close . \n`` He 's losing support by the hour from critical people in his regime , '' he said . \nBut St John said it was unlikely that the next leader would emerge from the military , since Gadhafi has long sought to keep the institution at arm 's length . \n`` Though he was an army officer when he came to power and was supported by the military and all the original members of the Revolutionary Command Council were from the military , he has , from the beginning , evidenced a great distrust for the military , '' St John said . \n`` He recognized it as the most likely power to overthrow him . '' \nAs a result , Gadhafi has routinely rotated commanders `` so no one established a base of support . '' \n"}

I vomited so much , '' said Ibrahim Cooper , 26 , also from Sierra Leone . \nDespite reports that a similar ship sank off the coast of Libya , killing at least 16 migrants , more than 30,000 migrants and refugees from Tunisia and Libya have risked this dangerous journey to Lampedusa since last February . \nLate Thursday night , Italian authorities were tracking one boat from Libya carrying 250 migrants that was said to be leaking . \nThat vessel is believed to now be in the territorial waters of Malta . \nPassengers onboard Friday morning 's boat said they made the journey to escape the fighting in Libya . \n`` It 's a war situation now , '' Abubakr said . \n`` Anything can happen . \nThat 's why we have to run for our lives . \nBecause we are blacks . \nWe are not secure in that country .

'' \nThe audio message was broadcast several times over the course of the day and expressed gratitude to people around the world who were concerned for his safety . \n`` Tell the crusader cowards that I live in a place you can not reach me , '' Gadhafi said . \nLibya 's combative leader also condemned Thursday 's attack that reportedly killed three people . \nGadhafi left this message to NATO : `` I live in the hearts of millions , and even if you kill my body , you can not kill my soul that lives in the hearts of millions . '' \nLibya 's expat freedom fighters train The audio message was released after the Italian foreign minister raised the possibility that the Libyan leader may have been injured after weeks of NATO airstrikes in the country . \nForeign Minister Franco Frattini said he did not have any evidence as to Gadhafi 's fate , but Monsignor Giovanni Martinelli , the Catholic archbishop of Tripoli , told him that Gadhafi was wounded , the Italian ANSA news agency reported . \nMartinelli said Gadhafi was most likely not in Tripoli anymore , Frattini said . \nHowever , Libyan government spokesman Musa Ibrahim said Friday that Ghadafi was in `` good health and high spirits '' in Tripoli . \nFour rockets struck Gadhafi 's Bab al-Aziziya compound Thursday and killed at least three people , according to a Libyan government official . \nThe Libyan government took journalists near the site of the blast , where smoke could be seen still rising from the compound . \nNATO military spokesman Mike Bracken said NATO had struck a command and control center but did not know whether anyone was inside . \nA top Libyan opposition leader urged formal U.S. recognition at the White House on Friday , one day after the interim council secured strong support from Britain . \nMahmoud Jibril , president of the Libyan Transitional National Council 's Executive Bureau , and his delegation met with top Obama administration officials . \nDuring the meeting , National Security Adviser Tom Donilon told the leader of the Libyan opposition group that the U.S. views the group `` as a legitimate and credible interlocutor of the Libyan people , '' according to a White House statement released after the Friday meeting . \nThe statement stopped short of formal recognition of the Transitional National Council . \nIn an interview on CNN 's `` Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer '' on Thursday , Jibril said his main message to Donilon in Friday 's meeting would be to clear up `` misperceptions '' about extreme elements in the opposition and ask for formal recognition . \nOfficials have said there are no plans to recognize the council out of concern of alienating Libyans that are not part of that group . \nThey do not anticipate recognizing any one group as the official group until there is an election in Libya , officials have said . \n`` Ultimately , of course , it will be the people of Libya , not the international community , who will choose their leadership . '' \nWhite House spokesman Jay Carney said Friday . \n`` But we do applaud the -LRB- council -RRB- for its commitment to a democratic future for Libya , '' Carney said . \nIn talks Thursday with the council 's chairman , Mustafa Abdul Jalil , British Prime Minister David Cameron invited the group to establish a formal office in London . \nCameron said Britain would also boost its presence in Benghazi , the de facto rebel capital . \nThe United States has not recognized the opposition formally , although it has provided aid . \nItaly and France have recognized the opposition group . \nAs the opposition sought greater support , the International Criminal Court at The Hague in the Netherlands said it will unveil Monday the names of those who are `` most responsible for crimes allegedly committed in Libya . '' \nThe names will be submitted to the court 's chief prosecutor , Luis Moreno-Ocampo , who has been seeking warrants for three individuals in crimes against humanity allegedly committed since February , when the Libyan uprising erupted . \nLibyan state television broadcast video late Wednesday that it said showed Gadhafi meeting with tribal elders in a Tripoli hotel , marking the strongman 's first public appearance in nearly two weeks . \nThe camera panned from a television program bearing the date of May 11 to the group of more than a dozen men , including Gadhafi . \nGadhafi , wearing sunglasses and dark clothing , had not been seen on television since April 30 , the same day a NATO airstrike hit the Tripoli compound reportedly housing him and one of his sons . \nLibyan officials said at the time that Saif al-Arab Gadhafi was killed but that his father had escaped . \nGadhafi has been firm in his attempt to retain power in Libya . \nLoyalist forces and rebel fighters , aided by NATO airstrikes , have been fighting each other for weeks . \nLibyan state television reported Friday that NATO airsrikes hit a guest house in the eastern oil town of al-Brega , killing 11 people and injuring about 45 others . \nIbrahim condemned the attack , calling NATO `` barbaric '' and inhumane '' in its actions for striking attendees of a religious conference while they were asleep . \nHe showed a video that showed the imams in prayer and then bodies being taken away . \n`` Now is this protection of civilians ? '' \n`` Is this legitimate under any Security Council resolution to kill people in their sleep ? '' \nNATO 's military office confirmed that NATO conducted an air strike in al-Brega earlier Friday but said the target was clearly identified as a command and control structure , which was being used by Gadhafi regime to coordinate attacks against the civilian population . \nAnd Ahmed Bani , a rebel military spokesman , denied that civilian casualties were caused by NATO strikes . \nAll civilians have left the al-Brega area , Bani said . \nThe remaining population are pro-Gadhafi forces and have taken up positions in civilian neighborhoods , hiding equipment and ammunition , he said . \nIn the contested western city of Misrata , a doctor said rebels were able to maintain control of the airport and a civil defense base beyond the airport . \nThe doctor said that at least 10 people , including two babies , were killed and at least 20 were injured Friday in sporadic shelling . \nA rebel spokesman , who asked to be identified only as Mohamed , also said rebels were controlling Misrata 's airport and civil defense base , which are about 17 kilometers -LRB- 10 miles -RRB- from the city center . \nIn Jibril 's first official visit to Washington , the opposition leader is scheduled to meet Friday with Donilon as well as other senior administration officials and members of Congress . \nJibril said Thursday that the United States should turn over some of Libya 's frozen assets to his group because `` a human tragedy is in the making right now . '' \nHe said Libyan rebels are facing a `` big hurdle '' in getting the U.S. government to free up some of the $ 30 billion-plus in frozen Libyan assets to help those suffering under Gadhafi 's regime . \n`` Time is the crux of the matter , because having solved this problem in a matter of four or five weeks might be too late , '' Jibril told a group gathered at the Brookings Institution . \nHe said he wanted to clarify a misunderstanding about the council : that it was not a political organ but an administrative one that was managing the situation in Libya until the fall of Gadhafi 's regime . \n`` The political question of who should rule Libya and how he or she should rule it , this is for the Libyan people to decide through a political democratic process based on constitutional grounds , based on an active civil society , based on equal rights and natural human rights for everybody , '' he said . \nIn March , Jibril met privately with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton when she was in Paris for a meeting with the Group of Eight foreign ministers . \nAt the State Department on May 5 , Clinton said , `` Clearly on our agenda is looking for the most effective ways to deliver financial assistance and other means of supporting and helping the opposition .

'' \nHuman Rights Watch called on the Transitional National Council to allow al-Obeidy to leave the country immediately . \nHRW added that an NTC spokesman had told the group that she was free to travel domestically and abroad . \nAl-Obeidy received worldwide attention on March 26 when she burst into the Rixos Hotel in Tripoli while international journalists staying there were having breakfast . \nShe told reporters she had been taken from a checkpoint east of Tripoli and held against her will for two days while being beaten and raped by 15 men . \nShe later fled Libya to Tunisia with the help of two defecting Gadhafi army officers and their families . \nFrench diplomats drove her from the border and handed her off to rebel officials -- members of the Transitional National Council -- who organized her flight to Qatar . \nShe was in Qatar awaiting resettlement as a refugee when she was deported . \nThe Office of the U.N.

'' \nA number of nongovernmental organizations said they were making efforts to get al-Obeidy out of Benghazi to a destination in Europe in the next few days . \nAfter arriving in Qatar , al-Obeidy made public statements saying the Transitional National Council -- the Libyan rebel leadership -- was using her . \nThe council denied that , but her presence in Qatar appears to have become an embarrassment to the organization . \nQatar 's government is allied with the rebels . \nThe UNHCR said it was seeking an explanation from Qatari authorities for al-Obeidy 's deportation . \nAn official at the Qatari Embassy in Washington asked CNN to e-mail questions about the deportation , but did not respond to them . \nCNN 's Khalil Abdallah and Tim Lister and Journalist Sherif Elhelwa contributed to this report . \n"}

'' \nIt said the airstrikes are failing to end the Libyan conflict , which was triggered by protests in February and an ensuing crackdown by Gadhafi 's forces . \nRussia , which has been critical of the airstrikes all along , has said normalization in Libya can come only from an immediate halt in military activities , the ministry said . \nSome have viewed the Libya campaign as a litmus test for relations between the alliance and Russia . \nThe 28 members of NATO work with Russia as equal partners in the NATO-Russia Council , a group that works on a wide array of issues , including security . \nObama , who met Wednesday in London with his British counterpart , David Cameron , increased pressure on Gadhafi by repeating that , ultimately , the embattled strongman must go . \nThe mission to protect Libyans from their leader means making sure Gadhafi `` does n't have capacity to send in a bunch of thugs to murder innocent civilians and threaten them , '' Obama said . \n`` I do think we have made enormous progress in Libya . \nWe have saved lives . \nGadhafi and his regime need to understand there will not be a letup in the pressure we are applying , '' Obama said . \nBut he and Cameron said it will take time to reach a solution in the North African country , ruled with an iron fist by Gadhafi for 42 years . \n`` We may have to be more patient than people would like , '' Obama said of the apparent stalemate . \nIn an effort to break the monthslong standoff , South Africa President Jacob Zuma plans to visit Tripoli next week for talks with Gadhafi , according to a statement on the South African leader 's website . \nZuma will meet Gadhafi Monday in `` his capacity as a member of the African Union high-level panel for the resolution of the conflict in Libya , '' the statement said . \nThe panel also includes Uganda and Mauritania . \nIt is the second such trip for Zuma , who was part of an African Union delegation that visited the nation last month . \nThat visit , which included talks on a cease-fire , did not succeed . \nThe Libyan government lashed out Wednesday at Obama and Cameron . \n`` It is illegal and illegitimate to speak about regime change under the pretext of protecting civilians , '' said a government official . \n`` It is up to the Libyan people to decide when and if Colonel Gadhafi should go -- not the U.S. and the U.K. '' Russia 's official RIA Novosti news agency reported that Gadhafi 's government may ask Moscow to mediate the conflict . \nMeanwhile , in Tripoli , daily life has become more onerous . \nOne woman said Wednesday that she had waited more than three days on line to get a half-tank of fuel for her car . \nThe woman said that , while waiting in the line on Tuesday night , she saw a man a few cars ahead of her reach the fuel pump and present his number to a police officer , who rejected it as fraudulent . \nWhen the man protested , the police officer fatally shot him , she said . \nWitnesses torched a police car in retaliation , she said . \nLife outside the capital also appears precarious . \nThe same woman said about three dozen Gadhafi soldiers on Saturday broke into her family 's farm near Zwara -- just east of the Tunisian border -- and moved in . \nOne of the soldiers told the farm caretaker they were taking over civilian properties to use as command posts and weapons storehouses because they feared being attacked by NATO if they were to use military facilities , said the woman , who asked not to be identified because she fears reprisal . \nA number of residents of the city of Yefren , about two hours southwest of Tripoli , had taken up residence in caves in order to avoid pro-Gadhafi forces , said an elderly man who cited safety concerns in declining to be identified . \nNearby residents avoid seeking help from Yefren 's hospital , he said . \n`` Any injured person who tries to enter the hospital is detained by the brigades , '' he said . \n`` We try to treat our wounded and give them first aid and protect them inside the mountain so they wo n't be killed or kidnapped by Gadhafi 's brigades .

'' \nAl-Obeidy told a journalist that officials in the Transitional National Council had pressured the Qataris to expel her . \nAl-Obeidy grabbed the world 's attention earlier this year when she accused Gadhafi 's security forces of gang-raping her . \nShe then fled Libya and was in Qatar awaiting resettlement as a refugee when she was deported Thursday to Benghazi . \nA high-level U.S. State Department source said Sunday al-Obeidy had left Libya and was on the way to Malta with her father . \nAl-Obeidy , who is being accompanied by a U.N.

'' \n... clearly the continuing pounding he is taking , the isolation , is all having an effect . \nThe entire international community is basically saying he 's got to go , a lot of sanctions -LRB- are -RRB- in place , the bombing continues against his forces . \n`` The opposition has been able to not only hold where they are in the east , they 've been able to expand their security area around the coastal city of Misrata , and the guys in the west are holding their own , '' Gates added . \n`` So I guess my forecast could be that it 's only a matter of time . \nI do n't think anybody knows how long , but I think we see signs the regime is getting shakier by the day and it 's just a question of when everybody around Gadhafi decides that it 's time to throw in the towel , and throw him under the bus .

Gen. Charles Bouchard of Canada , who commands the Libya operation . \nJournalists later visited a hospital where they reported they saw the bodies of three men , at least two covered in dust , and a number of injured people . \nCNN did not go on the hospital visit because of safety concerns . \nOn Monday , forces loyal to Gadhafi attacked a rebel-held border crossing into Tunisia in a battle that resulted in nine deaths , according to the rebels ' military commander in Zintan , Hajj Osama . \nHe said Gadhafi infantry who attacked rebels controlling the border post suffered eight fatalities ; one rebel fighter was killed . \nFood and fuel are shipped into Libya and wounded rebels are taken out for medical treatment via the crossing , which is literally a lifeline to the rebels , the rebel commander said . \nSince they were driven from the border checkposts by rebels more than two weeks ago , Gadhafi 's troops have been shelling the rebels ' nearby mountaintop holdouts to try to regain control of this vital artery . \nIn the towns of Yefren and Algalaa , southwest of Tripoli , only about 1,000 residents remained of the usual population of 22,000 , said a local person who is in touch with rebels there . \nThe military commander in Zintan , near the border with Tunisia , corroborated those numbers . \nThey contrast with figures issued by the Libyan Committee for Humanitarian aid and Relief , which said 22,000 to 25,000 people remained trapped in the two towns , and that about 40,000 others had been displaced to other towns in the Nafusa Mountains , Tripoli and Tunisia . \nFor the past two months , the towns ' dwindling numbers of residents have been enduring spartan living conditions -- without electricity or fuel and with only limited access to water , since Gadhafi forces control the region 's water wells and have contaminated some of them with oil , the committee said . \nBanks in Yefren and Algalaa have been closed since February 17 , which has led to a widespread shortage of cash , it added . \nThe cities ' main water tank has been out of commission since it was damaged six weeks ago by missiles and no food supplies have entered the area since March 1 , it said . \nSnipers loyal to Gadhafi control access to the hospital in Yefren and most doctors have fled , it added . \nIn other NATO efforts against Gadhafi forces Monday , an airstrike hit a Libyan army position outside the rebel town of Jadu in the western mountains , rebels in Zintan told CNN . \nThe attack took place around noon -LRB- 6 a.m. ET -RRB- , shortly after the Gadhafi forces at that position had launched Grad rockets into the rebel-held town , rebels said . \nNATO reported Monday that since its operation began on March 31 , it has flown 7,870 sorties , including 3,025 strike sorties , which are intended to identify and engage targets , but do not necessarily deploy munitions . \nOn Sunday , a command-and-control center was hit near Tripoli and a missile support facility was struck near Al Khums , NATO said in a news release . \nNear Sirte , an ammunition storage facility was struck and , near Brega , a command-and-control facility was targeted , it said . \nA spokesman for France 's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said France plans to add attack helicopters to the country 's arsenal in Libya , saying the aircraft would make `` more precise '' strikes possible . \nMedia reports said Britain also plans to use attack helicopters . \nA spokesman for Britain 's Ministry of Defense said only that , `` As with any military campaign , we are constantly reviewing our options alongside allies to enhance the capabilities available to NATO .

'' \nHuman Rights Watch called on the Transitional National Council to allow al-Obeidy to leave the rebel-controlled area of Libya immediately . \nThe New York-based activist group added that a rebel group spokesman had told the group that she was free to travel domestically and abroad . \nAl-Obeidy said that the council has warned her not to do any more television interviews or it would hurt her chances of leaving Libya . \nAl-Obeidy received worldwide attention on March 26 when she burst into the Rixos Hotel in Tripoli while international journalists staying there were having breakfast . \nShe told reporters she had been taken from a checkpoint east of Tripoli and held against her will for two days while being beaten and raped by 15 men . \nShe was forcibly taken out of the hotel by security forces in a scuffle that was captured by television cameras . \nShe was not heard from again for more than a week as Gadhafi 's representatives said they were investigating her claim . \nThen on April 4 , she spoke to CNN 's Anderson Cooper by phone about the alleged rapes . \n`` They had my hands tied behind me and they had my legs tied and they would hit me while I was tied and bite me in my body . \nAnd they would pour alcohol in my eyes so that I would not be able to see and they would sodomize me with their rifles and they would not let us go to the bathroom . \nWe were not allowed to eat or drink , '' she said , speaking through a translator . \n`` One man would leave and another would enter . \nHe would finish and then another man would come in , '' al-Obeidy said . \nShe later fled Libya to Tunisia with the help of two defecting Gadhafi army officers and their families . \nFrench diplomats drove her from the border and handed her off to rebel officials -- members of the Transitional National Council -- who organized her flight to Qatar . \nAfter arriving in Qatar , al-Obeidy made public statements saying the Transitional National Council was using her . \nThe council denied that , but her presence in Qatar appears to have become an embarrassment to the organization . \nQatar 's government is allied with the rebels . \nCNN 's Khalil Abdallah and Tim Lister and Journalist Sherif Elhelwa contributed to this report . \n"}

Security Council resolution of March 17 , which calls for `` all necessary measures to protect civilians under threat of attack '' in the North African country . \nHague told reporters in Brussels , Belgium , that `` a huge amount has been achieved in Libya , but clearly there is more to be done . '' \nJuppe said NATO needs to fully embrace the role it accepted -- to protect Libyan civilians from Gadhafi 's forces . \n`` NATO wanted to take charge of the military operations , we accepted it , '' Juppe said on France Info radio . \n`` It has to carry out its role today , which means to prevent Gadhafi from using heavy weapons to bombard the population . '' \nSpecifically , Juppe mentioned the attacks on Misrata , where on Monday at least five civilians -- including two toddlers , a 75-year-old man and an Algerian worker -- were killed and more than 20 people wounded in mortar attacks , according to witnesses . \nIn Benghazi , Abdel Hafiz Ghoga , the deputy chairman of the Transitional National Council , issued an `` urgent statement '' calling on the international community `` to intervene and stop the massacres that Gadhafi promised in Misrata , and to implement the UN resolution in any possible means . '' \nGhoga told CNN that the opposition has submitted a wish list of military equipment to Qatar and France . \nHe said the list was compiled by rebel military leaders and he did n't know exactly what was being requested . \nLast week , when asked by CNN 's Reza Sayah which countries were providing rebels with weapons and training , Ghoga said , `` We are in communication with our brothers in Qatar and also with our brothers in the Egyptian republic and with our friends in Italy and France . '' \nHe indicated in the interview that the weapons were on their way to Libya . \nMeanwhile , Libya 's most high-profile defector flew from Britain to Qatar Tuesday for talks on how to break the deadly impasse in his nation . \nFormer Libyan Foreign Minister Moussa Koussa flew to the Qatari capital , Doha , to meet with government officials and Libyan opposition leaders ahead of the first meeting Wednesday of the Libya Contact Group , formed in London last month and charged with implementing United Nations resolutions . \nU.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon will also attend . \nIn a news conference in Benghazi , Ghoga did not explicity reject the idea of opposition leaders ' meeting with Koussa in Doha , but said such a meeting was `` not on the agenda . '' \nIn an earlier interview with the BBC , Koussa had expressed concern that the situation in Libya was spiraling downward into a grinding war , in the mold of the conflict in Somalia . \nKoussa , who fled Libya last month and sought safe haven in Britain after resigning his post in Gadhafi 's regime , urged all parties to avoid plunging Libya into a civil war . \n`` This will lead to -LRB- much bloodshed -RRB- , and Libya will be a new Somalia , '' Koussa told the BBC . \nKoussa , a longtime Gadhafi confidant and a former Libyan intelligence chief , also told BBC , `` The solution in Libya will come from the Libyans themselves through discussion and democratic dialogue . '' \ndid not explicitly reject the idea of meeting with Libya 's held a press conference on Tuesday and when asked if the opposition would be open to a meeting with Moussa Koussa - Libya 's former Foreign Minister - in Doha , the Deputy Chairman of the Transitional National Council did not explicitly reject the idea . \nHe told reporters a meeting with Moussa Koussa in Doha `` was not on the agenda . '' \nAn African Union attempt at forging peace fell flat when Ghoga and fellow rebel leader Mustafa Abdul Jalil rejected it on grounds that it did not provide any solutions to violence against the Libyan people . \nGadhafi had agreed in principle to stop hostilities and allow outside forces to help keep the peace , his government and African Union mediators said Monday in a joint statement after a meeting in Tripoli . \nThe African Union plan announced Monday did not address whether Gadhafi will step down , nor is it binding . \nAccording to the memorandum detailed by Ramtane Lamara , the African Union 's commissioner for peace and security , the plan had four elements : -- An immediate end to all fighting -- Libyan authorities ' cooperation `` to facilitate the diligent delivery of humanitarian assistance '' -- The protection of foreign nationals in Libya -- The start of talks involving various Libyan authorities , including opposition figures , with the aim of setting up `` an inclusive transition period '' to adopt and implement `` political reforms necessary for the elimination of the causes of the current crisis . '' \nU.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Monday that Washington is still `` waiting to get a full readout '' from participants in the African Union 's peace mission in Libya . \n`` We 've made it very clear that we want to see a cease-fire , '' Clinton said . \nBut she said there also must be , among other things , a resumption of water , electricity and other services to Libyan cities that have been `` brutalized by Gadhafi 's forces . '' \nShe also reiterated the U.S. position that Gadhafi needs to step down from power . \nGhoga , the Transitional National Council 's deputy chairman , on Tuesday said rebel forces were `` fighting in the direction of Brega '' from the western gate of the `` completely liberated '' city of Ajdabiya . \n`` Gadhafi 's forces still have some elements in Brega , '' he told reporters . \n`` We added more security personnel to protect the oil fields in the city because the regime is trying to strand us economically . '' \n`` The situation in Tripoli is very dire , '' Ghoga continued . \nHe said fuel and food there were depleted `` because all fuel is being for the Gadhafi forces ' need -LRB- s -RRB- . '' \nGhoga also claimed that `` thousands of demonstrators '' opposing the regime were arrested in the capital and that `` a large number of them were executed in the Saladin military academy , '' but did n't provide further details . \nCNN could not independently confirm those claims . \nHe added that on Monday , `` there was a massive demonstration in Fashloum in Tripoli , and the majority were hiding their faces , fearing arrest .

{"id": "392", "time": "2011-04-12", "text": "In this Q&A , CNN 's Fareed Zakaria reminds us that a de facto partition of Libya is better than a Gadhafi-ruled country , and he explains why foreign policy can not be applied consistently across vastly different countries . \nAmar C. Bakshi : How do you see us getting out of the stalemate in Libya ? \nFareed Zakaria : I think that the mistake would be to say we re in a stalemate and the way we re going to get out is by keeping ratcheting up military force , because that just gets us more deeply and deeply committed in an area and with an issue where everyone agrees our interests are limited . \nHow do we get out of the stalemate ? \nWe keep the pressure on : We push for diplomatic and political solutions . \nThis is not a great life for him . \nAnd so you ve got to hope that at some point he realizes that . \nWorst case scenario : the status quo is not so bad for the United States . \nIt s not particularly expensive . \nWe maintained a much more robust no-fly zone over Iraq for 10 years or so . \nPeople say , Well , it may mean the de facto partition of Libya ? \nWell , so be it . \nI mean , it s not particularly clear to me why a partitioned Libya is worse than a Libya run by a Gadhafi . \nIf you want to be very cynical , you could say for a consumer of oil like the United States having lots of little oil producing countries is better than having a few big ones . \nOn GPS this past Sunday you talked with former U.S. Secretary of State and Treasury James Baker about the U.S. intervention Libya -LRB- see video above and transcript here -RRB- . \nWhat struck you most about this interview ? \nWhat I was struck by was how uncomfortable James Baker was with the Libyan operation but how he seemed to recognize that he probably would have found himself backed into the same position Obama was . \nHere s a guy who was really a pretty steely-eyed realist who was very uncomfortable with the idea of an open-ended humanitarian intervention . \nBut when we talked about how the Libyan opposition begged for it , the Arab League surprisingly and for the first time in 60 years endorsed it , the UN approved it with the Russians and Chinese abstaining , and the Europeans - France and Britain - pleaded with the Americans to help , it would have been pretty tough to say no. . \nAnd so it just gave me a sense of the dilemma that Obama is in . \nIt s all very well to say - as Richard Haass has said on GPS - that Obama should have just stuck it out and said `` No , no , no. '' But when you re in that situation and it s your closest allies there that are asking and the Arab street is asking for it - even James Baker sort of ended up saying , yeah , I probably would have had to go in , but let s keep it very limited . \nAnd I think that is what Obama is doing . \nHe went in clearly reluctantly and he s trying to keep it very limited , so I think that the trick will be in maintaining that discipline of staying limited while all of us in the media are going to clamor for action to solve the problem and win against Gadhafi because we view it as a game of chicken . \nWe want to see Gadhafi blink . \nViolence is mounting in Syria . \nWhat should the United States do in Syria ? \nI think that in the case of Syria , it is n't such a bad thing for there to be instability . \nIt is n't such a bad thing for the regime to be on edge . \nThere is n't an easy path for the United States to do anything . \nI think when people say we have to be consistent everywhere , this is nuts . \nYou re never consistent in foreign policy . \nYou ca n't be . \nThe circumstances are different . \nEach country is different . \nIn the case of Libya , you had a Libyan opposition that had wrested control from Gadhafi of several key cities , had tried to create a kind of alternate government and was requesting a limited form of Western military intervention . \nNone of that is happening in Syria . \nWhat you have is street protests that are being put down . \nNow if something similar were to happen in Syria where one part of the country was somehow to effectively try to secede and would be under the control of rebel groups and they were to come to the West and ask for some help - that would pose an interesting and difficult dilemma . \nI would say that in all of these cases my attitude has been we should support them economically , politically - we should stand with them - but using military power is a very , very dangerous game . \nYou re inserting yourself into these very complex political struggles and you start taking ownership for the resulting political situation in those countries . \nYou start taking ownership for those countries . \nColin Powell s great line about the Pottery Barn Rule - you break it you buy it - there s some truth to that . \nThe more you insert yourself militarily in these countries , the more you have to accept responsibility for the outcome . \nI should point out by the way that Pottery Barn insists that they do not have a rule like that and that , you know , people should feel free to To break what they want ? \nWell , if people do break things they are not going to be forced to buy them in the Pottery Barn . \nI ve never tested that theory . \nProbably now the partition of Libya is the best thing that can happen as long as it stops the bloodshed , thanks to NATO ! \nThe West also has a moral obligation to drop it 's demand for a regime change there ! \nApril 12 , 2011 at 3:42 pm | Reply Moral obligation ? \nTell me the honest truth here -- have you seen what Gaddafi has done -- as has been reported in the international media , not just on CNN ? \nDo you really think \\* any solution \\* that allows that thug to keep power will be `` moral '' ?

April 12 , 2011 at 11:45 pm | Here 's an idea , stop getting involved in a country that is having a civil war just because you want the oil to flow to Europe . \nStrange how the UN and US did nothing when North Korea killed innocent people on the ship they hit with a torpedo or the people they shelled on South Korean land . \nOh yeah , no oil there . \nAlso nothing was done with Iran who is building nukes and said they will take out isreal with it and kill everyone . \nOh yeah , we do n't start with tough ones . \nOr China cracking down on protesters , killing them , and having tons of human rights violations . \nOh yeah , we will send them an angry letter . \nIn Africa they are killing each other by the thousands and even in Mexico but no oil there . \nHowever , in Libya we have to get this ruler out . \nI guess it was ok to blame Bush for going for oil in Iraq even though Sadam used poison gas to kills tens of thousands and this guy only killed a few hundred . \nThis is for humanitarian purposes and wake up people , the `` UN '' is made up of like 40 % US forces . \nIt is our troops and planes doing the shooting not just NATO . \nHow stupid is this country ? \nApril 12 , 2011 at 11:36 pm | Reply you know you should really research the whole situation before opening your mouth . \nIf you launch a war against NK because of those incidents the ensuing war would result in the destruction of both NK and SK because of their close proximity . \nAlso you do realize that even with the military capacity of the US it still cant be everywhere at once . \nMexico we attempt to deal with but with a semi-failed government there is n't much that can be done short of invasion . \nThe bloodshed in the other African countries did n't really spark Arab league request for UN support nor did they spark requests for US support . \nIt is just plain ignorant for you to assume it 's about oil , if we were there for oil why are n't the US ground troops in yet ? \nWhy are we supporting rebel groups that are rumored to have affiliations with Al-Queda ? \nIt 's not always so black and white you ignorant prick . \nApril 13 , 2011 at 2:38 am | No , what 's strange is your glaring omission that N.

'' \nA Sudanese man who crossed into Tunisia said Libyans had been confiscating phones and SIM cards of people fleeing . \nHe said people are afraid to make the journey because of the fighting and the cost for bus or taxi transport to the border has spiked . \nHowever , he said , Libyans are not stopping traffic toward border . \nRaoul Gernali , a Filipino engineer who had been working on a Libyan water project , said Libyan soldiers at the Tunisian border stole his laptop , money and mobile phone . \nBecause of complications with his group 's flight home , he and his Filipino colleagues have had to spend three days at the airport . \nMany countries , such as India and China , put in place well-organized evacuation operations for their citizens . \nBut others , including Egyptians and Bangladeshis , have been left to fend for themselves . \nThe U.S. State Department said Saturday it would donate $ 3 million to the International Organization for Migration -LRB- IOM -RRB- as part of a joint U.S.-IOM partnership to help get home thousands of Egyptians and other nationals from Africa , South Asia and Southeast Asia . \nKayal said more than 10,000 Bangladeshis are awaiting transport in Tunisia . \nMany Bangladeshis have had to walk to the border because their money was stolen by soldiers and they could not pay for transportation costs . \nOne man suffered a heart attack and died , aid officials confirmed . \n"}

'' \n15 reported killed in Zawiya , Libya ` Awful ' conditions along Libyan border No-fly zone in Libya explained Tired , filthy and stuck at border As of Thursday , more than 172,000 people had left Libya , most of them migrant workers returning home , the U.N. 's emergency relief coordinator , Valerie Amos , said in a statement issued Friday . \nAmong them were women and children , she said . \nThe United Nations ' figure was slightly less than that of the International Organization for Migration , which has been working with the U.N. refugee agency and estimated that 200,000 people had fled Libya . \nSome of those crossing the border told CNN that government forces in Tripoli had confiscated their mobile phones and cameras . \nA majority of those fleeing are Egyptians who had been working in Libya . \nBut the foreign workers also include citizens of other nations including Bangladesh , Thailand , Vietnam , Sudan , Ghana and Mali . \nA U.S. Agency for International Development official said approximately 90,000 people were in transit camps over the Libyan border in Tunisia . \nAlmost half of them are Egyptian , said the official , who did not want to be identified because he was not authorized to speak on the record . \nCloser to the Egyptian border , in the eastern city of Benghazi , about 8,000 foreigners awaited evacuation . \nThey included Eritreans , Ethiopians and Somalis , according to the refugee agency . \n`` They appear to have gathered spontaneously and are camping together for security as they await , '' refugee agency spokeswoman Melissa Fleming said in a statement . \nShe said most of those people will be evacuated within two days . \nWho is the opposition in Libya ? \nRefugees flee Libya for Tunisia Another 110,000 people inside Libya have been affected by the crisis , the International Committee of the Red Cross said Friday . \nIt appealed for $ 26 million to help those inside the country and those in Tunisia . \nThe agency said it will use the money for food , water , medical care , sanitation and hygiene items . \nAs the violence has escalated in the past few days , U.S. military aircraft and French charter jets have scrambled to evacuate tens of thousands from the north African nation . \nIn Washington , President Barack Obama said he has approved the use of U.S. military aircraft to help Egyptians who have fled the unrest to return home . \nHe said he authorized the U.S. Agency for International Development to charter additional planes . \n`` Tens of thousands of people from many different countries are fleeing Libya , and we commend the governments of Tunisia and Egypt for their response , even as they go through their own political transitions , '' Obama said . \nThe Pentagon announced that two planes carrying humanitarian supplies were being dispatched Friday to Tunisia in what has been dubbed Operation Odyssey Dawn ; the planes were carrying blankets , rolls of sheeting and water cans . \nCNN learned that a C-130 cargo plane labeled with a U.S. flag landed in Tunisia . \nBadreddine stood in the departure hall of an airport that normally welcomes sun-hungry European tourists traveling to the wind-swept beaches of Djerba 's Mediterranean coast . \nInstead , the hall was filled with hundreds of tired and dirty migrant workers . \nSome camped out on the floor on blankets . \nOthers stood in orderly lines in front of a booth normally reserved for car rental companies and money exchange , which instead held Tunisian volunteers distributing sandwiches , fruit and water to the arrivals . \n`` Of the 50,000 refugees who have come through here '' since the crisis began , Badreddine said , `` everybody has been given shelter and food at the airport . '' \nThe conditions at the airport were dramatically better than the scene that awaited many migrants immediately after entering Tunisia from Libya . \nOn Thursday , more than 5,000 Bangladeshi men were camped out in a vacant lot next to the border gate , huddled under blankets next to a fetid pond of muddy water as howling winds whipped dust through the compound . \nTunisian authorities and volunteers distributed food and water . \nA tent city that serves as a transit center was erected this week some 10 kilometers from the border . \nBut the camp can hold only some 15,000 people -- that 's how many people are estimated to have arrived in a single day and not near enough to accommodate all those in need . \nStill , conditions have improved dramatically since Wednesday , when Libyan authorities began regulating the flow of refugees across the border . \nInstead of allowing them to mass by the thousands in front of the Tunisian border gate , refugees must now approach the border with Tunisia in orderly groups in single file . \nThe U.N. refugee agency said Friday that the number of civilians fleeing the violence in Libya to Tunisia `` has dropped significantly since Wednesday afternoon , '' with armed , pro-government forces manning the Libyan side . \nCompared with earlier in the week , when 10,000 to 15,000 people were crossing daily into Tunisia , fewer than 2,000 made it across on Thursday and about the same number did so on Friday , the agency said . \nThe U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said it was `` very concerned that the security situation in Libya may be preventing people from fleeing . '' \nThe Libyan government appeared eager to show off the orderly border . \nOfficials bused in a group of foreign journalists from Tripoli Thursday afternoon as part of a guided tour of the frontier region . \nBut , upon their arrival in Egypt , dozens of refugees have said they had been robbed at Libyan checkpoints . \nMany said that , as they sought to get out of Libya , they were stopped and searched by Libyan security forces who confiscated their cell phones and computers . \nMany refugees also accused Libyan police and soldiers of having robbed them at gunpoint . \n`` I have no passport , only a passport photocopy , '' said Mohammed Shafiq al Islam . \nThe 29-year-old man sat on the floor of the airport with more than 100 Bangladeshis -- all of them awaiting a flight home . \nHe wore a uniform labeled `` Hanil , '' the name of the supply company that paid him $ 250 a month to work in Libya . \n`` The Libyan people take my money and passport and all the time say ' I will kill you , I will kill you , ' '' al Islam said , speaking in broken English . \n`` I am run away -LRB- for -RRB- my life . '' \nLike many Bangladeshi migrant workers , al Islam had borrowed some $ 4,000 to pay employment agencies to give him a job in Libya . \nUpon their arrival in Libya , many migrant workers were forced to hand over their passports to their employers . \nHuman rights groups have denounced such practices , arguing they amount to little more than indentured servitude . \nThe flight back to Bangladesh for al Islam and his fellow migrants will be free , but he and many of his fellow Bangladeshis face crushing debts . \n`` We are very helpless now ; we are beggars now , '' al Islam said . \nDjerba airport officials said 25 flights were scheduled to take off Friday for Cairo . \nThe French government has helped with the Egyptian airlift by chartering several passenger planes to Cairo . \nA number of charter flights are scheduled as well to India , Jordan , China , Vietnam and Dubai . \n"}

'' \nThe woman said she has been trying to smuggle medication and other supplies into Libya , and that 's one reason she refuses to leave -- even though so far , she said her efforts have been unsuccessful . \nThe strife engulfing the besieged north African nation is reverberating across the country , the region and the world . \nDeath toll estimates range from more than 1,000 to as many as 2,000 , and the international community has been pondering strategies on how to end the violence and remove the Gadhafi regime . \nThe government has been reviled across the globe for violence against civilians , and the International Criminal Court this week launched an investigation of Gadhafi , some of his sons and other leaders for possible crimes against humanity . \nOpposition-controlled radio announced Saturday that the country 's sole legitimate representative was now the National Transitional Council , a group with 31 representatives for most of the regions in Libya . \nThe council held its first meeting Saturday in the eastern city of Benghazi . \nThey called Benghazi their temporary location until the `` liberation '' of the capital , according to a decree the council issued late in the day . \nFormer Justice Minister Mustafa Abdeljeleel , whom the council said had tried to resign from Gadhafi 's government several times , was announced as the council 's new leader . \nThe council also named a representative for military affairs and established a military council to oversee the `` liberation '' of Libya and reconstruct the armed forces , according to the radio announcement . \nThe council said its main missions are to represent all of Libya internationally , liberate the country , draft a constitution and hold elections . \nIn Benghazi , witnesses said forces loyal to Gadhafi pounded a weapons depot , an airstrike that caused casualties and widespread damage . \nOne witness said the airstrike there was powerful enough `` to destroy a whole city . '' \nNews footage showed the remains of buildings and debris and ambulances arriving . \nSuch aerial attacks have prompted the West to step up discussions about imposing a no-fly zone over Libya . \nU.S. military and diplomatic officials have said such a zone would be complicated and risky , and international support for it is not strong . \n`` If it 's ordered , we can do it , '' U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said earlier this week , but imposing a no-fly zone `` begins with an attack on Libya to destroy the air defenses . '' \nThe Arab League has rejected international intervention , saying Libya is facing `` an internal affair that is decided by the people and their governments . '' \nHowever , the league can not ignore the suffering of civilians and would consider the imposition of a no-fly zone in coordination with the African Union if fighting were to continue , said Hisham Yousef , chief of staff of the Arab League , on Wednesday . \nThe fierce fighting has sparked the flight of Libyans and foreigners out of Libya , with nations across the globe scrambling to help people leave . \nAlmost 200,000 people have fled Libya with nearly equal numbers going to Tunisia and Egypt , the United Nations refugee agency said . \nThe United States announced Saturday it is contributing $ 3 million to the International Organization for Migration to help return home thousands of non-Libyans who fled to Tunisia . \nFour U.S. military flights Saturday were taking a total of 312 Egyptians back to Cairo , the U.S. State Department announced . \nThursday and Friday , about 1,800 people crossed from Libya to Tunisia , and about 3,000 crossed on Saturday , said Firas Kayal , spokesman for the U.N.

'' \nA few thousand Egyptians are in Tunisia awaiting travel home , and more than 10,000 Bangladeshis are there awaiting evacuation with hundreds more still arriving , Kayal said . \nThe agency confirmed that a Bangladeshi migrant worker died after a heart attack from the exhaustion of walking to the border . \nMany migrant workers told aid workers they had to walk to the border because soldiers took their money and they could n't afford paying for a taxi . \nCNN 's Ben Brumfield , Arwa Damon , Ben Wedeman , Salma Abdelaziz , Jomana Karadsheh , Nic Robertson and Jill Dougherty contributed to this report \n"}
{"id": "295", "time": "2011-03-02", "text": "By Nic Robertson , CNN senior international correspondent Is opposition waning in Tripoli ? \nUntil the leadership is overthrown , then Tripoli is where the tipping point will need to happen It appears at the moment that both sides are heading for a stalemate If talks can progress in rebel-controlled Zawia and Misrata it could provide incentive for other areas The government is feeling international and domestic pressure but it is also a diehard leadership Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In Libya , the rivals for power appear to be heading towards a stalemate . \nCNN 's Nic Robertson explains what 's happening in the capital , Tripoli , why two cities in rebel control could be key to the country 's future , and why neither side has the power to dislodge the other completely . \nWhat 's it like on the streets of Tripoli ? \nWe have seen about three rings of security around the capital . \nThey include Army checkpoints with armored personnel carriers , anti-aircraft batteries and tanks . \nBut there are not that many soldiers around and they do n't stop many vehicles . \nThey are more interested in vehicles coming into the city than those leaving it . \nOn the streets in the outskirts where we know there have been anti-government protests we saw some police in armored vehicles and riot gear . \nBut we are talking about a couple of dozen at any one location . \nAt street intersections there might be a couple of soldiers or police armed with automatic weapons but it is not a complete lockdown of every street . \nThe traffic passes through and they are not stopping people . \nHow willing are people to talk to you ? \nFuel truck causes blasts in Tripoli Quiet but not normal in Tripoli For rebels , a long road to Tripoli Some people , as soon as they see the camera , they come up and tell us how much they love Gadhafi but if you engage in conversation you can scratch the surface and they will tell you they want reforms . \nOften you hear the chant or people saying `` miya miya '' which means they are 100 percent for Gadhafi . \nOthers may not want to share their opinions but it is clear they are not happy with the situation or the government . \nYet others are brave to explain their positions . \nOne man who came up to me took me into his confidence . \nHe said they had tried anti-government protests and thought they were doing well , but now they 've been so badly beaten and forced off the streets that they are afraid to come out again . \nIs Gadhafi 's message resonating with Libyans ? \nThere is an uneducated population that will go with their tribe . \nIf the tribe says `` go with Gadhafi '' then they support Gadhafi . \nGovernment officials will tell you a good part of the population will follow the tribe . \nIt is not a developed society . \nIt 's tribal and basic and people are not taught to analyze for themselves . \nWhen you speak to the more middle class people they take it with more of a pinch of salt . \nBut a lot of these people are worried by how the protests developed . \nI talked to a lawyer who said he protested the regime but when he saw weapons in the hands of protesters he felt the protest was being hijacked . \nThese people have a lot at stake -- their kids ' education , their businesses or professional reputations . \nThey are worried that violent protests threaten stability . \nThey want change but do not want it through violent means . \nThere were others , intellectuals among them , who think they have to really pressure the regime to make the change . \nCan the protesters in other parts of the country affect what happens in Tripoli ? \nProtesters in Benghazi can come out on the streets but it will not change anything in Tripoli . \nUntil the leadership is overthrown in Tripoli , then Tripoli is where the tipping point will need to happen . \nBut they can make a difference by organizing politically to either negotiate with the government or to build international pressure . \nAnd they can organize militarily to move forces and try to take the capital . \nBut that is not going to happen anytime soon . \nIn a place like Zawia the center is controlled by the opposition but they are surrounded by government forces . \nThe more they engage the military the more it stretches the government but it does not appear they are doing that . \nWe are in a stand off . \nThere is no pressure point where the opposition can push through . \nWhat do the options seem to be at the moment for how this will play out ?

Crowley told reporters . \nThe senior U.S. official said the fax from Libya was not an official diplomatic note and until State Department lawyers review its authenticity , `` Ambassador Aujali continues to be the head of mission at this time . '' \nAt the Libyan Embassy on Tuesday , Aujali greeted a delegation of U.S. House members led by Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas who came for a visit as a few dozen anti-Gadhafi protesters chanted on the street . \nAfterwards , Jackson Lee said she and her colleagues would try to ensure that the U.S. government continues to recognize Aujali to be `` the representative of the Libyan people . '' \nShe praised Aujali for condemning the Gadhafi regime , saying that , `` In jeopardy of his life , he has been willing to stand with those who fight . '' \nAujali asked for support from the United States . \n`` Please stand with us to change this regime , to stop the killing of the Libyan people which is taking place every day , '' he said , later adding : `` This regime is a brutal regime . \nThe slogan of the regime is , ' I rule you or I kill you . ' '' \nAs Jackson Lee 's delegation prepared to get in vehicles to leave , they were surrounded by demonstrators who wanted to shake their hands and hug them . \nWe stand with the people of Libya , '' Jackson Lee repeated over and over amid a barrage of embraces . \n"}

Security Council has not authorized the use of armed force . \nThe U.N. General Assembly adopted by consensus a resolution to suspend Libya from its seat on the 47-member chamber Human Rights Council . \nIt was the first time the assembly had suspended a member of the council . \n`` This is a harsh rebuke -- but one that Libya 's leaders have brought down upon themselves , '' said Ambassador Susan E. Rice , U.S. permanent representative to the United Nations , in a statement . \nU.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the General Assembly that he welcomed the decision and urged the international community to investigate allegations of human rights violations in Libya . \n`` The world has spoken with one voice , '' he said . \n`` We demand an immediate end to the violence toward civilians and full respect for their fundamental human rights , including those of peaceful assembly and free speech .

'' \n`` The death toll from nearly two weeks of violence is unknown , but likely to exceed 1,000 , '' with thousands more wounded , Ban said , using the same fatality figure he had used Friday . \nLibya 's ambassador to the United States estimated Monday that the death toll was about 2,000 . \nBut Gates stressed the number of casualties is uncertain . \n`` I think the honest answer is that we do n't know , '' he told reporters . \nThe government of Canada has frozen $ 2.3 billion in assets tied to the Libyan government ; the assets were frozen after Canada enacted sanctions over the weekend , Canadian Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Lynn Meahan said Tuesday . \nA number of other countries , including the United States , have ordered an asset freeze . \nThough some witnesses have accused pro-Gadhafi forces of firing on civilians from the air , Gates and Michael Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , said they could not confirm the reports . \nWhat are U.S. options for Libya ? \nClinton said imposition of a no-fly zone is under consideration , but Mullen said doing so would be `` an extraordinarily complex operation . '' \nA top U.S. general said Tuesday that any effort to establish a no-fly zone over the country would include eliminating Libya 's air defenses . \nIt would be `` challenging , '' U.S. Central Command leader Gen. James Mattis told the Senate Armed Services committee . \nIn western Libya , Ban said , there were reports of ongoing clashes between government forces and armed opponents . \nHe noted `` allegations of extrajudicial killings , arbitrary arrests , detentions and torture . '' \nThough more members of the military have reportedly sided with the opposition , Gadhafi 's supporters `` appear to be holding a tight grip on western parts of the country , chiefly Tripoli , '' he said . \nHe warned of `` serious indications '' that the numbers of refugees and displaced persons were reaching crisis proportions and worried that the violence could disrupt distribution networks and lead to food shortages . \nThe U.N. refugee agency reported that nearly 150,000 people had crossed Libya 's borders into Egypt and Tunisia and thousands more were arriving hourly at the borders . \nBan called for immediate action by the international community . \n`` Time is of the essence , '' he said . \n`` Thousands of lives are at stake . '' \nIndeed , at the border with Tunisia , many recent arrivals said they had been robbed or forced to pay bribes en route . \nSome said they had been threatened with death . \nOne man said Libyan soldiers used electric cables to beat him as he waited at the airport and demanded $ 500 from him . \nWhen he told them he did n't have it , they said , `` Die then '' and threw him into the street . \nTunisian authorities appeared to be struggling to cope with the arriving wave of refugees . \nVolunteers hurled fresh bread and water into the crowds . \n`` There is nothing for them on that side , '' a policeman turned volunteer said from the Tunisian side of the border . \nHe was one of many Tunisians donating their time to take food , water and supplies to the border . \nMany said they were livid that international organizations were slow in arriving . \nMeanwhile , more parts of the regime have broken off , joining calls for Gadhafi to halt the violence . \nIn London , the Libyan Embassy said it was siding with the opposition , condemning what it called `` all acts of murder and terror '' taking place in Libya . \nThe military situation on the ground was complex : Forces loyal to Gadhafi tried to retake a town near the capital that is under opposition control but were repelled , an opposition leader in the town told CNN Tuesday . \nThe source said pro-Gadhafi troops with tanks and anti-aircraft guns attacked Zawiya from east and west at nightfall Monday , but did not capture the town . \nA senior official in Gadhafi 's regime denied that government forces attacked rebels in Zawiya . \nSenior members of the government told CNN that Zawiya and Misrata are key to their effort to regain control of the country . \nThe officials insisted they want a peaceful resolution , but witnesses have described repeated violent efforts by the regime to regain control of areas Gadhafi has lost . \nZawiya was calm Tuesday , but Gadhafi 's troops remained nearby , the opposition leader and another source in the town said . \nCNN is not naming them to protect their safety . \nMisrata was protected by its residents and military defectors and the situation there on Tuesday was stable , said Abd al Baset Imzeereq , who identified himself as the spokesman for the newly formed city council . \nPro-Gadhafi forces are stationed in the Navy college about 15 kilometers -LRB- nine miles -RRB- outside the city and have not attempted to move into the city center since its fall , he said . \nThe forces appear to be stationed there not to try to retake the city , but to protect the ammunition depot in the college and `` to terrorize the people '' by opening fire on them . \nAt least two farmers were killed Monday when these forces shot at their vehicle , Imzeereq said . \nStill , some semblance of normalcy was visible Tuesday , when some banks had reopened in Misrata and people were able to withdraw money or get loans , he said . \nFood supplies were ample , he said , but medical goods were scarce . \nImzeereq said at least 33 have been killed and another 487 wounded in Misrata since the unrest began . \nThe capital city of Tripoli was quiet Tuesday as more people here also tried to resume normal life . \nPrices of basic goods have increased ; a Tripoli resident said she could not get paid due to unspecified problems in her bank . \nSome residents told CNN they want to protest but fear being killed . \nSaif al-Islam Gadhafi , the leader 's 38-year-old son who has spoken on behalf of the regime during the protests , told CNN his talks with the opposition are in `` chaos '' because the opposition is divided , with no clear leaders . \nMany Libyans have rejected the younger Gadhafi 's remarks during the uprising . \nBut U.S. officials made similar comments about the rebel forces . \nA U.S. official who wished to remain nameless because the official was not authorized to speak on the record said it 's `` unclear who the leaders in the opposition are and that makes it difficult '' for the U.S. to provide assistance . \n`` The intelligence community is aggressively pursing information on the ground , '' said the official , who added that the CIA has had a presence in the country for some time . \n`` I think it remains to be seen how effectively military leaders who have defected from Gadhafi 's forces can organize the opposition in the country , '' said Gates . \n`` We are watching that unfold . '' \nOver the past two weeks , government forces have repeatedly clashed with demonstrators and rebel forces , fired on crowds and at times shot indiscriminately at people in the streets , numerous witnesses have told CNN . \nThe elder Gadhafi made no public appearances Tuesday , but he appeared out of touch on Monday , denying having used force against his people and even denying the existence of the protests . \n`` No demonstration at all in the streets , '' the 68-year-old ruler told ABC and the BBC in a joint interview in Tripoli . \n`` They love me , all my people with me , they love me all . \nThey will die to protect me , my people , '' said Gadhafi , who has controlled Libya for nearly 42 years . \nBut Libya 's Deputy U.N. Ambassador Ibrahim Dabbashi disagreed . \n`` I do n't believe that even his family loves him at this moment , '' said Dabbashi , who has joined the rebel movement in calling for Gadhafi to step down . \n`` I think no one loves him at all . \nI think the whole Libyan people hate him now . \nWith all the bloodshed , all the killing ... he 's certainly out of his mind .

'' \nMost nations have banned their use through the Convention on Cluster Munitions , which became international law in August . \nNATO : Give Gadhafi 's assets to rebels `` Libya needs to halt the use of these weapons immediately , and take all steps to ensure that civilians are protected from the deadly remnants they have left behind , '' Goose said . \nHuman Rights Watch said cluster munitions were used about a kilometer from the battle line between rebel and government forces and appear to have landed about 300 meters from Misrata Hospital . \nBut the organization , citing security concerns , said it could not inspect the impact sites and had not determined whether any civilians were hurt . \nA spokesman for the Libyan government said the charge was not true . \n`` We would never use such weapons against Libyan people , '' Musa Ibrahim said . \n`` Also , the world is watching , so we just could not do it . '' \nThe charge came as Western leaders described a `` medieval siege '' Friday on Misrata , which has been pounded for days by Gadhafi 's mortar and artillery rounds . \nSome 1,200 of the more than 8,000 migrants stranded in the besieged city were rescued Friday by the International Organization for Migration -LRB- IOM -RRB- . \nThe group chartered a boat to pluck them from the war-torn port city and deliver them to the Libyan rebel stronghold of Benghazi in the eastern part of the country . \nThe aid group said the migrants were from various nations and included women and children . \nAll were weak and dehydrated . \nMedical agencies set up a small hospital on deck . \nThe IOM identified 8,300 migrants living in the open around the Misrata port without adequate food or medical care as the city came under regular fire . \nThe group hopes to send back the chartered boat to evacuate a second round of people if it receives enough donations . \n`` This is a terrible situation , '' said Pasquale Lupoli , the group 's Middle East representative . \n`` They are the forgotten victims of the crisis and should n't be . '' \nIn Benghazi , about 2,000 anti-Gadhafi demonstrators held up signs and shouted slogans that made it clear they are still fighting for Gadhafi 's removal . \n`` Gadhafi Go to Hell , '' read one . \n`` Thanks for USA and NATO and France and UK , '' read another . \nBut several participants voiced concern that the NATO efforts were not enough , telling CNN that without more support , they may fail . \n`` They did n't do anything , the NATO , '' one man said . \n`` We want more support from the United States of America , more power , more support for our people , '' said another . \nThe military deadlock in Libya between Gadhafi 's forces and rebels shows little sign of resolution . \nWestern powers have said repeatedly that airstrikes were intended to fulfill a United Nations mandate to protect civilians . \nHowever , in a joint opinion piece that appeared Friday in three European newspapers , U.S. President Barack Obama , French President Nicolas Sarkozy and British Prime Minister David Cameron wrote about better times once there is a regime change . \n`` Our duty and our mandate under U.N. Security Council Resolution 1973 is to protect civilians , and we are doing that , '' they wrote . \n`` It is not to remove -LRB- Gadhafi -RRB- by force . \nBut it is impossible to imagine a future for Libya with -LRB- Gadhafi -RRB- in power . '' \n`` The International Criminal Court is rightly investigating the crimes committed against civilians and the grievous violations of international law , '' they wrote . \n`` It is unthinkable that someone who has tried to massacre his own people can play a part in their future government . '' \nThe leaders likened the fighting in Misrata to a medieval siege and called on Libyan troops to return to their barracks . \n`` We are convinced that better times lie ahead for the people of Libya , '' they wrote . \nOpposition forces kept up the fight Friday , saying they had pushed west from Ajdabiya to the town of al-Brega , which has changed hands several times and appears to remain under the control of Gadhafi loyalists . \nWarplanes were heard Friday over Ajdabiya , but CNN could not independently verify the rebel advance . \nThe debate over NATO 's strategy in Libya buzzed at high-level meetings this week in Europe as well as in Qatar , host of the first gathering of the international Libya Contact Group , charged with mapping out peace for Libya . \nWith the conflict at a deadly impasse , Britain and France have been pressuring NATO to step up airstrikes . \nAt a NATO summit in Berlin on Thursday , Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen told reporters that NATO has the necessary assets to continue aerial strikes , but the tactical nature of the fight has changed . \n`` Now they hide their heavy arms in populated areas , where before many targets were easier to get to , '' Rasmussen said . \n`` To avoid civilian casualties , we need very sophisticated equipment . \nSo , we need a few more precision fighter ground-attack aircraft for air-to-ground missions .

{"id": "198", "time": "2011-08-11", "text": "The United States and its NATO allies have been pushing for the ouster of Moammar Gadhafi for more than six months now . \nThe Libyan strongman continues to hold on , but it may just be a matter of time before he is forced from power . \nWe asked him to summarize the challenges the United States will likely face and what it should be prepared to do . \nHere is what he had to say : The first challenge will be security . \nFailure to maintain public order is what got us into big trouble in Iraq , where Saddam Hussein s stay behind operation stirred civic unrest and destroyed government buildings . \nThe murder in Libya last month of the overall rebel commander is a reminder that internecine warfare among the more than forty-five rebel militias is a real possibility . \nPeople who lost family and tribal members to the Gadhafi regime may seek to settle scores . \nFormer regime elements may seek to defend themselves and to privatize state assets . \nCriminals will see opportunities to traffic in arms , drugs and even people . \nThe humanitarian challenges will be no less daunting . \nFighting has displaced at least half a million Libyans from their homes . \nPerhaps half of those are still in Libya , and many who are not will seek to return quickly once Gadhafi falls . \nFood , water , shelter and health services need to be secured for the most vulnerable . \nIn addition , keeping water and electricity flowing to the residents of Tripoli and other major urban centers will be vital to maintaining public order , especially if Qaddafi falls this summer . \nU.S. interests in Libya are limited , but a relatively successful transition from the Gadhafi regime to a united , stable , more open and democratic Libya would be seen in the region and more widely as a credit to the NATO-led intervention . \nIt would also enable Libya to resume oil and gas exports , demonstrate the international community s capacity to manage such transitions and encourage positive outcomes to other Arab Spring protests , including those in Yemen and Syria . \nFailure to stabilize Libya could lead to chaos , breakup of the Libyan state that sets an unwelcome precedent elsewhere , or restoration of dictatorship . \nThese outcomes would all damage American and allied credibility and likely also cause major problems for our European allies , including shortfalls in energy supplies , loss of major investments and a continuing refugee flow . \nRefugees could also cause problems in Tunisia , Egypt , and the rest of the Mediterranean . \nIt is therefore the Europeans , along with the Arab League , who should take the lead in post-Gadhafi stabilization of Libya , under a clear United Nations Security Council mandate that recognizes a legitimate post-Gadhafi Libyan authority and sets out strategic goals for the transition . \nThe goals should include a united and sovereign Libya within its well-established borders that can sustain , govern , and defend itself through inclusive democratic institutions , using Libya s resources transparently and accountably for the benefit of all its people . \nQuick deployment of a peacekeeping force of several thousand paramilitary police , mainly to keep order in Tripoli and other population centers , would help ensure these goals are met . \nThe European Union and its member states can deploy several hundred paramilitaries . \nTurkey and Arab countries might supply the remainder . \nAn international peacekeeping operation would not administer Libya but would support an inclusive interim authority in maintaining stability , providing humanitarian assistance , and beginning the reconstruction process . \nWhat if this does not work ? \nNATO will need to be prepared to step in . \nOnly as a last resort to deal with widespread disorder , a threatened breakup of the Libyan state , or a humanitarian catastrophe should the international community consider armed intervention without the invitation of a legitimate Libyan authority . \nThis could mean U.S. boots on the ground , but only briefly as part of a broader multilateral effort . \nLeadership in post-Gadhafi Libya should be passed as quickly as possible to the Libyans , who have already set up local councils and a Transitional National Council , which help to organize and provide services in the liberated portions of the country . \nThese indigenous institutions merit nurturing and support , including unfreezing of Gadhafi-era assets so that the councils in liberated areas can begin to meet the needs of their populations . \nThe post-Gadhafi era has already begun there . \nLibya is a resource-rich country with a relatively well-educated citizenry that has demonstrated courage under fire . \nThe country lacks institutions and political experience , but not talent and commitment . \nThe international community should prepare to support Libyan efforts to take charge of the country s destiny once Gadhafi leaves the scene . \nThis whole war is propaganda right from the start when they declared that armed civilians are being killed in the oppen desert ... strange because in the UK unarmed gangs are criminal what if the youngsters in the UK carried AK74 's RPG 's drove tanks from day 1 -LRB- fact -RRB- and had a UK general defect to his hometown and tribe with 8000 troops including special forces and 100 + tanks jets and fighter helicopters and they all call in dozen powerful armies like some kind of Trojan horse ... this would boil the blood of many civilians that had no say in this war and the government forced to fight this senseless bloodshed full of slander and media spin . \nAugust 11 , 2011 at 4:16 pm | Reply August 13 , 2011 at 3:55 am | Reply The article states that `` the post-Gadaffi era has already begun .

'' \nBut , on Tuesday , officials from the government in Tripoli escorted international journalists to a mass funeral in Majer , and to the site where the government and residents said the NATO airstrike killed civilians . \nJournalists saw the bodies of children and women among the dead and wounded at the site of the attack . \nIt was impossible for CNN to confirm the extent of the casualties . \nA spokesman for the Tripoli government , Musa Ibrahim , called it `` a crime beyond imagination . '' \nFor weeks , NATO warplanes have been bombing Zlitan on a daily basis . \nMeanwhile , rebels have been pressing toward Zlitan 's eastern gates from the nearby opposition-held port of Misrata . \nSpeaking to journalists in Majer on Tuesday , Ibrahim accused NATO of bombing Majer to clear the way for rebels to advance on the Gadhafi-controlled city of Zlitan , a few kilometers north . \nMaj. Gen. Nick Pope , spokesman for the British Ministry of Defense , said Thursday that British aircraft have been in action in recent days `` as part of NATO 's mission to protect civilians at risk of attack from Col. Gadhafi 's former regime . '' \nThe latest operations included British aircraft carrying out precision airstrikes on several sites in and around Zlitan , Pope said in a statement . \nThe report of civilian deaths stirred anger in Washington . \n`` If such reports are true , it further highlights the increased risks to civilians that has occurred as a result of military intervention in Libya and is further evidence that continued bombing by NATO ... is an inappropriate tool to protect civilians or force Moammar Gadhafi from power , '' wrote Rep. Dennis Kucinich in a letter to Ban . \n`` How can they continue to cause the deaths of innocent civilians under the color of international law and not be held accountable ? '' \nthe Ohio Democrat continued . \nThe changing nature of who controls what in Libya was underscored Thursday by events in Washington , where the Libyan Embassy officially reopened under the control of the Transitional National Council . \n`` This is a message that Gadhafi can no more rule Libya , '' said Ali Aujali , who was accredited Thursday as head of the Libyan mission . \nAujuli said he talked Thursday with State Department officials about the Obama administration 's efforts to help the TNC gain access to some $ 30 billion in frozen Libyan assets . \nThe State Department had ordered the embassy closed in March and expelled diplomats loyal to Gadhafi . \nAujali had resigned his post as the Gadhafi regime 's ambassador to the United States in February and has since represented the opposition in Washington . \nThe United States on July 15 recognized the rebel movement based in Benghazi as Libya 's rightful government . \nCNN 's Jomana Karadsheh , Elise Labott , Joe Vaccarello , Yasmin Amer and Kareem Khadder contributed to this report . \n"}

'' \nIbrahim added , `` Truthfully , he has fallen under a lot of social and emotional pressure as we 've noticed . \nHe could n't handle it and preferred that he left . \nThat 's a personal decision . '' \nAbdallah 's departure comes as rebels have been reporting major advances toward their goal of cutting off Libya 's coastal road , the Tripoli regime 's lifeline , and reaching the capital . \nIn the coastal city of al-Zawiya , clashes were ongoing . \n`` At the moment , it 's quite hard to say who is in complete control of the city , '' said Deborah Haynes , a reporter for the Times of London who left the city Monday . \n`` The rebels say they have 80 % of it under their control , but it is a very fluid situation . '' \nPro-Gadhafi snipers were holed up in buildings in the main square , where rebels were firing at them with rocket-propelled grenades , she said . \nRebel fighters controlled all but the eastern part of the city , said Hassan Jwaili , who is a rebel fighter and a source who has proven reliable in the past . \nGadhafi forces shelled al-Zawiya with Grad rockets from nearby Janzur , killing two rebels , bringing the number of dead in al-Zawiya to 11 , with dozens more wounded , Jwaili said . \nNATO airstrikes , though , have hit Gadhafi forces in Janzur , aiding the rebels , he said . \nWest of al-Zawiya , rebel forces entered the towns of Surman and Sabrata late Sunday , Jwaili said . \nTwenty-two rebel fighters died and 38 were wounded in the towns , he said . \nWest of Sabrata , rebels surrounded Gadhafi forces inside a military camp , he said . \nClashes were continuing for control of Tiji , on the plains of the western mountains , Jwaili said . \nAnd in Assaba , east of Qawalish , also in the western mountains , rebel fighters had surrounded the city and negotiations were under way for Gadhafi forces to turn themselves in , Jwaili said . \nBut a Tripoli government spokesman denied the assertions that rebels were advancing . \nGadhafi himself , in an address broadcast Monday on Libyan state television , urged Libyans to fight opposition forces and `` cleanse this sweet and honorable land . '' \nCheers from the crowd accompanied the speech , cries of `` Allah , Libya , Gadhafi and nothing else '' at times drowning out Gadhafi . \n`` We dance and sing despite the strikes ! \nThe strikes will be over and NATO will be defeated , '' Gadhafi said . \n`` Move always forward to the challenge ; pick up your weapons ; go to the fight in order to liberate Libya inch by inch from the traitors and from NATO . \nBe prepared to fight if they hit the ground . '' \nClaims of control over the city of al-Zawiya -- if true -- would be a strategic blow against government forces , since the road through the city serves as a critical supply line to Tripoli from the west and has an oil terminal . \nIn his news conference Monday evening , Ibrahim denied the assertions and said Gadhafi forces were in `` complete control '' of al-Zawiya after having halted rebel attacks there . \n`` There are a few armed gangs inside the city who took advantage of the opportunity to enter but they are limited , '' he said . \n`` All of south Zawiya is protected . \nThe armed gangs tried to attack people in their homes , occupy a school and raid shops . \nThe government closed off a main road for the protection of the people . '' \nThe rebels say that they were the ones who closed the coastal road . \nIbrahim said heavy NATO airstrikes were continuing to strike some coastal cities , including al-Zawiya , with the eastern city of al-Brega bearing the brunt of the attacks . \n`` To be honest , they 're unable to shake our civilians or our youth , '' he said . \nHe said the rebels suffered heavy casualties . \n`` Hundreds of them injured and tens killed . \nBecause of this , now people in the eastern regions and even the armed gangs refer to al-Brega as a cemetery . \nAl-Brega is synonymous with death . '' \nIn Tiji , 40 rebels were killed by pro-Gadhafi forces , who took three tanks and a number of weapons from them , he said . \nIbrahim said officials were negotiating with international companies that have expressed interest in returning to Libya , he said . \nThe goal is for them to resume operations `` very soon . '' \nIbrahim added that the Tripoli government forces were planning to `` free '' the key port city of Misrata from rebel forces . \n`` We ca n't tell everything but we 're in a position to free Misrata , '' he said . \n`` It 's not an easy feat . '' \nRebel commander al-Zintani rejected Ibrahim 's assertions that Gadhafi 's forces controlled al-Zawiya and Surman , which is also along the western supply road , as well as the government 's claims to Garyan , another city on a key supply route leading to Tripoli from the south . \n`` The next few days will prove him wrong , '' the rebel field commander predicted . \nNATO said Sunday it had struck a Gadhafi military facility in Garyan . \nRebel spokesman Jumma Ibrahim has said that rebels control the coastal road connecting al-Zawiya with a post on the Tunisia border , but that Gadhafi forces still controlled the post . \nReports from Tunisia 's state-owned Tataouine radio corroborated the account . \nCNN has not been able to independently confirm battle claims , including who controls al-Zawiya . \nDaily claims of rebel successes indicate rapid progress when compared with positions rebels claimed on previous days . \nThe government in Tripoli has consistently downplayed claims of rebel victories and played up the strength of Gadhafi 's forces . \n`` You have to remember we are very powerful , '' Musa Ibrahim said Saturday . \n`` The tens of thousands and tens of thousands of volunteers are armed right now . \nIt does n't matter whether NATO advances or not , whether rebels advance or not , because we will always be able to fight , in a year 's time , in two years , in three years . '' \nFive months into the Libyan war , the rebels have won international support in their effort to oust Gadhafi . \nThey have been aided by NATO airstrikes that began in March after the U.N. Security Council approved a resolution that ordered civilians be protected . \nCNN 's Matthew Chance , Kareem Khadder , Amir Ahmed , Salma Abdelaziz , Kamal Ghattas , Yasmin Amer , Mohamed Fadel Fahmy and Barbara Starr contributed to this report . \n"}
{"id": "368", "time": "2011-08-16", "text": "Residents often said everything was great : `` mia mia '' Was it a coping method or a survival tactic under Gadhafi ? \nWatson says he watched slow destruction of a country Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- `` Mia mia . '' \nIt is an extremely popular phrase , widely used in Libya , that translates roughly to `` 100 percent . '' \nNine times out of 10 , that is what Libyans said when I asked how they were coping with nightly bombardments by NATO warplanes , electricity blackouts that lasted days and rebel forces who were pressing forward on three fronts . \n`` Mia mia , '' they said with a smile . \nIn other words , everything 's great ! \nWas this the cheerful coping method of a society living amid olive groves and palm trees next to the Mediterranean Sea ? \nOr was `` mia mia '' a survival tactic for people who had grown up within the authoritarian system of Moammar Gadhafi 's perpetual revolution ? \nThe whispers of dissent my colleagues and I often heard in Tripoli suggested the latter . \nOne night , after we had filmed the largest poster ever of a head of state in Tripoli 's Green Square , a middle-aged man rode past on a bicycle , yelling , `` Do n't believe what you see ! \nIt 's all lies ! '' \nThen he disappeared into traffic , swallowed up amid posters of Gadhafi and regime loyalists , who shrouded themselves in the green of the Libyan flag . \nHis weapon of choice ? \nHis brush Even in peacetime , Gadhafi 's Libya had the Orwellian trappings of a police state governed by a culture of fear . \nI first traveled to Tripoli in 2007 , when I was greeted at passport control by a portrait of Gadhafi in sunglasses and the revolutionary slogan `` Partners not Wage-Slaves . '' \nAt the time , Libya was coming in from the cold after years of international isolation . \nU.S. diplomats opening a new American Embassy were temporarily housed in a sky-high suite of the pricey Corinthia Hotel . \nMeanwhile , European businessmen were downstairs in the hotel lobby , plotting ways to profit off bountiful Libyan petro-dollars . \nThe foreigners were free to make deals with the government . \nBut Libyans were still clearly afraid to say much beyond the mantra of `` mia mia . '' \nGadhafi 's cult of personality reigned supreme . \nDuring that visit , I watched a highly placed engineer and an academic at a government `` think tank '' separately feign illness rather than speak on the record about their country . \nEven though I had jumped through bureaucratic hoops , acquiring all the necessary permits from the Foreign Press Department to conduct interviews , these adult , educated men were terrified about sticking their necks out and perhaps saying something that might accidentally challenge Gadhafi 's utopian vision of Libya . \nAfter all , in the 1980s , Gadhafi banned restaurants , lawyers and the entire retail sector . \nNow he had performed an ideological U-turn and was apparently embracing capitalism . \nIn 2007 , I had to travel everywhere with a government minder . \nI was permitted to spend only a single night reporting in the eastern city of Benghazi before being hustled back to Tripoli . \nThe regime 's discomfort was prescient . \nFour years later , the barely contained political tensions in Benghazi exploded , and Libya 's second city became the capital for anti-Gadhafi rebels . \nSome Libyans clearly had had enough of `` mia mia . '' \nIt was surprising , then , to see the Gadhafi regime still hosting journalists from the U.S. , France and England five months into an aerial bombing campaign that had been led by these three governments . \nThe government was trying to shape international opinion . \nBut it was doing so with the clumsiness one would expect from a regime that enjoyed absolute control over its own media for more than 40 years . \nThroughout the conflict , almost all foreign journalists have been housed in the luxury Rixos Hotel , which lost its Turkish management after Ankara turned its back on Gadhafi several months into the war . \nThe only time we were allowed to film outside of the hotel was on government bus tours , surrounded by government escorts . \nOftentimes , we would n't learn about the destination until the last minute . \nIt was like trying to see Libya through a keyhole . \nWhen the regime did n't like our subsequent reporting , it did not hesitate to insult and intimidate . \n`` I think you are an agent of NATO . \nYou work for Hillary Clinton , '' the head of the foreign media department told me when he summoned me to his office for one of several hourlong lectures . \n`` You are a criminal ! '' \nyelled his young assistant Issa . \nThey were furious at my reported estimate that `` more than 10,000 '' regime supporters attended a recent pro-Gadhafi rally . \nThey would have preferred the headline printed in the regime 's English-language Al-Jamahiriya News : `` More than Five Million Libyans organized in the Marches . '' \nConsidering Libya 's entire population is estimated at just over 6 million , Al-Jamahiriya 's alleged rally would have been a remarkable event to witness , especially when broad swaths of the country were still under the control of the rebels . \nSometimes , the bus tours backfired . \nOn a visit to the front-line city of Zlitan , government officials brought us to a law school that had clearly been bombed by NATO warplanes . \nIt was , they said , yet another example of the Western military alliance bombing a civilian target . \nBut the campus of the bombed-out school was littered with military uniforms and empty wooden ammunition boxes . \n`` Those belonged to the school 's security guards , '' said a minder . \nWe asked outside military experts to examine the serial numbers on the ammo boxes . \nThey all agreed that Cyrillic letters clearly showed that one box had contained Russian-made 14.5 millimeter armor-piercing incendiary B-32 rounds . \nThese are high-caliber munitions for the kind of machine gun that is typically mounted on armored personnel carriers and anti-aircraft guns . \n`` The guard would need to be about 3 meters tall to carry the gun for those , '' security analyst Zoran Kusovac wrote in an e-mail to CNN . \n`` But if Hulk Hogan was the guard ... '' The trouble is , the regime 's habit of exaggeration and outright lies was often matched by the outrageous claims of the rebels . \nThe opposition fighters often claimed to control cities that later proved to be in loyalist hands . \nAfter last month 's killing of rebel military commander Abdul Fattah Younis , the Benghazi-based Transitional National Council issued wildly contradictory statements . \nEventually , it emerged that a rival rebel faction killed Younis and set his corpse on fire before dumping it in a valley . \nNATO did n't help matters in the truth department . \nThroughout the conflict , Western governments stuck to their argument that NATO 's mission was to `` save civilian lives . '' \nBut the aerial bombardment of loyalist positions just before rebels launched offensives against Gadhafi-held towns hardly resembled life-saving operations . \nAdd that to the crippling economic blockade of Tripoli , and suddenly NATO 's mission appeared to be focused more on regime change than on protecting innocent civilians . \nThe Libyan government could make a strong case that NATO had exceeded the mandate provided by a United Nations Security Council Resolution . \nBut the Gadhafi regime was so obsessed with not appearing weak that it refused to let journalists see the hardships endured by Libyan citizens . \nI saw the extent of the crippling power shortages only when I sneaked out of the Rixos one night . \nIn downtown Tripoli , I was stunned to see an entire neighborhood plunged into darkness , with families breaking their Ramadan fast by candlelight . \nResidents told me they had n't had any electricity in days . \nWe also started hearing rumors of protests due to the lack of power . \nI asked Libya 's prime minister about these reports at a news conference the next day . \n`` The only rallies that came out on the streets in the last few days were those supporting the leadership of the country , '' Baghdadi Al-Mahmoudi said . \n`` Libyans are able to hold firm against these sanctions and this aggression . '' \nAnother `` mia mia '' moment from one of the highest-ranked officials in the land . \nAnd who could challenge him ? \nAs early as March , the regime shut down Internet access and cell phone text messaging throughout the entire country . \nOne of the only exceptions was the Rixos Hotel , where government minders came to check their e-mail -LRB- and charge their cell phones , as the power shortages got worse -RRB- . \nThe Rixos was where Libyan state TV talk show host Yousef Shakeer lived with his family . \nHe broadcast from a studio in the basement , serving up nightly denunciations of NATO , the rebels and the foreign journalists in the hotel ... while predicting Gadhafi 's imminent victory over his enemies . \nEvery night , gunfire rang out around the Rixos . \nAsked what it was , government officials always said , `` They are supporters of Gadhafi celebrating victory . '' \nCelebrating five months of near-constant victory must have been exhausting . \nWhen NATO 's nightly bombing runs struck closer to the Rixos , the strange collection of regime supporters who somehow could afford $ 400-a-night hotel rooms sometimes lashed out at foreign reporters . \n`` F -- off ! '' \na Libyan man screamed at CNN producer Jomana Karadsheh , as she ran to film 2 a.m. explosions from the roof . \nLater , he apologized when he learned that Jomana was Jordanian . \nSeen through this bizarre lens and surrounded by antagonistic ideologues , reporters ended up questioning themselves on everything they saw . \nWas that person I interviewed actually a government agent ? \nWere the dead people in those coffins really civilians killed by last night 's airstrikes ? \nHow many people really supported Gadhafi ? \nImagine my surprise when on one of my last days in Libya , I sneaked away from government minders in the neighborhood of Souk al Jumma , which has been the scene of anti-Gadhafi street protests . \nThere , I met a man named Tahir who told me he was being patient , waiting for the rebels to come from the Nafusa Mountains and Misrata to liberate Tripoli . \n`` Lies , all lies , '' he said when I asked him about the wild crowds of Gadhafi supporters broadcast nightly on Libyan state TV . \n`` Thank you , Britain ; thank you , America , '' a group of teenagers playing foosball yelled to Jomana and cameraman Joe Duran in another part of Souk al Juma . \nThe best argument I ever heard for defending the dictator came from an interpreter named Mohamed . \nHe was worried about his family 's safety , having heard rumors of rebels attacking dark-skinned Libyans . \nNever having worked with the rebels , I could not confirm or deny Mohamed 's claim . \nBut it raised the specter of racial and tribal conflict in the event of Gadhafi 's overthrow . \n`` Report the truth , please , '' a Libyan man standing in line told me as a Tunisian customs officer processed my passport last week . \nI was about to leave Libya and at the end of my rope after a month of virtual house arrest . \n`` What is the truth ? '' \n`` Mia mia ?! '' No , the man said . \nHe was fleeing to Tunisia with his family because there was no electricity in Tripoli and because Gadhafi 's forces had opened fire with machine guns on a recent street protest against the power outages . \nAnother claim I could not independently confirm . \nFor now , only one thing is certain . \nDuring my month in Libya , I watched a country slowly being destroyed , city by city , town by town . \nIt does n't matter whether the damage is being caused by warplanes , rebel machine guns , loyalist rockets or the sudden departure of the foreign guest workers and educated Libyans who kept the economy working . \nThe fact is , Libya is starting to look and feel more and more like another Arab country whose long-ruling dictator was overthrown with the help of foreign armies . \n"}

Roland Lavoie , who described the advances as `` the most significant anti-Gadhafi territorial gain we have seen in months .

'' \n`` Impossible to say when he 'll go , but it 's clear that he will go , '' Toner told CNN 's Brooke Baldwin . \nMeanwhile Friday , opposition forces said a former Libyan prime minister has left Tripoli and joined with rebels in the country 's western mountains . \nAbdel Salam Jalloud `` is in Zintan and he is a free man among the rebels , '' said Jumma Ibrahim , a spokesman for the Military Council of the Western Mountain Region , a rebel group . \nKaim declined to confirm or deny the report . \nJalloud was among members of Gadhafi 's inner-circle responsible for the 1969 coup that put Gadhafi into power . \nJalloud fell out of favor with the regime in the mid-1990s . \nThe speculation over a Gadhafi `` last stand '' comes as his troops are battling rebel forces on a number of fronts , including in the west , where fighting has raged for days over the strategic city of Zawiya , about 30 miles west of Tripoli and a major supply route to the capital . \nFierce artillery fire could be heard around Zawiya on Friday . \nRebels took a major oil refinery there , said Hobab Jomaa , a rebel fighter . \nThey were in control of the western part of the city , but battles continued in the eastern part , he said . \nWhen asked when rebels might begin their move toward Tripoli , one fighter in Zawiya told CNN 's Sara Sidner , `` Two days , maybe by the end of the week . '' \n`` They are becoming more emboldened , '' Sidner said of the rebels . \n`` They feel like they can really have a chance at Tripoli .

Radwan Fheid said . \n`` The snipers are near Zawiya hospital . \nThey ca n't stay because of the shelling . \nThese are the last days , God willing . '' \nRebels are setting up checkpoints and field hospitals to treat the wounded , many of whom have been shot or struck by shrapnel . \nAt a hospital in nearby Yefren , doctors said they had treated more than 200 patients over the past four days -- some of them rebel soldiers from any of several front lines , some of them civilians . \nAmong the latter was a 9-year-old girl who was in her house when it was hit by a missile , sending shrapnel into her , a doctor said . \n`` Unfortunately , there is more than 90 % chance that she may lose her right arm here , '' he said . \nMedical staff said they were donating their own blood to keep their patients alive . \nOne man , both legs wrapped in bandages , cried out in pain . \nDoctors said there were not enough staff members to properly take care of the patient load . \nZawiya is west of Tripoli on a strategic supply route . \nRebel control of Zawiya would represent a major advance toward putting a stranglehold on the Gadhafi-controlled seat of power . \nCol.

'' \nThe mission now represents the Transitional National Council -LRB- TNC -RRB- , the rebel movement based in Benghazi , that the United States recognized as the rightful government of Libya on July 15 . \nThe embassy was closed in March after the State Department expelled all diplomats loyal to Gadhafi . \nAujali , who previously represented the Gadhafi regime in Washington , resigned his post in February , and has since represented the TNC in Washington . \nHe was formally accredited as head of the Libyan mission last week . \nOn Tuesday , Col. Roland Lavoie , a spokesman for NATO 's military operation , said that `` anti-Gadhafi forces are now assuming control of the key approaches to Tripoli . '' \nHe described the advances as `` the most significant anti-Gadhafi territorial gain we have seen in months . '' \nSince the end of July , as the threat from pro-Gadhafi forces has diminished , thousands of people have returned to their homes in the western Nafusa mountains , he said . \nSince Friday , the northwest coastal city of Misrata has been free of pro-Gadhafi forces , he said . \nAnd the threat from nearby Zlitan has diminished as pro-Gadhafi forces are being pushed farther west , he added . \nLavoie said rebels had occupied Surman and Sabratha west of Tripoli but added that the regions were `` still contested . '' \nHowever , Libyan state television reported that pro-Gadhafi forces and tribal fighters were `` cleansing the city of Sabratha from the gangs of traitors '' and had secured the coastal road , a key supply pipeline into Tripoli . \nThough the center of Zawiya was under rebel control , `` there 's still reports of fighting also in the suburbs , '' Lavoie said . \nA spokesman for the Gadhafi government offered a different view on Tuesday . \n`` We are doing very well , '' Ibrahim Musa said . \n`` It 's true that it 's a bit slow ; people are still saying that we 're not acting immediately and that we 're having problems in Surman and Sabratha and whatnot because of armed gangs . \nThat 's true , but , God willing , we are able to lead this battle successfully . \nWe will achieve peace and victory .

{"id": "57", "time": "2011-08-18", "text": "Fighting in Libya started with anti-government demonstrations in February and escalated into a nationwide civil war . \nFor months , rebel fighters -- who have controlled the eastern city of Benghazi and other areas -- have been trying to move closer toward Tripoli , in the west . \nThey are seeking the ouster of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi , who has ruled Libya for 42 years . \nInternational leaders have accused Gadhafi 's regime of committing human rights violations and killing civilians . \nLibyan officials have repeatedly accused NATO of killing civilians in airstrikes . \nHere are some key points CNN has reported in the conflict . \nThree days after the fall of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak , calls go out on Facebook for peaceful demonstrations in Libya against leader Moammar Gadhafi . \nThe Libyan leader , who has ruled over the country for more than four decades , voiced support for Mubarak during the Egyptian crisis . \nAbout 200 demonstrators protesting the arrest of a human activist take to the streets in the coastal city of Benghazi , witnesses say . \nSeveral of them are arrested amid confrontations with police . \nA highly placed source close to the Libyan government tells CNN , `` There is nothing serious here . \nThese are just young people fighting each other .

{"id": "299", "time": "2011-08-18", "text": "In mid-July , when I visited Benghazi , the stronghold of the Libyan rebels who are fighting to unseat Moammar Gadhafi , the brigade headquarters from where Gadhafi 's forces once ruled the eastern part of the country had been reduced to a graffiti-encrusted , burned-out wreck . \nIt was a sight I could never have imagined in the 25 years I have studied Libya . \nBut despite the recent rebel advances at Zawiyah , any expectation that the collapse of the Gadhafi regime is imminent - a statement made regularly by all of the NATO militaries now contributing resources to the anti-Gadhafi campaign - remains wishful thinking at this time . \nThe Libyan uprising against the Gadhafi regime is now six months old , and there is no immediate end in sight . \nLong gone is U.S. President Barack Obama 's insistence that multilateral military action against Libya would be a matter `` of days , not weeks . '' \nFor now , the scenarios most likely to bring the conflict to an end revolve around what many close observers refer to as `` catastrophic success '' - the sudden removal of Gadhafi by internal revolt or other means , which would leave a profound political and security vacuum - or extended negotiations between Tripoli and Benghazi led by a neutral interlocutor . \nThe first seems unlikely for now , given the security measures that surround Gadhafi and the fierce loyalty of his immediate supporters . \nAs for the second , although many sides have proposed road maps for talks between the rebels and the Gadhafi government , the prospect of direct negotiations remains distant . \nAfter all , road maps are of little value where roads are nonexistent . \nThe two sides in Libya have put forward baseline demands that make a diplomatic solution unlikely : The rebels refuse to consider any negotiation that involves Gadhafi or anyone representing him , while Tripoli rejects any talks that would question Gadhafi 's legitimacy . \nThus , it seems likely that conditions will have to get much worse before either side will blink . \nThis leaves open the possibility that Libya 's civil war will be decided by a grinding , prolonged military conflict in which Gadhafi 's regime is gradually exhausted by NATO-supported rebel attacks . \nConditions in Tripoli have already become uncomfortable for the Gadhafi government : supplies of food , gasoline , and even ordinary household items are in increasingly short supply . \nThe regime might not have the resources to continue to buy loyalty for much longer . \nAlthough this may suggest that time favors the rebels , the killing of their rebel military commander , Abdul Fattah Younes , last month and the disarray that followed his death have shown that the rebels are plagued by their own internal divisions , which will only get worse as the conflict drags on . \nPut simply , the rebel government is in danger of losing strategic control over its campaign , with the climate of lawlessness and lack of control in eastern Libya threatening to upend whatever gains the rebels may make on the battlefield or in diplomatic circles . \nThe press conference held by Mustapha Abdul-Jalil , the chairman of the National Transitional Council , in the wake of Younes ' death is just one example of the continuing weaknesses of the rebel government . \nAs it fights to reunify the country , the NTC itself remains far from a truly integrated , unified movement . \nAs Jalil spoke at the Tibesti Hotel , angry supporters of Younes emptied their guns into the hotel 's windows . \nFor his part , rather than using the loss of Younes as a rallying call for greater unity , Jalil predictably blamed loyalist forces for the military commander 's death . \nThe NTC was soon forced to recant this statement , however , when it became clear that an out-of-control militia on its own side was likely responsible . \nThe fact that at the conference only members from Younes ' powerful tribe , the Obeidi , were seated around Jalil further belied the illusion that the NTC could function as neutral powerbroker and arbiter , not privileging one group or faction at the expense of others . \nFearing retaliation , no top NTC members were present at the press conference or at Younes ' funeral the next morning . \nAlthough this does not necessarily mean that the rebels ' revolt will inevitably lead to inter-tribal fighting , as articles in The New York Times and elsewhere have suggested , it does illuminate one of the important fault lines : Powerful players in the country , in this case , a tribal group , need to be placated for fear of provoking unrest . \nThe most problematic part of Jalil 's statement was his call to eliminate what he described as `` fifth columns , '' Gadhafi loyalists still active in eastern Libya . \nSuch talk is dangerous and irresponsible in a place as lawless as eastern Libya , where retaliations , violence , and score settling remain common . \nWorst of all , as in all rebellions , trying to identify so-called fifth columns only antagonizes and alienates those people who are content to remain neutral but are forced willy-nilly to align themselves with the NTC and its policies for fear of being identified as traitors . \nJalil 's speech was indicative of the unawareness and inexperience that the NTC continues to exhibit . \nIn the aftermath of the killing , the picture in eastern Libya became both darker and more revealing . \nThe temporary appointment of Suleiman Mahmoud al-Obeidi as the NTC 's new military commander and the dismissal of several individuals from the NTC 's executive committee were widely interpreted as a way to meet charges by the Obeidi tribe that part of the NTC had been complicit in Younes ' killing . \nFor now , the changes have kept the peace , but the larger issue - that NTC structures and policies can be kept hostage to different groups ' interests - has been left unresolved . \nAlthough the focus on tribal rivalries took prominence after Younes ' death , several other fault lines are becoming increasingly visible : between those fighting on the front versus those staying behind in Benghazi , Libyans inside the country who have taken part in the uprising versus those outside the country , and rapidly organizing Islamists versus those with a more secular vision for Libya 's future . \n-LRB- Many rebels are also uneasy over the absence of Mahmoud Jibril , the NTC 's political leader , from the country ; he apparently has his own fears of assassination . -RRB- \nIn all of this turmoil , the essential question for Libya 's future remains whether the NTC will continue to function as a credible , unified political movement , or whether its credibility will further decline as the civil war continues and other incidents inevitably reveal more internal cleavages ? \nIn terms of organization and diplomacy , the NTC has made undeniable progress over the last two months . \nIt has established offices in a number of major cities around the globe , and in July the International Contact Group for Libya -LRB- consisting of all the countries participating in the NATO-led campaign against Gadhafi -RRB- recognized it as the legitimate representative of Libya . \nDespite these successes , there are two almost contradictory sets of feelings palpable in Benghazi today . \nThe first is one of invincibility and unwillingness to compromise , expressed by the soldiers doing the fighting and seen in the intransigence many NTC representatives have toward negotiations . \nThe second is a lingering sense of uncertainty about the future ; no one will acknowledge this fear publicly , however , for fear of being considered disloyal . \nThis uncertainty is caused by the sense that the NTC has so far spent much its time on procedural issues related to a new constitution and to other practical military , security , and social arrangements for a post-Gadhafi Libya . \nBut many people in eastern Libya are afraid that these proto-state institutions will be increasingly undercut by spreading chaos and disagreements before their roots are allowed to take hold . \nOne way the NTC could prevent the growing disarray that further civil war will bring would be to forge a compromise among its supporters for negotiations with Tripoli . \nIn July , I took part in a workshop on negotiations in Benghazi , during which some NTC members , particularly those representing Tripoli , proved immovable . \nBut ultimately they must remember that reconstructing Libya is not simply about creating the institutions of a future state , which , admittedly , the NTC has made good progress on . \nInstead , it is ultimately also about nation-building : instilling in Libyans a sense of unity and consensus , creating a common vision of what Libya should look like in the future , and of providing a sense of leadership to which most citizens can subscribe . \nAnd here the rebel leadership has faltered for a number of reasons : disagreements and suspicions rooted in the country 's history , the everyday constraints of waging a civil war , and the contradictory signals coming from the international community . \nNegotiating a way out of the current impasse before the civil war establishes a fait accompli would go a long way toward convincing many Libyans and the international community that the NTC has the courage and vision to compromise with its adversary . \nNo matter how repugnant and seemingly unfair such a compromise would be - for example , that Gadhafi and those close to him are provided with immunity and are allowed to leave Libya - such a move would add to the NTC 's leadership credentials . \nIt would also serve as one small but symbolically important step in setting Libya on its way toward the kind of national reconciliation that will need to follow any resolution of the conflict . \nThe NTC should also realize that its current impasse over negotiations pales in comparison to its most difficult challenges in forging a united Libya , bringing the eastern and western parts of the country back together . \nStarting serious negotiations with Tripoli would be a significant step in creating a greater consensus - a step the United States and the international community should encourage , preferably through the UN special envoy to Libya , Abdul Ilah al-Khatib . \nIf the rebels fail to overcome their growing fault lines and their reluctance to compromise , they may well win the war but lose the larger battle : the true unification of Libya as a modern state and nation , in which both former loyalists and former rebels can co-exist . \nThe views expressed in this article are solely those of Dirk Vandewalle . \nYou Mr Dirk Vandewalle our a puppet to the devil , and if Libyan peoples win in the dice loaded conflict , I will do my utmost to see those responsible suffer the same fate they imposed on the Victims brutality and Slaughter . \nFor whats good for the goose is good for the gander , and the whole world will agree , but we shall which way it all goes . \nBut if they win the Western Leaders will not sleep easy in the beds remember WW2 The High and Mighty ended , the way of the Victims and some feet first . . \nAugust 18 , 2011 at 4:28 pm | Reply I doubt if the civil war in Libya will be over by the end of Ramadan , in 10 days time . \nTo capture Tripoli is not going to be an easy endgame , as many civilians there are determined to defend their city . \nI hope the Western forces wo n't get themselves stung in this hornet 's nest ! \nAugust 18 , 2011 at 5:13 pm | Reply `` The views expressed in this article are Solely those of Dirk Vandewalle .

{"id": "238", "time": "2011-08-18", "text": "NATO says rebel forces are taking control of the territory around Tripoli Experts caution that both rebels and pro-Gadhafi forces have claimed big advances before Gadhafi is under huge international pressure to step down as leader The North African country has been riven by conflict for the past five months -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The conflict in Libya has at times seemed as much a war of words as a war on the ground , with both the Gadhafi government and the rebel forces claiming to hold the upper hand . \nBut could reports of significant rebel advances in recent days signal a decisive shift in momentum to their side , after months of apparent stalemate ? \nCol. Roland Lavoie , a spokesman for NATO 's military operation , told reporters Tuesday that `` anti-Gadhafi forces are now assuming control of the key approaches to Tripoli , '' the Gadhafi-held capital which has long eluded the rebels ' grasp . \nDescribing the advances as `` the most significant anti-Gadhafi territorial gain we have seen in months , '' he painted a picture of Gadhafi 's forces on the back foot , losing `` considerable grounds '' on several fronts , as the rebels advance into the west . \nNATO deputy spokeswoman Carmen Romero also spoke of the use by government forces of an unguided short-range ballistic missile in a civilian area as a sign that `` Gadhafi and his regime are desperate . '' \nAnd an impassioned audio address by Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi earlier this week in which he called on his people to `` be ready to fight to liberate our pure and good land '' could suggest he is under mounting pressure . \nThe rebels themselves say they are now poised to seize the key town of al-Zawiya , which lies on a strategic supply route about 30 miles -LRB- 50 kilometers -RRB- to the west of Tripoli , and then to advance on the capital within days . \nSupporters outside the North African country are similarly optimistic . \nDr. Mahmoud Traina , a 31-year-old Libyan-American cardiologist in southern California , called the rebel push into Zawiya in recent days `` a turning point , '' since Gadhafi had fought hard to maintain control of the coastal city . \n`` It shows the weakening of his regime , '' Traina , who was born in the Untied States but has family in Tripoli and Misrata , told CNN in a telephone interview . \n`` It cuts off his supply routes for his last remaining supply of fuel , and cuts supply lines for all products from Tunisia . '' \nHe added : `` I think this is the end-game move before he 's out of power . \nAt this point , it 's only a matter of time . '' \nBut whether such hopes are well-founded is up for debate . \nRepresentatives of the Gadhafi government still maintain that it is doing well -- and analysts differ over what might happen next . \nProfessor Malcolm Chalmers , a UK defense policy expert at the Royal United Services Institute in London , believes the military momentum is now with the rebels , after a period in which they made no advances . \n`` This has always been a war of attrition by NATO , based on the view that over time the capabilities of the regime would continue to diminish and at some stage -- especially since Gadhafi 's forces were having to fight on several fronts at once -- would start to crumble , '' he said . \n`` And indeed , that seems to be what 's happening . '' \nThe progressive degrading of Gadhafi 's military capabilities by NATO strikes has levelled the playing field for the rebels , he said , who are also now benefiting from more access to funds . \n`` It 's become more and more difficult for -LRB- Gadhafi 's forces -RRB- to retake ground that they lose because their offensive weaponry is being destroyed , and their command and control ability is being destroyed , '' he said . \nIf rebel gains mean the regime forces also lose their re-supply routes from Tunisia , as seems likely , `` that is going to accelerate the decline in military capability , '' Chalmers said , adding that he does not see them lasting `` more than one or two months , maybe less . '' \nHowever , Simon Henderson , a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy , told CNN it was still too early to say whether the end-game was in sight . \n`` There has been so much to-ing and fro-ing in terms of advance and retreat by both sides , it 's hard to make the judgment at the moment that the opposition has made significant and permanent gains , '' he said . \n`` It 's still too early to say that the end of this is going to be a complete defeat of Gadhafi 's forces , '' he said , pointing to the fact that despite months of fighting the rebels have not managed to take Tripoli . \n`` It still seems as though Gadhafi is a long way from being pushed out , '' he said . \nSenior U.S. officials also caution that the rebels made real advances in the first months of the campaign , only to lose them and for the situation to remain stagnant for a while . \nThe officials , who spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity , say the current advances are `` significant , '' but that it remains to be seen how long Gadhafi can hang on and what supplies he still has . \nThey say the end for Gadhafi 's regime could be tomorrow , or could still be a long way off . \nNobody really wants to predict when it might come , they say -- but it wo n't be until people in Tripoli sense the end is near and rise up . \nObservers note that NATO action has been key to almost every significant gain the rebels have made so far in the five-month-old war -- and some question whether NATO is going beyond its mission of protecting the civilian population if it continues to target Gadhafi 's forces when they are on the defensive . \nLavoie disputed that Tuesday , saying that the only side NATO took was `` the side of the people of Libya '' and that any targets hit were those that represented `` a threat to the local population . '' \nAlthough NATO says the rebels effectively control the territory around Tripoli , it is still by no means certain they can take the capital , a Gadhafi stronghold . \nAfter 42 years in power , the Libyan leader still commands the loyalty of many people and the city regularly witnesses large pro-Gadhafi rallies . \nWhile the rebels have now held towns along the way to Zawiya for the past few days , they have not so far been able completely to take control of Zawiya itself . \nAnd residents fleeing Tripoli told CNN they believed that if the rebels can not coordinate an attack from several fronts they will struggle to succeed , as almost all roads in and out of the capital are shut or heavily monitored by government forces . \nNonetheless , Col. Ahmed Banni , military spokesman for the opposition National Transitional Council , said Tuesday that rebels hope to enter the capital by the end of the month . \nRebel commander Col. Radwan Heid struck a similar note of optimism . \n`` These are the last days , God willing , '' he told CNN , referring to Gadhafi 's grip on the capital and the country as a whole . \nMorale among rebel troops in and around the western Nafusa mountains -- where NATO says local people feel safe enough from attacks by pro-Gadhafi forces to start to return -- also seems high , observers say . \nBut a spokesman for Gadhafi , Ibrahim Musa , offered a different view this week . \nHe said the government was `` doing very well '' despite problems with `` armed gangs '' in the coastal towns of Surman and Sabratha , which NATO said rebel forces had reached . \n`` God willing , we are able to lead this battle successfully . \nWe will achieve peace and victory , '' Musa said . \nAt a news conference Thursday , Libyan Prime Minister al-Baghdadi al-Mahmoodi said that the military is `` powerful enough to finish this battle '' to its advantage , but warned that the cost would be too high , calling again for dialogue to resolve the crisis peacefully rather than militarily . \nAl-Mahmoodi said the government 's call for a peaceful resolution comes from `` a position of power , not weakness ... we are able to continue the fight , but from the very beginning we chose peace . '' \nThe government was currently in talks with all parties , he added . \nIf the rebels ' military advances outstrip such diplomatic efforts , what might lie ahead for Libya ? \nChalmers said that may hinge on whether people within the Gadhafi regime decide the game is up . \n`` One very plausible scenario for the next stage is that there will be people within the regime other than the Gadhafi family who seek to negotiate a cease-fire and a political settlement which involves the Gadhafi family leaving in some shape or form , but does n't involve a rebel military advance into Tripoli , '' he said . \nHowever , political divisions within the rebel ranks make it hard to be confident that they can form a credible national government even if they do achieve a military victory over Gadhafi 's government , Chalmers added . \nThe big worry over the next month , he said , is that the regime simply collapses , leaving the country to fall into a mess of tribal rivalries and reprisals against government supporters , with Islamist groups also getting involved . \n`` It now looks as if the days of the Gadhafi regime itself are numbered , but who knows who will replace it ? '' \nHenderson agrees that the rebel forces `` still fail to impress . '' \nTheir credibility was not improved by the murky killing last month of Gen. Abdul Fattah Younis in Benghazi , the city where the rebels ' Transitional National Council -LRB- TNC -RRB- is based , he said . \n`` They are far from being a united front and after the death of Younis they are short of professional leadership , '' Henderson said . \nSaad Djebbar , an international lawyer who negotiated the release in Scotland two years ago of Abdelbaset al-Megrahi , the man convicted of blowing up a Pan-Am flight over Lockerbie , believes it is vital to establish what he called a `` coalition of cultures '' which represents all regions , tribes and factions to ensure a stable Libya post-Gadhafi . \nHe called on the international community to facilitate that coalition because `` Libyans do n't have the expertise to do it '' -- and told CNN Gadhafi is `` losing power by the minute . '' \nOmar Turbi , the Libyan-born president of a computer company who moved to the United States aged 18 and now lives in Laguna Beach , California , agrees that Gadhafi 's grip on power is weakening . \nThe proximity of rebel forces to Gadhafi 's power base in Tripoli `` is a clear indication that he does n't have any fighting or any kind of power to fight , '' he said . \nTurbi , who says he works closely with the TNC in an unofficial capacity , said it planned efforts to prevent looting and reprisals once the Gadhafi regime falls . \nHe speculated that the Gadhafi government would last no more than 30 days . \n`` We have a pretty strong feeling that something is up , '' he said . \nMaybe in a few days , things will start to crumble . '' \nLooking ahead , he said he hoped that any new government would incorporate all elements of Libyan society except for those with blood on their hands . \n`` Everyone in Libya should be welcomed back to take part in building the country or keeping the country together . '' \nMansour El-Kikhia , 59 , a Libyan scholar and dissident , also predicted Gadhafi 's downfall within days . \n`` He 's going , he 's going down , '' he said . \n`` It 's just a matter of time , that 's all . \nI bet you , maybe 15 more days .

'' \nTo the west , in Tripoli , antiaircraft fire followed several thunderous explosions , and Libyan state television reported civilian casualties from NATO airstrikes . \nThe attacks came as the alliance chief asked for more precision fighter jets in order to avoid civilian deaths . \nAt a NATO summit in Berlin , Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen told reporters that NATO has the necessary assets to continue aerial strikes , but the tactical nature of the fight has changed . \n`` Now they hide their heavy arms in populated areas , where before many targets were easier to get to , '' Rasmussen said . \n`` To avoid civilian casualties , we need very sophisticated equipment . \nSo , we need a few more precision fighter ground-attack aircraft for air-to-ground missions . '' \nWith the conflict at a deadly impasse , Britain and France have been pressuring NATO to step up airstrikes . \nIn a joint op-ed that will appear Friday in three European newspapers , U.S. President Barack Obama , French President Nicolas Sarkozy and United Kingdom Prime Minister David Cameron wrote about their vision of Libya 's `` pathway to peace . '' \nIs NATO doing enough in Libya ? \nLibyan rebels plea to NATO `` We are convinced that better times lie ahead for the people of LIbya , '' they wrote . \nThey likened the fighting in Misrata to a `` medieval siege . '' \nThe White House released text of the opinion piece , which called on the Libyan troops to return to their barracks . \n`` Our duty and our mandate under U.N.

Michael Mullen and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton -- have all said enacting a no-fly zone is complicated and risky , and international support for the idea is not there yet . \n`` If it 's ordered , we can do it , '' Gates said , but imposing a no-fly zone `` begins with an attack on Libya to destroy the air defenses . '' \nLibya 's deputy U.N. ambassador , Ibrahim al-Dabashi , appealed to the United Nations to impose a no-fly zone over the country after he broke with Gadhafi 's regime and expressed support for the protesters more than a week ago . \nU.S. President Barack Obama said Thursday the United States is examining a `` full range of options '' in the Libyan crisis . \nThere is a danger of a `` bloody stalemate '' in Libya , he said , adding that he wants to be sure the United States `` has the capacity to act quickly in event of humanitarian crisis .

'' \nThe president also warned that advisers to Gadhafi need to understand that they will be held accountable for any violence they perpetrate against civilians . \n`` They should know history is moving against Col. Gadhafi , '' Obama said . \nThe Arab League Wednesday rejected foreign intervention , saying Libya is facing `` an internal affair that is decided by the people and their governments . '' \nBut the league can not ignore the suffering of civilians and would consider the imposition of a no-fly zone in coordination with the African Union if fighting were to continue , said Hisham Yousef , chief of staff of the Arab League . \nGadhafi 's regime Thursday sought to create an impression that it still controls the vast majority of the country , with rebels in charge of only pockets . \nThe government organized a trip for a CNN crew to visit a refinery in Zawiya controlled by the government . \nRebels control the center of the city , but the refinery is on the outskirts . \nThe refinery , Libya 's second largest , is operating at 80 % of its capacity , officials told CNN 's Nic Robertson . \nManagers said that while the refinery had not come under attack , some staff members had been unable to get to work . \nUS , allies debate no-fly zone for Libya Libyan protests : Raw and online CNN crew witnesses air bombing in Libya Protesters calling for the ouster of longtime leader Gadhafi have taken to the streets for a third week amid clashes with government forces . \nHe has been in power for nearly 42 years . \nMusa Ibrahim , a spokesman for Gadhafi 's regime , told CNN , `` We need tribal intervention , social intervention to help us convince these people to come to the negotiating table . '' \nThe government spokesman denied any attacks on peaceful protesters despite numerous reports from the country of unarmed demonstrators being shot indiscriminately . \nMore than 1,000 people are reported to have been killed and many more injured during the protests , according to the United Nations . \nLibya 's ambassador to the United States has estimated that the death toll was about 2,000 . \nThe International Criminal Court Thursday said Gadhafi and some of his sons and advisers are under investigation for alleged crimes against humanity . \n`` I would like to use this opportunity to put them on notice , '' ICC prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo told CNN . \n`` I want to be clear : If their troops commit crimes , they could be made criminally responsible .

Previously , Lawrence had worked as a correspondent for CNN based out of the network 's Los Angeles and Chicago bureaus . \nHe is also a veteran of the U.S. Navy Reserve . \n-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The people 's revolt against Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi remains dangerous -- and fluid . \nOn Thursday , U.S. military aircraft and French charter jets joined efforts to get tens of thousands of people fleeing the fighting back home as the United Nations called for stepped-up aid to refugees . \nThe humanitarian gestures came a day after Gadhafi warned that `` thousands will die '' if the United States or its allies attack Libya , and Defense Secretary Robert Gates cautioned members of Congress of the difficulties that would be inherent in such a move . \nCNN.com turned to Pentagon correspondent Christopher Lawrence for some insights into the complexity of the situation . \nQuestion : The Arab League has said it is against any foreign intervention in Libya , even though it has called for Gadhafi to leave . \nIs it possible for the U.S. and its allies to work around this ? \nCalls for military action in Libya Tired , filthy and stuck at border Christopher Lawrence : The United States still has the ability to impose a successful no-fly zone , even without the Arab League , -LRB- but -RRB- Defense Secretary Robert Gates is extremely hesitant to project American military power into this conflict -- especially a highly visible symbol like U.S. fighter jets . \nQuestion : If a no-fly zone is to be enforced , Robert Gates has said it must begin with attacks against Libyan air defenses . \n`` That 's the way you do a no-fly zone , '' he told a House committee . \nHe also said such an engagement is not possible with a nation the size of Libya `` with the planes you would find on a single aircraft carrier .

'' \nContinuing unrest and violence has left experts warning of a major humanitarian disaster , as thousands of people flee across the borders into neighboring Tunisia and Egypt . \nSo what can the international community do to stop further bloodshed ? \nAnd will anything they do convince Gadhafi to step down after more than 40 years in power ? \nWhat about a no-fly zone to keep Libyan military aircraft out of the skies ? \nSome witnesses have accused pro-Gadhafi forces of firing on civilians from the air , but U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Michael Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , said Tuesday that these reports could not be confirmed . \nU.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the imposition of a no-fly zone was under consideration . \nBut Mullen said doing so would be `` an extraordinarily complex operation . '' \nAli Suleiman Aujali , the Libyan ambassador to the U.S. who broke with the Libyan government over the use of force against protesters , told CNN 's Wolf Blitzer that his people were being `` slaughtered like sheep '' and the international community needed to step in -- or else stop encouraging the uprising . \nShould US arm Libyan rebels ? \nJohn McCain pushes Libya no-fly zone `` They have to dominate the skies , they have to stop the march of the tanks towards Misrata and towards Tripoli , '' he said . \n`` They have to take measures to stop these massacres going on in my country . \nIf you ca n't act now , then do n't encourage us to die . '' \nJohn Bellinger , a former legal adviser to the U.S. State Department , told CNN , `` Legally , there is no authority for the United States or any other country to do that under international law unless authorized by the Security Council . \n`` Politically it could be quite problematic ... for the United States or NATO to begin shooting down Libyan aircraft , even in the face of the things that Gadhafi is doing against his own nationals . '' \nWhat role does the United Nations play ? \nThe United Nations Security Council has already taken some action against the Gadhafi regime , but it has not authorized the use of armed force . \nIts members met at the weekend and voted unanimously for sanctions , including an arms embargo , assets freeze , and a travel ban for Gadhafi , his family , and key associates . \nHowever , they did not support calls for a no-fly-zone , and any decision on whether to impose one is likely to have to wait for a further U.N. resolution . \nIf the U.N. did vote in favor of a no-fly-zone , NATO would likely play some role in enforcing it , but NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen insists no action could be taken without a U.N. mandate . \n`` A no-fly-zone is not a part of the U.N. Security Council resolution , and a far-reaching approach like that would require a U.N. Security Council mandate , '' he told CNN . \n`` It 's a hypothetical question at this stage , but if the issue is raised , and if there is a request -LRB- for cooperation -RRB- then the NATO council will consider it , but that 's not the case for the time being . \n`` We have started preparations for all eventualities , but I think it is a bit premature to outline any timeline . '' \nIs Italy 's decision to suspend its non-aggression pact significant ? \nIf any military action , such as enforcing a no-fly-zone , were to be taken , troops would likely have to use air bases in Italy . \nItaly is also home to the U.S. Navy 's Sixth Fleet . \nUnder a friendship treaty , signed three years ago by Gadhafi and Italian PM Silvio Berlusconi , Italy agreed to pay Libya compensation for its colonial rule of the country , and Libya pledged to help stem the tide of refugees heading for Italy from its shores . \nBut the pact also included a non-aggression clause , under which Italy promised not to allow its territories to be used to launch military operations against Libya . \nThe treaty was suspended over the weekend . \nWhat happens to Libya after Gadhafi ? \nExplain it to me : Libya unrest Possible military aid to Libya Explain it to me : Libya unrest Kurt Volker , a former U.S. ambassador to NATO , told CNN that Italy 's suspension of the pact would not immediately enable military operations to be launched from that country . \n`` If you 're really trying to think about military action , do you have some kind of authorization to do so ? \nYou would need a U.N. mandate and possibly a NATO declaration or both , and there is n't anything like that on the table at the moment , '' he said . \nAldo Amati , deputy press secretary for the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , insisted the treaty had not been suspended to pave the way for military action . \n`` There 's no connection , '' he told CNN . \n`` There 's no link between the two things . '' \nWhat about sanctions against the Gadhafi regime ? \nGadhafi is no stranger to sanctions : He was subject to them for many years following Libya 's refusal to hand over suspects in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie in 1988 , in which 270 people were killed . \nThis time around though , the international community has taken further action , freezing the Libyan leader 's assets and those of his family and the regime . \nThe U.S. alone has blocked access to at least $ 30 billion in Libyan government assets , the largest amount ever blocked under a sanctions program . \nTravel bans too are likely to impact the Gadhafi family 's jet-setting lifestyle . \nWhat will the U.S. do ? \nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton insists that : `` Nothing is off the table , so long as the Libyan government continues to threaten and kill Libyan citizens . '' \nHowever , analysts say it seems unlikely that that the U.S. would launch attacks on Libya without a U.N. mandate . \nRosemary Hollis , Professor of Middle East Policy Studies at City University London , said : `` The messy fact of Afghanistan and Iraq has been to deter any kind of gung-ho notion that you can sort our any very foreign country by force . '' \nBut some prominent figures have called for other forms of military action to be taken - and quickly . \nSenator John McCain -LRB- R-Arizona -RRB- is one of those urging the introduction of a no-fly-zone : `` Libyan pilots are n't going to fly if there 's a no-fly-zone . '' \nAnd Senator Joe Lieberman -LRB- I-Connecticut -RRB- has gone one further , arguing that as well as offering aid to the rebels , the U.S. should be supplying them with weapons . \nThomas Donnelly , of the American Enterprise Institute , says the mere sight of U.S. fighter jets over Libya would send a powerful message to Gadhafi . \n`` Even if we just buzzed the palace and did n't release any ordnance , the symbolic action or the psychological effect could be enough to bring the war to a quick conclusion , '' he said . \nThe U.S. military is already close by : At least one destroyer is in the Mediterranean , and the amphibious assault ship the USS Kearsarge is in the Red Sea , close to the Suez Canal . \nThe Kearsarge is well equipped to deal with casualties : it houses a floating hospital -- including six operating theaters -- which can care for up to 600 patients . \nThe aircraft carrier USS Enterprise and its strike group are also in the region , able to move closer , if needed . \nHowever , Hollis said without a U.N. resolution , action remains unlikely . \n`` The only way I think they would launch military action without a clear U.N. mandate is by covertly supporting the opposition on the ground , '' she said . \n"}

'' \nAiding the opposition is also complicated , officials said , because of the lack of clarity about the capability , motives and strength of the disparate groups comprising the opposition . \nWhite House and State Department officials said Friday that even though the opposition is arming itself and fighting the government , that does not entitle Gadhafi to fight his own people . \nGadhafi , officials said , lost his legitimacy when his forces fired on innocent protesters . \n`` It is the people of Libya that are forced to defend themselves in light of the aggression that the Libyan regime has carried on , not just a military forces , but by these mercenaries that are in the employment of Colonel Gadhafi , '' State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said . \n`` The unrest is aimed at ending his rule , his oppressive and violent rule , and we believe that that would result in a more peaceful Libya and would allow the Libyan people to take the kind of steps that they want to take towards a representative democratic government that addresses their legitimate grievances and respects their aspirations , '' said White House spokesman Jay Carney . \nEarlier in the week , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the situation demands `` a strong and strategic American response . '' \n`` In the years ahead , Libya could become a peaceful democracy , or it could face protracted civil war , or it could descend into chaos . \nThe stakes are high , '' said Clinton . \nLibya being in a civil war would `` neither enhance or diminish your right as a third party actor to intervene , '' but the foremost consideration needs to be whether Gadhafi is needlessly cruel to the people of Libya , said Ruth Wedgwood , professor at Johns Hopkins School of International Advanced Studies . \n`` Can a government defend itself ? \nYes , '' Wedgwood said . \n`` Can a government use means that are grotesquely excessive ? \nNo. '' CNN 's Barbara Starr contributed to this report . \n"}

'' \nThe Zawiya tribe , based in a petroleum-rich region in the east , threatened to cut off oil flow . \nThe Bani Walid tribe decided to withdraw its men from the regime 's security brigades . \nAnd the influential Zintan tribe , allied in the past to Gadhafi 's own tribe , broadcast a statement of support for the opposition . \nOne after another , Libya 's myriad tribes are falling in line against Gadhafi , and the implications are enormous , said longtime observers of Libya , because for centuries , tribes have formed the backbone of the North African nation . \nMany Americans pride themselves on God and country . \nIn Libya , it 's God , tribe , then country . \nRefugees flee Libya for Tunisia No-fly zone in Libya explained Who is the opposition in Libya ? \nLibya 's 140 or so tribes and the clan and family structure that fall under them remain the most important aspect of a society that lags behind many others in the region in development , said Ronald Bruce St. John , a scholar who has visited Libya numerous times and published several books about the country . \nWith the exception of the Red Crescent Society and the Boy Scouts , few civil society institutions exist anymore in Libya , crushed by four decades of Gadhafi 's authoritarian rule . \nThere are no trade unions , PTAs or Lions Clubs . \nThe tribes have filled those gaps and because of that , they have perhaps taken on a stronger role in Libya than in other Arab nations . \n`` Libyans have a strong loyalty to tribe , '' said Philip Carl Salzman , a McGill University professor of anthropology and author of `` Culture and Conflict in the Middle East . '' \n`` A tribe provides welfare in times of need , '' he said . \n`` They have a collective responsibility . '' \nIf one member of a tribe is attacked , the reaction is to help or exact vengeance , Salzman said . \nTribes are especially involved in resolving family disputes . \nGadhafi recognized the power of his nation 's tribes when he seized control in 1969 . \nHe saw tribal leaders as traditional forces opposed to his radical socialist agenda , St. John said , and , at first , he tried to suppress them . \nBut later he tried to co-opt them , establishing a People 's Social Leadership Committee , which essentially was a collection of tribal leaders . \nSt. John said it was Gadhafi 's way of telling the tribes : You are now responsible for your people . \nIf any member steps out of line , we expect you to discipline him or her . \nThe committee 's creation followed an abortive coup supported by the Warfallah tribe , whose members formed a chunk of the military . \nLSE head quits over Libya links Celebs under fire for Libya concerts According to a U.S. State Department document , Gadhafi `` began to purge the military periodically , eliminating potential rivals and inserting his own loyal followers in their place . '' \nHe filled the higher echelons of the military and elite government posts with members of his own Gadhadfa tribe , but pitted them against others . \nGadhafi 's actions back then reflected Libya 's lack of nongovernmental organizations and the strongman 's official recognition of tribes in his own ideological manifesto , `` The Green Book , '' said St. John . \nNow , almost two decades later , tribal elders may hold the cards to their national future . \nLibya 's tribes have never wielded political power , but if Gadhafi falls , it 's likely that a provisional government would resemble a patchwork of their leaders , Salzman said . \n`` I think the tribal elders would have to meet from different tribes and agree on some kind of structure , '' Salzman said . \nThe problem , said Salzman , may lie in divisions between East and West that sprouted in Roman times with the carving of Libya into three states : Tripolitania in the west , Cyrenaica in the east and Fezzan in the south . \nThe states and the tribes that lived in each remained independent until 1931 when Italian colonizers put down a rebellion with brute force and unified Libya again . \nBut the nation was split again when Italy was defeated in World War II -- Tripolitania and Cyrenaica were controlled by the British and Fezza , by the French . \nA unified and independent Libya emerged in 1951 but the east-west tribal divisions remained deep , said St. John , because the king , a scholar of religion from the east , showed little interest in running his country . \n`` King Idris was a poor monarch , '' St. John said . \n`` He was disinterested in government . \nHe was a religious scholar interested in tribal affairs . \nThe eastern tribes benefited from Idris more so than the western tribes . '' \nGadhafi always saw the tribes in eastern Libya as natural opponents , St. John said . \nNow , with the Libyan crisis sliding closer to war , the embattled leader is sure to see other tribes in the same vein . \nFor now , several tribes in the west and south are reportedly loyal to Gadhafi , among them Gadhafi 's own tribe and the Magariha , the tribe of the Lockerbie bomber Abdelbeset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi . \nBut the powerful Warfallah have already defected as have the Zintan , one of the first towns in western Libya that revolted last month . \nIn a recent speech delivered on state television , Gadhafi 's son Saif a-Islam Gadhafi , blamed Libya 's unrest on tribal factions and warned of civil war with members of different tribes `` killing each other in the streets '' . \nBut when they rose up to fight their Italian colonizers , Libya 's tribes stood as one against a common enemy . \nGadhafi 's foes are hoping for that unity again . \nA November 18 , 1922 , New York Times story began this way : `` The latest to enter the Near Eastern struggle are the Bedouins of Tripolitania and Ceryainica , who are reported to have sunk their local differences and united ... to expel the Italians and establish their own government . '' \nThe article went went on to raise speculation on how long the tribes , who have fought each other for generations , could stay united to fight someone else . \nAlmost a century later , the same question seems eerily relevant . \n"}

'' \nIt was unclear who controlled the city . \nJohn McCain pushes Libya no-fly zone People in Zawiya , west of Tripoli , and `` their public leadership have secured and took control over the city from the armed terrorist elements , '' state TV reported . \nLibyan government spokesman Majid al - Dursi told CNN that `` Zawiya has been captured , Zawiya has been liberated . '' \nHowever , the witness said protesters retained some control inside the city , which security forces were surrounding . \n`` They -LRB- Gadhafi 's forces -RRB- have n't been in control and they never were in control , '' said one rebel fighter , who said his forces lost seven men in fighting in Zawiya on Friday , versus what he said were some 20 casualties among government fighters . \nReferring to Gadhafi , he said , `` All the man has left is his lies . '' \nBy late Friday , the situation was quiet , he said . \n`` However , we 're surrounded by three areas -- the east , the west and the south . '' \nAt least 15 people died and 200 others were wounded in the city , according to one doctor , who said there was `` a river of blood '' at the hospital where the wounded were being treated . \n`` The situation is very bad , '' he said , adding that the facility was short of medical supplies . \nIt was not clear if the casualties at the hospital were wounded during the Martyrs Square confrontation . \nThe doctor said the wounded started arriving at the hospital Friday morning , and most of the wounds were from gunshots . \nIn the capital city of Tripoli , security forces aboard flatbed trucks shot tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse crowds of protesters who had formed after Friday prayers in the Tajura neighborhood , witnesses said . \nGovernment officials would not allow CNN into Tajura , whose outskirts were patrolled by a heavy security presence . \nSecurity forces were searching cars along the Corniche , a main street in the city . \nTired , filthy and stuck at border Who is the opposition in Libya ? \nWitnesses said anti-government protesters hid journalists in abandoned buildings and helped move them from location to location so that they could report firsthand in safety . \nNear Green Square , in the center of the city , anti-government protesters emerged from a mosque to find pro-government supporters outside . \nPolice intervened and fired shots in the air to head off a confrontation , ushering the anti-government protesters back into the mosque for their safety . \nIn the eastern city of Ras Lanuf , meanwhile , forces loyal to Gadhafi fought with opposition members Friday , opposition fighters and commanders said . \nThuds could be heard in the distance , indicating heavy fighting around the city itself . \n`` It 's a war , '' said CNN 's Ben Wedeman , in Ras Lanuf . \n`` The protests are now over . '' \nHe described seeing truckloads of people `` organizing themselves in a rather haphazard way '' and headed toward the front with no command-and-control structure . \n`` It 's complete chaos , really , '' Wedeman said . \nSuch clashes have spurred throngs of people to flee the country . \nThe number of people trying to leave the country has declined in recent days , however , as heavily armed government forces have intensified their presence at the Tunisian border and on roads leading up to it , the United Nations refugee agency said Friday . \n`` We are concerned that the presence of the forces and the large drop in evacuees could mean that people are being prevented from leaving , '' said Sybella Wilkes , a spokeswoman for the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees . \nRoughly 15,000 people had been crossing the border every day , but that number plunged to fewer than 2,000 per day on Thursday and Friday . \nIn all , 200,000 people have fled Libya , according to the International Organization for Migration , which has been working with the U.N. refugee agency on mass evacuations . \nMeanwhile , a doctor on the northwestern town of Misrata said it was attacked by forces loyal to Gadhafi . \nThe assailants fired at doctors and ambulances , the doctor said . \n`` We are holding our city , we are trying to protect our city , '' the doctor told CNN Friday morning . \n`` We are doing our job in the hospital and trying to treat everybody . \nThis morning , they shot at our ambulances . \nOne of them exploded ... they shot at our doctors .

'' \nThe United States is exploring a `` full range '' of options , Obama said Thursday . \nAnalysts said the Iraq war has prompted nations to be more cautious . \n`` We went into Iraq with a very dubious understanding of the situation on the ground , '' Christopher Hill , a former U.S. ambassador to Iraq , told CNN . \n`` So I think there is some concern about whether refugee reports are entirely accurate in a sort of macro sense . '' \nHe added , `` I think what the president is trying to do is to try to build diplomatic support and see where we can go with this . \nAnd I think it would be highly problematic if he just jumped into something . '' \nThe Arab League has rejected international intervention , saying Libya is facing `` an internal affair that is decided by the people and their governments . '' \nBut the league can not ignore the suffering of civilians and would consider the imposition of a no-fly zone in coordination with the African Union if fighting were to continue , said Hisham Yousef , chief of staff of the Arab League . \nThe protests have left more than 1,000 people dead and many more injured , according to the United Nations . \nLibya 's ambassador to the United States has estimated that the death toll was about 2,000 . \nThe United Nations has proved to be a sore point for the Libyan government . \nOn Friday , the United Nations said it was studying Libya 's request to install a more loyal diplomat as its ambassador . \nA letter from Libya 's government asked that former Foreign Minister Ali Abdussalam Treki be approved as its envoy . \nTreki would replace Mohamed Shalgham as ambassador in New York . \nShalgham and his deputy , Ibrahim Dabbashi , have denounced Gadhafi and requested that he stop leading Libya . \nA separate letter from Libya to the United Nations demanded that Shalgham and Dabbashi be denied the right to speak for Libya . \nIn emotional scenes last week , the New York-based ambassadors were hugged by fellow ambassadors after the Libyans criticized Gadhafi and pleaded in the Security Council chamber for international assistance to the country . \nU.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky said the situation `` is complicated '' and that the world body 's legal office was looking into the dueling diplomats ' situation . \nThe International Criminal Court said Thursday that Gadhafi and some of his sons and advisers are under investigation for alleged crimes against humanity . \nVenezuela 's president has said Gadhafi is receptive to the idea of an international commission coming to the country . \nThe two heads of state spoke this week . \n`` I consulted with him . \nI asked him if he was willing to accept a commission of countries , '' Hugo Chavez said on state-run VTV Thursday night . \nCNN 's Nic Robertson , Ben Wedeman , Jill Dougherty , Catherine E.

'' \nAbdel Hafiz Ghoga , deputy chairman of Libya 's National Transitional Council , the country 's opposition body , said Wednesday night that international delegates had agreed to make the funds available . \nLibyan rebels plea to NATO Al-Obeidy : ` Please do not forget me ' Ghoga said more than $ 100 billion in regime funds would be unfrozen and made available to the opposition , though he did not say which country or countries would release the funds , or when . \nHe also said rebels requested that NATO intensify its airstrikes and protection of the civilian population . \nThe funding decision came amid a grim assessment of the humanitarian fallout from the Libyan conflict and reports of mounting civilian casualties . \nUnited Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the delegates that in a worst-case scenario , as many as 3.6 million strife-affected people could eventually require help , and that the money to provide that help has been slow in coming . \nSo far the United Nations has seen only 39 % of the $ 310 million it requested in emergency funding , `` clearly insufficient given the prospective need , '' Ban said . \n`` It is critical that the international community act in concert , that we speak with one voice , and that we continue to work in common cause on behalf of the Libyan people , '' he said . \nThe international delegates were meeting with Libyan opposition leaders in an attempt to work out a peaceful end to the deadly impasse in the North African nation . \nDespite a NATO-led aerial campaign and rebels fighting on the ground , leader Moammar Gadhafi has shown no signs of acquiescing . \nAmong the high-profile attendees in Doha is Gadhafi 's former intelligence chief and foreign minister , Moussa Koussa , who fled to Britain last month . \nGhoga said Koussa was not invited to any of the meetings , however . \n`` Nobody from the National Transitional Council even considered meeting up with him , '' Ghoga said . \n`` It is our belief that Moussa Koussa was seeking to get residency in Doha , or future residency . '' \nRebel spokesman Shamsiddin Abdulmolah had said the opposition was open to meeting with Koussa if he first made clear , in writing , what he has to offer . \nThe Libyan Contact Group was formed after a London conference on Libya last month . \nThe first meeting in Doha comes as civilian casualties continued to mount . \nThe besieged western city of Misrata has been especially vulnerable . \nGadhafi 's tanks have been pounding the city , where several more people were killed Wednesday , Abdulmolah said . \nTuesday , a doctor told CNN , at least 10 people were killed and 30 were wounded . \nU.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Wednesday that Gadhafi 's forces have reportedly destroyed crucial food supply warehouses in Misrata and cut off water and power to the city `` in an apparent attempt to starve -LRB- residents -RRB- into submission . '' \nSnipers have targeted Misrata residents seeking medical attention , she said . \nA military official said on state-run television that NATO `` airstrikes hit Misrata 's main road of Tripoli Street , resulting in civilian casualties . '' \nThe official said the towns of al-Sbai ` ah , Aziziyah and Sirte were also hit by `` the colonial crusader enemy . '' \nU.S. fighter jets have continued to fly bombing missions in the NATO-led campaign , Pentagon spokesman Col. David Lapan said Wednesday , although U.S. officials had previously indicated in public comments that the U.S. mission had become limited to providing support , including refueling and electronic jamming . \nLapan said the U.S. aircraft assigned to NATO are ordered to defend the pilots who are enforcing the no-fly zone , and nothing more . \nNATO , he said , must still request U.S. strike aircraft should they want them for offensive operations . \nBritish Foreign Secretary William Hague and French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe both called Tuesday for NATO to get more aggressive with the airstrikes in Libya , and opposition members urged the international community to implement the U.N. Security Council resolution that calls for `` all necessary measures to protect civilians under threat of attack . '' \nLibyan National Transitional Council member Ali Issawi said the rebels should be supported with military supplies . \nHe said the Libyan people ought to have the right to defend themselves . \nGhoga said the opposition has submitted a wish list of military equipment to Qatar and France . \nHe said the list was compiled by rebel military leaders , but he did n't know exactly what was being requested . \n`` I do n't think there 's going to be a problem in getting military equipment in , '' Ghoga said . \nQatari Prime Minister Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani , a co-chair of Wednesday 's meeting , said the opposition 's international allies will consider the needs . \n`` Of course we will look at it and make things available for the Libyan people to defend themselves , '' he said . \nLibyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim accused Qatar late Wednesday of providing rebels in eastern Libya with Milan anti-tank warheads , but he did not say when . \nThere was no immediate response from the Qatari government . \nA week ago , a CNN team in eastern Libya saw the rebels with Milan anti-tank missiles , which they did n't have before . \nFighters said they obtained the missiles from the transitional government in Benghazi but did n't know where they came from . \nMBDA , the multinational missile manufacturer that makes the Milan missile , says it is in service in 43 countries around the world . \nIt does not list those countries , but the military analysis site GlobalSecurity.org says the Milan missiles are used by the Qatari armed forces . \n`` The message to Gadhafi is clear , '' the Qatari prime minister said . \n`` He should use his head and those who are around him should advise him that it is in the interest of Libya , and if he is interested in Libya , then he should relinquish power and leave the Libyan people to decide their own destiny . '' \nHague said arming the rebels would not necessarily mean violating an arms embargo imposed on Libya . \n`` We understand the resolutions to mean the arms embargo applies to the whole of Libya , but that in certain circumstances it is possible , consistent with those resolutions , to provide people with the means to defend the civilian population , '' he said . \nThe Doha meeting follows an effort earlier this week by the African Union to forge a peace plan that had been accepted in principle by Gadhafi . \nGhoga and fellow rebel leader Mustafa Abdul Jalil rejected it on grounds that it did not provide any solutions to violence against the Libyan people . \nMeanwhile in Germany , the foreign ministry said it had summoned the Libyan ambassador to inform him of the expulsion of five Libyan diplomats . \nThey will have to leave Germany within seven days because of accusations that they intimidated Libyan citizens in Germany . \nCNN 's Mohammed Jamjoom , Reza Sayah and Frederik Pleitgen contributed to this report \n"}

'' \nSome bakery owners were giving away bread , and a few stores on the other side of town remained open , she said . \nAs of Monday night , the seaside city remained surrounded on three sides , she said . \nLast week , Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Khaim said that Gadhafi 's military was withdrawing from Misrata and that tribal leaders would deal with the rebels . \nBut rebel commanders told Colvin that there were no negotiations going on between them and tribal leaders , the reporter said . \nThe government 's assertion that such talks were ongoing `` appears to be a fig leaf or Gadhafi trying to cover the fact that his troops have been defeated , '' Colvin said . \nMisrata has been the scene of some of the deadliest battles of the war as rebels attempt to oust Gadhafi , who has been in power for 42 years . \nAt least 36 people were killed there Sunday , rebel spokesman Col. Ahmad Bani said Monday . \nIn all , hundreds of people have been killed in the battle for the city , which has been under siege by Gadhafi 's forces for seven weeks . \nIts population of about 450,000 makes it the country 's third-largest city . \nBut that number has been dropping as residents have sought to get out . \nOn Monday , the International Organization for Migration said it had taken nearly 1,000 stranded migrants -- most of them from Nigeria -- and 17 civilian casualties from Misrata to Benghazi on Sunday , with more such efforts planned . \nThe accounts of dire conditions in Misrata came as a government official said Gadhafi was well and in command of the country 's affairs , despite what the official called a NATO attempt to kill him by bombing his compound in the capital city of Tripoli . \n`` The message that was sent by NATO in the early hours of this morning was sent to the wrong address , '' Mussa Ibrahim said in a written statement . \nIn a tour of the aftermath , Ibrahim said the flattened structure was a civilian office building . \nIn a statement , NATO said the target was a communications center in central Tripoli that had been used to coordinate attacks against civilians . \nNATO is leading an international military operation in Libya that includes airstrikes targeting Gadhafi 's military resources . \nIt is operating under a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing the use of force to protect civilians . \nOn Monday , Italy 's Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi called U.S. President Barack Obama to tell him of his decision to provide additional military support by authorizing air-to-ground strikes on Libyan regime targets , the White House said in a statement . \n`` The two leaders agreed that additional pressure is necessary to strengthen the civilian protection mission , and the president emphasized that the best way to ensure the safety of the Libyan people is for Gadhafi to leave power , '' the statement said . \nLibyan state TV said military and civilian casualties resulted from the strike on Gadhafi 's Bab el-Azizia compound . \n`` We have no independent means of verifying reports of possible civilian casualties , '' NATO said in a statement on its website . \nNATO has been issuing warnings to Libyan civilians to stay away from military sites and equipment , especially around Misrata . \nCiting a military source , state-run Libyan TV reported late Monday that NATO ships struck an offshore fiber-optic cable , cutting communications to Sirte , Ras Lanuf and al-Brega . \nIt also reported that air strikes hit targets Monday night in Zawiya and Ayn Zarah of Tripoli district , resulting in casualties . \nSince NATO took command of Operation Unified Protector on March 31 , its aircraft have flown more than 3,700 sorties and more than 1,500 strike sorties . \nOver the weekend , NATO aircraft destroyed multiple-rocket launchers , armored personnel carriers , bunkers and storage facilities in and around Misrata , Tripoli and Sirte , the alliance said . \n`` We are bringing all our capabilities to bear on all parts of the Gadhafi regime that remain intent on harming the civilian population , '' NATO spokeswoman Oana Lungescu said in a statement . \n`` As decided by the foreign ministers of NATO and operational partners , we will keep up the pressure until all attacks against civilians have stopped , Gadhafi 's forces have withdrawn to bases , and full and unimpeded humanitarian access has been ensured .

'' \nHe added that the residents of Libya 's third-largest city have been in the grip of the conflict . \n`` The tactic of the Libyan army is to have a surgical solution , but it does n't work , '' Khaim said . \n`` With the airstrikes , it does not work . \nWe will leave it for the tribes and Misrata people to deal with the situation -- either to use force or negotiations . '' \nHe added , `` The tribal leaders have issued an ultimatum to the military saying they will deal with the situation if the military can not do it . \n... They will speak with the rebels and , if there is no solution , they will fight the rebels . '' \nIn the rebel stronghold of Benghazi , in the east , rebel spokesman Ahmed Bani reacted to Khaim 's comments with laughter and derision . \n`` This only confirms that he wants to save face , '' Bani said of Gadhafi . \n`` This confirms that our rebels in Misrata have liberated Misrata and that Libya is still in one piece , not two , the way Gadhafi hoped . \nIn regards to the tribes fighting the rebels ; how would you believe that a person will fight his brother ? \nAnd who are the tribes that are supporting Gadhafi , anyway ? '' \nHe predicted that if Gadhafi forces leave Misrata , `` it will mean that this game is over . '' \nBut he added that he did not necessarily believe they will . \nEarlier Friday , Bani said that Libyan rebels had wrested control of a key building in Misrata and made other advances in the city . \n`` This victory is quite important for us , and it shows that we are advancing and we are heading in the right direction , '' Bani told CNN about the rebels ' control of the National Insurance Building , which is on the main thoroughfare , Tripoli Street . \nIts height provided snipers with a clear view of surrounding streets . \nBani said some fighters loyal to Gadhafi were negotiating to surrender their weapons to the rebels in exchange for the rebels ' assurances that they would not be harmed . \nBut the carnage of recent days was on display at the city 's hospitals , where doctors were working long hours and beds were full . \nGadhafi 's forces retain control of roads that lead to the seacoast city . \nBut access by sea remains open , and on Friday another aid ship chartered by the International Organization for Migration left Benghazi for Misrata carrying food , medicine and other supplies . \nThe organization said it hopes to rescue more casualties and stranded migrants from the city . \n`` Given the increasing number of casualties in Misrata and the thousands of lives that are in danger , we felt a responsibility to act , '' said Foreign Minister Eamon Gilmore of Ireland , which is helping fund the chartered vessels . \n`` Colonel Gadhafi 's forces have agreed to allow ships into the port to evacuate civilians and we have requested that the IOM undertake an emergency operation on our behalf , '' Gilmore said . \nAt a news conference in Baghdad , America 's top military chief acknowledged a stalemate on Libya 's eastern front , around the oil towns of Ajdabiya and al-Brega , both of which have changed hands several times . \n`` The regime forces have changed their tactics , and changed it in a way where they essentially look like the opposition forces , so it 's become a much more difficult fight , '' U.S. Navy Adm. Mike Mullen , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , told reporters . \n`` And as I 've observed in recent days , essentially it is very much stalemate-like in the vicinity of Ajdabiya and al-Brega , '' Mullen said . \nHe said the outcome -- toppling Gadhafi after nearly 42 years of rule -- is certain . \nBut the timing , he said , is `` difficult to predict . '' \nAlso Friday , Sen. John McCain made an unannounced visit to Benghazi , the rebel stronghold , where residents welcomed him . \nSome waved American flags , some chanted , `` Thank you John McCain ! \nGadhafi go away ! '' \nThe senator from Arizona 's arrival came a day after the United States said it was deploying drones to Libya . \nMcCain , a proponent of beefing up U.S. efforts to oust Gadhafi , said the drones will increase NATO 's capability but not enough to break a `` significant degree of stalemate . '' \nThough he opposes sending U.S. ground troops to Libya , he said the international community needs to `` facilitate '' weapons and training for the rebels . \nMcCain , the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit Libya since the conflict erupted in February , challenged critics of intervention to tour Benghazi , as he did Friday , to see a `` powerful and hopeful example of what a free Libya can be . '' \nThe top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee stopped by a hospital and suggested that Western powers are not doing enough for the rebels . \n`` Let 's face it : This is not a fair fight , '' said McCain , a decorated Vietnam veteran with clout in defense circles . \n`` Maybe we should be doing everything we can to help these people and maybe we 're not , and they 're dying .

Darryn James . \nU.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said earlier that bad weather forced the deployed drones to return . \nLibya 's deputy foreign minister told reporters that the decision reflects poorly on U.S. President Barack Obama . \n`` He is involving himself in a dirty game , '' Khaim said . \n`` This is will be another crime against humanity committed by the American administration and I feel very sad for President Obama to be involved in such a thing .

'' \nOn Thursday , the Royal Air Force spoke of `` precision strikes on former regime facilities at Sabratah -LRB- west of Tripoli -RRB- , including a commando base which had been used by Colonel Gadhafi 's men to launch numerous reprisals against the local people . '' \nBut such missions are invariably close to areas where the rebels are trying to break through . \nIn recent weeks , sustained NATO strikes around Brega , Misrata and in the western Nafusa mountains have helped tip the military balance in the rebels ' favor , to the point that Gadhafi 's opponents have become reluctant to enter the fray until air power has softened up the enemy . \nDerek Flood , a journalist and analyst with the Jamestown Foundation , has just spent several weeks in western Libya . \n`` I found the rebels had become almost overly dependent on NATO to the point they would n't act without NATO actually softening up the targets first . '' \nRebels gaining ground in Tripoli Libyan rebels claim critical victory Video : Libyan rebels free prisoners Most recently , rebel efforts to take the vitally important town of Zawiyah , just 30 miles west of Tripoli , were preceded by several days of NATO sorties . \nNATO lists about a dozen `` key hits '' around Zawiyah in the past five days . \nThe Royal Air Force also targeted a boat commandeered by several Libyan soldiers to get out of Zawiyah , but a statement said that `` since it was clear from their actions that these troops continued to pose a threat to the local population , the RAF patrol engaged the ship , '' which was destroyed . \nThere appears to be growing coordination between NATO and rebel military commanders . \nVideo footage emerged at the beginning of this month of a column of rebel tanks and pickup trucks , outside the city of Brega in eastern Libya , daubed with orange paint to distinguish them from government forces and ensure they were n't erroneously bombed . \nIn previous days , NATO planes had hit several pro-regime targets around Brega . \nOn a fluid battlefield , where military assets are poorly marked and often hidden in civilian areas , NATO needs forward air controllers to help with targeting . \n`` Western air forces do n't bomb without that direct ability to visualize the battlefield , especially when the regime has placed so many of its assets within civilian protected areas , '' Zenko says . \nNATO spokesman Colonel Roland Lavoie was pressed on the issue at a news briefing last month . \n`` NATO does not have direct coordination with opposition forces or rebel forces in Brega , '' he said . \nBut he added : `` We follow the situation through allied information sources that are in the area . '' \nNATO wo n't comment on such arrangements . \nThe arms embargo has been liberally interpreted by some , with Qatar and France supplying the rebels with weapons and military advice . \nQatar is reported to have supplied the rebels with antitank missiles , flying them into Benghazi . \nAnd Derek Flood said he believes Qatar was also getting weapons to the rebels via the Tunisian border . \nIn the western mountains `` there was support on the ground from Qatari officials as well as Emirati officials , '' he said . \nTunisian officials deny weapons are crossing their border . \nNeither Qatar nor the United Arab Emirates have commented on such involvement . \nFrance acknowledged in June that it had air-dropped assault rifles and ammunition to Berber militia groups in the western mountains but said they were to help civilians protect themselves . \nAt sea , NATO has operated a blockade -- in accordance with U.N. resolutions -- to prevent any resupply of Gadhafi forces . \nBut in one instance in May a Canadian frigate stopped a rebel tugboat carrying howitzer rounds , ammunition and `` lots of explosives '' from Benghazi to Misrata . \nNATO commanders allowed the vessel to proceed on the grounds that it was moving from one Libyan port to another . \nMore recently , there was the murky case of the oil tanker Cartagena , a vessel owned by the Libyan government but stranded at sea with 30,000 tons of gasoline since May . \nRebels boarded the ship in international waters and diverted it to Benghazi with NATO permission . \nThe unknown : Did the rebels have help in seizing the ship ? \nIt 's not the sort of operation they are used to . \nNATO 's mission has shifted in another way . \nAfter hitting more than 3,000 military targets -- from ammunition dumps to tanks to radar and command-and-control facilities -- there are not many more left . \nSo it has turned to the regime 's infrastructure . \nThe satellite dishes of Libyan state TV were bombed on the grounds that the broadcaster was being used to `` incite violence . '' \nThe radar at Tripoli airport also was taken out , and the sprawling Gadhafi compound in Tripoli has been targeted several times . \nNATO officials say operations will continue for as long as it takes , though how long it takes to do what is an open question . \nNATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen has said repeatedly that the conflict can only end with a political solution , but the outlines of such a solution are far from clear . \nZenko says the goal from early on has been regime change , and the latest tactic is to try to cut off all economic and outside supplies to make it cease functioning . \nWhile the Libyan regime has lost access to much of the country and is losing critical routes to the east , west and south , Derek Flood says it appears to retain control of border crossings in the Sahara desert -- from Algeria , Chad and Niger . \nThe military balance has tipped in the rebels ' favor . \nFlood says the capture by rebels of the important road junction at Gharyan 80 kilometers south of Tripoli can only further isolate the regime , cutting off fuel supplies from Algeria . \nEven so , it still controls large tracts of a vast country . \nNATO 's current mandate in Libya expires at the end of September . \nIts members may yet be asked to extend it once again . \n"}

'' \nHe said that the Libyan capital remains under government control , adding that the nearby highways remain open . \nHe blamed small groups of `` armed gangs '' -- a term that Gadhafi loyalists have frequently applied to rebels -- for the blasts and gunfire heard overnight Saturday inside Tripoli . \nHe insisted that government forces had put down the fighters `` within half an hour , '' making the statement at the same time gunfire continued to crackle intermittently around the capital . \nAbout two hours later , Moammar Gadhafi echoed his spokesman in claiming rebel officials were lying about the situation in Tripoli and beyond while predicting the six-month-long conflict would climax soon . \nIn his audio address , broadcast on state-run TV , the Libyan leader blasted the rebel `` traitors '' and the NATO forces backing them as unethical and intent on destroying the county and ruining lives . \nAnd as he had done in a speech six days earlier , he tried to rally citizens to his side . \n`` A great thing , anyway , that despite the Christian air raids , you continue to be up in Tripoli , '' he said , an apparent reference to those who listened to his speech from Green Square . \n`` March forward , march forward , march forward . \n` Mayhem has broken out in Tripoli ' Libya rejects rebel claims about Gadhafi What could Libya be after Gadhafi ? \n`` They have lost and used everything , and their last resort is their lying campaign . \nNow , this is the ending , '' he added . \nThe rebel spokesman , Jumma Ibrahim , claimed opposition fighters control the main intelligence operations building in Tripoli . \nHe also said some Libyan army personnel had defected and joined the rebels in the vicinity of the capital 's airport , which he claimed the rebels were able to take over with their newfound support . \nMusa Ibrahim , the government spokesman , denied that the airport had switched hands -- insisting , as with the rest of Tripoli , it was safe and under the control of Gadhafi 's forces . \nCNN could not immediately confirm how significant the fighting was , including whether rebel fighters had taken control of any parts of the city , including the airport . \nJumma Ibrahim , the rebel spokesman , said the clashes in Tripoli were `` planned by rebels inside Tripoli in the neighborhoods of Fashloum , Souq al-Juma , Ben Ashur ... and other places . '' \nThis came after coordination with other anti-Gadhafi elements , added Baja . \nMusa Ibrahim confirmed that armed men had entered those three neighborhoods in the capital , but said they were confronted and defeated in a matter of minutes . \nHours earlier , Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim rejected rebel claims that the governments of Egypt , Morocco , Tunisia and Algeria have been asked to accept Gadhafi and his family . \nAnd Gadhafi , in his speech early Sunday morning , stated unequivocally that he is still in Libya . \nOfficials from the United States and NATO , whose forces have launched scores of strikes on Gadhafi 's forces , also said they have no indication the Libyan leader is making preparations to leave . \nWhatever his next move , international pressure on Gadhafi appears to be growing . \nTunisia -- Libya 's western neighbor that , until now , had been neutral in the conflict -- joined a host of other nations in recognizing the Transitional National Council as Libya 's legitimate government . \nA U.S. official said Friday that Gadhafi might be preparing for a `` last stand '' in Tripoli as a months-long NATO air campaign continues amid reports of rebel advances . \nA second U.S. official said the longtime leader 's plan could involve a final military offensive against civilians , launched from his last major strongholds around the Libyan capital . \nThe officials , who have knowledge of the situation on the ground , did not want to be named because of the sensitive intelligence matters . \nWhile uncertain of how upcoming events will unfold , State Department spokesman Mark Toner said Friday that U.S. officials in Benghazi have been working with the Libyan opposition `` on exactly what it 's going to look like post-Gadhafi . '' \n`` Impossible to say when he 'll go , but it 's clear that he will go , '' Toner told CNN . \nThe fighting continues , meanwhile , on a number of fronts , including in the west , where fighting has raged for days over the strategic city of Zawiya , about 30 miles west of Tripoli and a major supply route to the capital . \nOn Saturday , it appeared the rebels had taken control of all of Zawiya after pushing Gadhafi 's forces beyond the east gate , according to CNN 's Sara Sidner who is in the city . \nArtillery fire could be heard , and mortars were launched toward Zawiya on Saturday , she reported . \nRebel fighters told Sidner that NATO had warned civilians to leave the main part of the city . \nNATO has not yet commented on that statement . \nMusa Ibrahim , the Libyan government spokesman , said late Saturday that Gadhafi 's forces are surrounding Zawiya and still control it . \nEarlier , the rebels seized a major oil refinery in Zawiya and controlled only the western part of the city , said Hobab Jomaa , a rebel fighter . \nBut Saif al-Islam Gadhafi sarcastically laughed at the idea the opposition would take Tripoli . \nAnd he was emphatic that he , his father and their supporters would not surrender . \n`` We are in our land , in our country , '' he said . \n`` We have no problem if it takes six months , one year or two years -- victory will be ours . \nThis is our country , and we will not leave it .

\nStorms in the Atlantic Ocean are given names when they become hurricanes . \nThey get names when they are classified as tropical storms , which is one level below a hurricane . \nAZUZ : The 9th storm to get a name might be the first hurricane of the 2011 Atlantic season . \nForecasters predict that Tropical Storm Irene is picking up strength as it moves toward islands in the Caribbean Sea . \nOn Sunday afternoon , Irene had wind speeds around 50 miles per hour . \nWo n't be considered a hurricane until those wind speeds reach 74 miles per hour . \nExperts think that could happen very soon . \nOfficials announced hurricane warnings for Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic yesterday . \nSome predictions estimated that Irene could dump up to 20 inches of rain on parts of the Dominican Republic . \nThere 's concern that heavy rain could trigger mudslides there ; that has happened before . \nAZUZ : Vice President Joe Biden has finished a trip to China . \nBut this was the scene when he arrived in the country last Wednesday . \nHe was there for five days meeting with Chinese leaders , and the biggest issue discussed during his visit was the U.S. economy . \nChina has bought more U.S. debt that any other foreign country . \nSo , officials there are concerned about America 's ability to manage that debt . \nDuring one speech , Vice President Biden explained why it 's important for the U.S. to protect Chinese and American investors . \nU.S. VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN : I read that some Chinese are concerned about your safety of your investments in American assets . \nBut please understand no one cares more about this than we do , since Americans own 87 % of all our financial assets and 69 % of all our treasury bonds , while China owns 1 % of our financial assets and 8 % of our treasury bills , respectively . \nAZUZ : All right , shifting gears now . \nAbout 1.6 billion people -- just over a fifth of the world 's population -- are Muslim . \nAnd we 're in the middle of the most sacred time on the Muslim calendar . \nIt 's called Ramadan , and it lasts for an entire month . \nAlthough there are disagreements about when exactly that month starts . \nDan Gilgoff explains that -- and more -- about this observance . \nDAN GILGOFF , CNN.COM RELIGION EDITOR : Ramadan is the Islamic month of fasting . \nIt 's meant to be a month of reflection , prayer and charity , detachment from worldly affairs . \nA month of purification . \nIt 's one of the 5 pillars , or duties , of Islam . \nRamadan is believed to be the month during which the prophet Mohammed started receiving the divine revelation , the Quran , or the Muslim holy book , from God , or Allah . \nAnd so , the most holy night during Ramadan -- and of the entire Islamic year -- is called the night of power , and that 's the night which it is believed that Allah did start to reveal the text of the Quran to the prophet Mohammed in the year 610 . \nRamadan is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar . \nAnd the Islamic calendar operates according to the lunar cycle , the cycle of the moon . \nAnd so every year , Ramadan moves up around 11 days earlier than the previous year . \nIt 's supposed to begin with the sighting of the first new moon of that cycle . \nAnd every year , there are debates about when that first new moon becomes visible , so that various countries believe that they see the first new moon on various days and Ramadan will begin on different days in different countries . \nThe fast is broken each night with what 's called the iftar meal , and it 's a meal that 's often times communal or banquet-style meal that 's eaten in a mosque . \nThe fast each night is often broken with dates , which is believed to have dated to the time of Mohammed . \nEvery year during Ramadan the international sale of dates just skyrockets . \nThe month of Ramadan ends with the holiday called Eid ul-Fitr . \nIt 's often simply just referred to as Eid . \nIt is the start of the next lunar month after Ramadan . \nIt 's a break the fast holiday that 's marked by a lot of celebrations and feasting with friends and families . \nA lot of mosques hold carnivals for a couple of days after Ramadan ends . \nTOMEKA JONES , CNN STUDENT NEWS : Time for the Shoutout ! \nWhat historic figure once said , `` out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope '' ? \nIf you think you know it , shout it out ! \nWas it : A -RRB- Queen Elizabeth II , B -RRB- Martin Luther King Jr. , C -RRB- John F.

Miftah Omar Hamzah told CNN that 50 carloads of loyalist forces remained in al-Brega , but he insisted that the Gadhafi troops were on the defensive . \nNew al-Brega , a suburban area of the homes of workers at a nearby oil refinery , was partially under rebel control . \nOpposition officers said they were still clearing the area of Gadhafi forces , and a resident fleeing the area told CNN that it is still unsafe . \nThere have been no NATO airstrikes in the area for at least 24 hours , he said . \nThe perceived lack of airstrikes enforcing a U.N. resolution to protect civilians from Gadhafi 's forces and enforce an arms embargo brought criticism from a rebel spokesman on Monday . \n`` You are supposed to be implementing this resolution and clearly it 's not implemented in Misrata , it 's not implemented in Zintan or Zahwiya , and we 're wondering where are they ? '' \nIn Misrata , destruction permeated the city , which has been choked off by pro-Gadhafi forces . \nRebels , Gadhafi forces clash in oil town Wounded treated on hospital ship The battle for medical aid in Libya How Libyan government treats media An opposition councilman in Misrata told CNN that a tank entered the outskirts of the city about 3 a.m. Monday and headed for the port area . \nOpposition fighters descended on the area and fought for two hours to force the tank to turn back , which it eventually did , the councilman said . \nThe councilman said he could hear NATO jets flying overhead Monday afternoon for the first time in 36 hours . \n`` We need a lot of help in Misrata . \nThere 's so much death there , '' said Mustafa Abdul Hamali , a 46-year-old taxi driver who lost half a leg . \n`` I was driving in my car with my wife , and my car just blew up . \nI do n't know what happened . '' \nOn Monday , British Foreign Secretary William Hague ruled out his country from arming the rebels but said it would provide them telecommunications equipment , given the urgent need on the ground . \n`` We are prepared to supply nonlethal equipment which will help with the protection of civilian lives and the delivery of humanitarian aid , '' he said . \nLibyan rebels have been hampered by a lack of organization and training on heavy weaponry when confronting the better-trained , better-armed forces of Gadhafi , who is under investigation for alleged crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court . \n`` We were fighting with light weapons , but they had so much more , '' said Khalid Moteridi , 32 , a businessman who was fighting with the rebels when , he said , he was shot twice in the legs by a sniper . \n`` Artillery , mortars , rocket-propelled grenades , anti-tank rockets -- that 's how they were fighting back . '' \nWhile Hague 's statement seemed to rule out the United Kingdom from arming the rebels , U.S. officials have yet to say whether they will do so . \nBoth countries participated in airstrikes to weaken Gadhafi 's military resources before NATO officially took command of the international operation . \nDue to poor weather conditions in recent days , the United States approved a request by NATO to extend the use of some U.S. strike aircraft , NATO spokeswoman Oana Lungescu said Sunday . \n`` This is a short-term extension , which expires on Monday , '' Lungescu said . \nMoteridi said the situation in Misrata has turned dire . \n`` It 's a tragedy by all means , '' he said . \n`` No electricity , no food , no water . \nWe 're trapped from all sides by the Gadhafi forces . '' \nA doctor in Misrata told CNN that government forces shelled a clinic , leaving one dead and 15 injured Sunday . \nLast week , a hospital official said 398 people have been killed since the Libyan conflict began last month . \nHe feared there were more deaths that his hospital did n't know about . \nDiplomatic efforts to end the crisis seemed no closer to success Monday . \nItalian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini on Monday said proposals outlined by an envoy whom Gadhafi sent to Greece were `` not credible '' and said his country would become the third to recognize the rebel Libyan National Transitional Council as the legitimate international representative of Libya . \nFrance and Qatar previously granted the rebel council similar status . \nThe nature of the message delivered by Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelati Obeidi was not immediately known . \n`` From what the Libyan envoy said , it is clear that the administration is looking for a solution , '' Greek Foreign Minister Dimitris Droutsas said after the meeting . \nHe said Obeidi is expected to continue talks in Turkey and Malta . \nSome rebels from Misrata got a bit of a reprieve Sunday when a Turkish hospital ship picked up more than 300 of the wounded fighters . \nTheir injuries included amputated limbs , broken bones and shrapnel wounds . \nThe ship is destined for the Turkish port of Cesme , where the patients will receive medical attention , opposition officials said . \nIt made a stop in the rebel capital of Benghazi to pick up more patients and supplies , and was greeted by cheering supporters of the opposition . \nMen wearing head bandages and eye patches waved back at the crowd . \nWest of Benghazi , the tug-of-war for control continued in al-Brega , which has changed hands six times in six weeks between government and opposition forces . \nRebel fighters retreated east of al-Brega on Sunday , reporting an ambush , roadside mines and a need for more ammunition . \nOver the weekend , opposition spokesmen said 13 rebels were killed when NATO airstrikes hit several vehicles . \n`` Based on the information we have , they -LRB- the opposition forces who were hit -RRB- heard the airstrikes and went ahead to see what the damage was , and that 's when they got hit , '' rebel spokesman Shamsiddin Abdulmolah said . \n`` They were told to stay back , but they jumped the gun . '' \nLungescu , the NATO spokeswoman , said Saturday that NATO was investigating the incident . \n`` NATO takes any reports of civilian casualties very seriously , but exact details are hard to verify , as we have no reliable sources on the ground , '' she said . \nDespite the unyielding conflict , Moteridi , the rebel fighter who was shot twice in the legs by a sniper , said he wo n't give up . \n`` I 'll go back to Misrata when I get better , God willing , and ...

'' \nAl-Obeidy said she spent 72 hours under interrogation after being dragged away from the Tripoli hotel where she tried to tell journalists about her alleged abuse . \nInterrogators poured water on her face and threw food at her during the relentless questioning , which ended only after she was examined by a doctor to prove she had been raped , al-Obeidy said . \n`` And when the test came , it verified that I was raped and tortured ... then I was freed . '' \nShe said the public statements from a state TV anchor and government officials , who initially called her mentally ill , drunk and a prostitute , have ruined her reputation . \nAl-Obeidy said her spirits and morale are low and that she has nightmares now . \n`` They did not give me a chance to respond , '' she said . \nThe attempt to discredit al-Obeidy as a promiscuous , un-Islamic woman ties into the idea of sexual shaming in a conservative Muslim society where it 's commonly believed that a woman who has been raped has lost her honor , said Mona Eltahawy , a columnist on Arab and Muslim issues . \nWoman alleges rape by Gadhafi forces Libyan woman speaks out about rape For a woman in such a society to come forward to claim she has been raped is no small thing . \n`` No one would do that unless they were raped , and especially in a conservative society , '' Eltahawy told CNN . \nAl-Obeidy burst into the Rixos Hotel in Tripoli on March 26 while international journalists staying there were having breakfast . \nShe told reporters she had been taken from a checkpoint east of Tripoli , held against her will for two days and raped by 15 men . \n`` They had my hands tied behind me , and they had my legs tied , and they would hit me , while I was tied and bite me in my body . \nAnd they would pour alcohol in my eyes so that I would not be able to see and they would sodomize me with their rifles , and they would not let us go to the bathroom . \nWe were not allowed to eat or drink , '' she told CNN 's `` AC360 , '' speaking through a translator . \n`` One man would leave and another would enter . \nHe would finish and then another man would come in , '' al-Obeidy said . \nShe said another woman being held captive was able to untie her hands and feet , allowing al-Obeidy to escape . \nWhen CNN saw her in March , al-Obeidy 's legs and face were bruised and she had blood on her right inner thigh . \nHer visible injuries appeared to support her allegations , but CNN could not independently verify her story . \nGovernment officials tried to subdue her , scuffling with reporters in the process and eventually dragged her away . \nAl-Obeidy said she is no longer in government custody and has spent time with her sister . \nBut she said she can not leave the house where she is staying as officials from the police or army will pursue her . \nShe said that when she tries to leave the house , officials chase her down and take her to a police station . \nBut police do n't know what to do with her since she is not charged with a crime , and she is released . \nAl-Obeidy said she has been abducted by Gadhafi forces three times -- the first time from the hotel , the second time when she tried to escape to Tunisia last week and a third time on Sunday . \nShe said the abduction Sunday and accompanying threats were an effort to prevent her from taking her complaints to a police investigations unit . \nIn spite of the danger , al-Obeidy said the most important thing to her is that her voice reaches the world . \n`` I would like to direct a word to all the people watching us in America that we are a peaceful people and we are not members of al Qaeda . \nWe are a simple people and moderate Muslims -- not extremists -- and we are not asking for anything expect for our freedom and dignity and the most basic human rights which are denied to us , '' she said . \nHer father said Monday he has still not spoken to his daughter and begged the international community to come to her aid . \n`` What is happening to her is wrong . \nWhat can I do ? \nI have no power to do anything . \nI urge the human rights organizations and all international humanitarian movements to get involved and help us , '' said Atiq Al-Obeidy . \nCNN 's `` AC360 '' spoke with al-Obeidy Sunday and Monday . \nCNN conducted a third phone interview with her Monday . \nCNN 's Saad Abedine contributed to this report . \nWatch Anderson Cooper 360 weeknights 10pm ET . \nFor the latest from AC360 click here . \n"}

'' \nMeanwhile , the United States agreed to extend until Monday the use of its strike aircraft over Libya due to poor weather conditions over the past few days , NATO spokesman Oana Lungescu said . \n`` These aircraft will continue to conduct and support alliance air-to-ground missions throughout this weekend , '' he said . \nThe deadly battles in Libya forged ahead Sunday as pro-government forces shelled a medical clinic in the city of Misrata , killing one person and wounding 15 others , a hospital source said . \nThe source , a doctor who was not identified for security reasons , told CNN two people were injured by an initial mortar blast . \nThe rest of the injured were wounded by a second mortar blast when they went to the scene of the first attack to help victims . \nZakaria debriefs former Libyan jihadi Mourning a voice for freedom One of the injured is a 14-year-old child who suffered a fractured skull and is in a coma , the doctor said Sunday . \nThe clinic that was attacked had evacuated patients because of recent attacks , said another doctor at a Misrata hospital that received the patients . \nBut it was being guarded by opposition `` fighters and young people '' who were injured . \nElsewhere in the city , the sound of heavy shelling was heard coming from the port area , a resident said . \nHe said troops supporting Libyan ruler Moammar Gadhafi surrounded the city , with snipers perched on rooftops of buildings . \nMisrata 's port is under the control of the rebels and is considered the main site of aid for the people in the embattled city . \nA bombing in the port area could prevent aid ships from reaching Misrata . \nSunday 's events are the latest in the struggle between forces loyal to Gadhafi and opposition members seeking an end to his nearly 42-year rule . \nRebel fighters retreated east of the oil town al-Brega on Sunday . \nFighters said there was some sort of ambush , they saw roadside mines and they needed to get more ammunition . \nThey regrouped about 30 to 35 kilometers -LRB- 181\\/2 to 22 miles -RRB- east of al-Brega . \nNATO is leading international military operations in the country following a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing force and the enforcement of a no-fly zone to protect civilians . \nNATO airstrikes hit several rebel vehicles and killed at least 13 rebel fighters , spokesmen for the Libyan opposition said Saturday . \nSeven others were wounded . \n`` Based on the information we have , they -LRB- the opposition forces who were hit -RRB- heard the airstrikes and went ahead to see what the damage was , and that 's when they got hit , '' rebel spokesman Shamsiddin Abdulmolah said . \n`` They were told to stay back , but they jumped the gun . '' \nNATO was investigating the incident , a spokeswoman said Saturday . \n`` NATO takes any reports of civilian casualties very seriously , but exact details are hard to verify , as we have no reliable sources on the ground , '' NATO 's Lungescu said . \nOn Saturday , notions of a cease-fire in the country quickly faded as a battle for control continued in al-Brega . \nIt was not immediately clear who had control of the coastal city , which has changed hands six times in as many weeks under the dramatically shifting circumstances of the Libyan war . \nA former Obama national security adviser said Sunday that the international coalition in Libya can not leave the country until Gadhafi leaves power . \n`` The problem is that while everybody wants to see Gadhafi leave , either be removed or leave on his own , that end state is not yet clear , '' Ret . \nGen. Jim Jones said Sunday on CNN 's `` State of the Union . '' \n`` Unfortunately most people want perfect clarity in a situation where clarity does n't really exist yet . '' \nLast week , Libyan opposition leader Mustafa Abdul Jalil laid out cease-fire conditions that included freedom of expression for the Libyan people and the removal of snipers , mercenaries and militias from western cities . \nUltimately , he said , the opposition 's goal remains regime change in Libya . \nBut government officials spurned the opposition cease-fire proposal . \nGovernment spokesman Musa Ibrahim told reporters in Tripoli on Friday the offer included `` silly conditions . '' \n`` They are asking us to withdraw from our own cities and open our cities to people , who are holding up arms , who are tribal , violent , no unified leadership , al Qaeda links , and no one knows who they are , '' he said . \n`` If this is not mad , then I do n't know what it is . '' \nRebel spokesman Abdul Hafiz Ghoga sought to clarify the opposition 's position Saturday . \n`` There is no , and was no , negotiation on a cease-fire with Colonel Gadhafi 's dictatorship , '' he said at a news conference . \nHe repeated the opposition demands that Gadhafi halt all military action , end the sieges laid on cities like Misrata and allow free speech and assembly . \nSources close to Gadhafi have told CNN that political solutions are still possible but that the Libyan leader would relinquish power only to others within his inner circle . \nThe rebels have been hampered by a lack of organization and training on heavy weaponry when confronting the better-trained , better-armed forces of Gadhafi , who is under investigation for alleged crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court . \nCNN 's Ben Wedeman , Nic Robertson , Reza Sayah , Eve Bower and Yousuf Basil contributed to this report \n"}

\nHere is an article about that , with sources like the 2007 West Point Study and numerous others , all stated at the end of the article which you can read fully on the link below the excerpt `` Rebel Leaders Jalil and Younis , Plus Most of Rebel Council are Members of the al Qaeda-linked Harabi Tribe The result of the present inquiry is that the Libyan branch of Al Qaeda represents a continuum with the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group centered in Darnah and Benghazi . \nThe ethnic base of the Libyan Islamic fighting group is apparently to be found in the anti-Qaddafi Harabi tribe , the tribe which makes up the vast majority of the rebel council including the two dominant rebel leaders , Abdul Fatah Younis and Mustafa Abdul Jalil . \nThe evidence thus suggests that the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group , the elite of the Harabi tribe , and the rebel council supported by Obama all overlap for all practical purposes . \nAs the late Foreign Minister of Guyana Fred Wills , a real fighter against imperialism and neo-colonialism , taught me many years ago , political formations in developing countries -LRB- and not just there -RRB- are often a mask for ethnic and religious rivalries ; so it is in Libya . \nThe rebellion against Qaddafi is a toxic brew compounded of fanatical hatred of Qaddafi , Islamism , tribalism , and localism . \nFrom this point of view , Obama has foolishly chosen to take sides in a tribal war . \nWhen Hillary Clinton went to Paris to be introduced to the Libyan rebels by French President Sarkozy , she met the US-educated Libyan opposition leader Mahmoud Jibril , already known to readers of Wikileaks document dumps as a favorite of the US .16 While Jibril might be considered presentable in Paris , the real leaders of the Libyan insurrection would appear to be Jalil and Younis , both former ministers under Qaddafi . \nJalil seems to be the primus inter pares , at least for the moment : Mustafa Abdul Jalil or Abdul-Jalil -LRB- Arabic : , also transcribed Abdul-Jelil , Abd-al-Jalil , Abdel-Jalil or Abdeljalil ; and frequently but erroneously as Abud Al Jeleil -RRB- -LRB- born 1952 -RRB- is a Libyan politician . \nHe was the Minister of Justice -LRB- unofficially , the Secretary of the General People s Committee -RRB- under Colonel Muammar al-Gaddafi . \nAbdul Jalil has been identified as the Chairman of the National Transitional Council based in Benghazi although this position is contested by others in the uprising due to his past connections to Gaddafi s regime . \n17 As for Younis , he has been closely associated with Qaddafi since the 1968-9 seizure of power : Abdul Fatah Younis -LRB- Arabic : -RRB- is a senior military officer in Libya . \nHe held the rank of General and the post of Minister of Interior , but resigned on 22 February 2011 . \n18 What should concern us most is that both Jalil and Younis come from the Haribi tribe , the dominant one in northeast Libya , and the one that overlaps with al Qaeda . \nAccording to Stratfor , the Harabi tribe is a historically powerful umbrella tribe in eastern Libya that saw their influence wane under Col. Gadhafi . \nThe Libyan leader confiscated swaths of tribal members land and redistributed it to weaker and more loyal tribes . \nMany of the leaders now emerging in eastern Libya hail from the Harabi tribe , including the head of the provisional government set up in Benghazi , Abdel Mustafa Jalil , and Abdel Fatah Younis , who assumed a key leadership role over the defected military ranks early in the uprising . \n19 This is like a presidential ticket where both candidates are from the same state , except that Libya s ferocious tribal rivalries make the problem infinitely worse . \nThe Rebel Council : Half the Names Are Kept Secret ; Why ? \nThis picture of a narrow , sectarian tribal and regional base does not improve when we look at the rebel council as a whole . \nAccording to one recent version , the rebel council is chaired by the well-spoken former justice minister for Libya , Mustafa Abdul Jalil , -LRB- and -RRB- consists of 31 members , ostensibly representatives from across Libya , of whom many can not be named for security reasons . \nThe key players on the council , at least those who we know about , all hail from the north-eastern Harabi confederation of tribes . \nThese tribes have strong affiliations with Benghazi that date back to before the 1969 revolution which brought Gaddafi to power . \n20 Other accounts agree about the number of representatives : The council has 31 members ; the identities of several members has not been made public to protect their own safety . \n21 Given what we know about the extraordinary density of LIFG and all Qaeda fanatics in northeast Libya , we are authorized to wonder as to whether so many members of the council are being kept secret in order to protect them from Qaddafi , or whether the goal is to prevent them from being recognized in the west as al Qaeda terrorists or sympathizers . \nThe latter seems to be a more accurate summary of the real state of affairs . \nNames released so far include : Mustafa Abduljaleel ; Ashour Hamed Bourashed of Darna city ; Othman Suleiman El-Megyrahi of the Batnan area ; Al Butnan of the Egypt border and Tobruk ; Ahmed Abduraba Al-Abaar of Benghazi city ; Fathi Mohamed Baja of Benghazi city ; Abdelhafed Abdelkader Ghoga of Benghazi city ; Mr. Omar El-Hariri for Military Affairs ; and Dr. Mahmoud Jibril , Ibrahim El-Werfali and Dr. Ali Aziz Al-Eisawi for foreign affairs .22 The State Department needs to interrogate these figures , starting perhaps with Ashour Hamed Bourashed , the delegate from the terrorist and suicide bomber stronghold of Darnah . \nHow Many al Qaeda Members , Veterans , or Sympathizers are on the Rebel Council ? \nSeeing as clearly as we can in the fog of war , it looks like slightly more than a dozen of the members of the rebel council have had their names officially published in any case , not more than half of the reported 31 members . \nThe US and European media have not taken the lead in identifying for us the names that are now known , and they above all have not called attention to the majority of the rebel council who are still lurking in the shadows of total secrecy . \nWe must therefore demand to know how many LIFG and\\/or al Qaeda members , veterans , or sympathizers currently hold seats on the rebel council . \nWe are thus witnessing an attempt by the Harabi tribe to seize dominance over the 140 tribes of Libya . \nThe Harabi are already practically hegemonic among the tribes of Cyrenaica . \nAt the center of the Harabi Confederation is the Obeidat tribe , which is divided into 15 sub-tribes .23 All of this might be of purely academic ethnographic interest , were it not for the fact of the striking overlap between the Harabi tribe and the LIFG and al Qaeda .

\nEven US soldiers need extensive training on US weapons before they are ready for combat . \nUS-made weapons are quite complex , and they take a lot of maintenance . \nIn the dust and grim of the battlefield , particularly in Libya , these weapons would be useless unless there is adequate training and maintenance . \nRight now the rebels are using Soviet\\/Russian-made weapons captured from the Gaddafi forces . \nRPG-7 's , AK-74 's , 12.7 mm -LRB- .50 cal -RRB- heavy machine guns , Katyusha and Grad rocket launchers . \nThese weapons systems are robust require far less training to use . \nThey are `` point and shoot '' weapons , which the rebels have mastered in short period of time . \nThey also require far less maintenance than US-made weapons . \nWe should arm the rebels , but what do we do ? \nShould we buy Russian-made or -LRB- gulp -RRB- Chinese-made weapons . \nThat seems to be the logical choice , but it wo n't set well with the US taxpayer . \nAlso Russia and China both have distanced themselves from the Libyan intervention , though I am sure they will hold their nose and take the money , then deliver the weapons in unmarked ships to the NATO ports . \nApril 3 , 2011 at 10:19 pm | Reply Please do it please help my family , help the children in my country , help the Libyan people . \nHe is still bombing now he 's not just bombing the protesters , it 's everyone , even families in their houses . \nPlease when you think of this think of your children think of your family . \nDo you want this to happen to them ?

April 4 , 2011 at 2:29 am | Reply What I find ridiculous is the U.S. government has propped up the corrupt Libyan government for over 30 years because it was in their interest by way of cheap oil contracts . \nWhat is also ridiculous is that a no-fly zone or any action at all was not taken UNTIL Gadhafi announced he would no longer be honoring his oil contracts with Western Countries , and would be seeking to sign new contracts with the likes of Russia and China . \nThis entire problem is caused by powers such as and almost entirely by the U.S. and now they 're going to arm the people ? \nIs this an Iraq all over again ? \nI scratch my head when I see all of this going on . \nIf NATO was anything like it was 20 years or so ago , we would be sending in the `` blue helmets '' ensuring peace and bringing both parties to the table to discuss reasonable ways of resolving the problem , but that would require this situation to have to be about internal politics , and it 's really only all about OIL . \nI dream of the day when mankind will learn that profiteering and non renewable resources will be the source of our demise . \nThe U.S. has armed the Libyan army for three decades , and now will arm the rebels . \nEither way , the Libyan people will lose in all of this , because the interests of the U.S. will prevail . \nWhat really needs to happen is the U.S. population needs to wake up and demand transparency and honesty from its government and to quit meddling in other countries affairs , but that will most probably never happen because people would rather raise the flag way above their heads then to be aware of the horrific truth . \nApril 4 , 2011 at 2:31 am | Reply I totally agree with you ! \nIf it was n't tragic , it would be ridiculous , how the U.S and the rest of them keep playing the same tune over and over again when they need public support for their dirty wars , and still get away with it ! \nSo now they made a boogeyman out of Gaddafi ...

April 4 , 2011 at 7:37 am | Reply `` Darnah , northeast Libya : World Capital of Jihadis The most striking finding which emerges from the West Point study is that the corridor which goes from Benghazi to Tobruk , passing through the city of Darnah -LRB- also transliterated as Derna -RRB- them represents one of the greatest concentrations of jihadi terrorists to be found anywhere in the world , and by some measures can be regarded as the leading source of suicide bombers anywhere on the planet . \nDarnah , with one terrorist fighter sent into Iraq to kill Americans for every 1,000 to 1,500 persons of population , emerges as suicide bomber heaven , easily surpassing the closest competitor , which was Riyad , Saudi Arabia . '' '' \n... But since the Al Qaeda personnel files contain the residence or hometown of the foreign fighters in question , we can determine that the desire to travel to Iraq to kill Americans was not evenly distributed across Libya , but was highly concentrated precisely in those areas around Benghazi which are today the epicenters of the revolt against Colonel Gaddafi which the US , Britain , France , and others are so eagerly supporting . \nAs Daya Gamage of the Asia Tribune comments in a recent article on the West Point study , alarmingly for Western policymakers , most of the fighters came from eastern Libya , the center of the current uprising against Muammar el-Qaddafi . \nThe eastern Libyan city of Darnah sent more fighters to Iraq than any other single city or town , according to the West Point report . \nIt noted that 52 militants came to Iraq from Darnah , a city of just 80,000 people -LRB- the second-largest source of fighters was Riyadh , Saudi Arabia , which has a population of more than 4 million -RRB- . \nBenghazi , the capital of Libya s provisional government declared by the anti-Qaddafi rebels , sent in 21 fighters , again a disproportionate number of the whole . \n4 Obscure Darnah edged out metropolitan Riyadh by 52 fighters to 51 . \nQaddafi s stronghold of Tripoli , by contrast , barely shows up in the statistics at all . \n-LRB- See chart from West Point report , page 12 -RRB- '' You can find the West Point study here to download , or read excerpts . \nThe only way to get ready of international terrorism is by eliminating the power and reach of all tyrants like GADDAFY from the face of this plant . \nAll Tyrant should be picked and handed back to their own people to take care of them Once and for all . \nIf You guys -LRB- west -RRB- have change your mine about Gaddafy and decide to keep him or one of his sons around for any longer , then , I can assure you it will be the wrong signal sent to the world . \nGaddafy , his family and all of the gang surrounding him MUST GO OUT OF LIBYA NOW . \nApril 4 , 2011 at 7:47 am | Reply please help them because good people , and give them gun April 4 , 2011 at 7:56 am | Reply Rebels are not civilians !!!

Mummar has took every thing from them and now he is taking their SOULS April 6 , 2011 at 3:34 pm | Reply At this point , however , it must be asked who is the opposition in Libya . \nThe opposition is not a monolithic body . \nThe common denominator is the opposition to the rule of Qaddafi and his family . \nIt has to be said that actions of opposition or resistance against an oppressor and an opposition movement are also two different things . \nFor the most part , the common people and corrupt Libyan officials , who harbor deep-seated hate towards Qaddafi and his family , are now in the same camp , but there are differences . \nThere is an authentic form of opposition , which is not organized , and a systematic form of opposition , which is either external or led by figures from within the Libyan regime itself . \nThe authentic people s internal opposition in Libya is not organized and the people s actions of opposition have been spontaneous . \nYet , opposition and revolt has been encouraged and prompted from outside Libya through social media networks , international news stations , and events in the rest of the Arab World . \nThe leadership of the internal opposition that is emerging in Libya is coming from within the regime itself . \nCorrupt officials that have rebelled against Gaddafi are not the champions of the people . \nThese opposition figures are not opposed to tyranny ; they are merely opposed to the rule of Colonel Qaddafi and his family . \nAref Sharif and Al-Yunis are themselves Libyan regime figures . \nIt has to also be considered that some Libyan officials that have turned against Qaddafi are doing it to save themselves , while others in the future will work to retain or strengthen their positions . \nAbdel Moneim Al-Honi , the Libyan envoy to the Arab League in Cairo , can be looked at as an example . \nAl-Honi denounced Qaddafi , but it should be noted that he was one of the members of the group of Libyan officers who executed the coup in 1969 with Qaddafi and that later in 1975 he himself tried to take power in a failed coup . \nAfter the failed coup , he would flee Libya and only return in 1990 after Qaddafi pardoned him Al-Honi is not the only Libyan diplomat to resign . \nThe Libyan ambassador to India has also done the same . \nThere is an intention on the part of these officials to be members of the power structure in a Libya after the ouster of Qaddafi : Libyan Ambassador to India Ali al-Essawi told the BBC that he was quitting , opposing his government 's violent crackdown on demonstrators . \nMr. Al-Essawi was reported to be a Minister in Tripoli and could be an important figure in an alternative government , in case Libyan President Muammar Qadhafi steps down . \nThe second Libyan diplomat to put in his papers was Tripoli 's Permanent Representative to the Arab League Abdel Moneim al-Honi , who said in Cairo that he had quit his job to join the revolution in his country . \nI have submitted my resignation in protest against the acts of repression and violence against demonstrators , and I am joining the ranks of the revolution , said Mr. Al-Honi . \nThe Second Secretary Hussein Sadiq al Musrati , announced his resignation from China , in an interview with Al-Jazeera , and called on the Army to intervene in the uprising . \nThe leadership of the internal opposition that is emerging in Libya is coming from within the regime itself . \nCorrupt officials that have rebelled against Gaddafi are not the champions of the people . \nThese opposition figures are not opposed to tyranny ; they are merely opposed to the rule of Colonel Qaddafi and his family . \nAref Sharif and Al-Yunis are themselves Libyan regime figures . \nAny way everybody want to be Master of free -LRB- OIL -RRB- dom ... but they forget that is only one president can be in one country . \nYou can see on this map -LRB- down -RRB- only Libya is free ...

\nThe people in Libya are being shot with the same weapons which should be used to protect them . \nThese weapons were bought and paid for with the wealth of the nation that should have been used for the benefit of the people . \nLibya has no defensive army . \nIt has instead a highly armed `` palace guard '' designed to protect Muammar Ghaddafi and his family . \nNeither American or Libyan people want American solders on the ground in Libya . \nWhat the pro-democracy fighters in Libya do need is some support form NATO and training and weapons . \nThe United States is very good at verbally encouraging the spread of democracy and condemning the abuse of human rights . \nIn Libya right now , The United States has a unique opportunity to prove that it can do more than just talk the talk . \nThe pro-democracy movement in Libya is grass-roots and genuine . \nLibya is an example for other governments in the region who repress their people . \nIf the Libyan people are not given support in real tangible ways , like air strikes and weapons , other dictators will be confirmed in their beliefs that all The United States does is talk . \nBut , if America gives the pro-democracy fighters real support now , it will prove that America is more than just talk . \nAmerica walks the walk , America stands behind the pretty words about freedom , democracy and human rights . \nI am proud of my Libyan brothers and sisters fighting for freedom . \nI hope that I can be proud of my American brothers and sisters for standing behind what they believe and doing what should be done when it counts . \nApril 4 , 2011 at 6:41 pm | Reply Genocide or Armed Civil War Unlike all ongoing mass popular Arab uprisings , the Libyan conflict began as an armed insurrection , directed at seizing power by force . \nUnlike the autocratic rulers of Egypt and Tunisia , Gaddafi has secured a mass regional base among a substantial sector of the Libyan population . \nThis support is based on the fact that almost two generations of Libyans have benefited from Gaddafi s petroleum-financed welfare , educational , employment and housing programs , none of which existed under America s favorite , King Idris . \nSince violence is inherent in any armed uprising , once one picks up the gun to seize power , they lose their claim on civil rights . \nIn armed civil conflicts , civil rights are violated on all sides . \nRegardless of the Western media s lurid portrayal of Gaddafi s African mercenary forces and its more muted approval of revolutionary justice against Gaddafi supporters and government soldiers captured in the rebel strongholds , the rules of warfare should have come into play , including the protection of non-combatants-civilians -LRB- including government supporters and officials -RRB- , as well as protection of Libyan prisoners of war in the areas under NATO-rebel control . \nThe unsubstantiated Euro-US claim of genocide amplified by the mass media and parroted by left spokespersons is contradicted by the daily reports of single and double digit deaths and injuries , resulting from urban violence on both sides , as control of cities and towns shifts between the two sides . \nTruth is the first casualty of war , and especially of civil war . \nBoth sides have resorted to monstrous fabrications of victories , casualties , monsters and victims . \nDemons and angels aside , this conflict began as a civil war between two sets of Libyan elites : An established paternalistic , now burgeoning neo-liberal , autocracy with substantial popular backing versus a western imperialist financed and trained elite , backed by an amorphous group of regional , tribal and clerical chiefs , monarchists and neo-liberal professionals devoid of democratic and nationalist credentials and lacking broad-based mass support . \nApril 5 , 2011 at 11:19 am | Reply I swear that if being ignorant was a virtue , the vast majority of people blogging in here would be living saints !!!

\nLibya consists of over 15O tribes , with the two main groups , the Meghabra living in Tripolitania in the west and the Wafallah living in Cyrenaica in the east . \nPrevious attempts to unite these tribes by the Turkish -LRB- 1855-1911 -RRB- and ltalian -LCB- 1911-43 -RRB- colonial rulers failed and the country was split in two for administrative purposes . \nOil was discovered in Libya in 1959 , but King ldris of the Senussi tribe allowed most of the oil profits to be siphoned into the coffers of the oil companies . \nThe coup d'etat on 1 September 1969 led by Colonel Gadaffi had countrywide support . \nHe subsequently married a woman from the royal Barqa tribe and adroitly unified the nation . \nBy retaining Libya 's oil wealth for the benefit of all its people , Gadaffi had created a socialist paradise . \nThere is no unemployment , Libya has the highest GDP in . \nAfrica , less than 5 % of the population is classified as poor and it has fewer people living below the poverty datum line than for example in Holland . \nLife expectancy is 75 years and is the highest in Africa and I0 % above the world average . \nWith the exception of the nomadic Bedouin and Tuareg tribes , most Libyan families possess a house and a car . \nThere is free health care and education and not surprisingly Libya has a literacy rate of 82 % . \nLast year Gadaffi distributed $ 500 to each man , woman and child -LRB- population 6.5 million -RRB- . \nLibya has a tolerable human rights record and stands at 61 on the International Incarceration Index , comparable with countries in central Europe -LRB- the lower the rating , the lower the standing -- the USA occupies the no. 1 spot ! -RRB- . \nThere is hardly any crime and only rebels and traitors are dealt with harshly . \nAnyone who has read Gadaffi 's little Green Book will realize that he is a thoughtful and enlightened leader . \nLibya has been accused of having committed numerous acts of terrorism in the past , but many of these have been perpetrated by foreign intelligence agencies as false flag operations -- the Lockerbie bombing being a prime example . \nThe report represents a severe blow to the attempts by Washington and its NATO allies , backed by the overwhelming majority of the Western media , to dismiss the Libyan government s claims of civilian casualties as propaganda and portray the continuous air raids as a humanitarian defense of the population . \nThe so-called humanitarian air raids have taken the lives of dozens of civilians in various areas of Tripoli , Bishop Giovanni Innocenzo Martinelli , the Apostolic Vicar of Tripoli told Agenzia Fides , the Vatican news service . \nOf particular concern , in the district of Buslim , a building collapsed because of the bombing killing 40 people , he said Yesterday I reported that the bombing had affected some hospitals , albeit indirectly . \nI can now confirm that one of these hospitals is in Misda , a town about 110 miles south of Tripoli . \nThe Euronews television channel reported that a bombing raid on an ammunition dump in Misda had caused damage to the hospital and nearby homes , wounding at least 13 civilians . \nApril 5 , 2011 at 5:30 am | Reply ` Over the past two weeks Libya has been subjected to the most brutal imperial air , sea and land assault in its modern history . \nThousands of bombs and missiles , launched from American and European submarines , warships and fighter planes , are destroying Libyan military bases , airports , roads , ports , oil depots , artillery emplacements , tanks , armored carriers , planes and troop concentrations . \nDozens of CIA and SAS special forces have been training , advising and mapping targets for the so-called Libyan rebels engaged in a civil war against the Gaddafi government , its armed forces , popular militias and civilian supporters -LRB- NY Times 3\\/30\\/11 -RRB- . \nDespite this massive military support and their imperial allies total control of Libya s sky and coastline , the rebels have proven incapable of mobilizing village or town support and are in retreat after being confronted by the Libyan government s highly motivated troops and village militias -LRB- Al Jazeera 3\\/30\\/11 -RRB- . \nOne of the most flimsy excuse for this inglorious rebel retreat offered by the Cameron-Obama-Sarkozy coalition , echoed by the mass media , is that their Libyan clients are outgunned -LRB- Financial Times , 3\\/29\\/11 -RRB- . \nObviously Obama and company don t count the scores of jets , dozens of warships and submarines , the hundreds of daily attacks and the thousands of bombs dropped on the Libyan government since the start of Western imperial intervention . \nDirect military intervention of 20 major and minor foreign military powers , savaging the sovereign Libyan state , as well as scores of political accomplices in the United Nations do not contribute to any military advantage for the imperial clients according to the daily pro-rebel propaganda .

\nA clue is in the selectivity of Western military intervention : In Bahrain , Saudi Arabia , Yemen , Jordan , Qatar and Oman ruling autocrats , allied with and backed by Euro-US imperial states go about arresting , torturing and murdering unarmed urban protestors with total impunity . \nIn Egypt and Tunisia , the US is backing a conservative junta of self-appointed civil-military elites in order to block the profound democratic and nationalist transformation of society demanded by the protesters . \nThe junta aims to push through neo-liberal economic reforms through carefully-vetted pro-Western elected officials . \nWhile liberal critics may accuse the West of hypocrisy and double standards in bombing Gaddafi but not the Gulf butchers , in reality the imperial rulers consistently apply the same standards in each region : They defend strategic autocratic client regimes , which have allowed imperial states to build strategic air force and naval bases , run regional intelligence operations and set up logistical platforms for their ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as their future planned conflict with Iran . \nThey attack Gaddafi s Libya precisely because Gaddafi had refused to actively contribute to Western military operations in Africa and the Middle East . \nThe key point is that while Libya allows the biggest US-European multi-nationals to plunder its oil wealth , it did not become a strategic geo-political-military asset of the empire . \nAs we have written in many previous essays the driving force of US empire-building is military -- and not economic . \nThis is why billions of dollars of Western economic interests and contracts had been sacrificed in the setting up of sanctions against Iraq and Iran with the costly result that the invasion and occupation of Iraq shut down most oil exploitation for over a decade . \nThe Washington-led assault on Libya , with the majority of air sorties and missiles strikes being carried out by the Obama regime , is part of a more general counter-attack in response to the most recent Arab popular pro-democracy movements . \nThe West is backing the suppression of these pro-democracy movements throughout the Gulf ; it finances the pro-imperial , pro-Israel junta in Egypt and it is intervening in Tunisia to ensure that any new regime is correctly aligned . \nIt supports a despotic regime in Algeria as well as Israel s daily assaults on Gaza . \nIn line with this policy , the West backs the uprising of ex-Gaddafites and right-wing monarchists , confident that the liberated Libya will once again provide military bases for the US-European military empire-builders . \nApril 5 , 2011 at 11:20 am | Reply US and NATO are already well known by their aggression and bombing civilian targets . \nThey are the ones who want war to go on and on all over the world , 'cause where is the war there is the money . \nUS did something like this to Serbia because Kosovo in 1998 , and know they are doing it to Libya . \nTime will come when the world will see threw their lies . \nApril 5 , 2011 at 12:17 pm | Reply Let 's just hope that you 're right , General Draza . \nI 'm sick and tired of all the lies the right-wing news media tells us . \nNo wonder we have so many ignorant people blogging in here with their obvious limitations !!!

\nWith full responsibility as witnesses and participants of what is happening , we state that the United States and its allies are thus carrying out genocide against the Libyan people as was the case in Yugoslavia , Afghanistan and Iraq . \nCrimes against humanity , carried out by coalition forces akin to those crimes committed by the fathers and grandfathers of today s Western leaders and their henchmen in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan and in Dresden in Germany , where civilians were also being destroyed in order to deter , to break the will of the people to resist -LRB- Germany remembers it , and therefore refused to participate in this new slaughterhouse -RRB- . \nToday they want in such ways to make the Libyan people surrender their leader and the legitimate government and meekly lay down their national oil wealth for the countries of the coalition . \nWe understand that applying to the international community to save the people of Libya and we were living in Libya , is useless . \nOur only hope is Russia that has the right of veto in the UN , and specifically its leaders the President and the Prime Minister . \nWe still hope for you , as hoped in the past , when we took the decision to stay in Libya , and to help its people , medical duty playing its role in the first place . \nAfter an abortive coup attempt in late February , the situation calmed down in Libya and the government had successfully restored order . \nTo everyone in Libya , it was clear that without American intervention the country would soon return to normal life . \nConvinced that Russia , which has veto power , would not allow the aggression of the United States and its allies , we decided to stay in Libya , but were mistaken : Russia , unfortunately , believed the false assurances of Americans and did not oppose the criminal decision of France and the U.S. US-NATO air strikes on Tripoli and other Libyan cities have claimed growing numbers of civilian victims , according to the Vatican s top representative in the Libyan capital . \nThe report represents a severe blow to the attempts by Washington and its NATO allies , backed by the overwhelming majority of the Western media , to dismiss the Libyan government s claims of civilian casualties as propaganda and portray the continuous air raids as a humanitarian defense of the population . \nThe so-called humanitarian air raids have taken the lives of dozens of civilians in various areas of Tripoli , Bishop Giovanni Innocenzo Martinelli , the Apostolic Vicar of Tripoli told Agenzia Fides , the Vatican news service . \nOf particular concern , in the district of Buslim , a building collapsed because of the bombing killing 40 people , he said Yesterday I reported that the bombing had affected some hospitals , albeit indirectly . \nI can now confirm that one of these hospitals is in Misda , a town about 110 miles south of Tripoli . \nThe Euronews television channel reported that a bombing raid on an ammunition dump in Misda had caused damage to the hospital and nearby homes , wounding at least 13 civilians . \nIn an interview with Euronews , Bishop Martinelli said that the scores of casualties had been confirmed to me by people who have lost loved ones because of these bombings . \nHe cited another incident in which an air strike hit a munitions warehouse located in close proximity to a civilian neighborhood . \nThis building was exploding for three , four hours , he said , claiming more victims . \nIf it is true that the bombings appear to be very targeted , Martrinelli told the Fides news agency , it is also true that they are hitting military targets which are in the midst of civilian neighborhoods , thus the local people are also affected . \nThe bishop added : The situation in Tripoli is becoming more difficult every day . \nThe fuel shortage has worsened , as evidenced by the queues of cars at petrol stations . \nDescribing the military conflict as an impasse , he urged a diplomatic solution to end the bloodshed between Libyans , giving Gaddafi a dignified way out . \nNATO , which formally assumed command of the US-led war against Libya Thursday , said it was investigating the reported casualties . \nLt. Gen. Charles Bouchard , the Canadian officer heading the NATO command in Libya , described the bishop s account as a news report and insisted that NATO was operating under very strict rules of engagement and within the legal mandate of our United Nations mandate . \nEchoing similar statements issued by the NATO command in response to the continuous killing of civilians in Afghanistan , he added , I appreciate the source of this report , but it is worth noting that I take every one of those issues seriously . \nIn a separate incident , the Associated Press interviewed the family of an 18-month-old toddler , Sirajuddin al-Sweisi , who was killed when an ammunition dump near their home in the village of Khorum , about 55 miles south of Tripoli , was attacked by US-NATO warplanes . \nThe young boy s mother said that their house was rocked by the blast at about six in the morning , with debris piercing the wall of the family s home . \nShe found her son , who was sleeping , with a piece of hot metal embedded into the side of his face . \nHis blood was streaming down my arm , she said weeping . \nHe was crying out , Mama , Mama , reaching out with his hand to me . \nThe family rushed him to the hospital where he was treated for burns and broken bones , but he died the same night . \nNeighbors said that the explosions caused by the air raid injured a number of other people and damaged houses in the area . \nWashington and its allies have claimed legitimacy for their imperialist assault on Libya by invoking United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 , which authorizes all necessary measures to protect civilians from attack . \nIt has become increasingly evident that these measures include the slaughter of the very civilians that are supposedly being protected . \nApril 6 , 2011 at 5:08 am | Reply There are a lot of news and info out there If you care to find out . \nFor example : Yes , just show them some truth and they will ban you from this page ! \nI just asked them : Who are you , people , no one here is from Libya , am I right ?

'' \nRebel spokesman Abdul Hafiz Ghoga said opposition fighters had retaken al-Brega after a night of heavy fighting with Moammar Gadhafi 's forces . \nBut it was not immediately clear who commanded control Saturday of the coastal city that has now changed hands six times in as many weeks under the dramatically shifting circumstances of the Libyan war . \nMeanwhile , in Misrata , east of Tripoli , two mortars landed at a medical clinic Saturday evening , causing one death and numerous injuries , said a medical official with the city 's main hospital . \nThe doctor , who was not identified for security reasons , told CNN the clinic that was attacked had evacuated patients because of recent attacks , but was being guarded by opposition `` fighters and young people . '' \nOne person was killed and 15 injured , said the doctor , who was caring for the wounded . \nFive had serious injuries , including head and chest trauma , he said . \nForces loyal to Gadhafi showed no signs of backing down after officials spurned an opposition cease-fire proposal . \nGovernment spokesman Musa Ibrahim told reporters in Tripoli on Friday that rebels were not `` really serious '' about the offer , which he said included `` silly conditions . '' \n`` They are asking us to withdraw from our own cities and open our cities to people , who are holding up arms , who are tribal , violent , no unified leadership , al Qaeda links , and no one knows who they are . \nIf this is not mad , then I do n't know what it is , '' he said . \n`` We will not leave our cities . \nWe will not stop protecting our civilians . '' \nHis comments came after Libyan opposition leader Mustafa Abdul Jalil laid out cease-fire conditions that included freedom of expression for the Libyan people and the removal of snipers , mercenaries and militias from western cities . \nUltimately , he said , the opposition 's goal remains regime change in Libya . \nGhoga sought to clarify the opposition 's position Saturday . \n`` There is no , and was no , negotiation on a cease-fire with Colonel Gaddafi 's dictatorship , '' he said at a Bengahzi news conference . \nHe repeated the opposition demands that Gadhafi halt all military action , end the sieges laid on cities like Misrata and allow free speech and assembly . \nSources close to Gadhafi told CNN that political solutions are still possible but that the Libyan leader would relinquish power only to others within his inner circle . \nThey said there is still time for dialogue but expressed doubts about who would represent the opposition . \nAny transition , they said , would involve Gadhafi 's second son , Saif al-Islam Gadhafi , and for such a transition to take place there would first have to be an end to the fighting . \nThe Libyan sources told CNN that for now , Gadhafi remains confident the regime can withstand any challenge from the rebels . \nU.S. officials claim Gadhafi 's military capabilities have been steadily eroded since the onset of U.N.-sanctioned airstrikes . \nThe dictator 's forces , however , still outnumber rebels by about 10 to 1 in terms of armor and other ground forces , according to Navy Adm. Mike Mullen , the Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman . \nCNN 's Ben Wedeman , Nic Robertson and Reza Sayah contributed to this report \n"}

'' \nForces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi have been fighting to recapture towns from the rebels since an uprising began last month . \nOpposition leaders in Benghazi confirmed to CNN that their forces have left al-Brega , but they are calling their move a `` tactical retreat . '' \nThe military has been pounding the key oil port of Ras Lanuf , once in the hands of rebel forces , and has taken control of towns such as nearby Bin Jawad . \nThe Gadhafi government appears intent on retaking all territory from the opposition despite growing international pressure . \nLibya 's National Oil Corporation , meanwhile , urged companies to resume oil exports after saying that all ports are safe , state TV reported . \nAlso Sunday , the Maryland-based SITE Intelligence Group released a video in which it says Abu Yahya al-Libi , an al Qaeda leader , calls on Libyans to take up arms against Gadhafi . \nThe Libyan leader has frequently accused al Qaeda of being behind the unrest that began last month and has since spiraled into a civil war . \nThe Arab League voted Saturday to back a no-fly zone `` to protect the civilian population '' in Libya , the body 's secretary-general Amre Moussa said . \n`` We will inform the U.N. Security Council of our request to enforce a no-fly zone over Libya , '' Moussa said . \n`` The U.N. Security Council should decide how it will be enforced . '' \nThe Libyan foreign ministry denounced the League 's move , calling it a `` flagrant action against its charter , '' according to state TV Sunday . \nIt also reported that the ministry would welcome the arrival of a fact-finding mission sent by some African nations . \nAlso Saturday , an Al-Jazeera cameraman was killed in an apparent ambush near Benghazi , Libya , becoming the first journalist killed in the country since the start of the civil war , the network reported . \nAli Hassan al Jaber was returning to Benghazi , an opposition stronghold in the east , from a nearby town where he had reported on an opposition protest when `` unknown fighters opened fire on a car he and his colleagues were traveling in , '' Al-Jazeera reported on its English-language website . \nThe cameraman and another person were wounded . \nAl Jaber was rushed to a hospital , but did not survive , the network said . \n`` Al-Jazeera condemns the cowardly crime , which comes as part of the Libyan regime 's malicious campaign targeting Al-Jazeera and its staff , '' the network reported . \nThe no-fly zone which the Arab League is calling for would be a preventive measure and would have to be stopped immediately when the Libyan crisis ends , Youssef bin Alawi bin Abdullah , Oman 's foreign minister said in a joint appearance with Moussa . \nArab League members have reservations about military intervention , but said all countries agreed that a no-fly zone must be imposed urgently to protect civilians , bin Abdullah said . \n`` We hope the Libyan authorities will respect a no-fly decision , '' he said . \n`` Be assured the Arab countries will not accept the intervention of the NATO coalition . '' \nMoussa said the league also voted to open channels of communication with the Transitional National Council , the Libyan opposition 's newly formed administration , and that any talks with that body would be on a humanitarian basis . \n`` We are giving them legitimacy but we 're not giving them political recognition , '' Moussa said . \n`` We are prepared to help evacuate any Arab nationals from Libya regardless of their nationality . '' \nThe Arab League also called for immediate humanitarian assistance and an end to the bloodshed in Libya , where war has broken out between forces loyal to Gadhafi and a tenacious opposition movement . \nThe White House cheered the League 's announcements and stressed it will continue to pressure Gadhafi , support the opposition and prepare for `` all contingencies . '' \nOpposition forces made strides in the early days of the rebellion , but Gadhafi 's military has recently gained strong momentum . \nThe League was meeting at its headquarters in Cairo , while hundreds of demonstrators outside urged the international community to step up support for Libyan opposition groups . \nPleading for international help as they continue to lose ground to pro-Gadhafi forces , rebels are asking for a no-fly zone that would theoretically thwart airstrikes . \nNo-fly zones are areas where aircraft are not allowed to fly . \nSuch zones were put in place after the Gulf War in southern and northern Iraq as a check on the forces of the late Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein . \nWestern powers have said any action by the international community , including a no-fly zone , would have to have regional support and a clear mandate from the United Nations . \nU.S. President Barack Obama said Friday that he `` wo n't take -LRB- the -RRB- decision lightly '' on whether to use military force , including helping to enforce a no-fly zone , saying it is critical to `` balance costs versus benefits . '' \nWhile France has recognized the National Transitional Council as the sole representative of the Libyan people , the European Union was more restrained Friday , saying it `` welcomes and encourages the interim transitional national council based in Benghazi , which it considers a political interlocutor . '' \nThe Libyan government on Saturday took journalists to the eastern city of Bin Jawad , where the government ousted rebels about a week ago . \nCNN 's Nic Robertson said he saw fighter jets in the sky but he did n't see them engage in strikes . \nHe saw some structural damage , such as a blown-out police station and damage to a school and houses , including a Katyusha rocket embedded in the wall of a house . \nSome stores were closed and others had been looted . \nCNN 's Yousuf Basil and Reza Sayah and journalist Mohamed Fadel Fahmy contributed to this report . \n"}

John Larson says Obama did n't properly consult Congress -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Since the U.N. Security Council authorized action Thursday to protect civilians from the effects of Libya 's civil war , a vigorous debate has erupted over the U.S. role in the intervention . \nIn CNN.com 's Opinion section , writers raised questions about the ultimate goal of the military operation and U.S. policy . \nCNN 's Ed Henry describes President Barack Obama 's dilemma here . \nHere are links to the writers ' op-eds and brief excerpts : Regardless of how the intervention plays out , Libya consumed Obama 's attention during a trip intended to boost U.S. economic and security cooperation with key countries in the Western Hemisphere . \nAs he worked to manage an urgent crisis while sustaining focus on an over-the-horizon but nonetheless vital foreign policy objective , Obama was in a predicament familiar to his predecessor . \n... Obama could have canceled his Latin American trip to remain in Washington while the Libyan bombing campaign commenced . \nInstead , braving criticism at home , he embarked on a tour amounting to a long-term investment in America 's geopolitical position . \nThe United States has historically overlooked Latin America . \nClark analyzes U.S. involvement in Libya In theory , the Obama doctrine -- which is clearly attempting to change the storyline of American military intervention in the Arab world -- is a game-changer . \nIn a way , Barack Obama is still behaving as he did as the editor of the Harvard Law Review , hanging back until a center of gravity is established . \nBut in the specific case of Libya , the caution can be confusing : Try as we might , there 's no way to keep American participation in any military action in the back seat , no matter who flies the first planes . \nThere 's no way to ensure that any multilateral coalition works . \nAnd , most important : Is there a way to leave if Gadhafi stays ? \nAnd if we win -LRB- whatever that means -RRB- , who 's left ? \nWho are the Libyan rebels , if they are anything cohesive at all ? \nAnd what if the civil war flares up after we tamp it down ? \nIs that our problem ? \nOr some other country 's problem ? \nClearly , the ambiguity is exactly what Obama was trying to avoid . \nGadhafi is a brutal dictator , an international outlaw , and a sponsor of terrorism with gallons of American and other blood on his hands . \nThus , to the question , is it in America 's vital interests to see Gadhafi go , the answer can only be `` yes . '' \nWhat could very well be worse than taking out Gadhafi now would be a surviving , embittered and emboldened Gadhafi dictator having survived and prevailed over another U.S. attack -- a hero-dictator willing to link up with other terrorist organizations or states set on attacking the United States and the West . \nThe rest of the world is watching how we follow through with Libya . \nLeaving Gadhafi in power , yet again , will send precisely the wrong message to others in his league -- be they terrorist dictators in Iran or elsewhere . \nThere is no question -- Col. Moammar Gadhafi is committing atrocious acts of violence against his own people . \nPresident Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton should be commended for working with the United Nations and our allies to shape a strong international response . \nWith that said , I am very concerned that the president committed America 's military to operations in the region without true consultation with the Congress . \nCall this what they will , we are waging war -- while still engaged on two other fronts -- which will likely require substantial resources over a long period of time . \nAssuming the opposition forces are safe in Benghazi , then what must be done to protect civilians in those towns previously held by the opposition but have now been retaken by Gadhafi 's forces ? \nPresumably some U.N. presence must enter these areas and work to identify and protect civilians . \nThis will likely be resisted by Gadhafi and could spur further conflict . \nWill the U.N. and the coalition be satisfied with a political stalemate on the ground , in which the eastern portion of the country achieves de facto and de jure independence ? \nThe cease-fire called for in the resolution would seem to rule out any renewed offensive activity by the opposition . \nSo unless there is some means to apply additional leverage , there may be two Libyas : one a vengeful dictatorship , the other a fledgling democracy needing long-term international protection . \nThe head-snapping change in policy toward Libya has everyone guessing where the Mideast is heading , whether the U.S. has a good handle , and most of all , what President Obama is trying to achieve ... Will we be caught in increasing contradictions between our policy in Libya -LRB- crack down on an enemy government that kills demonstrators -RRB- vs. Bahrain and Yemen -LRB- go easy on a friendly government that kills demonstrators -RRB- ... The big question mark is the president himself . \nRebounding from his electoral defeats last November , he seemed to be asserting a much firmer grasp on power , but in recent weeks , he appears to outsiders as someone who has slipped back into a haze of caution . \nThe Economist this week is even questioning his political courage . \nAs he sends U.S. troops into harm 's way , many in Washington are now waiting to see which Obama now emerges . \nMuch rides on the outcome . \nThe military intervention that President Obama authorized against Libya on Saturday -- eight years to the day after President George W. Bush announced the commencement of `` Operation Iraqi Freedom '' -- is a quite different operation from the 2003 invasion of Iraq . \nBeyond the obvious difference that Obama has not authorized the use of U.S. ground forces in Libya , there are other differences to consider : First , the Obama administration was handed a gift by the Arab League , which in its more than six-decade history has garnered a well-earned reputation as a feckless talking shop , but unusually took a stand one week ago by endorsing a no-fly zone over Libya . \nThe unexpected action by the Arab League gave the administration the impetus and diplomatic cover to then go to the United Nations Security Council to secure a broad resolution endorsing not only a no-fly zone , but also allowing member states to `` take all necessary measures '' to protect civilians in Libya . \nThis is in contrast to George W. Bush 's ineffectual attempts to gather international support for the invasion of Iraq in 2003 . \nThere was no U.N. resolution explicitly authorizing the use of military force against Hussein , and no Muslim countries participated in the American invasion and occupation of Iraq . \nThe opinions expressed in these commentaries are solely those of the authors . \n"}

\nROB FURNISS , BRITISH CANINE SEARCH SPECIALIST : Very . \nThere 's a lot of technical gear . \nObviously , the listening devices , the cameras . \nThere 's all that stuff , all that stuff for locating people . \nBut at the end of the day , you ca n't beat a dog for hitting the scent of a human being . \nTODD : Like most canine specialists , Rob Furnace has a tight bond with his Border Collie Byron . \nTODD : The dogs are so highly trained , they 're able to block out the scent of a deceased person and pick up only on someone who 's alive . \nTheir success rate is impressive . \nThese teams pulled more than a dozen survivors safely from the rubble in Haiti , in no small part due to teammates like this German shepherd named Wracker . \nBut keeping them sharp involves some creativity . \nThe team just had to do a drill with Wracker because they have n't found anyone alive in a few days . \nThey 've just had one of their own team members hide in this place , out of sight , just out of any sensory perception for Wracker . \nSent Wracker in there to see if they could find that team member . \nThat 's how they keep the dogs sharp if they have n't found anyone in a few days . \nYou stare in amazement as they run full speed , jump , land and bounce off objects that are so jagged and uneven that most people could n't even attempt it . \nBut they 're not invincible . \nDid he give you any kind of a signal or did you just see the blood ? \nTODD : Tomo , a German shepherd , snagged something in his paw . \nA little field surgery and he 's back in the game . \nLater on , Wracker needs more work to stitch up a wound . \nNever during either incident do we hear one whimper from either dog . \nTODD : Traveling , sleeping , eating and playing with their handlers is part of the routine . \nTheir communication is so instinctive that they sometimes understand each other just by making eye contact . \nWe did n't witness them finding survivors in Japan , but the dogs serve another purpose for those who 've lost everything . \nELIZABETH KREITLER , FAIRFAX CANINE SEARCH SPECIALIST : Having the dog and seeing the times that the people in Haiti or something would enjoy a little solace from the dog , that 's also part of their job and helpful to everybody , to teammates and myself alike . \nTODD : All of these dogs actually live with their handlers , who are heavily involved in their training . \nThat helps solidify the bond between them and helps them get through these long deployments a long way from home . \nBrian Todd , CNN , Unosumai , Japan . \nTOMEKA JONES , CNN STUDENT NEWS : Today 's Shoutout goes out to Mrs. Golebiewski 's social studies classes at Northridge Middle School in Middlebury , Indiana ! \nThe word `` vernal '' refers to what season ? \nYou know what to do ! \nIs it : A -RRB- Winter , B -RRB- Spring , C -RRB- Summer or D -RRB- Fall ? \nYou 've got three seconds -- GO ! \nVernal comes from the Latin word for spring . \nThat 's your answer and that 's your Shoutout ! \nAZUZ : The vernal equinox occurs when day and night are equal lengths , and this happened Sunday night . \nThat event marks the official start of spring . \nBut depending on where you live , it does not mean you should start packing up your snow gear just yet . \nA winter storm brought snow and rain to California on Monday , leaving thousands of homes without power and closed some schools and roads . \nEvery road into California 's Yosemite National Park was closed after storms dumped three-and-a-half feet of snow throughout the park . \nAnd in New Jersey , on the East Coast , some people spent the first full day of spring clearing sidewalks instead of hitting golf balls . \nAZUZ : As you might expect , the weather 's a little warmer down in Miami , Florida . \nOfficials there are hoping some new outdoor facilities will let Floridians do more than just have fun in the sun . \nThey want people to work out -- outside ! \nMen 's Health Magazine recently named Miami as America 's fattest city . \nNow , that is a reputation that city officials want to shed , so they 're installing these outdoor gyms in order to encourage people to get out and get in shape . \nIf you ca n't afford a memership ? \nThese outdoor facilities are totally free . \nAnd as you can see , some fitness fanatics are already putting them to good use . \nAZUZ : But what we 're curious about is this : Do you think it 'll work ? \nSome of the people in that video , you could tell it was n't their first time at a gym . \nBut do you think these outdoor facilities would encourage folks who would n't normally work out to hit the equipment if it 's outside ? \nHead to our blog at CNNStudentNews.com and weigh in with your thoughts . \nAZUZ : An undefeated senior season . \nAnthony Robles is definitely an impressive athlete . \nHe 's also an inspiration . \nRobles was born without a right leg . \nHe 's never let that hold him back . \nHe adapted his wrestling style , building the strength and size of his upper body into more than other wrestlers in his weight class . \nThat style helped him win a national title recently . \nRobles says everyone faces some kind of adversity . \nThe key is to stay focused . \nANTHONY ROBLES , NCAA WRESTLING CHAMPION : Everybody has their own obstacles in their life , whether it be physical , mental , the outside world . \nWhatever it is , everybody experiences their own obstacles , and it 's about just looking beyond that , and really just focusing on your goals and going after them . \nAZUZ : Good insight . \nBefore we go today , there 's a shuttle mission we 're talking to you about that 's never going to get off the ground . \nBut it 's not supposed to . \nAbout 2,000 employees at NASA 's Kennedy Space Center got together to form this human shuttle in the parking lot . \nIt 's a tribute to the space program , which is going away . \nProbably cost a lot less than an actual shuttle . \nIt took about an hour . \nWe sped the thing up so you could see how it all came together . \nIt 's impressive that they found a spot to pull this off . \nAZUZ : But if there 's anything NASA 's good at , it 's finding space . \nWe hope that you 'll find space for CNN Student News tomorrow , when we return . \nWe will look forward to launching into more commercial-free headlines then . \n"}

Security Council authorized action Thursday to protect civilians from the effects of Libya 's civil war , a vigorous debate has erupted over the U.S. role in the intervention . \nIn CNN.com 's Opinion section , writers raised questions about the ultimate goal of the military operation and U.S. policy . \nCNN 's Ed Henry describes President Barack Obama 's dilemma here . \nHere are links to the writers ' op-eds and brief excerpts : Daniel Kliman : Obama 's geopolitical juggling act Regardless of how the intervention plays out , Libya consumed Obama 's attention during a trip intended to boost U.S. economic and security cooperation with key countries in the Western Hemisphere . \nAs he worked to manage an urgent crisis while sustaining focus on an over-the-horizon but nonetheless vital foreign policy objective , Obama was in a predicament familiar to his predecessor . \n... Obama could have canceled his Latin American trip to remain in Washington while the Libyan bombing campaign commenced . \nInstead , braving criticism at home , he embarked on a tour amounting to a long-term investment in America 's geopolitical position . \nThe United States has historically overlooked Latin America . \nYet today , the region constitutes a market nearly as large as China 's , boasts an influential rising power in Brazil and hosts dangerous criminal insurgencies that respect no borders . \nWhatever U.S. interests exist in Libya -- there is room for reasonable debate -- the country does not outweigh the rest of the Western Hemisphere . \nGloria Borger : Obama and Libya : Tell us how this ends In theory , the Obama doctrine -- which is clearly attempting to change the storyline of American military intervention in the Arab world -- is a game-changer . \nIn a way , Barack Obama is still behaving as he did as the editor of the Harvard Law Review , hanging back until a center of gravity is established . \nBut in the specific case of Libya , the caution can be confusing : Try as we might , there 's no way to keep American participation in any military action in the back seat , no matter who flies the first planes . \nThere 's no way to ensure that any multilateral coalition works . \nAnd , most important : Is there a way to leave if Gadhafi stays ? \nAnd if we win -LRB- whatever that means -RRB- , who 's left ? \nWho are the Libyan rebels , if they are anything cohesive at all ? \nAnd what if the civil war flares up after we tamp it down ? \nIs that our problem ? \nOr some other country 's problem ? \nClearly , the ambiguity is exactly what Obama was trying to avoid . \n"}
{"id": "228", "time": "2011-03-22", "text": "By Gloria Borger , CNN Senior Political Analyst Gloria Borger : On one level , it made sense for France , Britain to take the lead She says Obama was seeking to de-emphasize U.S. role in Libya mission President has said Gadhafi must go , but U.N. resolution did n't call for regime change She says Obama has been vague on what the exit strategy is for the military intervention Editor 's note : Gloria Borger is a senior political analyst for CNN , appearing regularly on CNN 's `` The Situation Room , '' `` AC360 , '' `` John King , USA '' and `` State of the Union . '' \nWashington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The story of the Libyan intervention may pain some of the most ardent believers in the proposition that it is America 's role to take the lead , all of the time , everywhere . \nBut when the French and the British began the first sorties into Libyan airspace , it made an awful lot of sense : It 's their neighborhood after all . \nAnd when the Arab League decided to support some kind of allied intervention , it seemed a powerful consensus was developing . \nThen came the United Nations resolution , and the deal was sealed . \nSome complained that President Barack Obama had dithered and that it was too late for an effective no-fly zone . \nOthers applauded his insistence on not going it alone . \nPut me in that camp : Without a strategic reason for unilateral U.S. military action , this is clearly a humanitarian effort . \nAnd a worldwide one . \nSo if the president has done the right thing , why does it feel as if something is wrong ? \nIt 's hard to pinpoint exactly , but there 's an amorphous and unsettling nature to this action . \nOn the one hand , there is one coalition goal that has been explicitly stated and affirmed : This is an effort to keep Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi from murdering his own people . \nYet there 's another goal here -- an implicit one -- that suddenly no one can explain in any great detail : Gadhafi has to go . \nIt 's something the president himself said two weeks ago . \nAnd on Monday , he labored to separate his own words -LRB- as in , the end of the Gadhafi regime is `` U.S. policy '' -RRB- from the wording of the U.N. resolution -LRB- the humanitarian protection of the Libyan people -RRB- . \nIn other words : We know the ouster of Gadhafi is part of the preferred endgame . \nBut we ca n't make it part of the official coalition plan because regime change is nowhere in it . \nWhat are U.S. expectations for Libya ? \nHow Americans feel about Libya The president has stated the obvious : The military operation is there to prevent a bloodbath . \nBut we know that the military , political and financial pressure is also there to remove Gadhafi . \nSo we understand the ultimate goal , but the coalition ca n't spell it out . \nNor can we do it , exactly -- at least not as a stated goal . \n-LRB- And the generals were out in force over the weekend explaining that indeed , Gadhafi could potentially remain in power . -RRB- \nSo we 're left with the prospect that once the rebels are no longer in danger of being overwhelmed by Gadhafi 's forces , we will then proceed to the `` tightening the noose '' phase of the operation that will finally lead to Gadhafi 's departure . \nAnd then there 's this : How do we know when we have succeeded ? \nHow can we judge a humanitarian crisis averted ? \nSure , we can tell when the danger to innocent civilians has abated -LRB- because we have destroyed or dismantled Gadhafi 's air capability -RRB- . \nBut if the core of that danger is a murderous thug who still reigns , can you only abate it by removing him ? \nThat 's where the strategy gets a tad circular : How can you ensure the end of the killing unless you get rid of the hideous man ordering it ? \nRichard Haass , the president of the Council on Foreign Relations and who is no fan of this intervention , tells me that America 's problem is an administration that is focused more on process than policy . \n`` This was based too much on getting support and not enough on a sustainable plan , '' he says . \n`` I do n't think we thought it through . \nSimply getting a coalition does n't mean it 's a good idea . \nGetting the Arab League does n't make it a good idea . \nMultilateralism does n't make the end better . '' \nIn fact , it probably makes the intervention even more difficult to manage . \nIn theory , the Obama doctrine -- which is clearly attempting to change the storyline of American military intervention in the Arab world -- is a game-changer . \nIn a way , Barack Obama is still behaving as he did as the editor of the Harvard Law Review , hanging back until a center of gravity is established . \nBut in the specific case of Libya , the caution can be confusing : Try as we might , there 's no way to keep American participation in any military action in the backseat , no matter who flies the first planes . \nThere 's no way to ensure that any multilateral coalition works . \nAnd , most important : Is there a way to leave if Gadhafi stays ? \nAnd if we win -LRB- whatever that means -RRB- , who 's left ? \nWho are the Libyan rebels , if they are anything cohesive at all ? \nAnd what if the civil war flares up after we tamp it down ? \nIs that our problem ? \nOr some other country 's problem ? \nClearly , the ambiguity is exactly what Obama was trying to avoid . \nOr if he does , he has n't told us about it . \nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gloria Borger . \n"}

\nIs Libya more divided than Egypt seemed to be ? \nBecause those supporters seem awfully passionate in those videos , like they 'd continue the fight ...

The Lies , Fascism , Hypocrisy is the root of the problems in the Middle East not the Judaism , Christianity or Islam . \nThe Al-quida is a creation of the West and the media spin . \nWho ever monitory gains from this conflict are the culprits . \nNow do we go attack Iran because Israel wants us to ????? Does any one think about our service men an women who are made to fight these wars from our tax dollars ? \nWhy do any interviews at all on the Lybian conflict , what the coalition should do is drop leaf-lets to all opposition fighters telling them to spread the word to get clear of any cities where pro-Gadaffi fighters or supporters may be and once their all clear , `` JUST LEVEL THE ENTIRE COUNTRY WITH THOUSANDS OF DAISEY-CUTTERS '' ...

'' \nCNN was not able to reach anyone from NATO or the Transitional National Council , based out of the opposition-held eastern Libyan city of Benghazi , to confirm reports of the Brega attack . \nThe government spokesman , Musa Ibrahim , also issued a warning that he said he hoped would make headlines around the world . \n`` We will die for oil . \nWe will kill for oil , '' Ibrahim said . \n`` We will kill everyone who comes near our oil . \nRebels , NATO , we do n't care . \nWe will defend our oil to the last drop of blood that we have . '' \nHis comments came shortly after Gadhafi used similar imagery in pledging not to knuckle under to international demands that he cede the power he has held tightly for nearly 42 years , and instead said he would remain `` until the last drop of my blood . '' \n`` It is impossible for me to leave my loyal people , '' he told an enthusiastic crowd numbering in the thousands in the western city of Ageelat , in a speech that was broadcast over state television . \n`` I will remain with my people and with my firearm until the last drop of my blood . \nWe will win over this unjust campaign . \nWe will win over the campaign of colonization , the campaign of hatred . '' \nAfter Gadhafi spoke , dozens of young men dressed in civilian clothes and carrying shiny new Kalashnikov rifles in a crowded square fired their weapons into the air in celebration . \nOne of the participants in the pro-government demonstration said he had a message for Libyan rebels who have been fighting Gadhafi 's forces on three fronts : `` I would tell our brothers in Misrata and Benghazi , stop the bloodshed , '' said Walid Khaila , a 22-year old medical student . \nLibya has been riven by a civil war since shortly after peaceful anti-government protests in February were met by violent crackdowns by government forces . \nThat prompted NATO forces in March to launch a campaign of airstrikes against government troops and command-and-control centers , as well as the Libyan leader 's compound in Tripoli . \nGadhafi said he would welcome warm relations with Europeans , who compose many of the NATO forces . \n`` We want a strong relationship , cooperation and peace with the European people , and not with the war criminals , who must leave immediately , '' he said . \nHe added , though , that he and his followers are prepared to endure privation to ensure he remains the leader of Libya . \n`` We are ready to live without electricity , without benzene , without buildings , and without air conditioning , '' he said . \n`` But our firearms are in our hands to fight until the end . '' \nTheir statements came on the same day that Libya 's prime minister warned Western governments they were looking at their last opportunity to engage in oil deals with Tripoli . \n`` Now is the last chance for any nation contributing to the aggression to review their policy , '' Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi said after meeting with top Libyan oil industry executives . \nHe said any future oil deals with Italy and its energy giant ENI were already off the table . \nRome and Tripoli were close trading partners until the conflict erupted in Libya last winter . \nTripoli has said that ENI alone invested tens of billions of dollars in Libya 's oil and natural gas industry . \nItaly scrapped a friendship treaty with Libya last February , in the wake of Colonel Moammar Gadhafi 's bloody crackdown on peaceful opposition demonstrators . \nLater , Italy joined the NATO bombing campaign of Gadhafi 's forces , after the United Nations Security Council passed two resolutions authorizing the use of force to protect Libyan civilians . \nAlso Thursday , the United Nations reported it completed a four-day humanitarian assessment mission to the port city of Misrata , site of intense fighting in recent months . \nThough aspects of normalcy have returned to the city , it remains surrounded by government forces and exposed to intermittent rocket attacks , the world body said in a release . \nMisrata is 210 kilometers -LRB- 130 miles -RRB- east of Tripoli on the Mediterranean and , because of the government forces around it , can be reached only by sea . \nThough some shops and markets have reopened , rising food prices , a shortage of supplies and a lack of cash mean that most residents have been short of food . \nThe World Food Programme said that , since April , it has distributed 2,634 metric tons of food in Misrata to 125,000 people . \n"}

'' \nMoments later , the `` Doomsday Plane , '' his link to the Pentagon and the White House from wherever he is in the world , rolled down the tarmac and climbed into a sunny sky . \nThe 67-year-old secretary is on his way out of government after serving eight presidents , but he has n't announced a departure date yet other than saying it will be this year . \nAnd these regular trips are intensive , long days for the former career intelligence professional -- walking the beat , embracing allies , bolstering morale and getting his own fix on the troubles of the day . \nGates ended his latest overseas jaunt -- a six-day trip to Russia and the Middle East -- by traveling by helicopter from Amman Airport to Jordan 's Royal Palace for a private , no-cameras-allowed meeting with King Abdullah . \nHe said privately , according to aides , what he had been saying publicly on the trip -- that the upheaval across the Middle East was serving up challenges and opportunities , and the key was to sort them out . \nOvershadowing his stops in Russia , Egypt and Israel was the U.S. and coalition military operation over Libya . \nHe delayed his planned departure on this trip for a day at the start of the air attacks . \nGen. Ham : We will not arm Libyan rebels Libya 's civil war making families homeless Will coalition forces target Gadhafi ? \nWhile in Russia , he found himself in the middle of a political dispute over the Libyan mission . \nAides informed him when a U.S. fighter jet and two aviators went down and were rescued near Benghazi . \nHe was briefed on every development as the U.S. Air Force and Navy led the airstrikes . \nAnd while many on his plane dozed or ate their meatloaf and mashed potatoes on the flight back to Washington on Friday , Gates was linked to the White House and a National Security Council conference call for the latest deliberations on the military , diplomatic and political calculus of enforcing the Libyan mission . \nGates will make appearances on the Sunday talk show circuit and visit Capitol Hill in the coming days to offer public and private explanations of how the U.S. military performed . \nAnd perhaps he also will speak about his view of the future . \nBut on the trip , in public statements , and in talking to traveling and local journalists , he was careful and diplomatic . \nHe dispensed with each question about `` the endgame '' of the Libyan missions by saying the goals are clear : creation and enforcement of the no-fly zone and protection of Libyan civilians . \nAbout targeting Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi , about working in concert with Libyan rebels , about the risk of a military stalemate , Gates would n't bite , saying the future there is for the Libyans themselves to decide . \nGates told America 's Middle East allies that Washington stands by them . \nIn Cairo , he repeated his praise for the Egyptian military for keeping that country from going over the brink in the mass protests that toppled President Hosni Mubarak just last month . \nHe arrived in Israel just after a bus stop bombing in Jerusalem and continuing rocket attacks in the south . \nGates repeated the standard line that the U.S. commitment was unshakeable and used the code words for continued aid , saying that the United States would ensure Israel 's qualitative military edge . \nOn his last day , he moved briskly from photo-op to meetings . \nThe first stop was the old Roman town of Caesarea , a luxury hotel where guests gawked at the motorcade and the heavily armed , plain-clothes Israeli agents standing watch . \nInside , Gates met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who promised that the recent terrorism would be answered with what he called `` great force and great determination to put a stop to it . '' \nAnd there was also mention of the elusive goal of a peace agreement , with Netanyahu adding , `` we seek to establish security for the establishment of peace . '' \nGates offered his condolences to the families of the victims of the terror attack and those enduring the rocket attacks in southern Israel . \nNext stop for Gates , after a wild convoy ride through Israeli traffic , was the West Bank , and a reminder of how many administrations have tried and failed to nudge the sides toward Mideast peace . \nNow in an armored SUV , he crossed over to newly constructed Palestinian Authority offices in Ramallah . \nIn the diplomatic game , where symbols can substitute for substance , Gates acknowledged that his presence alone made history . \n`` I understand I 'm the first American secretary of defense to visit Ramallah , '' Gates told the Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Salam Fayyad . \nAt the end of his remarks before the assembled media , before a 50-minute closed-door meeting , Gates added that he looked forward to discussing the central -- but elusive -- element of U.S. peace proposals for Israel and the Palestinians , a two-state solution . \nLater , in Ramallah , crowds of people leaving a mosque at the end of Friday prayers watched the Gates convoy glide past , as the secretary raced on to his next meeting and on to Washington . \n"}

'' \nHresha , who taught physics at Tripoli University , later fled to Canada . \nA central , open question about Libya The prominent member of the Muslim Brotherhood now lives in London , and anticipates the group could become an important player in a post-Gadhafi environment . \nAs in Egypt and Tunisia , the Brotherhood in Libya has been energized by the sudden upheaval sweeping the Arab world . \nIt says it has no organizational links with the Brotherhood elsewhere , but shares the philosophy of the pan-Arab Islamist movement founded in Egypt in the 1920s . \nLargely drawn from the devout educated middle classes and university campuses in Tripoli and Benghazi , the Libyan Muslim Brotherhood was founded in the mid-1950s . \nIslamist opposition to the Libyan regime gathered force in the late 1980s , as part of a wider Islamic awakening or `` Sahwa '' in the region and in reaction to what many saw as an attempt by Gadhafi to hijack and interpret Islam for his own purposes . \nWhile jihadists launched a brief but unsuccessful campaign to overthrow Gadhafi in the 1990s , the Brotherhood focused much of its efforts on clandestine preaching and social welfare efforts in Libya .0 In 1998 , Gadhafi 's security services launched a crackdown against the group that saw more than 200 members imprisoned and hundreds more forced into exile , including Hresha . \nDespite years of repression , Hresha claims the Brotherhood still has thousands of members scattered across Libya , with chapters in almost every single town , including Sirte , Gadhafi 's birthplace on the coast west of Tripoli . \nIn 2006 , its leaders were released after reconciling with the Libyan regime . \nBut now the Brotherhood is siding with the rebellion . \nIn February , as protests in Libya began , Yusuf al Qaradawi -- an Egyptian preacher in Qatar widely viewed as the Muslim Brotherhood 's chief spiritual guide -- issued a fatwa or religious ruling obliging any Libyan soldier who had the opportunity to do so to assassinate the leader . \nFighting on Libya 's front lines Should coalition support Libyan rebels ? \nAl-Amin Bilhaj , a leading figure in the Libyan Muslim Brotherhood and the President of the Muslim Association of Britain -LRB- MAB -RRB- recently traveled to Benghazi , the headquarters of the rebel movement , according to Hresha . \nOther Brotherhood exiles have returned to help treat the wounded in hospitals , according to Kemal el Helbawy , the Egyptian founder of the British association . \nThere is little or no overt presence of the Brotherhood in Benghazi , according to CNN 's Arwa Damon , who has been there for most of the month . \nBut in the longer term , in a country where the political space has been dominated by Gadhafi for more than 40 years , the Brotherhood 's organization and nationwide presence may afford it an advantage . \nThe West has nothing to fear from the Muslim Brotherhood in Libya , according to Hresha . \nLike their counterparts in Egypt , they would embrace multiparty democracy . \n`` I 've lived for many years in Canada and the UK , and that 's exactly the political system that we want , '' Hresha said . \nHresha says that if his organization forms a political party , it would seek to legislate according to Koranic principles , which would include , for example , a continued ban on the sale of alcohol . \n`` Why should n't we be able to press our point of view -- we are humans too , '' he said . \nHresha said the Libyan Muslim Brotherhood welcomes airstrikes in Libya , a startling turnaround for a movement that previously supported jihad by Iraqis against U.S. forces occupying Iraq . \n`` I salute and am very grateful to the Americans , French and British governments for stopping the killing , '' he said . \n`` I will never forget this . '' \nHresha said he hopes a post-Gadhafi Libya will be a close friend to the West . \nA more prominent role for the Brotherhood in Libya could dent support for al Qaeda and other jihadist groups , especially in eastern provinces that have witnessed significant radicalization in recent years . \nBut Libya 's deeply tribal structures -- unlike Egypt and Tunisia -- may complicate its efforts to build a national base . \nAnd hardline `` Salafi '' preachers have gained influence in neglected towns like Derna -- on the coast near the border with Egypt . \n`` Conservative imams -LRB- in Derna -RRB- , '' a U.S. diplomat wrote in 2008 , `` deliberately sought to eliminate the few social activities on offer for young people to monopolize the social and cultural environment . '' \nBut in the end , the reach of the Brotherhood may be most limited by the emergence of secular forces at the forefront of the rebel movement . \nThe Interim National Council in Benghazi -- a 30-member opposition leadership -- is mostly made up of lawyers , doctors , intellectuals and former political prisoners with a secular bent . \nIn a statement Monday , the Council stated the ultimate goal of the revolution was `` to build a constitutional democratic civil state based on the rule of law , respect for human rights and the guarantee of equal rights and opportunities for all its citizens including ... equal opportunities between men and women and the promotion of women empowerment . '' \nGuma el-Gamaty , a Libyan academic based in the UK who has emerged as a key liaison between the Libyan opposition overseas and the Benghazi Council said no Muslim Brotherhood leaders had yet been appointed to the Council , and played down their influence . \nHresha , the long-time Brotherhood member , expects that to change . \n`` We 've been working secretly till this moment , '' he said . \n"}
{"id": "237", "time": "2011-03-25", "text": "By the CNN Wire Staff All 28 NATO allies authorized a plan that includes civilian protection Transition to be complete by Sunday night , sources say Questions on rules of engagement remain to be worked out Brussels , Belgium -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- NATO members agreed Thursday to take over enforcement of the no-fly zone over Libya , but stopped short of interpreting that mandate as a license to attack government troops who may be threatening unarmed civilians . \n`` What we have decided today is that NATO will enforce the no-fly zone , '' NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen told CNN 's Wolf Blitzer from the organization 's headquarters in Brussels . \nUnder Thursday 's agreement , NATO forces will be able to close air space to all flights except for humanitarian ones and will be able to use force in self-defense . \nNATO also has sent a directive to its military chain of command asking for a plan on how to execute an expanded role for enforcement of U.N. Resolution 1973 , according to NATO sources . \nUnder what some officials were calling `` no-fly plus , '' NATO would be given more robust rules of engagement to ensure that civilians are protected , the sources said . \nAnd , in an effort to ease concerns from Turkey -- the organization 's sole Muslim country -- coalition forces would be allowed to withdraw from certain missions , such as those involving attacking Libyan soldiers , the sources said . \nmedia trip goes wrong Gadhafi tanks turned into wreckage What does Libya 's military have left ? \nShould coalition support Libyan rebels ? \nAs for the prospect of a more robust mandate , one that the U.S.-led coalition has followed so far , `` That decision has not been made yet , '' Rasmussen said . \nHe added that NATO will have outside help in whatever mission it opts to pursue . \n`` It 's of utmost importance to stress that this is not primarily a NATO operation , '' he said . \n`` It is a broad international effort in which we will include partners from the region that have pledged to contribute to this protection of civilians in Libya . '' \nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton , who will travel to London to attend an international meeting on Libya on Tuesday , gave an upbeat assessment of what the coalition has accomplished in five days . \n`` We have made significant progress , '' she told reporters . \n`` A massacre in Benghazi was prevented . \nGadhafi 's air force and air defenses have been rendered largely ineffective , and the coalition is in control of the skies above Libya . '' \nShe welcomed the fact that the coalition includes aircraft and pilots from Qatar and Thursday 's announcement by the United Arab Emirates that it , too , would send planes to protect Libya 's civilians . \n`` In the days ahead , as NATO assumes command-and-control responsibilities , the welfare of those civilians will be of paramount concern , '' she said . \n`` This operation has already saved many lives , but the danger is far from over . '' \nRasmussen said the issue did not represent a split in NATO over the mission . \nHowever , he also acknowledged that , if unaltered , the agreement would mean the overall mission would have two parts , with NATO enforcing the no-fly zone and the U.S.-led coalition handling a naval blockade and airstrikes . \nThursday 's deal was reached after a conference call among Clinton and her counterparts from Britain , France and Turkey , according to diplomatic officials who spoke on condition of not being identified by name . \nSo far , U.S. forces have shouldered the bulk of the mission , according to figures provided by the Pentagon . \nOf the 175 Tomahawk missiles fired , 168 were from the United States and seven from Great Britain , the only two countries to possess them , while U.S. planes have flown almost two-thirds of the sorties and U.S. ships comprise more than two-thirds of the total involved . \nThe flurry of diplomatic activity came as the battle for control of Libya was continuing to unfold . \nAfter a fifth consecutive night of pounding by coalition jets , Libyans gathered at a seaside cemetery in Tripoli on Thursday for the funerals of 33 people Gadhafi 's government said were victims of an airstrike . \nState television said the dead were victims of the `` crusader colonial aggression . '' \nEarlier , a Libyan government official said coalition planes struck the suburb of Tajura and state TV showed images of fires , smoldering vehicles and the charred bodies of the dead . \nAt the cemetery , anger trumped grief and Gadhafi 's message was loud and clear : innocent people were wrongly killed and the Libyan people will fight back . \nCNN could not independently verify the circumstances of the deaths or who the victims were . \nIn Tripoli , CNN reporters go on government-organized tours in an effort to do their own reporting ; Libyan authorities forbid independent movement by international journalists in Tripoli . \nFighting on Libya 's front lines White House answers Libya questions What could be the end game in Libya ? \nMilitary leaders talk U.S. role in Libya The reports of civilian deaths were given little credence by coalition forces , which launched airstrikes Thursday near Tripoli , Misrata and Ajdabiya in Libya . \n`` The only civilian casualties we know are for certain are the ones that the Libyan government itself has caused , '' U.S. Navy Vice Adm. Bill Gortney said . \nAt the United Nations , Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he has seen no signs of a cease-fire by Libyan government authorities , as called for by U.N. Resolution 1973 , which was hurriedly passed last Thursday as Libyan forces were closing in on the rebel stronghold of Benghazi . \nBan told council members , `` to the contrary , fierce battles continue in and around the cities of '' Ajdabiya , Misrata and Zinan . \nHe added that his envoy told Libyan authorities that if the government did not comply with the cease-fire resolution , `` the Security Council was prepared to take additional measures . '' \nBan said he had sent his envoy to an African Union meeting to be held Friday in Addis Ababa , Ethiopia , at which representatives of the Gadhafi government and the opposition were expected to attend . \n`` Their aim : to reach a cease-fire and political solution . '' \nBut there was no sign that any such solution was near . \nThe battle for Misrata , Libya 's third-largest city , has been ongoing for more than a week . \nBritish Foreign Secretary William Hague said Thursday that many residents remain trapped in their homes without electricity and communications and with a dwindling supply of food and water . \nIn the east , Gadhafi 's tanks were shelling Ajdabiya , where fighting had occurred the day before . \nLoyalist forces still controlled the northern and western gates to the city . \n`` This underlines the appalling danger its inhabitants would be in without coalition action , as do continued threats by Gadhafi forces to ` massacre ' residents in areas under bombardment , '' Hague said . \nThe coalition has established a no-fly zone that spans from east to west along Libya 's coast . \nFrench jets fired air-to-ground missiles on a Libyan combat aircraft Thursday that was in violation of the no-fly mandate , destroying it , the French Defense Ministry said . \nThe plane was struck as it was landing in a Misrata airfield . \nThe civil war was sparked in February by protests demanding an end to Gadhafi 's nearly 42-year rule . \nThe Libyan strongman responded with force against civilians , prompting the international community to take action beginning last weekend . \nThough the rebels ' position may have improved since then , a U.S. official said Gadhafi 's forces still have the upper hand . \nThey remain capable of carrying out attacks on the opposition , are relatively well-organized and continue to fight effectively , the official said . \nCNN 's Nic Robertson , Arwa Damon , Elise Labott , Paula Newton and Jim Bittermann contributed to this report . \n"}

Carter Ham , commander of U.S. Africa Command , also said on CNN 's `` The Situation Room '' Friday that removing leader Moammar Gadhafi by military means is not the aim of the mission and that the coalition is not arming rebel forces . \nAnd the general claimed `` we have achieved already a large degree of success '' -- including an arms embargo , the no-fly zone and the halting of loyalist troops near the rebel-held city of Benghazi . \nPresident Barack Obama will update the nation at 7:30 p.m. ET Monday from the National Defense University at Fort McNair in Washington , D.C. , the White House announced . \nNATO this weekend is expected to take over control of the no-fly zone from the United States and finalize procedures on protecting civilians . \nBut Ham acknowledged that challenges remain . \nNATO prepares to take over Libya mission Bullets fired into Libyan maternity ward `` We find these regime forces taking cover inside built-up areas where they know -- because of our concern for civilian casualties -- that we wo n't strike in there , '' he told CNN 'S Wolf Blitzer . \nLoyalist snipers , along with armored units , continue to be a threat . \n`` It is a tough , tough challenge for us , '' said Ham , speaking from Stuttgart , Germany . \n`` When we see regime forces attacking civilians , we will do everything we can to stop those attacks . '' \nNot long after allies unleashed cruise missiles against Gadhafi air defenses last Saturday , Obama told Americans he wanted the United States , which has headed the military campaign , to hand over control of the enforcement of a U.N. Security Council resolution . \nThe resolution called for the protection of Libyan civilians and the enforcement of the no-fly zone . \nNATO , which includes the United States , will lead both efforts . \nThe United States has been treating the protection of civilians as part of the mission , and that activity will continue regardless of the command structure , Navy Vice Adm. Bill Gortney said . \n`` Job one is to protect the Libyan people and the job does n't change because we have a new boss , '' he said , briefing reporters at the Pentagon . \nFighting on Libya 's front lines Obama on Friday conducted a conference call and meeting with congressional leaders to provide an update on the conflict and attempt to address their concerns about the mission 's organization , cost and consequences . \nDemocrats appeared more satisfied than Republicans . \nMeanwhile , coalition fighter planes in a 24-hour period took out seven Libyan tanks it claims were threatening civilian populations , including in the city of Ajdabiya , authorities said Friday . \nAlthough Gadhafi is feeling the pinch of more than 850 air sorties , the `` regime is still able and still determined to reinforce their positions , '' Gortney said . \nBritish Tornado fighter jets identified Libyan tanks with their weapons pointed north toward Ajdabiya and destroyed them , Air Vice Marshal Phil Osborn said Friday . \nThe British military released video of two such tanks bursting into flames and smoke . \nThe United Arab Emirates , meanwhile , announced it will send 12 aircraft in the coming days to help patrol and enforce the United Nations-mandated no-fly zone . \nAnd Turkey , once wary of military operations , agreed to the use of an eastern air base in Izmir as a sub-command station . \nOther Muslim nations participating in the Libya mission include Qatar , which will begin flying planes this weekend , and Kuwait and Jordan , which have agreed to provide humanitarian or logistical support . \nBut as the military operation continues , the situation for Libyans caught in battle zones grows more dire by the day , humanitarian agencies reported . \nThe United Nations refugee agency said Friday that increasing numbers of Libyans are displaced from their homes due to fighting . \nRefugees streaming out of Ajdabiya described chilling scenes . \n`` I could n't even begin to describe to you the horror that I have seen , '' one man told CNN . \n`` Leaving Ajdabiya we saw dead bodies in the street . \nNo one would ever dare go to recover them . '' \nCNN is not identifying Libyans it has interviewed for their own safety . \nAnother man said Gadhafi 's troops were going house to house in Ajdabiya , hunting for opposition members . \nHe said the troops took away five men from his neighbor 's house . \nHe did n't know what happened to them . \nEarly Friday , coalition warplanes roared again through Libyan skies , bombing the periphery of the capital where military bases are located . \nAnti-aircraft fire burst out but then fell silent . \nInternational reporters in Tripoli were escorted to farmlands east of Tripoli in Tajura , where Gadhafi 's government claims airstrikes killed civilians . \nReporters found no evidence of civilian deaths . \nTwo military bases along the way had been bombed and were still smoking Friday . \nIn Tajura , missile fragments lay scattered about a palm orchard and shrapnel had peppered walls of still-standing farm buildings . \nOne farmer told reporters that a missile landed about 8 p.m. Thursday , but there were no military installations nearby . \nThe missile gouged a small hole in a palm tree and sprayed debris that damaged windows and doors of the farm buildings . \nGadhafi has been keen to put out the word on collateral damage from the coalition 's airstrikes . \nInternational reporters were taken this week to a seaside cemetery in Tripoli where the funerals of 33 people allegedly killed in airstrikes were taking place . \nState television said the dead were victims of the `` crusader colonial aggression . '' \nCNN could not independently verify the circumstances of the deaths or who the victims were . \nIn Tripoli , CNN reporters go on government-organized tours in an effort to do their own reporting ; Libyan authorities forbid independent movement by international journalists in Tripoli . \nThe reports of civilian deaths have been given little credence by coalition forces . \n`` The only civilian casualties we know of for certain are the ones that the Libyan government itself has caused , '' Gortney has said . \nInstead , it is Gadhafi who is almost sure to face serious charges for his brutal crackdown on protesters , said a spokeswoman for the International Criminal Court . \nThe prosecutor of the court is `` 100 percent '' certain Gadhafi will face charges of crimes against humanity once an investigation has been completed , the spokeswoman said . \nMeanwhile , the Libyan delegation attending an African Union meeting in Ethiopia said the country is committed to a cease-fire and is ready to let the African Union monitor one . \n`` We demand the cessation of the air bombardment and the naval blockade carried out by Western forces and the United States for the invalidity of its argument to protect civilians since it is killing them by the hundreds and is attacking and destroying our armed forces and paving the way for the other side to attack , '' said Mohammed al-Zwai , speaker of the Libyan People 's Assembly . \nUnder an agreement reached Thursday , NATO forces will be able to close Libyan air space to all flights except humanitarian ones and will be able to use force in self-defense . \nMichael Burns , a former U.S. ambassador to NATO , said he expects the defense alliance to take over command of the entire operation in a few days to keep up pressure on Gadhafi . \nThe alliance said Friday that Canada 's Lt. Gen. Charlie Bouchard , stationed in Naples , Italy , will take the lead for the Libya mission . \n`` The no-flight zone alone can not protect the civilians of Libya , '' Burns told CNN . \n`` Gadhafi is still attacking . \n... He is still on the move in some places . '' \nU.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he has seen no signs of the cease-fire called for under U.N. Resolution 1973 , which was hurriedly passed March 17 , as Libyan forces were closing in on the rebel stronghold of Benghazi . \n`` To the contrary , fierce battles continue in and around the cities of Ajdabiya , Misrata and Zinan , '' Ban said Thursday , adding his envoy told Libyan authorities that if the government did not comply with the cease-fire resolution , `` the Security Council was prepared to take additional measures . '' \nThe Libyan conflict was sparked in February by protests against Gadhafi 's nearly 42-year rule . \nThe strongman responded with force against civilians , prompting the international community to take action beginning last weekend . \nCNN 's Nic Robertson , Arwa Damon , Elise Labott , Paula Newton and Jim Bittermann contributed to this report . \n"}

Rabasa , a member of the Bosnia Train and Equip Task Force in the early 1990s , is a senior political scientist at the RAND Corp. , a nonprofit institution whose mission is to help improve policy and decision-making through research and analysis . \n-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The no-fly zone and air strikes on military targets of the Gadhafi regime bear close parallels to events in Bosnia in autumn , 1995 , when NATO air strikes and the threat of further attacks halted the Bosnian Serb military onslaught against Bosnian Muslim targets . \nIf effective , the international action might prevent the Gadhafi forces from crushing the rebellion in Libya , but it will not end the conflict . \nThe Gadhafi regime retains overwhelming military superiority over the Benghazi-based Interim National Council . \nUnless the military imbalance is redressed , Gadhafi will retain the ability to threaten or renew his attacks on his opposition . \nAs long as this situation persists , international military involvement in Libya -- to enforce the no-fly zone and prevent ground attacks by Gadhafi 's forces -- will likely have to continue . \nWhat the United States did in Bosnia might hold the key for an effective response to the crisis in Libya . \nIn Bosnia , the United States sought to redress the military balance , which since the onset of the war in 1992 had heavily favored the Bosnian Serb army . \nShould coalition support Libyan rebels ? \nWhat could be the end game in Libya ? \nDespite the Europeans ' skepticism and dislike for the program , it succeeded . \nThe program raised donations of several hundred million dollars from Muslim countries , supervised the purchase of military equipment for the armed forces of the Federation and arranged for a U.S. contractor to train Federation troops . \nThe program also helped promote other U.S. objectives in Bosnia by diminishing Iranian influence and ensuring the departure of the foreign fighters . \nThe situations in Bosnia then and Libya now grow more alike as the violence in Libya evolves into prolonged conflict . \nDespite establishment of a no-fly zone over Libya , there is little reason to expect that air or naval power alone will dislodge Gadhafi from areas he controls . \nThe U.N. Security Council resolution that authorized the no-fly zone and all necessary measures to protect civilians under attack in Libya did not call for Gadhafi 's ouster . \nThere are reports that some Arab countries are considering deploying ground troops to Libya . \nBut if they do , their role would likely be protection of the civilian population in areas outside Gadhafi 's control . \nThat outcome would still leave Gadhafi in power in western Libya . \nThat leaves few effective options if the United States wants to prevent the crisis in Libya from leading to a prolonged armed conflict or de facto partition that leaves a ruthless , embittered dictator with a terrorist record in control of half the country . \nThat situation could have long-term destabilizing consequences for Libya and the Middle East . \nThe way out of this conundrum would be for the United States to clarify its goals in Libya . \nRecognizing that lasting stability could only come about as the result of the removal of Gadhafi from power , the United States and like-minded countries could begin by recognizing the Benghazi government as the legitimate government of Libya . \nThe Libyan National Council is , after all , a government set up by a popular uprising against tyranny and therefore inherently more legitimate than Gadhafi 's government in Tripoli . \nThe United States also might consider launching an effort to provide the Benghazi government with arms and equipment to defend itself against Gadhafi 's forces and to help it liberate western Libya . \nThe U.S. need not become directly involved in the training and equipping of the Libyan opposition . \nAs with the Bosnia train and equip program , a small U.S. team could help arrange for the purchase and delivery of arms , as well as supply training , possibly by third parties . \nThere are those who would caution that the United States does not know enough about the Libyan opposition to support it , but this is not entirely true . \nSome of the opposition leaders are former cabinet ministers and generals in the Libyan government , known to the United States and its allies . \nAs in all revolutions , a few of Libya 's opposition leaders have emerged from the rank and file of protesters . \nSome may be Islamists , but this was also true in Bosnia during that war . \nIf the U.S. were to simply stand aside , extremists could fill the gap , as occurred in the early days of the Bosnian war . \nThe U.S. decision to support victims of aggression paid off in Bosnia and advanced America 's interests and values . \nInvolvement on the side of the democracy movement in Libya would enable the United States to exercise a positive influence on Libya 's evolution and prevent destabilizing outcomes . \nThe opinions in this commentary are solely those of Angel M. Rabasa . \n"}

Is killing Muslims & destroying Mosques the example of Muslim leadership to set in the world . \nIs this the Nation of Islam , that we should look up to ??? 2 - Where is Muslim Brotherhood ? \nIs it just a label of a group of fanatics used to extort or blackmail the West ??? 3 - How come the West have moved to protect defensless muslims in Libya , Egypt , Tunisia etc. , and Muslims Leaders together with their so called Arab league has not moved a finger to help suffering Muslims ? \n4 - Is n't it time , for these Muslim leaders , to grow up , take responsibility , clean up their dirty wash , and stop crying to the West for aid & dole outs ?? 5 - Why has the Azhar and other supposedly scholarly institutions , not decree a ` Fatwa ' condemning Gadafi & his like to be infidels , that all Muslims should prosecute , and carry out a ` Gihad ' against him until he is brought to justice ...

\nWe do not have enough fingers to plug up the holes of so many dikes ! \nThis whole thing is really getting insane . \nThe other night , I watched as we shot over $ 136 million dollars worth of Tomahawk Missiles into Libya . \nI thought , Jeez , that money could have really come in handy to those of us here at home who are suffering , and looking for a place to sleep , and a warm meal , and perhaps retraining for a job which they can sustain their families with . \nI will share an acronym with you , Fareed . \nIt 's called POTS , which stands for Pandemic of Terminal Stupidity . \nFeel free to use it . \nMarch 24 , 2011 at 1:23 pm | Reply Not all situations are equal risk for equal results . \nAlbeit Clintons great regret was doing nothing in Rowanda , Bush took us on an adventure in Iraq and Afghanistan , the crimes of the Ivory Coast are off the chart . \nWe ca n't fight them all and more than likely we will have little say about the futures of Bush 's wars . \nRight now there are two big issues on the table . \nIn North Africa there are three nations facing the possible light of democracy . \nTunesia , Egypt , and Lybia each have there own issues to find the path to democracy . \nIf one falls off the path it can take down the other two . \n15 % of the population of Lybia is Egypsian workers for example . \nIf we ` can invest a smal air war to support freedom in that 3 nation stretch its a triple homerun . \nImagine an out of the park victory for the moderates of the world . \nThat could bring true peace to the west of Isreal that is really lasting . \nThe other problem is the middle east proper . \nKing Abdoulla of Saudi Arabia vrs the Iatolla 's in Iran . \nBahrain is ruled by Suni , like King Abdoulla of Saudi Arabia . \nYemen is also ruled by Suni , but Syria is friendly to the Shiites that are friendly with Iran , supply hezbolla with weapons and so forth . \nMy money is on King Abdoulla and his 500,000 man USA trained military . \nWhy does this all matter to you ? \nWell in Europe they pay $ 7 to $ 8 usd pergallon for gasoline . \nWe spend enmass on the 5th and 6th fleets to keep trade routes and our business partners safe in the middle East . \nIf we stop supporting the King , get your wallet out and we will pay like the rest of the world for gas . \nIn fact with the current speculation we will face an estimated $ 9.50 oper gallon in the USA . \nWhy dont we `` Drill Baby Drill '' ? \nRon Reagan was a really smart guy . \nHis Idea was we use everyone elses oil first before we touch the massive oil reserves in the USA and the Artic . \nWe can argue , fiddle , fight , and all sorts of things until the world is dry of oil before we even think to begin to drill what we can . \nHe implied in policy that there will be a day , when nations fight for food , water , and of course oil . \nThe nation that runs out of oil reserves will lose that war . \nWhile we were plaing in Iraq and Afghanistan , China made massive investments in Africa . \nLybia sells the lions share of their light crude to China , thus the 30,000 Chinese workers in Lybia . \nSub Saharan African is all locked up on oil by China . \nMeanwhile Saudi Arabia is starting to run out as is Mexico and a few other places we get oil . \nEstimates on those feilds are falling dramatically and the Saudi 's have failed to miss estimates for 5 quarters . \nMexico like Venezuala nationalized the oil industry and stuck it to every oil company that did the exploration like Texico in the day and now no one trusts them to do business . \nSo now it really boils down to that nut job in Iran vrs King Abdoulla . \nRemember the Saudi protesters are the Shiite group that 12 of the 199\\/11 hijackers came from . \nSo we are betting on this Arab Sping to grow into Iran and Syria at the same time that we want Jordan , Baharain , and I raq to hang with King Abdulla . \nYemen will likely end up in total chaos , and get its tail kicked by either King Abdulla or the USA . \nThe uprising in Yemen is Al Quieda in the Arab Pennesula demanding their own country . \nThe USA currently spends 150 million a year with the `` president of Yemen '' to fight AQAP . \nThey control more than half the country and bombed the USS Cole . \nI hope this explains the whole picture to you . \nMarch 26 , 2011 at 8:14 pm | Reply Thank you , Randy , for interesting reading . '' \n... Remember the Saudi protesters are the Shiite group that 12 of the 199\\/11 hijackers came from ... '' - are the 12 of 19 shia , indeed ? \nAl Qaeda is fundamentally sunny organization , I believe , furthermore it is on the extreme end of this shia to sunny spectrum , and bin Laden has ideological differences with both Iran and Qaddafi . \nMarch 27 , 2011 at 5:57 pm | Ohh I forgot one thing , I 'm a WASP young guy that lives in the Phillippines , work in China and Korea , but still keep an apartment in San Diego . \nI make a living on understanding the worlds economic issues . \nAs a former Kansan and US soldier with a degree in economics I feel sad about the USA . \nWe can solve this countries problems with common sense but we refuse to do so . \nWe spend 300 billion dollars a year and 500,000 Americans are killed by smoking every single year , why is that not outlawed ? \nIf you want to smoke sign a waiver that we need not spend $ 250,000 usd trying to apply palative care when you get stage IV non small cell lung cancer . \nOther wise if a cop see 's you smoking you go to jail and get fined $ 20,000 usd . \nWe spend 1 trillion dollars a year on 4 single issues like that which would balance the budget as fast as the congress can write the bills . \nSecondly we need four investments in the USA and a new 18 % flat tax . \n# 1 Invade Mexico and end the drug war combined with a real fence like Isreal has and seems to be impossible to pass . \nGive Amnesty to those in country along with a $ 50,000 usd price tag per man or woman . \nThey can pay $ 100 a week payments until they earn their citizenship , and pay their back taxes or get out and dont come back . \n10 years hard labor if they try to sneak back in the USA . \nMexico is our largest customer and business is bad because of the drug wars . \nMore people die each year in Mexico than get killed in Iraq or Afghanistan . \n# 2 Lead the world in High Speed Rail so a worker in Indiana can get a job in Detroit 300 miles away and get to work in 45 minutes . \nIn China that high speed national rail system drpped unemployement by 4 % . \nIn South Korea it dropped unemployent by 6 % . \nIn South Korea I visit a factory built at a manufacturing hub 190 km south of Seoul every year . \nIt takes me 30 min to get to that manufacturing area where 95,000 people work in 300 factories . \nShuttle buses take people from the rail to factories like clock work . \nMuch the same in China quarter million jobs after about 9 months training . \nLike IKES Interstate highway system that took 6 months to set up and 12 years to build . \n# 3 Complete President Obama ; s -LRB- actually the brain trust at MIT designed the new electrical grid system called `` Smart '' It starts with the meter on your house , new wiring all through , new smart transformers , and Nano Technology integrated into the new power grid . \nCurrently it will be done in 2025 when its 10 years out of date . \nIf we hire and train 250,000 men today it would be done in 36 months . \nThousands of factories ca n't come to the USA cause our utilities are out dated and every new factory requires a multi million dollar invesrtment in direct power lines to the factory from the source . \nWe rank 61rst of 168 countreis in our Utility techniology in use . \nThe new power grid will cut lost energey amounting to 35 % of what we use in the USA more than enough to cover the oil we buy from outside the USA . \nIt will cut everyones electric bill by 26 % . \n# 4 High Speed Boadband the new advanced model that is only available in 3 US cities like Chatanooga . \nA Dr can email a massive file like a ct scan over this in real time . \nThat speed is available in all of Europe . \nAlso let me point out when I 'm in Europe my cell phone works in Spain or Sweden and there are no zones or coverage areas . \nWere a really 8th rate gaggle in our wireless networks and half assed cell towers . \n# 5 Get rid of the IRS and its half million workers . \nFlat tax the country at 18 % for every corporation , partnership , or individual in the USA . \nWe will save 490 billion a year in cost . \n-LRB- Not counting what we pay to get our taxes done -RRB- Corporations like Exxon wont be tax free and earn 10 billion net a year , or GE 5.1 billion and also pay nothing on a 24,000 page tax return thar will never be seriously looked at cause the IRS has no time . \nMarch 26 , 2011 at 8:56 pm | Reply Thanks for the thoughtful and insightful article . \nToo many of your colleagues shoot from the hip with their superficial criticisms and vacuous questions , which they accompany with no analysis and no answer . \nNeither you nor the President , nor any of us , will get it right all of the time , but at least there are some , like you and the President , who use their minds to reason and articulate , and disregard the bombast . \nMarch 24 , 2011 at 7:47 pm | Reply Your insight in the Libya situation and other world issues is always welcomed . \nI have a question however , and maybe you can answere it . \nWhy does CNN and many of their commentary guests relative to Libya , refere to gadaffi as `` Colonel Gadaffi '' ? \nIs this individual actually a commisioned military colonel , or is that just an aquired `` nick name '' . \nTo me , he absolutely does not deserve the true commission title of `` Colonel '' . \nRefering to and addressing this terrorist and yet to be determined `` war ciminal '' as `` Colonel '' , is to me , to very offensive . \nUnless he has a genuine claim to the commision of Colonel , I would suggest that CNN and all other media , STOP USING THE TERM `` COLONEL '' in the context of this gadaffi buffoon ! \nMarch 24 , 2011 at 10:32 pm | Reply Yes , he is professional military man by training and by service and he was commissioned\\/raised to colonel rank by King Idris - the king whom Qaddafi and group of his fellow officers ousted back in 1969 . \nBecause of his modesty for which he is well known , he did not promote himself to general , generalissimus , or whatever other title dictators usually invent for themselves , and stayed in colonel rank throughout his entire 42-year tenure . \nSo there is nothing wrong with CNN calling him `` Colonel Qaddafi '' , or simply `` Colonel '' . \nMarch 25 , 2011 at 8:21 pm | Reply You know ... the internet is a very useful tool in learning information like the knowledge you are apparently looking for -LRB- an badly need -RRB- . \nIf you would have simply took the 15 seconds to `` google '' Colonel Gadhafi ... you would have saved yourself from looking like an uneducated fool . \nSad but True March 26 , 2011 at 11:35 am | Reply OK . \nHopefully the `` colonel '' part is sorted out . \nNow let 's sort out the use of term `` war criminal '' and the implied `` use of air strikes against populated areas '' by Qaddafi and `` slaughter of innocent civilians '' , `` atrocities '' , etc : It is actually NOT PROVEN at this point . \nNot by Al Jazira . \nNot found on Youtube . \nSurely , Qaddafi had used tanks and multiple rocket launchers : we saw them very clearly in reports by CNN correspondent Nick Robertson . \nAnd , presumably , these tanks fired their guns sometimes . \nAnd presumably some bombs were dropped by Qaddafi airplanes . \nAnd presumably all these tanks were used to intimidate civilians when they entered into a city or town . \nBut what about showing destruction of civilian homes We clearly so Qaddafi residence destroyed by NATO cruise missiles , and crater left in some port , but what about showing destroyed civilian homes in Benghazi or elsewhere in rebel-controlled territory . \nCan anyone on this board ... After all , tanks a routinely used to intimidate peaceful demonstrators throughout the world . \nWe saw tanks in Egypt recently . \nIn Bahrein , etc. . . \nMarch 26 , 2011 at 5:55 pm | Reply I womder @ the reactions 2 the Libyan issue . \nThe leaders of d nations of d world cant just ignore despots or d guise in any manner . \nthe world wil drift into anarchy . \nHwever these are just signs of d biblical winding down prophesied . \nNo doubt these cruel treacherous leaders will be consumed . \nHang more of such will still be recorded March 25 , 2011 at 12:19 am | Reply It 's almost comical the way western leaders play to the gallery and invest huge sums in military theatrics that achieve little . \nIt seems evident that it 's economic interest more that anything else that influences the west especially America . \nSo Gbagbo can choose to ignore the peoples vote and continue his illegitimate rule without as much as a look in from America . \nOnce oil interests show up , America 's moralistic gibberish spews forth . \nIt 's not about care for the Libyans , Egyptians or Saudis , it 's the oil `` stupid '' ! \nMarch 25 , 2011 at 5:22 am | Reply March 25 , 2011 at 6:46 pm | Reply 2011-03-25 14:53:31 : -LRB- -RRB- 1196 # # cents # # # cents cents March 25 , 2011 at 7:58 pm | Reply Italian film scientist discovers skin and hair on face body of the Shroud of Turin . \nThree toes ripped off left foot see Vincenzo Ruello youtube March 26 , 2011 at 4:45 am | Reply I 've heard that CBS executives have made Gadhafi a very generous offer to abandon his rule in Libya and accept the lead role in the new `` Two and a Half Men '' , filling in the vacancy left after the firing of Charlie Sheen . \nApparently CBS feels they can work easier with Moammar and feel he is a bit more `` stable '' over the long term . \nMarch 26 , 2011 at 11:39 am | Reply America and England are alike two brothers in a dark room trying to create light . \nFirst it had to be learned , then taught to others , now metasized to the world . \nIt 's a growing process that requires time and learning to grow up . \nCivil rights , and the abundance of issues are still being learned so do n't expect instant perfection . \nFrance is the 3rd in this trio and all the harsh words come from those who are less educated and lower in the cycle of learning . \nNow in places from Germany , Japan , South Korea , and so on we have helped inspire generations of like minded individuals . \nSo it 's 2011 and the troubles in Tunisia , Egypt , and Lybia are the child bearing pains of new democracies . \nHave faith that the solid middle class or moderate minded will win in the end . \nWait and watch as our leaders risk political capital on the idea that these Arabic Speaking people can find their way onto the path of true Civil Democratic ideals . \nMarch 26 , 2011 at 7:18 pm | Reply Yah , you are right Ericson and I think it will be longed journey before any American and England governments can have that light ! \nAs they -LRB- US - UK + UN -RRB- caused those darkness much much wider in scope more than ever ! \nMarch 26 , 2011 at 7:46 pm | Reply I have little faith in governments , but do believe when someone like President Obama really sticks his neck out for an idea or a group of people . \nI agree there is a bias against sub-saharan Africa and it 's probably a racial matter . \nThe USA has never gone to war to defend those people . \nI predict that Ghadaffi will fall on May 1 after a pounding by our planes , and that he will cut a deal to not go to jail and keep his money and be allowed to retire somewhere like Venezuala . \nThe mans a coward and he will leave all those with him now to suffer the world courts . \nMay day is the likely date as it will take time to beat down his 250,000 military of which 105,000 are army March 26 , 2011 at 9:14 pm | thanks , but this vividly indicates the road map for col.

Security Council voted to enforce a no-fly zone over Libya . \nThat 's part of the military operation that 's been firing missiles and running airstrikes . \nIt 's been led by the U.S. Yesterday , there was talk of a deal that would make NATO , the North Atlantic Treaty Organization , the leader of the operation . \nBut that was n't set in stone , and there was some doubt about it . \nOne interesting point about the conflict in Libya is how it could affect gas prices in the U.S. Libya produces about 2 percent of the world 's crude oil ; it 's not very much . \nBut some stock traders are afraid that the trouble there could happen in other countries that produce more oil . \nThat fear is one reason why oil prices are rising in the stock market . \nAnd that means gas prices are more likely to increase too , since crude oil accounts for about 65 percent of what we spend on gas . \nNow , getting back to the military operation . \nDiana Magnay is on the ship that some of those airstrikes are launching from . \nShe gives an idea of what life is like there . \nDIANA MAGNAY , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : Each night they fly , Harrier jets off the USS Kearsarge , bound for Libya . \nU.S. strike missions to take out Gadhafi 's air defense and attack capabilities as rebels clash with Gadhafi 's forces . \nCAPTAIN MIKE WYRSCH , HARRIER FIGHTER PILOT : It was pretty neat the next day after the first attacks , to see that the rebel forces , their morale once they saw that they had people coming to help them out . \nBut it 's breaking their supply chains as well as slowing down their advance onto Benghazi by taking out their tanks and artillery . \nMAGNAY : Day times are about maintenance and repair , checking over these V-22 Ospreys , which had their first outing in Operation Odyssey Dawn early Tuesday morning . \nA daring rescue mission with a team of 30 Marines to find a U.S. fighter pilot who ejected over eastern Libya after his F-15 fighter jet suffered what the military called mechanical failure . \nThe pilot 's back in the medical facilities here on board . \nHis other crew member , the weapons officer , also had to eject , but landed in a completely different location . \nSo , he was rescued first by rebel forces and is now back on a U.S. Air Force base in northern Italy . \nThere are around 700 Marines on board , but this is n't a war which involves coalition ground forces . \nThe Kearsarge 's six Harrier jets taking the active role in enforcing the U.N.-mandated no-fly zone REAR ADMIRAL MARGARET KLEIN , COMMANDER , EXPEDITIONARY STRIKE GROUP FIVE : If there are vehicles on the ground that can shoot down our aircraft which are enforcing the no-fly zone , we consider that a legal mandate to be able attack that equipment . \nMAGNAY : Precision targeting , 500-pound laser-guided bombs , and the sorties continue . \nNo sign here that this part of the offensive is over yet . \nDiana Magnay , CNN , on the Kearsarge in the Mediterranean . \nAZUZ : Syria is the latest country to deal with the political unrest that we 've seen around the Middle East and North Africa recently . \nSyria is located between Iraq and Turkey . \nAnd people there have been protesting over economic and human rights issues . \nThose demonstrations have gotten violent in the past few days , with protesters and security forces fighting on the streets of at least one city . \nHuman rights workers say at least 34 people have been killed in the violence this week . \nAnd that includes a soldier who was reportedly shot because he refused to fire on the protesters . \nThousands of people came out on Thursday for the funerals of that soldier and some of the other people who 've been killed . \nAZUZ : Toyota , the car company , might shut down some of its U.S. manufacturing temporarily because it does n't have enough parts . \nThere 's been a delay in getting those parts from Japan because of Japan 's recent earthquake and tsunami . \nInside Japan , workers are still trying to get things stabilized at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant . \nThese pictures were taken inside the plant . \nTwo of the workers were taken to the hospital yesterday after they accidentally stepped in contaminated water . \nOfficials say the men could be all right if they 're quickly decontaminated . \nA U.S. Navy aircraft carrier is going through a similar process right now . \nMartin Savidge , you 're on deck . \nMARTIN SAVIDGE , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Right now , every piece of hardware , every aircraft and every piece of machinery used to move that aircraft is on the front of the USS Ronald Reagan . \nAnd you can see a lot of the crew hands . \nYou 're wondering maybe why are they all sitting around ? \nWell , we 'll show you . \nLook what 's going on back over here : water . \nLots and lots of water just being sprayed all over the deck right now , in what is probably the biggest cleanup effort you 're ever likely to see at sea . \nAZUZ : You ca n't help scrub down the deck of the Ronald Reagan . \nBut you can support the victims of these natural disasters in Japan . \nGo the Spotlight section on our home page , CNNStudentNews.com . \nClick on the `` Impact Your World '' link , and find out how you can help . \nTOMEKA JONES , CNN STUDENT NEWS : Today 's Shoutout goes out to Ms. Mielke 's world cultures classes at Gorzycki Middle School in Austin , Texas ! \nWhat type of food is a peanut ?

Gerard Hueber , chief of staff for the coalition Odyssey Dawn . \nThe coalition is able to strike at forces moving toward cities , but once they are inside city limits , dropping bombs with enough precision to avoid civilian casualties is difficult . \nBefore the war , Libya had about 500 mortars and 2,400 pieces of artillery . \nGadhafi had close to 2,000 tanks and armored vehicles to move around , but much was poorly maintained . \nLibya 's elite forces come from tribes loyal to Gadhafi , dedicated to protecting the regime . \nThe 32nd Brigade , for instance , is commanded by one of Gadhafi 's sons . \nThose forces total , at most , 10,000 men . \nThey are better paid and better equipped , said Gawdat Bahgat , a military analyst at National Defense University , with tanks and conventional weapons . \nThose elite forces are on the offense . \nU.S. surveillance planes have seen some attacks by the elite units . \n`` Those forces are fully engaged in this conflict , that are attacking those civilian populations , '' Hueber said . \nThe Gadhafi forces remain capable of carrying out attacks on the opposition , a U.S. official told CNN . \nThey are relatively well organized and continue to fight effectively in certain parts of the country , said the unnamed official , who is not authorized to speak on the record . \nThe rebels have gained some additional battle space due to coalition efforts , the official said . \nRebels are in a better position than they were a few days ago , but the Gadhafi forces have the upper edge at this point in time , the official said . \nHowever , where possible , the coalition is hitting the forces on the ground , arguing it is within the mission of protecting civilians . \n`` Gadhafi 's forces are feeling the strain of several weeks of fighting without any resupply , '' the official said . \n`` In Ajdabiya to Misurata , our targeted priorities are mechanized forces , those mobile integrated -- those mobile surface-to-air missile sites , interdicting their lines of communications which supply their beans and their bullets , their command-and-control , and any opportunities for sustainment of that activity , '' Hueber said Wednesday . \n"}

{"id": "363", "time": "2011-03-23", "text": "Ezra Klein thinks there are better things to do with our money : The easy response to this is to ask how I can be so diffident in the face of slaughter . \nBut consider Obama s remarks . \nLeft unchecked , he said , we have every reason to believe that Gaddafi would commit atrocities against his people . \nMany thousands could die . \nEvery year , one million people die from malaria . \nAbout three million children die , either directly or indirectly , due to hunger . \nThere is much we could due to help the world if we were willing . \nThe question that needs to be asked is : Why this ? \nWhat are our interests in Libya ? \nRichard Haas argues that the U.S. doesn t have any , anyway : '' U.S. interests are decidedly less than vital . \nLibya accounts for only 2 percent of world oil production . \nThe scale of the humanitarian crisis is not unique ; indeed , this is not strictly speaking a humanitarian intervention . \nIt is a decision to participate in Libya 's civil war . \n`` I understand the humanitarian impulse to help the underdog , but we have finite resources , and can not hold ourselves responsible for the political freedom of every human being on Earth . \nAs many others have said , the obvious problem with this action is that we must set the pretty gauzy-sounding benefits of influencing public opinion in the Middle East , avenging ourselves for the Pan Am bombing , possibly improving the lives of people in Libya and so forth , against the many ways that this could plausibly turn into a much more expensive proposition than is currently anticipated and not only in terms of money . '' \nWho are we helping ? \nFriedman further holds that we don t know who we are helping : '' ... we should be doubly cautious of intervening in places that could fall apart in our hands , a l Iraq , especially when we do not know , a l Libya , who the opposition groups really are democracy movements led by tribes or tribes exploiting the language of democracy ? '' \nJames Fallows says that the American military rarely asks this essential question : `` Count me among those very skeptical of how this commitment was made and where it might lead . \nThe most predictable failure in modern American military policy has been the reluctance to ask , And what happens then ? \nWe invade Iraq to push Saddam Hussein from power . \nObama increases our commitment in Afghanistan and says that `` success '' depends on the formation of a legitimate , honest Afghan government on a certain timetable . \nWhat happens then ? '' \nNext up : five arguments in favor of intervention . \nIt 's a UN resolution , not a U.S. invasion . \nAnd we ca n't stay -- we 're tied up . \nOther countries are going to have to take the lead on this , as they are . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 4:24 pm | Reply So which country is stepping up to take the lead so we can leave ? \nIn your reply please also include the link of a credible news organization article that has the country taking the lead from the U.S. DECLARING it is doing so . \nUntil then its just wishful thinking . \nNATO just refused to take the lead due to Turkey voting no and that is the only organization capable of coordinating this kind of coalition operation besides the U.S. , whoops . \nThat has been an act of war for thousands of years . \nSo this should never be treated as a geesh moment . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 4:51 pm | Reply Hmmm ... Did n't Ronald Reagan send jet fighters to bomb Libya back in the ' 80 ? '' \nHow would you catergorize that ? \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 9:12 pm | Leave ? \nAre we even there ? \nWe do n't have ground troops . \nDo you know what war is ? \nWhy are you so stupid ? \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 11:36 pm | It 's easy to criticize , but the alternatives always have consequences . \nPeople should have to consider the consider those consequences before criticizing . \nI see 5 people who think more innocent Libyans should die . \nI 'd like to write an article criticizing them ! \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 5:16 pm | Reply And yet , RIGHT NOW , children are dying from starvation all over Sub-Sahara Africa . \nPeople are being killed in Congo . \nThe Japanese are be radiated . \nWhy this and why now ? \nFood and medical supplies are one thing , dropping bombs and picking sides is another . \nWhy is it STILL our responsiblity to be the policeman of the world ? \nWhy wo n't the Arab League , whom have alot more vested interest in this crisis then we do , not sending troops and\\/or enforcing a no-fly zone ? \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 8:08 pm | Ozmodius , becasuse no one else has the balls to step up , nor the means to do so . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 9:40 pm | If all it takes to satisfy your itch is to criticize someone , hell , do it and shut the H. . . \nup My son is over there , and even if I criticize , it wo n't bring him back any faster !!!!!!!!!!!!!

\nMarch 23 , 2011 at 6:02 pm | Reply I am disapointed people are so skeptible to freedom its as if they forget we forgot about ours . \nand their is no way we would have won our reveloution without the help of france . \nso we r just trying to help people who r trying to become free . \nand our foriegn interest how about us having the moral responsibility to save peoples lives , because if we do n't help gadhaffi will kill his citizens . \nany way all we have done right now is bomb them we didnt invade it , but i do believe we need to think about what to do next and how to help them with only airstrikes and bombings on military bases threatening the freedom of innocent people . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 6:23 pm | Reply Actually , and this is something I hate seeing when I go down past the signs to Yorktown Battlefield , the France that helped us was the Kingdom of France , not the Third Republic that exists now . \nYet the tricolor is shown on the signs at Yorktown . \nYes , French peasants came over here and helped us fight with aristocrats over them as officers . \nHowever , when they revolted against their King we sat aside and did nothing , absolutely nothing . \nIt 's a wonder anyone 's trusted us as allies since . \nAs for another point I 'd like to make : The American Revolution was income tax evasion on the largest scale ever seen . \nWe were subjects of the King of England , France owned Quebec down to what we now know as Maine . \nDuring the Seven Years War the French attacked colonials , did we raise an army to fight ? \nWe left that up to the King to send troops to fight for us . \nThe taxes he imposed were to pay off the cost of having to ship troops over to the Colonies in order to fight in our defense . \nWe had more than enough manpower to raise an army at the time , militias are not an army because they often lack the courage to stand their ground when faced with professional soldiers . \nAs well as they allowed too many of the officers to argue with superiors who were placed in authority based off of who they know or who their father 's were , not skill at leading men into battle , nor being able to inspire men . \nEngland helped defend us from becoming all French , since we dislike them so much and seem to think they ca n't fight -LRB- they seemed able to hold the Germans back for quite some time during World War One with what help the British could offer -RRB- seems that was what we wanted . \nSeems people have forgotten the things we 've done in our pasts . \nMaybe we should try understanding that while war is terrible , this new century of warfare has nothing on the last . \nFour years = 20 million or more dead , that was World War One . \nIn roughly six months worth of actual combat the American Expeditionary Force lost 50,000 dead and hundreds of thousands wounded , today the American people would call John J. `` Black Jack '' Pershing a murderer . \nAt the time he was hailed as the greatest hero America had of the time . \nSo why do n't all the doomsayers and those that want to espouse opinions without allowing their brains to digest the true information try looking back at what has happened before ? \nI am currently trying to re-enlist in the US military . \nNot because I have to , not because someone told me I should , but because it 's the right thing to do . \nMarch 24 , 2011 at 9:09 am | Yaa the french wanted to take the colonies over at first but that was in the very beginning were there were very few colonist and actual american 's -LRB- born in america -RRB- and they only attacked then after that the french indian war they only attacked the ohio river valley which as claimed as both french and british , in fact the british strted making bases there and the french were just defending `` their '' land -LRB- thats what president polk did to start the U.s. mexican war -RRB- then pershing actually gave his troops training . \nhe refused to let untrained americans fight in trench warfare and that saved lives . \nand it was in trenches the only way to move was to risk lives , it was a deadlock between france and germany -LRB- hitler actualy was a runner in one of the trenches -RRB- they made hundreds of miles of trenches and then neither moved they just shot spied and maurdered . \nWhen pershimg sent the toops he sent them with training so more could live and almost every1 in the u.s. at the time would do anything to stop germany and the kaiser March 25 , 2011 at 4:19 pm | What was the name of that country that had a revolution and a super power -LRB- France -RRB- came in to help win that revolt ? \nOh yeah , it was America . \nAmerica and the rest of the world has a moral obligation to help those who can not help themselves , especially when their government is killing civilians . \nI use the term government loosely ; Gaddafi is a thug and in no way represents a legitimate government . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 9:13 pm | Reply That is a legitimate argument Mike D ! \nAlbeit a world coalition not a U.S led operation . \nMarch 26 , 2011 at 1:49 am | From the libyan intervention with no clear objective , it is clear that the west is restless with its weapons . \nU. S , and Europe have so much and highly sophisticated weapons that they do not know what to do with . \nThis is more true when juxtaposed with the fact that there are ` real ' wars now , only occupations . \nSo the U.S and Europe are looking for the slightest opportunity to use their weapons that are getting ` rusty ' . \nThere is no objective in this misplaced libyan war . \nU.S and their allies have said Ghaddafi is not the target . \nThen who is the target ? \nI know Obama is against the libyan war but he allowed himself to get forced into it . \nObama did n't get it the first time because he was looking for a way to dodge the war but could n't see it initially . \nThe easy way for Obama to dodge the idea that the neoconservative american interventionist forces were selling to him on the need to start another war was for him -LRB- Obama -RRB- to seek the approval of the congress . \nBut he did n't and was cowed into staging an unconstitutional war without getting the congress ' nod . \nMarch 24 , 2011 at 6:07 am | Reply The President of the United States by law has the ability to commit American forces to any conflict for up to 30 days before seeking a decleration of war from the Congress . \nTruman did it in Korea , which was never actually called a war while it was happening . \nGahdafi needs to go , he 's a tyrant that gets his jollies by harming the innocent . \nThe hell with what the rest of the world thinks the right thing to do is the right thing to do . \nAs for the whole `` Americans getting restless with our weapons , the Europeans are more experts on that than us . \nRemember there was a period of twenty or more years that they went through an arms race , forming internal alliances before finally the powder keg caught it 's spark . \nThe spark came on June 28 , 1914 , the resulting explosion is what we now call the First World War . \nThey could n't even handle that peace treaty without allowing their vindictiveness to blur the lines between vengeance and justice . \nI 'm glad Europe is trying to help in Libya , but it 's ironic that they used to own that area , so if Iraq and Afghanistan are `` America 's mess '' how would they feel if we left Libya to them as `` Europe 's mess '' ? \nMarch 24 , 2011 at 8:54 am | That would be wonderful if the U.N. had ever won a war against anyone . \nThe last time the U.N. led a coalition into an actual war was sixty one years ago . \nAll we got out of that was 36,000 dead Americans , millions of dead from the two countries we were fighting in , and who knows how many from the other coalition members . \nA country that is still divided along the same line as it was when that war began . \nThat 's called the Korean War . \nThe U.N. is as useless as the League of Nations was . \nThe League could n't nor did they try to stop Nazi Germany , Japan and Mussolini 's Italy from just walking out on them . \nWhat did that get us ? \nOh that 's right , another `` War To End All Wars '' . \nGahdafi is murdering his people , that 's different from diseases doing the same . \nNo government has the right to rule by fear and terrorizing of their own people . \nWe stood up against that during the Second World War and thankfully Obama is doing it now . \nI do n't support all of what he does because recently he 's been sounding more and more like Woodrow Wilson . \nHe 's been smart enough to avoid using the phrase `` America is too proud to fight '' a cowards defense against war that he used to keep us out of the Great War for so long . \nYet an untold number of Americans went and fought on both sides for what they believed in before the U.S. got involved in 1917 . \nNo , we do n't need to commit troops to battle , but it seems glaringly obvious that the Libyan Opposition needs better training , Noncommissioned Officers and officers who know how to organize their troops and fight . \nIf they lose , the result will be equivelent to what Hitler called `` the Final Solution '' . \nMarch 24 , 2011 at 8:47 am | Reply Why us ? \ncause we can and should step in especially when they come asking for help . \ni love how people think we should stay out cause we having nothing to do with them , but we do . \nthis is a planet we live on and everyone has the right to rule themselves how the people see fit . \ni say hell no , we help them make a better country for themselves , unlike Iraq were we forced it upon them . \nalso with out foreign powers stepping into help rebels claim there sovereignty we would still be part of the united kingdom . \nthe french saved us now we are helping the french save Libya . \nremember we are humans first and foremost , and that should out weigh the idea of American and Libyan March 24 , 2011 at 10:48 am | Reply March 25 , 2011 at 10:17 am | Reply It 's not our affair . \nThey did not attack another country . \nIt is a Libyan affair March 23 , 2011 at 4:32 pm | Reply In theory , we 're not actually committing to any extended period of time . \nWe are helping establish the no-fly zone by Tomahawking the regime 's air defense into very small pieces . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 4:36 pm | Reply Are you serious ? \nWhich war have we entered and after the first salvos , we have let someone else finish the mess ? \nWar is unpredictable event as we should have learned in Korea , Vietnam and Iraq . \nLet us take care of the economic decline we are in and let the world fend for themselves . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 4:45 pm | Reply Obama 's decision to participate in this civil war is baffling . \nThere is no compelling reason to believe that French and other foreign help is more then enough to help the Libyan people kick out Ghaddafi , without involving us . \nAnd the last leader that tried to fight on 3 fronts was Hitler , and everybody knows the results . \nThis thing can easily blow up in our faces and become another Vietnam . \nDabbling in other country 's revolutions carries that risk . \nAre n't two wars enough ?

{"id": "131", "time": "2011-03-23", "text": "By the CNN Wire Staff What do the rebels want ? \nNEW : Officials invite journalists to tour damaged house , but ca n't find it Tripoli suburb of Tajura is struck , a government official says Coalition effort is not `` a land invasion , '' according to U.S. official Hospital patients and doctors paralyzed by fear Tune in to `` AC360 '' for the latest on the airstrikes in Libya . \nWatch `` AC360 '' at 10 p.m. ET Wednesday on CNN . \nTripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The coalition air effort to halt the Libyan government 's attacks on civilians continued into Thursday for a sixth day , with an airstrike in the Tripoli suburb of Tajura , a government official said . \nOn Wednesday night , the government reported that military and civilian locations in the neighborhood of Al-Jfara and in the Tagora district of the capital had been struck by `` crusading colonial '' bombardment . \nIn response , Joint Task Force Operation Odyssey Dawn Lt. Cmdr. Jim Hoeft said in an e-mail to CNN , `` It is not likely that civilians were a part of any airstrike today . '' \nHe said coalition forces `` have been using all necessary measures to protect the citizens of Libya from the violence and killing inflicted upon them by Colonel Gadhafi . '' \nAn opposition activist in Tripoli accused state media of lying about civilian victims of the coalition airstrikes . \nFor example , she said , she was accompanying a cousin to a hospital for medical care when she saw a TV producer asking some people to close their eyes and play dead and others to pretend they were wounded . \nSome of the `` wounded , '' she said , were soldiers in civilian garb . \nRebels help rescue U.S. serviceman People appeared apprehensive , anxious . \nOpponents of Gadhafi were afraid to speak publicly . \nIn Ajdabiya , parts of the city fell to opposition forces even though Gadhafi 's men , who had been pounding the area with artillery and heavy tank bombardments , retained control of the northern and western gates , opposition fighters and witnesses told CNN . \nA hospital staffer and opposition fighters said nine people were killed Wednesday in fighting near the northern gate . \nSo far , the coalition has crippled the Libyan air force , and established a no-fly zone that spans Libya from east to west along its coastline , said U.S. Navy Rear Adm. Gerard Hueber . \nHueber , the chief of staff for U.S. operations said Wednesday that coalition planes had flown 175 sorties over Libya -- 113 of them by U.S. planes . \nBut the coalition had no indication that Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi was complying with a United Nations mandate to stop attacks against civilians . \nOn Wednesday , troops loyal to Gadhafi terrorized residents of the besieged rebel-held city of Misrata . \nOne witness said Gadhafi 's forces had attacked the city 's main hospital , where 400 people -- about half of them patients -- were located . \nThe push began at 8 p.m. -LRB- 2 p.m. ET -RRB- , when `` heavy tanks for Gadhafi troops start attacking the hospital -- the bombs falling here 20 meters -LRB- 66 feet -RRB- around us , '' said one person inside the hospital . \nHe said two deaths had occurred `` around the hospital . '' \nAt one point , shelling occurred without respite for 40 minutes , he said . \n`` Now , fortunately , no more shelling , but the situation is so serious that all the teams here -- the doctors , the patients -- are paralyzed , scared . '' \nHe called for international intervention to protect the civilians inside the institution . \n`` Nobody can work here , '' he said . \nAmbulances were not able to leave the hospital , which had lost its electricity and was using generator power , he said . \nCoalition jets are using smart bombs to target mechanized forces and mobile surface-to-air missile sites and impede supply lines for their `` beans and bullets , '' Hueber said . \nThe targets include Libya 's premier 32nd Brigade , commanded by one of Gadhafi 's sons and fully engaged in the fighting . \n`` It 's an extremely complex and difficult environment , '' Hueber said about going after forces in populated areas . \nGadhafi : ` We will be victorious ' Santorum : Mission confusion in Libya Obama hopes Libyan rebels will organize Inside bombed Libyan military base `` And our primary focus is to interdict those forces before they enter the city ... cut off their lines of communication and cut off their command and control , '' he said . \n`` There have been no reports of civilian casualties . \nOur mission here is to protect the civilian populace and we choose our targets and plan our actions with that as our top priority . '' \nWednesday night 's outbreak of violence broke a respite that began earlier in the day with the coalition attacks -- the first calm in a week , Misrata residents reported . \n`` We would like to express our gratitude to the international community since there were airstrikes this morning , '' said Mohammed , an opposition spokesman in the city who would identify himself only by his first name . \nGadhafi 's forces had been stationed on the outskirts of the city , where they were providing support and supplies to loyalists fighting rebels in Misrata proper . \nEarlier in the day , grocery stores and other shops opened in the city , which is located two hours east of Tripoli and has been inaccessible to journalists . \nOne person inside the hospital told CNN that five more people were killed in the last 24 hours , raising the death toll to at least 95 in the last seven days . \nA man who died Wednesday morning was shot by a sniper , the person said . \nGen. Abdul Fatah Younis , a former interior minister who quit to lead opposition forces , said rebels have requested weapons from several nations to help the embattled city . \n`` Misrata is destroyed and they need weapons , '' Younis told CNN . \n`` We try to send them weapons , but of course they were all light weapons . \nThere were no heavy weapons . '' \nAsked about the situation in Misrata , Deputy National Security Adviser for Strategic Communications Ben Rhodes said , `` We 're concerned about it , but I think you 're actually seeing some indications that the effort of the coalition is ... focused on Misrata and is having an effect there . '' \nThe rapid advance of Libyan forces had been halted , particularly their move toward the nation 's second-largest city , Benghazi , Rhodes told reporters aboard Air Force One . \nLibya 's elite forces are drawn from tribes loyal to Gadhafi . \nThough they comprise no more than 10,000 men , those forces are on the offense , Hueber said . \n`` Those forces are fully-engaged in this conflict , that are attacking those civilian populations , '' he added . \nThough the rebels are in a better position than they were a few days ago , the Gadhafi forces have the upper edge , a U.S. official said . \nThey remain capable of carrying out attacks on the opposition , are relatively well-organized and continue to fight effectively , the official said . \nRhodes predicted the transition of command and control to another entity would be effected in `` a matter of days . '' \nNATO will likely play a key role in the command and control , he said , adding that he would not describe the conflict as `` an open-ended war , a land invasion in Libya . '' \nThe international airstrikes against Libyan military positions began over the weekend after Gadhafi defied a United Nations-mandated cease-fire in attacks against civilians . \nThe strikes are intended to help establish a no-fly zone . \nSweden announced Wednesday it has frozen more than $ 1.53 billion in Libyan assets in response to EU sanctions imposed on the northern African country . \nFrance launched the air campaign in Libya and Britain and the United States followed . \nGermany is not participating in the military action , though it agrees with the United Nations resolution in principle , and moved Wednesday to ensure that its ships were far removed from the Libyan campaign . \nA German navy spokesman said Wednesday that all German ships previously under NATO command in the Mediterranean Sea were reassigned to operate under national command and are returning to previously scheduled port stops in Europe to await further instructions . \nGerman crew members of NATO fighter jets were also under German command . \nBritain has announced an international meeting for next Tuesday to assess the situation in Libya . \nThe war was sparked in February by protests demanding an end to Gadhafi 's nearly 42-year rule . \nThe Libyan strongman responded with force against civilians , prompting the international community to take action . \nHowever , a Johns Hopkins University professor said the coalition can achieve only so much through aerial strikes . \n`` We have to understand the limits of what air power can do , '' Fouad Ajami told CNN 's `` AC360 . '' \n`` This is a recipe for a stalemate , '' he said . \nCriticism and questions persist about the international campaign , with no clear answer on who will take over command of the mission and what the exit strategy will be . \nU.S. President Barack Obama said the timetable for a transition of military leadership will be coming in days , not weeks . \nNATO said Wednesday it will decide shortly what its role in the operation will be . \nA spokesman added the alliance is well prepared . \n`` This is the bread and butter of NATO , '' an official said . \nFrench Foreign Minister Alain Juppe has voiced his opposition to NATO taking political leadership over the Libya campaign . \nHe suggested that a commission composed of foreign ministers from the participating states play that role . \nAjami , however , said the Arab world would welcome NATO involvement . \n`` They know that the calamity is unfolding in Libya , and they know that no help is going to come other than from the West and from the United States . '' \nBritish Prime Minister David Cameron said Wednesday that Kuwait and Jordan have agreed to provide logistical support to the Libyan effort . \nJordanian government spokesman Taher Edwan told CNN that Jordan 's role will be limited to a humanitarian one . \n`` Jordan did not and will not have any military participation in Libya , neither in planes or on the ground at all in Libya , '' he said . \nQatar has already contributed planes to mission . \nThe United Arab Emirates said Tuesday it will participate -- but only in providing humanitarian assistance . \nToward that end , the country has sent a ship and two planes with basic relief supplies , the country 's news agency said . \nCNN 's Nic Robertson , Ben Brumfield , Jennifer Rizzo , Arwa Damon , Amir Ahmed , Barbara Starr and Diana Magnay contributed to this report \n"}

'' \nHe was talking about the coalition attacks on Moammar Gadhafi 's forces in Libya , why the United States was still in control , why tensions are rising among members of the coalition , why there 's no plan for any group or nation to take the lead . \nThe allies , you see , are n't getting along so well . \nIn fact , there are reports today that the coalition is falling apart . \nFrance yesterday suggested a committee be formed - outside of NATO - to oversee the military operations . \nIt would be a political steering committee and would include members of the Arab League . \nSee if a committee is running the war , no one has to take responsibility if things go to hell and everyone can take credit if they go well . \nThe French were early backers of the no-fly zone and were the first nation to launch airstrikes against Libya on Saturday . \nThe Italians have accused the French of not originally backing a NATO-run operation to be in a better position for oil contracts when a new government is established in Libya . \nIt 's not just the French causing problems Russia 's defense minister yesterday called for a cease-fire in Libya . \nGermany today pulled its naval ships out of NATO operations in the Mediterranean over a disagreement over the Libyan campaign 's direction . \nIt 's not pretty . \nForeign ministers from Western coalition partners will meet in London Tuesday along with members of the Arab League and the African Union to see what can be done . \nHere s my question to you : France wants a committee to run the war in Libya . \nIs that a good idea ? \nInterested to know which ones made it on air ? \nYes , I think it is a good idea . \nHanding command over to Allied forces shows solidarity . \nLet the allies figure this one out for a a change . \nHopefully they will decide to drop a missile on Gadhafi himself so this thing will come to a swift end . \nYou 've got to be kidding . \nA camel is a horse designed by a committee . \nThis won t come out as good . \nWe 've done our part . \nWe should tell the coalition they have 48 hrs to take over and then we 're gone , whether they have something in place or not . \nThis is the first conflict in recent memory where no one has a plan , everyone is passing the buck , no one knows the players and no one knows the end-game . \nAll we know for certain is that we have wasted a vast amount of expensive cruise missiles . \nThe replacement costs are extraordinarily high and this approach depletes our stockpile . \nWhere is the sense in this approach ? \nI 'm all for propping up democracies , supporting freedom and liberty , but where is the plan ? \nJack , how many people have to die before the coalition gets rid of the problem in Libya , whether accidentally or purposely ? \nGadhafi must go , hopefully sooner than later . \nMaje in Vancouver , British Columbia : It 's a great idea if you want to see the Odyssey Dawn crew out-daffy Gadhafi ! \nI can see it all now : Inspector Clouseau draws up the battle plans and Mr. Bean leads Larry , Moe and Curly in the charge . \nAnd the wacky Libyan colonel dies laughing . \nI worked with an American subsidiary of a French company for fifteen years , and this is so typical , not just of the French , but of the Europeans in general . \nThis is a bad , bad , bad idea . \nDefine the objective , put an American in charge , and Get ' r done . \nAs long as we get to move out and let others have control , with little to no involvement , sounds good to me ... committee away ! \nFantastic idea as long as they do n't use assets\\/resources from the United States . \nIts amazing how many good ideas come to light when another country -LRB- s -RRB- is footing the bill . \nThe United Nations is a good example as all of their projects are either partially or fully funded by the west . \nJack : Leadership by committee is not a good idea . \nIts lead , follow , or get the hell out of the way . \nThe military lives and works by a chain of command or commanders to accomplish a common purpose mission . \nThe idea of leadership by committee reminds me of the United States Senate where there are alot of ideas , but little is accomplished . \nThe military needs one action commander not a committee . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 1:46 pm | If the committee is Obama style , a gathering of the best expertise from war departments and State Departments , yes that 's fine , but a la Obama there must be a Chairperson who synthesizes the committee 's determinations . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 1:54 pm | I hope so americans are war sick . \nWe cannt stop every bad guy . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 2:06 pm | I think we should just let France run it , and back out entirely now . \nWe do n't need to get involved in another open-ended costly boondoggle , especially when we do n't know what kind of people we 'd be helping replace Khaddafi . \nThey could be Islamic radicals for all we know . \nIt 's very unlikely they 'll create a Western-style secular democracy , though . \nAnd since Republicans in Congress refuse to raise taxes , I 'd hate to have to explain to Grandma that they 're going to cut her Social Security check to pay for this . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 2:11 pm | Nothing of that magnitude can succeed without an intelligent Committee from all the countries issuing orders . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 2:13 pm | Good for France , but bad for military action . \nI have a better idea , let the French take the lead and see whether they 've learned their lessons from Viet Nam and Algeria . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 2:18 pm | If having a committee run the war in Libya means not putting a western label on the war then it 's a good idea . \nIt is time for the United States to take a backseat . \nWe have already bitten off more than we can chew by being involved in two wars . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 2:22 pm | Yes , that way the US will not have to take all the blame for the action taken . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 2:30 pm | Yes , I think it is a good idea . \nHanding command over to Allied forces shows soloidarity . \nLet the allies figure this one out for a a change . \nHopefully they will decide to drop a missile on Gadafy himself so this thing will come to a swift end . \nSaving more lives , time and money . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 2:33 pm | It 's a great idea if you want to see the Odyssey Dawn crew out-daffy Ghadafi ! \nI can see it all now : Inspector Clouseau draws up the battle plans and Mr. Bean leads Larry , Moe and Curly in the charge . \nAnd the whacky Libyan colonel dies laughing . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 2:37 pm | Committees do not make executive decisions . \nThey debate and debate like the UN , then pass resolutions . \nThis is a baaaad idea . \nNow you know why U.S. leadership is indispensable . \nWithout it , the rest of the world is confused and lost . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 2:37 pm | Oh great -- that is just what we need . \nWe ca n't get things right when we run the war now we need a committee -- let France deal with it . \nThroughout history war conducted by a committee will almost always end in disaster ! \nOne of the principles of war that has been taught since the days of Clausewitz is `` Unity of Command . '' \nOnly ONE person is in charge of a military operation if you want a chance to be successful . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 2:54 pm | What 's next , going to the U.N. to ask permission to raise taxes ?? Worldwide leadership has reached an all time low . \nWashington , Churchill , and Eisenhower must be rolling over in their graves . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 3:02 pm | We do n't need a committe to run the war in libya . \nWe need a committe to end the war in libya , iraq , afghanistan , and pakistan . \nTime to stop the bombings , killings , and assasinations of people in other countries we do n't like . \nThe entire defense and supplemental war budget is borrowed money . \nGaddafi blew up one plane , the u.s. has blow up thousands of planes , and buildings . \nThe u.s. military killed a million people in iraq , nuked hundreds of thousands of japanese civilians with 2 nuclear bombs and yet we have the nerve to call gadaffi a mad man . \nThe rebels in libya drew first blood so it is their mess to clean up not some french fry committee . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 3:03 pm | John Moore - New Britain , PA It is well proven that a committee can not run anything . \nJust as there can only be one chef -LRB- french for chief -RRB- in the kitchen there has to be a visible leader for this Libyan campaign . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 3:07 pm | Good idea as long it is not the U.S. leading , late France and the U.K. lead it is there OIL ! \nIt does n't matter , a committe or take turns , it should be an easy mission that does not take a rocket scientist to figure a strategy to check Khadafy . \nIts seems like its only the people out for a political game thats trying to muddy the waters . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 3:13 pm | Committee to do what ? \nThe only thing that needs to be done is to Remove the tyrant from office Dead or Alive ! \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 3:19 pm | I can just imagine what a guy like General George Patton would think of an idea like that : A committee Jack , A COMMITTEE - Not on your life . \nIf a committee had been running the war in Europe 67 years ago , Paris would still be in Nazi hands and the French would be speaking German . \nNo wonder France has n't won a war in over a hundred years . \nCould France also have a commitee run a war in Ruwanda , Darfur , Congo , Uganda , Ethiopia , Somalia , Zimbabwe , Togo , Burundi , Liberia , Botswana , Colombia , Afghanistan , Palestine , after all they civilian massacres everyday ... , ah , maybe they dont have that much Oil to share with France , does really France care about Libyan civilians ? \nMike from NYC March 23 , 2011 at 3:31 pm | Of course it 's a good idea . \nNATO has worked together for more than a half century . \nThere are decent and capable people in every chair . \nLet the America Firsters go to work building a wall around the country and begin on the part that extends westward from Southern California to surround Hawaii . \nI 'll buy the scuba gear , but no air tanks . \nFrance wants a committee to run the war in Libya . \nIs that a good idea ? \nSounds to me like France just expected the US to take the lead and they were sadly mistaken . \nSo instead of taking the lead they pass it off on others . \nSo typical , no one wants to take responsibility for anything these days . \nThe only one who laid it out as it is was President Obama , . \nHe told the world that this was not our `` war '' that we were only in a supporting role and would not take the lead . \nI believe we just let France run the entire war and bring all of our troops home . \nThis entire issue is just another way to stimulate the economy and take peoples mind off of the real issues in America , jobs and education . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 3:38 pm | Cliff Glass - Rego Park , New York What a novel concept . \nAllies equally sharing cost , risk , and responsibility for a global military action . \nNeocons , take cover , American exceptionalism is definitely under attack . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 3:53 pm | If you want to see the results of committee rule look at the U.N. Security Council . \nIf that does n't scare you check out the NATO Council of Ministers . \nBoth are great examples of cowardice and ineptitude . \nIf there is a concil running the show I hope we pull out completely . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 3:56 pm | As long as we get to move out and let others have control , with little to no involvement , sounds good to me ... committee away ! \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 3:59 pm | Excuse my confusion , Jack , but are we , along with France et al , `` at war '' with Libya ? \nDid I miss the declaration of war on Libya by Congress and Obama ? \nIf indeed we are in another Mid-East war , then we should not be debating who should `` run '' the war and quickly and completely crush the Libyan army and its commander in chief , Gadhafi without debate or hesitation . \nEither we are at war or we are not . \nTo play politics with our troops , Libya 's people without total commitment is a crime in itself . \nEither commit to war and victory or get the hell out . \nGadhafi and his army should have been history by now if we were committed to doing so . \nAre we indeed at war with Libya , Jack ? \nIf you want an issue to be killed , all you have to do is assign it to a committee . \nThey will kick it around until it changes shape so bad that you ca n't recognize the original issue . \nMost committees ca n't control themselve let along assignments\\/issues assigned to them . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 4:04 pm | We have plenty of committees in this country and they ca n't get anything done efficiently . \nSo yeah running a war in Libya by committee should be great . \nCan only imagine how messy this will be in a couple months . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 4:05 pm | Joe Ft Walton Bch Fl It is a very good idea , if they all decide to take him down . \nGaddafi got to go now , if not what have we accomplish . ? \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 4:08 pm | Why not what a great idea work as a team something the USA lost long ago by the outsource idea that now seems to have been to optimistic to say the least . \nAny large project should work as a committee otherwise known as a team . \nI think the `` team '' should go for it . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 4:13 pm | Skarkosy wanted this thing to increase his political clout in an upcoming election . \nIf he wants to cash in on the glory , he should do the heavy lifting . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 4:22 pm | Only if the committee does not include us let the rest of the world handle Libya . \nWe have no real interest there but France does , so let them do the heavy lifting for once . \nI m tired of fighting everyone else s battles for them . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 4:26 pm | Dee in New Paris Ohio Do you mean that France wants the U.S. to commit to helping them run the war in Libya ? \nOr do you mean that FRANCE wants to commit to running the war but wants all the other nations that signed on o commit ? \nAnyway , what I want to know is , between France , the U.S. , and all the other U.N. nations who are willing to help get rid of Gadhafi , what 's the holdup ? \nHow can it be that Libya has not already been conquered and the despot got rid of ? \nIt does not give one a lot of confidence in the ability of the allies if between them they have not accomplished their goal . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 4:28 pm | What doesFrance want ? \nA committe of Western coalisions , a committe of Arab c ountries , or a combination of those ? \nWe are already talking about war . \nWhere it is going to end is every ones guess . \nThe only solution , of course , would be to catch the dictator , a sly and cruel fox , and cookoo to boot . \nThe International court will be impatiently waiting to get its hands on the man . \nThe U.N contract ONLY has issued the R2P -LRB- Resolution to Protect -RRB- Even that may prove extremely difficult to do without `` collateral damage '' . \nI have a feeling that the President has been co-erced in taking a military roll in this adventure . \nThe U.S.A. should have stayed OUT of it , lest it will later be pilloried by the Arabs who found some fault in the countries engament . \n, something THEY should have wanting to tackle . \nUnfortunately they dislike each other more than anybody else . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 4:37 pm | What war or even what military action was ever successfully commanded by a committee ? \nWhat is needed is another Eisenhower . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 4:39 pm | A war run by committee ? \nIf people think the `` plan '' is cockeyed now , give the `` committee '' a chance . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 4:53 pm | Well , since the only person from the United States who has demonstrated ANY leadership whatsoever during this war is President , Hillary Clinton , perhaps a `` committe '' is the solution to this whole mess ! \nI wonder , which community organizer suggested the creation of a committie ? \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 4:58 pm | This kind of stuff is the reason you have your ducks in a row before you act . \nBut no , a committee is a terrible idea . \nYou ever want to see how effective committees are , take a look at any government . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 4:59 pm | Looks like we have a `` food fight '' going on in Europe . \nForming a commitee-sounds like our Congress in action . \nGadhafi is probably laughing inside his bunker . \nMeanwhile Russia and China are sounding `` high and mighty . '' \nIf this is the `` new world order '' , I do n't think I want to be part of it . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 5:01 pm | Well , why not ! \nwar is a business , kind of like congress is . \nWhy not run it like one ? \nWe can have committees , subcommittees , committee chairpersons , secretaries who secretly run things , vice-president of important stuff , keeper of the keys , bullet managers ... well , you get my drift ! \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 5:08 pm | Yes , it is a wonderful idea . \nThe United States has proven its bravery , courage , and resolve time and time again . \nWe have nothing left to prove . \nIt makes since both financially and politically . \nFinancially , it is time other countries help foot the bill when we are called on to stop a dictator from mass murdering his own people . \nPolitically , it lets the world know we are not the only ones sick and tired of these murderous thugs committing genocide . \nWe do n't need any more PR . \nAs Ann Landers used to say , `` it is better to keep your mouth shut and be thought a fool than to open it and prove it . '' \nAbsolutely !! Hold a meeting , form a committee , anything to make it look like someone is doing something to justify transferring money from the taxpayers into corporate coffers . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 5:13 pm | Fabulous idea . \nLet France do it for a change . \nTime for America to stay out of other countries that hate us anyway . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 5:16 pm | Yes , it is a wonderful idea . \nThe United States has proven its bravery , courage , and resolve time and time again . \nWe have nothing left to prove . \nIt makes since both financially and politically . \nFinancially , it is time other countries help foot the bill when we are called on to stop a dictator from mass murdering his own people . \nPolitically , it lets the world know we are not the only ones sick and tired of these murderous thugs committing genocide . \nWe do n't need any more PR . \nAs Ann Landers used to say , `` it is better to keep your mouth shut and be thought a fool than to open it and prove it . '' \nP.S. I also like Wolf 's idea of withholding Lybian funds to pay for our involvement in this fray . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 5:16 pm | Sure . \nFrance has such an outstanding record in military actions in the past couple of centuries . \nLet 's listen to them on matters military . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 5:19 pm | Rather than a `` committee '' how about a bureau ? \nWe can call it the `` Bureau of Misplaced Priorities . '' \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 5:19 pm | It is a great idea . \nThis operation would n't have begun without France and the French have the most interest in Libya . \nUS has little interest in being involved and it gives them an easy exit strategy to let others lead . \nIf France wants to take the ball , let them have it . \nNo one else does . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | of course its not !!! the military although it may defend democracy is not one itself . \nthere are decisions which must be made immediately and you just cant do that with a fractured committee . \npeoples lives depend on quick action and ive never seen a committee that was able to do that . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | I think it is a good Idea since the US does n't have it 's house in order , maybe some other country will do a better job . \nMaybe a country that is n't into debt `` clear up to it 's eyeballs '' would be a good choice for the leadership role . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | Yes Jack By all means put the French in charge . \nThey have a long history of surrenders and defeats . \nIn no time at all The Colonel will be drinking French wine while his body guards shop in Paris . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | I dont know if that would work . \nWe seem to be close to pulling out and the French are becoming . . \nwell , the French to be honest . \nWhy would Russia even speak out about this ? \nThey abstained from the vote when they could have voted against it . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | If France suggested it , I would be against it automatically . \nWhen did France ever do anything that smelled anything like success , since Napoleon 's time , as far as war efforts are concerned ? \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 5:21 pm | Yes . \nThis committee is called the United Nations and I am grateful that America is now supporting the vision of a strong United Nations . \nPlease stop over-analyzing this no-fly zone , the immediate purpose is to save Libyan citizens from being slaughtered by a dictator . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 5:21 pm | Sure Jack , a committee sounds like a wonderful idea . \nLet 's put a committee in charge where people can talk for days and no actual action be taken . \nThere 's a reason why the military does n't use committees . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 5:21 pm | Remo , from beautiful downtown Pflugerville Texas Jack , you 've got to wacth the French , they 'll want to surrender to Libya next . \nWell that has been their history . \nWe should n't have stuck our necks in there in the first place . \nAnd we are there in an illegal manner . \nFor a president who `` boasts doing thing right '' , he sure as hell tends to do the opposite . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 5:21 pm | How French ! \nNo wonder they have n't won a war in forever . \nSomeone has to be in charge -- whether in the newsroom or the battlefield . \n-LRB- I 'm a retired US Military officer who studied at the French Army Staff School in France and worked at our Embassy in Paris . \nI can assure you this is a ` political ' statement and did not originate from French Military officers . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 5:21 pm | Wow ! \nI worked with an American subsidiary of a French company for fifteen years , and this is so typical , not just of the French , but of the Europeans in general . \nThis is a bad , bad , bad idea . \nDefine the objective , put an American in charge , and Get ' r done . \nA Committee !!!!!!!! You 've got to be kidding . \nA camel is a horse designed by a committee . \nThis won come out as good . \nWe 've done our part . \nWe should tell the coalition they have 48 hrs to take over and then we 're gone , whether they have somthing in place or not was n't it the Frech who we bailed out in WWI ? \nWas n't it the French who insisted on the war reparations that set up Hitler 's rise to power ? \nWas n't it the French -LRB- Le Grand Charles -RRB- who were angry that we prevented new war reparations after WWII ? \nThen there was Dien Bein Phou . \nObama better read some history and take charge ! \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 5:23 pm | Absolutely . \nThe question is , is the US going in as a bully oil mogul\\/occupier or to help democratically minded people set up a democracy . \nIt 's best if we sit equally at the table with everyone else and abide by the opinion of consensus . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 5:23 pm | This sandbox is the result of a President who has ZERO military experience . \nCome on folks -- when are we going to start requiring prior military service for the Office of Presidency ? \nIt 's just common sense . \nThen again , we have n't seen much of that in quite some time now from any party ... March 23 , 2011 at 5:23 pm | Let 's form a committee of intelligent military men and put Hillary Clinton in charge of all . \nShe seems to be the only one in office that is where she 's supposed to be . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 5:23 pm | It 's ok with me , Jack - as long as the US is not on the committee and we get the heck out of Libya and the other places we do n't belong . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 5:23 pm | A committee o run this `` war '' in Libya would be a fantastic idea , as long as the United States does n't try and run it . \nIts about time that someone else step up to the challenge of trying to be World Peace Keeper ! \nBut if they need the muscle the US wont be too far behind ! \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 5:25 pm | CNN Jack Cafferty : France wants committee to run war in Libya . \nJct : Under Khadafi , Libyans were burdened with no taxes , free health care , free education at home and abroad , lots to be rebelling against . \nI have no doubt the Committee will be able to `` raise '' them to the same standard of living as in the US . \nHar har har har har . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 5:25 pm | Here we go again . \nI remember we went into Vietnam to help the French and once we did that , they promptly backed out leaving the US holding the proverbial bag Remember , history does repeat itself . \nFirst the UAE is MIA , now the collation is fracturing apart . \nSo do we enter war # 4 ??? A no fly zone will Not oust Qaddafi from power . \nQaddafi s ground forces are superior to the poorly equipped freedom-fighters which means there will ultimately be boots on the ground and now the question would be whose boots ? \nWhich country will ultimately send in ground troops ? \nI vote NO American ground Military ! \nEnough is enough !! March 23 , 2011 at 5:25 pm | Jack , excluding every previous committee ever set up , how many have failed ? \nThe very idea a bunch of French bureaucrats can win a war is absurd . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 5:25 pm | If it 's a committee , how about calling it a `` C.R.I.M.E. '' - Committee Rationalizing Infiltrating Moammar 's Empire . \nFirst , why did we let the French pull our strings ? \nWhat have we ever learned from the French , accept how to lose ? \nNATO has to step forward and take the lead regardless of what others say . \nThe Arab leagues that supported this U. N. resolution , needs to put up or shut up . \nThey are just to worried about the backlash , but really do not want to defend the freedom that all humans seek . \nNATO has a chain of command , they need to use it , that is why we have NATO . \nPeople are dieing while the world including the U.S plays in politics . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 5:26 pm | Sounds like France has never read `` The Art of War '' by Sun Tzu . \nOne leader at the top -LRB- with advisors , but one leader is the only effective way to approach conflict . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 5:26 pm | French is in favor of running everything with commitees . \nWhich is excellent way of screwing a war effort beswides anything else . \nReminds me of a joke : What is a Camel ? \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 5:26 pm | Establishing a committee shows how disorganised this coalition forces are . \nA no-fly zone headed by a committe , will have no effect . \nGadaffi stands a good chance of winning this battle because he has shown leadership , and those trying to remove him , lack a clear vision . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 5:27 pm | Regarding the recommendation for a committee to run the war . \nIt should be a select group of Senators and Reps. My reason for suggesting this is that it would cost billions of dollars , take forever and six months , the war would be over by then which is okay since any plan these dolts come up with would n't work anyway March 23 , 2011 at 5:27 pm | Look at how politicians are running our government and then try to convience me that committee members from different nations can run a war like campaign . \nMoammar Gadhafi would probably die of old age before a committee would come to a concensus on the campaing . \nYou know how politicians work together . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 5:27 pm | No a good idea . \nPresident `` George W. '' Sarkozy of France is having a problem with re-election next year . \nHe is trying to prop up his approval rating in France by being a cowboy . \nWhy should we engage in a civil war in Libya ? \nUnlike Sadam , Gadafy is a appeaser of the West . \nShould we pull him down and replace by an Islamic alternative government , an Islam Republic of Libya ? \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 5:27 pm | It has been said that a horse is a camel built by committee . \nSuddenly the GOP wants answers about military actions ; funny they were n't so curious when furious George B. went to war because of his beliefs and false rumors . \nWe need to finish the job and take Gadafhi out ! \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 5:28 pm | No one to blame if things go wrong . \nNo one is responsible if things go right . \nSounds like a win -- win to me ! \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 5:28 pm | No. . \nThe U.N. has had more than a half century worth of experience dealing with these kind of problems . \nWill the committee handle the financing , logistics and take responsibility for civilian or other losses ? \nWe have started a humanitarian effort to help the people in Libya as well as try to settle the unrest in the area to try and quell the speculators desire to raise oil prices . \nWhich is in the U.S. 's and worlds best interest . \nThis is a civil war in Libya . \nWe have leveled the playing field and now it is up to the Libyans and their neighbors to fight for their Democracy and change ... March 23 , 2011 at 5:28 pm | If the `` politicians would turn over the war to the warriors like Pres. Bush did in the first gulf war , this one would be over with by now . \nPolitics do n't win wars , they just prolong them March 23 , 2011 at 5:28 pm | It 's just another attempt by France to be politically safe at all costs . \nI ca n't remember the last time France had a `` good '' idea . \nIt was France 's idea to warn Ghadafi when the U.S. tried to cut the head off of this snake more than 20 years ago . \nWe should push France out of the equation altogether , since they have protected him in the past , and hand leadership to a country that has the least to gain from the whole situation , This would attempt to gain some form of political neutrality in the military decision making . \nPolitical and military decision making never go well together . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 5:28 pm | No , this was France 's idea in the beginning . \nIt was politicking all around . \nFrance just wants oil as usual and they will benefit from this the most this is why they convinced Hillary to convince obama to say yes to this crap . \nNo one should ever trust the French when it comes to wars , did n't they abandon us in iraq when they realized people would die ? \nThe French are only good at retreating . . \npunks the whole lot ! \nAlso CNN stop telling Obama\\/what to do and outlining his agenda for him he is a grown man he knows what he is about . \nHe talked to congressional leaders and now the tan man is having selective amnesia about it . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 5:28 pm | A committee is always a good idea because a smaller group can accomplish more by coming into agreement quicker . \nIf we get all countries on board with a committee then tensions will ease because everyone will feel like they are part of the oversight of this endeavor . \nThis is new , but if other countries contribute resources then its a good thing . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 5:28 pm | Absolutely a good idea . \nI love my country and respect the presidency , but this jerk and the last jerk attacked countries who did n't first attack us . \nWe are supposed to believe in democracy , but it is not democratic to believe you can speak for other countries . \nPlus Obama needs to be more thoughtful of the American people whom he 's helping Bush bankrupt . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 5:28 pm | Nurse Lisa in Shelton CT Sure France -- compile a committee . \nHoping the US will not be on the committee nor footing any part of the financial burden of their efforts . \nWas mad about last weeks magical announcement about Daffy 's involvement in terrorist activities of the past -- like we did n't have this intel for yrs . \nThe public never gets the truth , just the bills . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 5:29 pm | Since everyone seems to think having Arab backing is needed , then I do n't see a better approach than the committee . \nIf we had consulted with Congress before deploying the no-fly zone then we would not have needed the committee because the opposition forces would all be dead by now . \nThere is a reason why the President is the Commander-in-Chief and not the Congress . \nSo , France wants a committee to run the war in Libya . \nMy only concern is that the US Congress might be involved in some way , shape or form . \nIf that happens ... all is lost . \nIf those bickering boneheads can be sidestepped ... hey , we just might see something work for a change . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 5:31 pm | Everything is a bad idea , Jack . \nThere are no solutions . \nThey need dictators to function . \nThey know no other way . \nBut , where was Speaker Boehner -LRB- or however you spell his name -RRB- when the U.S. basically unilaterally launched a full scale war and occupation to follow on a country that did n't have anything to with anything ? \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 5:31 pm | That is not an excellent idea . \nWe already have too many organizations . \nIt will just lead to the already economic problems we face in this world today . \nWe will see more bloodshed in this world . \nWhy are we not making more organizations for world peace ? \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 5:33 pm | Why does Committee almost rhyme with dither . \nCommitte also means that US forces will be commanded by nations that do n't care to much for us-The French among the others in the EU . \nI usually support Obama , yet this time he is foolish in not wanting to appear imperialistic . \nThe timid cringe and make deals ; those that `` CAN DO '' make the rules and lead their lessers . \nThe US is the only democracy in the coalition . \nOnly the US has a First Amendment . \nSo we also `` KNOW HOW '' . \nfn : US troops were under the UN command in Somalia ; That turned out really good ! \nJack , we should n't be there at all ! \nWe keep removing dictaters from power and destablizing the region I only want their Oil . \nI do n't care about them at all . \nJack From Nice , Ca . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 5:34 pm | If the strategy is anything other than get in , destroy all Libyan air forces and military vehicles where civilians are being slaughtered , and get out , then the coalition should disband . \nFor people to even think about who gets oil from Libya at a time like this is beyond disgusting . \nI hate high gas prices , but I also ca n't stand those who look to profit because of others ' suffering . \nAre they actually thinking , these women and children are being slaughtered , but hey , at least I can make a few million dollars by getting first dibs on their oil ? \nIf so , then we need to come up with a vaccine to protect the world from such ignorance . \nGhadafi could be killed at any time with special forces , so no military action is needed to unseat him . \nGhadafi is over confident and seems to think that he is immortal . \nHe is a perfect target . \nHe will soon realize that he is a spec and that his legacy is worthless . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 5:35 pm | A committee ???? What is this ? \nMaybe it 's a good idea . \nWe could abstain from every motion put forward . \nWhat happens if we do n't have a quorum ? \nThey say that it was a committee that created the camel when they were trying to create a horse . \n` nuff said March 23 , 2011 at 5:35 pm | Committee ? \nYour kidding me more . \nI am surprised they have not surrendered to Libya yet ... Someone is always in charge of a committee . \nSo who chairs the committee ? \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 5:36 pm | Absolutely a good idea . \nI love my country and respect the presidency , but this and the last president attacked countries who did n't attack us . \nWe are supposed to believe in democracy , but it is not democratic to believe you can speak for other countries . \nPlus Obama needs to be more thoughtful of the American people whom he 's helping Bush bankrupt . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 5:37 pm | When you say , `` It 's not just the French causing problems ... '' and then you state `` Russia 's defense minister yesterday called for a cease-fire in Libya , '' are you stating that steps towards peace only cause problems ? \nHow is a cease-fire a bad thing ? \nIs this what a committee is needed to discuss , what is a peaceful move and a war-mongering move ? \nAlso , with Germany not agreeing with the way Libya is being handled , how are they causing trouble by protecting their citizens and military by not involving them in a dispute that they have nothing to do with ? \nDid Libya do anything to Germany ? \nI have n't seen anything to hint this . \nDid Libya do anything to the U.S. ? \nI have n't heard anything to hint this either . \nAlliances only drag countries into conflicts in which they had nothing to do with originally . \n`` Peace , commerce , and honest friendship with all nations -- entangling alliances with none . '' \n~ Thomas Jefferson But why would we want peace , commerce , and honest friendship ? \nWe would n't have any real reasons to go kill and flex our military muscle then , because that solves everything all the time . \nSo , no , a committee to run the `` war '' in Libya is a bad idea , just like it was stated , '' ... if a committee is running the war , no one has to take responsibility if things go to hell and everyone can take credit if they go well . '' \nWe should know this already by the countless committees in our own Congress and how no one jumps at the opportunity to take responsibility when things go wrong . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 5:37 pm | Oh good . \nI 'll hold my breath waiting for that to work out well for everyone concerned . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 5:37 pm | A committee has to have a leader and hopefully parties who desire to work together a for a common goal . \nTHis bunch ca n't agree on anything for more than a day or two ? \nWe did our part , now either go get Gadaffi without all the baloney from these other clowns or lets go home ? \nWe have paid the bulk of this so far and Europe are the one 's who really need this mess cleaned up . \nGeez , is our leadership dumb otr what I think ignoring too many other of our own problems while trying to conceal our very serious financial issues to the rest of the world by appearing strong is laughable . \nSounds like another money laundering scandal in the making . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 5:39 pm | France and England wanted to get Gaddaffi and did a lot of tough talk b\\/4 this started . \nWhy do n't they put their troops in there for a clean up and bring this to a close ? \nWe have done enough I think . \nFrance needs some kind of leadership or steering committee when it comes to military action , but not us . \nUsually they need someone to fight for them since their rifles have all been dropped a time or two . \nWe have the green light now so use it , and let the US make Kadafi want to join the French Foriegn Legion . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 5:43 pm | I have experienced `` decisions '' by committee . \nListen to the upside , downside , likes , dislikes blah blah blah . \nAt the end of the meeting , I make the call . \nLet the French discuss it into the ground . \nI say drop a 2000 pounder on Kadafi and lets , the USA , call it game over . \nThen we can debate that for years . \nPoop or get off the pot ! \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 5:44 pm | Barbara Teixeira - Las Vegas , NV A Committee ? \nAnd next they will argue about who should be the chairman ! \nAre there no leaders in this world ? \nHow about one leader who knows what the heck he -LRB- or she -RRB- is doing ? \nMaybe we should let Hillary run the show . \nIf this is what is going on concerning this mess in Libya , then how about the US pulls out of the `` committee '' . \nWe do n't need to have our fingerprints on everything . \nAnd especially not this mess . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 5:48 pm | Yes , I think that a NATO-led committee should run the war in Libya and hopefully the U.S. stays out of the affair altogether . \nLet the U.N. assume the control and the expense of this operation . \nWe already have enough to deal with in terms of military occupations and do not need to assume full responsibility by occupying a third arab country . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 5:52 pm | Why not ? \nWe have hearings on all manner of things . \nThis is a compelling issue which should be discussed . \nWe know too little about the Middle East and Islam : and apparently US government if we are to beleive that sad poll of earlier in the week . \nMarch 23 , 2011 at 5:59 pm | Jack Cafferty sounds off hourly on the Situation Room on the stories crossing his radar . \nNow , you can check in with Jack online to see what he 's thinking and weigh in with your own comments online and on TV . \nWould you ride in a car that drives itself ? \nIs she the answer ? \nShould the #LoneStarState be allowed to withdraw from U.S. ? \n"}
{"id": "81", "time": "2011-03-23", "text": "By Paul Cruickshank and Tim Lister , CNN Libyan youths walk past a burnt out building in this file picture in the eastern Libyan town of Derna on February 23 , 2011 . \nA former Libyan jihadist says al Qaeda will seek to take advantage of chaos in Libya Diplomats and analysts ask whether unrest might provide an opening for al Qaeda There is a long history of Islamist radicalization in Libya Especially in the impoverished , restive eastern provinces -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The town of Derna is not much to look at -- a heap of Soviet-style concrete buildings in a deprived and windswept corner of eastern Libya . \nBut it has a rich history -- fought over and colonized since Roman times -- and a stunning location on the Mediterranean . \nIt has also gained a reputation as a hotbed of jihadists . \nAnd that has diplomats and analysts asking whether the unrest in Libya might provide an opening for al Qaeda and fellow travelers , just a short hop from Europe . \nDerna even made it into U.S. diplomatic cables obtained by Wikileaks . \nA cable from 2008 describes it as a `` wellspring of Libyan foreign fighters '' for al Qaeda in Iraq . \nHigh youth unemployment , discrimination by the Gadhafi regime and the influence of veteran Libyan jihadists from Afghanistan all played a role in radicalizing a new generation . \n`` Other factors include a dearth of social outlets for young people , -LRB- and -RRB- local pride in Derna 's history as a locus of fierce opposition to occupation , '' the cable said . \n`` Most young men watched a mix of al-Jazeera news , religious sermons and western action films on English language satellite channels broadcast from the Gulf . \nThe result was a heady mixture of violence , religious conservatism and hatred of U.S. policy in Iraq and Palestine . '' \nPresident Obama 's plan on Libya Obama on Libya : We have saved lives Gadhafi : ` We will be victorious ' Today , Derna is very much in the opposition 's hands , and accounts from eastern Libya say Islamists and others are fighting side-by-side with one aim : removing Moammar Gadhafi . \nBut what comes next ? \nGadhafi has been quick to raise the specter of al Qaeda as the beneficiary of unrest in Libya , even claiming that it was drugging young Libyans into opposing his rule . \nThe regime has also paraded a former member of the Libyan Islamist Fighting Group who had allegedly been `` captured '' during fighting in Zawiyah . \nWhile the regime 's claims may seem outlandish , a former leader of Libyan jihadists tells CNN that al Qaeda will seek to take advantage of chaos in Libya . \n`` If there is a power vacuum in Libya there will be an open market for al Qaeda , '' says Noman Benotman , a former commander in the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group and one-time ally of Osama bin Laden . \nThe LIFG fought the Gadhafi regime in the 1990s , but formally ended its campaign to overthrow the Libyan regime two years ago , and repudiated al Qaeda . \nBenotman is now a senior researcher at the Quilliam Foundation in London , a counter-terrorism think tank . \nHaving played no role in the rebellion so far , al Qaeda and its affiliates will have to play catch-up if they do want to exploit the situation , says Benotman . \nIndividuals who might have jihadist sympathies are keeping them under wraps for the sake of uniting with one aim : removing Gadhafi , he says . \nAdded to which there has been a broad welcome among Libyan rebels of all stripes for U.S. and coalition airstrikes to protect the city of Benghazi . \nAccording to Benotman , dozens of former LIFG fighters have now joined rebel efforts to topple Gadhafi , but he stressed that they had done so in a personal capacity rather than organizing operations as a group . \nProtest movements across the Middle East -- predominantly secular and pro-democracy -- have so far reduced the jihadist message to irrelevance . \nBut Benotman sees potentially dangerous parallels in Libya with neighboring Algeria and with Afghanistan . \nAfter the Soviet withdrawal in 1989 , the West walked away from Afghanistan rather than use its `` soft power '' to bring about positive change , he says . \nThe Taliban eventually filled the void . \nAs a young jihadist , Benotman was there to witness it . \nFighter jet crash : What happened Preparing for battle in Libya And in Algeria , a 1992 army coup following electoral gains by radical Islamist parties spawned a violent insurgency . \nMore than 100,000 Algerians were killed in a savage conflict between the state and Islamist extremists before the insurgency waned in the mid-1990s . \nSome Western counter-terrorism officials fret that a prolonged civil war in Libya could open up space for al Qaeda . \nGovernments and NGOs have to be quick , says Benotman , in helping rebel-held areas develop education , health-care and the institutions of democracy . \nLibya -- like Yemen -- has a less developed `` civil society '' than either Egypt or Tunisia after 40 years of authoritarian rule . \nIt also has entrenched tribal rivalries and a small middle class . \nSuch conditions were compounded by Gadhafi 's strategy of divide and rule through a baffling array of competing power centers . \nAl Qaeda has already scented an opportunity . \nIts leading ideologue , Abu Yahya al-Libi -- himself a Libyan -- told Islamists in the country : `` Store your weapons and do not relinquish them . '' \nIn an audio tape released on March 12 , he said that `` ousting these regimes is not the end in making a change . '' \nA week later the leader of al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb -LRB- AQIM -RRB- had a similar message . \nIn an audiotape posted on Jihadist websites and translated by the SITE Intelligence Group , Abu Musab Wadud told Gadhafi 's opponents : `` We will be side-by-side with you , Allah willing . '' \nUntil now , That may be wishful thinking . \nAQIM has in recent times been restricted to remote parts of Mali , Niger and Mauritania and has suffered leadership splits . \nWadud may also have damaged his cause by predicting the United States and NATO would never help the rebels because they were the `` source of the disaster . '' \nBut al Qaeda is nothing if not persistent . \nAnd there is a long history of Islamist radicalization in Libya , especially in the impoverished , restive eastern provinces . \nAt the peak of the Iraqi insurgency , more jihadists per capita traveled to join al Qaeda in Iraq from Libya than from any other country . \nAnd according to al Qaeda records seized by the U.S. Army in Iraq , in 2006-07 more volunteers -- a total of 53 -- traveled to Iraq from Derna than any other city in the Arab world . \nAnd in the 1990s , Benotman 's group had tried to establish a safe haven in Derna , eventually being bombed into submission by the Libyan air force . \nWhich brings us back to the U.S. cable from 2008 , in which an American diplomat who traveled to Derna , quoted a local businessman who had `` likened young men in Derna to Bruce Willis ' character in the action picture ` Die Hard , ' who stubbornly refused to die quietly . \nFor them , resistance against coalition forces in Iraq is an important act of ` jihad ' and a last act of defiance against the Gadhafi regime . '' \n`` It 's jihad -- it 's our duty , and you 're talking about people who do n't have much else to be proud of , '' he said . \nMaybe that at last is changing . \n"}
{"id": "241", "time": "2011-03-23", "text": "By John P. Avlon , CNN Contributor John Avlon : Voices are being raised against Obama 's action against Libya He says many are coming from the left , not the right Some liberals are very unhappy with Obama 's continuation of some Bush policies , he says Avlon : Obama is making policy based on reality , not ideology Editor 's note : John Avlon is a CNN contributor and senior political columnist for The Daily Beast . \nHe is the author of `` Wingnuts : How the Lunatic Fringe Is Hijacking America . '' \nNew York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It 's dj vu all over again . \nCongressman Dennis Kucinich is talking impeachment . \nRalph Nader is grumbling that the president of the United States is a `` war criminal . '' \nMichael Moore is venting his spleen on the subject of U.S. hypocrisy . \nWhat 's different is that the president provoking the professional protest crowd this time is a Democrat . \nFor all the overheated anger at President Obama from the far right , where people have called him a socialist and worse , the fact is that Obama is n't considered a ideological soul mate by the far left . \nOne of the reasons : Libya is just the latest example of Obama embracing national security executive powers that have prompted some liberals to claim that he is leading George W. Bush 's third term . \nFirst , there was the decision to increase the number of troops in Afghanistan . \nThen came the realization that closing Guantanamo was easier said than done . \nThere is the administration 's use of wiretaps and escalation of predator drone strikes . \nAnd now the airstrikes in Libya , engaged without extensively consulting Congress . \nWar power policy in question An objective assessment of the Obama record on foreign policy shows that he has not been the soft liberal ideologue that conservatives want to run against . \nAn excellent book by my Daily Beast colleague Stephen Carter , `` The Violence of Peace , '' analyzes Obama 's War Doctrine at length from a legal , but readable , perspective . \nCarter writes , `` On matters of national security , at least , the Oval Office evidently changes the outlook of its occupant far more than the occupant changes the outlook of the Oval Office . '' \nWhile Obama has changed the unilateral style of the Bush administration , he 's kept much of the substance . \nHe has drawn down troops in Iraq , as promised . \nBut on many other fronts , he has found that campaign rhetoric often does not square with the responsibilities of governing . \nBecause many on the left define themselves in opposition to authority , they are historically quick to turn on presidents of their own party for being insufficiently liberal -- whether it is Truman 's and Kennedy 's Cold Warrior enthusiasm , LBJ 's escalation of the Vietnam War , Jimmy Carter 's budget cuts or Bill Clinton 's welfare reform . \nKucinich has been joined by a small chorus of voices from the left in Congress in condemning the president . \nThese include : Barbara Lee -LRB- who was the lone vote against the Afghanistan invasion after 9\\/11 -RRB- ; Michael Capuano -LRB- last seen telling a union rally `` you need to get out on the streets and get a little bloody '' -RRB- ; Maxine Waters -LRB- who repeatedly pulled a proto-Joe Wilson by calling President Bush a `` liar '' -RRB- and Sheila Jackson Lee -LRB- a House Foreign Affairs committee member who last year said `` Today we have two Vietnams , side by side , North and South '' -RRB- . \nThis cast of characters is a fair representation of the far left in the minds of the right . \nAnd yet they are now among Obama 's fiercest critics . \nThat should be a reality check that resonates with centrist and independent voters . \nBut you 've got to give Obama 's critics on the left points for ideological consistency . \nThey are apparently not swayed by simple partisanship . \nSome of their newfound allies on the right , however , will have a harder time making that case . \nFor example , former House Speaker Newt Gingrich , a potential Republican presidential candidate , took aim at the Libya intervention , calling it `` opportunistic amateurism without planning or professionalism . '' \nA few days earlier , as Alana Goodman pointed out in Commentary , he had been criticizing Obama 's inaction , saying , `` This is a moment to get rid of -LRB- Gadhafi -RRB- . \nGet it over with . '' \nLibertarian , and longtime critic of the neo-cons , Ron Paul can at least claim consistency in his circulation of a congressional resolution `` expressing the sense of Congress that the President is required to obtain in advance specific statutory authorization for the use of United States Armed Forces in response to civil unrest in Libya . '' \nAmong its supporters to date is Detroit Democrat John Conyers -- Ron Paul 's philosophic opposite on almost everything . \nThe Beltway buzz was that committed partisans finally found something upon which they could agree . \nObama can be criticized for delay in his decision to impose a no-fly zone . \nHe can be criticized for communicating more with allies in advance of multilateral action than with members of Congress . \nHe can be criticized for lack of military experience before entering office and insufficiently clear directives after . \nBut the secret hiding in plain sight is that Barack Obama was never the simple `` anti-war candidate '' his leftist supporters hoped or his conservative opponents feared . \nWhile he opposed Iraq from the beginning , he supported escalation in Afghanistan , even proposing drone strikes into Pakistan during the campaign . \nThe criticism of the professional left and the professional right is likely to heat up if the conflict drags on . \nMichael Moore 's tweeted sarcasm will set the tone for other liberal Obama critics on the netroots : `` We 've had a `` no-fly zone '' over Afghanistan for over 9 years . \nHow 's that going ? \nBut Moore 's suggestion that Obama return his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ignores the substance of what the president said in his acceptance speech : `` I believe that force can be justified on humanitarian grounds , as it was in the Balkans , or in other places that have been scarred by war . \nInaction tears at our conscience and can lead to more costly intervention later . \nThat is why all responsible nations must embrace the role that militaries with a clear mandate can play to keep the peace . '' \nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John P. Avlon . \n"}

'' \nHe said Libyans `` are leading the international war against imperialism , against despots and I tell you , I do not scare . '' \nGadhafi is violating the U.N. Security Council resolution by `` continued aggressive actions his forces have taken against the civilian population , '' U.S. Navy Adm. Samuel Locklear III said . \nLocklear also spoke about the U.S. F-15E Strike Eagle that had flown from Aviano air base in Italy to Libya , where the fighter experienced mechanical problems . \nBoth the pilot and the weapons officer ejected and were rescued within hours -- one retrieved by the U.S. military , the other by anti-Gadhafi Libyans . \nThe aviators , who suffered minor injuries when they landed , were both out of Libya and in U.S. hands , Locklear said . \nThe U.S. military dispatched a pair of Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft from the amphibious assault ship USS Kearsarge , about 100 miles off the coast of Libya , to rescue the downed aviators , said Capt. Richard Ulsh , spokesman for the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit . \nBut the two men landed in different places when they parachuted , and the U.S. rescue crew was able to pick up only the pilot . \nHe was flown to the Kearsarge , which has extensive medical facilities . \nLibyan rebels recovered the second crew member and treated him with `` respect and dignity '' until coalition forces were able to reach him , Locklear said . \nResidents in the area , some of whom witnessed the crash , told CNN they combed farmlands to search for the two Americans . \nThey also expressed their gratitude to coalition members for the United Nations-authorized coalition attack on Libyan air defense targets meant to protect civilians . \nLocklear said he would investigate reports villagers were injured when allied forces opened fire during rescue operations . \n`` The recovery mission from my perspective was executed as I would have expected it to be given the circumstances , '' he said . \nCriticism and questions persist about the Libyan campaign , with no clear answer on who will take over command of the military operation and what the endgame or exit strategy will be . \nBut U.S. officials said the international mission has succeeded in halting Gadhafi 's momentum . \nRebels help rescue U.S. serviceman Locklear told reporters that initial military strikes by the French , followed by attacks by Britain and the United States , have rendered Gadhafi 's long-range air defenses and his air force largely ineffective . \nAnd the Libyan opposition 's newly formed administration urged the international community to continue enforcing the U.N. charter . \n`` The interim national council has called on the international community to take all forceful deterrent measures , based on the U.N. charter and international covenants , to help the Libyan people put an end to further crimes against the humanity , '' the statement from the Transitional National Council said . \nMissiles rained down Tuesday and anti-aircraft fire pierced the night sky in Tripoli hours before dawn . \nThe Libyan government took international journalists to a port area that appeared to have been damaged by missile strikes that left craters 15 feet deep . \nA destroyed mobile rocket launcher system lay smoldering . \nSeveral warehouses were hit . \nThe United States fired 20 Tomahawk cruise missiles into Libya during a 12-hour period , said military spokeswoman Cmdr. Monica Rousselow . \nA total of 162 Tomahawks have been fired by the United States and Britain since the start Saturday of Operation Odyssey Dawn , which includes enforcement of a no-fly zone . \nThe operation has included 212 U.S. and 124 sorties . \nThe international operation has targeted air defense sites and command centers , but Gadhafi himself has not been targeted , and there are no plans to kill the leader , said Gen. Carter Ham , the head of U.S. forces in Africa . \n`` I could see accomplishing the military mission , which has been assigned to me , and the current leader would remain the current leader , '' he said . \n`` We think we have been very effective in degrading his ability to control his regime forces . '' \nHam said no Libyan aircraft have been observed flying since the military operations began Saturday . \nAnd air attacks have stopped Libyan ground forces from approaching the eastern rebel stronghold of Benghazi . \nBut fighting raged in Misrata , a city under siege two hours east of Tripoli . \nFour children in the same family were among 13 civilians killed in Misrata fighting Tuesday , said Dr. Khaled Mansouri of Misrata Central Hospital . \nAbout 30 people were injured , he told CNN . \nThe death toll from the clashes between Gadhafi forces and rebels in the city stands at 90 over the last five days . \nAn opposition spokesman who would give only his first name , Mohamed , told CNN the situation in the city is dire and worsening by the hour as Gadhafi forces have taken control of the main street that leads from the city center to a highway that connects Misrata to Tripoli . \nLoyalist snipers are on the top of buildings , he said . \nThe hospital is running out of medical supplies and are turning patients away , he said . \n`` I have seen a man whose broken arm is hanging being discharged because of lack of space , '' said Mohamed , who said he would not divulge his full name because of concern for his safety . \nHe said the city has been without water and electricity for nine days . \nViolence has raged in Libya following protests calling for democracy and demanding an end to Gadhafi 's almost 42-year rule . \nProtesters have been met by force from the Gadhafi regime , and numerous world leaders -- including U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon -- have denounced the killings of civilians by Gadhafi 's troops . \nThe U.N. Security Council passed a resolution Thursday that allows member states `` to take all necessary measures to protect civilians under threat of attack in the country ... while excluding a foreign occupation force of any form on any part of Libyan territory . '' \nIt also imposed a no-fly zone . \nBarak Barfi , a research fellow with the New America Foundation , said `` it 's certainly clear '' that the allied coalition has stymied the onslaught of Gadhafi troops against rebels in eastern Libya . \n`` Before the decision in the U.N. was taken Thursday , it seemed like Gadhafi was going to overrun the opposition in a matter of days , '' he said . \nBut `` it 's unclear if the rebels can form under any type of organized command and move forward now that the airstrikes have taken away Gadhafi 's offensive capabilities , '' Barfi said Tuesday . \n`` It 's unclear at this point in time who would take control after Gadhafi leaves . \nWe know that there are really no state institutions in Libya . '' \nA former Gadhafi aide told CNN Tuesday that the Libyan strongman would not go down easily . \nAbubaker Saad said Gadhafi has several bunkers deep underground and is likely hiding in one of them . \n`` As you probably all have noticed that now he is giving all of his statements by phone to the Libyan television , '' Saad said . \nObama said that once leadership of the military mission in Libya shifts from the United States to the coalition , `` it is not going to be our planes maintaining the no-fly zone '' and `` it is not going to be our ships that are necessarily enforcing the arms embargo . '' \nThere has been intense debate among the allies over NATO 's role going forward . \nThe natural choice to coordinate `` Operation Odyssey Dawn '' would seem to be NATO with its experience leading and coordinating international coalitions , but U.S. and European officials tell CNN that some allies , especially French President Nicolas Sarkozy , are concerned the action in Libya could be perceived negatively as another NATO operation in another Arab country . \nAnother complication is how to consolidate Arab support . \nThe United States expects additional Arab support for the coalition enforcing the no-fly zone over Libya , a senior administration official told reporters Tuesday . \nSo far , Qatar is the only Arab country that has contributed planes to mission . \nThe official said that several Arab states are in the process of finalizing their plans , adding the Obama administration was `` confident we will have further concrete contributions of different kinds '' for enforcement of the resolution in the next two to three days . \nCNN 's Nic Robertson , Arwa Damon , Amir Ahmed , Jilly Doughtery , Elisa Labott , Diana Magnay and Chris Lawrence contributed to this report \n"}

'' \nObama hopes Libyan rebels will organize Obama on Libya : We have saved lives Gadhafi ` not backing down one-inch ' Critics : U.S. ca n't afford Libya mission `` Our hope is that the first thing that happens once we clear this space is that the rebels start discussing how they 're able to organize themselves , how they articulate their aspirations for the Libyan people , '' Obama said . \n`` Potentially what we may see is all the enthusiasm that the Libyan people had for a change in government that was occurring a few weeks ago , '' but was brutally repressed by Gadhafi , can now resurface , the president said . \nIn particular , Obama said he hoped that the Libyan people decide it was time for a change that ends up sweeping Gadhafi from power . \nThe president acknowledged the irony of being a Nobel Peace Prize winner who ordered the U.S. military into action on the eight anniversary of the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq , but said the goal in this case was humanitarian . \n`` I 'm accustomed to this contradiction of being both a commander-in-chief but also somebody who aspires to peace , '' Obama said , adding the Libya mission was to protect the Libyan people from Gadhafi 's military . \n`` We 're not invading a country ; we are not acting alone , '' he said . \n`` We are acting under a mandate issued by the U.N. Security Council . '' \nThe American people will see no contradiction between someone who believes in peace and `` who wants to make sure people are n't butchered because of a dictator who wants to cling to power , `` Obama added . \nSpeaking in El Salvador on the final leg of a three-nation Latin American trip that included stops in Brazil and Chile , Obama also cited what he called a new relationship between the United States and the region to the south . \nHe noted that an area once known for dictatorships and coups now featured democratic governments that were less focused on political ideology and more focused on results in helping their people . \n`` That 's the kind of partner we want , '' Obama said , describing the relationship as a `` two-way street '' based on mutual respect , interests and trust , rather than the old model of underdeveloped nations approaching the United States with `` hat in hand . '' \nAsked about immigration reform back home , Obama said he would again make the push for a comprehensive bill . \n`` I 'm going to need some help , '' he said . \n`` I can get the majority of Democrats to support it . \nI need some help from Republicans . '' \nWith last year 's census results showing a growing Hispanic population in the United States , Obama said Republicans will have a hard time winning future elections if they focus on anti-immigration sentiment . \n"}

Security Council resolutions mandating international military intervention , albeit on different scales . \nIn Libya , aircraft were deployed to attack Gadhafi 's air defenses and to protect opposition rebels and civilians from government troops . \nIn Ivory Coast , extra troops were authorized earlier in the year increasing the size of the U.N. peacekeeping force to 11,000 , while France has dispatched 300 military personnel . \nTom Cargill , an Africa expert at the Chatham House think tank , says U.N.-sanctioned air strikes in the Ivory Coast conflict are unlikely . \n`` The situation has moved quickly with the rebels moving into built up areas , so there has n't been time to get a mandate from the U.N. , but because they are in built-up areas , that kind of intervention probably wo n't be something air forces would consider . '' \nAnalysts disagree on the reasons . \nCargill says the two can not be compared since Ivory Coast has endured years of crisis and a sustained international engagement aimed at finding a political solution . \nOthers like Clark point to more strategic factors , not least the fact that Western countries feel over-stretched by Libya and are unwilling to commit to the same level of action in Ivory Coast . \n`` I think Libya has in a sense acted as a kind of deterrent to collective action , '' says Knox Chitiyo , head of the Africa program at the UK 's Royal United Services Institute for Defense and Security Studies . \n`` In terms of escalation , -LRB- Ivory Coast -RRB- has been unfortunate in terms of timing , as the world 's attention has been focused on the Middle East and particularly Libya , so the Ivory Coast , which has been a slow-burning crisis , fell off the radar . '' \nYes , say some analysts . \nAs a major oil producer , Libya 's strategic significance is far greater than cocoa - and coffee-producing Ivory Coast , says Clark . \nLibya 's potential as an incubator for Middle Eastern democracy is also an attention-grabber for Western countries , he says . \n`` There is significant concern over Libya 's oil and what that would mean for Western strategic interest and there 's a sense that Libya fits into this wider pattern of democratization and the falling of draconian regimes in North Africa and the Middle East . '' \nKnox adds : `` Oil is seen by the West as a more strategic commodity than cocoa if we 're to be quite blunt . '' \nIs America likely to get involved in the same way it has in Libya ? \nNo , says Knox , partly because as he has shown with Libya , President Barack Obama is unwilling to take a leading role in multinational intervention . \nBut , he says , this is also because Obama would find it tough to convince a public disillusioned by America 's experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan , particularly given Ivory Coast 's perceived lack of strategic significance . \n`` We 've seen that Obama has had a real problem selling -LRB- intervention -RRB- to the U.S. audience , '' he said . \nWhy is France so involved ? \nAs Ivory Coast 's former colonial ruler , France not only has experience of working in the country but also appears to feel a duty to do so , pressing for Security Council action and dispatching troops . \nThis , says Yabi , creates its own problems as Gbagbo uses the French presence for his own benefit . \n`` Anti-colonial discourse is one of Gbagbo 's political weapons and he is trying to resuscitate that rhetoric against France . '' \nKnox adds that France 's involvement points to a broader campaign by Paris to inject itself into the international arena , as punctuated by President Nicolas Sarkozy -LRB- who is seeking re-election next year -RRB- taking a lead role in urging military action in Libya . \n"}

'' \nVan Uhm , chief of allied operations at NATO , defended the organization 's efforts , saying warplanes under NATO command flew 58 strike missions Monday , firing weapons and striking pro-Gadhafi targets on 14 of them . \nHe did not immediately have figures for previous days , but NATO spokeswoman Oana Lungescu said the warplanes had conducted 334 strike sorties since taking command of the mission on March 23 . \n`` I think you can safely say the operational tempo continues unabated , '' she said . \nIn addition to using human shields and hiding equipment in populated areas , pro-Gadhafi forces have begun abandoning heavy military equipment in favor of the same kinds of cars and light trucks the rebels travel in , making it even more difficult for pilots to distinguish rebel convoys from those carrying forces loyal to the regime , van Uhm said . \nSince the effort to enforce the U.N. resolution began in mid-March , airstrikes have taken out about 30 % of Gadhafi 's military capacity , van Uhm said . \nMonday 's airstrikes hit an active rocket launcher in al-Brega , an air defense installation and military vehicles near Misrata as well as ammunition storage facilities , van Uhm said . \nBut Gadhafi 's forces appeared to have the upper hand Tuesday in renewed fighting in al-Brega , where rebel forces were staging a panicked retreat under intense artillery bombardment , according to CNN reporters in the area . \nThe setback is the latest for a ragtag opposition that has struggled to maintain ground against the better-trained and - equipped Gadhafi forces , and it comes less than a day after rebel commanders said they had the longtime Libyan leader 's forces on the defensive in al-Brega . \nWith no end to the war in sight , a source close to the country 's leadership said a Libyan envoy is floating the idea of Gadhafi passing his power to a son -- a notion rebel leaders deem merely cosmetic . \nUnder the proposal , Saif al-Islam Gadhafi , 38 , would help to usher in reform , the source said . \nHowever , Saif Gadhafi has become one of his father 's most outspoken defenders since the start of the unrest despite once being perceived as a leading reformer in the Libyan government . \nA proposal to shift power from Gadhafi to his second-oldest son is `` a ridiculous offer , '' said Ali Aujali , a former Libyan ambassador to the United States who now represents the Libyan opposition in Washington . \n`` Libyan people , they decided , and they will not go back at all -LRB- to -RRB- Gadhafi or any member of his family , '' Aujali said . \n`` His sons , they are killers -- they 're just like their father . '' \nAujali said rebels are willing to offer Moammar Gadhafi and his family safe passage out of Libya in an exchange for an end to the fighting -- but that 's as far as their offer goes . \nThough Gadhafi has shown no signs of appeasing the opposition or relinquishing his power to anyone outside his family , cracks in his armor have surfaced . \nHis longtime confidant and foreign minister , Moussa Koussa , recently fled to London and announced his resignation from the Libyan government . \nOn Monday , the U.S. Treasury Department lifted the freeze on Koussa 's assets following his split from Gadhafi . \nOn Tuesday , Deputy Foreign Minister Khalid Khaim confirmed reports that Abdelati Obeidi is the nation 's new foreign minister . \nRebel spokesman Mustafa Gheriani said while the conflict persists , he remains hopeful for a revolution . \n`` I think the Gadhafi regime is crumbling from within , '' he said . \n`` I think if you look at history , people will always win , and I think victory will be ours .

Security Council about humanitarian issues Demonstrators gathered in front of the Arab League headquarters Cairo , Egypt -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Arab League voted Saturday to back a no-fly zone in Libya and is asking that the U.N. Security Council impose the measure , officials of the regional body told reporters . \n`` It has one goal : To protect the civilian population , '' Amre Moussa , the body 's secretary-general said . \n`` We will inform the U.N. Security Council of our request to enforce a no-fly zone over Libya , '' Moussa said . \n`` The U.N. Security Council should decide how it will be enforced . '' \nYoussef bin Alawi bin Abdullah , Oman 's foreign minister who joined Moussa to answer questions , said the no-fly zone would be a preventive measure and would have to be stopped immediately when the Libyan crisis ends . \nReporter : Gadhafi has the momentum now Rebel forces retreat in Libya Are Libyan rebels losing momentum ? \nHe said Arab League members have reservations about military intervention , but said all countries agreed that a no-fly zone must be imposed urgently to protect civilians . \n`` We hope the Libyan authorities will respect a no-fly decision , '' he said . \n`` Be assured the Arab countries will not accept the intervention of the NATO coalition . '' \nMoussa said the league also voted to open channels of communication with the Transitional National Council , the Libyan opposition 's newly formed administration , and that any talks with that body would be on a humanitarian basis . \n`` We are giving them legitimacy but we 're not giving them political recognition , '' Moussa said . \n`` We are prepared to help evacuate any Arab nationals from Libya regardless of their nationality . '' \nThe Arab League also called for immediate humanitarian assistance and an end to the bloodshed in Libya , where civil war has broken out between forces loyal to leader Moammar Gadhafi and a tenacious opposition movement . \nThe White House cheered the League 's announcements and stressed it will continue to pressure Gadhafi , support the opposition and prepare for `` all contingencies . '' \n`` We welcome this important step by the Arab League , which strengthens the international pressure on Gadhafi and support for the Libyan people , '' White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said in a statement about the Arab League 's no-fly vote . \nOpposition forces made strides in the early days of the rebellion , but Gadhafi 's military has recently gained strong momentum . \nThe military has been pounding the key oil port of Ras Lanuf , once in the hands of rebel forces , and has taken control of towns such as nearby Bin Jawad . \nThe Gadhafi government appears intent on retaking all territory from the opposition despite growing international pressure . \nThe League was meeting at its headquarters in Cairo , while hundreds of demonstrators outside urged the international community to step up support for Libyan opposition groups . \nPleading for international help as they continue to lose ground topro-Gadhafi forces , rebels are asking for a no-fly zone that would theoretically thwart airstrikes . \nNo-fly zones are areas where aircraft are not allowed to fly . \nSuch zones were put in place after the Gulf War in southern and northern Iraq as a check on the forces of the late Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein . \nWestern powers have said any action by the international community , including a no-fly zone , would have to have regional support and a clear mandate from the United Nations . \nU.S. President Barack Obama said Friday that he `` wo n't take -LRB- the -RRB- decision lightly '' on whether to use military force , including helping to enforce a no-fly zone , saying it is critical to `` balance costs versus benefits . '' \nWhile France has recognized the National Transitional Council as the sole representative of the Libyan people , the European Union was more restrained Friday , saying it `` welcomes and encourages the interim transitional national council based in Benghazi , which it considers a political interlocutor . '' \nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel was even more cautious in her approach to the council , calling it a possible interlocutor . \nBritain 's Foreign Office issued a statement after Saturday 's vote , saying , `` We welcome the Arab League 's decision to make contact with the Interim National Council , '' which the government sees as `` valid interlocutors . '' \nThe statement also said that no-fly zones are `` one option being considered as part of international contingency planning to respond quickly to events on the ground as they develop . \nThis planning does not pre-judge any particular outcome . '' \nFrench President Nicolas Sarkozy said in a news conference in Brussels , Belgium , Friday that `` we consider the National Council based in Benghazi as the proper interlocutors for Libya and they need to be recognized as such and encouraged . '' \nIn another diplomatic development , the U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Libya , Rashid Khalikov , arrived in Tripoli on Saturday to discuss access for humanitarian aid . \n`` The international aid community has expressed concerns over the very limited access to various areas in Libya , including those places where heavy fighting is taking place , '' Khalikov said . \nAbout 260,000 people , mostly third-country nationals , have left Libya for neighboring countries , primarily Tunisia and Egypt . \nIn response to the crisis , the United Nations and its partners launched a `` flash appeal '' seeking $ 160 million `` to assist both those leaving the country and those expected to need humanitarian assistance inside Libya , '' the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said . \nMeanwhile , the Libyan government on Saturday took journalists to the eastern city of Bin Jawad , where the government ousted rebels about a week ago . \nCNN 's Nic Robertson said he saw fighter jets in the sky but he did n't see them engage in strikes . \nHe saw some structural damage , such as a blown-out police station and damage to a school and houses , including a Katyusha rocket embedded in the wall of a house . \nSome stores were closed and others had been looted . \nCNN 's Reza Sayah and journalist Mohamed Fadel Fahmy contributed to this report . \n"}

'' \nIt is time for the Egyptian Army -LRB- funded by the United States -RRB- to come to the aid of their Libyan brothers . \nThe Tunisian and Egyptian people certainly do not think that a revitalized Gadhafi government is in their best interests . \nLet their ground forces and military hardware help the Libyan opposition forces while coalition forces -LRB- supported by the Arab League and the UN -RRB- take out the Libyan Airforce . \nMarch 14 , 2011 at 12:48 pm | Reply Fareed is a very smart man and thus his show is always thought provoking . \nHis open mind and high intellect must leave him respectively loney around CNN most of the time . \nThe Libya\\/Saudi issue has certainly painted the Americans into a corner now and it should be interesting to see how they wiggle out of it . \nHow do you claim to support the protesters -LRB- rebels -RRB- and their fight for freedom , democracy and a better standard of living ... then ignore the same thing happening in Saudi Arabia ? \nTo this point it actually seems worse in S.A. since the international media has been largley either contained or totally prevented from reporting ... even as Saudi leaders opennly threaten violence against any who dare raise a finger against them . \nSo which is it ... ? \nCore values should n't depend on the amount of oil someone has ... but apparently it does . \nThat 's just amazing . \nMarch 12 , 2011 at 5:54 pm | Reply Hopefully Fareed and his panel will address the hypocrisy regarding the American stance on the present Middle East situation . \nA previous post touches on the glorification and villification taking place in the media . \nAs one who has followed this story very closely it certainly appears that unbiased reporting is simply not happening . \nWe see footage of rebels firing big rockets in the general direction of cities yet by all admissions they are n't trained at all and likley have no idea where they 'll land and explode . \nYet nothing of the possible relationship between that and innocent people being killed ? \nWe saw many thousands of immigrant workers fleeing the country after being threatened , beaten , raped and robbed by Libyans ... yet no reporting on which Libyans ... why ? \nThere 's been much reported about the Libyan planes dropping bombs yet nothing about the very obvious control being shown `` not '' to blow up crowds of armed protesters . \nStill waiting to hear from the the Americans if all of the compassion they seem to have for the rebels will also apply to rebels in Saudi Arabia when they stand up for their freedom and dreams of democracy ? \nSo far it seems they 're sticking their heads in the sand and ignoring everything they claimed to care about ... supporting peaceful protest ... assisting people seeking democracy ... and stand behind those fighting oppression ... and what about that freedom of the press thing ? \nI guess 20 % of global oil can buy some pretty big blinders ... Wow ! \nMarch 12 , 2011 at 6:36 pm | Reply The problem here Neil , is the biased reporting by the right-wing news media against Qadaffi and the even yet more tyranical Suadi leaders , they say nothing . \nThe same media was also biased in favor of Hosni Mubarak before his downfall . \nMarch 12 , 2011 at 7:00 pm | Reply Is Joe Biden right wing -- he asserted that Mubarak wasn t a dictator . \nButw why would he know ? \nDoing the job they were elected to do is apparently beyond their interest and perhaps their ability . \nMarch 13 , 2011 at 2:14 pm | There should n't be a liberal or conservative , `` peaceniks vs hawks '' , view regarding the Libyan situation . \nWe should all feel the same regarding the atrocities that Gadaffi is committing against Libyans . \nUnlike the previous leaders in Tunesia and Egypt , Gadaffi is willing to spill any amount of blood to preserve his power , and he has total control of his military . \nAs such the west should attempt to equalize the advantage Gadaffi has . \nLibya needs not only a no-fly zone , but a NO-TANK zone enforced by the west . \nThis will give the Libyan pro-democracy fighters a fighting chance to recover their country . \nThis is coming from a person who is normally quite liberal and in the peacenik camp on US intervention . \nThe Libyan people deserve help , especially since many of those weapons used against them were sold to them by the west . \nMarch 12 , 2011 at 7:10 pm | Reply It would be great to have a few of the questions I posted answered . \nBeing left without knowledge of those things makes it difficult to take a stance one way or the other . \nWorse yet having such obvious questions apparently left willfully unaddressed casts doubt on what we ` are '' being told as it presents as groomed information with an agenda attached . \nMarch 12 , 2011 at 7:42 pm | Reply Today Skky News was showing the rebels in Benghazi picking out people `` presumably '' Ghadafi supporters and beating them senseless while camera is rolling ! \nAnd anyone who is black these rebels are accusing to be `` mercenaries '' , they shoot them on site and beat them to death ! \nWhat a way to `` democracy '' ! \nIt looks to me we may be on the wrong side here and decided hastily . \nIs this what we are supporting ? \nShame !! March 13 , 2011 at 5:45 am | Reply It is astonishing that no CNN commentors , including Dr. Zakaria , have discussed the possibility of Turkey assuming a role in the current Libyan situation . \nThe Prime Minister of Turkey has reacted publicly to the situation , and I for one have been quietly encouraging the Turkish government to assume an active role right now , and indeed getting involved in the move towards democracy sweeping through the region . \nDiscussion of this matter is increasing in Turkey . \nI urge Dr Zakaria to interview the Turkish Foreign Minister and possibly also the Prime Minister of Turkey . \nSoon Not one American soldier should ever be allowed to fight and die on Lybian soil . \nThese same Lybian people who are asking for US intervention are the same ones who cheered at the downing of the plane over Lockerby Scotland , the collapse of the trade centers , and the release of the terrorists who caused the plane to go down . \nI do not care how much I will have to pay for gas , or anything else . \nNo more intervention using Americans to keep a few rich from oil . \nThe libyan people will just have to figure it out for themselves . \nYou reap what you sow . \nMarch 13 , 2011 at 10:52 am | Reply THE TIME TO QUIT DANCING ... The word WAR is incomplete when pointing to places like Iraq , Afghanistan , Egypt or Libya War is akin to references like WW I or WW II . \nWhat we really have here is terrorism by thugs who are killing their own people and expecting other free countries to ignore them . \nThis does not mean that America should stay on the sidelines because that would also be stupid . \nYou would not ignore someone that was killing your family , friends and neighbors would you ? \nThis is frankly not what good and decent people do . \nShould we get involved in Libya now ? \nYes ... along with the rest of the world 's leaders because to ignore heavy handed nut-jobs like Libya 's Moammar Gadhafi and his sons who are killing innocent human beings and citizens of Libya . \nThey should know that the world is watching and they too can be erased from the face of the planet . \nBombs Away they should not be even given the chance to step down or have the choice to go to another country because they sure as hell have not given that choice to their own citizens . \nIt is not time to let the situation get any worse by lost life of innocent people one day longer ! \nThey need help now ! \nWhether that be arms , or a no-fly zone . \nThis can not be looked at as a declaration of war but an act of humanity to a one sided conflict between Gadhafi and their own citizens . \nMarch 13 , 2011 at 11:04 am | Reply Fareed what would be the best use of all the seized money from Gaddafi and Mubarak ? \nDo you think it would be best to use the money to buy mac computers -LRB- because of their anivirus capability built in -RRB- for every citizen and offer wireless internet for the entire country ? \nI feel stongly that it would make a huge difference in womens rights finally if they could see how women are treated in other countries . \nWhen you travel to Egypt it feels like being droped in a Bible setting for a movie that has never changed due to being cut off from the world . \nMarch 13 , 2011 at 11:40 am | Reply No administration should be so callous as to make statements indicating that it will support people who revolt against a tyranical ruthless regime unless it is actually prepared to do so . \nThe first Bush administration did that at the end of the first Gulf war and many thousands of Iraqis were slaughtered . \nThe Obama administration is doing the same thing now and many thousands of Libyans will probably be slaughtered by the psycopathic Gaddafi regime . \nOccasionally a golden opportunity comes along to rid the world of a particularly heinous dictator ; at a time when the local citizenry is ready to most of the fighting . \nBut that time frame is often limited . \nIt looks like we will miss the boat again . \nMarch 13 , 2011 at 11:34 am | Reply somali pm . . \nmohamad is doing great job , we should him his figth agianst alqaida in africa March 13 , 2011 at 12:33 pm | Reply If the Arab League supports a no-fly zone in Libya , let the Saudi Arabian airforce do it . \nThey have the planes . \nThe US could supply an AWACS . \nWhy is it always supposed to be the US ?

'' \nNothing could be further than the truth . \nI recently returned from several months in Bahrain and decided to conduct some research on the Arab monarchies . \nMost of the Arab monarchies -LRB- Jordan being the notable exception -RRB- can claim legitimacy through a long and documented history . \nAlthough the modern Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was created in 1932 , control of the Arabian Peninsula by the al-Saud family dates back to 1744 . \nThe al-Thani family has dominated Qatar more or less continuously since the late 19th century . \nIn the case of Bahrain , control of the island by the al-Khalifa family there dates from 1783 . \nIn the Emirates , all their ruling families all go back to the 1700 's , too . \nAnd did you know -- the first country in the world to recognize the independence of the United States of America was the Kingdom of Morocco -- in 1777 -- under the reign of King Mohammed III . \nThe two countries signed a Treaty of Peace and Friendship in 1787 . \nIn fact the Arab monarchies are no less legitimate than those of the United Kingdom , Spain , Belgium , the Netherlands , Denmark , Norway and Sweden . \nThe problems in the Arab monarchies are not due to any presumed illegitimacy of the ruling families , but rather to a lack of popular representation in government . \nChanges have been occurring . \nBahrain , for example , has a constitution -LRB- the first constitution dates from 1973 ; a new constitution was promulgated in 2002 -RRB- . \nThe constitution guarantees free and fair elections within universal suffrage for the lower house of its legislature . \nThe most recent elections were held on October 23 , 2010 . \nThis is a first step that other Arab monarchies can follow . \nI suggest that you conduct your own research and inform your millions of viewers of the truth about Arab monarchies . \nI have been watching GPS religiously for 2 years , and am now in Nigeria doing some work before the upcoming election here . \nI introduced my two Nigerian friends to your show this weekend , and it was a great weekend to do so ! \nThey were `` spellbound '' -LRB- their words -RRB- by this segment and the segment about China 's military . \nThe panel you put together for this segment on the Arab street was gripping , fascinating , and a great introduction to smart people that Americans do n't get to hear from enough -LRB- instead we get to listen to Mitch McConnell over and over -RRB- . \nI think Mr. Khouri was correc that the principles in the declaration of independence do apply universally , and that the United States is living proof of their veracity . \nWe in Nigeria will see you next week ! \nMarch 14 , 2011 at 4:53 am | Reply The rebels in Libya lack careful planning and calculation . \nAfter the events in Tunisia and Egypt they just jumped on the bandwagon of freedom and played by ear . \nFacebook and Twitter contributed to their success at the beginning . \nThen they began to suffer setbacks . \nMaybe in the age of technology a successful revolution still needs a guide . \nMarch 14 , 2011 at 5:46 am | Reply -LRB- required , but will not be displayed -RRB- CNN welcomes a lively and courteous discussion as long as you follow the Rules of Conduct set forth in our Terms of Service . \nComments are not pre-screened before they post . \nYou agree that anything you post may be used , along with your name and profile picture , in accordance with our Privacy Policy and the license you have granted pursuant to our Terms of Service . \nEnter your email address to follow this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email . \nWhat #Pope Benedict leaves behind : Kathleen Sprows Cummings gives her take on GPS : bit . \nly\\/11C7KM4 Poor sanitation , water supply cause economic losses of about $ 260 billion annually in developing nations : World Bank bit . \nly\\/11Bw3d6 3:44 pm ET February 11 , 2013 RETWEET `` Since peaking in 2009 at 10.1 % of GDP , U.S. budget deficit has fallen . \nThis year , CBO says , it will be 5.3 % '' : Cassidy nyr . \nkr\\/12tXrci 12:35 pm ET February 11 , 2013 RETWEET What has #China banned TV advertisements for ? \nTry the GPS weekly quiz to find out : bit . \nly\\/Y4AvJ6 9:32 am ET February 11 , 2013 RETWEET Five Arab leaders give their take on regional issues on GPS this Sunday at 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. ET on CNN \n"}

'' \nThe TNC has been rocked by internal divisions , with rival rebel groups battling each other . \nThe divisions create a dilemma for the Obama administration , which recognized the rebel movement based in Benghazi as Libya 's rightful government on July 15 at an international meeting on Libya in Istanbul . \nThe move , done in coordination with the international community , paves the way for the United States to reopen the embassy , accredit diplomats and unfreeze billions of dollars in frozen assets . \nThe internal strife within the rebel movement comes as the State Department prepares to hand over the Libyan embassy to the TNC as the recognized government of Libya , according to U.S. officials . \nThe officials say the move would allow the TNC to re-open the embassy , accredit diplomats and regain control of the embassy 's frozen bank account , worth about $ 13 million . \nRift in Libya rebels rank ? \nDetails murky on Libya rebel chief death It follows a formal request from the TNC to re-open the embassy under its control and accredit Ali Aujali , the former Libyan ambassador to the United States , as its charge d'affaires . \nIn March , the State Department ordered the Libyan embassy in Washington closed and kicked diplomats loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi out of the country . \nAujali had resigned his post as the regime 's ambassador to the United States in February and has since represented the opposition in Washington . \n`` We are consulting with the National Transitional Council on a broad range of issues , and that includes diplomatic accreditation and representation , '' Toner said . \nDespite the divisions within the TNC , the State Department publicly expressed confidence in the rebels . \n`` We believe that this is the legitimate representatives of the Libyan people during this transition period , '' Toner said . \n`` This is an extremely challenging period for Libya and they are dealing with these challenges as they come . \nBut we have confidence that they can weather this . '' \nBut privately , U.S. officials acknowledge there is some concern about the apparent disarray within the rebel movement , although officials say it is not surprising . \n`` This is a tribal society , '' one official said . \n`` We knew from the start this could be messy and there was always the concern about not moving too fast . \nWe had no illusions about the TNC , but they have done a pretty good job and look better to us than Gadhafi at this point . '' \nNATO has been bombing Libya for more than four months under a U.N. mandate to protect civilians from troops loyal to Gadhafi , who is battling a rebellion that has claimed control of the eastern half of the country . \nThe U.S. Embassy in Tripoli was shuttered and American personnel evacuated by sea and air in late February , after the current revolt against Gadhafi erupted . \nLibyan and U.S. officials held face-to-face talks in Tunisia last month , but Washington says the sole point of the meeting was to repeat its demand that Gadhafi `` must go . '' \nAlso Sunday , state TV aired video of Saif al-Islam Gadhafi , Gadhafi 's son , speaking to what was described as displaced families . \nHe has not been seen speaking in public for weeks . \n`` Whether NATO stays or not , the battle will continue until Libya is freed , '' he said , stressing the right of people to fight . \n`` Let me say to you that the battle will not stop . \nEvery one of you : return to your homes and farms and villages and jobs with peace of mind . \nWe will not stop !

'' \n`` But when a person starts talking about killing his own citizens and then following up on it , creating rivers of blood in his own streets and blowing up the one resource that his country has to give it a foundation for any economic hope , he 's clearly a mad man and this is a person who is maniacal and now we are beginning to learn that he did in fact order the bombing of Pan Am 103 over the Lockabee , the disco in Berlin . \nYou know these are acts of international terrorism and I expect more than a strongly worded letter from the UN . '' \nOn what actions he 'd take toward Libya if he was president : `` I think a no-fly zone would be absolute -- yeah a no fly zone very important because that way you keep him from flying mercenaries in , maybe even a naval armada somewhere off the 3 mile international boundaries , just as a presence , and even to say we stand ready to do what is necessary to make sure there 's not an act of genocide against those people . '' \nOn whether President Obama is being too timid in his handling of the crisis : `` In light of the urgency , but I do n't have the NSA report sitting in front of me . \nSo I 'm always a little careful to say , here 's what I would do , because I think you have to base a decision based on good intelligence and information which a person in my capacity as an ordinary citizen at this point simply does n't have . '' \nOn the role his new book plays in his presidential decision-making process : `` This is the message . \nIf people read this book and say those are some ideas I can relate to , these are ideas I think would be good for the country , then that 's going to help me believe that there is real support for what I stand for . \nI do n't think politics and running for president is just about can I go through the political manipulations to get the job . \nIt 's , if I get that job , do the people of the country support what I would do and I think I owe it to them to say , ` Here 's what I do , here 's where I stand . \nThese are my principals . ' '' \nOn Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels ' call for a `` truce '' on social issues until economic problems are dealt with : `` I make it very clear , in the very first chapter , I establish that the issues about family and marriage are economic issues . \nWe have a 300 billion dollar a year dad deficit in this country . \nThat 's the cost that the taxpayers for dads who disappear and let the government pick up the tabs for their kids . \nWe have an issue also where two thirds of the children of this country who live in poverty would n't live in poverty if their mothers were married to the fathers of those kids . \nSo when people say , ' I do n't want to talk about social issues ' - and let me be very clear , I love Mitch Daniels . \nI think he would be a great presidential candidate , I think he would be a good president , but I 'm not arguing with Mitch Daniels . \nI 'm making the case that you can not say these are peripheral issues if you really are concerned about the economy because there is an economic consequence of a broken family . '' \nOn overturning Roe v. Wade : `` I think it 's a bully pulpit and it goes beyond just Roe versus Wade . \nSee , all that did was say that the states no longer could make the decision , the federal government would . \nIf you turned it back to the states , some states would have more liberal abortion than they have now . \nIt would n't necessarily fix anything and then you have this geographical morality which I find absurd . \nThat is the logic of the civil war , that you can have some states where slavery is okay and others where it is n't . \nThat does n't make sense . \nIf it 's right then everybody ought to abide by it . \nIf it 's wrong , them everyone ought to change . \nSo the question is , is it right for one human being to take the life of another human being because it represents a financial burden or a social disruption ? \nNow that 's an argument we can have but once we 've had it , we have to decide that either it is okay or is n't okay . \nI say it 's not okay . '' \n`` I think the president stepped off into a deep hole when he decided arbitrarily and I think illegally that his attorney general and his justice department will not even defend the law of the land which is the Defense of Marriage Act . \nI think I 've spent a page , maybe a page and a half of that entire book dealing with this issue . \nIt 'll probably get a lot of controversy . \nI invite people to read it for themselves . \nRead it and if they think that I 'm off-base , fine -- then they can sell it at a used book store . \n`` Government should legislate affirmation of what marriage is . \nMarriage is not whatever we want it to be . \nMarriage is a man and a woman committed in a relationship for life , that 's all it 's ever been . \nThirty-three states have had this on the ballot . \nThirty-three , including very liberal states like Maine and California , and in every one of those states , no exceptions , none , those states have affirmed marriage to mean what it has traditionally meant . \nOn Mitt Romney 's imposition of a universal health care plan in Massachusetts when he was governor : `` I think the objective analysis of the Massachusetts plan has been that it is done exactly opposite of what it was supposed to do . \nIt was supposed to lower costs , it raised costs . \nSupposed to create access , people now have a hard time getting into the doctor . \nIt was supposed to open up broader levels of coverage , now people are having to cut back coverage because they ca n't afford everything that they put out there on the plate I do n't think this is a political killer for Governor Romney , but I think he has to come out and say , ` States are supposed to take bold actions . ' '' \nI mention in the book the quote by Louis Brandeis , Supreme Court justice back in 1932 , who talked about states as a laboratory so that you test it in a state , not the whole country . \nIf it works you do it , if it does n't work you do n't inflict it upon the other fifty states .

\nYeah , what a disaster and other countries know it . \nFebruary 24 , 2011 03:34 pm at 3:34 pm | The no fly zone is not entirely up to Obama and Huck is right he is not privy to the information needed to pass an opinion . \nHe should share that with Republican leader Palin . \nThe efforts in Libya are not just that of the US and people have to realize there is a lot at stake here and a no fly zone is a gamble that could go horribly wrong . \nObama was excellent on this issue by making sure that he did not cock off towards Gadhafi before the Americans in Libya were secured . \nGadhafi could potentially blow up the oilfeilds and kill thousands of innocent people and this has to be handled properly just like Obama is doing . \nGood for Huck in keeping the right tone here February 24 , 2011 03:35 pm at 3:35 pm | Yes , I see it now . \nHuckabee would be a good president for Libya . \nAnd I 'm sure ` DemoCommunists for a Better Way -- Bankruptcy ' will vote for him too . \nIf there are two people who deserve to be in Libya , it is those two , becasue they have clearly given up on being in any western country that embraces the Enlightenment . \nFebruary 24 , 2011 03:56 pm at 3:56 pm | Does the man understand the term civil war ?

\nHe seems to have an answer for ever thing . \nPresident Obama is doing just fine . \nThe previous administration left this country in the ditch and it is going to take years to get this ship right . \nWe have two wars that we are currently engaged in that is a big drain our economy and the damage that banks did to us with the toxic loans is more than enough . \nAll of this corruption and no one is being prosecuted because of what ? \nWe also have the Kouch brothers that are influencing the Republicans to bust the unions to put more money in their pockets . \nSo IMO the President is doing just fine . \nFebruary 24 , 2011 04:06 pm at 4:06 pm | Frankly , I do n't mind Huckabee as a person , seems likable though I completely disagree with his beliefs . \nWay too religious for office . \nFebruary 24 , 2011 04:18 pm at 4:18 pm | February 24 , 2011 04:21 pm at 4:21 pm | equal means equal ! \nall americans , gay or straight or somewhere in between , should have the same basic rights and that includes the right to marry . \nthey may not want to exercise that right as often as newt gingrich has but they should have that option . \nFebruary 24 , 2011 04:23 pm at 4:23 pm | -LRB- Insert Repub dipster 's name here -RRB- comments included criticizing President Obama over -LRB- anything and everything -RRB- . \nOnly a fool would ever listen to these media whores who continue to flap their lips and are completely uninformed -LRB- they do n't get high-level briefings -RRB- and have absolutely no responsibility with the outcome of the situations President Obama deals with every day . \nIt 's such a sad commentary on our nation that we have so many willing to do so much to try to make our president and our country fail , simply to gain personal and political power . \nFebruary 24 , 2011 04:25 pm at 4:25 pm | Why is n't Huckabee advocating we attack North Korea ?

\nWhen Scotland pardoned the Lockerbie bombers , should we have invaded Great Britain ? \nWhat about Somalia and the former Yugoslavia ; did Huckabee support our efforts there or did he sit on the sidelines and criticize President Clinton -LRB- because he 's a Democrat -RRB- ?

February 26th , 2011 9:15 am ET It is really heartening to see the people protesting in Libya and seizing control of the cities . \nIt is a great moment of history and for Arab civilization . \nIn the Middle East , the thugs and dictators were ruling . \nAnd democracy must come whatever the cost may be . \nI appeal to the people of Libya and other countries in the middle East that they should not tolerate the dictators and kings anymore . \nThey suck the blood of the general mass . \nAll these years they have exploited the common man in the name of good rule , but in fact they have been busy in filling up their coffers . \nWhenever there is a news of protests in the middle east i really rejoice that at last the people are demanding change in the form of the government . \nThe people around the world are with you . \nDo not fear the might of the dictators and thugs , very soon they will flee the country . \nThey just do not have option . \nAnd they have to go . \nCongratulations to the people of Arabian countries for rising against the thugs . \nFebruary 26th , 2011 12:06 pm ET its about time that the libyan people must show their unity in ousting a desperate dictator . \nImagine for 42 years the people were made to believe that the kind of leadership he -LRB- khadafi -RRB- perpertrated in libya is the only key to a prosperous nation . \nBut what had happened now ? \nThis oil rich nation started to crumble . . \nkhadafi is hellbent on staying to power . \nNo matter what , he will continue to use force and psychological warfares . . \nDictators are made to use this methods . \nAll I can say is the Libyan people must continue and advance their struggle . \nProtect the conquered cities in the east ... and most importantly unite for one common enemy against the madman . \nFebruary 26th , 2011 4:06 pm ET From the shores of Tripoli As I sit in Kuwait , a cloudy day for a celebration , but none the less the Kuwaitis have and are celebrating their 50th year of Independence -LRB- 25 Feb -RRB- and their 20th year of Liberation Day -LRB- 26 Feb -RRB- and we are watching the Kuwaitis in their usual elevated sense of nationalism and patriotism -LRB- akin to our 4th of July -RRB- move forward into their life in a very jubilant manner . \nI remember quite well the sense of relief when Iraq and it s barbaric occupation of Kuwait came to an end at the concerted effort of the coalition forces , not the least of which was the United States . \nWe are now observing the many activities of nations here in the Middle East as they go through the struggles to move forward and build democratic nations . \nCurrently , the largest and most notable effort is in Libya . \nFreedom from oppression and freedom of choice does not come free , and never will . \nAmericans , who established a nation , built from wilderness and paid for by the blood of men and women who desired to live a free life in a democratic society with a government whom they controlled are now looking as they have progressed for several hundred years from the meager beginnings as pilgrims to the nowadays pioneers in the countries of the Middle East . \nThose pioneers desire the same basic human rights as felt by their brethren in many other places in the world . \nWhen Americans sit idly by , great evil is furthered by those who would oppress the ones who feed them . \nWe have seen this all over the world and unfortunately , as even we recognize the wrong , we are slow to respond to the cries of the oppressed . \nIt happened in Germany , most notably , prior to the outbreak of World War II and several times since . \nWe are currently fighting in several locations around the world were people have been oppressed and downtrodden , rights denied , lives lost and freedoms forbidden by those who have claimed to be leaders . \nAs times have marched on , so has technology and the atrocities of today , are witnessed and commented on ... today . \nWE also have the ability to react today and not by just sucking in our breath as we see and hear of such unacceptable actions such as what is apparent in Libya . \nAmericans are great businessmen , probably the greatest in the world . \nOur economy , our business systems and finance are efficient and profitable . \nThe world has recognized this for some time . \nOur country is a beloved country and most wanted after by most countries , if not simply a great enjoyment to visit . \nThe people of the Middle East have a great love for the United States . \nThey may not always agree with our President , our international politics and relations with other countries , but greatly love the country and its people . \nThis point is something which , I believe our politicians have missed , ignored or simply have no idea on how to capitalize from the benefit of such an asset in foreign relations actions . \nWE have wavered between the balance of power , sovereign recognition of powers in countries , benefits of business and economics , the benefits of balance in the lesser of evils and so on . \nIn most cases this is the best anyone could do . \nIn the worst case , which is where we usually find ourselves , we can please all the people and all the countries all the time . \nWE have helped many and been criticized for doing so by just as many . \nThe question remains , as any individual must ask , did I do the right thing ? \nYou can t please everyone , but you can be true to your ethics and principles in doing what is right , what is fair and what is generous to help others . \nSimply put , it is the American way and also the way of a vast majority of other people on this planet . \nOur inaction towards Libya is pathetic . \nWe are looking at a country which , has not been our friend , but could be . \nWe are looking at a country that needs and whose people greatly need and have asked for our guidance , help , support and any assistance which we could easily provide . \nIt is now obvious to the world that things are not right there with the ruler , Gaddafi , killing his own people and oppressing the country in the way it now appears . \nWE have nothing to lose at this point . \nWe don t have to go in like the Marines did long ago . \nWE don t need to arrive en masse and occupy the country after saving it . \nWE do need to show support with more than a limp speech and a wait and see attitude . \nThe entire Middle East is upset to say the least with Gaddafi and what is happening . \nThe vast supporters of the opposition in Libya wish they could do something to help . \nThe Arab world will without doubt , sit , watch , and not take any direct action to save the people of Libya . \nNow , for the less liberal , less weak approach we need to make some threats of a rather direct type -LRB- sanctions are meaningless and only hurt the folks we should be helping -RRB- . \nWE should , and we easily have the resources sitting in the Mediterranean , park an aircraft carrier , a destroyer , a missile frigate and a contingency of US Marines off the coast of Libya and provide some sort of direct intervention into the situation if the Gaddafi government does not cease and desist immediately . \nWE can do this and guess what , who cares if we get another black eye kicking a bully out and taking care of some people who need our help . \nWE might even make a few new friends . \nIf I were calling the shots , the threats would only be a veiled pretext to just carrying out what needs to be done in a rather surgical manner anyway . \nYou get what you ask for . \nFebruary 26th , 2011 6:11 pm ET One question that is shouting in our face and nobody seems to be aware of it : WHY DOES N'T THE ARAB LEAGUE INTERVENE ???? There is talk of NATO and US military intervention to stop the unbelievable atrocities of Gaddaffi against his own people , of gathering up UN support for such an action . \nThe problem is we all know what will happen after a NATO or US military action ; it will eventually be seen and portrayed as another imperialist action by the west , trying to impose its own values on an arab state , and doing it anyway only for the oil there . \nThis will in turn weaken the moral standing in the arab world of those that genuinely want democracy and freedom . \nThe only solution is for the Arab League to intervene on the ground to stop this madness , and thus preventing any `` western imperialism '' argument against the local democracy advocates later on . \nIt has already given verbal condemnation of Gaddafi 's actions , and they should prove that these are not empty words . \nFebruary 27th , 2011 1:45 am ET News of former Justice Minister Mustafa Abdul Jalil to head the Libya by replacing Gadhafi is great & healthy news . \nIt is an indication that Gadhafi & his sons have given up to people pressure & voices of world in response to USA & UNO sanctions whatever . \nIt is better for Gadhafi to transfer the power to Justice Abdul & other countries in the Mid-East should also respond with similar action wherever the turmoil is to hand over power to Justices ex of Courts to facilitate legal & democratic Govt . \nwith written Constitutions to avoid exploitation of people & natural national resources for few elite & political families . \nIt is time for Iran too To give up fake Islamic spiritualism & hand over power to people of Iran who are struggling since last election frauds to Justice of Supreme Court if they have one or opposition group to move forward with legitimate & legal agenda of Iran Democracy which was supposed to be after dethroning Shah of Iran & expected by people of Iran & young generation of Iran who struggling for liberty , freedom & development . \nWho is this `` Kadafi '' you speak of ??? You pretend to know something and yet you have no clue how to spell a name which has been splashed all over the media for two weeks ??? Yes , you must know so much ... A squirrel in a tree has more knowledge than you . \nI guess you must be one of those orthodox Jewish Israelis who does n't go to school or get a job , but lives freely of the Israeli state -LRB- US taxes -RRB- to study orthodox Jewish mythology . \nYour ideas are probably really popular in your mentally challenged environment . \nFebruary 27th , 2011 10:01 pm ET It was explained why the U.S. and\\/or Obama is low-key on this country and what 's happening ! \nThe reason is\\/was to protecct any Americans i.e. , not to have them taken Americans hostages ! \nFebruary 27th , 2011 10:05 pm ET It was explained why the U.S. and\\/or Obama is\\/was low-key on Libya and what 's happening there ! \nThe reason is\\/was to protect Americans i.e. , not to have Americans taken as hostages . \nIsrael does not have the biggest military in the ME although it may be the strongest and best organized . \nIt , without doubt , has the most thorough , honest and transparent legal division which ensures that international law is consulted before every mission and any deviation from approved codes of conduct is subsequently investigated and if necessary refered to external investigation . \nIf is argued by some that the Israeli army would be even stronger if it did not have to spend almost 80 % of the military aid it receives from the US back in the US which although providing for thousands of American jobs also hinders Israel 's ability to increase further its own advanced military developments . \n-LRB- Israel receives only military aid . \nNo economic aid so forget your claims that Israeli education , or ultra-orthodox lack of it , is paid for by US taxpayers . \nSave that argument for the hate and anti-semitism that is taught in Arab schools\\/midrassas throughout the region paid for by US and EU etc taxes -RRB- . \nMeanwhile , as you may have been implying , the US and others have provided far more support to regimes in the ME which are finally being revealed for what they are . \nYou fail to question the West 's neutrality in that respect when their hypocrisy and moral compromise is staring you in the face . \nEveryone kicks up to the level of his personal potential . \nGood example : John A. - kicks very low ! \n- Fight forever to impose worldwide a 7 century culture - Making revolution and busting Islamism 's Muslim brotherhood Islamist - Politicians agenda do n't call to deal with Muslim society issues March 1st , 2011 10:30 am ET Miriam , Even Israel 's Jewish Virtual Library explains your ideas are as delusional as your friend Ariely 's . \nA pro Israeli Library states American aids to Israel is -LRB- but they forget to mention many other benefits , because the real numbers would terrify American tax payers -RRB- : Altogether , since 1949 , Israel has received more than $ 106 billion in assistance . \nThis includes the four special allocations , the $ 10 billion in loan guarantees -LRB- spread over five years -RRB- approved in 1992 , the $ 9 billion in guarantees offered in 2003 , and a variety of other smaller assistance-related accounts , such as refugee resettlement -LRB- nearly $ 1.6 billion overall since 1973 -RRB- , the American Schools and Hospitals Abroad Program -LRB- ASHA -RRB- , which supports schools , libraries and medical centers that demonstrate American ideas and practices -LRB- -LRB- $ 144 million -RRB- , and cooperative development programs -LRB- a total of $ 186 million since 1981 -RRB- . \nThe total does not include funds for joint military projects like the Arrow missile -LRB- for which Israel has received more than $ 1 billion in grants since 1986 -RRB- , which are provided through the Defense budget . \nPresident Bush requested $ 60 million for the Arrow for FY2003 and $ 136 million in FY2004 . \nThe United States also has provided $ 53 million for the Boost Phase Intercept program and $ 139 million for the Tactical High Energy Laser program under development in Israel to complement the Arrow . \nThough the totals are impressive , the value of assistance to Israel has been eroded by inflation . \nWhile aid levels remained constant in total dollars from 1987 until 1999 , the real value steadily declined . \nOn the other side of the coin , Israel does receive aid on more favorable terms than other nations . \nFor example , all economic aid is given directly to the Israeli government rather than allocated under a specific program . \nAlso , starting in 1982 , Israel began to receive all its economic aid in a lump sum early in the fiscal year instead of in quarterly installments as is done for other countries . \nIsrael also receives offsets on FMS purchases -LRB- U.S. contractors agree to offset some of the cost of military equipment by buying components or materials from Israel -RRB- . \nIt was inevitable that Libyans would sack Gadahafi despite the propaganda he attempted to spread at a time even the military turned against him . \nMercenaries in Libya were only interested in loot . \nWhatever they could derive from the chaos . \nHe lost his legitimacy the moment the protests began and the honorable thing for him to have done was to quit . \nIt 's really worthy of celebration . \nBravo to Libyans and the rest of the world . \nCheers guys and all the best . \nIt can only get better . \nOk guys and I 'm always much obliged . \nFirstly , the Jewish Virtual Library is not Israeli and is a reference library encyclopedia . \nSince you provided the link , it is easy for everyone to see that you have selectively copied and pasted a couple of paragraphs obviously written number of years ago . \nThe whole article has clearly - been updated several times over several years . \nYou conveniently do n't include the details of how there is no longer any US economic aid to Israel , that US economic grants to Israel ended in 1959 and until 1985 aid consisted of loans that were repaid . \nOne can also read that before 1971 , Arab states received three times more aid than Israel , plus additional aid from the USSR , Europe , Asia etc. . \nSo , far from being delusional , the facts are clear . \nIsrael does not receive economic aid from the US . \nWhat you have succeeded in doing is bringing to are attention the fact that you have a persistent ability to be very selective in your copy and pastes , conveniently obscuring the whole picture . \nYou 've also enabled us to again refute many other claims you have repeatedly made about US military aid and support for Israel . \nMarch 5th , 2011 1:38 pm ET John A ur such a smart ass . . \nI bet u eat books for breakfast . \nhaha Miriam , obviously your not good with economics . \nAmerican loans paid to Israel at preferential rates , are given as a lump sum at the beginning of each year . \nThis allows Israel to gain interest which would normally benefit American tax payers . \nNot to mention the long history of fuel subsidies etc. . . \nNot to mention all the American businesses which set up in Israel to create Israeli jobs and not American jobs . \nMost of Israels tech industry is an off shoot of American business with guaranteed American orders and free technology transfers . \nOrders given to Israel which could have been given to American businesses and American workers . \nYou think that is n't economic aid ?? Clearly this does n't even include the free gift of 3 billion every year on military aid . \nMiriam , as Hilary Clinton said the USA has lost the information war . \nBecause everyone knows the USA and her ally Israel lie , lie and lie some more . \nMarc , Is the term `` smart '' an insult in America ? \nThat would explain a lot hahaha March 7th , 2011 5:40 am ET Obama is afraid of kadafi , am a nigerian when i was in lybian 7yrs ago 3 of my friends where hang to death coldely by lybian authority while because they were found guilty by toasting a girl at noon in the aftenoon , this man kadafi need to be naked nd floog him mercilessly ... You think a new era of democracy and public good will start with a merciless flogging ? \nPerhaps you should go back to your cave and return to this blog after you have had time to evolve ... Lets say in another 2000 years ... Loan guarantees are not grants and no US funds are transferred to Israel . \nThere is absolutely no effect on US domestic programs and they have no impact on US taxpayers , unless Israel defaults which it has never done . \nThe only effect on the US is the conditional increased expenditure by Israel in the US . \nIt is widely agreed that the loan guarantees are no longer needed by Israel and that their continuation is probably a US measure designed to be able to pressure Israel with conditions . \nSince this is a ME blog , it would be interesting if you would occasionally enlighten us about US and EU aid , loans , grants , guarantees etc etc to all the other countries in the region . \nWe would all be shocked at the tax-payers ' cost in supporting the anti-democratic , dictatorial , autocratic , oil-controlling , terror-supporting , already wealthy regimes . \nIts really hard to believe you cant already understand . \nBut imagine you went to a bank , without any security and was offered a 3 billion dollars loan and at a cheaper interest rate than everyone else . \nThe loan is also repeated every year in lump sum which you can place in your bank to invest and make more money from . \nAre you not intelligent enough to exploit this unique privilege ? \nMiriam , its time that you start to be honest with yourself . \nIts not that everyone who disagrees with you is wrong . \nIts not that you are a horrible person . \nIts simply you have not been blessed the basic intelligence needed to understand the world you live in . \nProbably you are great at sport , art or music . \nBut leave economics , law , business , politics to others , as clearly these subjects far , far are beyond you . \nMarch 9th , 2011 3:17 pm ET And Miriam , you rightly state Israel is not the only country receiving aid in the middle east . \nFor example , America funded the dictator Mubarak if Mubarak agreed to close the Gaza boarder and kiss Israels behind . \nAmerica also funds the Saudi dictatorship , if they agree to send oil to Israel and kiss Israels behind . \nAll the aid sent to the region is either to directly fund lazy Israels existence or to buy friends in the region for anti social Israel . \nDo you think the people of Egypt benefited from the billions sent to arm the dictator Mubarak . \nWas that money sent to create freedom and democracy ? \nOr was it even more American tax payers money being used to prop up illegitimate allies for the criminal state of Israel ? \nIn return Israel remains as Americas key attack threat to the oil regions . \nIf the Saudi 's do n't do what America wants , the CIA can let a car bomb of in Jerusalem , blame the Arabs and give Israel the green light to invade in supposed retaliation . \nThats all the Jews are being used for in the middle east . \nCome on , how many times has Israel invaded its neighbors and for how many decades has Israel been unable to find a peaceful solution . \nEven the entire Arab league offered peace and recognition of Israel , if it withdrew to its internationally recognized boarders of 1967 . \nBup there is no way Israel wants peace , theres no way America will allow peace . \nIsrael is there to be Americas out of control rottweiler and use terror to manipulate middle east politics . \nThe games up Miriam . \nIts all becoming to obvious . \nThe stars and stripes fly over Iraq . \nAmerica threaten war with Iran , they prop up most other regions with dictators who receive instructions from Washington . \nAmerica is the only nation that supports Israel at the UN . \nThe picture is clear . \nIsrael has nothing to do with Judaism or any other religion . \nIsrael is just one of several American strategies to destabilize the middle easter and control its oil . \nThere never were any `` internationally recognized 1967 borders '' . \nThere were recognized 1949 Armistice Lines , accepted by Israel but subsequently rejected by Arabs , confirmed by their repeated attacks across those lines preceding the 1967 war . \nIn fact it was internationally recognized that those lines were never to become borders since they were indefensible and had no political or legal significance . \nPeace agreements with Jordan and Egypt were based on those facts and Palestinian negotiators are fully aware of those facts but that does n't stop them deceiving others with their rhetoric . \nThe Jewish Agency\\/Israel accepted all UN resolutions concerning partition and negotiation , the same resolutions rejected by some or all of the Arabs . \nFor example , the three `` No 's '' of the Arab League in Khartoum , no peace , no negotiation , no recognition . \nGo ahead propagating lies , but everyone should know that that 's what they are . \nThe world may not like Khadafi , but he 's the only moslem in the middle east that does n't wait for `` consensus '' or look over his shoulder to see if he has backing or whatever . \nThe SOB is one smart north african that will not hesitate to slaughter several thousand fellow moslems to maintain his way of life , and that of his buddies . \nTrust me , after the smoke settles and the other moslem nations do NOTHING , the sand will swallow up the mass graves of the few thousand brave that opposed him . \nAmazingly , the `` great '' moslem leader , Egypt will sit on its hands and show the world that islam is a do nothing , cowardly theology that is only capable of killing those that are less capable of a good fight . \nHowever many moslems this madman kills ... IT 'S A DAMN GOOD START !!! March 21st , 2011 9:20 am ET We are broke , the US is in shambles and we are now ramping up yet another middle east war ? \nThis is crazy and misdirected . \nNo more wars take care of US business and your own people none of these other country help us in our own civil war . . \nIts time to STAND AS ONE AND TAKE BACK OUR GOVERMENT AND STOP THE BULLYING . . \nIf they want to kill each other then so be it . \nI do not want to see my tax dollars going to these other countrys that do NOT GIVE A CRAP ABOUT U. . . \nHOW MUCH WILL YOU GUYS TAKE BEFOR YOU STAND UP FOR YOURSELFES AND YOUR KIDS . . \nREMEMBER THIS OUR GOVERMENT HAS KILLED ITS OWN PEOPLE AND NO ONE WAS THERE TO HELP US ...

{"id": "23", "time": "2011-02-24", "text": "By the CNN Wire Staff At the Libya , Egypt border The Department of State recommended Thursday that any U.S. citizens in Libya `` depart immediately due to the potential for ongoing unrest . '' \nIt noted that `` violent clashes between protesters and security forces continue throughout Libya , including in Tripoli '' and warned that `` spontaneous demonstrations , violence , and looting are possible throughout the next several days . '' \nThe department ordered all Embassy family members and non-emergency personnel to leave the country . \nThere were roughly 6,000 Americans in Libya . \nA ferry chartered by the United States to evacuate citizens from Libya is expected to depart within the `` next several hours , '' State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said Thursday afternoon . \nCrowley told reporters the exact timing of the ship 's departure depends on the weather . \nA total of 285 people are safely on board , Crowley said . \nThe vessel can hold up to 575 people . \nThe ship is carrying 167 U.S. citizens , including 40 nonessential embassy staff and family , as well as 118 third-country nationals . \nThe State Department had one charter plane scheduled to land Thursday in Tripoli , but it had to be canceled because of the weather , according to a senior U.S. official . \n`` We hope to get one plane in tomorrow -LRB- Friday -RRB- , '' the official said . \nOn Tuesday , the Libyan government refused permission for a U.S. charter sent to fly out Americans to land in Tripoli . \nThe U.S. did not get permission because the `` system is under stress , '' not necessarily because the Libyan government was deliberately trying to stop flights , the official said . \nAn Airbus A310 belonging to the French air force made a flight to the central Libyan city of Sabha and returned to Paris with 165 French nationals Thursday , the Defense Ministry said . \nIndia plans to evacuate its citizens from Libya by air and sea . \nGovernment officials said they have chartered a ferry with the capacity to seat 1,200 people . \nThe ship will reach Benghazi by Saturday and is expected to arrive in Egypt with the evacuees by Tuesday . \nBritain 's Foreign & Commonwealth Office reported helping more than 350 British nationals and 25 people from other countries depart Libya Thursday . \nThe office reported receiving on Thursday more than 1,000 calls from British nationals seeking to leave Libya . \nFive flights have departed or were set to depart Thursday from Tripoli . \nMore flights were to be arranged for Friday as necessary . \nThe HMS Cumberland departed Benghazi carrying 207 passengers , about 68 of them British . \nIt was slated to arrive in Valletta , Malta on Friday . \nAnother 25 British nationals were aboard the U.S. ferry in Tripoli harbor . \nThe Canadian foreign affairs office said a flight chartered by the government will leave Tripoli for Rome on Thursday . \n`` All Canadian citizens wishing to leave Libya on this flight should arrive at the airport in Tripoli by 10 a.m. on Thursday and wait in the left side of the parking lot located in front of the airport , '' the office said . \nOver the past few days , China has evacuated 12,000 of the tens of thousands of Chinese nationals in Libya , Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Song Tao said Friday , according to the state-run Xinhua News Agency . \nMost of them are employees of Chinese companies with businesses in Libya . \nMany have been taken to neighboring countries including Greece , Egypt and Tunisia by ocean liners , airplanes or coaches , according to the Foreign Ministry . \nThe president 's office is sending an EgyptAir plane to Tripoli on Thursday to evacuate 260 workers and their families . \nSouth Korean officials are considering chartering more planes as well as moving people by land and sea routes . \nThere are nearly 1,400 South Koreans in Libya , working at almost 300 building sites . \nEgyptian authorities have asked EgyptAir to operate evacuation flights of Egyptian nationals from Tripoli , according to EgyNews , the official state-run website . \nTwo military planes have also been sent , the assistant foreign minister for expatriates told Egyptian TV , and there are ongoing efforts to send ferries to ports in Tripoli and Benghazi . \nThe first flight carrying Nigerian nationals out of Libya will leave Thursday , according to a spokesman for Nigeria 's National Emergency Management Agency . \nOfficials are n't sure how many people will need flights but say any necessary flights will be organized . \nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agreed to allow 300 Palestinaian to enter the Palestinian territories from Libya on humanitarian grounds , according to a statement from his office . \nThe request was made by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas . \nTwo ferry boats carrying more than 3,000 Turks left Benghazi early Wednesday morning , the Turkish Foreign Ministry said . \nTwo more ferry boats -- each capable of carrying 1,200 people -- are headed to the North African nation . \nA third ferry is expected to arrive in Benghazi on Thursday . \nThe boats will carry food and medical supplies for Libyans as demanded by the Turkish prime minister , the ministry said . \nThe ministry added that in addition to the daily scheduled flights by Turkish Airlines to Tripoli , seven more planes are on standby in case they are permitted to fly to Benghazi airport or make additional flights to Tripoli . \nSaudi Arabia said it sent a special passenger plane to Tripoli on Wednesday morning . \nThe Syrian Arab News Agency said the country is ready to launch an `` unlimited number of flights if necessary .

{"id": "386", "time": "2011-06-14", "text": "NATO can not verify rebel claims that Gadhafi may be hiding rockets at the UNESCO World Heritage site of Leptis Magna . \nThe president of South Africa lashed out Tuesday at NATO 's enforcement of the U.N. resolution authorizing the organization to act to protect innocent civilians threatened by Libya 's civil war . \n`` We strongly believe that the resolution is being abused for regime change , political assassinations and foreign military occupation , '' said Jacob Zuma at a budget vote debate before the National Assembly in Cape Town . \n`` These actions undermine the efforts of the African Union in finding solutions to the problems facing its member states , '' he said in an appeal that called on all parties to respect international humanitarian law and called further for reform of the U.N. Security Council . \nWhen the council adopted the resolution in March , it was backed by the Arab League and supported by African countries in the council . \nBut Zuma said NATO 's actions have exceeded the authority that the resolution granted . \nArab Spring unrest , country by country `` We have spoken out against the misuse of the good intentions in Resolution 1973 , '' said Zuma , who led two African Union delegations to Libya , where he met with leader Moammar Gadhafi in failed attempts to broker a cease-fire . \nUnlike some other world leaders , Zuma has not called for the longtime leader to step down . \nNeither has Zuma 's African National Congress party nor the African Union , which he was representing and which Gadhafi once led . \nThe AU also has criticized the NATO airstrikes . \nIn April , Zuma led an AU delegation to Tripoli , Libya 's capital , where hopes were raised briefly when it was announced that Gadhafi had agreed , in principle , to the AU 's `` road map '' proposal for peace . \nBut Gadhafi continued his attacks and the Libyan opposition rejected the proposal because it did not meet its demand that he give up the power he has held for 42 years . \nU.S. officials and those of some other countries have called for Gadhafi to step down . \nSeparately , NATO refused to say Tuesday whether it would bomb ancient Roman ruins in Libya if it knew Gadhafi was hiding military equipment there . \nTime magazine gallery : Libya 's stunning Roman ruins `` We will strike military vehicles , military forces , military equipment or military infrastructure that threaten Libyan civilians as necessary , '' a NATO official in Naples , Italy , said , declining to give his name in discussing internal NATO deliberations . \n"}
{"id": "255", "time": "2011-02-23", "text": "By the CNN Wire Staff Report : Pilot refused to bomb , crashes Italy 's foreign minister says Libyan death toll may be 1,000 The State Department says the U.S. considers sanctions Pilot and co-pilot eject , refusing bombing orders , a newspaper reports Are you there ? \nShare your photos and videos with CNN iReport . \nBenghazi , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Even as Moammar Gadhafi called on the military to crack down on anti-government protesters , reports emerged Wednesday that the Libyan leader was facing growing international and domestic opposition , including from his own military . \nAn opposition figure told CNN that a pilot who had been ordered to bomb oil fields southwest of Benghazi refused to do so and instead ejected from the plane . \nCiting military sources , the Libyan newspaper Quryna reported that the two people aboard -- the pilot and co-pilot -- parachuted out and that the plane then crashed into an uninhabited area west of Ajdabiya , 160 kilometers -LRB- 100 miles -RRB- southwest of Benghazi . \nQuryna itself is a sign of the changes sweeping through Libya . \nWhen protests began last week , it carried regime propaganda . \nBut it later reported on the protests and casualty figures . \nCNN could not confirm reports for many areas in Libya . \nThe Libyan government maintains tight control on communications and has not responded to repeated requests from CNN for access to the country . \nCNN has interviewed numerous witnesses by phone . \nA Libyan Arab Airlines plane was denied permission to land in Malta on Wednesday , Maltese government sources said . \nPermission was denied for `` clearance reasons , '' because officials did not know who was on board , the sources said . \nGadhafi vows to stay as regime crumbles Eastern Libya slips from Gadhafi 's grip Eastern Libyan : I 'm a free man Libya Interior Minister joins revolution Meanwhile , Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini characterized the situation as a civil war , `` with the authorities of the capital ordering attacks against the same Libyan people -- bombings and acts of unprecedented violence . '' \nIn a speech to the Italian Senate , Frattini said , `` Unconfirmed reports spoke of 1,000 deaths ; other sources have given even higher figures . '' \nHe said the claim from official sources that put the total number of deaths nationwide at 200 to 300 deaths `` frankly lacks credibility . '' \nThe head of the largest trauma hospital in Benghazi told CNN on Wednesday that 202 people have been confirmed dead in the city since protests began last week . \nThe opposition now controls Benghazi and much of the rest of eastern Libya . \nOn Wednesday , the ninth day of protests , Gadhafi faced more defections from within his regime and new international pressure to halt military actions against demonstrators . \nUncertainty surrounded the whereabouts of one prominent defector . \nAbdul Fattah Younis al Abidi , the country 's interior minister , told CNN Wednesday in a telephone interview that he had resigned Monday and was supporting the opposition after hearing that 300 unarmed civilians had been killed in Benghazi . \n`` Gadhafi told me he was planning on using airplanes against the people in Benghazi and I told him that he will have thousands of people killed if he does that , '' al Abidi said . \nHe accused Gadhafi of planning to attack civilians on a wide scale but predicted that protesters would emerge victorious in `` days or hours . '' \nBut hours after that interview , the Libyan government announced Wednesday that the former interior minister had been kidnapped . \nState media reported that `` gangs '' had abducted him in Benghazi . \nBut Benghazi , now solidly in the camp of the protesters , was peaceful Wednesday . \nThe only shooting that could be heard was celebratory gunfire . \nCrowds cheered as international journalists drove through the city , thanked them for arriving and threw them candy . \nAbsent Gadhafi 's influence , residents formed ad hoc committees to take over the business of running the city , ensuring that hospitals were adequately staffed and supplied , banks were protected , electricity was flowing and garbage was picked up . \nThey also formed a security force to defend the city in the event that forces loyal to Gadhafi were to attack . \nGadhafi : Profile of a dictator Can Gadhafi survive ? \nTwo people to watch Gadhafi : ' I will be a martyr ' Libyan protests threaten oil prices One member of the ad hoc government said forces here have been in telephone contact with tribes in the west of the country , many of whom remained loyal to Gadhafi , and have tried to persuade them to reject him . \nIn New York , U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon left no doubt about where the world body stands on Libya . \n`` The reported nature and scale of the attacks on civilians are egregious violations of international humanitarian and human rights law , '' he told reporters . \n`` I condemn them loudly and without qualification . \nThose responsible must be held accountable in courts of law . '' \nHe noted that the Security Council and the League of Arab States on Tuesday each issued strong statements on the matter . \n`` The world has spoken with one voice , '' he said . \n`` The government of Libya must meet its responsibility to protect its people . '' \nBan added that he was sending his senior advisers to the region . \nIn Washington , President Barack Obama said the United States condemns the use of violence . \n`` The suffering and bloodshed is outrageous and it is unacceptable , '' he told reporters as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stood beside him . \nLibya `` must be held accountable '' for its failure to meet its responsibilities , he said , adding , `` The entire world is watching . '' \nHe said he was sending Clinton to Geneva for international meetings about Libya . \nThe United States is considering a range of tools to pressure Libya to end the violence and respect the rights of its people , U.S. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said Wednesday . \n`` That certainly includes sanctions that could be imposed either bilaterally or multilaterally , '' Crowley said . \nPeru and Botswana announced they were breaking diplomatic ties with Libya . \nPeruvian President Alan Garcia said his country suspended diplomatic relations after condemning `` the repression unleashed by Gadhafi . '' \nBotswana 's foreign affairs ministry said in a statement that it was joining the international community , `` which is calling for action to be taken against those persons who have committed crimes against humanity in the continuing conflict in Libya and hopes that such persons shall be referred to the International Criminal Court to account for their deeds . '' \nBut ICC Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo noted that Libya is not a party to the Rome Statute , which set up the court . \n`` Intervention by the ICC on the alleged crimes committed in Libya can occur only if the Libyan authorities accept the jurisdiction of the court , '' his statement said . \n`` In the absence of such step , the United Nations Security Council can decide to refer the situation to the court . \nThe Office of the Prosecutor will act only after either decision is taken . '' \nFrench President Nicolas Sarkozy called for prompt European Union sanctions against Libya on Wednesday , such as `` a ban on access to EU territory and financial monitoring . '' \nResidents in the Libyan capital of Tripoli heard sporadic gunshots overnight , a resident said Wednesday . \nBy daybreak , the main roads in the city had been `` cleaned off as if nothing happened , '' she said . \nMore checkpoints have been set up , especially near the city center , restricting residents ' movements , she said . \nAnd a food shortage is getting worse , she said . \nWhen her family tried Wednesday morning to buy bread , they found the bakeries were closed . \nPolice cars and downed trees blocked many of the roads in the neighborhoods , and security officials were not allowing pictures to be taken . \nWitnesses reported seeing about 10 burned-out civilian cars and bodies lying in the streets . \nMany of the streets were stained with blood , a witness said . \nIn Tripoli 's Dahra neighborhood , people driving white vans cleared away makeshift barricades , a witness said . \nWednesday evening , planes circled overhead and shots were fired , though it was n't clear whether the shots were coming from the air or the ground , a witness said . \nThe streets were largely deserted , but one man could be heard in the street screaming in Arabic , `` There is no God but Allah and Mohammed is his prophet ! '' \n-- a liturgical slogan often invoked by Muslims in challenging situations , the witness said . \nWitnesses said security forces increased their presence after Gadhafi defended his regime in a defiant speech Tuesday . \nHe vowed to die a `` martyr '' and blamed the unrest on `` rats '' who are `` agents '' of foreign intelligence services . \nHe warned that people found to be cooperating with outside forces fomenting discord and those who carry weapons against the country will be executed . \nA government spokesman blamed U.S. and Israeli intelligence operatives for the unrest . \n`` We will get rid of them , in collaboration with our people in the eastern province , '' he said . \nReferring to reports that the military had attacked civilians , the spokesman said , `` We have reports and evidence they are not using arms unless against those who attacked the barracks . '' \nThe government version of events differed markedly from what witnesses reported , including helicopter gunships firing into crowds of protesters . \nThose caught up in the unrest include asylum seekers and refugees , the U.N. refugee agency said , as it urged neighboring countries not to turn them away . \nSpeaking to reporters in Geneva , Switzerland , the chief spokeswoman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said she had received troubling reports about their plight . \n`` A journalist has passed information to us from Somalis in Tripoli who say they are being hunted on suspicion of being mercenaries , '' Melissa Fleming said . \n`` He says they feel trapped and are frightened to go out , even though there is little or no food at home . '' \nThe U.N. refugee agency praised Tunisia and Egypt for `` positive indications '' that they will keep their borders open to people fleeing Libya . \nThe agency 's staff is working at the Tunisian border to monitor the situation and identify `` vulnerable individuals for whom immediate assistance is needed -- such as children without parents , women with children , and the elderly , '' the agency said in a statement . \nAn English-speaking Egyptian fleeing Libya told CNN of systematic destruction of cell phone cards and cell phone memory chips at checkpoints on the road to the border with Tunisia . \nHe also reported thousands of people gathering at the Tripoli airport , both inside and outside . \nMeanwhile , the United Nations terminated Gadhafi 's daughter 's stint as a goodwill ambassador for the U.N.

{"id": "355", "time": "2011-06-24", "text": "As anyone who reads my blog probably knows , I have been a critic of the U.S. military involvement in Libya from the beginning -LRB- see some of my writings on the topic here , here , here , here , here , and here ; and podcasts here , here , and here -RRB- . \nAs I ve watched the Libyan adventure unfold , I ve been particularly interested by the myriad justifications that proponents have offered for intervention . \nThe predominant reason given and indeed authorized in UN Security Council Resolution 1973 has been to protect civilians and civilian populated areas under threat of attack . \nBeyond this narrow mandate , however , an additional set of overlapping reasons have been put forth , before and since the intervention began on March 19 . \nBelow are but five of the more prominent secondary justifications put forth by Obama administration officials , congressional members , pundits , and policy analysts . \nOn the second day of the bombing campaign , cruise missiles were launched into Moammar Gadhafi 's Bab al-Azizia compound in Tripoli . \nThe stated military objective was to disrupt the command and control of loyalist forces , but the immediate intention was to kill Gadhafi in an attempt to quickly resolve the civil war . \nThe day prior , British defense minister Liam Fox was asked if Gadhafi was a legitimate target , and responded that attacking the Libyan leader would potentially be a possibility . \nSince then , while NATO officials emphasize that it does not intentionally target specific individuals , the alliance has routinely bombed Gadhafi 's suspected residences , including one attack that reportedly killed the Libyan leader s son and three of his grandchildren . \nSince then , the calls for regime change through a targeted killing have only increased . \nFive weeks into the NATO-led bombing campaign , Senator Lindsey Graham demanded that the alliance cut the head of the snake off , go to Tripoli , start bombing -LRB- Gadhafi 's -RRB- inner circle . \nSenator John McCain further lamented that while President Obama was limiting America s military mission to achieve primarily humanitarian objectives , the fact is that we need to take -LRB- Gadhafi -RRB- out . \nFoggy Bottom , apparently , wants Gadhafi deposed but only of his own volition . \nLast week , when presented with several potential diplomatic solutions to resolving the civil war , a State Department spokesperson responded that the only option that the United States was willing to entertain was Gadhafi stepping down from power . \nThus , beyond the initial stated military mission of protecting civilians , the only acceptable outcome of the intervention has become the removal of Gadhafi from power , with the bombing campaign continuing until whenever that objective is achieved . \nSending a Message to Other Dictators The Libyan uprising and subsequent civil war occurred within the broader context of the Arab Spring that began in neighboring Tunisia , and has swept across North Africa into the Middle East . \nIt was believed by many that the demonstration effect of intervening to attempt to stop the brutal repression used by the Gadhafi regime would deter other dictators from doing likewise . \nAs the events in Yemen , Bahrain , Syria , and even Libya have demonstrated , attempting to use force for second-order psychological effects is a fool s errand , and should not be included as a justification for military intervention in the first place . \nNevertheless , in the absence of intervention in Libya s civil war , President Obama warned in his March 28 address to the nation that the democratic impulses would be eclipsed by the darkest form of dictatorship , as repressive leaders concluded that violence is the best strategy to cling to power ; former State Department official , Anne Marie Slaughter , contended that if Colonel Gadhafi wins , regimes across the region will conclude that force is the way to answer protests ; Nicholas Kristof , New York Times columnist , claimed that If not for this intervention the message would have gone out to all dictators that ruthlessness works ; former British Prime Minister Tony Blair wrote , We would send a signal of Western impotence in a region that analyzes such signals keenly ; and Senator John Kerry believed that a military intervention in Libya sends a critical signal to other leaders in the region : They can not automatically assume they can resort to large-scale violence to put down legitimate demands for reform without consequences . \nSupporting the Libyan Rebels While the Libyan rebels have been unable to remove Gadhafi from power , its self-appointed leadership group the Transitional National Council -LRB- TNC -RRB- has succeeded at courting western support since its founding on March 5 . \nUtilizing the skills of multi-national public relations firms like the Harbour Group and Bell Pottinger , the TNC has consistently portrayed itself as inclusive , western-educated , committed to democratic principles , and opposed to any Islamist influences . \nThe TNC s official website motto : Freedom . \nDemocracy provides upbeat messages about the progress of the war , and extensive coverage of every foreign official who tours Benghazi . \nAfter one such visit in mid-May , Senator John McCain vouched for the rebel leadership , stating : Their Prime Minister got a doctorate at the University of Pittsburgh . \nTheir Finance Minister was recently teaching economics in Seattle others are lawyers , doctors , women activists . \nSimilarly , after British Foreign Secretary William Hague held talks with the TNC in the rebel-held capital in early June , he declared : These people at the top of this organization are genuine believers in democracy and the rule of law . \nIt is quite inspiring . \nAfter another early June visit to Benghazi , Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Jeffrey Feltman wrote of being profoundly impressed by everyone he encountered , and drew a vivid picture for how the military intervention in Libya was transforming America s image in the Arab world : Imagine walking in the main square of a teeming Arab city and having people wave the American flag , clamor for photographs with a visiting American official , and celebrate the United States as both savior and model . \nRepaying European Support in Afghanistan Reports of the White House debate over whether to join the Paris and London-led war party show that the Obama administration has been a reluctant participant from the start . \nOne reason that the administration overcame its reluctance was to maintain the limited support that European NATO allies have provided to the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan . \nTo repay them for their cooperation in the Hindu-Kush , the United States was compelled to support those European allies in North Africa . \nIn explaining why the United States was intervening in a country that was not a vital interest , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton admitted in late March : We asked our allies , our NATO allies , to go into Afghanistan with us ten years ago . \nThey have been there and a lot of them have been there despite the fact they were not attacked They stuck with us . \nWhen it comes to Libya , we started hearing from the U.K. , France , Italy , other of our NATO allies . \nThis was in their vital national interests . \nThis rationale has endured , with Secretary Gates acknowledging last week : What was going on in Libya was considered a vital interest by some of our closest allies . \nThose are the same allies that have come to our support and assistance in Afghanistan . \nAnd so it seems to me the kind of limited measured role that the president decided on in support of our allies , who did consider it a vital interest , is a legitimate way to look at this problem . \nOr , as Senators Joe Lieberman and Marco Rubio wrote yesterday : American disengagement would also inflict irreparable damage on the NATO alliance Having walked out on our European allies in the middle of a battle , we can expect them to do the same to us in Afghanistan . \nIt Will Be a Piece of Cake A final proposition put forward by intervention proponents was that , ultimately , it would not be very hard to achieve the desired end state . \nWhether based on recent technological advances or the fragile nature of loyalist security forces , such best-case scenario thinking was evident on both sides of the Atlantic . \nLibya s rebels encouraged the Western assumption that Gadhafi could be deposed with ease . \nOne purported spokesperson for the rebels Transitional National Council claimed on March 13 , We are capable of controlling all of Libya , but only after the no-fly zone is imposed . \nThe United States , according to Obama , would lead with days , not weeks of military action , thus shaping the conditions for the international community to act together . \nWhite House spokesperson , Jay Carney , later clarified America s role to be a time-limited , scope-limited military action , in concert with our international partners . \nMy Council on Foreign Relations colleague Elliot Abrams asserted that only a small amount of effort -LRB- is -RRB- needed from the United States to ensure that Gadhafi is defeated . \nThe former U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Merrill McPeak , discussing the imposition of a no-fly zone over Libya , contended that it would change their calculation of who might come out on top . \nJust the mere announcement of this might have an impact . \nMeanwhile , the French philosopher Bernard Henri Levy , who was instrumental in flying Libyan rebel leaders to Paris to meet with French President Nicolas Sarkozy , made the implausible claim that If the decision had been made to intervene five or six days earlier , bombing three airports would have been sufficient . \nSo Why Does This Matter ? \nEvery time the United States considers the use of military force , proponents and opponents offer a smattering of justifications for why it should or should not happen . \nOf course , people have varying vantage points and biases , which leads different arguments to be convincing to different audiences . \nThis is to be expected in a democracy . \nBut presidents do not have the luxury of finding a lot of arguments convincing enough . \nWhen presidents authorize a military action , they must have a clear objective in mind . \nWithout a singular , defined goal , policymakers can not appropriately match means and ends , which increases the likelihood of failure . \nThe United States will assuredly use military force against another state in the future , whether to attempt to protect civilian populations , destroy threatening WMD or ballistic missile capabilities , or degrade assets associated with an adversarial regime . \nWhen the debates over such interventions unfurl , take the time to sift and winnow through each of the justifications provided by government officials and pundits . \nThen decide for yourself if these arguments either individually , or in some cluster rise to the level of requiring the use of the American military . \nIn the case of Libya , there was one overarching rationale provided the protection of civilians yet the initial intervention and the now ninety-seven day bombing campaign has been about so much more . \nI 'm sick and tired of ppl acting like it s ok for us to sit on the sidelines when innocent ppl are being tortured and rapped . \nHas anyone seen the video of the women being sodomized by a broom stick ?!?!?!?!?! Plus it helps that Libya sits on a lake of oil -LRB- uuughh duh we really need it -RRB- . \nThese are the same ppl that thought we could negotiate with Hitler . \nAnd a Hitler and Ghadafi comparison is accurate and not over reaching here , unlike the GW and Obama comparisons . \nAnytime ppl ask for freedom and are lucky to get shot instead of raped and tortured , and the country has a financial means to lift itself from oppression of course we should step in !!!!!

{"id": "69", "time": "2011-06-24", "text": "House rejects bill that would have cut funding for U.S. offensive operations in Libya The House also has rejected a measure expressing support for the Libya mission House members say the administration has violated the 1973 War Powers Resolution Administration : Resolution not violated because the U.S. is n't technically engaged in hostilities Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Republican-controlled House of Representatives delivered a mixed message on America 's role in the NATO-led Libya campaign Friday , opposing a resolution expressing support for the war while also voting down a bill restricting American involvement in the conflict . \nThe first measure -- similar to legislation introduced in the Senate by Sen. John Kerry , D-Massachusetts , and Sen. John McCain , R-Arizona -- was backed by the White House . \nIt was defeated 123-295 , with Republicans overwhelmingly opposing the measure and Democrats voting more narrowly in favor of it . \nThe second measure was strongly supported by House Speaker John Boehner , R-Ohio , and other top GOP leaders . \nIt was defeated 180-238 , with Democrats largely voting no as Republicans voted yes by a slimmer margin . \nIn short , the House appeared unable to speak with clarity on President Barack Obama 's controversial effort to oust Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi . \nWhite House press secretary Jay Carney expressed disappointment in the first House vote , and told reporters the `` writing is on the wall '' for Gadhafi . \n`` Now is not the time to let up , '' he said . \nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton said she was `` gratified that the House has decisively rejected efforts to limit funding for the NATO mission . '' \nDebate on U.S. involvement in Libya White House defends actions in Libya Protesting for , against Gadhafi in Libya Rape as a weapon of war `` I am pleased that a very important statement was made today by the House , on a bipartisan basis , that recognizes the need for us to continue this important mission , '' she added . \nAsked to explain the relatively rare defeat for the House leadership on the second vote , Boehner only offered a one-word reply : `` nothing . '' \nA GOP leadership aide , however , told CNN there was last-minute concern among some Republican members that a vote to restrict certain forms of U.S. involvement in the NATO mission could have been interpreted as an inherent authorization of other types of force . \n`` Once you de-facto -LRB- approve -RRB- it ... then the president can run with it , '' said Rep. Scott Garrett , R-New Jersey , who opposed both measures . \n`` What we 're trying to do here is have our cake and eat it too . \nWe 're trying to split it in half by declaring a partial war and then telling -LRB- Obama -RRB- how he is going to be commander-in-chief . '' \n`` I do n't think you can do that in a bill , '' Garrett said . \n`` The proper resolution would say we should not be over there , -LRB- and -RRB- we are withholding all funds for all military activity , period . '' \nRep. Gerry Connolly , D-Virginia , who backed the support resolution while opposing the bill restricting involvement , said he was n't lobbied by the White House until Friday morning . \n`` I think moving forward , a lesson -LRB- about administration outreach -RRB- has been learned here , '' he said . \nMuch of the House 's disapproval of the Libya campaign has been fueled by a belief that Obama failed to sufficiently consult with Congress before committing to military engagement . \nSpecifically , representatives from both political parties say the administration has violated the 1973 War Powers Resolution , which gives the president 60 days to get congressional approval for sending U.S. forces to war , followed by a 30-day extension to end hostilities . \nThe combined 90-day period ended last Sunday . \nSupport for the war has also been further shaken by evidence of several noncombatant deaths caused by recent NATO airstrikes . \nThe White House says Obama did n't need congressional authorization because U.S. forces are playing only a supporting role in Libya and have n't engaged in what the law defines as hostilities . \nThe president , however , personally overruled contrary legal opinions put forward by both the Pentagon and the Justice Department 's Office of Legal Counsel , according to a report published Saturday in The New York Times . \nBoehner said during Friday 's debate on the House floor that Obama 's authority under the Constitution `` does not free the president from accountability to the American people , this Congress or the rule of law . '' \nThe War Powers Resolution `` is the law of the land and simply can not be ignored , '' he said . \nThe GOP-sponsored bill is necessary to `` defend the constitutional authority of the legislature '' and provides `` much-needed accountability . '' \nSome Democrats , however , blasted Republicans , accusing them of playing politics with what they called a critical foreign policy priority . \n`` This was not handled right '' by the White House , said Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee , D-Texas . \nBut the House votes are `` nothing but politics , '' and `` I do n't want to abandon my friends in the Arab states who are now struggling for democracy . '' \nDefense Secretary Robert Gates said Thursday it would be a mistake for Congress to cut funding for U.S. military operations in Libya . \n`` I think , once we have our forces engaged , to deny them funding would be a mistake , '' Gates told PBS News . \nKey American allies -- especially the British , the French and the Italians -- consider Libya a vital interest , and `` our alliance with them is a vital interest for us , '' he said , citing their efforts in Afghanistan . \nGates insisted that progress has been made toward the U.S. goal of ousting Gadhafi . \n`` Based on everything we see , the government gets shakier by the day , '' Gates said . \n`` His forces have been significantly diminished . \nThe opposition is expanding the areas under their control .

'' \nEx-Interior Minister Abdul Fattah Younis al Abidi told CNN that he resigned Monday after hearing that some 300 unarmed civilians had been killed in Benghazi during the prior two to three days . \nHe accused Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi of planning to attack civilians on a wide scale . \n`` Gadhafi told me he was planning on using airplanes against the people in Benghazi , and I told him that he will have thousands of people killed if he does that , '' Abidi said in an Arabic-language telephone interview conducted Wednesday . \nAbidi said he now supports the people and the revolution . \nHe called Gadhafi `` a stubborn man '' who will not give up . \n`` He will either commit suicide or he will get killed , '' said Abidi , who said he has known him since 1964 . \nAbidi predicted the revolution will succeed `` in a matter of days or hours , '' and he called on Libyan security forces `` to join the people in the intifada . '' \nAlready , he said , `` many members '' of the security forces had defected , including those in the capital , Tripoli . \nHe said the entire eastern part of the country is no longer under Gadhafi 's control and that security forces there have orders to never open fire on the people unless forced to do so in self-defense . \nTwo people to watch Zakaria : ' I thought he was on drugs ' UN wants end to Libyan violence Gadhafi told me he was planning on using airplanes against the people in Benghazi -- Abdul Fattah Younis al Abidi , now ex-interior minister The Libyan ambassador to the United States , Ali Aujali , also called for Gadhafi to resign , joining a chorus of Libyan officials , including the deputy ambassador to the United Nations , who say they now work for the Libyan people , not for Gadhafi . \nAmong them was the Libyan ambassador to Bangladesh , A.H. Elimam , who resigned to side with pro-democracy protesters , said BSS , the official news agency of Bangladesh , citing a Foreign Ministry official Tuesday . \nTheir announcements came eight days into protests that have cost Gadhafi control of eastern Libya and the support of other prominent Libyan officials worldwide and hours after Gadhafi delivered a defiant , rambling speech Tuesday , refusing calls to step down . \n`` This is my country , the country of my grandfathers , '' Gadhafi said in remarks carried live on Libyan state television . \nHe vowed to die `` a martyr '' in his country . \nBlaming the unrest on `` rats '' who are `` agents '' of foreign intelligence services , Gadhafi said people found to be cooperating with outside forces fomenting discord and those who carry weapons against the country will be executed . \nThe 68-year-old leader , who has been in power for nearly 42 years , spoke from a compound that U.S. warplanes bombed in 1986 , the Jamahiriya News Agency of Libya reported . \nThe United States attacked the compound after implicating Libya in a discotheque bombing in West Berlin that resulted in the deaths of two U.S. service members . \nLibyan state TV described the crowds on the streets who were watching Gadhafi 's speech as his supporters ; an opposition leader said they had been dragged onto the streets . \nSome students at Tripoli 's Academy of Graduate Studies were offered free master 's degrees if they joined Gadhafi supporters in Green Square , a source said . \nSome people in Tripoli were offered money to put pictures of Gadhafi on their cars and go to Green Square , the source said . \nMoammar Gadhafi : An iron grip on Libya Will the military continue to comply ? \nA government spokesman , speaking on television , said Libyans were returning to their usual routine . \n`` A sense of normalcy is returning , '' he said . \n`` Some provisions are becoming shorter , but things will return to normalcy within a short period -- maybe a few days . '' \nHe said Libyan authorities have asked those tribe members who have attacked barracks and police stations to return the weapons they had taken `` because security and safety will return to normal . '' \nReferring to reports that the military had attacked civilians , he said , `` We have reports and evidence they are not using arms unless against those who attacked the barracks . '' \nThe spokesman said U.S. and Israeli intelligence operatives were behind the unrest . \n`` We will get rid of them , in collaboration with our people in the eastern province , '' he said . \nDespite such claims and even as he called on Libyans who `` love and support him '' to take to the streets and demonstrate for him , Gadhafi 's grip on power appeared to be weakening . \nIn eastern Libya , groups of armed people wearing civilian clothing were guarding the streets as opposition leaders seemed to be in firm control , CNN 's Ben Wedeman reported . \nWedeman was the first Western television correspondent to enter and report from Libya during the crisis . \nAs Wedeman and his crew were entering the country , a young man at the border in civilian clothing and toting an AK-47 asked them for their passports . \n`` For what ? '' \nresponded Wedeman 's driver . \n`` There is no government . \nWhat is the point ? '' \nThey then drove in . \nOn the Libyan side , there were `` no officials , no passport control , no customs , '' Wedeman reported . \nAfter meeting Tuesday in an emergency summit , the Arab League issued a statement suspending Libya 's participation in the body 's meetings and all the group 's agencies . \nThe statement called for the immediate cessation of violence and condemned what it called crimes against protesters and peaceful strikers in Libya . \nIt also asked Libyan authorities to lift the ban imposed on the media , to open communications and telephone networks and to ensure the delivery of emergency medical aid to the wounded . \nThe U.N. Security Council met Tuesday in private -- the group 's first meeting since the wave of protests began rippling through Arab countries several weeks ago -- and then issued a statement condemning the violence in Libya . \nIt called on authorities `` to act with restraint , to respect human rights and international humanitarian law and to allow immediate access to international human rights monitors and humanitarian agencies . '' \nIbrahim Dabbashi , Libya 's deputy ambassador to the United Nations , said the statement `` was not strong enough , but I think it is a good message to the regime in Libya about stopping the bloodshed . '' \nDabbashi said Monday that the death toll could be as high as 800 . \nHuman Rights Watch said Monday that at least 233 people have been killed during the unrest . \nCNN has been in contact with medics and witnesses in Libya , whose accounts appear to corroborate the Human Rights Watch report . \nThe rights group said Tuesday that witnesses in Tripoli `` have described Libyan forces firing ` randomly ' at protesters '' this week and that sources from two hospitals in Tripoli reported at least 62 bodies being taken to their morgues since February 20 . \nWitnesses have told CNN that helicopter gunships fired into crowds of protesters . \nLibya 's government denied it was turning its air force against civilians . \nGadhafi 's second-oldest son , Saif al-Islam Gadhafi , told the state news agency Jamahiriya the warplanes were targeting weapons depots in remote areas . \nBut one witness , who agreed to be identified only as Adam , said helicopters landed troops `` armed to the teeth '' in Tripoli 's Green Square on Monday . \n`` They have been using aerial tactics , along with men on the ground , to disperse and shoot indiscriminately into crowds , '' he said . \nThe force included both government troops and mercenaries working for Gadhafi , he said . \nResidents responded by barricading themselves in their homes and setting up makeshift checkpoints to keep cars full of gunmen out of their neighborhoods . \nOn Tuesday evening , some anti-government protesters began trying to gather in Tripoli and were fired on by people on foot wearing plainclothes , a witness said . \nThe sounds of `` nonstop bullets '' could be heard throughout the capital , which the source described as `` electronic firing . '' \nAt least some of the firing seemed to be coming from Green Square , the source said . \nRed cars drove through the streets of Tripoli and fired indiscriminately at people , a source in the capital said . \nResidents of Tripoli reported Tuesday a food shortage , gunfire and intimidation by security forces . \nSecurity forces cordoned off the Fashloom suburb of the capital and were shooting people on the streets , including those who were trying to retrieve bodies , said Mohamed Abdallah , spokesman for the National Front for the Salvation of Libya opposition group . \nAbdallah attributed the information to four witnesses on the ground . \nAn opposition figure said some people were told the bodies of their loved ones would not be released unless they signed a form saying the person had died in surgery . \nCNN could not immediately confirm reports for most areas . \nThe Libyan government maintains tight control on communications and has not responded to repeated requests for access to the country . \nBut CNN has interviewed numerous witnesses by phone . \nIn eastern Libya , where Wedeman was reporting , residents said hundreds of mercenaries from sub-Saharan Africa had been killed or captured while fighting for Gadhafi , but much of the army appeared to have switched over to anti-government forces . \nIn Tobruk , demonstrators chanted the same slogans that were heard in recent days in Tunis , Tunisia , and Cairo , Egypt : `` The people want to topple the regime ! '' \nHere , the old Libyan flag now flies over the main square . \nThe police station , a hated symbol of Gadhafi 's rule , has been ransacked . \nOther buildings were sacked , but banks and some other installations appeared untouched . \nPeople in Tobruk were threatening to cut off the export of oil from eastern Libya `` unless this massacre is stopped immediately , '' local leader Abdallah Sharif told CNN . \nBut a U.S official with access to U.S. intelligence told CNN `` little to no disruption of Libyan oil production '' has been seen as a result of the unrest . \nAnd Deputy Energy Secretary Daniel Poneman , who was attending the International Energy Forum in Saudi Arabia , said U.S. officials had seen no evidence of an oil shortage . \n`` We believe there is a lot of product in the market , '' he said . \nStill , the senior source close to the Libyan government said ammunition depots had been attacked and ammunition and guns were `` everywhere . '' \nThe source said the country was fighting `` Islamic extremists . '' \nThe unrest in Libya has been fueled by protesters demanding freedom and decrying high unemployment . \nEven as Gadhafi tried to hold on to power , he attracted the ire of increasing numbers of Libyans worldwide . \nAbout 250 protesters stormed into the Libyan Embassy in Kuala Lumpur , Malaysia , on Tuesday , chanting and calling for Gadhafi to step down , a counselor at the embassy said . \nOsama Ahmed said most of the protesters were Libyan students studying in Malaysia . \nThe protests were peaceful , he said . \nA top Libyan diplomat stationed in China said Tuesday he had resigned in protest of his government 's crackdown on protesters and called on Gadhafi to step down and leave the country . \nHussein Sadiq al Musrati , who was the second secretary in the Libyan mission to Beijing before stepping down four days ago , joined about 20 students and protesters in front of the Libyan Embassy in Beijing on Tuesday . \nDemonstrators held signs that read , `` The game is over . \nGet out ... you 're finished . '' \nAdm. Mike Mullen , U.S. chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , said the Libyan `` military firing on its own people , killing its own people is absolutely unacceptable .

{"id": "178", "time": "2011-02-22", "text": "By John D. Sutter , CNN Protestors in Egypt show their support for an ongoing anti-government demonstrations in neighboring Libya . \nCNN reporter says internet access has been cut Traffic monitors say access has been sporadic , cut most often at night The massive Saharan country , long controlled by the dictator Moammar Gadhafi , has suffered `` rolling blackouts '' of its internet connections during the regime 's ongoing violent crackdown on protestors , according to the internet traffic monitor Renesys . \nThe cause of these internet service cuts , however , remains uncertain . \nPossibilities include a government crackdown , an internet traffic overload or simple power outages , said Jim Cowie , Renesys ' co-founder . \n`` If this had happened in any other country I might have said , ` Oh , that 's just a provider . \nMaybe they had a power outage in their data center and their servers would n't start up , '' he said . \nCNN 's Ben Wedeman , one of the few independent journalists on the ground in eastern Libya , wrote that `` the electricity was working . \nThe cell phone system is still functioning , though you ca n't call abroad . \nThe internet , however , has been down for days . '' \nGoogle 's online `` Transparency Report '' shows internet searches from Libya , which is controlled by anti-government demonstrators , have been happening at below-average levels in recent days . \nAnd Arbor Networks , a network security company , issued similar findings . \nInternational internet traffic to and from Libya was shut down on Saturday morning from about 1 to 8 a.m. and again on Sunday during the same timeframe , according to Renesys ' analysis , which was posted on the company 's blog and is based on traffic data the company collects from internet service providers around the world . \nIt 's almost as if the country had instituted a `` overnight internet curfew , '' Cowie said , adding it 's possible that Gadhafi 's government wanted to crack down on cyber dissidents who are known to organize online while other people sleep . \nReports of wider-spread internet outages could be an indication that Libya is using more sophisticated methods to control the internet , some of which would n't be visible to international traffic monitors like Renesys . \nIran , for example , is known for shutting down internet traffic at the neighborhood level , or removing capacity from the local internet to the point that local and international Web traffic simply overload the system , Cowie said . \n`` You remove capacity until everybody is squeezing through a small soda straw , '' he said . \nLibya 's internet blackouts are somewhat similar to those instituted by neighboring Egypt 's government during protests in that country . \nEgypt , however , completely shut down internet access for five days during protests against the regime of Hosni Mubarak , who was forced to resign after 30 years . \nThat move appeared to be an attempt by the government to shut down access to blogs , e-mail , Facebook and Twitter , which were used heavily by some of the people who helped organize the anti-Mubarak protests which toppled his government after 18 days on the streets . \nWael Ghonim , a prominent Egyptian protestor , issued a warning to other dictators in the Middle East and North Africa , saying , `` If you want to liberate a society , just give them the internet . '' \nIt 's unclear how much of a role the internet and social media sites have played in organizing the protests in Libya . \nThe news network Al-Jazeera reports Facebook was used to help coordinate the start of the protests in Libya , which went into full swing on February 17 . \n`` In a country where public dissent is rare , plans for Thursday 's protests were being circulated by anonymous activists on social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter , '' the news organization writes . \n`` One Facebook group urging a ` Day of Anger ' in Libya , which had 4,400 members on Monday , saw that number more than double to 9,600 by Wednesday . '' \nSome authoritarian regimes restrict internet access , as was the case in Egypt , as a way to try to stay in power . \nOthers , like Syria , China and Russia , filter some websites and use the internet as a way to monitor their citizens and steer public discourse . \nThe internet infrastructure in Egypt and Libya is quite different , Cowie said . \n`` The key thing to remember is the massive difference in scale between the two countries . \nEgypt 's internet was thousands of prefixes . \nLibya 's internet is about a dozen prefixes , '' he said . \nAn internet prefix is like an online ZIP code . \nIt 's a number used to group devices that access the internet . \nLibya has 13 of these online zip codes out of the 400,000 internet prefixes that make up the entire internet , Cowie said . \nThat makes the country a `` very small corner of a very big universe . '' \nAlso of note : Only about 6 % of Libyans are on the internet , compared to nearly a quarter of people in Egypt , according to the ITU , an agency of the United Nations that focuses on the internet and communications . \nLibya 's access to the international internet is controlled by a single company , which is run by the state , Cowie said . \nThat would make it easier , in theory , for the country to shut down internet connections than it was in Egypt , where the government had to call several internet service providers and order them to cut service as part of emergency law . \nMeanwhile , as Wired.com reports , a Twitter activist called Arasmus has created a map of the few unconfirmed internet reports that are coming out of Libya . \n"}

Frank ` disappointed ' in Obama Kucinich : If it looks like war , it 's war `` Taken in response to direct appeals from the Libyan people , and acting with a mandate from the United Nations , the United States mobilized a broad coalition , stopped an advancing army , prevented a massacre , established a no-fly zone , and limited the spread of violence and instability in a region pivotal to U.S. security interests , '' it says . \nIn response , Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck said , `` The creative arguments made by the White House raise a number of questions that must be further explored . \nRegardless , the commander-in-chief has a responsibility to articulate how U.S. military action is vital to our national security and consistent with American policy goals . \nWith Libya , the president has fallen short on this obligation . \nWe will review the information that was provided today but hope and expect that this will serve as the beginning , not the end , of the president 's explanation for continued American operations in Libya . '' \nThe exchange of documents came after a bipartisan group of House members filed a lawsuit Wednesday that challenges U.S. participation in the Libya military mission . \nBoehner , R-Ohio , said in a letter to Obama on Tuesday that the administration could be in violation of the War Powers Resolution , if it fails to get congressional authorization by Sunday , the 90th day since the mission began and a deadline that some legal experts cite as the deadline set by the resolution . \nThe lawsuit addresses a long-standing dispute between the executive and legislative branches -- meaning the White House and Congress -- over the powers of the president to send forces to war . \n`` We are intending through our presence and through this lawsuit to correct an imbalance which exists today , to correct a deficiency in the separation of powers , to correct ... and to firmly establish that Congress is a co-equal branch of government and that the founders made it unmistakably clear they did not intend for the war power to be placed in the hands of an executive , '' said Rep. Dennis Kucinich , D-Ohio , an anti-war liberal and one of the 10 legislators filing the lawsuit . \nRep. Tim Johnson , R-Illinois , said the legal issue was whether Obama exceeded his authority in committing U.S. forces to the Libya mission . \n`` Did he act illegally ? \nThe answer is yes , '' Johnson said . \nBut Wednesday 's report from the White House say that U.S. operations are limited to a supporting role in a coalition whose operations are authorized by the U.N. Security Council resolution . \nThey `` do not involve sustained fighting or active exchanges of fire with hostile forces , nor do they involve the presence of U.S. ground troops , U.S. casualties or a serious threat thereof , or any significant chance of escalation into a conflict characterized by those factors . '' \nIn a letter to Boehner and to the president pro tempore of the Senate , Daniel Inouye of Hawaii , Obama called U.S. support for the NATO-based coalition `` crucial to assuring the success of international efforts to protect civilians and civilian-populated areas from the actions of the Gadhafi regime , and to address the threat to international peace and security posed by the crisis in Libya . '' \nHe noted that no U.S. ground forces have been deployed , except for operations to rescue the crew of a U.S. aircraft on March 21 . \nBut Kucinich said earlier in the day that the Obama administration must make its case in court . \n`` They can tell it to the judge now , '' Kucinich said . \n`` They ca n't claim this is n't a war . '' \nThe lawsuit asks the court to `` declare that the war in Libya is illegal and order the White House to stop . '' \nThe goal of the administration and legislators who support the Libya mission is approval of a new resolution that backs U.S. participation , which would serve as an equivalent to congressional authorization . \nThe White House has said it was complying with the War Powers Resolution through frequent briefings on the Libya mission , and Wednesday 's report cited dozens of them . \nBoehner 's letter contested that assertion . \n`` Since the mission began , the administration has provided tactical operational briefings to the House of Representatives , but the White House has systematically avoided requesting a formal authorization for its action , '' Boehner 's letter said . \n`` It has simultaneously sought , however , to portray that its actions are consistent with the War Powers Resolution . \nThe combination of these actions has left many members of Congress , as well as the American people , frustrated by the lack of clarity over the administration 's strategic policies , by a refusal to acknowledge and respect the role of the Congress , and by a refusal to comply with the basic tenets of the War Powers Resolution . '' \nSuch political wrangling over war powers is common in Washington , with presidents frequently seeking to expand their freedom to commit U.S. forces and Congress battling to exert influence on the process . \nCongressional opponents of the mission say that its objective of civilian protection fails to match the stated U.S. goal of Moammar Gadhafi 's resignation or ouster and that the Libya situation could become a stalemate . \nThe White House says incremental progress is occurring through increasing diplomatic , political and military pressure on Gadhafi to step down . \nIn a coincidence of scheduling , Obama and Boehner are set to play golf together for the first time Saturday , a day after Boehner 's deadline for information from the administration and the day before he says it could be in violation of the War Powers Resolution . \nCNN 's Tom Cohen , Brianna Keilar and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report . \n"}
{"id": "113", "time": "2011-06-15", "text": "President Obama is set to defend U.S. military involvement in Libya to Congress as soon as today , according to the White House . \nCongressional sources are expecting a written report answering a number of questions the House of Representatives posed in a resolution passed with bipartisan support over a week ago , including inquiries about the president s goal in Libya , how he hopes to achieve that goal , why he has not sought congressional authorization for involving U.S. troops abroad and how much the conflict will ultimately cost . \nWhite House spokesman Tommy Vietor said the report will address a whole host of issues about our ongoing efforts in Libya , including those raised in the House resolution as well as our legal analysis with regard to the War Powers Resolution . \nMany members of congress Democrats and Republicans accuse the president of flouting the War Powers Resolution , which says the president can involve U.S. troops abroad for 60 days without congressional authorization but must withdraw them within another 30 days without a congressional okay . \nThe White House maintains it is acting in accordance with the law . \nThe report to congress follows a letter Speaker John Boehner sent to President Obama Tuesday warning him that he will be in violation of the War Powers resolution come Friday , 90 days after U.S. involvement in the Libya conflict began , though Vietor says the response was already in the works ahead of Boehner s letter to the president . \nBarry is a warmonger , he sent 100,000 + troops to Afghanistan looking for OBL . \nTwo copters and a couple of seals is all we needed . \nLet me make a suggestion , impeach . \nJune 15 , 2011 at 10:16 am | Reply Let me make a statement and a fact ... you are an IDIOT !!

I 've heard Obama is from HAWAI , KENYA , a city located somewhere on NEPTUN or PLUTO !!! June 15 , 2011 at 11:42 am | Bush may have left Obama to clean up a mess , but he 's the one who has made the mess worse . \nWe 're still nation building in Iraq and Afghanistan and now Libya . \nHe 's deployed more troops than Bush ever had . \nHe 's also breaking the War Powers Act and should be impeached . \nWe have a fourteen trillion dollar debt while we 're wasting money on a foreign policy that just attracts more terrorists to want to harm the US . \nRon Paul 2012 June 15 , 2011 at 2:22 pm | As far as I am concerned , every President and every Congress since Eisenhower are guilty of violating the Constitution . \nI grew up thinking it took an act of Congress to declare war , and a military incursion into sovereign countries without first declaring war is in itself an act justifying the declaration of war . \nWhat we have had all along are a bunch of chickenhawks pandering to the military industrial complex but terrified to actually declare war . \nWhat justification would we have needed to invade Vietnam , Grenada , Iraq , Afghanistan , and others ? \nWere the USA to actually declare war , we 'd have to gain the support of Americans first . \nThis bunch of spineless cowards know nothing but sleazy politics and would never risk anything by committing to a real war . \nIt breaks my heart to see Americans volunteer to act like lawless marauders under the guise of `` saving the world and the USA . '' \nBut in the end , it 's not the military men and women who committed the crimes , it 's the so-called leadership that will do anything to avoid personal responsibility . \nThe Vietnam-era vets have every right to storm and take out our central government for the crimes they 've committed against Americans . \nJune 15 , 2011 at 3:51 pm | @ lauradet -- It could also be said that President Bush had to send the troops into Afghanistan and Iraq because it was President Clinton who failed to take out Osama bin Ladin back in the 1990s after the original World Trade Center bombing and the bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania . \nJune 15 , 2011 at 4:10 pm | Your logic is flawed . \nBecause even if Clinton did fail to get Osama Bin Laden , Bush as President and Commander-in-Chief had a choice about how to respond to 9-11 . \nHe CHOSE to declare war and sent troops into Afghanistan . \nHe had other choices , like do nothing , a more limited response , use covert\\/special ops and air power only , etc. . \nAs for IRAQ , that had absolutely nothing to do with 9-11 and took much needed resources AWAY from Afghanistan . \nIraq could have totally been avoided . \nBoth of those wars were already in play when Pres. Obama took office . \nJune 15 , 2011 at 5:17 pm | That 's right he is cleaning up George Bush 's mess by adding up one more mess to heritage ! \nJune 15 , 2011 at 7:09 pm | And your logic is flawed there xwing ... the president ca n't declare war ... only congress can ... and they at least voted to support the action initially ... as for the teleprompter ... who knows ...

June 15 , 2011 at 1:35 pm | Umm ... the Dem party would be the primary party whose negligence allowed 9\\/11 to happen . \nAll of those involved were in the U.S. 2 years before it happened with visas that were expired for at least 11\\/2 years of that . \nWhen their visas expired , the Clinton administration failed to deport them , just like Democrats have stood in the way of deporting the other ~ 10 million people who are in this country illegally . \nJune 15 , 2011 at 4:20 pm | Now ADOC a direct question ... How did the Republicans in congress and the presidency on 9\\/11\\/2001 after having 8 months in office result in the culmination of a plot that started dduring the reign of W. J. Clinton ? \nHe was the guy that blew up the asprin factory and turned down the offer to be handed OBL on a platter . \nJune 15 , 2011 at 9:47 pm | Bush 's response to 9\\/11 was his problem . \nHe did n't plan 9\\/11 but his response leaves much to be desired . \nInstead of going for OBL where he was known to be and sticking to it , he diverted his attention to Iraq because he knew Afghanistan was going to be one long hard haul . \nHe did n't care about catching OBL just whipping someone 's fanny and saying `` Mission Accomplished '' . \nFrom a salesman 's point of view it is called bait and switch . \nAs we all know Iraq did n't turn out as easy as he thought it would either . \nIt is one thing to destroy a country 's infrastructure , but not a easy to rebuild a nation with a working government . \nJune 16 , 2011 at 1:25 pm | Jean when Barry establishes his version of Pravada , I am sure you will be offered a job ...

Bush , John Boehner and the Republican Party to create a scheme and lie and mislead the American people , the UN and the world community about bogus and non existent weapons of mass destruction in Iraq , dragging us into a bloody and senseless war that may last for decades to come . \nAnd what the 2003 war powers act did not authorize was for George W. Bush and the Republican Party to prematurely withdraw UN inspectors from Iraq by force to start their illegitimate Iraqi war . \nDuring this UN mission , both long and short range Iraqi missiles were being destroyed before the world eyes each and every day by UN inspectors and the Iraqi war arsenal was being made inefficient and obselete without bloodshed and lost of life . \nSubsequently , Iraq was no longer a threat to its neighbors and neither was it an immenent threat to the United States . \nHowever , the dictator and war criminal George W. Bush , John Boehner and his Republican Party violated American and international law by prematurely removing UN inspectors from Iraq by force to start their illegitimate Iraqi war . \nThe result is 4,000 plus dead US troops and half a million Iraqi civilians dead to date . \nBut ten years later , no one is yet to call for the impeachment and imprisonment of George W. Bush , John Boehner and the Republican party . \nAnd what has president Obama done wrong in his handling of the Libyan crisis ? \nHas any American lives been lost in the Libyan conflict ? \nHave we committed ground troops to the Libyan conflict ? \nAre we actually involved in the conflict at this moment or just proving logistic support to NATO ? \nand is president Obama hurting our economy by supporting the UN mandated Libyan Mission ? \nI may add that today we are spending 11 billion US dollars a month in the Afghan war the GOP abandoned to start their illegitimate Iraqi war and so far we have spent 1 trillion US dollars in Iraq . \nSo who is really to be blamed here ? \nAnd today we are still suffering casualties in Afghanistan because George W. Bush , John Boehner and the GOP abandoned and prolonged the Afghan war to wage their senseless and illegitimate Iraqi war . \nSo far Mladic has been arrested and taken to the ICC in the Hague for war crimes against humanity but ten years later , George W. Bush is showing up at NBA finals and Superbowls , living it up while American sons and daughters are dead as a result of his insidious war atrocities and he is yet to be tried for war crimes . \nSo why the double standard ? \nAnd is there preferencial treatment when the war criminal in question is white and American ? \nAt the onset of the Libyan crisis , John McCain , John Boehner and the Republican Party rediculied president Obama and accused him of dragging his feet and not rushing to intervene militarily in Libya because in their words , Libyan civilians were being slaughtered by the Libyan government . \nBut as soon as president Obama with support of the world community followed through on a UN mandated mission to protect the Libyan people , the GOP decided to flip flopped on the issue , making a 360 and accusing the president of rushing to war . \nMy message to the GOP is you 've got to be kidding right ? \nBut perhaps the reason why the GOP is upping its stance and criticism on the president for our involvement in Libya is probably because they sense that the Libyan government is about to collapse any day now and they just want to score political points by trying to prevent president Obama from getting credit should Moammar Ghadaffi fall . \nBut what is amasing is that everytime the GOP tries to set up roadblocks for the Obama administration , at the end of the day this administration prevails and so do the American people . \nRemember Obama got Osama ? \nYea , and it sure was nice to see Americas celebrate all across the country , waving the American flag once more on that faithful night and remembering what it is like to feel patriotic and be American once again . \nAnd yes , we will wave ole glory once aagain in 2012 for OBAMA\\/BIDEN . \nJune 15 , 2011 at 12:34 pm | Reply I am lost . \nI thought it was the Navy Seals that got Osama and Obama was no doubt on golf course . \nJune 15 , 2011 at 1:44 pm | Reply June 15 , 2011 at 2:17 pm | Reply Where did all the intelligent people go ??

'' \nSome of Gadhafi 's thugs posed as anti-government protesters and told men on the street to join them , he said . \nA protester I interviewed earlier confirmed that , saying they were spreading rumors that Gadhafi had left the country . \nA Libyan man from Dubai said he could n't reach his hotel that same night because it was blockaded by military closing in on around 100 anti-regime protesters who set trash cans and photos of Gadhafi on fire . \nHe heard machine-gun fire and saw three government land cruisers drive by . \nTwo of the three cars were filled with African mercenaries , and the third seemed to be Eastern Europeans , he said . \nAll the men carried AK-47s , he said . \nSaleh , a Libyan-American working in Tripoli , took part in the protests at the Green Square . \nHe was attacked by Gadhafi 's militia and fled the scene . \n`` I ended up having to hide out in an alleyway all night because I could hear them searching for us , '' he said . \nOn the first night the protesters in the Green Square thought they were victorious because they had driven out some of Gadhafi 's thugs . \nThen the military showed up and started attacking protesters , who fled to different areas . \nSaleh and Tareq both confirm reports that help from Benghazi is on the way . \n`` We are united . \nThere is a plan , and the people of Libya are not giving up . '' \nAn American from Wisconsin overhears our conversation and expresses his support for the protesters , saying Gadhafi 's end is `` imminent . '' \n`` Pardon the metaphor , '' he says , `` but Gadhafi is gonna go down like a sinking ship .

'' \nIt 's a question that has haunted Ahmed , 26 , and his two brothers all of their lives . \nTheir father , a Libyan opposition activist , `` disappeared '' 20 years ago . \nThe sons of Izzat Almegaryaf do n't know where he is -- or whether he is still alive . \nAll that they know is derived from a handful of letters smuggled out of a Tripoli jail in the mid-1990s . \nFor two decades , they 've been left to ponder the grim possibilities of what happens to a man who opposes a dictator as ruthless as Moammar Gadhafi . \nNow , a popular revolt in Libya has presented new hope for the Almegaryaf brothers . \nGadhafi has vowed rivers of blood to preserve his power . \nBut for the first time since he seized Libya 's helm in 1969 , his fate seems uncertain . \nAs images and reports from Libya flooded the brothers ' television and computer screens this week , Ahmed , Youcif and Bashir could think of nothing except their father . \nAnd the possibility that at last , they might find answers to the question that has defined their lives . \nYoucif , 27 , remembers the day his father was taken away , and could hardly watch footage of Gadhafi 's crackdown on protesters . \nThis was the man he believes is responsible for destroying his own family . \nHow could he simply watch from afar ? \nHe said his goodbyes to Ahmed and Bashir , busy studying economics and international relations at Emory University . \nNow 21 , Bashir has chosen to study subjects that were dear to the father he has never known . \nYoucif made his way to the Atlanta airport Tuesday evening to board a flight to Cairo , Egypt , compelled to help in any way he could . \nFor now , he plans to shuttle medical aid into eastern Libya . \nThe Almegaryaf family believes the Libyan people will prevail . \nThey believe Gadhafi is in his last hours , desperation oozing from his words and actions . \nWith that prospect , improbable for so long , the three brothers know only this : They are perhaps on the verge of finally knowing many truths about their nation -- and about their father . \nLibyan activist Izzat Almegaryaf , with sons Ahmed , left , and Youcif in the late '80s , was a target of Moammar Gadhafi 's . \n` Daddy , I want to go with you ' On a March evening 20 years ago , a man wearing a traditional Arab disdasha appeared at the apartment in Cairo that the three young Almegaryaf brothers shared with their parents . \nIzzat Almegaryaf had fled Gadhafi 's Libya several years earlier , but he had never surrendered his dreams of freedom . \nThe man in the disdasha demanded that Izzat go with him . \n`` Daddy , I want to go with you , '' pleaded Youcif , then only 6 . \nHis father did not turn back . \nPlucked from his home and blindfolded , Izzat was put on a jet to Tripoli , the capital of his homeland , and thrown behind bars in one of Gadhafi 's jails . \nNo one informed his family of the charges against him . \nNo one told them of his whereabouts . \nGadhafi had called for a `` physical liquidation '' of his political opponents , many of whom were arrested and put to death in public executions , according to Amnesty International . \nIzzat Almegaryaf was one of Gadhafi 's targets . \nOn that March evening , a family 's life was shattered . \nA husband , disappeared . \nA wife , Nora , suddenly alone . \nAnd three little boys left fatherless . \nYoucif and Ahmed , then 5 , yearned to go to the Cairo zoo again with their father so they could feed carrots to the giraffes . \nOr sit and watch their father play cards with his friends , trying to learn how to mimic his every move . \nThey missed their father 's embrace . \nBashir was -- blissfully perhaps -- only five weeks old when Izzat was taken and does not harbor the memories of his older brothers . \nHe grew up constantly asking questions about their father : `` What was Baba like ? '' \nThree years later , the family settled in suburban Atlanta under the wing of Mohammed Almegaryaf , the boys ' uncle and once a high-ranking Libyan government official who founded the opposition National Front for the Salvation of Libya . \nThey eked out a new life , becoming citizens of a place far from North Africa , always waiting for the day when Gadhafi would tumble and their father would be released . \nFor two agonizing decades , they spent their days longing for one man and hating another . \nOver the years , people told Nora to forget the life she made with Izzat , a handsome former army officer and political activist who loved poetry and music . \nThey told her she should remarry , find happiness again . \nNora refused to abandon her husband . \nShe believed in her heart he would return . \nAnd yet , the boys knew that they could not kid themselves . \nThey were dealing with one of the most ruthless regimes in the world . \nThey learned snippets of their father 's circumstances through his letters from Abu Salim prison . \nBut the last was received in the mid 1990s . \nThere has been no direct news of Izzat since then , though reliable witnesses working with human rights groups including Amnesty International and the United Nations Human Rights Council have reported sightings of him up until 1996 , the year Gadhafi squashed an uprising at Abu Salim with brutal force . \nHuman Rights Watch says 1,200 prisoners were killed that day . \nIt would be one thing to cope with a father 's detention . \nIt is another to pass each waking hour not knowing . \nThe boys recalled always being asked by strangers : `` Where is your father ? '' \n`` He 's away on a business trip , '' Youcif would reply , knowing the security risks for speaking the truth . \nThe family had received anonymous telephone calls threatening them right after Izaat 's abduction . \nAnother time , a suspicious phone call came to Youcif 's elementary school in Atlanta from a man who alleged he was Izzat and that the school should have the boy ready to be picked up . \nThe family felt they were being watched ; that too many people knew too many things about them . \nThat was the nature of Gadhafi 's security apparatus , they said . \nSometimes , Youcif had nightmares of his father being pulled out of his cell and shot . \nAhmed developed nonepileptic seizures -- sometimes up to seven an hour -- that his therapist concluded were trauma-induced . \nAt first , Nora read out only parts of her husband 's letters that were addressed to the boys . \nShe wanted to spare her tender children the harsh truth . \nShe knew the letters were genuine -- they were written in her husband 's distinct Arabic calligraphy , often difficult to decipher by those unfamiliar with it . \nHe told her he had not been the best husband and father and that it had been due to his `` preoccupation with the Libyan cause . '' \nTo his sons , his `` three musketeers , his dear ones , the light of my eyes , '' he wrote : `` You are my dreams for a better future for all of us . \nI can not express to you how much I do miss you , for writing wo n't do it justice . \nYou are always on my mind . \nYour greetings reach me with every breath of fresh air I get in the early morning . \nThey reach me with the birds , which have made a nest on my pillow . \nWhenever the guards go to sleep , the birds come to me telling me stories about you . \nYour greetings reach me as the wind plays music on the walls of my cell . \nYou come to me with the sunrise of every sun and fill my heart with love . \nYou come to me at night with every moon . \nYou are always with me . '' \nHe told them to learn how to be strong , to learn to swim and ride a horse . \nTo always be good Muslims . \nAnd that one day , he knew , they would be reunited in a free Libya . \n`` I taught you that our country does not become greater without us standing up to defend it . \nIt only grows with our efforts , sweat and sacrifices , '' he wrote . \n`` When I was with you , I used to worry for your safety , show you endless love , and give you whatever you asked for , you can only imagine how I feel now as I am far away from you . '' \nThe boys held on to every word . \nThey tried to picture their father sitting in a dark cell . \nWhere did he get the paper ? \nWhat was he wearing ? \nWas he in pain ? \nHow was he treating his diabetes ? \nLater , they learned from the letters that their father was detained by a Col. Mohamed Hassan , an Egyptian security agent . \nHe had `` disappeared '' along with Jabballah Hamed Matar , another leading Libyan opposition figure in Cairo . \nThe two men were taken to the headquarters of the Egyptian military security for further interrogation and then transferred to Abu Salim prison in Tripoli . \n`` Your mother may have told you how I asked the butterflies , the flowers and birds to take care of you , '' he wrote to them . \n`` I asked the wind to gently play with locks of your hair and lessen the difficulties of your life . \nAs for the clouds , I have asked them to rain candy on you , and give you shade when it gets hot , and the sky , I asked it to gently rain love and tenderness onto you . \nI wrote for you songs and stories about the homeland and made it into a necklace I placed on you when you were young . '' \nAnd he asked : `` Do you also think of me ? '' \nA third brother , Bashir Almegaryaf , 21 , protests this month against the Libyan regime in downtown Atlanta . \nOne step closer to knowing Youcif , who began working at 16 to help support his family , has in many ways stepped into his father 's shoes . \nOf the three sons , he bears the closest resemblance to Izzat . \nHe has been outspoken in denouncing Gadhafi . \nHe has taken his family 's cause to the U.N. Human Rights Council and to the British Parliament , where he broke down while speaking about his brother 's seizures . \nHe has written to U.S. congressmen and senators . \nUnder international law , he tells them , forced disappearances qualify as torture for the victim and his family . \nHe can not understand why America wo n't help its own citizens who are being tortured . \nNow , he has committed his strongest act to date , stepping aboard a plane that would carry him physically closer to that place that has fully occupied his heart . \nBefore he left , he spoke of the unbridled violence unfolding in his country . \n`` It 's literally a genocide , '' he said . \n`` And we 're doing nothing about it . '' \nHe contemplated the possibility that soon , he might set foot on the soil of his ancestors . \nIt is a land of pristine beaches and majestic mountains , of people and traditions hidden from the world under Gadhafi 's black curtain . \nHis father , like thousands of educated Libyans , knew his country was doomed when early in his rule , Gadhafi scrapped Libya 's constitution and implemented revolutionary law . \n`` I think the devils work for him , '' chimed in Youcif 's brother Ahmed , who has been compiling as much information as he can about the uprising and disseminating it on Twitter , YouTube and Facebook . \n`` It 's hard to explain how ruthless he is , '' Ahmed said . \n`` It 's frustrating to see what he 's done and for the world to shrug it off . '' \nSometimes , he allows himself images in his head of his first meeting with his father . \nMore than anything , he just wants to look at him , feel him . \nHe wonders whether his father will be able to recognize his little boy . \nBut the images from Libya on television quickly remind him of Gadhafi 's police state . \nAnd Ahmed returns to reality . \n`` What if he did pass ? '' \nWhat if , after all this time , the family is shattered all over again ? \n"}

Anything could have happened . \nThere was no guarantee I was going to get out safely . '' \nEven though he 's on his way home to Ohio , he 's still haunted by stories of those he left behind , including a teammate who was held at gunpoint by a mercenary one day as he tried to get to the airport . \nA Libyan soldier was able to calm the mercenary down , Benzegala said . \n`` He definitely was in serious danger and probably would have been killed . \n... The mercenary was very , very violent and aggressive ; he just looked like he was itching to shoot somebody . '' \nFor Americans Erika and Franz Fearnley , the sound of protests and gunfire that kept getting closer and closer to their neighborhood just outside the Libyan capital ultimately forced them to make a dash for the airport in hopes of leaving the violence behind . \n`` The crowds sounded as if more and more people were joining in , -LRB- and -RRB- just hearing the gunfire and just knowing that people were probably losing their lives '' finally made them pack up , Erika Fearnley told CNN 's `` Parker-Spitzer '' on Thursday . \nThey and other Americans who have fled Libya 's descent into chaos have harrowing tales of escaping the carnage . \nAs Benzegala ran out of food and money -- living off of a single bowl of spaghetti for the past two days -- he decided he had to take a chance and get to the airport to leave the country . \nIt was a fateful decision by the former University of Tampa star point guard , so used to taking chances on the court but feeling out of his element in a foreign city under siege . \nAs the Fearnleys headed to the airport , they were stopped at a checkpoint manned by soldiers with machine guns , a scene Franz Fearnley described as `` terrifying . '' \n`` They knocked on the window ... they wanted to see our passports , '' he explained . \n`` It was scary , '' Erika Fearnley added . \nSalah Gamoudi , 24 , returned to Oregon on Tuesday from Libya , where the dual citizen was working with Ernst & Young as an auditor of oil companies . \nAs security forces started cracking down on protesters , Gamoudi said he , like other Tripoli residents , became fearful for his life and the lives of his family members . \nHe picked up a baseball bat to use as a weapon , if he needed one ; his neighbors fortified the streets and guarded their homes . \nAt the airport , the scene was one of confusion and disorder , Benzegala and the Fearnleys said . \n`` The airport was full to capacity . \nThey were not allowing anyone else in , '' said Franz Fearnley , who had been working on a land development project in Libya for the previous month . \nBut `` our -LRB- Libyan -RRB- driver had an uncle at the airport , thank God , and he was able to get us in , but once we got in , you could n't even move '' because it was so crowded , he said . \nGeorge Sayar , who was in Libya with his Florida-based construction company building roads and bridges , described the airport scene as `` utter chaos . '' \n`` I would say there was approximately 30-40 ,000 people , most of them without tickets , trying to get into the three entrances to the terminal , '' Sayar told CNN on Friday . \n`` We pretty much had to push and shove our way through thousands of people , and myself and two of my colleagues finally made it after about three hours of pushing , shoving , and kicking . '' \nAnother contractor who managed a tight escape was Cyrus Sany , who was working as an electrical engineer in Libya for a Virginia-based firm . \nHe said it took him six hours to get from the airport parking lot to the ticket counter . \nSany said it was a `` very extreme experience '' that he 'll never forget . \nBenzegala found himself crushed between the gates and travelers storming to get in after he arrived at the airport . \n`` I got in a skirmish , actually , trying to calm people down and got pushed to the ground by a guard and when I got up he hit me in the face and there were a couple other guys I saw get hit as well . '' \nIn the end he got a ticket and arrived at the departure area , but that was the end of the line . \nImmigration officials saw that there was no entrance stamp on his U.S. passport , and refused to let him board his flight , or book a new ticket out . \nBenzegala is a dual U.S.-Algerian citizen and had used his Algerian passport to enter the country . \nHe said he did n't think twice when he turned the passport over to his agent after getting the entrance stamp . \nHe returned to the abandoned sports complex and managed to call the U.S. Embassy , but officials there would only tell him to keep away from the windows and wait out the violence . \nHe learned about the chartered ferry in talking to CNN , and decided to make a run for it around dawn Wednesday when the fewest number of people were in the streets . \nCalls to his agent finally got through and his Algerian passport was returned along with a ride out to the port . \nHis teammate , a U.S. resident whose name Benzegala did n't want published for fear of his safety , did n't think he 'd be allowed on the ferry since he was not yet a U.S. citizen . \nHe planned to make another attempt to get to the airport , but his whereabouts are unknown . \nOn board the ferry , Benzegala said people stretched out on the floors to sleep , feeling safe at last . \nThose awake shared stories about their escape and the violence they had witnessed , but also fears about friends and family left behind . \nA U.S. Embassy official on board the ship , which was delayed for nearly two days because of high seas , warned Benzegala not to speak to the media before departure , explaining that revealing details about the situation could jeopardize the safety of all those on board . \nAs for the Fearnleys , now staying with family in New Jersey , they 're also worried about the friends they left behind . \n`` It 's just sad , '' Franz Fearnley said . \nCNN 's Brian Walker , Katy Byron , and Moni Basu contributed to this report \n"}
{"id": "71", "time": "2011-02-25", "text": "Libya : An opportunity for al Qaeda ? \nBy Paul Cruickshank , CNN Terrorism Analyst A border guard in an empty customs hall on the Libya-Egyptian border . \nFears are easing that al Qaeda will fill the void in Libya . \nCruickshank : Militant Islamists have played almost no role in the uprisings in the Arab world Cruickshank : For most Arabs , al Qaeda appears more irrelevant than ever But spiraling violence in Libya may provide future opportunities for militants -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Libya 's beleaguered leader Moammar Gadhafi Thursday blamed the uprising sweeping Libya on Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda , accusing the terrorist group of supplying Libyans with pills inducing them to revolt . \n`` Our children have been manipulated by al Qaeda , '' he told Libyan state television by telephone . \nSome may view this as Gadhafi 's greatest delusion yet . \nMilitant Islamists have played almost no role in the uprisings in Libya or anywhere else in the Arab world , and for most Arabs , energized by a powerful democracy movement , al Qaeda now appears more irrelevant than ever . \nBut there is nevertheless a danger that spiraling violence in Libya may provide militant Islamist groups future opportunities in the country . \nRadicalization has run higher in Libya in recent years than many other Arab countries , especially in Libya 's impoverished , restive eastern provinces , whose tribes have long felt discriminated by Tripoli . \nAt the peak of the Iraqi insurgency , more Libyans per capita traveled to join al Qaeda in Iraq than any other country . \nAnger over the Iraq war contributed to the radicalization of a generation of young Libyans . \nSome are concerned that the increasingly chaotic scenes in Libya are the beginning of a videotape that has been played before . \nMoammar Ghadafi talks Osama bin Laden In Iraq , chaotic conditions after the fall of Saddam Hussein gave foreign Islamist terrorists led by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi an opportunity to build up operations in the country . \nThe ensuing sectarian civil war , which they helped provoke , radicalized the local population , and provided al Qaeda with greatly expanded recruiting opportunities among Iraq 's Sunni community . \nMore than 100,000 Iraqis died before the insurgency was contained , more than 10,000 of whom were killed by al Qaeda suicide bombers . \nIn Algeria , a 1992 army coup following electoral gains by Islamist parties spawned a violent Islamist insurgency which saw the emergence of the GIA , a hard-line Islamist terrorist group founded by veterans of the Afghan anti-Soviet jihad , which had no qualms about massacring civilians . \nMore than 100,000 Algerians were killed in the crossfire of civil war before the insurgency waned in the mid-1990s . \nNoman Benotman , a former Libyan jihadist , is under no illusions about the opportunities available to al Qaeda and like-minded groups if there is an extended period of turmoil in Libya . \n`` If there 's chaos , there will be an opportunity for them . \nThat 's just alphabetic , '' Benotman , now a senior analyst at the Quilliam Foundation , a UK counter-extremist think-tank , told CNN . \nBenotman returned to London Monday after a two-week visit to Tripoli , and his warning comes at a deeply uncertain time for Libya . \nA post-dictator era in the North African state was always going to pose more challenges than in neighboring Egypt and Tunisia because of the country 's deeply tribal structures , lack of experience with elections , and only slowly emerging middle class . \nSuch conditions were created and compounded by Gadhafi 's deliberate suppression of civil society , his refusal to develop and empower state institutions , and his strategy of divide and rule between a baffling array of competing power centers , including revolutionary committees across the country that were intentionally created to cement his rule . \nAll this would have made a post-Gadhafi transition difficult at the best of times . \nBut the country is now in deep disarray and , unlike in Egypt and Tunisia , the army may be too weak and divided to step into the breach . \nDifficulties for jihadists in exploiting the unrest According to Benotman , even during a period of sustained unrest , al Qaeda and like-minded groups will not find it easy to seize the opportunity and build up their operations in Libya . \nBenotman points out that there is no established jihadist group left on the scene in Libya to exploit the unrest by recruiting , organizing and directing potential recruits . \nFreedom , political opening , and democracy will reduce the threat of extremists groups in Libya . \n-- Noman Benotman , former Libyan jihadist In 2009 , Benotman 's former group , the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group -LRB- LIFG -RRB- , formally ended its campaign to overthrow the Libyan regime , and it repudiated al Qaeda . \nIn the mid-1990s the LIFG had conducted a deadly campaign of attacks on Libyan security services , before a crackdown largely constrained the group 's ability to operate inside the country . \nThe breakthrough was the result of a two-year dialogue launched by Saif al-Islam Gadhafi , the son of Libya 's leader , and brokered by Benotman , a former high-ranking figure in the group . \nThe agreement also saw the group publish a new code of ethics for jihad , forbidding attacks on civilians and outlawing attacks in the West . \nSenior CNN International Correspondent Nic Robertson and I interviewed leading figures of the LIFG in Abu Salim prison in Tripoli in September 2009 , shortly before the group 's leaders were released . \nAlthough they were then behind prison bars , their disavowal of violence appeared genuine , and they appear to have stuck to their side of the bargain since . \nSome have argued that with the LIFG sidelined , the best-placed group to take advantage of deteriorating conditions in Libya is al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb -LRB- AQIM -RRB- , a largely Algerian terrorist group that grew out of the GIA . \nIn an indication that it seeks to exploit the situation in Libya , AQIM Thursday released a statement in support of the uprising in Libya , stating that it will do whatever it could to help . \nAQIM may have some opportunities in the medium term to establish itself in Libya . \nIn an interview with CNN 's Robertson in September 2009 , Saif al-Islam Gadhafi said a number of Libyans had joined AQIM 's ranks in Algeria and Mali and that the group would `` love to energize young Libyans . '' \nIn the near term , however , AQIM is neither well-placed to join in the uprising nor to exploit it . \nThe group , now largely based in the Sahel region of Mauritania , Mali and Niger , has very little presence in Libya because of the previously tight grip of Libya 's security services , and has been largely driven out of neighboring Algeria . \nFurthermore , according to Benotman , there has been lingering animosity between the Algerian terrorist group and Libyan jihadists ever since the GIA killed a number of LIFG members in Algeria in the mid-1990s , after the Libyans took issue with the GIA 's super-extremist ideology . \nAccording to Benotman , the LIFG 's new code of jihadist ethics , widely made available across Libya , will make some young Libyans think twice about joining terrorist groups . \nAl Qaeda has had no role in this uprising , none of the demonstrators are calling for an Islamic state . \n-- Noman Benotman , former Libyan jihadist The reduced relevance of al Qaeda Another factor that will make it difficult for Islamist terrorist groups to exploit the situation in Libya is the reduced relevance of al Qaeda 's message as a pro-democracy movement sweeps across the Middle East . \n`` Al Qaeda has had no role in this uprising , none of the demonstrators are calling for an Islamic state , '' Benotman told CNN . \nEven senior al Qaeda figures now concede this . \nThe revolutions sweeping the Arab world were not the `` perfections for which we hoped , '' purportedly wrote Attiya Allah , a leading Libyan al Qaeda ideologue believed to be based in Pakistan . \nSome reports had indicated that Allah died last year . \nThe statement posted on the internet Wednesday , and translated by the SITE Institute , was authored on February 16 as protests started gathering force in Libya . \nExpressing rather limited ambition , Allah said he hoped that a post-dictator era would give al Qaeda greater freedom to proselytize in the Middle East . \nAl Qaeda currently has no `` magic wand '' to provide the necessary manpower to overturn governments in the Middle East , added Allah . \nLibyan officials have painted a different picture , but their claims have been difficult to verify . \nOfficials , for example , alleged Sunday that a group called the Islamic Emirate of Barqa carried out deadly attacks on military installations in and around Darnah , a town on the Mediterranean coast in eastern Libya , with a population of around 80,000 . \nCNN has not been able to verify the claim The town may emerge as something of a litmus test for the reach of al Qaeda 's influence in Libya . \nIf militant extremist groups gains traction anywhere in Libya , they will likely do so first in places like Darnah , where years of neglect by the Gadhafi regime have created some of the bleakest socioeconomic prospects for young men in the Middle East , as well as simmering anger toward Tripoli . \nBy most accounts , radicalization has run high in the town in recent years . \nAccording to al Qaeda administrative records seized by the U.S. Army in Sinjar , Iraq , in 2007 , 52 men from that town -- more than any other city in the Arab world -- traveled to join al Qaeda 's Iraqi affiliate . \nBenotman says extremists may now be losing ground in Darnah . \nHe points out that Islamist demands have been absent from television images of the townsmen chanting in celebration of what they believe to be the end of Gadhafi rule . \nIf prospects improve in places like Darnah , young men will likely be less attracted to groups like al Qaeda , its blame-all-on-America narrative , and its promise of jihadist adventure , glory , and rewards in the afterlife . \nFor young Libyans the sense of excitement of being part of a historic democracy movement sweeping the Middle East may also make the lure of al Qaeda fade . \nThese events are creating a powerful narrative and promise of their own . \n`` Freedom , political opening , and democracy will reduce the threat of extremists groups in Libya , '' Benotman told CNN . \nIn the battle to shape the future of Libya , much will depend on what happens in the next days and weeks . \nThus far , eastern Libya -- the most promising recruiting ground for Islamist terrorist groups -- has largely been spared the brutal crackdown taking place in an around Tripoli . \nIf forces loyal to Gadhafi were able to retake control of eastern Libya , all bets would be off . \nThe bloodletting would undoubtedly play into the hands of al Qaeda and like-minded groups . \nBenotman says Libya 's best hope for avoiding a dangerous slide into chaos may now lie with the Free Officers , the group of young army officers who overthrew Libya 's monarchy and brought Gadhafi to power in 1969 . \nBenotman says many of the Free Officers still have high-ranking positions in the country 's military , and increasing numbers of them have defected from the regime , disturbed by Gadhafi 's brutal crackdown on civilians . \n`` This is a group drawn from all the tribes and regions of Libya , and they would be seen as representing the whole nation , '' Benotman told CNN . \n"}

'' \nThe point of U.S. action -- particularly the sanctions -- is to `` make it clear that the regime has to stop its abuses '' and end the bloodshed , Carney said . \nReports from Libya suggest that possibly hundreds of protesters have been killed . \nWashington also announced the suspension of all military cooperation with Libya , reversing a course of action taken after Gadhafi 's government ended its pursuit of weapons of mass destruction . \nObama will meet with United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in Washington on Monday to discuss the full range of diplomatic , legal and other steps that may be taken to bring a halt to the violence , Carney said . \nThe new steps against Gadhafi 's government were announced less than an hour after a flight chartered by the U.S. government departed Tripoli for Istanbul . \nThe flight carried personnel from the U.S. embassy and other American citizens . \nEarlier , a ferry chartered by U.S. authorities carried roughly 300 people to Malta . \nAs U.S. citizens continued to flee the spreading unrest , clashes between Libyan security forces and protesters were reported in Tripoli , which has been a Gadhafi stronghold . \nEastern Libya appeared to be largely in the hands of anti-government forces . \nObama spoke Thursday with the leaders of France , Italy and the United Kingdom on coordinating an international response to the crisis in the north African nation . \nIn separate phone conversations with French President Nicolas Sarkozy , Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and British Prime Minister David Cameron , Obama `` expressed his deep concern with the Libyan government 's use of violence which violates international norms and every standard of human decency , and discussed appropriate and effective ways for the international community to immediately respond , '' a White House statement noted . \nWhile some critics say the Obama administration has been slow to react to the deteriorating situation in Libya , the statement said Thursday 's discussions were to `` coordinate our urgent efforts to respond to developments and ensure that there is appropriate accountability .

'' \nWhy are people flocking to Malta ? \nCNN crew greeted as ` liberating heroes ' He pleaded with the protesters ' mothers to track them down in the streets of the coastal town about 55 kilometers -LRB- about 35 miles -RRB- west of Tripoli and take them home . \nHe added that he had ordered an end to the violence there , but his order upset his security forces . \n`` They told me they are being shot at and they were doing it in self-defense , '' Gadhafi said . \n`` Why do you give us orders to stop ? '' \nAddressing the people of Zawiya , he sent condolences to the families of the dead and wounded . \n`` These are our children , '' he said . \n`` We are quite upset about the senseless loss of lives . '' \nZawiya 's residents are free to do as they like , though there will be consequences , he said . \n`` If you want to pit against one another , then it 's up to you , '' he said . \n`` But the borders of the city will be sealed in order to stop it from spreading elsewhere . '' \nHe added , `` How can such lunatic youth cause such anarchy ? '' \nGadhafi said Libya has peaceful ways for its citizens to address their grievances . \n`` We are not like Egypt or Tunisia , '' he said , referring to two countries that have ousted their leaders in recent weeks . \n`` Here , the authority is in the hands of the people . \nYou can change your authority , just make committees . \nAnd if you think they are corrupt , take them to court . \nIn an apparent allusion to calls for government officials to be held accountable for violence against Libyan civilians , Gadhafi said it is bin Laden who should be prosecuted . \n`` He 's responsible for any acts of murder or sabotage , '' Gadhafi said . \nHe accused foreigners of fomenting the discontent . \n`` These acts can not happen by Libyan men , '' he said . \n`` No Libyan of any background would go into this , join these acts of sabotage . '' \nSome of the people involved in the opposition , he said , were detained by the United States in Guantanamo . \nFinally , he expressed confidence that all will end up will for his regime . \n`` I believe Zawiya will toe the line , '' he said , then directed his final comment to the city 's residents themselves . \n`` Please live up to my expectations , people of Zawiya . '' \nA resident of Tripoli who said she was too afraid to give her name for fear of retribution , called Kadhafi 's speech `` crazy . '' \n`` We 're all in our houses like we 're sitting in jail , '' she said . \n`` We ca n't go outside or we get shot . \nWe hear the bullets . '' \nShe called for other nations to impose a no-fly zone so that Kadhafi would not be able to fly in mercenaries . \nViolence occurred elsewhere too Thursday . \nA formerly pro-government newspaper in Libya reported Thursday that African mercenaries were shooting at unarmed civilians in Tajura , about 25 miles east of Tripoli . \nCNN could not confirm the report . \nTen days into protests that have resulted in his loss of control of eastern Libya and led members of his government to defect , Gadhafi faced new international pressure Thursday . \nSwitzerland ordered that his assets , and those of his entourage , be frozen , the Swiss Foreign Ministry said . \nGadhafi 's characteristically rambling remarks followed reports that anti-government forces had gained control of Zawiya . \nAt the hospital , a woman who said her son had been shot told CNN , `` Blood is all over the streets . '' \nWe ca n't go outside or we get shot . \nWe hear the bullets . \nThe woman said unarmed people had been fired on indiscriminately . \n`` We want to call all human beings : Zawiya is finished , '' she said . \n`` The people -LRB- are -RRB- finished . \nThe people -LRB- are -RRB- dying .

'' \nThe hospital in Zawiya is `` a disaster , '' she said , adding that some shooters had entered the hospital and insisted that no one was killed . \nCNN could not confirm reports for many areas in Libya . \nThe Libyan government maintains tight control of communications and has not responded to repeated requests for access to the country . \nCNN has interviewed numerous witnesses by phone . \nMisrata -- sometimes spelled Misurata -- is in the hands of the opposition , who have driven out the mercenaries , witnesses and media reports said . \nIt is the country 's third-largest city and is east of Tripoli . \nWitnesses and reports also said the town of Az Zintan was under opposition control . \nThe opposition already controls Libya 's second-largest city , Benghazi , where crowds cheered as international journalists drove through . \nThe only shooting that could be heard was celebratory gunfire . \nMen in their 20s were guarding the city with shotguns , clubs or hunting knives . \nBut Tripoli was a different story . \nGunfire erupted at dawn Thursday as chanting crowds dispersed . \nGovernment security forces were tightening their grip on the capital , according to sources . \nIn one neighborhood , no one was allowed in or out . \n`` There 's nobody walking in the street , nobody is trying to get out , even to look through the window , '' said a resident who , for security reasons , did not want to be identified . \n`` It 's a little scary .

{"id": "240", "time": "2011-02-25", "text": "New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Libyan President Moammar Gadhafi 's embattled regime ca n't survive , and the United States should call on him to resign , says analyst Fareed Zakaria . \nIn the wake of an uprising that has put anti-Gadhafi forces in control of Benghazi and other Libyan territory , President Barack Obama spoke Thursday with the heads of other Western countries on a coordinated response to the crisis , according to the White House . \nThe president has condemned the violence in Libya , and the United States is seeking to evacuate its citizens . \nAmerican officials have said sanctions and a no-fly zone were among options being discussed to try to stop the Libyan government from attacking protesters . \nZakaria said in an interview that he does n't believe sanctions would work . \n`` The one thing that would make a difference is if the president of the United States called for his ouster , '' Zakaria said . \n`` And it would make a difference mostly to the opposition , to the anti-Gadhafi forces , and I think they would be tremendously emboldened . '' \nThe author and host of CNN 's `` Fareed Zakaria GPS '' spoke to CNN on Thursday . \nHere is an edited transcript : CNN : Where are events headed in Libya ? \nZakaria : I think Gadhafi ca n't last . \nThe unusual thing about Libya is that it 's a very large country with a very small population , but the population is actually concentrated very narrowly along the coast . \nSo when you hear these stories about cities on the coast being moved over to the anti-Gadhafi forces , this is increasingly most of the country . \nI think Gadhafi is holed up in Tripoli asking to be treated like a constitutional monarch , so it feels as though these are the last days . \nUnless he really surrenders , it could be bloody but I think the end is preordained . \nCNN : Why do you think the Libyan military wo n't rally to his side ? \nZakaria : That 's the real question , but I think the military wo n't rally to his side because they see the writing on the wall . \nThey see that the only way to keep this regime in power would be a wholesale massacre of thousands or tens of thousands of Libyans . \nI ca n't believe they would do that or that ultimately the world would let it happen . \nAt some point there is going to be a crack in the regime , at some point some general or the head of the intelligence service is going to turn and at that point , when the regime cracks , I think then it crumbles . \nCNN : What opportunities and difficulties does this present for the United States ? \nZakaria : Well I 'm a bit puzzled by the Obama administration 's somewhat cautious approach here . \nI supported the way in which they handled Egypt and Bahrain . \nI think in both cases , they had longstanding allies that they had very good relations with . \nThey were trying to make sure there was some stability and continuity . \nThe Egyptians had been very good on most foreign policy issues the United States cared about , from fighting al Qaeda to making peace with Israel . \nIn Bahrain , you had not only an important American ally but also a country that hosts a very important naval base and also a somewhat reformist policy . \nGadhafi , for all his comical aspects , has been one of the most thuggish , brutal , repressive dictators in the world . \nBut here you have an anti-American rogue state , the principal state sponsor of terrorism for decades , that was under sanctions and international isolation for years and with a dictator who ruled his people in the most brutal manner possible . \nGadhafi , for all his comical aspects , has been one of the most thuggish , brutal , repressive dictators in the world . \nI do n't see why the administration ca n't push harder and be more forceful in its policy on Libya . \nCNN : The suggestion has been made that the reason is a fear that Americans trying to leave Libya would be taken hostage . \nZakaria : If that 's the case perhaps it 's valid , but the truth of the matter is that they took a stronger line against Mubarak than they have taken against Gadhafi . \nThey made clear they thought there needed to be a regime change in Egypt , there needed to be a political transition , a fundamental change , whereas in Libya all they have asked for is an end to the violence . \nIf the president of the United States were to get to the podium and say we believe that the regime in Libya needs to change , that Gadhafi needs to resign , that would be a very important moral signal , and would , I think , give a huge boost to the anti-Gadhafi forces . \nAll this talk about sanctions and international coordination is meaningless . \nLibya has been under sanctions most of the last 35 years . \nThis is a regime that could n't care less about that . \nThey get their money from oil revenues , they do n't trade much with the world . \nThis is where Libya is different than Egypt and Tunisia . \nZakaria : Both of them had active trading relations with the rest of the world , particularly Europe . \nIn Egypt 's case , they are heavily dependent on tourism , so they cared about the international community . \nI do n't think Gadhafi does at all , he 's never seemed to care in the past when he was not even threatened . \nI do n't think he does now . \nCNN : In recent years , the west has agreed to improved relations with Libya in return for concessions by Gadhafi . \nHow does that look in the light of the latest developments ? \nZakaria : The way Gadhafi has been willing to slaughter his own people highlights what has always been a central feature of his reign which has been a completely callous attitude toward human life -- whether it was sponsoring terrorist attacks against Americans , or sponsoring terrorism in the region . \nCNN : So should the United States and the United Kingdom have reached an accommodation with him years ago -- or should they have been focused on regime change ? \nZakaria : That 's a tough one . \nLook he was giving up his nuclear program . \nThat was a very worthwhile diplomatic effort the United States was engaged in . \nImagine if Gadhafi had nuclear weapons or even a nuclear program today how much greater the anxieties would be . \nIn order to get him to give up his nuclear program , he wanted something in return . \nNow we can have a debate about the precise nature of those negotiations and whether he was given too much , but in general I think it was a good thing that we got him to abandon his nuclear program . \nWatch Fareed Zakaria GPS Sundays at 10am and 1pm ET . \nFor the latest from Fareed Zakaria GPS click here . \n"}

'' \nRasmussen said NATO bombing has saved lives in Libya , and that the alliance has the resources to extend its military mission for another 90 days past the end of June . \nIt is time to start planning for what to do after Gadhafi 's departure `` because Gadhafi 's reign of terror is coming to an end , '' he said . \nPressed by reporters on why airstrikes would be able to dislodge Gadhafi when `` the history of the last 30 years '' shows that air attacks alone do not win wars , Rasmussen offered no clear answer , saying only , `` We have no intentions to put troops on the ground . '' \nFor his part , even as NATO airstrikes bombarded his Tripoli compound , Gadhafi vowed Tuesday that `` we will not surrender . '' \n`` I am now speaking as planes and bombs fall around me , '' Gadhafi said in a live audio broadcast on state television . \n`` But my soul is in God 's hand . \nWe will not think about death or life . \nWe will think about the call of duty . '' \nThe Gadhafi compound was under `` intensive continuous bombardment , '' according to state TV , which reported buildings and infrastructure were destroyed . \nBut government spokesman Musa Ibrahim said the allied campaign `` is failing miserably . '' \n`` No one has the right to shape Libya 's future except for Libyans , '' he said . \nIbrahim said Tuesday 's morning blasts hit the popular guard compound and the revolution compound , which are military barracks near Gadhafi 's Bab al-Aziziya compound . \nThe spokesman said attacks Tuesday and Wednesday hit state television buildings , killing two people and wounding 16 . \n`` We did not target or hit the Libyan broadcast facilities . \nWhat we did target was the military intelligence headquarters in downtown Tripoli , '' the alliance said . \n`` The story coming from Libyan officials that we targeted and hit the state broadcaster 's building is bogus .

{"id": "138", "time": "2011-06-08", "text": "By Micah Zenko - Special to CNN In the Washington Post , columnist Anne Applebaum asks - though does not directly answer - the important question , What to do About Libya s Stalemate ? \nOne position that she entertains is the notion that a stalemate is tolerable , and that it might even work . \nA steady but relentless bombing campaign , generous humanitarian aid and training for the rebels , a bit of patience , and we re done with Gaddafi without too much fuss or boots on the ground . \nWestern -LRB- or certainly Arab League -RRB- political leaders might not discuss Libya often these days , but a stalemated civil war there is seriously problematic for five reasons : First , people are dying and the situation could worsen . \nBefore the civil war erupted , the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court , Luis Moreno-Ocampo , estimated that 500 to 700 persons had been killed in February alone when Libyan security forces had fired live ammunition . \nSince then , deaths overwhelmingly committed by the regime have escalated though leveled off . \nA Libyan rebel spokesperson estimated two weeks ago that at least 15,000 people had been killed , but reports of civilian deaths at the hands of regime forces have all but disappeared . \nGiven the motivations for revenge among both sides , however , the lull in violence directed at civilians could be short lived . \nAs the UN s International Commission of Inquiry on Libya concluded in its report last week , The Commission reached the conclusion that crimes against humanity and war crimes have been committed by the Government forces of Libya , and did find some acts which would constitute war crimes by opposition forces . \nSecond , one-sixth of the Libyan population of six million has been displaced . \nApproximately 920,000 expatriate workers in Libya were forced to return to their home countries , with some 250,000 having since returned . \nSub-Saharan African workers have been targeted by rebel forces for arbitrary search and detention , as well as cruel and inhuman mistreatment . \nAs the International Commission of Inquiry report revealed : The most serious attacks on migrant workers appear to have been linked to a suspicion that such persons were mercenaries on the basis of their national origin or skin color . \nAccording to UNHCR , at least another 100,000 people are believed to be internally displaced , though few aid agencies have a good picture of the situation in the Nafusa Mountains . \nThird , humanitarian assistance is needed . \nApplebaum identifies generous humanitarian aid as one precondition for stalemate giving way to success . \nHowever , the international community has not been generous so far . \nThe UN issued its latest appeal for $ 407 million of critically needed humanitarian aid three weeks ago . \nAs of today , all of the UN aid agencies in Libya have received less than half of the required funding in the form of either actual cash or pledges . \nIn much of the eastern part of the country , the aid situation has stabilized and commercial markets are functioning . \nNevertheless , as a UNHCR spokesperson stated today : An aid crisis could be looming It is apparent that the combined impact of protracted conflict and sanctions are eroding the government s ability to effectively deliver assistance . \nFuel shortages are compounding the worsening humanitarian situation throughout the country . \nAt one gas station in Tripoli , the lines stretched over five miles . \nFourth , most children are not attending school . \nThe National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- refuses to reopen schools . \nEducation officials from the NTC have said that schools will only reopen once Gadhafi has fallen , the curriculum is rewritten , and teachers sympathetic to the regime have been purged . \nIn the meantime , the NTC has put children to work cleaning streets , working as traffic cops and dishing up army rations to rebel soldiers , according to Dawn newspaper . \nMeanwhile , the UN s International Commission of Inquiry reports that both government and opposition forces have used child soldiers in violation of international humanitarian law . \nFinally , history and vast amounts of academic research demonstrate that the political upheaval caused by sustained civil wars decreases almost all socio-economic indicators , makes the eruption of post-conflict violence -LRB- including genocide and mass atrocities -RRB- much more likely , and often produces violence for export . \nOn the latter point , some officials , such as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , believe that Libya could become a breeding ground for Al Qaeda . \nAs she testified before Congress in early March : Many of the Al Qaeda activists in Afghanistan and later in Iraq came from Libya and came from eastern Libya , which is now the so-called free area of Libya One of our biggest concerns is Libya descending into chaos and becoming a giant Somalia . \nThe possibility of Al Qaeda or its affiliates establishing a foothold in Libya has been overblown . \n-LRB- One of the NTC s unbelievably one-sided public opinion polls asked Does Al Qaeda play a role in the 17th February Revolution ? \nAllegedly , 94 percent of respondents said no. -RRB- Nevertheless , as the civil war stalemate

civil war . \nJune 9 , 2011 at 11:32 am | Reply Peole keep complaining that the Nato mission in Libya is unjust and going too far but what people keep forgetting is that this civil war started simply because Moammar Ghadaffi decided to attack and kill peaceful demonstrators who were asking for social changes . \nGhadaffi stated from the get go that Al qaeda was invading his country and behind the unrest in Libya but if so , Al Aqeda in Libya sure did n't fire the first shot . \nNo , it was the Libyan military that fired the first shot and it was the Libyan military that started the civil unrest , the exodust and the humanitarian catastrophe and the bloodshed . \nRecently a Libyan government spokesman argues that the Libyan people are the ones who should be deciding Libya 's future and not Nato . \nAnd while I could n't agree with his statement more , I believe that is exactly what the Libyan people were trying to do at the getgo when the Libyan government started to attack and murder them . \nAnd while the politicians in Washington continue to criticize this administration 's involvement in Libya , I believe that it must be noted that the Libyan unrest may have been resolved a lvery ong time ago if only the right wing radicals in Washington would allow president Obama to do his job . \nAnd unfortunately , because of the widespread and ongoing criticism by the gop over US involvement in this UN mandated mission in Libya , president Obama had to prematurely scaleback our military involvement and give the lead way to Nato . \nAnd maybe its the division in Washington that is encouraging Moammar Ghadaffi to try to hold on to power believing at the end , the gop would help him prevail . \nThat is the Party of No , the republican enemy of our state . \nJust imagine if John Boehner and the hardline radicals in the gop knew about our mission to kill Bin Laden way in advance . \nPerhaps Bin Laden would still be alive today simply because John Boehner and the gop probably would have tipped he and the Pakistan government off . \nBut at the end , democracy prevailed and America prevailed because president Obama is the most articulate and the most intelligent commander in chief and president America ever had . \nJune 9 , 2011 at 11:55 am | Reply Another right-wing idiot here vomiting his ignorance on this web page . \nIt never ends !!!

'' \nThen during the same period a year ago , who can forget Jim Bunning of Kentucky , blocking a jobs bill that brought a very important highway construction project in Washington DC and surrounding arears to an abrut halt as workers were told to pack up and go home . \nAnd this defiant and selfish stance by Jim Bunning also put a hault to a very important unemployment and health insurance coverage for hundreds of thousands of unemployed and struggling Americans affected by this recession the GOP caused with their failed and misguided economic policies . \nAnd Mr. Bunning argument for his stance was because he felt that the president was inflating the national deficit while he and his party sarcastically stressed `` fiscal responsibility '' once more . \nThen when the president introduced the rail project slated for Florida , Florida 's governor turned down this project , arguing that he was concerned that federal funding may have exceeded the cost of the project . \nAnd in the process of rejecting this project , thousands of prospective American jobs got automatically canceled . \nYet , the GOP still keep asking sarcastically `` where are the jobs . '' \nThen remember the oil spill desaster ? \nWell , when president Obama took office and appropriated federal funds to aid American states afflicted by the recession , Louisiana governor Bobby Jindel said his state did n't need any aid . \nBut when small businesses were affected by the oil spill desaster desaster , Governor Jindel was the first to argue that federal aid was not forth coming and he and the GOP sternly criticized the president and accused the president of not holding BP responsible for compensation the victims in the gulf . \nBut when the president got BP to set up a 20 billion dollar fund to compensate the victims , Rep Joe Barton of Texas accused the president of `` a shake down '' of BP . \nAs they say , damn if you do , damn if you do n't . \nAnd when it comes to foreign affairs , the GOP has been against America too . \nFor example , when the president set a deadline in 2009 to bring our troops home from Iraq , the GOP argued that the president was sending the wrong message to the enemy , although the enemy is question never existed before our illegitimate invasion and destabilizing of Iraq . \nThe same is to be said of Afghanistan and today we are still suffering casualties in Afghanistan because that war was prolonged to begin the Iraqi war . \nAnd since the Libyan mission , many in congress have asked what is the mission in Libya and what is the end game in Libya ? \nHowever , my question to the critics is when is the end game in Iraq and Afghanistan and what is the mission there ? \nAnd where are the WMD 's ? \nFurthermore , let me add that while many in congress criticize the Obama administration for our involvement in Libya by asking what is the end game there , it was president Obama who had to decide the end game for both the Iraq and Afghan wars a decade later when he set a deadline to begin troop withdrawal and the president has kept to his promise as troop withdrawal from Iraq began a few months ago . \nRemember the crisis in Egypt ? \nYea , the GOP and the mainstream media argued that president Obama was n't doing enough to defuse that crisis although the president had publicly called on Hosni Mubarak repeatedly to work towards a speedy transion and democratic changes . \nAnd at the end of the day , while some in the GOP and mainstream media argued that president Obama was not doing enough to help thye people of Egypt , others like Newt Gingrich argued that president Obama was betraying a friend in Hosni Mubarak and supporting a terrorist group , the Muslim Brotherhood by calling on Hosni Mubarak to cater to the demonstrators ' demands . \nAnd at the onset of the Libyan crisis , the GOP and the mainstream media accused the president of dragging his feet and not coming to the aid of the Libyan people who they said were being slaughtered by Ghadaffi . \nBut when the president intervened with military intervention via a legal unilateral UN mandate , the same GOP and the mainstream media without a sense of moral integrity and common decency , deliberately flipped flopped on the issue and accused the president of rushing to war in Libya . \nNow they say that president Obama is not doing enough to defuse the crises in Yemen and Seria . \nYou 've got to be kidding right ? \nNo , I do n't deslike the Republicans in America but I deslike the fact that they are anti-America and their only wish seems to be wanting to see the president of the United States and the country fail because they have a problem with the color of the president 's skin . \nI 'm not for or against any political party in Washington , I 'm just for America . \nIts that plain and simple . \nIt 's either you 're for America or against America and so far , the GOP and the mainstream republican owned and operated media and press seem to be enemies of the state . \nJune 9 , 2011 at 2:54 pm | Reply June 9 , 2011 at 3:17 pm | Reply Excellent Joe , its totally relevant to the article , and truthful . \nJune 9 , 2011 at 3:28 pm | Reply June 9 , 2011 at 3:36 pm | Reply These right-wing nutjobs do come out of the woodwork like cockroaches in a suddenly lit room . \nHow they take up for NATO and President Obama . \nBack in WW2 , I wonder if Hitler and Mussolini had so many sympathizers in this country then like Obama does now . \nThis insane carnage in Libya needs to stop and NATO needs to butt out asap , but sadly enough , wo n't !!!

'' \nFour months on , the rebels are not capable of supporting themselves , McGregor said . \nThey are out of fuel , oil production has shut down , and they have few available resources . \nThey will soon face even shortages of food and water , McGregor said . \nPresident Barack Obama faces pressure at home to withdraw U.S. forces . \nThere is debate , too , in Europe over the expensive air campaign . \nThe war may have been morally right , but NATO , said McGregor , is facing a conundrum . \nPart of that failure was a lack of consideration of the makeup of the Libyan population , said University of Texas political scientist Alan J. Kuperman , author of `` The Limits of Humanitarian Intervention . '' \n`` The fundamental error by the White House and NATO was to imagine that the Libyan people were united in opposition to Gadhafi , '' he said . \n`` In reality , Libya is divided along lines of clan and tribe , some of whom benefit greatly from Gadhafi , and therefore defend him fiercely , '' he said . \n`` Any expert on ethnic conflict and intervention could have told the White House that ahead of time . '' \nIn that respect , said Thomas Donnelly , director of the Center for Defense Studies , the Libyan war has the potential for fallout that is worse than what happened after President George W. Bush declared `` mission accomplished '' weeks after Saddam Hussein 's 2003 ouster in the Iraq war . \n`` To imagine that Libyans are going to come together - is a hope , but not a plan , '' Donnelly said . \n`` It was a mistake to get involved in such a feckless way . '' \nBehind the rhetorical rallying cry of protecting civilians , Donnelly said , has always been the real aim of NATO - to kill Gadhafi . \n`` If you made me bet my mortgage at gunpoint , I 'd say we probably will get Gadhafi , '' he said . \nBut the question is when . \nAnd if it does n't happen in a timely fashion , then NATO risks the erosion of public support for its campaign , Donnelly said . \n`` In some sense , 100 days is a short period of time , '' he said . \n`` But when your political support is so tenuous and thin , and when your operations have heretofore been ineffective in achieving campaign goals , then taking ground forces off the table has not made the war any shorter or any less bloody . '' \nThe Libyan regime has also proven itself to be more robust and resilient than anyone imagined . \nIt would be a mistake , said Donnelly , to assume that killing Gadhafi would mean a collapse of the entire system . \nThe Libya conflict has sometimes been compared to NATO 's air war in the Balkans in the 1990s . \nMany people thought the Serbs would go down instantly once NATO began bombing . \nAnd eventually , it was the threat of a ground invasion that led to the capitulation of then-Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic . \nGadhafi , however , faces no such threat . \nAnd some believe the arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court this week will only help strengthen his resolve to stay in power . \n`` If Barack Obama had thought a hundred days ago that he would be where he is now , you have to wonder whether he would have made the same decision , '' Donnelly said . \n`` How can you tell the American people we 're going to start jumping over the fence and we have no idea where we are going to come down ? '' \nBut not everyone is pessimistic about prospects in Libya . \nAli Ahmida , for one , stands by his belief that the Libyan opposition can defeat Gadhafi . \nThe rebels , he said , have made noticeable gains with the support of NATO air power . \nHe cited recent rebel takeovers of western towns in the Nafusa Mountains and said Gadhafi is more isolated now than ever before . \n`` The Libyan people are capable of fighting this fight , '' said Ahmida , an analyst at the University of New England . \n`` The consequences of this , even though it is more painful and brutal , will have a positive outcome in the end . '' \nIt has not been easy for Ahmida to watch the conflict unfold in Libya . \nBut he is a strong proponent for self-determination who feels strongly that the Libyan people , not outside forces , must determine their fate . \n`` I warned against this from the start , that Libyan public opinion would not like it , '' he said , referring to the possibility of foreign boots on the ground . \nAnd Ahmida still questions the motivation of Western powers and the agendas of exiles who he fears may want to exploit oil-rich Libya . \n`` I 'm optimistic but guarded , '' he said . \nAhmida said the bad news is that NATO lacked clarity in its mission and also in a negotiated exit for Gadhafi , which he said is more difficult now because of the arrest warrant for alleged crimes against humanity . \nStill , Gadhafi 's regime will fall , he said . \nThen the real battle for the future of Libya will just be starting . \nOh -- So there is a war going on in Libya ? \nAccording to President Obama there `` are very little hostilities '' . \nI never thought I ` dd be saying this but I am rooting for Moammar Ghadhafi . \nUntil President Obama gets authorization from congress I consider him a war criminal . \nJune 30 , 2011 at 11:06 am | Reply I totally agree with you , Galtinator . \n75 % of all the civilian deaths in Libya are caused by the NATO air strikes and do n't let the right-wing media kid you otherwise ! \nBesides , anyone with half a brain would know that since the Libyan air force has been virtually eliminated early in the conflict . \nJune 30 , 2011 at 4:12 pm | Reply 75 % ehmm ehmm -LRB- clearing throat -RRB- Where did you get your numbers ? \nI 'm libyan and what you are saying is 100 % crap . \nI would like to see where you get your info ...

I guess that 's something you probably wo n't , but in a war thousands of people will die for sure -LRB- from both sides -RRB- but the outcome at least will end all the killings . \nGadhafi 's people are telling everyone that NATO is killing more so NATO gets out . \nNow , I 'm not a big supporter of NATO either because I do n't trust their interests , but as long as Gadhafi dissapears forever then I 'm happy . \nBelieve me , at least 10,000 people have been killed by Gadhafi and it is not just NOW , it has been going on ever since he took power . \nThe whole country lives in poverty and people die from poverty while Gadhafi 's family enjoys their billions and makes 5 million dollar parties all the time . \nJuly 1 , 2011 at 7:11 pm | Are n't the Rebels part of the French Foreign Legion ? \nDoubt they really care if civilians die as long as France gets the oil . \nYou can not honestly tell me France has not signed oil contracts already . \nEven the blind can see that , Rebels are puppets . \nI do not support Gadhafi but I the rebels are not clean either , support 1 dictator to replace another not going to happen . \nJuly 1 , 2011 at 8:49 pm | How many male personnel that are in Libya right now that are not fighting for or against Gadaffi ? \nHow many are not doing anything at all ? \nWhy the hell would people even consider to have foreign ground troops to fall on that field ? \nWhy do n't the Libyan men actually get off their behinds and do something ? \nI know a lot are , but if they were to get everyone on board then it would be a finished project . \nAnyways , the end result would be ...

\nAbsolutely , because , no doubt , he would have to be politically consistent with his conduct in Libya now , would he ? \nOn the 1st of July , and after 3 months of bombardment of Libya by NATO , several thousand people have marched in the streets of Tripoli in support of Gadaffi , yet in the words of Cameron : - As I ve said , we will help fulfill the UN Security Council -LRB- resolution -RRB- it is for the Libyan people to determine their government and their destiny . \nBut our view is clear there is no decent future for Libya with Colonel Gaddafi remaining in power . \n-LRB- The world can not -RRB- stand aside while this dictator murders his own people . \nSo , there are no equivalent public mass rallies in Benghazi of any size , and yet Gadaffi s own people come out in mass support of their leader , but we can not forget what Obama said : - Muammar Gaddafi has lost the legitimacy to lead and he must leave , '' and that Cameron and Obama are of one mind . \nAll three leaders are , of course , on a humanitarian mission . \nAnd to implement same , one drops bombs relentlessly on the Libyan people , who then come out in mass support of their leader and demand that the NATO bombing stops . \nBut , as we know , Obama , Sarkozy and Cameron are all great humanitarians and thus they shall not relent from the humanitarian bombing for accomplishment of the noble humanitarian mission of removing the leader who over a million people want , while insisting that a leadership that no one ever heard of before is installed in power to uphold the democratic wishes of the Libyan people . \nP.S.

'' \nHe believe that Thursday 's attack was to regain control of the nearby town Rayayan . \nHe says the east of Rayayan `` declared their support for the rebels a month ago . '' \nThe rest of the town is loyal to Gadhafi and his former head of internal security , Nasar al Mabout , whom Haji Usama claims lives there . \nGadhafi 's forces simultaneously attacked on three fronts , to the north of Zintan firing Grad rockets at the east of Rayayna , and attacking to the southeast and to the east of Zintan , Haji Usama . \nIn previous battles , Haji Usama says , Gadhafi 's artillery forces have taken over homes in Zuwail al Bagul and simply shelled from a distance . \nThe latest attack is different . \nSince the raids began at dawn on Thursday , Haji Usama says he has lost contact with rebels in Rayayan with the exception of one commander who managed to make the dangerous journey to Zintan after his house was destroyed in the shelling . \nAs dusk fell Friday the shelling that could be clearly heard and seen from the roof tops of Zintan earlier abated before picking up with sporadic barrages of fire shortly before 10 p.m. . \nThe rebels say the night-time shelling is simply to terrorize Zintan 's residents into fleeing . \n`` Some have , '' he says , but most are staying to brave out the battle they fear is far from over . \n"}

Moammar Gadhafi had started using naval assets to lay mines and hamper international humanitarian aid , said Mike Bracken , NATO 's military spokesman . \nLibyan officials said , however , that the airstrikes violated the United Nations resolution mandating the protection of civilians . \nAmran al-Forjani , Libya 's chief coastguard commandant , called the operation a `` crazy attack .

Security Council approved a resolution to protect civilians by any means necessary as Gadhafi 's forces try to quash a nearly three-month revolt against Gadhafi 's nearly 42 years of rule . \nNATO and human rights groups said Libyan forces have targeted aid ships coming in and out of Misrata , where a bloody see-saw battle has raged between Gadhafi 's forces and the rebels . \nBut the coast guard commandant denied that his vessels were used to attack Misrata or any other Libyan city . \nA Libyan official who led CNN personnel on a tour of the area Friday said the commercial port , not the nearby military port , was hit . \nFrom the distance at which CNN was allowed to view the area , it was not clear what sort of vessels were hit . \nSix rockets struck in three strikes that hit five coast guard boats and one navy vessel in dock for maintenance , said Mohammed Ahmed Rashed , the port general manager . \nThe port remained operational , according to officials , but the strikes would impact the limited movement of supply ships . \nLibyan officials said the port is the main food and fuel supply line , and they expect the strikes to deter freight ships from coming because of security concerns and to increase the insurance on ships and goods . \nIn another development , the European Union will open an office in Benghazi on Sunday , officials said . \nCatherine Ashton , foreign policy chief of the European Union , will open the office , said the National Transitional Council , which is based in the city . \nThe council , in a statement , quoted Ashton as saying , `` It will be an honor to meet the people who have been fighting for democracy and a better future for Libya . \nI plan to meet key people from the National Transitional Council , civil society groups and our international partners , and will report back to EU Foreign Ministers on Monday . \nOpening an EU office is an important signal of our unfaltering support for the Libyan people . \nIt is the EU putting words into action . '' \nAlso Saturday , Libyan rebels released four French nationals detained in Benghazi since May 11 . \nThe four traveled to Egypt on Saturday , where they were taken in by French consular authorities , the French Foreign Ministry said . \nAnd in western Libya , a government bus carrying three foreigners working for international media organizations -- Phoenix TV , BBC and Reuters -- was attacked by an angry mob in Zawiya . \nThe journalists were on their way to the Tunisian border . \nYijun Zhou , a reporter for Hong Kong-based Phoenix TV , said an angry crowd of dozens surrounded the bus and a man with a knife slashed the tires of the bus , kicked in the doors and climbed aboard followed by five more men . \nReuters producer Guy Desmond , who was also on the bus , said at least two of the attackers had pistols and one had a knife . \nThey shouted at the journalists , demanding to know their nationalities and employers . \nThe journalists were taken to a police station for two hours before they returned to Tripoli to get another bus back to the border . \nMeanwhile , pro-Gadhafi forces have unleashed their biggest attack yet against a rebel stronghold in the mountains of western Libya , one of the Libyan leader 's former generals said . \nAs of Friday night , one rebel was dead and three were wounded , one of them critically , the former commander said . \nHe now commands rebels in Zintan , using the name Hajj Usama . \nThe attack began Thursday when about 150 of Gadhafi 's infantry troops began firing on three fronts near Zintan , about 90 miles southwest of the capital , Tripoli . \nIn response , Usama said he dispatched hundreds of fighters to cut off Gadhafi 's advance . \nCNN 's Nic Robertson contributed to this report . \n"}

'' \nThe Canadian Bureau for International Education , which distributes the funds in the United States and Canada , is worried that the students will lose their status and possibly their right to live in North America . \nIt is urgently looking for different avenues to secure money . \n`` I think that everybody realizes that the students are innocent victims of circumstances way beyond their control , '' said CBIE Vice President Jennifer Humphries . \n`` It is not appropriate in any way to have them distressed or potentially in any danger because we can not find mechanisms to provide support to them . '' \nCBIE manages the Libyan-North American Scholarship Program with the Libyan Ministry of Education and Scientific Research . \nWhile some 2,500 Libyan students pursue graduate and post-graduate medical studies through the program , Humphries said , close to 4,000 Libyans , including family members , are dependent on it . \nIn February , as Libya sank into civil war , the U.S. Treasury Department froze many of the Libyan government 's assets held in America . \nCBIE later received permission from the Treasury to distribute funds it already had for the current academic year , but had trouble accessing any new money . \n"}

'' \nIn Benghazi , the heart of the Libyan revolt against longtime strongman Moammar Gadhafi , a rebel leader pronounced Obama 's speech in support of democratic movements across the region `` good enough . '' \n`` Overall , the speech was positive for Libya , '' said Jalal el-Gallal , a spokesman for the National Transitional Council . \nRebel leaders were pleased to hear Obama call their provisional government `` legitimate and credible , '' remarks that raised hopes of eventual U.S. recognition as the country 's rightful government -- and accompanying aid . \n`` Hopefully , they will recognize our aspirations , '' el-Gallal said . \n`` They will recognize us fully , and we can bring this chapter to an end . '' \nObama : Our message is simple CNN 's Zakaria on Obama Arab Speech Obama pushes Mideast policy change In his Washington speech , Obama pledged U.S. support for reform efforts across the Middle East and North Africa , warning leaders facing popular upheavals that `` strategies of oppression and strategies of diversion will not work anymore . '' \nIt comes amid the Arab Spring , popular revolts that have driven two regional autocrats from power and fueled calls for reform or open revolts in several other countries . \nHe also pledged additional economic aid for longtime U.S. ally Egypt and said the United States and European Union would push for expanded trade with the region . \nThat was good news for Riad Greiss , who watched Obama 's address from a Cairo coffeehouse . \nGreiss said tourism -- one of the pillars of Egypt 's economy -- has dried up since the pro-democracy protests that drove Hosni Mubarak from power after three decades . \n`` We are feeling it 's getting worse , not better , '' Greiss told CNN . \nGreiss , an engineer from Egypt 's Coptic Christian minority , said Egypt 's revolution `` needs time . \nIt needs a steady push , but time . '' \nOn the eve of a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , the American leader restated the U.S. desire for a comprehensive settlement of the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict . \nHis call for an agreement based on Israel 's pre-1967 borders drew criticism from Netanyahu , who called those frontiers `` indefensible , '' but Obama also poured cold water on Palestinian efforts to seek a unilateral declaration of statehood at the United Nations . \nNabil Shaath , a senior adviser to Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas , called the speech a `` half-full glass . '' \nHe told CNN that Abbas would review the speech with all Palestinian factions and present Obama with some `` specific requirements '' for translating his rhetoric into `` a real peace process . '' \nOn Syria , Obama praised the courage of Syrian protesters who have defied a violent crackdown by President Bashar al-Assad and blasted al-Assad 's government for choosing `` the path of murder '' in response to calls for democratic change . \nAl-Assad , he said , `` now has a choice : He can lead that transition or get out of the way . '' \nBut on the social media site Twitter , a supporter of the Syrian revolt sounded a note of disappointment . \n`` We Syrians started this alone and if ur too afraid to take action , we can handle this alone , '' the poster said . \nObama 's passing reference to Yemen , in which he urged embattled President Ali Abdullah Saleh to `` follow through '' on his reported agreement to step down after 32 years in power , drew mixed reviews from anti-government protesters there . \n`` We wanted Obama to directly call Saleh to leave office the same way he did with Mubarak , '' said Saleh Kayyat , a youth leader in the capital Sanaa . \n`` He did not do that . \nThis is wrong , and he is not being honest with the wave of change in the Middle East .

'' \nBut Obama `` spoke directly to the Yemeni people , '' Jarban said . \n`` That 's something we 're not used to hearing , and it 's an improvement . \nBut we realize that President Obama can not give as much to the Yemeni people as we can give to ourselves . '' \nAnd Michele Dunne , a former White House and State Department expert on the Middle East , said Obama 's address was `` a lot more timid than it needed to be . '' \n`` He spoke a lot more about self-determination and reform than he did about broader concepts like democracy and freedom , '' Dunne told CNN . \n`` He has been pretty cautious about approaching these changes in the Middle East , '' added Dunne , now an analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace . \n`` At least now he has said openly ... that the United States will stand up for its principles in its actions toward the Middle East .

Russell Harding , deputy commander of Operation Unified Protector . \n`` Given the escalating use of naval assets , NATO had no choice but to take decisive action to protect the civilian population of Libya and NATO forces at sea . '' \nIn a statement , NATO said the attack occurred after two weeks of escalating use of government maritime forces that had disrupted the flow of humanitarian assistance . \nAll the vessels targeted were naval warships with no civilian utility , said Harding . \nBut a Libyan official who led CNN personnel on a tour of the area said the commercial port , not the nearby military port , was hit . \nFrom the distance at which CNN was allowed to view the area , it was not clear what sort of vessels were hit . \nThe port 's general manager , Mohammed Ahmed Rashed , told reporters that six rockets struck in three strikes that hit five coast guard boats and one navy vessel , which had been in dock for maintenance . \nThe port remained operational , he said . \nLibyan government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim called the attack a `` clear attempt to bring the nation to its knees , '' and said the port serves as the main entry point for food and other critical supplies into the country . \n`` The nation will starve , '' he said . \nBattle in Libya rages on Libya troops using rape as a weapon ? \nLibya 's al-Obeidy : ` My soul is liberated ' Still , though the port was in disarray , the damage did not appear major , he said . \nIbrahim 's claims came as President Barack Obama , addressing a global audience , condemned the use of force against Arab Spring protesters by longtime allies and adversaries alike . \n`` Obama is still delusional , '' Ibrahim said . \n`` He believes the lies that his own government is spreading around the world and his own media is spreading around the world . \nThey have not proved one single charge against us and they refuse to investigate us . '' \nHe added , `` It 's not Obama who decides whether Moammar Gadhafi leaves Libya or not . \nIt 's the Libyan people who decide their future . '' \nThe report of the attack came shortly after at least three explosions could be heard in the city . \nA government official said five airstrikes had targeted the port and the police academy was also hit on Thursday , during which NATO jets could be seen been flying overhead throughout the day . \nLibyan state-run television reported the strikes with a `` breaking news '' font that said , `` Military source : Residential and military locations in Tripoli are currently being shelled by NATO forces . '' \nEarlier Thursday , crowds of Libyans took to the streets of Tripoli , honking horns and dancing in the streets in support of the country 's leader , Moammar Gadhafi . \nMore than 100 people outside the headquarters of state television chanted `` God , Moammar and Libya only '' and other pro-Gadhafi and anti-rebel slogans . \nThe demonstrations were sparked , apparently , in response to state-run television reports that parts of the rebel capital Benghazi were `` rejecting the colonialists and their followers , '' as the government describes NATO and the rebels . \nA group of journalists , including a CNN team , was taken by government minders to see the celebrations in Tripoli . \nAmong the crowds composed predominantly of young men were a number of families -- including fathers carrying children on their shoulders . \nOne woman , who brought her 10-year-old-daughter , carried a portrait of the Libyan leader and said they were celebrating their country being united again . \nMany then drove toward Tripoli 's Green Square singing and honking their horns , waving Libya 's green flag and portraits of Gadhafi . \nBut CNN journalists in Benghazi saw no indications of counter-revolutionary uprisings or protests there . \nAnd the National Transitional Council denied government claims that pro-Gadhafi forces had seized control of the city . \nAnd residents of Benghazi said they had not seen or heard of pro-Gadhafi rallies there . \nTwo months ago , Gadhafi loyalists in Tripoli erupted in similar cheers when state media incorrectly reported that Tobruk and Benghazi had fallen to government troops . \nGadhafi has been fighting to keep control of his country in the face of an uprising that has led to a number of key cities falling into rebel control . \nThe chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court this week requested a warrant for Gadhafi 's arrest on charges of crimes against humanity . \nCNN 's Ben Wedeman and Jomana Karadsheh contributed to this report . \n"}

{"id": "54", "time": "2011-05-27", "text": "By James M. Lindsay - Special to CNN More than two months of bombing make it clear that the United States and its NATO allies are seeking to oust Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi . \nThe air war , however , is not producing the quick result that NATO wanted . \nPresident Obama continues to resist European calls for a greater American commitment . \nHe argues for sitting tight the air war will eventually force Gadhafi from power . \nPublic opinion polls explain Obama s reluctance to do more right now Americans take a dim view of the operation . \nA new Quinnipiac University Poll finds that 57 percent of Americans don t think that the United States should be involved in Libya . \nDemocrats and Republicans are equally unenthusiastic . \nBut sitting tight requires patience that Americans and Europeans may not have . \nIf domestic opposition to the air war grows , Gadhafi and his supporters might gain confidence that he can hang on , thereby undermining the bombing campaign . \nWhat steps could the administration take if it decides that the current air war isn t working , or working fast enough ? \nObama has repeatedly ruled out sending in U.S. combat troops . \nGiven the American public s intervention fatigue , he isn t likely to change his mind . \nSo what might he do instead ? \nHere are five possibilities : 1 -RRB- Seek a negotiated solution . \nWashington could cut a deal with Gadhafi that imposes a ceasefire or sends him into exile . \nThe Libyan dictator looks to be searching for such a deal . \nObama has said it is impossible to imagine a future for Libya with Gadhafi in power . \nSo any deal that allows him or his sons to continue ruling , which is what a ceasefire would do , would be seen as a substantial defeat . \n2 -RRB- Arm the Rebels . \nObama has authorized sending Libyan rebels $ 25 million worth of nonlethal equipment like body armor and uniforms . \nThe British , French , and Italians have gone slightly further , providing some military advisers . \nSending military arms might tip the balance in the fighting because airstrikes have seriously degraded Gadhafi s military forces . \nArming the rebels does not guarantee a quick victory . \nSophisticated weapons require training to use , and that training can take months . \nWashington also worries that weapons sent to Libyan rebels today could end up in the hands of anti-U.S. forces tomorrow . \n3 -RRB- Ask NATO allies to do more . \nObama has pushed Britain and France to lead the air war . \nThey have grumbled but complied . \nFrance has begun dispatching attack helicopters to Libya , and Britain is considering the move . \nWashington can insist they do even more . \nHow much more NATO allies can and will do , though , is an open question . \nThe capacity of some contributing countries is already being tested , and European capitals share Washington s reluctance to wade deeper into Libya . \nSo pushing Europe to do more could strain the transatlantic alliance 4 -RRB- Expand the air war . \nNATO could expand its target list to put more pressure on Gadhafi s supporters . \nIt also could use airpower to support rebel fighters on the ground . \nBritain and France want the United States to commit roughly ten close air support aircraft to the fight . \nThese AC-130 and A-10 planes were used early in the fighting to destroy Gadhafi s tanks . \nTwo months of bombing have destroyed most of Libya s militarily significant targets . \nGadhafi s forces now avoid airstrikes by hiding amongst civilians . \nWidening the target set or sending in close air support aircraft risks killing more civilians and undermining domestic support for the air war . \n5 -RRB- Send in Special Forces . \nNavy SEALs raided Osama bin Laden s compound in Abbottabad , Pakistan . \nThey could try to replicate that feat in Tripoli . \nThe Abbottabad raid worked because the United States had exceptional intelligence on bin Laden s whereabouts as well as the element of surprise . \nPrecise information about Gadhafi s location is hard to come by , and Special Forces wouldn t have surprise working for them . \nA raid that turned into Blackhawk Down rather than Abbottabad would hand Gadhafi a major political victory . \nEven as Obama struggles with how to push out Gadhafi , he has to contemplate a bigger challenge : what to do once he is gone . \nIraq offers a cautionary lesson that it is far easier to topple dictators than it is to install just and effective governments . \nI 've got a 6th option ...

Masri of Palestine as the original Prime Minister could form the type of government needed to both provide long term stability as a constitutional monarchy but also with a leader of government respected throughout the entire combined countries of the region . \nThe over riding theme of the unification is the willingness of each national sovereign nation to re identify themselves as members of a new country for the good of the common whole . \nThe new theme of `` I am doing this not only for me but for the good of countless millions of fellow countrymen so that I might provide political and economic equality for myself and my extended family and tribe '' has not had such an opportunity for perhaps decades . \nWhich leads , if one has not already surmised , the unique opportunity to bring millions of Palestinians to the same goal . \n`` If we wish a better life we are now Libyans -LRB- or whatever the agreed upon name -RRB- and Arabs and we have a chance to move forward under new leadership to create a new future for ourselves and our future generations '' . \nThus a united Tunisia , Libya , Egypt , Jordan and Palestine could become the model for other `` endgames '' to other nations of not only the Arab world but for sub Saharan Africa and other regions of the world . \nJune 8 , 2011 at 6:01 pm | Reply why do n't u shove all that crap up your ass u little prick ... fucking Pentagon agent son of a bitch ! \nJune 10 , 2011 at 3:37 am | Reply Its a nice thought but wishful thinking . \nIt will not last . \nMaybe in 50 years it 's possible . \nFor now Come home let them settle it on their own -- Fix America first . \nIn 20 years Afghanistan will be controlled by radicals and we will be 1.5 trn poorer for our effort . \nWhen we captured Sadam and his cronies we needed to come home . \nIf the Iraq people want freedom they need to do it themselves or they do not deserve it . \nIf they earn it they will hang on to it as we did . \nJuly 16 , 2011 at 4:52 pm | Reply December 18 , 2011 at 7:59 pm | Reply -LRB- required , but will not be displayed -RRB- CNN welcomes a lively and courteous discussion as long as you follow the Rules of Conduct set forth in our Terms of Service . \nComments are not pre-screened before they post . \nYou agree that anything you post may be used , along with your name and profile picture , in accordance with our Privacy Policy and the license you have granted pursuant to our Terms of Service . \nEnter your email address to follow this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email . \nWhat #Pope Benedict leaves behind : Kathleen Sprows Cummings gives her take on GPS : bit . \nly\\/11C7KM4 Poor sanitation , water supply cause economic losses of about $ 260 billion annually in developing nations : World Bank bit . \nly\\/11Bw3d6 3:44 pm ET February 11 , 2013 RETWEET `` Since peaking in 2009 at 10.1 % of GDP , U.S. budget deficit has fallen . \nThis year , CBO says , it will be 5.3 % '' : Cassidy nyr . \nkr\\/12tXrci 12:35 pm ET February 11 , 2013 RETWEET What has #China banned TV advertisements for ? \nTry the GPS weekly quiz to find out : bit . \nly\\/Y4AvJ6 9:32 am ET February 11 , 2013 RETWEET Five Arab leaders give their take on regional issues on GPS this Sunday at 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. ET on CNN \n"}
{"id": "222", "time": "2011-05-27", "text": "By the CNN Wire Staff U.S. provides arms in Libya Russian President Medvedev says Libya 's Gadhafi needs to step aside Russia has strongly criticized the NATO-led campaign in Libya Western leaders and Libya 's prime minister have asked Medvedev to mediate Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has joined American and other European leaders in calling for Moammar Gadhafi to step down from power , a shift that appears to indicate a closing diplomatic window for the longtime Libyan strongman . \nMoscow has been a strong critic of the NATO-led mission in Libya , arguing that the scope of the organization 's air campaign against Gadhafi 's forces far exceeds the civilian protection mandate approved by the U.N. Security Council . \nMedvedev 's call for Gadhafi to step aside came at the end of the Group of Eight summit in Deauville , France , on Friday . \nThe G8 includes the United States , the United Kingdom , France , Canada , Japan , Germany , Italy and Russia . \nThe G8 leaders also issued a written statement Friday expressing support for the democratic uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa . \nThe summit leaders agree that `` the regime of Gadhafi has lost its legitimacy and he must leave , '' Medvedev said , according to Russia 's state-run RIA Novosti news agency . \n`` This was decided unanimously . '' \nHis statement came on the heels of a request from the other G8 leaders to have the Russian leader mediate a settlement . \nEarlier , Gadhafi 's government also called for a Russian mediation , a sign that the Libyan leader may be searching for a way to bring about an end to the months-long war . \nLibyan Prime Minister Al-Baghdadi Ali al-Mahmudi asked for help in achieving a cease-fire and starting talks without preconditions , according to a statement posted late Thursday by the Russian Foreign Ministry . \nDuring that conversation , Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Libya would have to comply with the Security Council mandate and stop any action that would cause harm to civilians , the statement said . \nOn Wednesday , the Russian Foreign Ministry called NATO 's recent bombing of certain Tripoli targets a `` flagrant deviation '' from U.N. Security Council resolution 1973 . \nThat resolution authorizes all means necessary , short of occupying forces , to enforce a no-fly zone and protect Libyan civilians from attacks by forces loyal to Gadhafi . \nRussia , a permanent member of the Security Council , abstained from the vote on the resolution . \nU.S. President Barack Obama , who had an extended private meeting with Medvedev while in France , insisted Friday that `` the U.N. mandate of civilian protection can not be accomplished when Gadhafi remains in Libya directing his forces in acts of aggression against the Libyan people . '' \n`` We are joined in resolve to finish the job , '' he declared . \nA spokesman for Libya 's transitional government said Gadhafi must leave before the opposition could consider negotiations or a cease-fire . \n`` There is no more room for him in or near Libya , '' said Jalal el-Gallal , a spokesman for the National Transitional Council . \nNATO member Spain said Thursday that Libya had sent a message to Madrid and other European capitals , listing `` a series of proposals that could lead to a cease-fire , '' but the allies have rebuffed earlier Libyan proposals for an end to the fighting . \nWhile Gadhafi has been unable to come to terms with NATO demands , there may also be a growing rift between the NATO allies and the Libyan rebels over the nature of a post-Gadhafi regime . \nFrench President Nicolas Sarkozy indicated Thursday that any future Libyan government may include senior members of Gadhafi 's regime so long as those individuals do not have `` blood on their hands . '' \nEl-Gallal responded to Sarkozy by declaring Friday that it `` is only up to the Libyan people '' to decide `` who will remain '' in government and who will not . \nIntense fighting , meanwhile , continued on the ground in Libya , with at least 10 people killed and over 40 injured during clashes that occurred Friday in Dafniya , outside the hotly contested coastal city of Misrata . \nNATO warplanes bombed the Tripoli area late Thursday , with a tribal site near the capital the target of the latest attacks , a Libyan official said . \nFive explosions , most large enough to shake buildings some distance away , struck Tripoli shortly before midnight . \nThe Libyan official , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said the target was the tribal compound at Bab Al-Azizya , about 2 kilometers -LRB- 1.3 miles -RRB- from the center of Tripoli . \nCNN could not independently confirm the report . \nThe site is a former military base now used to welcome tribal visitors to Tripoli , offering them guest houses during their stay , the official said . \nIt has been used as a center for people volunteering to support Libyan authorities since the revolt against Gadhafi erupted in February . \nCNN 's Maxim Tkachenko , Amir Ahmed , Ben Wedeman and Alan Silverleib contributed to this report . \n"}
{"id": "383", "time": "2011-05-27", "text": "A family walks through the rubble of Misrata on Thursday . \nNow that the siege is over , people feel safe enough to come out . \nGet up to speed on some recent developments in Libya and what the future might bring The humanitarian situation will likely worsen if the conflict drags on into the summer The rebels in Libya seemed to have finally taken control of Misrata -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Three months after protests against Moammar Gadhafi began in Libya , the country seems to be grinding into a stalemated civil war . \nGet up to speed on some of the recent events in Libya , what options President Obama and U.S. allies might have and what the next few months may bring as CNN 's Tim Lister answers some frequently asked questions about the crisis : In the past week especially , President Obama has stepped up his call that Gadhafi must go . \nWhat options do Obama and the allies of the U.S. have moving forward ? \nOn the military front , the war in Libya has evolved into one of attrition . \nThe United States is not taking the lead in terms of bombing missions , but the Pentagon disclosed this week that it was supplying munition to NATO allies to help them carry out sorties . \nThose sorties are increasingly aimed at what NATO terms the regime 's command and control functions , and increasingly at targets in and around Tripoli -- in other words at the nerve-center of the Gadhafi regime . \nThe tactic is similar to that which NATO used when it was trying to expel Serbian troops from Kosovo in 1999 . \nIts planes began bombing targets close to the heart of the Milosevic regime in Belgrade , but it took 11 weeks of sustained attacks before Yugoslavia -LRB- as it then was -RRB- sued for peace . \nLibya : Explain it to me In the past week , the UK and France have announced they will begin using Apache helicopters against Gadhafi 's forces . \nThe helicopters will be based offshore and allow for swifter reaction against smaller targets . \nAnd at the G-8 summit British Prime Minister David Cameron insisted progress was being made . \n`` There are signs that the momentum against Gadhafi is really building , '' he said . \n`` So it 's right that we are ratcheting up the military , the economic and the political pressure on the Gadhafi regime . '' \nBut no one among the coalition is under any illusions about the task at hand . \nFor a start , there is the wear and tear on the already overstretched air assets of the European members of NATO spearheading the air war . \nIn London this week , Obama said : `` Ultimately this is going to be a slow , steady process in which we 're able to wear down the regime forces and change the political calculations of the Gadhafi regime to the point where they finally realize that they 're not going to control this country . '' \nWhat impact will the upcoming Senate vote on a resolution to back U.S. military action in Libya have , if anything ? \nThe resolution has been suggested as a way around the thorny issue of the War Powers Act , passed in 1973 at the height of the debate over Vietnam . \nThe Act prohibits U.S. armed forces from being involved in military actions for more than 60 days without congressional authorization . \nThat 60-day mark has been passed -LRB- it was May 20 -RRB- , but there has been no congressional approval . \nIt 's not the first time . \nIn 1999 , then-President Bill Clinton continued airstrikes in the former Yugoslavia past the 60-day deadline . \nAgain , the rationale was that civilians -LRB- in Kosovo -RRB- were being protected . \nLast week President Obama wrote to congressional leaders urging support for the action against Libya but not suggesting his action depended upon their approval . \n`` I wish to express my support for the bipartisan resolution ... which would confirm that the Congress supports the U.S. mission in Libya , '' he wrote , `` and that both branches are united in their commitment to supporting the aspirations of the Libyan people for political reform and self-government . '' \nBut there 's clearly disquiet in Congress over its lack of leverage on Libya . \nThis week the House passed by a huge majority an amendment to the Defense Authorization bill that would `` prevent funds from being used to deploy , establish or maintain a presence of members of the armed services or private security contractors on the ground in Libya . '' \nNext week Rep. Dennis Kucinich , D-Ohio , is expected to introduce a resolution calling for a full withdrawal from the Libyan action in accordance with the War Powers Act . \nAny amendments to the Defense Authorization bill would also have to be passed by the Senate . \nThe Senate resolution on Libya currently planned would not be binding . \nLibya is calling on Russia to mediate a cease-fire . \nWhy Russia and what will be Russia 's role moving forward ? \nIs it likely that Gadhafi is open to a cease-fire ? \nRussia 's stance on Libya has shifted . \nFor the first time it is suggesting that Gadhafi should step down . \nRussia 's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov was quoted by Russian media Friday as saying that Gadhafi had forfeited his legitimacy as Libyan leader . \n`` It 's necessary to find a formula for Gadhafi to leave , and such a step would help settle other issues , '' Ryabkov said . \nRussia also signed up to the G-8 summit declaration , which said Gadhafi `` has no future in a free , democratic Libya . \nHe must go . '' \nRussia may have more leverage with the Libyan regime than some Western countries . \nIt has not been involved in the military campaign and has actively criticized its execution as beyond the mandate of UN Security Council Resolution 1973 . \nIt also has historic contacts with the Gadhafi regime , and was its chief arms supplier . \nRussian mediation would also be a way for Moscow to assert itself in an international crisis in which -- so far -- it has had little role . \nLibya seems open to Russian involvement . \nThe Russian Foreign Ministry said late Thursday that Libyan Prime Minister Al-Baghdadi Ali al-Mahmudi had asked for Moscow 's help in achieving a cease-fire and starting talks without preconditions . \nMahmudi has also suggested that the regime is willing to talk with the rebel Transitional National Council . \nBut there is no sign that the departure -- immediate or eventual -- of Gadhafi is on offer . \n`` The leader is in the heart of every Libyan . \nIf he leaves , the entire Libyan people leave , '' said al-Mahmudi . \nAt a news conference in Tripoli , al-Mahmudi said the offer was based on an existing African Union `` roadmap '' to resolve the conflict , which does not include any mention of Gaddafi 's own future . \nThe rebels have demanded that Gadhafi and his family leave positions of power as a pre-condition to a settlement . \nThe two sides are clearly far apart . \nMoammar Gadhafi has made few appearances since the April 30 NATO airstrike on a Gadhafi compound . \nHave there been any signs of cracks in the support for Gadhafi ? \nGadhafi has been seen very rarely in recent weeks . \nIn fact we are aware of just one appearance , at a hotel in Tripoli to meet tribal leaders on May 12 , an event that was broadcast on Libyan TV that day . \nThat was two weeks after Libyan authorities said that his youngest son Saif al-Arab had been killed in an airstrike . \nIt may be that NATO 's persistent attacks against the sprawling Gadhafi compound known as Bab el-Azizia have forced Gadhafi to move secretly between locations , even though NATO has said publicly it 's not targeting the Libyan leader . \nIt is virtually impossible for outsiders to get a read on the regime 's inner circle , many of whom are family members . \nBut none of those at the heart of the regime has publicly defected since the foreign minister . \nThere have been plenty of rumors about defections -- almost since the NATO campaign began in mid-March -- but CNN correspondents with good contacts within the regime say they 've seen no signs of serious dissension . \nWhat is the status of the rebels and opposition movement ? \nHow unified are they ? \nWhich areas do they occupy ? \nLibyan enemies helping each other Keeping Gadhafi forces out of Misrata In recent weeks , the rebels have finally taken control of Libya 's third largest city , Misrata , helped by NATO attacks on Gadhafi forces that were shelling the center of the city and its port . \nThere is still sporadic fighting around the city , which has seen some of the fiercest combat in Libya 's civil war . \nCNN 's Ben Wedeman reported from Misrata on Friday that another 10 people were killed in shelling . \nAll told , the UN World Health Organization estimates nearly 1,000 people have been killed in Misrata . \nThe city is the closest to Tripoli that the rebels control , but is still 130 miles from the capital -- and the rebels are not yet able to resupply it unhindered . \nFurther east , the rebels have consolidated their control of Ajdabiya and are unchallenged in their headquarters -- the city of Benghazi . \nBut pro-Gadhafi units are still operating around the city of Brega , which appears to be under government control . \nToward the western border with Tunisia , fighting has flared in the last few weeks as rebels have tried to open a second front . \nBut these rebels are not necessarily affiliated with the Benghazi Transitional National Council . \nThey are Berbers from the Nafusa mountains . \nThey control the town of Zintan , but it continues to be shelled by pro-Gadhafi forces . \nThe humanitarian group Medecins Sans Frontieres said Friday it was pulling out of the town after intense rocket fire . \nCNN 's Nic Robertson reported from the mountains earlier this week . \nThe towns of Yefren and Al Galaa , he reported , `` are at the eastern tip of a slender sliver of rebel-held territory extending 270 kilometers westwards to the Tunisian border . \nBoth have been targeted by Gadhafi since they joined the rebellion three months ago . '' \nAs with other areas , the fighting appears at times almost random and haphazard . \nThis is not a conflict where troops are dug in along well-recognized front lines . \nAs for the rebel leadership , it is united in one aim : removing Gadhafi . \nThe Transitional National Council is made up of professionals such as doctors and lawyers and some tribal representatives . \nBut there are other forces in Libya . \nOne unknown is the strength of the Muslim Brotherhood or other Islamist groups , long driven underground by the regime . \nAnd in Libya -- as in Yemen -- tribes are a very important part of the political equation . \nThere have been signs of tension within the rebels ' military leadership -- apparently more to do with personal rivalries than military strategy . \nOne of the worst-case scenarios at the start of the NATO campaign was a stalemate and it seems to be at that point . \nWhat are some options for the NATO coalition under the current parameters ? \nWestern officials sense that the tide is turning against Gadhafi , albeit slowly . \nThat may have less to do with rebel operations than with the broader diplomatic landscape , the pressures on the inner circle through the Tripoli attacks , and the growing shortages that civilians in the capital and in other towns still held by pro-Gadhafi forces must endure . \nEarlier this week there were reports of people waiting as long as three days to get a half-tank of gasoline in Tripoli . \nWhat are some possible scenarios for the next few months ? \nIt seems likely that in much of Libya -- if the conflict drags on -- the humanitarian situation will worsen . \nOn Friday , Amnesty International published a report on the deteriorating situation in the mountains of western Libya , citing `` the growing difficulty of surviving on supplies smuggled in from Tunisia and the dangers of traveling to areas controlled by forces loyal to Colonel Gadhafi . '' \nThe group Medecins Sans Frontieres says at least 30,000 Libyans are refugees in the Tunisian town of Tartouane . \nI traveled through the town two months ago , and it 's scarcely big enough to manage such an influx . \nThere are chronic shortages of water , power and other basic necessities in mountainous areas of western Libya . \nThe long-term economic implications of this war are tomorrow 's headache . \nIn the east , Benghazi at least can receive supplies from outside , usually by sea . \nThere have been reports of sporadic shortages , but nothing acute . \nThere are no signs that the regime is about to fall apart . \nCNN has spoken to regime opponents in Tripoli in the recent past , but few are willing to challenge Gadhafi and none would dare speak publicly . \nThat being said , life is clearly getting more difficult for Gadhafi 's inner circle . \nOne Western diplomat made this analogy : `` It 's as if Gadhafi is on a desert island , and the tide -- slowly and sometimes even imperceptibly -- is gradually closing in , and his room for maneuver is shrinking . '' \nThe rebels are beginning to receive military training and advice , and some equipment . \nBut that wo n't change the military balance overnight . \nUltimately , as President Obama put it in London this week : `` We may have to be more patient than people would like .

'' \nThe station founders dismiss this as a ridiculous allegation : yes , they are trying to spread a message , but it is not about religion , it 's about revolution , they say . \nEven the language choice is a slap at Gadhafi 's regime : from 1986 to 1997 the government banned the teaching of English in Libya . \nThe team is on air from 8 p.m. to about 4 a.m. local time . \nThey want to be able to broadcast for as long as possible , so they are recruiting and auditioning volunteers . \nApplicants have to be able to speak English if they want to be an announcer : many can because they have lived abroad . \n`` My dad , a couple of years ago , he wrote an article criticizing Gadhafi 's regime , '' recalls Hamida Baja . \n`` You know , here you are not allowed to do that so we were targeted . \nMoammar -LRB- Gadhafi -RRB- saw the article and he was n't too happy about it .

'' \nThe attack that began Thursday , he speculated , was intended to regain control of Rayayna , population 12,000 . \nResidents east of the town had `` declared their support for the rebels a month ago , '' he said , while the rest of the town remains loyal to Gadhafi and his former head of internal security , Nasar al Mabout . \nHajj Usama said al Mabout lives there . \nSince the raids began , Hajj Usama said , he has lost contact with rebels in Rayayna with the exception of one commander who managed to make the dangerous journey to Zintan after his house was destroyed in the shelling . \nAs dusk fell Friday the shelling visible earlier from the roofs of Zintan abated . \nBut shortly before 10 p.m. , the attack resumed with sporadic barrages of gunfire . \nThe rebels said the night shelling may have been intended to terrorize Zintan 's residents so they would flee . \nSome have , but most were staying to brave out the battle they fear is far from over , Hajj Usama said . \nEarly Friday , NATO jets pounded Libyan ports , destroying eight of Gadhafi 's warships , an alliance spokesman said . \nNATO targeted the ships in Tripoli , Al-Khums and Sirte after it was apparent that Gadhafi 's forces were increasingly using naval vessels to launch attacks on civilians , said Mike Bracken , NATO 's military spokesman . \nGadhafi was indiscriminately mining waters in Misrata and hampering the flow of humanitarian aid , Bracken said . \n`` He was using maritime forces to lay mines . \nThese were legal targets , '' Bracken said at a briefing in Brussels , Belgium . \nHe did not say whether crew members were aboard when the ships were hit . \nThe NATO campaign is progressing and Gadhafi 's combat power had been severely curtailed , Bracken said . \nBut the Libyan leader 's forces continued their heavy shelling of Dehiba , on the Tunisian border , where thousands of refugees have amassed in recent weeks . \nThe border crossing , through which humanitarian aid is often trucked in , was closed Friday . \nAlong the southern borders , rebels had gained control of border crossings between Libya and Sudan and Libya and Chad and had regained control of Kufra in the southeast , according to a report by the International Medical Corps , which has teams in Libya and Tunisia . \nThe global medical organization said rebel control along the Chad border was significant because supplies flow through there to Gadhafi 's forces . \n`` While control of the entire border will be difficult , the rebels are reported to have a large force in the region , '' it said . \n`` The Niger and Morocco border crossings remain under Gadhafi control . '' \nMeanwhile , the African Union announced it will hold a two-day meeting of heads of state in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa next week to address the conflict in Libya , as well as other security issues in Africa . \nIn another development , the family of South African freelance photojournalist Anton Hammerl , who has been missing in Libya since April , said late Thursday they believe he was killed by Libyan government forces . \nThe statement was posted on the `` Free photographer Anton Hammerl '' Facebook page and followed interviews given in The New York Times , Global Post and The Atlantic by two journalists who said they were with him when he was shot . \n`` On 5 April 2011 , Anton was shot by Gaddafi 's forces in an extremely remote location in the Libyan desert . \nAccording to eyewitnesses , his injuries were such that he could not have survived without medical attention , '' according to the Facebook statement . \nHammerl was last reportedly seen in a remote region of the Libyan desert . \nHe was reportedly captured by Gadhafi 's forces near the town of al-Brega , a key oil town in eastern Libya , that has been the site of intense fighting . \n"}

'' \n`` We know very well that the Russians have relations with Moammar Gadhafi 's regime , and perhaps these relations will be used in the benefit of the revolutionaries in terms of finding an exit strategy for Gadhafi , '' Jalil said . \nHe reiterated that the transitional council will `` agree to any cease-fire that leads to removing Moammar Gadhafi . \nAnything short of that is unacceptable . '' \nJalil said Saturday he has offered amnesty to Gadhafi loyalists who defect before the demise of the regime , but reiterated that there will be `` no negotiation for any solution until Gadhafi 's departure . '' \nOnce that happens , elections and a constitutional referendum will be held within a year . \nMarking what he called the 100th day of the nation 's civil war on Saturday , the rebel leader voiced optimism even given the movement 's financial straits . \n`` We see victories emerging at both national and international levels , '' he said . \n`` We should celebrate what our heroic sons have accomplished in Misrata and the Nafusa mountains , as well as applaud the wide international support for our revolution .

'' \nHe refused to take further questions on the issue , repeatedly stating that Libyan society is `` very conservative . '' \nA group of lawyers and human rights activists tried to approach al-Obeidy 's sister 's house Monday , but were blocked by security forces . \nThe sister 's mobile phone has apparently been turned off , a source with the opposition in Tripoli told CNN , and no one has seen her since the incident at the hotel . \nAhmed said she was also concerned for the safety of her other daughter . \nAl-Obeidy stormed into the Rixos Hotel as international journalists were having breakfast Saturday morning . \nHer face was bruised . \nSo were her legs . \nShe showed reporters blood on her right inner thigh . \nSpeaking in English , she said had been held against her will for two days and raped by 15 men . \nThough her injuries appeared consistent with what she said , CNN could not independently verify al-Obeidy 's story . \n`` Look at what Gadhafi 's brigades did to me , '' she said . \n`` My honor was violated by them . '' \nAl-Obeidy displayed what appeared to be visible rope burns on her wrists and ankles . \nGovernment officials tried to stifle her , but she persisted . \nSecurity forces moved to subdue her , and even a member of the hotel 's kitchen staff drew a knife . \nAnother staffer tried to throw a dark tablecloth over her head . \nOne government official , who was there to facilitate access for journalists , pulled a pistol from his belt . \nOthers scuffled with reporters and wrestled them to the ground in an attempt to take away their equipment . \nSome journalists were beaten and kicked . \nCNN 's camera was confiscated and deliberately smashed beyond repair . \nAs security forces subdued the screaming woman and dragged her away , al-Obeidy warned , `` If you do n't see me tomorrow , then that 's it .

'' \n` Flickers ' of al-Qaeda in Libya U.S. military switches Libya strategy Anderson : Gadhafi opposition badly armed Deby said he was `` 100 % sure '' of the information , but U.S. military officials have not publicly weighed in on the claim . \nWhen asked about the reports during testimony before Congress Tuesday , Adm. James Stavridis , the NATO supreme allied commander in Europe , said he would respond in closed session . \nThere are certainly plenty of SAMs in Libya . \nVideo and photographs have shown rebel fighters posing with shoulder-fired surface to air missiles including SA-7s , the same type fired in Kenya . \nThe SA-7 is a 1960s-era Soviet-made missile , later distributed to insurgents fighting Soviet troops in Afghanistan by the CIA in order to disguise their true origin . \nBut analysts doubt that AQIM has obtained such missiles . \nDeby offered no concrete evidence -- in public at least -- to back up his claims . \nHe may also have an interest in playing up the al Qaeda threat in his own backyard . \nCounterterrorism analysts say that Deby did not add to his credibility when he said there was some truth to Moammar Gadhafi 's assertion that al Qaeda was orchestrating the Libyan rebellion , a claim for which no evidence has surfaced . \nStavridis said in his testimony that only `` flickers '' of al Qaeda activity had been detected in eastern Libya . \nGiven relatively high rates of Islamist radicalization in eastern Libya in recent years , it is possible that al Qaeda sympathizers in rebel ranks could have transferred weapons to AQIM . \nBut it seems unlikely because the rebels ' overwhelming motivation is to topple the Gadhafi regime . \nA more plausible scenario sees AQIM buying missiles on the very substantial black market in weapons in Africa . \nAccording to Andrew Lebovich , a researcher at the New America Foundation who closely tracks AQIM , the organization 's significant revenues from kidnapping , drug smuggling and human trafficking mean that it has the money to buy SAMs . \n`` If , and it 's a big if , AQIM really did get hold of surface to air missiles and transport them all the way down to Niger , their main rationale would likely be to use them to defend against helicopter raids on their camps by French and other special forces teams in the area . '' \nAQIM appears to have already acquired some anti-aircraft weapons . \nGeoff Porter , an expert on AQIM , wrote in the February edition of CTC Sentinel , published by West Point 's Combating Terrorism Center , that AQIM has used its rising revenues to purchase DSHK -LRB- Dushka -RRB- .50 caliber anti-aircraft machine guns on the black market , possibly from West Africa . \nAQIM has been traditionally weak in Libya , according to Noman Benotman , a former Libyan jihadist who is now a senior researcher at the Quilliam Foundation , a UK-based counterterrorism think tank . \nThe group 's leadership is mainly Algerian , and its foot soldiers are being increasingly drawn from the Sahel region of Mali , Niger and Mauritania . \nBut there are signs that its horizons are broadening . \nAccording to a recent briefing paper on Libya co-authored by Benotman , up to 40 Libyans have joined the group in the last two or three years . \nAnd in 2009 , Saif al Islam Gadhafi , one of the Libyan leader 's sons , told CNN 's Nic Robertson that several Libyans had joined AQIM 's ranks in Algeria and Mali . \nAccording to Benotman , AQIM decided to start infiltrating Libya after the fall of the Tunisian regime in January , after years of avoiding the country because of Gadhafi 's intimidating security apparatus . \nHe wrote that `` in early January 2011 , two Libyan AQIM members left their bases in northern Mali and traveled via southern Algeria into Libya . \nArriving in Ghat , a remote desert city in Libya 's extreme south-west on 15 January , they were involved in a shootout with Libyan security forces , killing one policeman , before being killed themselves . \nThis is AQIM 's first known armed operation in Libya . '' \nCNN has not been able to independently verify the incident . \nLast week Sheikh Abu Musab Wadud , the head of AQIM , reacted to Western airstrikes by issuing a video statement denouncing the intervention as a `` modern crusade '' and promising to work to remove it . \nThe SA-7 may not be state of the art , but it has proven crudely effective over the years . \nSA-7s were among the weapons deployed by Iraqi insurgents to bring down several U.S. military helicopters in Iraq . \nWhile most military aircraft are equipped with counter-measures , civilian planes generally are not . \nWestern counterterrorism officials say they are concerned about the flood of weapons from Libyan garrisons now in circulation and the difficulty of tracking them . \nMost are not as dangerous as SAMs , but some just may be . \n"}

'' \n`` As I 've said before , we do not rule it out but we have not taken the decision to do so , '' he said . \nU.S. President Barack Obama said Tuesday he is also open to the possibility of arming rebel fighters . \n`` I 'm not ruling it out , but I 'm also not ruling it in , '' he told NBC . \nIn a separate interview with ABC , Obama said that `` if we wanted to get weapons into Libya , we probably could . \n... We 're looking at all our options at this point . '' \nOne significant problem , however , is the need to train opposition forces on how to use advanced weaponry . \n`` The notion of the gang that could n't shoot straight might be lived out , '' retired Maj. Gen. James `` Spider '' Marks told CNN Tuesday night . \n`` There must be some degree of training associated with arming this force , '' said Marks , a former commanding general of the U.S. Army Intelligence Center . \n`` However , some weapons systems , clearly they can get a handle on and they can use immediately . \nIt 's the more lethal weapon systems that would require training , and I do n't think there 's time to do that .

Gadhafi , '' Stavridis told a congressional committee . \nStavridis 's comments come the same day that U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton met with leaders of Libya 's opposition in London . \nA senior counterterrorism official , unnamed because he is not authorized to speak on the record , backed up Stavridis ' assessment , downplaying the concern about al Qaeda among the Libyan opposition . \nThere is probably `` a sprinkling of extremists to perhaps include al Qaeda '' in Libya among the rebels , `` but no one should think the opposition is being led by al Qaeda or one of its affiliates , '' the official said . \nAl Qaeda has had a presence in North Africa for years . \n`` It 's hard to tell who all the leaders are in the opposition , '' the official said , but `` the rebels do not appear to be adopting an al Qaeda bent or ideology in Libya .

'' \nIt was not immediately clear where the explosions actually took place . \nTo the east , Libyan forces continued to pound parts of the city of Misrata Tuesday , with tanks firing mortar shells and troops using heavy artillery in an effort to retake control of the city , a witness told CNN . \nCoalition planes circled overhead but did not strike the tanks , he said . \nThe day after Gadhafi 's regime tried to convince journalists that it was in control of Misrata by taking them on a trip to part of the city -- but not allowing them into the city center -- his troops were killing and wounding civilians and evicting thousands of people from their homes , the witness told CNN . \n`` The carnage and the destruction and the human suffering from both the evictions and ... terrorizing the city -- it 's beyond imagination , '' said the witness , an opposition councilman in Misrata , in western Libya . \n`` It 's incredible . '' \nCNN could not independently verify the witness ' descriptions . \nFierce battles on the ground raged in Libya as diplomats from around the world met in London to decide next steps . \nMore than 40 foreign ministers and representatives attended the Tuesday conference , including U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and Chairman of the African Union Jean Ping . \n`` The purpose of this conference is to broaden and deepen the coalition effort , '' said British Foreign Secretary William Hague . \n`` We all want to see that cease-fire . \nWe all want to see Gadhafi go . \nThose things are clear . \nBut once we have that cease-fire , we have something to work with . '' \nGadhafi has showed no sign of letting up his effort to crush the rebellion , which seeks an end to his nearly 42 years in power . \nOrganizers of the conference said it will look for ways to strengthen the U.N. Security Council resolution approved on March 17 that created a no-fly zone above Libya and mandated the protection of civilians . \nIt will also search for urgent ways to get humanitarian aid to war-torn cities like Misrata . \nOpposition fighters have credited coalition airstrikes with helping them advance in their rebellion , but say more are needed . \nThe witness in Misrata on Tuesday pleaded for coalition forces to strike Gadhafi 's forces in that city to `` save Misrata from a massacre . '' \nOff the coast of Misrata , U.S. military planes fired at three Libyan boats , destroying one and damaging the other two , military officials said in a statement Tuesday . \nThe Libyan ships were targeted because of reports that they were firing indiscriminately at merchant vessels in the port of Misrata on Monday , the statement said . \nLibyan state TV had a banner Tuesday saying , `` Civilian and military locations in Misrata , Tripoli , Zaltin , Mazda and al-Watiyaare being bombed by the crusaders and colonial enemies . '' \nThe central group representing the opposition in Libya and working to plan a new government if Gadhafi were to fall issued a statement Tuesday describing its `` vision of a democratic Libya . '' \n`` We have learned from the struggles of our past during the dark days of dictatorship that there is no alternative to building a free and democratic society and ensuring the supremacy of international humanitarian law and human rights declarations , '' the statement from the Interim National Council said . \nThe group , representing numerous areas throughout Libya , has been meeting in Benghazi . \nIn the statement , the council vowed to draft a constitution , guarantee key rights to every Libyan citizen , respect freedom of expression and establish `` a state that draws strength from our strong religious beliefs in peace , truth , justice , and equality . '' \nMuch of the statement focused on promises to build a better economy that would eradicate poverty . \nAbout a third of Libyans live at or below the national poverty line . \nThe declaration makes no reference to religious freedom . \nMahmoud Shammam , a spokesman for the council , said the future government would try members of the Gadhafi regime , not `` hang people in the street .

Ahmed Bani , speaking at a news conference in the opposition capital of Benghazi on Wednesday , said his forces are being outgunned by the superior military power of loyalists , spared the wrath of coalition airstrikes . \nThey have been pushed eastward over the last two days after CNN reported on Sunday that rebels took Brega , Ras Lanuf and Bin Jawad and reached a town just east of Sirte . \nRebel forces have now lost Bin Jawad and the key oil town of Ras Lanuf and are backed up to the Brega area , Bani said . \nAjdabiya , which is east of Brega , will be prepared as a `` defense point '' if the withdrawal continues farther east , he said . \nCNN 's Wedeman said the rebels continue to have no effective command and control . \nBani called on the international community to supply opposition fighters with better and more powerful weapons to hold off the Gadhafi forces . \nHe said the opposition was open to foreign troops training rebel fighters . \nBani asked for tanks , heavy artillery and communications and logistics equipment . \nThe rebels have been demanding an end to Gadhafi 's almost 42-year rule in Libya , but they have been facing `` sustained attacks in the face of the coalition bombing '' in Misrata , Ras Lanuf , and Bin Jawad , Robertson reported . \nIn an address to the House of Commons in London on Wednesday , British Foreign Secretary William Hague said that `` regime forces have intensified their attacks , driving back opposition forces from ground they had taken in recent days .

'' \nHe said he 'd told her Gadhafi was responsible for destroying their city . \nMost of the people we talked to had been shopkeepers or business owners a few weeks ago . \nThey told us this was not a revolution for bread by the poor but for dignity , that they were sick of the Gadhafi regime . \nU.S. Ambassador to U.K. talks Libya Building frequented by Gadhafi hit Rebels described the overnight strikes as the most aggressive attack on the port area -- the city 's only lifeline to the outside world -- since this uprising began . \nRebel officials said some of the rockets landed near refugee camps for migrant workers trapped in Misrata , and at least three people were killed and several others were injured . \nThey also said the incoming rocket fire and shelling would have resumed if it were n't for NATO forces intervening . \nSeveral hours after the shelling of the port , NATO warplanes attacked Gadhafi 's ground forces outside Misrata . \nWe heard and felt the vibrations of those air attacks . \nMisrata has been the most brutal theater in the war in Libya , and the frontline in the battle has been Tripoli Street . \nSome of the tallest buildings in Misrata are along Tripoli Street , and whoever controls those tall buildings owns the highest point in the city -- that 's an advantage in any battlefield and that 's why both sides were desperately fighting for it . \nSeveral days ago the rebels finally seized control of the last of those buildings from pro-Gadhafi gunmen . \nTripoli Street is the major thoroughfare through the heart of town , and it used to be bustling with activity before the war , but the fighting has laid waste to much of it . \nWe could n't find a single building that was n't damaged or destroyed . \nInside one building -- until recently used by Gadhafi snipers to fire on the street below -- we saw empty shells on the floor and bullet holes in the walls . \nIn one apartment people had left everything behind when it had been taken over by Gadhafi forces . \nThe rebels may have won an important victory in capturing the main thoroughfare of Tripoli Street , but all indications are that there is more fighting to come here in Misrata . \nBryony Jones contributed to this report \n"}

'' \nBritain said its contingent of military officers will be sent to the rebel stronghold of Benghazi to serve in an advisory role . \nThe team will work with the Transitional National Council to help the opposition improve its military organizational structures , communications and logistics , the British Foreign Office said . \nIt will also help deliver aid . \n`` This deployment is fully within the terms of UNSCR 1973 both in respect of civilian protection and its provision expressly ruling out a foreign occupation force on Libyan soil , '' Foreign Secretary William Hague said . \nThe United States is not moving toward sending military advisers , according to a U.S. military official with knowledge of ongoing discussions within the U.S. military . \nThe White House remains adamant there will be no U.S. ground forces in Libya , though U.S. intelligence operatives remain there , the source said . \nThe official pointed out that U.S. military advisers ' record in past conflicts is mixed . \nPerhaps the most obvious example , the official said , dates to the Vietnam conflict , when the U.S. military 's role grew from an advisory one in the first years into a full-fledged conflict . \nIf the United States were to send advisory troops to Libya , it would then have to provide security , transportation , supplies and other gear , and would have to have units on standby for emergency extraction if the advisory troops ran into trouble , the source said . \nU.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Wednesday she has recommended that President Barack Obama authorize the U.S. government to send up to $ 25 million in non-lethal commodities and services to support Libyan rebels , including the Transitional National Council . \nShe defended the work of the opposition . \n`` It was not a group that had been planning to oppose the rule of Gadhafi for years ; it was a spontaneous response within the context of the broader Arab Spring , '' she said . \n`` These are mostly business people , students , lawyers , doctors , professors who have very bravely moved to defend their communities and to call to an end to the regime in Libya . '' \nIn Libya , rebel spokesman Jalal al Gallal called Wednesday 's announcements by France and Italy `` positive . '' \n`` We are pleased with the results , and I think it 's a prelude to more cooperation , '' he said . \n`` The more advisers we have on the ground , the better coordination we 'll have on the battlefield .

'' \nQatar and the UAE are among the countries contributing to the international effort in Libya . \nLibyan Foreign Minister Abdul Ati al-Obeidi on Tuesday blasted Britain 's announcement that it was sending military advisers . \nIn an interview with ITN , he called it a step toward `` confrontation . '' \nIn the besieged city of Misrata , four people were killed Wednesday as Gadhafi 's forces indiscriminately shelled residential areas , according to an opposition spokesman who wanted to be identified only as `` Mohammed '' for safety reasons . \nAt least 27 people have been killed and 142 have been injured this week , Mohammed said . \nTim Hetherington , a photojournalist who was nominated for an Oscar for a gritty and harrowing documentary about the Afghan war , was killed in Misrata , the president of the agency that represented him said Wednesday . \nAnd Getty Images Staff Photographer Chris Hondros died Wednesday of wounds , a spokeswoman for the photo agency said . \n`` Chris never shied away from the front line having covered the world 's major conflicts throughout his distinguished career and his work in Libya was no exception , '' said Manager of Public Relations Jodi Einhorn . \n`` He will be sorely missed . '' \nTwo other photographers , Guy Martin and Michael Christopher Brown , were wounded , according to the New York Times . \nLibyan Foreign Minister al-Obeidi said the government would consider a cease-fire in Misrata if it was on both sides . \n`` I think the only way is give peace a chance '' through a general cease-fire , he told ITN . \nBut Abdul Hafiz Ghoga , deputy chairman of the Transitional National Council , rejected the offer , which he said would have included an interim government , free elections in six months and reform that would include Gadhafi 's future role . \n`` Gadhafi 's forces are the one 's who 've been asked by UN Resolution 1973 to cease fire . \nWhen he asked for a cease fire , he asked for a cease fire from strikes that are destroying his military forces , and if he wishes to cease fire then we have no objections to a cease fire . \nAnd as far as a political solution with the Gadhafi family still in the political scene of Libya 's future , this is an impossibility . '' \nHe added , `` They have already made a statement that Gadhafi is not willing to leave and that he will stay here and fight until the last drop of his blood , and if that is his choice and that is the case , then the Libyan people will hunt him down , find him and charge him with the criminal offenses he 's created against the Libyan people .

'' \nNATO has said Gadhafi 's forces have also started hiding resources in civilian areas , making airstrikes more difficult to carry out without harming civilians . \n`` Troops on the ground would be able to get a more accurate fix on targets and call in what is known as ` close air support . ' \nThis would make the air strikes more effective , '' said Paul Smyth , an ex-RAF Tornado navigator and former analyst with the Royal United Services Institute -LRB- RUSI -RRB- . \nWhile admitting his surprise that an organization he described as a little `` timid '' militarily had proposed the plan , he said the use of ground troops is bound to raise questions about the original UN mandate in Libya , in terms of what is or is not meant by occupying force . \n`` Some countries have been open in saying there should be no boots on the ground , though I think this EU force would be acceptable under the current mandate as it is not an incursion . \n`` But it would be interesting if they wanted to make this a permanent move in terms of creating a safe haven for carrying out humanitarian assistance . \nThis is similar to what was created to protect the Kurds from Saddam Hussein 's forces in northern Iraq in the 1990s . \n`` It would then become a peace enforcement operation . \nTo do that there might be a case for underlining it with an additional mandate from the UN . '' \nResolution 1973 was approved by the UN Security Council in March and authorized member states `` to take all necessary measures to protect civilians under threat of attack in the country , including Benghazi , while excluding a foreign occupation force of any form on any part of Libyan territory . '' \nHowever the prospect of sustaining casualties on the ground from snipers or roadside bombs -- threats that can not always be neutralized from the air -- would make governments nervous about contributing to this force , said Smyth . \n`` So many nations appear to have gone public already , adamant that they are not putting any boots on the ground in Libya . '' \nHe said it would also be politically difficult domestically for these governments to change their mind and perform a U-turn , even if their aim is a humanitarian mission . \nBritish Prime Minister David Cameron told Sky News over the weekend that the UN-backed mission was clear : to enforce a no-fly zone and destroy Moammar Gadhafi 's ability to threaten civilians . \n`` We are very clear we must stick to the terms of the UN Security Council resolution . \nWe must keep the support of the Arab world and I think that is very important to make sure this is done the right way , '' he said . \nCrow said the EU plan was also constrained by two things : the burden of responsibility and time . \n`` It 's the age-old question of burden sharing , '' she said . \n`` Who supplies the troops ? \nAnd if you 're sending them using the term ` humanitarian assistance , ' how long do you give it ? \n`` There is no stomach for long-term campaigns among the voting public in coalition countries . \nIt could easily turn into a conflict resolution or stabilization mission as the line between objectives becomes blurred . \nIf this is the case , how long do you leave troops there ? \nThis makes me nervous .

'' \nThree members of the U.N. Security Council -- France , Britain , and the United States -- were working Monday on a possible resolution that would include language on a no-fly zone over Libya , diplomatic sources at the United Nations said . \nBut any kind of military intervention could face sharp criticism from Russia and China , two permanent members of the council that wield veto power . \nU.S. President Barack Obama said Monday he had a `` very clear message to those who are around Col. Gadhafi : It is their choice to make how they operate moving forward and they will be held accountable for whatever violence continues to take place there . '' \n`` We 've got NATO as we speak consulting in Brussels around a wide range of potential options , including potential military options , in response to the violence that continues to take place inside Libya , '' he said . \nIn a statement , NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said NATO did not intend to intervene in Libya , but `` as a defense Alliance and a security organization , it is our job to conduct prudent planning for any eventuality . '' \nNATO has begun around-the-clock surveillance flights of Libya , as it considers options for dealing with the Libyan violence , U.S. Ambassador to NATO Ivo Daalder told reporters Monday . \nWhile the opposition has managed to fight off onslaughts by Gadhafi 's forces in some places -- including what a witness described as an `` amazing '' victory against Gadhafi 's heavy artillery Sunday in the town of Misrata -- the regime has advanced as well . \nGadhafi 's forces seemed to make headway in the city of Bin Jawad , where the Libyan army appeared to have control Monday after fighting over the weekend . \nBut in Zawiya -- a city that the government insisted it had retaken -- the opposition still appeared to control the city center , and fighting was under way Monday . \nCNN saw pro-Gadhafi forces moving through the city , small arms fire , anti-aircraft gunfire and artillery . \nAs the Libyan military brought in reinforcements , CNN could see about 150 troops moving into the city . \nLibya witness : Rockets on the ground Searching the Gadhafi family tree Anti-government protesters are seeking the ouster of the 68-year-old Gadhafi after nearly 42 years of ruling the country -- the kind of revolution that was seen in neighboring Tunisia and Egypt . \nBut unlike in those countries , the Libyan uprising has turned into warfare . \nLibya 's foreign minister dug in Monday , saying the international community does not understand what is happening in Libya and accusing certain Western countries of helping divide the African nation . \n`` It is clear now the U.K. and the U.S. are getting in touch with the defected -LRB- people -RRB- in the East , '' Foreign Minister Musa Kasa told reporters . \n`` This means a conspiracy to divide , partition the country .

'' \nWith no clear end to the deadly clashes in sight , U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon appointed a new special envoy to Libya to discuss the crisis with officials in Tripoli , the United Nations said in a statement Monday . \n`` The secretary-general is deeply concerned about the fighting in western Libya , which is claiming large numbers of lives and threatens even more carnage in the days ahead , '' read the U.N. statement . \n`` He notes that civilians are bearing the brunt of the violence , and calls for an immediate halt to the government 's disproportionate use of force and indiscriminate attacks on civilian targets . '' \nDeath toll estimates have ranged from more than 1,000 to as many as 2,000 , and the international community has been pondering strategies on how to end the violence and remove the Gadhafi regime . \nThe fierce fighting has also sparked the flight of Libyans and foreigners out of Libya , with nations across the globe scrambling to help people leave . \nAbout 200,000 people have fled Libya with nearly equal numbers going to Tunisia and Egypt , the U.N. refugee agency has said . \nBut not everyone has been able to get out . \nBetween 15,000 and 17,000 people are still at a refugee camp near the Libya-Tunisia border . \nOf those left , the majority are from Bangladesh , the U.N. refugee agency said . \nThe group plans to start running chartered flights to there Tuesday . \nPresident Obama authorized Monday sending up to $ 15 million in humanitarian aid to Libya out of the United States Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance Fund . \nHumanitarian and medical aid to Misrata , in central Libya , has been blocked , U.N. emergency relief coordinator Valerie Amos said in a statement Sunday . \nShe urged authorities `` to provide access without delay to allow aid workers to help save lives .

'' \nThere were men on both sides of these protests . \nThe people who organized the women 's march said they 're demanding `` fair and equal opportunity for all Egyptian citizens -- beyond gender , religion or class . '' \nAZUZ : Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made a similar point at an event that commemorated the 100th anniversary of International Women 's Day . \nWhen referring to the political unrest in the Middle East and North Africa we 've seen lately , Secretary Clinton said women `` have just as much right as the men to remake their governments . '' \nShe and first lady Michelle Obama honored 10 women with the International Women of Courage Award . \nSecretary Clinton said the women 's courage comes from putting others ' well-being before their own . \nAnd Mrs. Obama said the awards send a message to women that `` you are never alone in your struggle .

'' \nI 'm Mardi Gras , known as Carnival in other parts of the world . \nAZUZ : Mardi Gras is the last day of the Carnival season . \nThis whole celebration lasts for several days , but it always ends on Fat Tuesday , also called Shrove Tuesday , and that was yesterday . \nA lot of cities host Mardi Gras celebrations , and it might have started in Mobile . \nBut most people associate the annual event -- in the U.S. anyway -- with New Orleans . \nThe typical attendance for Mardi Gras : more than a million people . \nThey show up for the parties and for the parades , and those are organized by social clubs called `` krewes ; '' `` krewe '' with a `` k '' . \nTraditionally , when the clock strikes midnight at the end of Fat Tuesday , a group of New Orleans police march down the city 's famous Bourbon Street , announcing the end of Carnival . \nCHRISTINE ROMANS , CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT : It 's not only the uber famous who can brand themselves . \nDigital media , Twitter and Facebook make it easy for almost anyone to create a brand . \nFrom skateboarder Tony Hawk ...

To chef Paula Deen . \nPAULA DEEN , CHEF : You know , you kind of have to reinvent yourself . \nYou know , you have to keep things fresh . \nI did start this little lunch business called The Bag Lady , y ' all . \nROMANS : What about the average person ? \nCould creating your own brand give you an edge ? \nSAM CHAKO , JOB SEEKER : I do n't know how to market myself to get employers to notice me . \nFORD R.

BILL TAYLOR , AUTHOR , `` PRACTICALLY RADICAL '' : Right . \nROMANS : When you walk into the job interview , when you walk into your dining room ... ROMANS : Are we all becoming brands ? \nTAYLOR : I think , you know , being a brand is not being flamboyant . \nIt works for Lady Gaga . \nIt would n't work for you in your organization . \nBeing a brand , as everybody knows , when I meet Christine Romans , this is what she stands for , this is the impact she was trying to have . \nAZUZ : All right , last week , we told you the story about how the people of Christchurch , New Zealand found a time capsule after an earthquake leveled parts of their city . \nWe tried to get you thinking about what you would leave for the next generation to discover . \nWhat would you put in your own time capsule ? \nHere 's what some of you had to say about it . \niPod : very popular choice for many of you . \nCassidy says `` songs contain everything about a generation : the moods , language and technological advances of our time . '' \nLeah would also leave an iPod , but added that she 'd leave `` 20 bucks , because so many people have been tight on money due to the economic status '' of the country . \nShe said she 'd also include a note saying why she left each thing in order to tell people about the world 's turmoil . \nBut , if she could leave something out , it would be the note because history , she says , should n't repeat itself . \nLucus wants to include fast food wrappers in the time capsule . \nHe feels the world is slowly becoming obese from the fast food people eat . \nSierra wants to include a book . \nI thought this was interesting . \nSierra thinks that books are the highs and lows of humanity on pieces of paper . \nAnd finally , Ben says he would n't leave a thing because , according to him , the economy , the violence : it 's just not worth preserving for future generations . \nAZUZ : Really interesting insight , if a little cynical there . \nAll right , our next story is one we think will get a lot of you talking on our blog . \nSt. Augustine High School in New Orleans uses corporal punishment -- paddling -- to discipline students . \nThis past Friday , students at the school held a rally in support of the policy . \nThe students actually want to keep paddling . \nIt 's been part of St. Augustine for its entire 60 year history . \nBut the school stopped corporal punishment this year after the local Archbishop said paddling does n't belong in a Catholic school . \nHe said , `` I believe hitting a child , or a young man , does not build character . '' \nAnd the Archbishop said a study showed that St. Augustine does n't have any safeguards in place to prevent the paddling from turning into abuse . \nListen to this , though . \nThey say corporal punishment is part of the tradition that makes St. Augustine work . \nThis can not be argued . \nThis can not be changed . \nJACOB WASHINGTON , ST. AUGUSTINE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT : You 're not just taking away a form of discipline . \nYou 're taking away a form of life at St. Augustine . \nAZUZ : You 've heard what the Archbishop had to say . \nYou 've heard some of the students ' opinions . \nNow , we want to hear yours ! \nHead to our blog at CNNStudentNews.com . \nTell us your reaction to what 's going on at St. Augustine . \nWe 're looking forward to reading what you have to say . \nBut one thing we want you to remember , on our blog , it is first names only . \nPlease do n't give us any more info than that . \nAZUZ : Finally today , many of you saw it , that PIXAR movie `` Up '' ? \nThis is the real-life version ! \nA team of scientists and engineers wanted to see if they could pull off the movie 's stunt of lifting a house with a bunch of balloons . \nTook them two weeks ; all they needed were 300 massive balloons ! \nThe house made it all the way up to 10,000 feet , flew around for about an hour . \nWe wonder if they were careful of insects that high up though . \nAZUZ : I mean , after all , you could run into some huge houseflies . \nAnd after two weeks of hard work , it 's nice to see the project get off the ground . \nBut imagine if it had n't worked . \nThat would really burst their bubble . \nAll right , we 're gonna take off before these puns balloon out of control . \nBut we are gonna be back tomorrow to float some more headlines by you . \n"}
{"id": "340", "time": "2011-03-08", "text": "When it comes to Libya , the United States is in a very tough spot . \nNot as tough a spot as the Libyan people are in by any means but difficult nonetheless . \nWe are mostly hated in that part of the world . \nAnd rushing to the aid of the Libyan rebels trying to overthrow Gadhafi would be played up on the Arab street as the United States again interfering in a Muslim nation 's internal affairs . \nOn the other hand , it 's in our national DNA to want to come to the aid of people who are struggling to gain their freedom . \nPlus there is all that oil , of course , but that 's a much more cynical view . \nPeople are laying down their lives trying to get out from under the yoke of arguably one of the world 's most brutal dictators . \nWe have the military wherewithal to make their struggle a lot easier , but so far we have n't done that . \nHere s my question to you : When it comes to Libya , what s the right thing for the U.S. to do ? \nInterested to know which ones made it on air ? \nKent in New Castle , Indiana : I sympathize greatly with the Libyan people trying to gain freedom , but I strongly feel we have to learn that we can not direct the destiny of every country in turmoil . \nI think we should let them solve their own problems unless a strong majority in the UN supports intervention . \nThe U.S. should not carry the burden of the efforts . \nThe U.S. should definitely maintain a humanitarian effort but we need to keep our troops out . \nIt 's not our fight and by stepping in , we take the news away from the Libyan people and suddenly it 's our story . \nI 'm afraid history will be critical of our inaction . \nNo , we should n't send troops , however , we should supply small arms , a no fly zone , food and medical supplies . \nIf we believe in freedom of the people we should help the people and make a better name for ourselves in the region . \nWe help every one else , why not them ? \nThe right thing is to create and enforce a No Fly Zone in Libya . \nIt can be done quickly and effectively with the forces already in the area . \nIt effectively evens the field and will quicken Gadhafi 's departure as the Military will have more defections as they see their major advantage go away . \nThe key for us with the Muslim world is to immediately withdraw the strategy when the fight is settled . \nStay offshore , off the holy land and leave when it 's done . \nIf we do not stand for freedom , then why have so many Americans died in Europe , Korea , Vietnam , and the Middle East ? \nIs our government s decision to fight for freedom based on oil , money , or a principle ? \nI think that the biggest problem in this country is that America thinks about the problems of other countries before our own . \nWhat will it take for the ruling powers in our own country to put the U.S. , first ? \nThis nation has enough problems already that we need to deal with now . \nThe right thing to do is give the protesters weapons and leave American troops out of it . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 5:41 pm | The Lybian people have to win their own revolution . \nWe should help with humanitarian aid , keep the media on Ghadaffi as protection of his people , and agree to abide by whatever the united nations decides to do . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 5:49 pm | I wonder what Reagan would do ? \nWe know what he would have done because he did it before . \nAnd , as a result we got a look at Gadhafi 's true character . \nNo I think a coward is more fitting . \nI believe we take out his air defense , gun ships and send a cruse into his tent , and he 'll be gone . \nWe then work with and support the new government . \nOther arab nations are nervous about us not supporting them , but they are more worried that the US has no stomach for standing up to what it supports . \nBush put these governments on notice with the Freedom Agenda . \nNow we need to `` walk the talk '' . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 5:53 pm | The US should participate in a plan agreed upon by the leaders of the world -- no more , no less . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 5:57 pm | Stay out of it . \nLet the Arab nation fix there own problems . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 5:58 pm | A no fly zone looks simple on paper ; however , in reality it means war on Libya . \nI recommend the US does not do anything until there is genocide of Libyan people in which the US should support the UN and all countries of Europe presenting a `` United Front '' That will give Qaddafi a clear message that the world will not tolerate his behaviors March 8 , 2011 at 5:59 pm | I think it 's very important that we do what we can remotely , by enforcing a no-fly zone and arming the rebels , without direct military engagement on the ground . \nWe need to help level the playing field , but understand and respect the attitudes there about us . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:00 pm | The right thing to do is stay out of it . \nLike you said , if we help , we create a bad reputation both for ourselves and for the Libyan opposition groups . \nNo one will appreciate what we do , no matter what . \nAnd it 's not clear that the Libyan opposition wants a secular democracy anyway ... we 'd really look foolish if we spent the time , effort , money , and possibly lives to pave the way for a Hamas or Muslim Brotherhood kind of group to take over the country . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:02 pm | We lost 68000 boys in Vietnam , for what ? \nWe went into Iraq for What ? \nWe armed the Afghans and called them freedom feighters against the Russians and now we call them insurgents . \nLet make war unprofitable and we will make them inpossible . \nTo have our boys come back in boxes for Libya . \n-- Libya March 8 , 2011 at 6:04 pm | We have the military wherewithal to make their struggle a lot easier ? \nWe still have n't managed to win in or extricate ourselves from Iraq or Afghanistan . \nWhat in the world makes you think we could get it right in Libya ? \nGet a clue , Jack . \nThe right thing , indeed the ONLY thing for us to do with Libya is stay the Hell away and let the Libyans sort it out for themselves . \nWe should declare was on the sucker like we should have during the bombing of our comercial airlines . \nIt is high past time that we side on the people who oppose oppression . \nWe need to stand on the side that is morally right for a change , not just the politically expedient . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:10 pm | America is crumbling under a huge debt contracted with China to fuel 2 wars that are still going on , killed millions of Iraqis , Afgans , and our soldiers , maimed as many and displaced many more . \nWe are fighting healhcare , cutting education , cutting social security budgets to our children , elderly and handicaps . . \nSo we do n't have money for our people and we have money for another war ? . \nDo we really want another war on our hands ? \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:10 pm | help them , we help every one else , why not them March 8 , 2011 at 6:11 pm | No matter what we do , people will think it is wrong . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:11 pm | Simple ! \nThe U.S. has watched and worst still , aided Israel indulge in a genocide against the Palestinian People for 62 years . \nThere 's no reason for us to `` leap '' into Libya on some `` trumped '' up moralistic justification or prod NATO into doing so . \nWhere was all this concern for civilian deaths when the U.S. murdered six million Iraqi civilians in an invasion justified with lies and deceit and breaking of International Law ? \nWe need to get past these unrealistic wars of capturing natural resources and deal with the corruption and inherent failures of capitalism which has itself failed the people of our nation time and again while assisting multinational corporations . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:11 pm | We should let them take care of their own problems . \nIf they need our help and ask us to step in , that 's one thing -- but stepping in without that could lead to disaster and yes , us being seen as poking our nose into other peoples ' business yet again . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:11 pm | The United States should just stay out of it . \nOnce again the American government is getting involved within the business of other nations . \nThe best way to handle the situation is to let them solve it for themselves . \nThe American civil war ended up creating a great nation , why not let Libyans have the chance to create a nation of their own or try and change certain aspects of their society they are fighting for ? \nThe US should support morally first and demand that the United Nations act under the United Nations flag and help the Lybian people . \nWe can not police the world anymore . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:11 pm | Give the opposition some weapons to take out the tanks Let the opposition fight it out with the military . \nI think it may even be fair to say ... military does not have the right to use tanks to fight against their own citizens . \nRestrict or remove all tanks from Ghadaffi 's arsenal . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:12 pm | I totally support the U.S not helping this situation ; helping this situation will breed hatred in the hearts of Qadaffi 's supporters . \nEventually we might be looking at another terrorist attack in the future . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:12 pm | Send our new best friends , the Egyptian Army , to support the Libyan rebels . \nProblem over in three days . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:12 pm | It 's very easy , give them some anti-aircraft shoulder propelled missiles and some good anti-tank missiles . \nIt was done in Afghanistan , and if you review the Lybian history they lost a war against Chad in the 80 's and the war was called the Toyota War , chad fighters in toyota 's with Milan anti-tank missiles beat the lybian army . \nDoes n't really take a brain surgeon does it ? \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:12 pm | We should go in as a full military force . \nIf it was 3 weeks ago , it would 've been interfering . \nBut now , that the death toll is at least 1,000 . \nGadhafi is slaughtering his own people ; we should just put an end to this nonsense now . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:12 pm | Let Libyans take care of Libya . \nWe ca n't get involved in all of the worlds civil wars . \nWe are spread too thin worldwide anyway . \nhelp the protesters , put up the no-fly zone . \nare we going to sit back and watch another rwanda ? \nat the very least get them the weapons to help themselves ! \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:12 pm | Ask Americans can you raise their taxes to fund American intervention in Libya . \nTheir silence will be your answer . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:12 pm | Nothing . \nThe USA has to stop being the Police of the World . \nIs n't that the reason we have the United Nations ? \nLet them deal with it . \nWe have to start taking care of ourselves for once March 8 , 2011 at 6:12 pm | The US should do whatever the UN asks it to do . \nIt is not up to the US to do anything , they are not the sherif of the Middle East . \nThey are a PARTNER in the UN , and the UN should get off its DUFF and do something , and do it NOW ! \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:12 pm | First of all Jack , most Libyans do n't hate Americans . \nThey want be be free like we are . \nWe have many Libyan friends\\/family who have been free to travel in the US . \nWe should stay out and let the UN take the lead . \nAmerica is BROKE and If we hate them -LRB- Only the racists do -RRB- . \nWhy would we save them ? \nto rescue the oil ? \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:18 pm | It 's time for us to stay out of the worlds problems . \nLet our friends in Europe handle this one , if they have the stomach for it . \nThey always want us to stick our noses in and then they can blame us . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:18 pm | Ask our British and French and perhaps , the German allies , to do surgical air strikes on the Libyan air fields . \nThis will keep their planes from flying and strafing the free Libya fighters . \nWe can support the freedom fighters with arms and food , maybe surveillance Intel , but not with boots on the ground . \nThis is a good fight , but it 's not our fight , unless we are asked for an assist , along with the UN . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:18 pm | Lets not procastinate regarding the Libya situation . \nThe leader , Ghadafi , must be removed rapidly . \nIt 's sad that the untrained , starving , young oppossition leaders are staking their lives to create a civil community . \nWe , the US must intervene . \nIf we dont , there will be much bloodshed and and further uncivil practices . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:18 pm | We have to stay out . \nIf there was no oil we would not care . \nThe Ivory Coast had a valid election and the President lost but will not get out . \nHe is killing the opposition . \nWhere is the outcry to go in there and support democracy . \nNo one cares when there is not benefit to us . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:18 pm | We should invade Libya like we did Iraq & Afghanistan , tell the world it was for humanitarian reasons , and then tell the American Taxpayers that it is humanitarian to cut their SSA , Education , Food Stamps , Foreclose on their Homes , while the fat cats on wall street laugh all the way to the bank . \nI demand that the Congress show the American People how they are going to pay for any intervention in Libya before they act . \nStay out of their business . \nDo we demand that Israel end the strife in their part of the world . \nWould we have accepted another nation involving themselves in our disagreements . \nHow about the way we treated minorities in this country and having Europeans decided who was going to run this nation . \nMaybe the day will come when we stop sticking our noses into everything that happens elsewhere and start cleaning up what 's wrong here . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:18 pm | The US should not get unto a hot war in Libya , but a no fly zone with our European allies might be the only way to help the Libyan people . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:18 pm | Alan Stuart - Albuquerque , NM What should we do with regard to Libya ? \nJack , let 's not get involved in this civil war . \nWe are hated in that region and our involvement would only give fuel to the extremists and fundamentalists . \nWhy ca n't the Arab countries like Saudi Arabia get more involved ? \nOn the one hand they do n't want us there but when the brown stuff hits the fan they all wake up and cry for western help . \nNo , no more wars . \nWe 've done too much damage in that region . \nWe ca n't afford it financially nor the potential loss of US and Nato lives . \nOh , who was there to intervene in the US civil war ? \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:18 pm | hello jack i think the US should just not get too involve in the gaddafy govt . \nbut if they want to they should instead help out the rebels who are poorly trained and no weaponds . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:18 pm | March 8 , 2011 at 6:18 pm | We should give it some time and MIND OUR OWN BUSINESS . \nIf their own people can not fix it , send in a sniper , WE TAXPAYERS are our of money to support another war signed . . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | Stay out of it ! \nHere we are worrying about our own government having a shut down along with a national debt that we will never get out of , and we 're going to give away more of our help ? \nIf we 're not careful , we 're gonna end up in similar situations soon . \nMaybe not with our president , but with the government in general . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | I 'm afraid history will be critical of our inaction . \nNo , we should n't send troops , however , we should supply small arms , a no fly zone , food and medical supplies . \nIf we believein freedom of the people we should help the people and make a better name for ourselves in the region . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | The U.N. should be calling the shots in Libya , not the U.S. . \nWe have gone it alone for too long and suffered the consequences . \nYou 're right , it is a difficult position but let 's cut the crap . \nThe U.S. can not do this unilaterally , this is no longer a hegemonic world . \nBut the U.S. should participate . \nThe problem is that we need tougher UN actions , multipolar ones , led by strong nations that say `` Hey , you 're on the wrong side of this issue and we 're not simply going to tolerate it . '' \nWhat we do n't want to do is provide a breeding ground for individuals who already feel hatred towards the West . \nThat 's how you prevent your 9\\/11s . \nThe United States is supposed to stand for liberty and freedom . \nAt least those are the words we hear . \nWe all need to remember that actions speak louder than words . \nRight now action is needed . \nBy helping the people of Libya it does n't mean we have to take on another war . \nAll we have to do is help stop the massacre with a no flight zone , and possibly teaching them how to use their weapons properly . \nWe could even do more . \nBut the major thing is to leave once we help them and let them finish on their own . \nHelping them does n't mean we are taking on another war . \nThe countries you say that wo n't like us are n't going to like us no matter what we do . \nMany people today are questioning what the United States stands for -- maybe it 's time to show them . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | Why do n't we ask the Libyan revolutionaries if they want our help first ? \nIf they do , we could use the 30 billion dollars in frozen assets to pay one of these mercenary armies like Blackwater -LRB- XI -RRB- to go to Libya to train and arm the revolutionaries ? \nThat way we are n't acting unilaterally as a nation , but the Libyans will still get the military intervention . \nWe 've been talking wisdom of using these mercenaries to fight our wars for a decade , and now we have a perfect situation to actually use them . \nPrivate mercenary army , rich middle eastern country , using mercenaries here is a no brainer . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | There is no easy answer here ... however it is obvious that at the very least the US and UK should pull together a coalition to destroy the Libyan Air Forces ability to operate at will . \nSecondly ... supply weapons , equip . \netc. to the rebels thru `` sources '' . \nThis will at least give the anti-qadaffi forces the ability to fight while the UN wastes talks it to death ... March 8 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | The Libyan rebels want a no-fly zone ... we should have already done that . \nHow about an airstrike to take out Gaddafi ? \nReagan bombed Libya in 1986 . \nWhat kind of message does not doing anything send to the people of Iran and North Korea ? \nTell Europe to step up to the plate always first to criticize us -- well I think it 's time to step up . \nDo n't they get 85 % of there oil from Lybia ? \nThe President should say it loud and clear '' your turn take care of this problem '' March 8 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | We should let them fight alone . \nIn Lybia there is n't a peaceful protest . \nIt is an all out war and we ca n't interfere and play in Khadafi 's favor . \nThere is n't anything that the Reps want more , but for the US to get involved in an unneeded war like Iraq . \nPlus , we are broke !!!! March 8 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | Call me crazy , but was n't Americas current situation developed via a war against Britian to gain independence and then again a civil war to define what she is today ? \nSure there was no air warfare , but the superior naval forces , organization and weaponry of the era against a bunch of upstart farmers and merchants does n't seem to be that much of a strech of the imagination . \nWe should let the situation develop as it may , our military resources are depleted as it is , a growing national debt , and high unemployment . \nWe have more important things to worry about . \nThe talk of the oil is nonsense , Libya produces a drop in the bucket compared to the rest of the world and our good neighbors to the north have plenty of it . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | The U.S. should n't intervene now that there is a rebel force . \nAiding rebel forces would fuel anti-American sentiment in the Middle-East . \nUnless innocent people are being killed , the risk of collateral damage is too great for the U.S. to get involved . \nMan it gets old always helping out people that usually hate us . \nWhenever someone starts acting up then we , the good old USA , are supposed to forget all they never do for us , and run and save them . \nShort memory too , huh Jack , seems like not too long ago we were duped into a weapons of mass destruction cry of wolf . \nI say let the Muslim world take care of their own . \nWe have enough on our plate right now . \nJoe in PA March 8 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | The right thing is to create and enforce a No Fly Zone in Libya . \nIt can be done quickly and effectively with the forces already in the area . \nIt effectively evens the field and will quicken Gadhafi 's departure as the Military will have more defections as they see their major advantage go away . \nThe key for us with the Muslim world is to immediately withdraw the strategy when the fight is settled . \nStay offshore , off the holy land and leave when it 's done . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | Let 's go in , get Ghadafi , hand him over to the Libyan National Council , have him hand over the army to them , and ask them if they would like us to help them with anything else , if not , than we pull out . \nIf they ask us to help stabilize their military , than lets leave about 300 officers to help train them . \nIf they want help with improving their economy , than we should pay them to build , and have them run , a factory . \nThis factory would produce a new tree growing device , inspired by bird poop . \nIt helps trees collect water , and has an 80 % success rate at growing trees in the Sahara . \nThen they can make and sell these tree growing devices to other desert nations in their region . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | Keep out of it ! \nThe U.S. should Let the Libians have there Civil War ! \nThe U.S. is to blame for there crisis to begin with ! \nIf it were not for the leak of highly sensitive secret documents to Wikileaks maybe all of this unrest and toppling of dictators would n't be happening ... and think about the American Civil War did any other Country intervene when America was being formed ? \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | We should not do anything without the cooperation of other countries . \nIf the protesters have the overt backing of the Americans alone , it will stoke the flames of anti-Americanism . \nWe have to talk softly and provide the protesters with big `` sticks . '' \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | Please stop preaching involvement . \nYes it is probably the best thing to do overall but once again USA and the West will be condemmed for it . \nIf we do anything it must be the last time , lets get off the Oil depedence , lets get out of debt , lets give our kids a country to work with . \nMan , we are so quick to spend on all the things that benefit others but I would love to see most of the money benefiting the USA . \nP.S. -- I am a Canadian observer . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | I say the U.S should supply the rebels with food , weapons , fuel , and traning . \nAlso set upa no-fly zone to protect them , but let them do the fighting . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | Give the Libians the Only thing they are asking for , a No-Fly Zone !! After all said and done , we will look like we just plain do n't care if we do n't act now ! \nThat should be the Only opinion we concern ourselves with !! March 8 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | As hard as it is to witness this atrocity , we have spent our military and political resources so poorly in the last two decades , that we are seen by most of the world as part of the problem and not as a contributor of solutions , we need sit on the bench and hang our heads in shame , because we stood by while old bush and little bush made unnecessary wars around the world and marginalized our ability to contribute effectively to world peace and prosperity . \nMaybe if we had listened to Dr King , who pointed out that being the world 's policeman , would make it impossible to achieve social justice in our own country , who the heck are we to be interfering all over the planet , when we have so many huge problems here at home ? \nLibyan need to worry about Libya and we need to worry about US . \nSo stay out of it . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | Not a thing . \nHow about France step up to the plate ? \nOr , Spain , Canada , Mexico , etc. . . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | The right thing to do is for America to mind it 's own business . \nThe states has screwed up in every conflict since the dawn of it 's Sure , you 've got lots of military muscle , but you lack in military brains . \nWhat about all those other African countries that have suffered far more than Lybia ? \nYou know , South Africa , Somalia , Ivory Coast , etc. . . \nOh ya , I forgot , those countries do n't have any oil ! \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | Offer him and his family 25 million dollars and a ticket to Venezuela and let Hugo take care them . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | The right thing for the United States to do is deploy military resources as part of an international humanitarian aid effort to provide basic medical supplies , food , and basic necessities for refugees fleeing the fighting at the borders of Tunisia and Egypt . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | The right thing to do is what we are doing presently : political pressure . \nPerhaps you 've heard of Robert Gates , who has indicated that the United States has limited capabilities in the region which would make it difficult to set up a no-fly zone quickly , others might be in a better position to help . \nThe French I don t know what the British have in the area but the French and the Italians potentially , I suppose , could have some assets they could put in there quicker . \nWe have a staggering deficit , 2 `` wars '' already in the middle east , budget cutting Tea Partiers screaming for slashing programs that invest in our own citizens , and crumbling infrastructure . \nLet the French and Italians carry the ball on this one . \nHow about we invest in ourselves ? \nI ca n't remember any other countries getting involved in our own civil war ... March 8 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | We need to stand down . \nIn this world of media explosion that documents everything 24\\/7 , it would be very easy to get caught up in the violence over there . \nbut , we need to stay out of this one . \nOur own troops are pushed to their limit ... . \nand frankly , you ca n't spout deficit reduction and then get involved in another -LRB- losing -RRB- military situation . \nWe should NOT be the world 's peacekeeper . \nAnd , in the Middle East , it is a dangerous proposition on a long term level . \nI feel sorry for the Libyan people and hope via NATO , we can provide some help . \nBut , that 's it . \nThey need to fall back , regroup and get some leadership ... and we can not do that for them . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | Would n't it be wonderful if the US could save the world . \nWake up , Jack -- we are broke and going the way of ancient Rome who had the hubris to over-extend itself with multiple wars resulting in its demise . \nHow many more wars do you want the US to fight -- in addition to the already ridiculous ones we are involved in ? \nWhere is the world community ? \nWhere is the rest of the Arab world -- are they too busy praying 5 times a day -- before they cut off someone 's hand for stealing or stone women to death because of perceived sexual misconduct . \nCharity begins at home . \nOur country is suffering -- my son has been out of work for a year with two children to raise . \nHe has good credentials but it looks like few possibilities in today 's jobless recovery . \nGod help us all ! \nA worried senior citizen . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | I think we should sit back and let our European neighbors take the lead in Libya , which of course is tantamount to doing nothing . \nAre we sure Qaddafi is not an American citizen therefore can be prosecuted under American law , as he surely must be another offspring of Martin Sheen ? \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | Nothing will be done by our government or the British government to help the rebels for one simple reason . . \nBP will never allow it . \nAfter all the underhanded , undercover efforts by BP to get the Lockerbie bomber released to placate Gadhafi so they could gain greater access to Libya 's oil , they are undoubtedly telling all western governments NO. . \nWe should , at the very least , provide a no-fly zone , and help the rebels with weapons and training , but BP knows if the rebels win , they LOSE ! \nDo n't expect Obama to do more than make speeches , and dither , hoping the situation , like the Gulf oil spill disaster , will resolve itself and relieve him from having to take any action . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | First of all Jack , most Libyans do n't hate Americans . \nThey want be be free like we are . \nWe have many Libyan friends\\/family who have been free to travel in the US . \nWe should stay out and let the UN take the lead . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | We should stay on the sidelines and keep our soldiers out of harms way . \nThere is no way we should be rushing to help anyone militarily because they are protesting or even fighting their current government . \nMaybe we should stop the ban on showing our military deaths . \nThen people would think twice before always wanting to send the US Military into harms way . \nWe do pay for each and every military combat mission with more then just money . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | Why not apply the same standard for Palestine ? \nUS has to take into account how its action in other parts shows of the double standards it applies . \nHerein lies the hesitation for US action . \nCredibilty is the key March 8 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | Nothing . \nlet them take care of their country . \nWe have our problems to worry about . \nwe are figthing two wars and you want a third one ? \nlet them take care of themselves ! \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | March 8 , 2011 at 6:21 pm | 1 . \nSupport a NATO or Arab Nations Directed ` No Fly Zone ' . \nProvide humanitarian support as needed .3 . \nAbsolutely no sending of military assets of any military ground force\\/support type . \nEnough blood has been spilt in the name of freedom -LRB- Oil -RRB- ? \nThis is a classic case of damned if you do and damned if you do n't . \nI 've always thought of myself as a peace-nick . \nBut when thousands of people are being slaughtered while fighting for their freedom , we should stop sitting on our hands in a committee and make some hard decisions toward getting them assistance and achieving their goal . \nI do n't think the U.S. should do this unilaterally , but we should openly support the cause of freedom and lean on other U.N. nations to come to the table and help get this conflict resolved before more Libyans die needlessly . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:21 pm | Perhaps we should admit that it 's ok to be your brother 's keeper , perhaps we should all accept higher taxes and business owners should agree to do their very best for this economy in spite of higher taxes , and then perhaps we could afford to really help the people in Libya . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:21 pm | The right thing for the US to do is stay out of the Middle East completely !!! Stay home and solve our own problems !! We need a no Cross zone on the Mexican boarder ! \nStop the killing on our own boarder . \nStop the killings in the cities across the US from gangs ! \nStop the drugs that ruin peoples lives ! \nGet rid of all the self centered politicians that say they will do this and that and end up protecting their own interests instead of our ! \netc !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 11 March 8 , 2011 at 6:21 pm | Ai n't my job Jack nor my responsibility . \nI am busy working & paying taxes . \nPresident Obama was elected to handle such things . \nWhat does he have to say about this turmoil that is hurting poor people & hurting the world 's economic recovery ?? Leadership is all about leading , not following the popularity polls . \nI think the US should step in , and help the Libyan people , because whatever the Obama administration may do to help the people of Libya , it wont come as close as the mess the Bush administration did in Iraq . \nSo politically the Obama administration should be alright from that prospective . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:21 pm | There needs to be an international coalition to take any military action . \nMorally speaking though we do need to try and get NATO to set up a no-fly zone . \nUnless we 're going to try to arrest Gadaffi for war crimes or the lockerby bombing , we need to let the Lybians fight it out on the ground . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:21 pm | I think that the biggest problem in this country is that America thinks about the problems of other countries before our own . \nWhat will it take for the ruling powers in OUR OWN country to put US first ? \nThis nation has enough problems already that we need to deal with NOW . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:21 pm | It comes down to the issues here in the US . \nWe have serious unemployment , Rising Petrol prices , Food prices and a two front war in the region . \nCan the US with our policies of Freedom resolve the Libyan conflict ? \nA swift multinational coalition is the answer . \nIf Gadhaffi can not agree to the concerns of multi-national countries he needs to exit , and do the `` Baby Doc '' road , and go to Venezuela or another country that would have him . \nThe US has to use serious considerations before taking Military action . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:22 pm | Jack : It always looks easy from a distance and although we do n't have all the facts , it becomes increasingly difficult to listen to phrases like ... everything is on the table ... we are considering all the options and a hundred other different euphemisms . \nDo something that will prevent the slaughter of poorly armed , poorly trained people who are simply fighting for their freedom . \nWhile freedom lives in the hearts of all of us and has always done so , perhaps the United States has done the most to champion it , defend it and espouse it . \nThose who pursue it do so in great part because America has led the way . \nThey need real help . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:22 pm | How are we going to feel tomorrow , next week , next month when those fighting for democracy are being slaughtered every day as they wait for the world to come to their aid against a ruthless mentally disturbed dictator . \nIt 's not as if we do n't know what 's happening - we 're standing by `` watching '' it happen . \nMaybe Thursday ??? - too late !!!!! One hour more ? \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:22 pm | The U.S. needs to refrain from overpowering influence . \nLet the Arab nations sort it out . \nThis is the time for the U.S. to take the position of the supporting role vice the supported role . \nIf the U.S. takes a lead role in trying to fix the issues of Libya , or any other Arab state with internal trouble , the U.S. will be blamed for everything that does not turn out right . \nIt is time for the U.S. to speak quietly and carry a big stick . \nJames March 8 , 2011 at 6:22 pm | The situation defines the concept of difficult . \nWhile the US must be more forceful , I have to wonder where is the rest of the world in the puzzle that depicts a proper response to Libya . \nOur range of responses is arguably limited by the `` ready , fire , aim '' approach of the `` Decider . '' \nWe should be careful of what we wish for . \nGiven Khadafi 's ruthless repression of meaningful infrastructure , what is the range of outcomes when , hopefully , Khadafi is banished ? \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:22 pm | You hit the nail on the head saying , `` It is in our DNA to want to help the Libians who are being oppressed by a brutal dictator '' . \nI have become a regular news junkie . \nI keep checking and checking , hoping to find that we have done something decisive to help them in their struggles . \nSo far , it has been a lot of `` we are considering ... '' , blah , blah , blah . \nWhat we have been doing is sitting on our hands with our thumbs inconviently sticking up . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:22 pm | Do we want to be perceived as a nation lacking compassion for those who are suffering and dying for a just cause ? \nThe Libyan government obviously has no compassion when they even kidnap victims of their violence from hospitals to conceal what they have done . \nDo we want a post-revolution Libya that hates us because we could have helped them but did n't ? \nThere are things we can do -- like a no-fly zone so rebel forces can move without being sitting ducks for air attacks , maybe arming rebels . \nWhy do we have to wonder what the Libyan people are like ? \nListen to those who lived there , like the American teacher , who says they are wonderful people . \nThey deserve our help and it 's clearly in our long term interest to be their friends . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:22 pm | I think its a doubled edged sword . \nOn one side , we have that part of the world hates us and stepping in would further ignited reason to dislike us because of what we have already done in that part of the world . \nOn the other hand our intensions are to give freedom to those who are oppressed . \nWe have been the acting world police for decades . \nNow when its time to step up to the plate and practice what we have preached we can ?! . \nWe have to step in . \nIts just the right thing to do ! \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:22 pm | I think NATO should engage in Libya and calm the stance of aggression and bring a government to life there that will bring a good quality of life to the citizens of libya . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:22 pm | Jack , we claim to be the beacon of freedom . \nThe reason we 're hated in that part of the world has little to do with religion , most ordinary citizens see us as siding with their dictators -- and seemingly reluctant to come to the aid of suffering masses . \nFor fear of upsetting the despots that do our bidding ? \nHere 's a chance to finally be seen as siding with the people -- and what do we do ? \nTaking weeks to decide if we want to stop bloodshed . \nI think we should take as long time as possible , after Ghadafy has massacred his people into submission , the survivors will really love the United States for not coming to their aid . \nNo , they wo n't remember how Clinton intervened in Bosnia to stop the massacre in Europe . \nThey will really thank us for watching their children die as we debate what to do ! \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:22 pm | Our president said Gadhafi has to go ; however , no one is willing to do the no flying zone which is needed to help the Libyan people . \nI wish our pesident will act and not wait until Gadhafi kills more Libyans . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:23 pm | First I am willing to pay 5.00 for gas here to help freedom in the Middle East and Africa . \nGadhafi funds wars all over the world , so ending his rule helps the world and not just Lybia . \nOur President can not tell Gadhafi to step down and then do nothing . \nWhy are we hated in the MIddle east -- maybe because we are only there for the Oil and money . \nWhat does the While House think -- if Gadhafi stays our companies can return and invest in the country ? \nThere is a freedom movement in the middle east and we are behind the curve and seem to be backing all the wrong sides . \nLets take some military action to help the freedom fighters we need to show up here -- I read some Arab group is asking for help I can not beleive we need an engraved inviation . \nIf we want to change policy in the Middle Wast and how we are looked at we need to solve our oil issues at home and encourage and get invovled in freedom movements . \nThis is our oppertunity to live up to our rhetoric of defending freedom . \nIf the United States imposes a no fly zone countless lives would be saved , yet Libya would still be in the hands of Lybian people . \nWe need to send the message that we stand by those who support freedom , not the dictators we allied with in the past like Mubarak . \nThats why we are so hated in the reigon . \nIs there any way to find out whether the rebels in Libya want our help ? \nIs there a way to find out whether the people of Egypt and the people of Algeria think we should help their neighbor Libya ? \nNever mind the rest of the Arab world . \nIf those North African nations think we should help , then we should DO IT right -- get rid of Gadhafi & his sons and get out ! \nShow those 3 nations that we merely want to stop the massacre of the Libyan people . \nLet them handle their freedom their way . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:23 pm | H. Stouffer from Charles Town , WV , we can help them by using our aircraft to intercept Libyan aircraft which are intent on killing their own people . \nIf we do not use our aircraft then we should not use any ground forces other than supplying rebel forces with anti-aircraft missles against pro-govt aircraft . \nAny U.S. aid should cease as soon as Gadhafi is eliminsated as the Libyan leader . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:23 pm | We should be ashamed of ourselves to even talk about democracy . \nThousands of Libyans and Egyptians were murdered by the dectators who were supported by the United States for the past thirty years and when people rose and ask to have democracy all we are doing is just talking about what we are going to do . \nPeople are being slutered today Mr. president not in the future . \nPerhaps a no fly zone is the least we can support . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:23 pm | Same old , same old . \nShould we sit on our hands and do nothing because we 're afraid of how it will effect our image , or do the right thing . \nIt 's a question of right and wrong , this is a no-brainer . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:23 pm | The U.S needs to be careful in libya , but it also needs to help the people of libya in their plight for freedom . \nJust because there is a no fly-zone in affect over libyan air-space does n't mean that Gadhafi 's loyalists wo n't keep on taking back opposition controlled territory on the ground . \nI think its in America 's best interest to arm and train the rebels , if Gadhafi wins America has a whole new enemy in the middle east who 's as crazy as he is brutal . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:23 pm | Im not American but I believe that America has to stand up for Libya My great great great grandfather was an American and I think if he could speak he would ask America to do what he had the to do when he followed General George Washington many yrs ago . . \nIt 's freedom so we must follow the steps that our for fathers fought and died for Because our time might come and WHO WILL FIGHT FOR US ? \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:23 pm | hey jack , come on ... help the libyan people ... ... . ! \nobama needs 2 get off his butt and do something . \nits as easy as 1 2 3 ... . . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:23 pm | The right thing to do is clear to everyone outside of the District of Columbia . \nWe are for freedom of speech everywhere . \nWe are for freedom from tyranny everywhere . \nWhy is it that our leaders ca n't answer a question our elementary students can ? \nNot every situation is about whats cheaper or politically safe . \nUnalienable rights ...

Pursuit of happiness . \nGovernments are instituted among Men , deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed ... does any of this ring a bell to anyone ? \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:23 pm | Paul Ernest Show Nashville , TN The US should not be staging any military presence in Africa , if she needs continued support fighting terrorism and other future interests . \nThe secret is that African leaders have strong disdain against Western military intervention in Africa . \nThey might appear supportive , but somewhere along the line , years to come , they will sabotage America 's interest , as punishment . \nForeign interventions remind them of colonialism and quietly unite them . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:23 pm | After fighting wars in Viet Nam , Irag , Afaganastan is n't it time we realize we should mind our business and focus on our own problems . \nWe are not the world 's police force . \nPaul , Rochester , NY March 8 , 2011 at 6:23 pm | The US should stay out of it . \nInterfering in other countries only earns us hatred . \nIt may be in American DNA to do something , but we should follow the advice of our Founding Fathers and NOT interfere in another country 's internal affairs . \nBesides , whatever the outcome in Libya , who 's to say they wo n't end up with worse than what they have now ? \nThat wo n't buy us friends if we 're involved , as we were with Saddam , Bin Laden , and the list goes on ... The US needs to utilize its own internal energy and resources , before we can reach out to others or else we will continue to damage the future of our own country . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:39 pm | What the United States should do for Libya is simple . \nWe should provide the overdue detoxification treatment for Kaddafi in our Guantanamo recreational park as soon as possible . \nAnd to keep us safe at home , we should effectively block Bin Laden s hallucinogen from seeping into our Hollywood stars drinks . \nI have seen the effect of halucinogen in one of the star 's uncontrollable ranting lately . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:39 pm | It 's way past time that we minded our own business . \nI would like to see no more aid to any country until all of our citizens who want to work have a job and medical care . \nAs I see it , that will be never . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:40 pm | The US is in a catch-22 situation and should only pursue solutions agreeable to all permanent members of the UN Security Council . \nOne thing for sure , ground troops are out of question . \nThe US might consider helping to arm the Libyan opposition only after thoroughly thinking through where some of those arms might end once Gaddafi is gone . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:40 pm | It is a serious mistake for anybody to believe that Libya could not turn into another Afghanistan\\/Vietnam . \nLibya is much closer to that than it is to Iraq . \nGiven our current situation the most we should consider taking the lead on is a no-fly-zone . \nThat is a relatively contained activity that politically would not force us to get more deeply involved . \nRealistically if a truly serious assault on our country or one of our allies were to break out we would already be hard-pressed to fight a war against them . \nMuch as the Libya situation is troubling -LRB- as are Sudan and other places -RRB- we have to start letting the UN be the world 's police force -LRB- which may involve us but does n't force us to make a permanent commitment -RRB- . \nWe have bigger problems . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:40 pm | Encourage NATO to establish a no-fly zone . \nProvide equipment and supplies to the rebels . \nDo not under any circumstances have a physical presence on the ground . \nBe prepared for a huge oil crisis . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:40 pm | Let the French and Italians deal with this . \nThey are the ones that have to worry about an extended disruption of supplies , not us . \nI do n't see them doing us any favors in Af\\/Pak . \nI do n't see them helping us with anything in fact . \nAll I see is their citizens going to college for free , getting free health care , and getting extended periods of unemployment insurance all while existing under the American Security Umbrella that we pay for and they do n't . \nMake them stand up for themselves . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:40 pm | Take the Ghadaffi 's out with a covert action , and at the same time launch air strikes to disable Gadaffi 's air force . \nIf newsmen can get to Ghadaffi why ca n't a covert action get to him . \nWe , meaning the U. S. , has supported dictators around the world and CorpRats have cuddled up to them . \nNow its time for the people to speak and take dictator Ghadaffi out . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:40 pm | I am Arab , and I have been in the US for more than 30 years , and I ve never been more proud to be an Arab than I do right now . \nALL Arab leaders are corrupt -LRB- may be not all , perhaps 99.99 % -RRB- . \nGhadhafi is not any different , he must go , and we , the US MUST help the Libyans now . \nThe Arab leaders have been covering their greed and their ill intentions under the slogan of We love Palestine . \nThese leaders have always played that Palestinian card to blind-side the Arab masses and distract them from focusing on the crimes they re committing against their own people . \nWe were able to bomb his very house before , why not now , the Arab people have always disagreed with EVERY US administrations throughout the years , I don t think this will be the one that broke the camel s back . \nUS , please help the innocent , hopeless , and hungry-for freedom Libyans March 8 , 2011 at 6:41 pm | Gadhafi 's worst fear would be for the United States to get involved . \nBut , what are we ? \nI am not sure any of us really know . \nWe might spend billions of dollars helping some other country fight for its freedom , yet people in the United states are without jobs , losing their homes with little hope of getting back all they have lost . \nI feel for the the people that want freedom , but I would like to enjoy my freedom in the United States too . \nJust what we 're doing , working with the international community . \nThis go it alone cowboy attitude of ours needs to fade into history . \nI 'm beginning to wonder with people like Gingrich wanted to go in with guns drawn , and Rep. King wanting McCarthy-like witch hunts if we , as humans , have progressed as far as we 're capable of going . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:41 pm | Simply put ... let NATO level the airports and gadhafis headquarters in Tripoli . \nThen let Arab n African countries establish the no fly zone . \nThis may be just what the `` free '' citizens of Libya need to advance to a victory . \nThis then is still there fight ... we can help just enough to level the playing field . \nThis will also send a message to other countries similar to Gadhafi that attacks on civilians will not go without consequences . \nIt will also make it clear that other options will be considered and utilized besides embargo 's and financial restraints . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:41 pm | What do you think would happen if a large group of people wanted the us government out of power and they took over a army base and handed out guns and bombs and said lets take over the government ? \nDo you the there would be a clash with the military of the govrenment and do n't you think people would die at the hands of the president in charge to save his power , and would that president than be charged for killing his own people HHMMMMMM i wonder ?

\nThis is not about Libya , is about the middle east . \nSo the US should leaver them . \nThe absolute worst thing for the US to do is to give the rebels weapons . \nThis scenario has happened in the past , and history repeats itself . \nIf we give them powerful weapons , and when the rebel government deicides , once they overthrow Qaddafi , that they are dead set against destroying the West , and we attempt to intervene , they will be fighting us with our own weapons -LRB- like Afghanistan -RRB- . \nThe best solution is to sanction a no-flly zone over Libya and shoot down all of their planes with our weapons in our hands . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:46 pm | We need to stay out , because if we ca n't afford it . \nIts time that we gave humanitarian aid to the American people . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:48 pm | United States should wait until ordered by the UN to act . \nPeople must remember that USA are not the police of this world . \nThats why United Nations was created . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:48 pm | The right thing to do is to hold people accountable for war crimes . \nObviously , we should hold our own war criminals accountable before we go looking outside our borders for others to hold accountable . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:48 pm | March 8 , 2011 at 6:48 pm | We are not the world 's policeman . \nLook at the trouble we are in now because we think we are enough is enough . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:49 pm | Jack , as a Canadian , I 'm just as thrilled about Canadians potentially being in a second war -LRB- and as we are part of NATO , we would be -RRB- , as you are being in your third . \nBut as much as we should worry about the probable blowback to bombing Libya , we have to be sure that having Gaddafi win this would be much , much worse , and not just for the Libyans that have defied him . \nIn the end , I don t see an alternative but for Obama to eventually come full circle , get in front of the camera , and demand that an Arab dictator and his sons leave . \nWithout doubt the United States is the gorilla on the world stage and it is in our DNA to help other countries realize the human rights benefits we enjoy . \nBut with that said we do not have a clear right to put our young people at risk to resolve civil unrest around the world . \nI believe we should have a clear policy in place under which we would help a country resolve it 's conflicts . \nThese policy issues should include , at the very least , : 1 -RRB- Both sides should ask the US to intervene , 2 -RRB- Hostilities must cease immediately , 3 -RRB- US involvement will only involve peacekeeping and humanitarian aid . \n4 -RRB- Resolution of the conflict will focus on the establishment of a government that includes the basic needs of both sides . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:49 pm | Jack forgive me for being politically incorrect , but we dont need to be involved in another war . \nWe have enough involvement in the mid east to keep us busy for now . \nWho knows who is in line to take the helm there . \nMarch 8 , 2011 at 6:51 pm | It does n't matter what we do in that part of the world because we are always damned if we do and damned if we do n't by the people in that part of the world . \nIf we help them , anything and everything that goes wrong will be our fault . \nIf we do not help them , anything and everything that goes wrong will be our fault . \nAm I the only person who has noticed this fact ?

'' \nHe praised the Libyan standard of living as one that others in the world envy and called on his countrymen to defend it . \n`` They want to take your petrol , '' he said . \n`` This is what America , this is what the French , those colonialists , want . '' \nHe cited people from Pakistan , Afghanistan and Algeria as among those who have joined the rebel forces -- `` hunting children who are not mature , who have certain deficiencies ; they offer them pills . \nThis is what we understood so far .

'' \nLong lines of parked cars snake through the city next to gas stations , where drivers sometimes wait days to buy gas . \nHuge piles of garbage have started to accumulate on streets , parks and beaches due to the departure of armies of guest workers who often fulfilled basic municipal duties . \nA gleaming , recently constructed Marriott hotel stands empty on one of Tripoli 's sea fronts , a symbol of the burst of foreign investment that was frozen after the conflict erupted last February . \nThe NATO-enforced blockade of seaports and airports controlled by Gadhafi 's forces have severely disrupted trade , forcing Tripoli to rely largely on food and fuel trucked in from neighboring Tunisia . \nEarlier in July , the United Nations published a report warning about `` pockets of vulnerability '' in Tripoli and other Gadhafi-controlled cities . \nA U.N. humanitarian team reported seeing shortages of cash , medicine , and fuel . \nThe besieged Gadhafi regime has acknowledged the growing hardship . \nIn an interview several weeks ago with CNN , the finance and planning minister in Tripoli announced his government had begun pumping in `` large amounts of funds '' to drive down growing war-time prices of basic consumer goods like rice , flour , meat , eggs , sugar and edible oils . \nThese measures appear to have helped Libyans preparing for a month of fast-breaking iftar feasts . \n`` Everything we need is available . \nThere has been a slight increase in prices , very small increase , '' said an elderly retired engineer named Milad Omar . \nHarder to evaluate is the impact the conflict is having on the collective Libyan psyche . \nRegime officials strictly control the movements and conversations of foreign journalists . \nAnd after 42 years of strict Gadhafi rule , Libyans often appear visibly uncomfortable speaking openly about their situation . \nBut on a recent visit to the market in Tripoli 's central Abu Salim neighborhood , CNN journalists met two families who said they had recently fled fighting in the nearby Nafusa mountains to the southwest of the capital . \n`` We woke up to shelling , '' said Mabouka Hassem . \nHer town of Al Josh came under attack from rebel fighters on Thursday morning , she said . \n`` We never expected it . \nOur neighbors who live in the hills above us attacked us . '' \nHassem said she and her sister and their children fled crying and screaming , some barefoot . \nThey arrived in Tripoli on Friday . \n`` We left with only the clothes on our back , '' said Nuri Mohamed Ali , a man who said he fled with his children from Gawalish , another front-line town , two weeks ago . \nHe walked through the market with two of his children , shopping ahead of what is supposed to be a month focused on faith , spirituality and reflection . \nOfficials in Tripoli have been preparing for what they say will be a bloody Ramadan . \nAt a recent gathering in support of Gadhafi , a Muslim cleric told CNN that loyalist troops would be authorized to break their daytime fasts to fight on the front lines . \n`` Those who are fasting , if they get thirsty they should break their fast . \n-LRB- Because -RRB- those who are fighting are Mujahedeen -LRB- holy warriors -RRB- , '' said Mohammed Madani Chouairef . \n`` Everyone standing up to this sedition is a Mujahed except for those who are with NATO .

'' \nHere s my question to you : Should the U.S. do something to protect Libyans from Gadhafi ? \nInterested to know which ones made it on air ? \nNo , they seem to be doing quite well on their own . \nIf the leaders of the opposition ask publicly for our help we would then be justified in doing so , otherwise it would be construed as the Americans attacking another Muslim country . \nEnforcing a no-fly zone would be a good first step , arming the rebels an excellent second , and hanging the consequences a necessary third . \nInnocent people are being slaughtered while wise men ponder . \nIf acting now is not who we are , then who are we ? \nUnfortunately , countries like France , China and Russia do not come forward during such times to take steps to protect innocent people from being killed by their own people . \nYet , they will hide behind the U.S. and criticize us for whatever actions we take . \nThe UN really does not have much credibility and effectiveness . \nWe need to do the right thing rather than standby and watch the slaughter of innocent people . \nHumanitarian aide , yes . \nDiplomatic pressure , of course , But no acts of war . \nWe have plenty on our plate right now . \nLet the British do it . \nGadhafi 's their buddy . \nDid n't the British let out that `` dying '' terrorist , who flew off to a hero 's welcome in Libya ? \nDoes n't the British government get most of their oil from there ? \nSo let them deal with him . \nJack , the United States should stay out of this , condemn the violence , and let the UN send food and medical aid . \nIf the Libyans want freedom , they will need to shed their own blood to achieve it . \nThe U.S. government has enough to do protecting us from ourselves , which includes not getting into all the world 's conflicts . \nFor the first time since Paul Wolfowitz first opened his mouth in public I find myself agreeing We should recognize the temporary Government and ask them what help they need but agreeing with a person that signed the PNAC agreement one has to wonder why he might speak with such logic . \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 5:58 pm | I may go as far as putting In a No fly-Zone In so the Libyan people would n't have too worry about being attack from the sky . \nBut no more than that . \nUnless Ask by the Libyan people Provisional Government and ask to do so on TV so the rest of the middle east can hear It . \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 5:58 pm | The US has sponsored this dictator . \nWe are the reason he has held onto power for so long , and why he is incredibly wealthy while his people just get by . \nThe protest signs read `` go out US '' . \nThe world should stand by and not become involved beyond humanitarian purposes . \nThe Libyans need to be allowed to form a government representative of them , and them solely . \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 5:58 pm | Jack , I think they 've got it under control . \nThe US should provide humanitarian aid , food , medicine , and shelter in the interest of fostering peace and cooperation in the region . \nAny military action on our part will be viewed as usurping the right of Libyans to total self-determination . \nAlthough on the other hand , we could n't have done it 200 years ago without the French . \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 5:58 pm | I 'm getting tired of the ripping of Obama for not being ` tough ' enough on Llibya . \nWhat is he supposed to be doing that he is n't already ? \nhave n't we learned the painful lesson that there is a limit to our ability to impose our power without drastically negative consequences for all involved ? \n-LRB- see iraw -RRB- . \nWe must get off this quick draw , send in the marines mentality . \nTthe Libyan people do n't want it and Americans certainly do n't want it . \nIt is an international crises that needs ot be handled by the international community , of which , finally , we are trying to be a part instead of being the lonesome cowboy . \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 5:59 pm | Do you have any earthly idea how much the U.S. Marines aboard the 6th Fleet want to do this thing ? \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 5:59 pm | Yes , but only with the same number of troops went onshore with on D-Day in France ... if not then stay out of it and let the Libyans settle it among themselves . \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 5:59 pm | I support the Libyans in their fight for freedom but we can not protect or defend the entire world . \nOur ATTEMPT to do this has resulted in a military budget that is greater than all the others in the world combined and debt we can no longer ignore Others in the world need to step up and help ... Let the Australians or Germans or Japanese -- they dont spend what we do or have the debt we do , maybe they can afford it . \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 5:59 pm | We 'll be damned either way . \nWhere is the new world leader ... China ? \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 6:00 pm | No more wars except to defend our shores . \nWe are overextended militarily . \nWe are already upside down in debt . \nThe American people have sacrificed far too much for international corporations , big banks and the oil companies . \nBut , arming the oil executives and dropping them off on the beaches of Libya would be O.k. with me as long as they pay for their weapons . \nAlso , no air or naval support . \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 6:00 pm | People fighting and dying for democracy and freedom ... DUH ! \n200 + years ago did France not come to our aid and help us build America ! \nWe have no greater duty in our role as the world leader than to support Libyans , albeit in concert with the U.N. and NATO . \nNO !!! We need to take care of ourselves for a change . \nWho cares what other nations think of us . \nThis is none of our business and we need to keep our noses out of it . \nWe are in debt . \n2 ENDLESS wars still going on . . \nNobody elected us the worlds savior ... And who would pay to save them ? \nWe would just borrow the money from China again ... March 1 , 2011 at 6:00 pm | This is a no-win situation for Obama and for America . \nIf he uses military force and Libyans die , America will be blamed for intervening in another country 's sovereign affairs . \nIf he lets Libyans sort this out for themselves and Libyans get annihilated , he will be accused of standing by while another Rwanda occurred . \nA good option might be for Obama to assemble some sort of UN-backed coalition to establish no-fly zones backed up with military force . \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 6:00 pm | The U.S. should not meddle in the affairs of other countries . \nThis is a civil war , and we have no reason to interfere . \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 6:01 pm | Yeah , we could `` protect '' them right out of their oil like we protect other Mideast countries . \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 6:01 pm | Jack it looks like a lot of Libyans are doing a pretty good job on their own without our assistance . \nShould we send in troops that will open us up to a mess like Iraq ... no. . \nWe bombed Iraq back to the stone age . \nGuess who will be stuck with the bill for rebuilding . \nI can see helping people and providing food , medicine , but sending in troops ... no way . \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 6:02 pm | No. . \nWe 've lost too many boys\\/men for the sake of some other country 's ` liberty ' . \nIn the meantime , the American people lose more and more liberties to protect these countries . \nI 'm tired of them hating on us . \nAfter all , most of the world views us as the Ugly Americans . \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 6:03 pm | The U.S. by itself should never feel free to act militarily . \nIf the U.N agrees , after all other measures failed , then a multi-national force should act , but only as a `` Peace keeper '' ... As leaders of the free world we do n't want to get rid of a dictatorship with another type of forced government brought by us ! \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 6:03 pm | Perhaps the presence of the Enterprise , -LRB- same ship from the Gulf of Sidra Incident -RRB- and her escorts enforcing a no fly zone would send a much stronger and forceful message to Ghaddaffi Duck . \nSince the British RAF and the German Luftwaffe are already engaged in operations to rescue their people from Libya , then why not ? \nThe Libyan military is hardly a threat to most nations nowdays , they ca n't even defend themselves from themselves with equipment left over from the 1980s ... In fact , mybe Malta might mount a military operation of its own and probably suceed in ousting Mo. . \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 6:03 pm | Absolutely not . \nWe should focus all our efforts in the U.S. economy . \nNothing else comes close in terms of importance , especially Libya . \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 6:03 pm | Historically though one thing than can unite a regime collasping from internal revolt is an invasion by another nation -LRB- Iran during the Iran-Iraq war for a quick example -RRB- . \nGadaffi is rambling like a madman about Americans blah blah and the last thing we 'd want is to give him the distraction he needs . \nThe country will fall on its own ; all we need to and should do is support the new government afterward . \nHowever supplying and supporting rebels in the nation should be considered , and offering asylum to those requesting it should be done . \nWe can not let Gadhafi butcher his people , but we can not afford any sort of occupation whatsoever , so we need to support Libyan protesters without an actual invasion . \nThe United States must protect those Libyans who otherwise would be slaughtered by Gadhafi . \nWe sit on the sideline too long and many die unnecessarily . \nLet 's make a decision , Washington , D.C. Administration ... the time is at hand ! \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 6:03 pm | US is to lead consensus with other nations , not to act alone . \nFreezing assets , no fly zone , support the cities that have already been freed . \nstop arm sells to Libya 's goverment . \nNo american ground troops should be send unless the UN approves that . \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 6:03 pm | Jack-we are not the world police and i do n't see anyone offering to help us with our messes . \nLet these nations pay for our help . \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 6:04 pm | A tough question . \nIf we indeed stand for people s freedom to demonstrate and petition their governments for change and are willing to act with something like a no-fly zone -LRB- an entirely justifiable action -RRB- , where do we draw the line ? \nA small time dictator like Gadhafi offers up an easy response . \nHowever , does anyone think that the Saudi government would do anything different than Gadhafi should its people protest the utter oppression there ? \nWould we enforce a no fly zone in SA if the royals started bombing their own people ? \nConsidering they are our dealers for our gross addiction to the almighty barrel , my guess is no. . \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 6:04 pm | I can still see the people there cheering and having a good time when the PanAm 903 bomber was returned to Libya , no let them fight it out and then make sure that no other arab country goes in and tries to take over . \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 6:05 pm | The world should provide humanitarian assistance however should allow Libya & its citizens to fight `` their '' civial war . \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 6:06 pm | We have to deal with realities . \nWe are still stuck in Bush 's quagmire of Iraq plus we are still are trying to finish what Bush did not finish in Afghanistan . \nThis does n't even begin to cover the financial disaster Bush and Republicans caused . \nHow can we step in ? \nWe can only step in so much into the world 's problems . \nWe are not the world 's police or the world 's guard dogs . \nI hate to see people mercilessly slaughtered . \nbut we have to take care of our out citizens first . \nOther countries have militarily also . \nWhy does n't China . \nGermany or France step in for once ? \nThey want to be power houses well with the good comes the bad let them help clean up some of the messes . \nThis is part o why the deficit is so high we are always playing world police . \nWe should only step into Libya if Oil prices get too high and it will damage our economy worse . \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 6:06 pm | I think giving more arms and ammunition to Libyans -LRB- as Great Britain is doing -RRB- and humanitarian aide -LRB- as France is doing -RRB- are good concrete aids we should DO . \nThe words are important about our outrage ; but Libyan who are more than willing to ` do this for themselves ' would appreciate actual aide . \nI do n't know why we seem frozen in place ? \nWe have watched the slaughter of thousands in Darfur , is it they have no oil ? \nLet me be clear , we do n't care if there is nothing to gain . \nMy question is do we crank up the war machine ? \nWe are presently only involved in two wars . \nDo we need a third ? \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 6:08 pm | March 1 , 2011 at 6:09 pm | If we can get in and get out quickly , white taking out Gadhafi , then yes , but only if our presence is wanted by the Libyan people . \nHow to gage that I 'm not too sure . \nWe went into Afghanistan and Iraq ... how does our government pick and choose ? \nI do n't know . \nI do think it is encouraging that these people want their freedom and want to be a part of the free world . \nLess places for terrorists to plan and train is a good thing . \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 6:09 pm | The better question is whether we should follow the path of the Libyan people and do something to protect America from the gang of cutthroats that has overthrown our government . \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 6:09 pm | Nothing ! \nleave them alone !!! and leave the entire arab nations alone !!!! March 1 , 2011 at 6:10 pm | The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq cost 1 billion dollars a day . \nIf these wars were ended , US would see large reduction in spending . \nThese wars contributed to most of the debt . \nThese wars are not being fought to protect Americans . \nThey are being fought for oil and Iridium . \nUS is in these countries until `` favorable '' governments are set up in them . \nSo oil companies and mining companies can set up there . \nAfter all , they do not want a repeat of Chevron and Venezuela . \nThese wars are immoral . \nAmerican service men and women are being killed and maimed as are the civilians caught in the crossfire . \nMeanwhile , programs to help the poor and middle class in this country are being cut . \nSo the rich can get richer . \nThe wars need to be stopped . \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 6:10 pm | Yes , but make it quick !! Maybe a few cruise missiles in Tripoli . \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 6:11 pm | In retrospect , one could argue that whatever the reasons for us going into Iraq were publicly -- privately we as Americans were hoping to ` push ' stable , peaceful democracy in the Middle-East . \nIn Libya , we see a natural ` pulling ' toward such a paradigm shift . \nIf we are willing to run up our debt and ask soldiers to fight and die to PUSH such an agenda -- we damn well better be ready to support the people on the other end who would help us PULL it in Libya . \nI think we should enforce a no fly zone at a minimum ; keep in mind that military action like that would only occur in a fantasy world where our conntry did n't waste money & time in countries that did n't pose a threat to our security like Iraq . \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 6:11 pm | How about protecting the iranians from Najad , how a bout protecting Tunisian , Yemenies and so on why the focus on Libya because of the oil again we shouldnt intefer in any countrys business we dont need new wars , , we didn finsh the wars we started 10 yrs ago . \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 6:11 pm | The U.S. does NOT need to protect Libya or it 's people . \nWe have enough problems in this country to deal with such as The Economy , Welfare , Homeless and Starving people of our own . \nWe seem to rush to the aid of other countries but do nothing to help our own people . \nWhat is our country thinking . \nLet them fight their own battles . \nWe need to step it up here and get help for the United States . \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 6:12 pm | We lost all our credibility for humanitarianism when we invaded Iraq . \nWith our record of torture , renditioning , inhumane treatments of detainees and other atrocities , perhaps aiding the Libyans for purely unselfish and humanitarian reasons might restore our standing in the world . \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 6:12 pm | Although I would like to help out the Libians the reality is we are already fighting a two front war and can not risk opening a 3rd front . \nThis country is not an endless supplier of military power and money . \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 6:13 pm | No ! \nThe Libyans did n't lift so much as a finger to save us from Bush , Cheney , and Rumsfeld , so why should we save them from Qaddaffi ? \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 6:13 pm | No , not unless asked to do so and then sparingly if that . \nThey have told the rest of the world they want to handle this on their own and I think we should respect that . \nWe have already bankrupted ourselves with Iraq , it 's not fair to the taxpayer to get involved in another war . \nWho do we think we are to position ourselves as the world 's parent ? \nI find this sort of arrogance both sickening and embarassing . \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 6:13 pm | The United States simply does n't have the resources to assist every nation that is encountering sociopolitical difficulties . \nIt is n't fiscally responsible for us to get involved , when we have many people in our own country without decent food , healthcare , or shelter . \nI am glad that we are a nation that helps people out that are in need , but when will be the `` right '' time to help ourselves ? \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 6:13 pm | At this point I care less about what we do than how we are going to pay for it . \nIf we are going to take military action , let 's pass a tax in advance . \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 6:13 pm | Right now , tue United Sports needs to sit tight and stop worrying about any other country but ITSELF ! \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 6:13 pm | I would n't waste ONE OUNCE , of American Blood , for ANY of them ! \nI wish we could line ALL the Arabs up on ONE side and All the Jews up , on the OTHER side , give EACH side some short-range nuclear weapons and count to three ! \nThose two have been hating and killing each other , over that barren strip of land , since the BEGINNING OF TIME ! \nAnd they will be fighting and killing each other , when we 're all dead and gone ! \nThere will NEVER be peace in The Middle East ! \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 6:17 pm | The initial knee jerk answer to your question is CERTAINLY . \nHowever , we have US Citizens dying in the streets , some continuing to lose jobs , schools in danger of having no teachers and two political parties that can do NOTHING for any of the above mentioned citizens save throwing stones at each other . \nIf we do anything for Libya , it will have to be in concert with the rest of the free nations of the world . \nWe can not afford to pay for the freedom of everyone in the world when our own citizens ca n't see the light at the end of the tunnel . \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 6:17 pm | NO , NO , NO. not unless libya pay us twice the value of what we spend on them in oil . \n-LRB- for every dollar we spend on them they pay us two dollars in oil -RRB- if we are going to be the world police we need to be paid first , fight later ... March 1 , 2011 at 6:17 pm | No , the United States should not get involved in the political unrest in the Middle East . \nWe can not afford the wars we are in now . \nWe need to protect our own borders and the people in this country . \nNone of these countries want us there and never appreciate the extreme cost our beautiful country takes on to help the world . \nThe people of these countries will never change their way of treating each other and us . \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 6:18 pm | No. . . \nwith our current involvement in 2 other countries -LRB- Afganistan & Iraq -RRB- and our economic plight here at home , we can not be the global savior . \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 6:18 pm | Stay out of it ! \nWe do n't have any money so why should we be posing as the worlds Big Brother . \nSpend our money here . \nLeave the Middle East and Libya to the Middle Easterners and Europe and Isreal . \nConcentrate on competeing with China ! \nCreate Jobs here shrink the Military . \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 6:18 pm | john j. grimes watertown , ma . \nThe United States should cease it 's meddling in the Middle East when we ca n't even take care of our own problems . \nThe last time we instituted a no-fly zone was in Iraq which resulted in the shooting down of a civilian airliner and the deaths of over 200 innocent civilians . \nI voted for Obama because he said he would get us out of Iraq & Afghanistan which he has not done . \nNow he wants to start up another incident with Libya . \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 6:18 pm | No the people stated they do n't want us and they know best . \nWe should respect their wishes . \nThey have been told for too long whats good for them . \nLets respect them March 1 , 2011 at 6:18 pm | Unfortunately countries like France , China and Russia do not come forward during such times to take steps to protect innocent people from being killed by their own people . \nYet , they will hide behind the US and criticize us for whatever actions we take . \nThe UN really does not have much credibility and effectiveness . \nWe need to do the right thing rather than standby and watch the slaughter of innocent people . \nwe also need to stop supporting all of these dictatorial regimes around the world on one hand and preaching democracy on the other . \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 6:18 pm | Not yet . \nThe rebels seem to be holding on and gaining so allow them to handle their own affairs for the time being . \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 6:18 pm | I have 2 sons , 2 grandsons , and a granddaughter in service to our country . \nThey , along with other courageous soldiers , have answered the call to protect us and our freedoms . \nI do n't want to see any other brave Americans die in the middle of another country 's civil war . \nHave we not done enough ? \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 6:18 pm | Jack most Americans do not even know where Libya is on a map if you were to show it to them and i doubt most Libyans know where America is on a map either . \nAmerica is not the keeper of the world . \nWe are one country among many and we are now a poor country that is ass deep in debt to other countries . \nNo jack we do n't need to help Libya . \nTheir neighbors need to help them as they stand to gain or lose the most out of what Libya becomes . \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 6:18 pm | We want do squat til it 's to late . \nSticks & stones will break their bones but words ' well you get the drift . \nWe have successfully made ourselves irrelevant and have CHANGE YOU CAN TO BELIEVE IN TO BLAME . \nThe Eagle is grounded . \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 6:18 pm | Yes , Jack , just what the secretary of defense has announced that we would do . \nI 'm sich and tired of all these hawks who ca n't wait to get more of oour kids killed while other countries of the world sit and let us do all the dirty work . \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | We should provide humanitarian aid only , unless we 're asked to intervene . \nWe have n't had much success in intervening in disputes since WW11 . \nThe Libyan people do n't seem to want foreign intervention . \nMany on twitter ask US NOT to step in . \nAlso there are pictures of banners in Libya saying `` No Foreign Intervention '' . \nBut there are thousands on the borders with Egypt and Tunisia . . \nWe should help the refugees or the chaos might endanger 3 revolutions -- Egypt , Tunisia and Libya March 1 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | Yes . \nWe 've forced our way into enough countries for political and economic reasons , all too often with barely any hesitation . \nHow about doing it for the right reason for a change . \nNo occupation , just get in , help the Libyans , and get out . \nIt would certainly help me feel a little less embarrassment about the obviously unjust wars the last administration got us into . \nLet 's put our morals where our mouth is for a change . \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | From the halls of Montezuma to the shores of ... send our boys in , it 's way past time . \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | Obama is being very careful , rightfully so . \nIf we take military action against Gadhafi , do we do the same for the Iranian protestors ?

\nLet the Lybians fight for their own independence . \nEven if we help them , they 're not going to like us anyway . \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | absolutely not . \nThat is a revolution in their own country . \nIf Libians in the USA are worried about their families , they will have to go on there own and fight and help . \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | No , definitely no. . \nWe can t save the whole world , we can not afford to do this even though it might be the right thing to do . \nIf we do , it wo n't surprise me if everyone who said we should will complain that we did . \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | Jack I have always admired you and your comments . \nUSA administration should do no more than it is doing at this time simply because this is the better way for everyone involved . \nKeep in mind it is better to be respected and loved than to be feared because the previous administrations have always somehow stood by these dictators we are now trying to get rid of which makes the present administration 's cautious action the only action to take now . \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | yes , The US should help libyans because people are being killed for no reason , that is a enough reason to help them . \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | Leave Lybia alone . \nIt 's not our country , it 's not our issue and yes , I know all about their oil . \nHaving been born in Alaska -LRB- pre Palin era -RRB- and having spent the better part of my life around the oil industry I know that Alaska and the Continental United States have MORE THAN ENOUGH OIL reserves to last an extremely long time -- the oil industry just does n't want you to know that . \nSo , we actually have no real interest in Lybia , let it go . \nGet back to the business of figuring out how to take care of America and her citizens . \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | America should not get involved in Libya . \nIf there is a humanitarian or even a military necessity for intervention there is the Arab league and others in the hemisphere with a vested interest that should be allowed to respond . \nour sending 3 warships to the coast implies that we will , by force , impress upon Libya what the world thinks we are intending to impress upon any nation we feel that it is in our interest to do so . \nSo , after we eliminate another dictator that we either implanted , supported or allowed to exist unbridled , then we 'll impose our will to usher in someone we feel WE are comfortable with . \nA military option is no option but , the military industrial complex and others with dollars signs in their eyes will impose their will and our sons and daughters will be in another far off place fighting for a reason they know not what other than it 's their duty ! \nWe need to get our own house in order and not be the world 's dictator ! \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | I 've been saying for over a year and I still say ...

\nDid we learn anything from supporting dictatorships in the interest of oil ? \nIts clear -- we do n't get involved . \nWe do n't lose a single friend or family member in Libya . \nI have a new found respect for the people in the Middle East right now . \nThey are showing the world they do n't support such tyranny and oppression . \nLet them win their freedom and stamp out those who betrayed them and their country . \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 6:21 pm | Yes , I believe US is already doing a lot to protect the Libyan citizens , short of a direct military intervention . \nKeep in mind , Libya is still a sovereign nation and their current crisis is an internal affair , with an anti Gadhafi opposition rising against the 41 years of dictatorship . \nAlthough a US military action might sound simple and tangible in the name of protecting human lives and rights , we have to consider the fact that our entrance into an internal turmoil would not be seen kindly by other Arab nations . \nI do believe only a unilateral agreement by UN would allow a coalition of military forces to protect Libyan citizens and oust Gadhafi , if he decides to commit a mass genocide upon his population . \nNo , because this is n't as simple as people fighting for freedom . \nThis involves tribal grudges going back 1000 years . \nThe only solution the Libyans will be happy with is one they come up with on their own . \nAt a minimum , before a single U.S. military asset is committed to `` fight for Freedom in Libya '' , the president and his advisors should take a class on North African tribes and their history . \nRemember when we invaded Iraq completely ignorant of the difference between Shiite and Sunni ? \nSuch folly should not be repeated . \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 6:21 pm | We are a global society now . \nYes , of course the US should help , as all able countries should . \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 6:21 pm | Hi Jack , your question is one that started to get to me big time today . \nYes , the U.S. should get involved in helping the Libyans against Ghadafi . \nOur forces are already strained in Afghanistan but Canada always played a huge role in UN Humanitarian and Peacekeeping efforts in the past . \nHelping Libyans will also help the Egyptians and Tunisians who are already strapped and under new and tentative regimes . \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 6:21 pm | No , it should be very limited in what we do in Libia . \nWhy oh why do we have to get our nose in every damm thing that goes on in the world . \nWe are way upside down in debt , got two wars , got military in almost every country in the world . \nThe europeans should be doing most if anything that needs to be done . \nVerbal support , thats it . \nMarch 1 , 2011 at 6:22 pm | Protect Libyans from Gadhafi ?

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon The European Union has imposed new sanctions against the Libyan regime Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The United States has frozen at least $ 30 billion in Libyan government assets , a U.S. Treasury official announced Monday -- one of a series of steps being taken by international leaders designed to break strongman Moammar Gadhafi 's grip on power . \nThe $ 30 billion is the largest amount ever blocked under any sanctions program , according to David Cohen , the acting Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence . \nAmerican officials slapped the sanctions on Libya last Friday , and the U.N. Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution on Libya on Saturday . \nPresident Barack Obama met Monday with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to discuss a variety of measures under consideration . \nBan later told reporters that `` further action may well be necessary . '' \nUN imposes sanctions on Libya For rebels , a long road to Tripoli Gadhafi `` has lost his legitimacy when he declared war on his people , '' Ban said of the Libyan leader . \n`` This is again a totally unacceptable situation . \nI sincerely hope and urge him to listen to the peoples ' call . \nThat 's my message to him . '' \nAll options are still on the table , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said at a meeting of the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva , Switzerland . \n`` Gadhafi and those around him must be held accountable -LRB- for any actions -RRB- which violate international legal obligations and common decency , '' she said . \n`` Through their actions , they have lost the legitimacy to govern . '' \nSusan Rice , U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , called Gadhafi `` delusional , '' adding that `` when he -LRB- Gadhafi -RRB- can laugh when talking to American and international journalists while he is slaughtering his own people , it only underscores how unfit he is to lead and how disconnected he is from reality . '' \nThe imposition of a no-fly zone over certain portions of the increasingly chaotic country is among the courses of action being contemplated , White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters . \nCarney indicated that exile is `` certainly one option '' for the Libyan leader . \nHe also said that American officials are `` actively reaching out '' to Libyan opponents of the ruling regime , Carney said . \nBut any speculation on U.S. assistance to the Libyan rebels is premature , Rice said , calling it `` unclear at this point who will emerge as the critical opposition element . \nWe await to see how the opposition will coalesce . '' \nPentagon spokesman Col. David Lapan said the U.S. military is moving Navy ships closer to Libya . \nTwo U.S. Navy warships -- the carrier USS Enterprise and the amphibious assault ship USS Kearsarge -- are currently in the Red Sea and available to assist , U.S. military officials told CNN . \nLapan refused to indicate whether any American ground forces have been put on a heightened state of alert . \nBritish PrimeMinister David Cameron echoed Washington 's call for Gadhafi to step aside . \n`` We are taking every step possible to isolate the Gadhafi regime , deprive it of money , shrink its power and ensure that anyone responsible for abuses in Libya will be held to account , '' Cameron told members of Britain 's parliament Monday . \nIn Brussels , the European Union banned the sale of arms and ammunition to Libya . \nIt also prohibited any trade with Gadhafi 's government that could lead to the acquisition of equipment that could be used for the repression of Libyans . \nThe EU also froze the assets of Gadhafi and five members of his family , while imposing a visa ban on Gadhafi and 15 other people tied to the regime 's crackdown . \n`` The massive violence against peaceful demonstrators shocks our conscience , '' EU High Representative Catherine Ashton said . \n`` It should also spring us into action . '' \nOver the weekend , Italy suspended a treaty with Libya that includes a non-aggression pact , helping to pave the way for possible military action by U.S. or NATO troops . \nItaly is home to the U.S. Navy 's Sixth Fleet . \nKurt Volker , a former U.S. ambassador to NATO , told CNN that Italy 's suspension of the pact would not immediately suffice for military actions to be launched from that country . \nThe question , from the perspective of the Italian government , is `` if you 're really trying to think about military action , do you have some kind of authorization to do so ? '' \nhe said in an interview . \n`` You would need a U.N. mandate and possibly a NATO declaration or both , and there is n't anything like that on the table at the moment . '' \nBut , Volker said , others in the international community may soon have to decide whether to intervene militarily . \n`` At some point we have to face the question of are we willing to help them or not , '' he said . \nThe situation in Libya differs from that of Egypt , where the United States was trying to balance various interests , Volker noted . \n`` We have no countervailing interests -LRB- here -RRB- . \n... -LRB- Gadhafi -RRB- has been a terrible dictator . \nHe was a terror plotter . \nHe blew up the plane in Lockerbie . \nSo we have no reason not to be helping the people of Libya get rid of this tyrant . '' \nDespite the growing international pressure , Gadhafi stood his ground Monday . \nProtesters fearful of violence stayed off the streets in Tripoli . \nGovernment officials warned that thousands of people could die if the popular uprising continues . \nThe death toll from the unrest -- now in its 14th day -- has already topped 1,000 , according to a U.N. estimate . \nClinton noted Monday that U.S. humanitarian teams have been dispatched to Libya 's borders at Tunisia and Egypt . \nWashington has set aside an additional $ 10 million for humanitarian aid , including medical supplies , she noted . \nCNN 's Tom Watkins , Lesa Jansen , Kelly Marshall Smoot and Larry Shaughnessy contributed to this report \n"}

'' \nPakistanis protest U.S. drone action Bittersweet victory for Misrata rebels Fighting still raging in Misrata Drones are likely to be just as ineffective in Libya . \nThe official U.S. aim there is civilian protection . \nU.N. Security Council Resolution 1973 of March 17 says the use of `` all necessary measures '' is authorized `` to protect civilians and civilian populated areas under threat of attack in '' Libya . \nThe resolution responded to the imminent rout of Libyan rebels from Benghazi , and the fear that Libyan armed forces would exact revenge on civilians left behind . \nThe resolution did not authorize outside intervention in a civil war . \nIndeed , an earlier resolution , Resolution 1970 , imposes a weapons embargo on all of Libya . \nResolution 1973 continues that embargo with an exception to establish a `` no-fly '' zone and take other steps to protect civilians . \nAfter defending Benghazi , the U.S. should have turned immediately to seeking a peaceful end of the crisis . \nThe U.S. rejected out of hand the African Union peace initiative , thereby putting no pressure on the rebels to come to the table . \nObama , French President Nicolas Sarkozy and British Prime Minister David Cameron instead took the new position that Moammar Gadhafi must go as a condition of ending the use of force . \nIn this case , such a position is unlikely to help the cause of peace -- it only backs Gadhafi further into a corner . \nEach day the war continues , civilians are killed or die as a result of the fighting . \nJust as the fighting seemed to settle into a stalemate that could only be broken by negotiations at last -- the drones arrive . \nTheir deployment appears set to move the conflict even further from a peaceful settlement . \nEven if the unlikely occurs and Gadhafi and his sons leave or are killed , continued fighting or chaos are predictable . \nPerhaps the U.S. aim is not primarily civilian protection but regime change ? \nIf so , drone attacks will be no more helpful to that aim than to civilian protection . \nAir attacks can keep the rebels in the fight but can not win the war for them . \nA civil war can only be won by control of territory , not control of the air . \nControlling territory requires military and civilian leadership , organization , training and equipment to defeat the Libyan army and replace the government . \nThe rebels have deficits in all of these categories . \nEven if air attacks could buy NATO time to try to organize and train the rebels , Resolution 1970 does not permit arming the rebels . \nSending drones to Libya is unlikely to bring the rebels a military victory . \nDrones are likely to prolong the fighting and the deaths of civilians . \nSending drones does not even help Obama keep his promise that NATO would take the lead . \nDrones controlled by the U.S. deploy major military force . \nDrones give the appearance of a sophisticated , high-tech policy , not involving a big U.S. military presence . \nWhat they really give us is death and destruction that will not lead to the end of terrorism in Pakistan -- or peace in Libya . \nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mary Ellen O'Connell . \n"}

'' \nFighting also raged in the town of Bin Jawad , where the sounds of booms -- either aerial bombardments or heavy artillery -- could be heard echoing . \nThe opposition also worked to keep control of Ras Lanuf . \nThousands trying to leave Libya Opposition at work in Benghazi The young and inexperienced go to war The battles came in stark contrast to the image Gadhafi 's regime sought to portray in the capital , Tripoli . \nThrongs filled Green Square , cheering their support of Gadhafi , with some insisting they were celebrating the government 's victory in Misrata . \nA government official said Gadhafi 's regime was victorious in Ras Lanuf and in Zawiya , as well . \nCNN was not allowed to enter Zawiya on Sunday , and could not reach people inside the city . \nReports said communications had been cut off . \nLibyan state TV also claimed that the government had gained control of the eastern port city of Tobruk . \n`` Morning victory , oh people of Libya . \nVictory city of Tobruk from terrorist gangs , '' the station said . \nWitnesses in Tobruk , though , said it was still under opposition control . \nU.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon talked Sunday morning with Libyan Foreign Minister Musa Kasa , appealing for an end to hostilities and discussing `` the increasingly troubling humanitarian situation , '' according to a statement from his office . \nThe release criticized Gadhafi 's government for what it called `` disproportionate use of force and indiscriminate attacks on civilian targets . '' \nAfter reports of the opposition successfully fighting off pro-Gadhafi forces in Misrata , Libyan state TV showed a graphic -- in both Arabic and English -- saying that `` strict orders have been issued to the armed forces not to enter cities taken by terrorist gangs , who took civilians as human shields and threatened to slaughter the inhabitants of those cities . '' \nThe report cited `` military sources , '' and said those cities `` are being circled by the armed forces except those neighborhoods where the terrorist gangs have sought refuge . '' \nWhile the pro-Gadhafi rally in Tripoli was crowded and boisterous -- including the sounds of car horns and celebratory gunfire -- such demonstrations do not offer a clear sign of how much support the 68-year-old leader actually has . \nThroughout the uprising , which began February 15 , witnesses in Tripoli have described the government using all sorts of methods to drum up crowds , including forcibly dragging people to them , while keeping anti-Gadhafi demonstrators off the streets . \nOn Sunday , police forces searched cars to try to ensure that no anti-Gadhafi protesters were out on the streets , though some still managed to venture out , a witness said . \nTraces of bullets and blood could be seen in some districts near Tripoli 's Green Square , and people were mopping the streets and cleaning the walls , the witness said . \nOn Saturday , opposition forces had claimed two major successes : preventing pro-government forces from taking Zawiya and capturing Ras Lanuf along the coast . \nOpposition forces in eastern Libya briefly detained a group of British special forces . \nThe group was let go Sunday , British Foreign Secretary William Hague said in a statement . \n`` I can confirm that a small British diplomatic team has been in Benghazi . \nThe team went to Libya to initiate contacts with the opposition . \nThey experienced difficulties , which have now been satisfactorily resolved . \nThey have now left Libya , '' Hague said in a statement . \n`` We intend , in consultation with the opposition , to send a further team to strengthen our dialogue in due course . \nThis diplomatic effort is part of the UK 's wider work on Libya , including our ongoing humanitarian support . \nWe continue to press for Gadhafi to step down and we will work with the international community to support the legitimate ambitions of the Libyan people . '' \nThe strife engulfing the north African nation is reverberating across the country , the region and the world . \nDeath toll estimates range from more than 1,000 to as many as 2,000 , and the international community has been pondering strategies on how to end the violence and remove the Gadhafi regime . \nThe protesters are seeking the ouster of Gadhafi after nearly 42 years of ruling the country -- the kind of revolution that was seen in neighboring Tunisia and Egypt . \nBut unlike in those countries , the uprising has turned into warfare . \nBenjamin Barber , a fellow at the New York-based Demos think tank who had worked closely with the Gadhafi Foundation , told CNN 's Fareed Zakaria that he felt Gadhafi , his son Saif and their supporters would likely `` fight to the death '' -- meaning a prolonged war , compared to the relatively quick and peaceful political transition that happened in Egypt and Tunisia . \nEven if Gadhafi is somehow ousted , Barber predicted the violence could continue as tribes duke it out for supremacy in a nation that has few significant public institutions that could fill a potentially chaotic void . \nGadhafi 's government has been reviled across the globe for violence against civilians , and the International Criminal Court has launched an investigation of Gadhafi , some of his sons and other leaders for possible crimes against humanity . \nOpposition-controlled radio announced Saturday that the country 's sole legitimate representative was now the National Transitional Council , a group with 31 representatives for most of the regions in Libya . \nThe council held its first meeting Saturday in the eastern city of Benghazi . \nIt called Benghazi its temporary location until the `` liberation '' of the capital , according to a decree the council issued . \nFormer Justice Minister Mustafa Abdeljeleel , whom the council said had tried to resign from Gadhafi 's government several times , was announced as the council 's new leader . \nThe council also named a representative for military affairs and established a military council to oversee the `` liberation '' of Libya and reconstruct the armed forces , according to the radio announcement . \nThe council said its main missions are to represent all of Libya internationally , liberate the country , draft a constitution and hold elections . \nMeanwhile , the fierce fighting has sparked the flight of Libyans and foreigners out of Libya , with nations across the globe scrambling to help people leave . \nAlmost 200,000 people have fled Libya with nearly equal numbers going to Tunisia and Egypt , the United Nations refugee agency said . \nThe United States announced Saturday it is contributing $ 3 million to the International Organization for Migration to help return home thousands of non-Libyans who fled to Tunisia . \nCNN 's Nic Robertson , Ben Brumfield , Arwa Damon , Ben Wedeman , Salma Abdelaziz , Jomana Karadsheh , Jill Dougherty and Christine Theodorou contributed to this report \n"}

'' \nAs the fighting between opposition forces and Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi 's troops begins to look more like a civil war , expect prices to continue to rise , she said . \nPrices have risen nearly 82 cents since September 2010 , the survey found . \nWhile Libya is not among the top suppliers of U.S. oil , and only 3 % of Libyan oil exports head to the United States , global economics link the events there to the pumps at home . \nLibya produces a light , high-gravity crude oil that is most in demand by less complex refineries around the world , Lundberg said . \nAs this oil becomes unavailable , it forces buyers of crude to substitute crude with similar properties from other oil producers , thereby increasing demand and starting a chain reaction that raises prices of crude and gasoline in the United States . \nThe current average price of $ 3.51 is 61 cents below the all-time high price recorded in July 2008 . \nToday 's price is 78 cents higher than a year ago , Lundberg said . \nOn a side note , Lundberg noted that the rising gas prices could dampen the nation 's economic recovery . \nGas demand -- one of the reflections of the American economy -- has been growing at a rate of 1 % , she said . \n`` Higher prices today are certainly capable of halting that gasoline demand growth , which would reflect bad news in the economy , '' she said . \nThe Lundberg Survey sampled prices at about 2,500 gas stations . \nOf the cities surveyed , the highest average price in the continental United States was in San Diego at $ 3.87 per gallon . \nThe lowest price was in Billings , Montana , at $ 3.15 . \nCalifornia has garnered headlines lately for its high gas prices , though the average price in the state remained below $ 4 , at $ 3.83 per gallon for regular gas . \nThe average California price for premium does break that barrier , at $ 4.04 per gallon . \nAverage per-gallon prices in other cities : \n"}

'' \n`` By transforming political issues into moral causes , you raise the stakes of the conflict and you tend to demonize your opponents , '' Goldfield says . \nContemporary political rhetoric is filled with similar rhetoric . \nOpponents are n't just wrong -- they 're sinners , Goldfield says . \n`` The erosion of the center in contemporary American politics is the most striking parallel between today and the time just before the Civil War , '' Goldfield says . \nIn the lead-up to the war , political campaigns were filled with religious fervor . \nPolitical parties paraded their piety and labeled opponents infidels . \n`` Today 's government gridlock results , in part , from this religious mind set that many issues can be divided into good and evil and sin and salvation , '' he says . \nA Union artillery crew poses before battle . \nEach side underestimated the opposing army , historians say . \nHow much power should the federal government have ? \nNullification , states ' rights and secession . \nThose terms might sound like they 're lifted from a Civil War history book , but they 're actually making a comeback on the national stage today . \nSince the rise of the Tea Party and debate over the new health care law , more Republican lawmakers have brandished those terms . \nRepublican lawmakers in at least 11 states invoked nullification to thwart the new health care law , according to a recent USA Today article . \nIt was the kind of talk that led to the Civil War , historians say . \n`` One of the biggest debates during the Civil War was how far should governments go in dictating our lives . \nWe still debate those politics , '' says William Blair , director of the George and Ann Richards Civil War Era Center at Pennsylvania State University . \nThe Southern answer to that question ignited the war . \nWhen they seceded , their leaders said that they were protecting the inherent rights of sovereign states . \nThey invoked the 13 Colonies ' fight for independence . \nWe wanted to be left alone . \nWhat actually caused the war was Lincoln 's insistence that , no , we ca n't let these people go . \n-- H.W. Crocker III , Southern historian Civilians reenacting war as a hobby Budget threatened Civil War anniversary H.W. Crocker III , author of `` The Politically Incorrect Guide to the Civil War , '' says Southern secessionists were patriots reaffirming the Founding Fathers ' belief that the Colonies were free and independent states . \n`` If the Southern states pulled out of the union today after , say , the election of Barack Obama , or some other big political issue like abortion , how many of us would think the appropriate reaction from the federal government would be to blockade Southern ports and send armies into Virginia ? '' \nHe says men such as Jefferson Davis , the leader of the Confederacy , are American heroes . \n`` Jefferson Davis was not trying to force anything on the people in the North , '' he says . \n`` We wanted to be left alone . \nWhat actually caused the war is Lincoln 's insistence that no , we ca n't let these people go . '' \nSlavery caused the war , says McCurry , author of `` Confederate Reckoning , '' and most historians . \nSouthern slaveholders invoked the Revolution while trying to build an antidemocratic slave state `` dedicated to the proposition that all men are not created equal , '' McCurry says . \nThey also did n't want to lose the tremendous wealth generated by slave labor , she says . \n`` They felt confident because they were the biggest producers of cotton in the Western world at the height of the Industrial Revolution . '' \nUnleashing the dogs of war During the run-up to the Iraq War , former Vice President Dick Cheney famously declared that American troops would be welcomed as `` liberators '' in Iraq . \nCheney made the mistake that political leaders have been making for ages -- he did n't know the enemy , says Emory Thomas , author of `` The Dogs of War , '' which examines how ignorance on both sides led to the Civil War . \n`` Cheney thought it was going to be France in 1944 , but it ended up Georgia in 1864 , '' Thomas says . \nCivil War leaders made the same mistake , Thomas says . \nNorthern leaders like Lincoln did n't really think ordinary Southerners who had no slaves would fight in defense of slavery . \nSoutherners did n't think Northerners were willing to go to war to preserve the Union , he says . \nAnd few on both sides expected the war to be so bloody and long . \n`` America in 1861 did n't realize what the hell they were doing , '' he says . \n`` They just were n't willing to think of unpleasant possibilities . '' \nWe risk the same mistakes when we commit to `` limited '' military campaigns in places such as Iraq and , most recently , Libya , Thomas says . \nWhen President Obama announced a limited air bombing campaign in Libya , Thomas thought about the political leaders before the Civil War . \nEach incrementally committed to various military provocations , thinking events would n't spiral out of control . \n`` Once you commit to war , you do n't have any control over how it ends , '' Thomas says . \n`` It 's amazing how that sounds like Libya now . \nWe may blunder into success , but we do n't know who these guys -LRB- Libyan rebels -RRB- are . '' \nThe battlefields are quiet and even tranquil today , but the average Civil War soldier faced horror and exhaustion . \nBarack Obama is n't the first black president , according to some Southern secessionists . \nThat would be Abraham Lincoln . \nHe was called a `` black Republican '' and the `` Great Dictator . '' \nThere was a reason a large number of Americans despised Lincoln during the war . \nThink of the nation 's recent `` War on Terror . '' \nSome Americans thought Lincoln used the war to ignore the Constitution and expand the powers of the presidency . \nLincoln suspended habeas corpus -LRB- it gives a person who is jailed the right to challenge their detention in court -RRB- during the war and used military courts to arrests thousands of civilians . \nHow do we treat American citizens caught attempting to bomb U.S. cities ? \nHow do we clamp down on American citizens who preach overthrowing the government ? \nWhat rights do Guantanamo Bay prisoners possess ? \n`` It 's not just what does a president do against an enemy , '' says Blair , the Civil War historian . \n`` It 's what do you do against your own citizens to determine loyalty . \nThat 's a big debate today . '' \nLincoln skillfully addressed that debate , says Brian McGinty , author of `` Lincoln & the Court . '' \nHe says Lincoln confronted unprecedented problems : The South was in rebellion , the nation 's capital was in real danger from rebels in Virginia and their sympathizers in Maryland . \nAt one point , a mob blocked passage of Northern troops through Maryland to defend Washington . \n`` His oath of office required him to ` preserve , protect and defend the Constitution ' and he believed that the best way to do that was to preserve the Union , '' McGinty says . \n`` What good would the Constitution be if the country itself was lost ? '' \nMcGinty does n't think Lincoln became a dictator . \nHe says he allowed the presidential election to take place in 1864 . \nHe worked with Congress . \nHe asked military officers to arrest disloyal persons sparingly , and he never tolerated abuse of prisoners . \nLincoln said his actions would ultimately be subject to the review of the American people , not the courts , McGinty says . \n`` He called the people ` The Great Tribunal ' and said that they would have the final word on constitutional issues . \nIn the end , The Great Tribunal approved of what he had done . \nSo , for the most part , has history .

\nWas this decision based on economic considerations or was there some reason that you really felt that he was the best thinker for the show ? \nWas it not possible to find an African ? \nIn addition Kristof 's comments on certain things was borderline offensive . \nProblems of disease left him with '' `` a bad taste about West Africa .

'' \nI 'm worried about the ways that jingoistic and romantic narratives about American exceptionalism and innovation can creep into otherwise critical and serious journalism . \nJuly 10 , 2011 at 1:55 pm | Reply I have recently become a regular viewer of GPS because of its content , particularly its different perspectives than the other Sunday shows . \nToday , however , in viewing the 1:00 PM airing , I was annoyed by the amount of time used for commercials , everything from Shirley Temple to Funeral Services . \nWhile I did not time them , the one hour show must have had 15-20 minutes of commercials . \nThis is too much ! \nJuly 10 , 2011 at 2:05 pm | Reply I concur with most of the comments about Africa above , but I am most concerned about the patronizing , disingenuous manner in which you and your guests characterize some African countries as successful , especially Ghana . \nFree and fair elections does n't a nation build . \nIt is easy to visit Ghana for a while , and be fawned over by the `` natives '' , knowing that you will eventually return to your cozy quarters in the West . \nYour comments will have more relevance if you lived there permanently and had to deal with the open sewers , the bad roads , the lack of amenities , and the decadent corruption , corruption so vicious that high officials vie for office to claim it thereby embedding it in institutional structures . \nSuch laudatory comments appear to be designed to pacify and patronize , a sentiment evidenced by the lack of representation on your show . \nGhana is a mess and the seeming relative progress vis-a-vis other countries in Africa is a sham . \nWith more than 30 % of GDP in foreign debt , and a pittance 10 % of GDP in revenue from offshore oil discoveries , it is only a matter of time before all the citizens and land resources are held for ransom . \nIf Ghana is a success , then Africa as a whole is in big trouble . \nJuly 10 , 2011 at 2:40 pm | Reply I wanted to add my voice to the outrage expressed so well by Shea , Khadijah and others here . \nFareed , you more than any other talking head on TV , should have enough common sense to have INDIGENOUS AFRICANS participating in a discussion of countries on the African continent !

'' \nAl-Zawiya is strategically important because the coastal road through the city is the main supply line from the Tunisian border to areas held by Gadhafi . \nHis weapon of choice ? \nHis brush Government spokesman Musa Ibrahim said fewer than 100 rebels moved in on al-Zawiya from the southern side of the city , but were stopped . \nAnother group of fewer than 50 rebels was waiting inside the city , but `` took action too early , '' he said , adding that the group is still on the run . \n`` They are mad . \n... This is not an advance . \nThis is what you call a skirmish , what you call a suicide mission , '' Ibrahim said , noting that al-Zawiya is the country 's third-largest city . \nWhile forces loyal to the Libyan leader tried to defend the capital from the west , rebels announced that they had cut off an important military supply route to the south . \nSixty miles to Tripoli 's south , rebels said they captured the town of Garyan and pushed the Gadhafi forces to the south , cutting them off from the road to Tripoli . \nThe soldiers left behind heavy artillery and ammunition , rebel field commander Adel al-Zintani told CNN . \n`` We captured many anti-aircraft artillery vehicles , two full fuel tankers and 106 anti-tank piercing artillery and shells , '' he said . \nSeven people were injured in the clashes , he said . \n`` The rebels have 95 % control of Garyan and have surrounded a Gadhafi brigade inside a military camp inside Garyan , '' said the spokesman in the media office of the Military Council of the Western Mountain Region . \nFinally , in the opposition-held port of Misrata , missile attacks by Gadhafi forces ended after rebels captured the nearby town of Tawargha , National Transitional Council spokesman Guma El-Gamaty told CNN . \nThat city was being used by Gadhafi forces to launch missiles indiscriminately into Misrata , he said . \nRebels also took a crucial bridge that links Tawargha to Sirte , Gadhafi 's hometown and loyal stronghold , he said . \nHowever , Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim said government fighters had pushed the rebels away from Tawargha and back to Misrata . \nIbrahim also downplayed the rebel claims in other towns . \n`` Small groups of armed gangs , 50 here , 50 there , some attacked south of al-Zawiya , some attacked north of Garyan , and Tawargha , but they have very weak influence on the ground , '' government spokesman Musa Ibrahim told reporters . \n`` The people 's armed forces are dealing with them , they do not represent a real threat . \nTripoli is safe . '' \nHe later noted that Gadhafi 's forces are `` very strong '' and have the support of `` thousands upon thousands '' of armed volunteers . \n`` You have to remember we are very powerful , '' Ibrahim said . \n`` The tens of thousands and tens of thousands of volunteers are armed right now . \nIt does n't matter whether NATO advances or not , whether rebels advance or not , because we will always be able to fight , in a year 's time , in two years , in three years . '' \nFive months into the Libyan war , the rebels have won international support in their effort to oust Gadhafi . \nThey have been aided by NATO airstrikes that began in March after the U.N. Security Council approved a resolution that ordered civilians be protected . \nThis week , the government accused NATO of killing 85 civilians , including 33 children , in airstrikes Monday near the embattled city of Zlitan . \nNATO has said there is no evidence that the strikes killed civilians , though journalists , including CNN reporters , taken by Gadhafi 's government to the site of the strikes , reported seeing bodies of women and children . \nIt was impossible for CNN to confirm the extent of the casualties and if they were all civilian . \nKaim on Friday criticized the United Nations for what he claimed was an organizational silence over claims that NATO has violated the mandate of the Security Council by killing civilians and conducting a naval blockade . \nIbrahim renewed the government 's accusations Saturday , saying NATO is aiding the rebels , whom he described as `` armed gangs . '' \nThe comments follow a statement a day earlier by a spokesperson for Ban Ki-moon , who said the U.N. secretary-general `` is deeply concerned by reports of the unacceptably large number of civilian casualties as a result of the conflict in Libya . '' \nBan urged `` all Libyan parties '' to engage with his special envoy , Abdel-Elah Al-Khatib , `` and respond concretely and positively to the ideas presented to them , in order to end the bloodshed in the country , '' the spokesperson said . \nIbrahim repeated Saturday his own calls for an end to the conflict , telling NATO : `` Stop this aggression and let 's talk peace .

'' \nAbdulmolah did not know what kind of helicopters the rebel forces used in Saturday 's attack and could not confirm whether rebel forces coordinated the operation with NATO . \nNATO is operating under a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing the use of force to protect Libyan civilians from attack . \nThe United Nations said Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon will travel to Cairo Thursday to head meetings on Libya at the Arab League headquarters . \nAmong the participants will be Catherine Ashton , the representative for foreign affairs and security for the European Union . \nWhile Gadhafi has largely stayed out of the public eye in recent days , state TV aired images Saturday of the leader visiting what appeared to be a primary school in Tripoli . \nThe anchor said the school was a target of international airstrikes and was going to be attacked . \nBut NATO said in its statement that Gadhafi 's forces continue to use civilians as human shields . \n`` We have observed horrific examples of regime forces deliberately placing their weapons systems close to civilians , their homes and even their places of worship , '' said Lt. Gen. Charlie Bouchard , commander of NATO 's Operation Unified Protector . \n`` Troops have also been observed hiding behind women and children . \nThis type of behavior violates the principles of international law and will not be tolerated .

'' \none of the fighters told me . \n`` The army is coming here , they 'll be here soon , '' said another . \n`` You must go now , '' the hotel manager told me . \n`` It 's not safe in Ras Lanuf . '' \nThe television in the lobby was tuned to the Arabic satellite news channel Al-Arabiya , which was flashing that Libyan government forces had taken up defensive positions around Ras Lanuf , which had been taken over by anti-Qaddafi rebels two days before . \nThe rebels had advanced beyond Ras Lanuf , by about 30 kilometers , to the town of Bin Jawad , but were pushed out within hours . \nTheir advance westward , begun in the refinery town of Al-Brega , had come to a screeching halt . \nAnd now it was beginning to look as if the tide was turning . \nAs we waited in the lobby , I had visions of the Libyan army pulling up outside the hotel , rounding us all up and taking us back to Tripoli , hands bound and blindfolded , to be put on trial . \nLibyan state television had announced that all journalists who had entered the country from Egypt without visas would be considered outlaws and , worse , collaborators with al Qaeda . \nAs the first Western television journalist to enter Libya from Egypt during the current crisis , I had reliable information I was high on Tripoli 's wanted list . \nI watched as the Ras Lanuf press corps bundled into cars , or onto the back of pickup trucks , and drove away in the dark . \nWe decided to wait until first light before moving . \nIn the meantime , the hotel staff was removing the big flat-screen TV in the lobby , and desktop computers and printers from behind the reception desk and back offices . \nAfter the other journalists had left , the cleaning staff -- migrant workers from Bangladesh -- cleared away dozens of paper coffee cups , mopped the floor and emptied ashtrays overflowing with the butts of dozens of jumpy journalists . \nWhen it became light , instead of going east -- away from the supposedly advancing Libyan army -- we and a crew from the BBC went west , toward Bin Jawad , to see if there was any truth to the claims Gadhafi 's men were on the move . \nLibya witness : Rockets on the ground Searching the Gadhafi family tree We drove slowly , stopping regularly to survey the terrain , to ask any fighters along the way about what they had seen and what they knew about the front lines . \nThe few we met assured us the government forces were still on the outskirts of Bin Jawad and were n't moving forward . \nIt was disconcerting , however , that as we continued to drive , there was almost no one to speak with . \nThe usual gatherings of boisterous , friendly rebel fighters gathered around cars , pickup trucks and Chinese - and Soviet-made anti-aircraft guns were nowhere to be seen . \nThe road was almost empty . \nWe stopped one last time about five kilometers east of Bin Jawad . \nThree kilometers away we could see something blocking the road . \nThe BBC crew , who had a bigger and better camera , went a bit further to get a better look , but after about five minutes came racing back , lights flashing . \nMeanwhile , we heard a jet overhead . \nWe 'd had two close misses with bombs a few days before , so we jumped to the side of the road , ready to lie flat in the sand in case they bombed again . \nIn the distance we heard the loud , hollow pop of anti-aircraft fire . \nThe plane flew in a wide arch twice above us , but dropped no bombs . \nWhen it flew on , we regrouped with the BBC crew , who recounted that while videotaping down the road , a shot had been fired over their heads . \nThe cameraman said he saw in his viewfinder vehicles pointing east toward Ras Lanuf , and men who were all wearing identical uniforms . \nThat did n't sound like the motley opposition forces . \nAnd if they had been opposition forces , they would have opened fire with everything they had on the jet above . \nBut they did n't . \nIn other words , those dots down the road were probably soldiers from the Libyan Army . \nDriving back toward Ras Lanuf , we saw a huge plume of black smoke and brown dust a few kilometers up ahead . \nLibyan Air Force jets were attempting to bomb rebel targets again . \nIt was just one of many such air strikes in the area Monday . \nAlong the main Benghazi-Tripoli road that skirts Ras Lanuf , we found groups of opposition fighters chanting and joking about Gadhafi `` the dog , '' Gadhafi `` the donkey , '' but it was beginning to all ring hollow . \nThere seemed to be less of them about , and fewer and fewer appeared to be moving to the front . \nWe returned to the hotel in mid-afternoon . \nIt was open again , but the staff had fled . \nThe new `` staff '' was comprised of men and teenagers with machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades . \nThey were going from room to room , turning on the TVs , using the bathrooms , calling to their friends from the balconies . \nIn the parking lot outside , they regularly fired rounds from their automatic weapons . \nAlthough I did n't see it , a print reporter friend told me they had spent much of the afternoon smoking hashish . \nTo borrow a line from one of my old scripts , `` morale is high , and so are the troops . '' \nIn the coffee shop , more fighters were crowded behind the bar , helping themselves to whatever was available , handing out bowls of cornflakes with milk and chocolate syrup . \nPickup trucks had pulled up in front of the hotel , and they were loading them with food and crockery from the kitchen . \nTheoretically , I suppose , they were commandeering supplies for opposition forces in the area . \nAll the while , they were eager to reassure the few journalists who had returned in the hopes of spending another night in the Fadeel Hotel that all was well , that they would be safe , that they would sleep soundly . \nThe more insistent their reassurances , however , the more tenuous the prospect of a night at the hotel became . \nThe thought of stoned adolescents armed to the teeth stumbling around the halls at night , in addition to the very real possibility of a nighttime assault by the Libyan army on Ras Lanuf , was more than even the most battle-hardened war correspondents cared to ponder . \nThe CNN crew was among the last guests to leave the hotel just after sunset . \nThere was no need to settle the bill or return the keys . \n"}

Last week I authorised the despatch of a small British diplomatic team to Eastern Libya , in uncertain circumstances which we judged required their protection , to build on these initial contacts and to assess the scope for closer diplomatic dialogue . \nI pay tribute to that team . \nThey were withdrawn yesterday after a serious misunderstanding about their role leading to their temporary detention . \nThe British opposition smells blood . \nShadow Foreign Secretary , Douglas Alexander is accusing the government of `` serial bungling , '' saying that `` The British public are entitled to wonder whether , if some new neighbors moved into the Foreign Secretary 's street , he would introduce himself by ringing the doorbell or instead choose to climb over the fence in the middle of the night ? '' \nMenzies Campbell , a former opposition leader from the Liberal Democrats , called the mission `` ill-conceived , poorly planned and embarrassingly executed .

{"id": "259", "time": "2011-04-17", "text": "By the CNN Wire Staff Conflict continues in Misrata , Libya NEW : Hundreds in Tripoli rally for Gadhafi , some vowing to act as ` human shields ' Witness : Gadhafi 's forces are using explosives that can kill indiscriminately A hail of rockets attack Misrata again Saturday Transitional council leader says the rebels need weapons Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- For all the talk in diplomatic circles this week of finding peace for Libya , one thing remained clear Saturday : The war is raging unabated in Misrata . \nIn the city under siege from Moammar Gadhafi 's forces and mostly inaccessible for journalists , other than those on government-organized tours , residents reported disturbing new developments Saturday . \nAn opposition council member told CNN that loyalists were using bombs that look like perfume bottles . \nPhotographs suggested they were shells fired from a grenade launcher that either did not explode on impact or were deliberately masked and placed in populated areas . \nEither way , they were proving lethal . \nThe council member said Saturday that people have had their limbs blown off and children have been killed . \nGadhafi accused of using illegal weapons The report comes a day after Human Rights Watch reported its members saw three cluster bombs explode Thursday night over Misrata 's el-Shawahda neighborhood . \nResearchers with the activist group inspected debris and interviewed witnesses about two other apparent cluster bombings , the report said . \n`` We hear explosions that sound like one big explosion followed by many smaller ones . \nWe were told this is a cluster bomb , '' said the council member . \nHe , like many other Libyans , did not want to be identified for safety reasons . \nThe Libyan government has denied the use of such bombs , which are banned internationally because of their indiscriminate nature and ability to harm civilians even after a conflict ends . \nAhmed Hassan of the Misrata opposition council said at least five people were killed and 44 others were wounded Saturday , after one witness saw a hail of rockets fall on the central Libyan city . \nGadhafi 's forces also bombed several food and dairy production factories , including ones that produce milk and oil , Hassan said . \nTerrified residents are going out in groups of 20 or 30 to fetch bread . \nThey are too scared to venture out alone . \n`` No one and nowhere is safe in Misrata , '' Hassan said . \nMedecins Sans Frontieres said Saturday that it had evacuated nearly 100 people by boat from Misrata . \nMost were suffering war-related injuries . \nThe boat arrived in Zarzis , Tunisia , on Saturday . \nThe international medical humanitarian group -LRB- known as Doctors Without Borders in English -RRB- said ongoing fighting has cut off people from medical assistance and hospitals and clinics are overwhelmed with casualties . \n`` For weeks now , health structures have been struggling to cope with the influx of patients , '' said Dr. Morten Rostrup , an MSF doctor who participated in the evacuation . \n`` With the latest heavy bombardments in Misrata , the situation is worsening as hospitals have to discharge patients before their treatment is completed in order to treat those wounded by fighting , '' Rostrup said in a statement . \nThe International Organization for Migration said Saturday that a chartered boat filled with hundreds of tons of humanitarian aid was heading to Misrata . \nThe group 's first boat rescued 1,200 migrant workers and their families who had been stranded around the city 's port , which has been bombarded daily by Gadhafi 's forces according to witnesses . \nDeeper inside the city , witnesses for weeks have reported dire conditions , including food shortages and the persistent fear of pro-Gadhafi snipers taking aim at anyone walking on the streets . \nA clinic director told CNN at least 700 people have died since the violence erupted in Misrata two months ago . \nMeanwhile , a Misrata opposition council member accused Gadhafi of using Libyan state television as an effective command-and-control center after NATO airstrikes damaged lines of communications and made troop control difficult . \nThe council member said Gadhafi has been sending orders to his troops through coded messages aired on state television and the rebels have been trying to decode them in order to defend themselves . \nHe gave these examples : -- An anchor claimed that a bird laid a green egg in an area of Benghazi . \nThe anchor hailed this as a miracle and a sign of an upcoming victory for Gadhafi 's forces . \nThe next day that exact area was attacked by what the councilman described as sleeper cells in Benghazi . \n-- During the weather forecast , a map indicated a large storm over the port area of Misrata . \nNo storm ever appeared , but the next day Gadhafi 's forces attacked Misrata by sea . \n-- An anchor claimed that a honey bee spelled out Moammar with honey in Darnah . \nOnce again , it was hailed as a miracle and a sign of an upcoming victory for Gadhafi 's forces . \nThe next day , sleeper cells in Darnah launched an attack . \nDespite weeks of aerial bombardment by international fighter jets , Gadhafi has shown no signs of acquiescing . \nHe remains as defiant as ever despite calls this week again from global leaders attending a Libya conference in Qatar and a sternly worded newspaper opinion piece by U.S. President Barack Obama , French President Nicolas Sarkozy and British Prime Minister David Cameron . \nBut how to protect civilians has become an increasingly complex question . \nAt a news conference in Benghazi , the deputy chairman of Libya 's Transitional National Council appealed to the international community to help prevent further tragedy . \nHe said 1.5 million Libyans were under attack every day . \n`` We already have warned before that the regime was threatening real massacres against innocent civilians , '' Abdul Hafiz Ghoga told reporters . \n`` The international community is now witnessing what this regime is capable of . \nThe destruction in Misrata and other cities is unacceptable . '' \nIn Tripoli , four thundering explosions were heard Saturday evening -- believed to have been caused by NATO airstrikes -- followed by about 30 minutes of sustained anti-aircraft fire . \nLater that night , hundreds gathered outside Gadhafi 's compound in the capital , with some saying they 'd be willing to act as `` human shields '' as long as NATO warplanes targeted the manpower and infrastructure being used in support of the Libyan leader . \n`` Everyone here will die for Moammar Gadhafi , '' one young man told CNN . \nOn the eastern front lines of the battle , rebels were still fighting to regain control of the oil town of al-Brega , which has changed hands several times already . \n`` We need weapons to defend our people , '' Ghoga said . \nNATO has said it needs more precision fighter jets because loyalist maneuvers have made airstrikes much more difficult without harming civilians . \n`` Now they hide their heavy arms in populated areas , where before many targets were easier to get to , '' said NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen earlier this week . \n`` To avoid civilian casualties , we need very sophisticated equipment . \nSo we need a few more precision fighter ground-attack aircraft for air-to-ground missions . '' \nA witness in Misrata said NATO planes were flying overhead Saturday , but he had not seen evidence of bombing . \nCNN 's Reza Sayah , Fred Pleitgen , Saad Abedine , Salma Abdelaziz , Mitra Mobasherat and Hamdi Alkhshali contributed to this report \n"}
{"id": "379", "time": "2011-07-30", "text": "By Joe Sterling and Ivan Watson , CNN Details murky on Libya rebel chief death NEW : Younis ' killing is `` more proof that the transitional council of the traitors is not able to lead , '' says Ibrahim The death of the top rebel commander in Libya stokes speculation of a rebel rift An ex-ambassador says `` revenge by Tripoli '' is the `` most likely scenario '' One expert says the death is a reminder of the rebel coalition 's fragility Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The killing on Thursday of the top rebel military commander shows that those forces are in disarray , a spokesman for Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi said Friday . \nGen. Abdul Fattah Younis and two other rebels were killed after the country 's main rebel organization , the Transitional National Council , sought to question him about military matters and allegations that he or those close to him had ongoing ties to Gadhafi , Younis ' supporters said . \nYounis ' killing represents `` more proof that the transitional council of the traitors is not able to lead any sort of government or have any control of eastern cities of Libya , '' said Musa Ibrahim , the Gadhafi spokesman . \nIbrahim accused two members of al Qaeda of having arrested Younis with the help of the Transitional National Council and subsequently charging Younis with treason for `` betraying the cause . '' \nBut the abductors knew that a fair trial would have been lengthy and that Younis ' tribe would have intervened to help him , so they killed him , Ibrahim said . \n`` He was shot and his body was immediately disfigured , '' he added . \nThe killing shows that `` al Qaeda is the real power among the rebels , '' he said , repeating Gadhafi 's assertion that rebel forces are allied with al Qaeda . \n`` They have the most soldiers ; they have the training ; they have the weapons ; they have the faith -- a wicked faith ; they have the strategies . '' \nThe killing also sends a powerful message to other tribes : `` Try to exclude us from your settlement , your political settlement , and this is your fate , '' Ibrahim said . \nYounis was killed along with a colonel and a lieutenant colonel , the Transitional National Council said in a prepared statement . \nNo further details were immediately released . \nMohammad Ethish , a member of a rebel military council , released a statement that seemed to imply that Gadhafi loyalists had something to do with the death . \n`` This incident will increase the will and courage of the rebels , and it will even get us close together to reach the home of the tyrant , '' Ethish said . \n`` We promise our brothers in the East that we will do the impossible to avenge the death of Abdul Fattah Younis , and we promise that we will increase our blows and empower our will . \nUntil we capture the tyrant Moammar Gadhafi . '' \nThe deaths have provoked questions and stirred speculation that they might cause a rift among opposition leaders . \n`` We really do n't know what happened yet , '' said Marina Ottaway , senior associate of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace 's Middle East program . \n`` Politically , it 's a reminder of how tenuous a coalition it is . '' \nRebels have been battling government troops in a fight to oust Gadhafi , who has ruled the North African nation for nearly 42 years . \nNATO has used air power to enforce a U.N. resolution protecting civilians from the regime , and world powers have announced their support for Libya 's rebel umbrella group . \nThis week , the United Kingdom joined the United States and other Western powers in recognizing the TNC as the legitimate governing authority in Libya , a decision that could steer millions of dollars to the opposition . \nYounis had served as interior minister in Gadhafi 's government until February , when he defected to the Benghazi-based rebel movement . \nA onetime general in Gadhafi 's army , Younis told CNN in February that he switched sides after Gadhafi told him he planned to bomb Benghazi -- a move Younis said would have killed thousands . \nA young man in a tan uniform who spoke in Benghazi after Friday Muslim prayers said on rebel TV that Younis `` was assassinated by him like the other martyrs of Libya '' and called for `` revenge for everyone who took part in this crime . '' \nIt was n't clear whom he was implicating in Younis ' death . \nThe man said that `` knowing the truth of what happened to him and avenging his death is a debt every Libyan man and woman owes . \nMy message to Mustafa Abdel Jalil is we will be with you on this path , '' the man said , referring to the leader of the rebels ' government . \nAlistair Burt , the British Foreign Office 's minister for the Middle East and North Africa , said , `` Exactly what happened remains unclear . '' \nHe added that the `` killing will be thoroughly investigated . '' \n`` We agreed that it is important that those responsible are held to account through proper judicial processes . '' \nSir Richard Dalton , a former British ambassador to Libya and associate fellow for the Middle East and North Africa Programme of the London-based Chatham House , said `` one scenario is revenge by Tripoli . '' \nHowever , Dalton said , the ultimate impact of the killing on the opposition movement will depend on the facts that emerge about the killing . \n`` They 've been promising it for a while , '' he said of the Gadhafi government . \n`` Right from the start , they 've threatened people who 've turned away . \nThere are stories that AFY -LRB- Younis -RRB- had rebuffed approaches by Tripoli . '' \nThere have been tensions between different parts of the opposition forces , Dalton said . \nSo a `` second hypothesis '' is that a quarrel got `` out of hand . \nBut he warned not to jump to conclusions about the significance of a `` single episode . '' \n`` We have n't got much to go on , '' he said . \n`` I think our governments will find out soon . '' \nOttaway , the Carnegie Endowment scholar , said the killing raises questions about the rebel council . \n`` It 's clear there are divisions '' within the Transitional National Council , she said . \n`` There are suspicions of some of the people who went from being close allies -LRB- of Gadhafi -RRB- , as Younis was , to joining '' the rebels . \nThe motives of those who switched sides have been questioned by people who were n't sure whether they had truly made the transition or were just pretending to have changed . \nThere has been speculation , she said , that Younis might have been dealing somehow with Gadhafi . \n`` The main point perhaps is that the unity at the Transitional National Council is tenuous at best . \nThis is a strange coalition at best , '' she said . \n`` They are very aware of the fact that they are not an organization that represents the entire country . '' \nAs for how the killing might affect the rebels ' military effort , Ottaway said it 's not clear how much control Younis had . \nShe pointed out that the killing occurred on the same day rebels embarked on an offensive in western Libya . \nThe fighters said their forces captured five towns and surrounded a sixth in the plains below the Nafusa mountain range , which borders Tunisia . \nMark Quarterman , a senior adviser and director of the Center for Strategic and InternationalStudies ' Program on Crisis , Conflict and Cooperation , said the `` potential implications '' of the death are `` very worrisome '' and could help the Gadhafi regime in the short run . \nThe death has had the effect of `` roiling rebel politics , '' Quarterman said . \nThe killing has fomented anger among members of Younis ' Obeidi tribe , according to news reports . \nQuarterman , an expert on the Libyan crisis , said the killing undermines the bet NATO powers have made that , by enforcing the U.N. resolution protecting Libyans , they would give rebels space to defeat Gadhafi forces . \nQuarterman noted that Younis had been engaged in a dispute with another rebel commander , Khalifa Hifter . \n`` They seem unable to take and hold territory . \nThis makes things worse , '' Quarterman said . \n`` You ca n't have a lot of faith and confidence in forces saying , ` I 'm the commander , no I 'm the commander . ' \n`` If this disarray does continue , this only benefits Gadhafi . \nAnd it makes the coming of a post-Gadhafi Libya that much more distant . '' \nThere has been talk among world powers about negotiated settlements and scenarios that could include Gadhafi remaining in Libya after the conflict ends , Quarterman said . \nThe international sense that the conflict would end quickly with `` capitulation on the part of the Gadhafi regime is fading , '' Quarterman said . \n`` As a result , the end game is seeming much more murky . '' \nIvan Watson reported from Tripoli and Joe Sterling reported from Atlanta . \n"}

Security Council resolution authorizing any means necessary -- with the exception of foreign occupation -- to protect civilians . \nWitnesses said three people were killed and several were wounded after government shells detonated Tuesday near a refugee camp in the critical port area . \nThousands of migrants have been housed there as they wait for ships to carry them to safety . \nOpposition forces said they believe that , had NATO forces not intervened with air attacks Tuesday night , the shelling would have continued . \nNATO said six military vehicles , seven technical vehicles and a surface-to-air missile launcher were targeted on Tuesday in the vicinity of Misrata . \nThough Gadhafi 's regime said last week that it was going to suspend operations in Misrata and let tribes deal with the rebels , heavy shelling suggests pro-government forces are n't done with the city . \nAs many as 1,500 migrants are believed to remain in Misrata in need of evacuation , IOM said . \nIn recent weeks , nearly 626,000 people have abandoned Libya for Tunisia , Egypt , Niger , Algeria , Chad and Sudan , it said . \nSome 615,000 people , including large numbers of third-country nationals , have fled Libya , more than 10,000 from Misrata . \nMisrata , the third-largest city in the North African country , has been hemmed in on three sides by Gadhafi 's forces . \nThough rebels said they had gained control of the city 's center and had pushed government forces outside the city , they said Gadhafi 's forces were continuing to attack Misrata with heavy weaponry . \nThe port has served as a crucial route of escape and as a lifeline to humanitarian aid . \nCNN 's Frederik Pleitgen , Elise Labott , Raja Razek , Saad Abedine and Joe Sterling contributed to this report . \n"}

'' \nEach generation of journalists finds its own answers to that deceptively simple question . \nAdvances in picture and audio technology , coupled with warp-speed mobile communications , have transformed newsgathering . \nBut the essentials of sketching out the first draft of history , whether in words or in images , are the same . \nThe only way to capture the truth is to get close to it . \nDespite powerful telephoto lenses , conflict photographers still work much like Robert Capa , who used a simple Contax camera to capture the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s . \nHetherington and Hondros , who won the Robert Capa Gold Medal for his work in Iraq , understood the catalyzing power of the still image . \nTheir work freezes the flow of blood or tears on a human face , rendering the real cost of fighting in Afghanistan , the Middle East , Africa and the Balkans . \nThey knew that a single image , like the napalmed Vietnamese girl running from her burning village , can crystallize a whole war . \nTheir work freezes the flow of blood or tears on a human face , rendering the real cost of fighting . \nThat is why they were in the thick of bullets and mortar bombs in Misrata . \nNow , unfortunately , they join a tragically high honor roll of journalists who have given their lives to bear witness . \nThe Committee to Protect Journalists has documented the deaths of 861 journalists over the past two decades . \nIn that period , 150 have been killed directly in combat . \nOf those , about half were photojournalists or camera operators . \nLast year , 40 % of journalists who died in the line of duty were killed in combat-related crossfire and in dangerous assignments such as street protests . \nAnd this year , because of the uprisings in the Middle East , 12 of the 16 journalists killed worldwide have died covering combat or on dangerous assignments . \nLibya , with four combat deaths and brutal detentions of journalists , is especially dangerous for the press . \nThe fighting is chaotic , with fluid or nonexistent front lines . \nIrregulars , soldiers without uniforms , pro-Gadhafi forces moving among civilians and firing into populated urban areas , all make for a deadly maze through which unprotected journalists must thread a path . \nUnlike the U.S.-prosecuted wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , journalists in Libya are not embedded with any military . \nHetherington and Hondros had worked as both `` embeds '' and unilaterals , the military jargon for those journalists who go it alone . \nIt was extremely difficult , if not impossible , to cover the fighting in both U.S. theaters without the army . \nHetherington turned this to his advantage brilliantly by co-directing the 2010 Oscar-nominated '' Restrepo , '' a film about a year spent on a forward operating base in Afghanistan with U.S. troops . \nLibya , with four combat deaths and brutal detentions of journalists , is especially dangerous for the press . \nHetherington and Hondros knew from training and experience how to handle themselves in combat . \nAs a photojournalist , you learn where to stand to shoot , what to wear , how to approach combatants , how to hire a driver , a fixer , an interpreter , how to choose a hotel , and on and on . \nAny journalist may wear a bulletproof vest and a helmet . \nBut in the end , reporters are exposed . \nMortar rounds and rocket-propelled grenades like those whizzing through the streets of Misrata are no respecters of Kevlar chest plates . \nHetherington and Hondros were not alone . \nTwo other colleagues with them on the street were wounded in the same attack . \nTo the east , still other photographers and reporters are missing or in detention , grabbed by pro-Tripoli forces . \nIn the eight weeks since this civil war erupted , the Committee to Protect Journalists has documented more than 80 attacks on the press , including the killing of a cameraman for Al-Jazeera and reporter for Libya Al-Hurra TV . \nAs of today , 17 journalists are missing or in detention , among them three photojournalists : Spaniard Manuel Varela , European Pressphoto Agency ; South African Anton Hammerl , Christian Science Monitor ; and American James Foley , Global Post . \nWe never will get to hear Chris Hondros ' thoughts on covering war next week at the International Center of Photography . \nHe already gave his answer by venturing onto Tripoli Street in Misrata with his camera . \n"}

'' \nNot sure because from the very beginning , U.S. President Barack Obama and his European counterparts have made it expressly clear that the Libyan campaign is not about regime change . \nThe airstrikes began in mid-March under a United Nations mandate to protect civilians , and NATO has been cautious to operate under that threshold , even when three of its members -- Britain , France and Italy -- decided this week to send military advisers to Benghazi . \nThe choice to act in Libya came when it appeared the opposition effort -- previously implausible in a nation that has known only the iron grip of Gadhafi for more than 40 long years -- faced a series of setbacks that made massacre seem imminent in Benghazi . \nSome now believe that had Western powers intervened earlier , when the rebels were high on momentum in their march westward , the situation might be different . \n`` Had they really kept the pressure on Gadhafi , I do n't think we would be having this debate , '' said analyst Jawad al-Anani , a former deputy prime minister of Jordan . \n`` Somehow there was a slack in the operation . '' \nA `` slack , '' perhaps due to Obama 's reluctance to get U.S. troops -- already deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq -- involved in a third war . \nEven this week , the White House remained adamant there will be no U.S. ground forces in Libya , not even any advisers . \nBut al-Anani is sure no one in the Arab world believes that the West was not salivating at the idea of a Gadhafi-free Libya . \n`` It could have been done easily , '' he said . \n`` This should have been Grenada , not Vietnam . '' \n`` Vietnam '' was one of the words used this week as word of advisers came out . \n`` Quagmire '' and `` mission creep '' also surfaced in a flurry of opinion on Libya . \n` Slippery slope ' in Libya mission Paris promises made to aid Libya rebels The alliance 's secretary general has asked for more precision fighter jets so as to avoid civilian casualties as the bombardment continues . \nFrance and Britain last week aired a desire to get more aggressive . \nThe allure of precision bombing from the air is that it can reduce troop losses . \nIt is `` an unusually seductive form of military strength , in part because , like modern courtship , it appears to offer gratification without commitment , '' former State Department adviser Eliot Cohen famously wrote after directing a U.S. Air Force Persian Gulf War air power survey . \nIts limitations were learned in other conflicts . \n`` The examples of Mogadishu in Somalia , Rwanda , Bosnia and Kosovo will have played quite heavily in the minds of European policymakers , '' said Alexis Crow of the London-based think tank Chatham House . \n`` In trying to stop a humanitarian disaster , one thing that has been learned from these experiences is that you have got to have a ` hammer and anvil strategy , ' which is airpower combined with a complement of ground troops in order to stop things like ethnic cleansing happening , '' Crow said . \nIf the goal , however , is to establish a Libya without Gadhafi , then it seems likely that a greater military effort will be required , said Jon Alterman , director of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington . \n`` But it 's hard to get international consensus that supports military force deposing a government , '' he said , citing the Iraq example . \nThat was a $ 1 trillion effort that did not garner widespread international support , he said . \nThe Europeans , Alterman said , have relied on U.S. leadership in the past . \nBut with the White House playing a secondary role in this effort , they are struggling to mount a sustained campaign . \nIt 's too early to speak in terms of Vietnam , Alterman said . \nBut certainly , a key expectation is that the impasse will be broken soon ; that the rebels have to be a more effective fighting force . \nThere are , of course , a host of different scenarios for Libya , which have been debated to no end by observers of this war . \nGadhafi could fall soon , though it seems unlikely . \nHe could hang on to power for weeks , months or maybe years , fueled by oil resources in southern Libya . \nOr the country could be split in two . \n`` Two weeks from now , Gadhafi will certainly be in power , '' said W. Andrew Terrill , a research professor at the Strategic Studies Institute of the U.S. Army War College . \n`` I do n't think major cities will exchange hands . \nIt 's not going to be any major offenses . \nNeither side has enough combat power . '' \nTerrill said the threshold to trigger an invasion with troops on the ground has to be high and has not yet been reached in Libya . \nGadhafi is killing his people but it 's not a genocide when you consider the number of deaths , reported in the hundreds in Misrata , which has half a million people , he said . \n`` That 's a tragedy , but we 're still not talking genocide , '' Terrill said . \nPolitical scientist Ali Ahmida said this week what he has said all along as he watches his homeland mired in conflict : `` It is not going to be easy . '' \nAs much as he would like to see Libya prosper under freedom , Ahmida , a professor at the University of New England , said he can not support a NATO invasion . \n`` I am against any military intervention in Libya , '' he said . \n`` The people are wary of that . \nThey had a horrible colonial experience and the generation of independence made a big mistake by aligning so closely with the United Kingdom and the United States . '' \nBut NATO has already upped the ante with military advisers on the ground , Keane said . \nAnd history has proven , he said , that once you engage militarily , events take on a life of their own . \nIn Misrata , urban warfare rages on and the death toll mounts . \nAcclaimed photojournalist and documentarian Tim Hetherington was among those killed this week . \nBefore he died , he sent a message on Twitter that echoed the pleas of desperate residents : `` In besieged Libyan city of Misrata . \nIndiscriminate shelling by Qaddafi forces . \nNo sign of NATO .

{"id": "102", "time": "2011-04-21", "text": "By James Lindsay -- Special to CNN Britain , France , and Italy took a step deeper into the Libyan civil war this week by announcing that they will send military advisers to aid the beleaguered rebels . \nThe decision grabbed headlines , but it won t do much to change the course of the fighting . \nBritish Foreign Secretary William Hague justified the decision to send military trainers by saying : As the scale of the humanitarian crisis has grown , so has urgency of increasing our efforts to defend civilians against attack from Gadhafi forces . \nWashington has applauded its allies decision , but it is not following suit . \nThe Obama administration is only offering the rebels $ 25 million in body armor , tents , uniforms , and other nonlethal equipment . \nThe British , French , and Italian decisions are a tacit admission that the prospects for ousting Muammar Gadhafi have dimmed . \nThe rebels have failed in their effort to retake key Libyan towns . \nMeanwhile , the situation in Misurata , Libya s third largest city , has grown increasingly grim as pro-Gadhafi forces continue to attack rebel positions . \nBut deciding to do something is not the same thing as deciding to do enough . \nThe British , French , and Italians are offering far less than the breathless news headlines suggest . \nThe number of advisers headed to Benghazi is small a maximum of twenty British advisers and perhaps ten or so French and Italian advisers . \nThese trainers will operate under strict limitations on what they can do . \nEven if NATO flooded Libya with military trainers the military balance on the ground would not change any time soon . \nCrack fighting forces aren t built over night . \nJust look at how long the United States has been at it trying to build the Afghan and Iraqi armies . \nAdvisers and assistance probably won t make a difference in the long run either . \nPro-Gadhafi forces are relatively well-armed and trained . \nThey also have good reason to continue fighting : the reasonable fear that they will lose their privileges if not their lives if the rebels prevail . \nSo the most likely outcome is that the fighting in Libya will drag on for months . \nWill the rising civilian death toll eventually spur NATO to send ground troops into Libya ? \nLibya is not Vietnam , where the introduction of a few military advisers in the late 1950s eventually grew into a commitment of half-a-million troops by the mid-1960s . \nAlthough Vice President Joe Biden insists that the traffic -LRB- at home -RRB- can bear politically more in Libya , the polls suggest otherwise . \nNeither Americans nor Europeans are eager to send their fellow citizens to fight , and possibly die , in Libya . \nThis highlights the fundamental strategic flaw in NATO s military operations . \nWashington , Paris , and London decided that Gadhafi must go , but they are unwilling to pay the cost to make that happen . \nLibyan civilians , precisely the people the NATO mission is supposed to protect , are paying the price for this strategic incoherence . \nThe views expressed in this article are solely those of James Lindsay . \nLike I said before , only a stupid , crazy , amoral fool would say the England , France and Italy have ant right to be in Libya at all . \nI say a Libya for the Libyans !!! April 21 , 2011 at 12:33 pm | Reply Nowhere has anyone said the opposite to what you 've proclaimed . \nYour one small voice is misinformed . \nThe west is responding from the experience of the past hundred years where leaders and dictators have trampled on the people . \nI agree that there could be a more effective roll out of plans to aid the rebels but then we 'll be condemned for our actions in the end anyway . \nPersonally ... I think the neighbouring Arab states that have recently thrown their dictators off their thrones should be assisting so if this goes from bad to worse ... it 'll be a family feud . \nFreedom from tyranny comes at a price financially and in lives . \nNobody said the streets of freedom were paved with gold . \nApril 22 , 2011 at 9:22 am | Reply Let the warring parties decide the outcome of the conflict , without third parties poking their nose into this business . \nWhoever prevails shall govern . \nHowever archaic it sounds , it is another human nature there . \nSo in order to save lives , get the civilians out first . \nApril 21 , 2011 at 12:56 pm | Reply What seems to never go mentioned , is that NATO is constrained by international law , not their `` incoherence '' or anything else . \nThat is , NATO has absolutely no right to assist the rebels in their military aims , nor assist in regime change . \nIf they go down this road , they know they will have spoiled the `` responsibility to protect '' -LRB- R2P -RRB- doctrine for ages . \nAll the ciricisms of the smaller -LRB- south -RRB- countries will have been justified . \nThey say that large Wetern countries would use R2P to actually achieve their strategic geo-political aims . \nThough NATO has already shown a willingness to exceed the UN mandate , making such disobedience obvious is not in the West 's interest . \nNATO has no business in this war , except to get rid of a throrn in the side of the West . \nBut that is not good enough under , if we truly believe in the rule of law . \nApril 21 , 2011 at 1:46 pm | Reply I guess `` strategic incoherence '' is a very politically correct way of saying NATO is bullying-around , making Libyan 's lives mireable so we can enjoy our Big-Macs and drive-around peacefully . \nWe threw a monkey-wrench to the arab revolution . \nApril 21 , 2011 at 1:51 pm | Reply Let 's face it . \nNATO and the UN are lost without the US . \nThey just ca n't function properly without the leadership or guidance of the US . \nWhy do I have this bad feeling that there will be a Libyan War added to Afghan and Iraq Wars . \nApril 21 , 2011 at 3:28 pm | Reply Quite right , George . \nAll these useless and unnecessary wars are American led . \nThis country needs both a new President and Congress who will not cater to the MIC -LRB- military-industrial-complex -RRB- as is currently the case . \nApril 21 , 2011 at 8:06 pm | Reply that 's their way even before ... what i 'm concern are the negative effect that were sown to the minds of the people of africa and the arab countries . \none reason why terrorism are becoming bigger . \nApril 21 , 2011 at 7:13 pm | Reply Now when some terrorists take out another embassy the US will be wondering why thay hate us for our freedoms . \nObama , just like the ideologue supreme executive that preceded him , is willing to destroy a country and kill millions if need be because HE decided HE wanted someone else to rule another country . \nThis war is an impeachable offense for which Congress should take action before the American people do . \nThe media is showing a picture of an injured child , yet this is only 1\\/100 ,000 th of the death cause by Bush s Shock and Awe campaign in Iraq . \nThe media never showed pictures of the limbless children from Bush s war of choice . \nDoes the media think Americans are that stupid and irrational that they can now get us to fight a war over what Bush did 100,000 times over ? \nThen the media tried to play on our sympathy for a dead reporter , but Bush intentionally attacked Al Jazeera and mudered a handful of reporters and not a peep was mentioned . \nNow we should be up in arms becasue one got too close to the fighting . \nWhen Bush had the Al Jazeera reporters killed , they gave their coordinated to the American military so they would not be attacked , and Bush used those coordinates specifically to attack them . \nThe rebels are a force of 1,500 . \nMany are al Qaeda . \nThey are not wearing uniforms and are placing civilians at risk by hiding behind civilians . \nThis is an international war crime as is hiding behind civilians and in population centers . \nWhy won t they move into the open and fight like an army ? \nThey are not an army , nor are they representative of the people . \nThey will never consolidate power without foreign occupation . \nThe rebels represent less than .005 % of the population . \nThe advisors ought to tell the rebels to flee . \nThat should be their advice . \nWar for regime change is an international war crime . \nDay of Rage in Washington D.C. on 6\\/30\\/11 Barack Obama needs to be indicted , tried in an international war crimes tribunal and dealt with appropriately . \nHe should spend the rest of his life in prison but unfortunately , he wo n't . \nQuite the contrary , he will end up living like a king back in Illinois if not in Hawaii . \nHow repulsive !!! April 22 , 2011 at 12:07 am | Reply @onesmallvoice : You go back and indict the Bush Empire and I 'll even consider slapping Obama on the wrist . \nAmerica just ca n't seem to do too much right when it comes to foreign policy . \nTerrible track record post WWII . \nMaybe it 's time to stay home . \nBut then that would just add to the number of unemployed ... war is good for the American economy and especially those who have invested in the various corporations of destruction . \nApril 22 , 2011 at 11:11 am | Reply You have done your research , but your argument falls apart when you reveal what Obama decided . \nHow do you have any way of knowing what someone else is thinking ? \nThe truth is , this Libyan revolution was not started by Obama . \nAlso , your numbers on the @l Q@ed@ involvement -- 1500 -- are a little bit too round for believability . \nThis whole argument about + err0r ! \ns + involvement in the Libyan revolution is false intelligence , and you ought to be smart enough to figure out why this false intelligence was planted , and who planted it . \nIt was planted by those who would rather see Arabs and Muslims kill off as many of each other as possible , and they want this more than they want to see genuine democracy in the Arab and Muslim world . \nApril 22 , 2011 at 5:12 pm | Reply I do n't know why or how NATO has the right interfering in another county 's internal affairs . \nDemanding that a president of another country stepped down and helping rebels . \nYa right , then why not do the same in other countries ? \nI do n't even want to get into the whole oil and gold thing ... And like U.S. did n't bomb Iraq and killed civilians there . \nNo one intervened to protect Iraqis and Bush did n't step down . \nThe government of Libya should be allowed to handle their own affair and put down the rebellion . \nGhadaffi obviously still has the support of Libyan army and most of the population . \nApril 21 , 2011 at 8:31 pm | Reply April 22 , 2011 at 12:10 am | Reply Thanks . \nI think Bush and his former cabinet should be tried for war crimes . \nApril 23 , 2011 at 1:38 am | What 's the difference here between Sierra Leone & Libya ?? Oil instead of Diamonds : -RRB- A war initiated by the west to buy cheap diamonds or oil in return for weapons : -RRB- I lost an older brother in Sierra Leone , slaughtered by the rebels . \nDoes anyone out there really believe the West really care about the Libyan people more than Gadaffi does ? \nHELL NO April 22 , 2011 at 9:51 am | Reply It is a fact that in the 1990 's , Sierra Leone made a request of the British Government -- that Britain make Sierra Leone a protectorate again ; essentially a territory of the UK . \nBritain refused the request very quickly Do you think that was a mistake ? \nApril 24 , 2011 at 1:29 am | Reply The incoherence is a direct result of all the money Khadafy has thrown at his propaganda machines all over the world , for years . \nBut now that the world is beginning to see through the smokescreen , the stalemate is over , and Khadafy is on his way out , whether he likes it or not . \nHe would be wise to shop for new real estate for himself , his family and his cronies , as far away from Libya as he can possibly get . \nIf he does n't make that his first order of business now , Khadafy will wind up prolonging this war for no reason at all , and finally he will be sharing a locker with Davy Jones . \nApril 22 , 2011 at 5:04 pm | Reply By the actions of Britain , it seem right if when the Irish uprise again , which seems evitable , then maybe one or a few countries could send in military advisers to the Irish Republic . \nHow about that Sir ! \nOr when the French have a pension revolt again or maybe a tax revolt , then advisors could be sent in to advise them on how to defeat the government . \nApril 22 , 2011 at 6:37 pm | Reply Good point yes , but why does not world understand the equation of ` MIGHT is RIGHT ' . \nMore than a dozen times since 1990s , MIGHT has caused severe MISERY to any nation that it did not like and at will . \nThat explains the double standards in global politics . \nApril 23 , 2011 at 6:07 pm | Pathetic Europeans . \nBush was right afterall ! \nAt least he had the galls and witherall to proceed with conviction instead of talking out of his ass as his successor has donE ! \nApril 23 , 2011 at 1:58 am | Reply It is the Libyan Rebels leadership who have cost the lives of fellow Libyans . \nIt was Libyan Rebels who decided they did not want external military on the ground and insisted on the Keystone cops option of arming untrained citizens with guns and specialized weapons and said go that way to fight an urban war . \nCompletely reckless attitude to fellow humanity -- which resulted in the although every brave and committed citizens running up and down hills firing over the top = not even cadet standard resulting in inevitable horrific casualties . \nAlso the Libyan Rebels position meant there was not ` on time ' coordination possible with NATO . \nThe deaths are attributable to the Libyan Rebel Leadership anyone who is aware war is not a video game knows this to be the case . \nThe fact is apart from the ridiculous Libyan Rebel military strategy the absence of Arab special services in significant or any numbers meant military engagements would bog down now we are seeing external military on the ground as predicted the nature of the war will change significantly with the inclusion of expertise and greater effective communication the life blood of effective combat outcomes . \nApril 23 , 2011 at 9:49 am | Reply It is the EVIL NATO that prolonged the war since March 21 onwards . \nGet EVILNESS out of the equation and Libyans will decide their future on their own . \nApril 23 , 2011 at 6:09 pm | Reply Obama has already said that Gadhafi must go and so he should . \nNATO is definitely lost without direct intervention of the USA . \nThe latter is THE EMPIRE - the richest and most powerful nation on this planet . \nNATO should at least send ground troops in . \nIt s too late to back down . \nIf so , the end results will be worse . \nApril 24 , 2011 at 7:40 pm | Reply Moammar Gadhafi is a despot , demented moron , and murderer - an international shame for the 21st century - and should be executed quickly by Libya s , or foreign , armed forces even for the sake of saving their skins if not solely to save Libyan lives , while at the same time taking over and installing a temporary military government that over a period of 2 years could bring things back to normal , including oil flows . \nNeedless to say , in the process , the armed forces there should be purged of any of Gadhafi s cronies so that the `` revolution '' continues to the benefit of the Libyan population . \nThe only political system that will last forever , so to speak , will be a western style-type democracy . \nApparently this truth has been realized by a whole new generation of Libyans educated within and outside of that country . \nThe internet has helped bridge the technological gap and to come to full realization that their young lives were meaningless and had no future with corrupt animals like Gadhafi , and his family , in power . \nHowever , Libyans will not have freedom and dignity for a long time . \nThey have to work at it , together with their armed forces that must see their role as only temporary - 2 years - until the country s new institutional basis is set up so that political parties can prosper in peace and without fear . \nOnce this is achieved , elections must be convened so that regional-party political representatives can be elected nationwide with a view to integrating a National Assembly to draft a new Constitution for the country . \nThis would be the beginning of a new future for the Libyan population . \nMeanwhile , if captured alive , the military government should prosecute Gadhafi so that the death penalty can be brought to bear on this god forsaken animal , and his family . \nHis own and family assets , in general , should be confiscated in Libya as well as outside of the country . \nThose monies belong to the people of Libya . \nBut more than anything , the world must congratulate the Libyan population for acting with great courage , with their hearts and minds , to try to topple a ruthless and corrupt regime from the face of the earth . \nNeedless to say many more countries will follow , not only in the Middle East mainly , Yemen , Saudi Arabia , Bahrain , Syria , Iran , etc. - but also in Latin America , especially in the case of those with presidential lunatics trying to emulate the Cuban political system which under the noses of the USA and the rest of the Americas has failed miserably , i.e. , Venezuela and his gorilla Chavez . \nIn general , the combination of authoritarian rule , high unemployment , poor opportunities for social advancement , demographic youth bulges , low public investment in education and health and other public services , and anger at high levels of corruption , and outright thievery , in the Middle East and North Africa , and in Latin America , will prompt public uprisings that will topple their leaders . \nChavez , Saleh , Bashar are definitely in this list after their close friend Gadhafi moves on to better pastures ! \nNeedless to say , the Cuban government also needs to be overthrown ! \nInstead , Presidents from these poor , backward economies , that have not even approached the take-off stage in economic development should instead concentrate their public administration efforts in fighting corruption , reducing the size of their inefficient and corrupt public sectors , and increasing public\\/private investments with the help of the multilateral financial community - including in the strategic social sectors ; i.e. , education , health , and basic services to increase employment . \nThe UN Security Council s mandate for NATO to intervene in Libya and\\/or declare a well enforced no-fly zone will stop the slaughter of innocent people and thousands of Libyans will not be assassinated without reason - except to want to live in democracy and in peace - by Gadhafi and his obedient and unscrupulous followers . \nMore than TEN THOUSAND LIBYANS HAVE ALREADY DIED in their fight for LIBERTY ! \nBy having provided military support , the West has started to make peace with the people of Libya ! \nWhile recognizing that imposing a no-fly zone is an act of war because it has required attacking Gaddafi 's air defense systems , not just anti-aircraft guns and missile batteries , but also radar and communications systems . \nNevertheless , this resolute and timely action must last for as long as it takes to overthrow him , even if rebel forces themselves fail to do so . \nAfterwards , Libya could be invaded with ground troops from Arab League Nations , mainly , and topple a weak , murderous , and corrupt regime that has only brought shame , blood , and tears to the Libyan people . \nWestern allies should not look for asylum for Gadhafi . \nHe should either be killed or captured to stand trial for crimes against humanity . \nApril 24 , 2011 at 7:43 pm | Reply NEW . . \n-- AUSTRALIAN FLOODS -LRB- Incl broken oil pipeline in US -RRB- -- BREAST FEEDING INSANITY PROTESTS -- WIKILEAKS is CIA -- HUMAN FLASH EATING MACHINE -- TRUTH BEHIND COLD WAR CURTAIN -- BROTHERHOOD OF MULTICULTURALISM AND SWINE\\/PIG FLUE SYNDROME -- TRUTH ABOUT FACEBOOK -LRB- Facebooth -RRB- -- PARLIAMENTARIANS or SICK BIPOLAR CRIMINAL DISTORTIONISTS -- NATIONALIST PARTIES OR HEAVILY LOADED WITH LIES SINKING WRECKS -- ESKIMO SARAH PALIN 'S `` BRIDGE TO NOWHERE '' -- NEWS\\/MEDIA OR SIMPLY BIG FAT VACUUM WORLD OF LIES\\/DEMENTIA !!? -- HEALTH CARE PLANE OR GENOCIDE BASED ON FORGIVE AND FORGET !!!? -- THE REAL DO N'T ASK DO N'T TELL , BUT DIE !!!

{"id": "333", "time": "2011-04-21", "text": "By the CNN Wire Staff NATO airstrikes heard in Tripoli Sound of jets , explosions heard in Tripoli U.S. Predator drones take flight in Libya Thousands have fled fighting in western Libya through the border crossing in Wazen A third chartered ship arrived in Benghazi , carrying bodies of two photojournalists killed in Misrata Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Large explosions and the sound of jets over Tripoli Thursday night indicated NATO has likely increased the intensity of its air strikes on Moammar Gadhafi 's key command and control military sites . \nCNN 's Fred Pleitgen , reporting from Libya , heard at least three major explosions . \nThe alliance has issued a new warning to Libyan civilians to stay away from military areas , foreshadowing plans for attacks on targets seen as strategically significant in stopping the government 's attacks against civilians , a NATO military official said Thursday . \nThe next phase will largely involve increased air strikes on key Gadhafi command , control and communications sites in and around Tripoli , although targets in other areas could be hit as well , said the official , who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter . \nLibyan official sorry journalists killed ` Slippery slope ' in Libya mission Zawiyah is a ghost town Veteran photojournalist killed in Libya NATO now has the use of armed U.S. Predator drones at its disposal . \nU.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates disclosed that the drones saw their first use in Libya Thursday , but poor weather forced them to return . \nUnmanned aerial vehicles offer more precise targeting , because their low-flying capability allows for better visibility , `` particularly on targets now that have started to dig themselves into defensive positions , '' Gates said . \nThe Predators bring `` capabilities to the NATO commander that they did n't have before , '' he said . \nPresident Barack Obama approved their use . \nRebels , who have complained that NATO was not being aggressive enough to protect civilians , said Thursday they had gained control of a key border crossing into Tunisia . \nThe crossing at Wazen , Libya , could prove key to access to the city of Nalut , under siege by Gadhafi 's forces for the past month . \nThousands have fled the fighting through Wazen to the nearby Tunisian town of Dehiba , where temporary camps have been set up for the displaced . \nThe Tunisian state-run news agency , TAP , also reported the rebel takeover of Wazen after early morning fighting . \nAbout 100 forces loyal to Gadhafi , including a high-ranking officer , fled across the border into Tunisia , said Mohammed Ali Abdallah , spokesman for National Front for the Salvation of Libya . \nHe said the rebels detained 14 members of Gadhafi 's forces . \nTAP reported that 13 Libyan officers have been detained by Tunisian military authorities . \nExplain it to me : Libya 's revolution Paris promises made to aid Libya rebels Will NATO jets sway fight for Misrata ? \nAlso Thursday , a third ship chartered by the International Organization for Migration made its way back from the besieged city of Misrata to the rebel stronghold of Benghazi in the east . \nMore than 1,000 rescued migrants were on board , as were the bodies of photojournalists Tim Hetherington and Chris Hondros , killed in Misrata on Wednesday , the organization said . \nThe ship also repatriated the body of an Ukrainian doctor . \nSeveral banners were displayed as the Ionian Spirit docked late Thursday in Benghazi . \nOne read : `` We feel for the families of the deceased , your blood was mixed with us in Misrata and with your loss you shared with us the price for freedom . '' \nAnother said , `` US and UK with your loss , you shared with us the price of freedom . '' \nHondros was American and Hetherington had dual British and U.S. citizenship . \nTwenty rebel fighters stood in military formation as the vessel arrived . \nThe reported rebel takeover Thursday of Wazen comes at a time when many are questioning whether a military victory over Gadhafi is possible . \nFrance and Italy announced Wednesday that they will send military officers to Libya to advise the rebels . \nAfter a similar announcement by the British government Tuesday , French government spokesman Francois Baroin said a `` small number '' of French troops was being sent to advise the rebels ' Transitional National Council . \nFrench Defense Minister Gerard Longuet has ruled out sending ground troops to fight alongside the rebels . \n`` This is a real issue that deserves an international debate , '' he said , adding , `` We are working within the framework of the 1973 resolution , '' a reference to the U.N. resolution that authorized action in Libya . \n`` You can not please everyone all the time , '' he said . \nItaly will send military advisers to train the rebels in self-defense tactics , Italian Foreign Ministry spokesman Maurizio Massari announced . \nBritain said its contingent of military officers will be sent to Benghazi to serve in an advisory role . \nThe team will work with the Transitional National Council to help the opposition improve its military organizational structures , communications and logistics , the British Foreign Office said . \nIt will also help deliver aid . \nU.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Wednesday she has recommended that Obama authorize the U.S. government to send up to $ 25 million in non-lethal commodities and services to support Libyan rebels , including the Transitional National Council . \nOn Thursday , Clinton urged more patience from critics of the anti-Gadhafi campaign , noting that `` it is always a temptation in any conflict to -LRB- want -RRB- a resolution quickly .

'' \nHe praised the Libyan standard of living as one that others in the world envy and called on his countrymen to defend it . \n`` They want to take your petrol , '' he said . \n`` This is what America , this is what the French , those colonialists , want . '' \nHe cited people from Pakistan , Afghanistan and Algeria as among those who have joined the rebel forces -- `` hunting children who are not mature , who have certain deficiencies ; they offer them pills . \nThis is what we understood so far . '' \nHe called anti-government forces in Benghazi , a rebel-held town in the east , `` traitors '' and predicted that the pro-Gadhafi residents `` are going to throw them out . '' \nIn Gadhafi 's stronghold , the capital city of Tripoli , about 100 journalists assembled during the evening in the lobby of a hotel after being told that Gadhafi would arrive . \nNine hours later , just before midnight , his convoy of SUVs pulled up to the hotel . \nGadhafi talks communism and Al Qaeda Shortly afterward , surrounded by his security detail , he strode into the lobby , waved at the throng of reporters , pumped his right fist several times into the air , retreated to a private room for an interview with a Turkish journalist , then left via a back door without addressing the reporters . \nThe interview was to air Wednesday morning . \nThe incident occurred hours after opposition members denied Tuesday that they have been negotiating an exit deal with Gadhafi , rejecting an assertion made earlier in the day by an opposition official . \nGadhafi 's regime , too , denied having entered into negotiations with the rebels . \nMusa Ibrahim , a government spokesman , called reports of such negotiations `` lies . '' \nThe Libyan opposition is composed not of a single monolithic group , but of various groups and individuals around the country whose shared goal is to see the 68-year-old ruler ousted . \nBut their military skills tend to be rudimentary , at best , when compared with the relatively disciplined , well-armed pro-Gadhafi forces . \n`` There is no one here with military experience , but have a strong heart , '' said medical student Yahya Ali , who was manning an antiaircraft battery in the eastern Libyan town of Al-Brega after four hours of training . \nIn Washington , U.S. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said any departure from Libya of Gadhafi would not exempt him , his family or others from responsibility for their actions . \n`` We are going to hold him accountable , '' Crowley said . \nU.S. President Barack Obama discussed Libya on Tuesday with British Prime Minister David Cameron , the White House said in a statement . \n`` They agreed that the common objective in Libya must be an immediate end to brutality and violence ; the departure of Gadhafi from power as quickly as possible ; and a transition that meets the Libyan peoples ' aspirations for freedom , dignity , and a representative government , '' it said . \nBoth leaders agreed to go ahead with planning responses , `` including surveillance , humanitarian assistance , enforcement of the arms embargo , and a no-fly zone . '' \nDeath toll estimates have ranged from more than 1,000 to as many as 2,000 . \n`` Both the Libyan government and opposition forces need to allow unhindered access for aid organizations to assist civilians , '' Bill Frelick , refugee program director at Human Rights Watch , said Tuesday . \n`` People living in areas of heavy fighting in western Libya are now in dire need of medical aid and other assistance . '' \nThe U.N. World Food Programme said Tuesday a convoy of trucks entered Libya headed for Benghazi , the rebel stronghold in eastern Libya . \n`` A convoy of trucks carrying 70 metric tons of high-energy , fortified date bars crossed the Egyptian border last night on its way to Benghazi . \nThis would be the first delivery of food assistance from a U.N. agency to enter the country , '' the organization said in a statement . \nPlans for more food deliveries are being made , and tons of food have been delivered to the Egyptian border to help feed refugees , the organization said . \nThis is part of a $ 39.2 million emergency operation designed to help feed more than 1 million people in Libya , Egypt and Tunisia over three months , the group said . \nLate Monday , the Gulf Cooperation Council said Libya had rejected its offer of humanitarian aid . \nThe council is composed of Bahrain , Kuwait , Oman , Qatar , Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates . \nAs reports continue to emerge of the government 's use of force against civilians , the international community has been left pondering strategies on how to end the violence . \nThree members of the U.N. Security Council -- France , Britain and the United States -- were working Monday on a possible resolution that would include language on a no-fly zone over Libya , diplomatic sources at the United Nations said . \nAnd the Gulf Cooperation Council said Monday night they supported such an action . \nThe Organization of the Islamic Conference , which represents 56 member states , said Tuesday that it wants the United Nations to enforce a no-fly zone over Libya . \nBut any kind of military intervention could face sharp criticism from Russia and China , two permanent members of the council that wield veto power . \nLibyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khalid Karim told CNN on Tuesday that Libya is not misusing its air force and that any no-fly zone would be tantamount to an act of war . \nHe said the Libyan government has asked for international monitors to verify that assertion . \nHe said the military `` are taking purely defensive positions ; they are not taking offensive ones '' except in self-defense . \nThe U.S. administration remains reluctant to move forward on a no-fly zone alone . \n`` Well , we want to see the international community support it , '' Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told Sky News on Tuesday . \nAnd the United States has also been reluctant to consider using force alone . \n`` We 'd like to see this resolved peacefully , '' Clinton said . \n`` We 'd like to see him go peacefully . \nWe would like to see a new government come peacefully . \nBut if that 's not possible , then we 're going to work with the international community . '' \nAsked if the United States was considering lifting the arms embargo , she said , `` Well , I think everything is being looked at , but it is difficult in the midst of this civil conflict that is going on now to even know how you would do that , because right now , it 's not clear what part of the country is actually under rebel control . '' \nThe U.S. ambassador to Libya , Gene Cretz , has met in Rome and Cairo with Libyan opposition figures to get a sense of what is happening in the country , Crowley of the State Department said . \nHe did not give names . \nCrowley said there have been meetings and phone conversations with members of the National Transitional Council and others . \nThe State Department also spoke Friday with Libyan Foreign Minister Musa Kusa in a brief conversation in which each side gave its view , Crowley said . \nNATO said it has begun round-the-clock surveillance flights near Libya . \nWith no clear end to the clashes in sight , U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon appointed a new special envoy to Libya to discuss the crisis with officials in Tripoli . \nThe fighting has sparked the flight of Libyans and foreigners out of Libya , with nations across the globe scrambling to help people leave . \nAbout 200,000 people have fled Libya with nearly equal numbers going to Tunisia and Egypt , the U.N. refugee agency has said . \nBut 15,000 to 17,000 people are still at a refugee camp near the Libya-Tunisia border . \nMost of them are from Bangladesh , the U.N. refugee agency said . \nA man who said he was trapped in Misrata , a city east of Tripoli that has seen heavy clashes , said the rebels were running out of weapons -- but will continue to fight . \n`` Maybe tomorrow I 'll still be alive , I do n't know . \nI have nothing to lose , '' the man said . \n`` Nobody believes he will be alive tomorrow . \nWe need support .

{"id": "110", "time": "2011-03-09", "text": "By Dr. James Lindsay , Special to CNN Hopes that revolutionary fervor would quickly sweep Moammar Gadhafi from power look to be dashed . \nThe Libyan strongman has secured his hold over Tripoli , the country s capital and largest city , and his forces have begun attacking rebel strongholds . \nA protracted Libyan civil war may be looming . \nThat prospect presents President Obama with a dilemma : How does he encourage Gadhafi 's ouster and minimize harm to Libyan civilians without entangling the United States in yet another Middle East conflict ? \nHe has seven options . \nThe administration has already taken several steps to pressure Gadhafi to go . \nIt has frozen $ 30 billion worth of Libyan assets in the United States , joined with the rest of the international community in banning members of the regime from traveling internationally and voted to suspend Libya s membership in the UN Human Rights Council . \nNone of these measures is likely to make a difference , at least any time soon . \nThe travel ban and Human Rights Council suspension are purely symbolic . \nSanctions could take months to pinch the regime , if at all . \nSo what are the White House s next steps ? \nDirect U.S. military intervention is off the table . \nSecretary of Defense Robert Gates and senior U.S. military officials oppose sending U.S. troops into Libya . \nThe American public feels likewise . \nHere is a figure to keep in mind : a majority of Americans -- 58 percent according to the latest CNN poll -- oppose the war in Afghanistan . \nAmericans don t want to get out of Afghanistan just so we can go into Libya . \nSo what might the administration do instead ? \nHere are the seven possibilities : 1 -RRB- Impose a no-fly zone . \nThis is what the U.S. did over parts of Iraq for more than a decade after the 1991 Gulf War . \nWe could also go beyond that and bomb airport runways so they are unusable . \nNeither of these steps would help the rebels much . \nThe Libyan Air Force has been a non-factor in the fighting so far . \nA no-fly zone and cratered runways also would not help the rebels deal with the real threat they face , namely , artillery and multiple launch rocket systems -LRB- MLRS -RRB- . \nThese advanced weapons are capable of leveling entire neighborhoods . \n2 -RRB- Impose a no-drive zone . \nThe White House could tackle the artillery and MLRS threat by bombing these and other heavy weapons . \nThat , however , clearly makes the United States a participant in Libya s civil war . \nA no-drive zone would also be ineffective if Gadhafi 's forces have already dispersed their heavy weapons into cities and towns . \nAttacking them in place runs a high risk of killing and injuring civilians . \n3 -RRB- Push someone else to intervene in Libya . \nBut who would volunteer ? \nEuropean countries don t want to re-assume the colonial mantle . \nMost of Libya s neighbors either lack the ability or desire to take on a peacemaking mission . \nCountries outside the region would prefer to worry about their own problems . \n4 -RRB- Directly arm the rebels . \nThis policy is gaining support on Capitol Hill . \nBut it may merely increase the carnage rather than give the rebels the upper hand . \nSophisticated weapons require training to use , but no one is talking about sending in trainers . \nEqually troubling , the weapons we want Libyans to use against Gadhafi could wind up in the wrong hands and be used against us down the road . \nWhat succeeds Gadhafi 's regime may not be a stable , broad-based government but something that looks more like Somalia . \n5 -RRB- Ask other countries to arm the rebels . \nUnfortunately , that doesn t solve the problem of weapons ending up in the wrong hands . \nWould the Saudis , for instance , be careful to make sure that weapons don t fall in to the hands of Islamic extremists who are as mad at the West as they are at Gadhafi ? \n6 -RRB- Provide tactical military intelligence to the rebels . \nReal-time information about the regime s troops movements would help the rebels direct their own forces . \nBut it would not be a game changer . \n7 -RRB- Provide the rebels with moral and humanitarian support but nothing else . \nDebates in Washington always presume that the White House has to do something . \nBut it can choose to do nothing . \nThat sounds cold-hearted , especially when cable news , YouTube , and Twitter will bring the fighting into our living rooms . \nBut the United States has stood on the sidelines many times before when people struggled to overthrow a tyrant . \nMoral outrage can give way to calculations of self-interest or political expediency . \nNone of these options is appealing . \nThat is why inside the White House officials are no doubt hoping that events will save them from having to choose among them . \nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of James Lindsay . \nWe dont get involved . \nSince out money went to china , tell them to do it . \nMarch 9 , 2011 at 10:05 am | Reply I agree totally China is killing the North American Economy IMO , so why dont thye contribute !!!

March 9 , 2011 at 11:18 am | Reply I have to agree . \nFor all of the talk about deficit reduction , we are still in Iraq - for what again ? \nWe created that conflict on credit we did n't have and the same deficit busters are busting at the seams because Obama is not reacting like the last cowboy who got us unto a useless war that taxpayers continue to pay for . \nWe do n't need another one without deep thought and consideration about what the heck we 're doing . \nMarch 9 , 2011 at 11:46 am | `` Doing nothing '' is not a zero cost option . \nOne simple word , like it or not -- OIL . \nProtracted instability in or bordering any oil producing nation will have a negative effect on the US economy . \nIt does n't matter that we do n't get much oil from Libya , since oil is a standard , globally traded commodity -- any reduction in suplly reliability affects the global market . \nWe have oil prices in the $ 100.00 per barrel range now , in a global recession -- what do you think oil prices would be if the US economy was strong -- driving demand in China and elsewhere , in addition to increased domestic consumption . \nRising oil prices , if sustained , will put the brakes on any economic recovery in the US . \nLibya is not an isolated situation , either -- the Egyptian military and security forces are no doubt watching the situation closely , to see how far they really have to go with reform -- if Qaddafi is successful , that will have a demoralizing effect on Egypt 's opposition , and the Egyptian military and security apparatus will likely just pick another front man and continue much of the Mubarak era status quo . \nIf Qaddafi falls , then opposition movements throughout the arab world will be energized and more insistent on reform or regime change . \nThe beneficial end result for the US is not going to come from US bought thugs like Mubarak -LRB- our friend so long as we fed his regime billions in aid -RRB- , but from the emergence of stable governments and domestic economic growth in the arab world . \nWe would not even be discussing options with respect to Libya if the results did not have major geopolicital and global economic significance for the US . \nBloodshed and butchery have occurred in the Congo and Darfur for years , and we 've never considered intervention . \nPolitical oppression is rampant throughout the world , and the US does n't consider intervention . \nThis `` policeman of the world '' concept is self-deluding propaganda . \nWe have never endeavored to be the world 's `` policeman '' -- US foreign policy and foreign military or intelligence interventions have always been guided by an intent to protect or enhance US economic interests . \nLibya is no different in that regard , and we have a clear economic interest . \nJust ask any yuppie commodities trader working at NYMEX . \nMarch 9 , 2011 at 1:42 pm | Actually , we do n't get ANY oil from Libya . \nThe prices have n't gone up in America because the world market has been drastically effected at this point . \nThe prices have gone up because greedy assholes fear in advance that they will . \nOn top of that , what is this crap about Obama contemplating using our reserves to offset prices in America ? \nThe American oil market income and consumption has not changed . \nHe should penalize the companies who are raising the prices for no reason and DEMAND the price go back down but , Obama ai n't really doing shit about nothing . \nOUR GOVERNMENT IS FUCKING USELESS . \nTEAR IT ALL DOWN ! \nMarch 9 , 2011 at 2:13 pm | You have the most informed analysis of the situation . \nThe article itself has nothing to offer . \nWe can not afford another war and even if we were to get involve , it will give the Al Quada and other of their ilk will exploit that . \nOne way to help this could be by recognizing the rebel government as representing the new Libya . \nThis will allow the recognized government to request weaponary and humanitarian assistance . \nWe have already burned out bridges with Ghaddafi and recognizing the new government would not effect the future . \nMarch 9 , 2011 at 2:50 pm | # 7 . \nWe are presently doing what we should be doing . \nWe are helping people to go back to their homes . \nWe should do NOTHING militarily !!!!

Moammar Gadhafi . \nThe U.S. and its allies have imposed a no-fly zone over Libya . \nCritics ask why U.S. military power has been used in Libya but not Syria Violence in Libya broke out before violence in Syria , one analyst notes International consensus on military action exists in Libya , but not in Syria , analysts say Assad has more friends and allies than Gadhafi -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Two countries , two cases of extreme violence committed against citizens by their own government . \nIn one case , the Obama administration responds with military force . \nIn the other , it does n't . \nThe question has been raised in response to the radically different U.S. reactions to the bloodshed in Libya and Syria . \nMore than 400 people have been killed in Syria over the past several weeks as Damascus has cracked down on protesters seeking reform , according to the Syrian Human Rights Information Link , a prominent human rights group . \nThe United Nations says it has information that 76 people were killed in that country last Friday alone , apparently during peaceful marches . \nPresident Bashar al-Assad 's regime has described the protesters as `` armed criminal groups , '' and shows no sign of letting up . \nPresident Barack Obama has condemned the violence `` in the strongest possible terms '' and is seeking ways to `` increase the pressure on the regime ... in a targeted way , '' according to White House Press Secretary Jay Carney . \nSo far , however , the response has amounted to little more than talk . \nOver in Libya , however , the U.S. reaction was entirely different when strongman Moammar Gadhafi promised to show `` no mercy '' to residents of the rebel-held city of Benghazi . \nWashington worked furiously behind the scenes at the United Nations to win an international mandate for a naval blockade , a no-fly zone and a license to take military action to protect civilians . \nObama promised no use of ground troops , but U.S. air power was used to devastating effect against elements of Gadhafi 's forces before control of the operation was handed over to NATO commanders . \nThe White House says the two situations ca n't be compared . \nWhy Syria different than Libya for U.S. Syrian protests spread despite violence Reporter in Misrata : ` We 're under siege ' Libya was `` a unique situation , '' Carney told reporters Monday . \n`` We had large portions of the country that were out of the control of Moammar Gadhafi -LRB- and -RRB- we had an international consensus to act . \nWe had the support of the Arab League to act in a multilateral fashion . '' \nBut Washington is `` pursuing a range of possible policy options '' in Syria , he stressed . \nThe administration is looking at `` targeted sanctions to respond to the crackdown ... and to make clear that this behavior is unacceptable . '' \nAmerican `` values and principles apply to all countries , '' Defense Secretary Robert Gates added Tuesday . \n`` Our response in each country will have to be tailored to that country , and the circumstances peculiar to that country . '' \nPart of the reason the Obama administration intervened militarily in Libya and not Syria is because `` Libya happened first , '' noted Danielle Pletka , vice president for foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute , a conservative Washington think tank . \n`` So the international community responded there first . '' \nProtests in Benghazi first broke out in mid-February . \nProtests in the Syrian city of Daraa started last month after a violent crackdown by security forces on peaceful demonstrators protesting the arrests of youths who scribbled anti-government graffiti . \nSecond , there is `` nowhere near the consensus on Syria as there is on Libya , '' Pletka told CNN . \nSyria , as opposed to Libya , stands at the heart of the Arab world . \nAssad has more friends and allies to call on . \n`` Assad is a dictator , a sponsor of terrorism , -LRB- and -RRB- a thug , '' Pletka said . \n`` You could argue he 's worse than Gadhafi . '' \nBut `` on Syria , the Arab League is not going to be nearly as forward-leaning . \n-LRB- They 're -RRB- much closer to Assad . '' \nAmong other things , Gadhafi has been accused of trying to have then-Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah assassinated in 2003 . \nThere 's a `` personal antipathy '' factor between Gadhafi and other Arab leaders , Pletka said . \nAt the same time , Israel may have a hostile relationship with its neighbor , but the Israeli leadership is `` very comfortable with the devil it knows '' in Damascus . \nObama , Pletka said , has shown an extreme reluctance to engage in unilateral military action . \nOusting Assad would change the entire political dynamic in the Middle East to the benefit of the United States , she said , noting Syria 's close ties to Iran and organizations such as Hezbollah , Hamas and Islamic Jihad . \nBut unless and until a firmer international consensus emerges , more concerted action is unlikely . \nMilitary action in Libya may also have became a priority partly due to fears of al Qaeda , according to Rick Nelson , a terrorism expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies , another Washington think tank . \nAl Qaeda is `` good at using countries in chaos to carve out safe havens , '' Nelson said , noting that the second-highest number of foreign fighters for al Qaeda in Iraq came from Libya . \nAs Libya became more unstable , it may have become a priority for Western powers to ensure the country does n't become more of a home for al Qaeda leaders . \nNelson echoed Pletka 's point about the lack of an international consensus on Syria . \n`` People do n't want to be on Assad 's bad side , '' he said . \nIf you attack Syria , `` you 're crossing a line that is changing the whole strategic calculus in the region in one move , '' he said . \n`` The stakes are a lot higher .

'' \n`` It has been very hard the past few days because the freedom forces have been facing heavy tanks and artillery weapons with very light weapons , '' the spokesman said . \nWhile some members of the Libyan military reportedly defected to join the opposition , the rebels include many volunteers who have not been trained . \nOver the weekend , CNN reported that rebels had taken al-Brega , Ras Lanuf and Bin Jawad , and reached a town just east of Sirte . \nBut in the past three days , opposition fighters have been pushed back eastward . \nCNN 's Ben Wedeman , reporting Thursday from near al-Brega , said the rebels , armed with light mortars and machine guns , have displayed no strategy in their running battles with loyalist troops . \nGates reiterated the Obama administration 's promise that no U.S. ground forces will be used in Libya , telling committee members that the rebels had indicated they did n't want such an intervention . \nBut the United States does have CIA personnel on the ground . \nA U.S. intelligence source said the CIA is operating in the country to help increase U.S. `` military and political understanding '' of the situation . \nA former counterterrorism official with knowledge of U.S. Libya policy said there is a presidential finding authorizing the CIA to conduct operations in support of U.S. policy in Libya , including assessing the opposition and determining their needs . \nSpecific activities by CIA officers will be determined by conditions on the ground and would need further approval from the White House , the source said . \nA former senior intelligence official said officers `` might be advising -LRB- rebels -RRB- on how to target the adversary , how to use the weapons they have , reconnaissance and counter-surveillance . '' \nPresidential findings are a type of secret order authorizing some covert intelligence operations . \nThe CIA has had a presence in Libya for some time , a U.S. official told CNN earlier this month . \n`` The intelligence community is aggressively pursuing information on the ground , '' the official said . \nThe CIA sent additional personnel to Libya to augment officers on the ground after the anti-government protests erupted , the official said , without giving details . \nCIA officers assisted with the rescue of one of two U.S. airmen whose fighter jet crashed in Libya on March 21 , a knowledgeable U.S. source said . \nNATO emphasized Thursday that the U.N. resolution authorizing action in Libya precludes `` occupation forces . '' \nNATO Adm. Giampaolo Di Paola , chairman of the NATO Military Committee , indicated that the presence of foreign intelligence personnel does not violate U.N. Security Council 1973 , which authorized action in Libya . \nRebel forces have been demanding an end to Gadhafi 's nearly 42 years of rule in Libya . \nThey have faced sustained attacks by a regime fighting to stay in power and portraying the opposition as terrorists backed by al Qaeda . \nRebel forces have lost Bin Jawad and the key oil town of Ras Lanuf and are backed up to the al-Brega area , Bani said Wednesday . \nAjdabiya , which is east of al-Brega , will be prepared as a `` defense point '' if the withdrawal continues farther east , he said . \nAmid the setbacks faced by rebels , a significant crack in Gadhafi 's armor surfaced when Libyan Foreign Minister Moussa Koussa fled to London on Wednesday and told the government there that he has resigned , the British Foreign Office said . \nKoussa -- a former head of Libyan intelligence -- was a stalwart defender of the government as recently as a month ago . \nBut in recent weeks his demeanor had visibly changed . \nAt one recent media briefing , he kept his head down as he read a statement and left early . \nBritish Foreign Secretary William Hague said Koussa had not been offered any immunity . \nKoussa 's defection provides evidence `` that Gadhafi 's regime ... is fragmented , under pressure and crumbling from within , '' said Hague , adding that Koussa is voluntarily speaking with officials in the United Kingdom . \nLibyan government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim said Thursday that Koussa did not tell the government he planned to resign before he flew to Britain . \nIbrahim said Koussa asked for sick leave and the government gave him permission to leave the country and receive intensive medical care . \nThe government had another setback Thursday , with news that an official who was picked as Libyan ambassador to the United Nations has defected . \nA relative and an opposition leader said Thursday that former Foreign Minister Ali Abdussalam Treki was in Cairo . \nCNN 's Nic Robertson , Ben Wedeman , Reza Sayah , Dana Bash , Pam Benson , Tim Lister and Zain Verjee contributed to this report . \n"}
{"id": "326", "time": "2011-03-31", "text": "March 31 , 2011 | By Fawaz A. Gerges , Special to CNN Almost two weeks of intense bombings and the enforcement of a no-fly zone in Libya by Western-led forces have neither broken the will of Col. Moammar Gadhafi nor subdued his followers . \nInstead , the past couple of weeks have proved that Libya is much more divided than the world had feared . \nThe major challenge facing the opposition now will be in reaching out to tribal supporters of Gadhafi -- and skeptics and bystanders -- to allay their fears . \nThis kind of reconciliation will be the only means to avert a protracted , costly civil war that could allow Gadhafi to regain some degree of control . \nThe coalition 's airstrikes have indeed severely degraded Gadhafi 's military infrastructure and paved the way for the rebels to recapture , at least for a time , a number of coastal communities and important oil installations , including Ras Lanuf , Brega and Bin Jawad . \nBut loyalist forces pushed them out in recent days -LRB- Ajdabiya and Uqayla still appear to be in rebel hands at the moment -RRB- . \nAccording to Pentagon spokesman Vice Adm. Bill Gortney , any military gains made by the rebels will be tenuous because of their lack of organizational structure . \nTwo high-level Libyan officials , Foreign Minister Moussa Koussa and Ali Abdussalam el-Treki , did defect this week . \nDespite this , Gadhafi 's entourage is fiercely defending the cities and towns recaptured from the rebels . \nThat they continue to persevere in the face of international force should not come as a surprise , given the tribal structure of Libyan society and Gadhafi 's manipulation and co-opting of tribal divisions and allies . \nWhat is even more alarming is that Gadhafi 's forces have managed to insert themselves into urban areas across Libya . \nTo defeat these loyalists will necessitate boots on the ground fighting a long , bloody , guerrilla-style war . \nCivilians would undoubtedly become targets . \nEven if the Western-led coalition arms and trains the rebels and dislodges Gadhafi from power , the morning after will likely be messy , costly and even less certain . \nLibya appears to be sliding into a prolonged conflict with no light at the end of the tunnel . \n"}
{"id": "394", "time": "2011-03-31", "text": "By Alexis Crow , Special to CNN Arming rebel force carries with it clear moral predicament in facilitating the act of killing U.S. has reputation for propping up unsavory dictators while arming opposition groups The longer conflict continues , the longer the country can be used as launch-pad for opportunists Dr. Alexis Crow is Research Fellow at Chatham House 's International Security Programme . \n-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As the Western coalition considers the option of whether or not to arm the rebel opposition in Libya , one word immediately comes to mind : `` Blowback . '' \nCoined by author Chalmers Johnson , it is now often referred to specifically as the unintended consequence of the U.S. decision to arm the non-Afghan Arab fighters -- or ` mujahideen ' -- in their fight against the Soviets . \nLittle did the CIA know that the very same fighters would one day form the backbone of al Qaeda . \nYet in contrast to `` Charlie Wilson 's War '' in Afghanistan , and indeed other CIA missions throughout the Cold War -- particularly in Latin America -- the current decision is being debated in the open . \nOn whether or not to arm the rebels , President Obama announced : `` I 'm not ruling it out but I 'm also not ruling it in . '' \nWhy such a cautious tone ? \nPrimarily , arming a rebel force carries with it a clear moral predicament in facilitating the act of killing . \nThis is something to be carefully debated by all of the Libya coalition partners . \nFurthermore , since the start of the Cold War , the U.S. has garnered quite a tarnished reputation for propping up unsavory dictators on the one hand , and giving arms and materiel to opposition groups , on the other . \nNotwithstanding , since the start of the intervention , the U.S. and its allies have had to seriously consider the option of arming the Libyan opposition , in the event that the conflict becomes a stalemate between a loosely-organized rebel group and Gadhafi 's well-equipped loyalist forces . \nBut the resounding questions are : Who are the rebels , and do they represent a coherent democratic alternative to Gadhafi 's regime ? \nOr , will arming the opposition fuel a tribal conflict ? \nA case could be made that Gadhafi 's autocratic rule is comparable to that of Marshal Tito in the Balkans : Only a dictator could hold different tribes or nationalities in place in one political entity . \nWhen Gadhafi came to power by military force in 1969 , he united three separate territories , divided by the former king Idriss I -- hence , the argument goes , a representative democracy could n't hold them together again . \nHowever , there are reports of a considerable population of the Warfalla and Tarhuna tribes -- those loyal to the Gadhafi regime -- residing in the east of the country , as well as many Benghazis living in the west . \nIf they form some sort of united front against Gadhafi and in the name of democracy -- spearheaded by the rebels -- there may be hope for change . \nYet how quickly could a new government become stabilized -- especially in a region rocked by Islamist revolt ? \nHow long might that government stay in power ? \nWith hindsight , what national interest might justify supplying arms to rebels in a volatile and unstable region ? \nThe longer an armed conflict continues , the longer the country can be used as a launch-pad for opportunists seeking to wield non-state power , and accordingly , the more time afforded for such groups to raid arms depots or caches potentially provided by the West . \nAfter all , the Kalashnikovs and M-16s used during the Soviet war in Afghanistan have remained serviceable for decades -- and are even employed against ISAF forces today . \nLooking back to CIA 's support of the mujahideen , `` Charlie Wilson 's War '' was somehow justified by the national interest of containing the Soviets -- by ensuring their military defeat in south Asia , we might have hastened their ideological defeat in Europe . \nYet with hindsight , what national interest might justify supplying arms to rebels in a volatile and unstable region , populated by spin-off groups from the al Qaeda franchise , ready to capitalize on a potential civil war ? \nIn what way can this befit any national security interest of a coalition partner ? \nTherefore , even more than the moral dilemma of giving arms to groups , the option at hand may pose a greater strategic dilemma , with unintended consequences for decades to come . \nThese questions merit serious consideration in the coming days -- before any option is `` ruled in .

Bakshi , CNN Chris Strohm over at the National Journal lays out five reasons to arm Libya s rebels , and another five reasons not to . \nFive reasons for arming the rebels include : -LRB- 1 -RRB- it may level the playing field ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- the UN Resolution authorizes all necessary measures ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- it may stymie al-Qaeda ; -LRB- 4 -RRB- regional stability is at stake ; and -LRB- 5 -RRB- other countries can provide the arms . \nFive reasons against arming the rebels include : -LRB- 1 -RRB- we don t know who they are ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- it may not be needed ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- it may not be legal ; -LRB- 4 -RRB- it may stir up a hornet s nest ; and -LRB- 5 -RRB- it may cost too much . \nBelow I ve highlighted a few takes from people on both sides of the debate , and their reasons . \nFareed argues that arming the opposition is a low-cost policy with a high rate of success , necessary for leveling the playing field against Gadhafi . \nOver the past five decades , the U.S. has had very mixed results when it has intervened , by air or land , in other people 's wars . \nBut it has done pretty well when it has helped one side of the struggle . \nArming rebels in Afghanistan , Central America and Africa has proved to be a relatively low-cost policy with high rates of success . \nGiving arms , food , logistical help , intelligence and other such tools to the Libyan opposition would boost its strength and give it staying power . \nOnce Gadhafi realizes that he is up against an endless supply of arms and ammunition , he will surely recalibrate his decisions . \nFareed further argues that a genuine rebel army could pressure Gadhafi toward some kind of exit : Now that we have tied ourselves to their -LRB- the Libyan rebels -RRB- fate , we certainly need to help them more substantially . \nThe arms embargo , which applies equally to Gadhafi and the opposition , will have to be circumvented . \nA genuine rebel army would put further pressure on Gadhafi , who would know that he faced death at its hands , and would push him toward some kind of exit . \nMax Boot adopts a more aggressive stance , saying the U.S. end goal ought to be removing Gadhafi from power , and arming the rebels is a vital step in that direction . \nGiven that we already have Western agents on the ground helping them -LRB- the rebels -RRB- , and that Western aircraft are actively bombing Gadhafi s forces to bring about his defeat , it seems disingenuous to claim we are not involved in regime change . \nThe only question now is whether that regime change will be swift or protracted . \nI believe it is in our interest to do everything possible to bring about Gadhafi s downfall as rapidly as possible and then to help Libya stabilize itself in the aftermath . \nThe lesson Max draws from Afghanistan in the 1980s is : If the U.S. is involved in toppling a regime , whether directly or indirectly , we must not walk away afterwards . \nOtherwise our aid can backfire . \nNow according to Reuters and the New York Times , President Obama has signed a secret finding authorizing the C.I.A. to provide arms and other support to the Libyan rebels , although reportedly debate continues within the administration on whether to actually follow through on arming the rebels : Several weeks ago , President Obama signed a secret finding authorizing the C.I.A. to provide arms and other support to Libyan rebels , American officials said Wednesday . \nBut weapons have not yet been shipped into Libya , as Obama administration officials debate the effects of giving them to the rebel groups . \nThe presidential finding was first reported by Reuters . \nBlogger Andrew Sullivan is outraged that President Obama may get the U.S. involved in regime change in secret : To say that this is a betrayal of his candidacy and his supporters would be an understatement . \nIt makes George Bush 's request for a vote from Congress before committing the US to war in Iraq look like a model of democratic accountability . \nHow dare this president commit this country to an open-ended involvement in a foreign country 's civil war - in secret , with no real public debate and then presented as a fait accompli . \nAnd now we are told there is a debate within the administration over whether to follow through on its preparation and actually arm the rebels . \nHow can that be possible ? \nIf we are not there for regime change imposed by foreign powers , as the president has insisted , on what grounds is this even being discussed ? \nAndrew further argues that arming the rebels would undermine the Arab Spring : This secret shift to full-on entanglement is also , to my mind , a well-meant but ill-conceived undermining of the Arab Spring . \nRegime change by force of foreign arms is not a democratic revolution ; it is the imposition by foreign powers of their agenda in the service of groups we do not know or understand -- and will never know and never fully understand . \nBruce Riedel warns of a slippery slope : You can t just give them weapons . \nThey need to be organized and disciplined to go from being an armed mob to a force capable of dealing with Gadhafi s troops . \nThat means sending trainers and advisers , which means putting boots on the ground . \nAlexis Crow echoes common concerns about the makeup of the rebels : But the resounding questions are : Who are the rebels , and do they represent a coherent democratic alternative to Gadhafi 's regime ? \nOr , will arming the opposition fuel a tribal conflict ? \nAnd Josh Felter and Brian Fishman warn that arming the rebels could simply fuel a deadly civil war , which could allow for a niche jihadi group to flourish : The more likely scenario than a clean rebel victory , however , is also more dangerous : that either military stalemate or internal divisions among rebel groups will lead to a chaotic civil war in which a small jihadi faction can flourish amid lawless conditions . \nHistory shows us that even a small band of determined extremists , if well led , armed , and equipped , can wreak havoc and challenge efforts to bring stability and order to a weakened state . \nAlgeria suffered a decade of terribly brutal civil war at the hands of extremists such as the Armed Islamic Group and its splinter faction the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat . \nOther examples include the Abu Sayyaf group in the southern Philippines , Jemaah Islamiyah in Indonesia , and Islamist extremist groups that fuel the insurgency in Chechnya . \nAnd al-Qaida in Iraq still kills on a scale that would be deemed completely unacceptable in any country where the recent past was not so tremendously violent . \nThe debate rages on . \nSpencer Ackerman notes that NATO is all over the place on the question of arming the Libyan rebels : The international community does not seem to have resolved the question of whether or not to arm the rebels . \nIn Brussels , the alliance s civilian leader firmly backed off that option in an interview with CNN . \nWe are not in Libya to arm people , said Anders Fogh Rasmussen , but to protect people . \nThat contradicted the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , Susan Rice . \nWe ve not , certainly , ruled that out , Rice told ABC s George Stephanopoulos , who said that the U.S. has an important interest in seeing Gadhafi step down . \nPresident Obama is obviously a man of conscious and the fact that he has refused to sit on his hands in the face of the happenings across Northern Africa and surly now events building in the Middle East demands that the U.S. needs to forge new policy . \nThe U.S still being a super power with responsibilities that come with the title , is obligated to lead not only in forming needed new international policies for America but also by example set the bar for all nations of the world to follow . \nBecause of our fundamental democratic believes , believes in freedoms , the rule of law , equality , and most importantly truth ; our policy makers now find themselves in a vary difficult position . \nThese countries around the globe with their populous demanding change and hopefully desiring to move towards a system similar to our own ; are now forcing us to evaluate our own policies in dealing with dictators that all the nations of the world have had relationships with for decades . \nIts time for the U.S. to begin the process of coming clean or the face the consequences ; that we can no longer continue this business as usual practices with murderous dictators . \nIf America and the nations of the civilized world continue trade relations with such dictators we not only promoting but also empower the vary behavior that we deplore . \nThe closest thing we have to a globe committee is the United Nations and honestly we all known the dysfunctional qualities of committee rule . \nGetting things done under such constraints are merely impossible , thus the other strong reason why America and currently the Obama administration needs to and has to take on these issues as impossible as they may seem . \nThe U.N. mandate 1973 is surly only the beginning of a conversation that all the nations of the world need to begin . \nThat if the nations of the world are going to come together in consistent policies that effect the populous of the world now is the time . \nIf our policy makers don t lead the way ; we are no better than an individual who buys stolen goods , from a murder . \nMarch 31 , 2011 at 2:29 pm | Reply It is a pity that the 70 % of the US population whose IQ are below average influence the decisions made by the remaining 30 % whose IQ are over and above the average . \nIs it a problem with democracy ? \nMarch 31 , 2011 at 11:49 pm | Reply Not that your comment warrants a response , but if the response of the elites is merely to criticize roll your eyes around and offer no meaning full response . \nThen I guess you honestly don t understand how freedom of expression or democracy works . \nApril 1 , 2011 at 10:05 am | Wow ! \nIt 's difficult to grasp most of your points because your writing is nearly incoherent . \nYou seem to suggest that President Obama is correct to take unilateral action on his own without regard to opinions of the US people -LRB- through their elected representatives in Congress -RRB- or the world opinion -LRB- the United Nations -RRB- . \nI suppose you would also support the Obama administration taking any unilateral action it chooses without consulting with anyone . \nThat sounds like dictatorship to me . \nApril 1 , 2011 at 8:01 am | Reply I do not suggest war or police actions I suggest that removing most favorable trade status from the likes of dictators who don t care to advance the interest of their own people . \nFurther those nations that ignore trade embargos be added to the same list . \nApril 1 , 2011 at 9:21 am | For the last 40-50 yrs our policy has been to support dictators at the cost of the people of those countries . \nIn part this is what helped create al-Qaeda and terrorist mind sets against the then super powers of Russia and USA . \nThe government which we the American people fund is directed by corporate American , and other international big bucks powers . \nTheir minds sets are protect the Oil , protect their profits protect our energy needs . \nIn the case of Libya its Italian , French , and British Oil interest that s being defended and the new Obama Doctrine forced on to him by the recent events in Egypt and across the Arabic countries . \nThe revolts by this people were inevitably going to happen you can only suppress truth for a short time in the new information age . \nThe promotion of Democracy is currently being forced on U.S. policy makers . \nLest they be seen as hypocrites and the general populous of Americans the same , So if we the American people truly believe in freedom we need to put our money were are mouths are or quit buying Oil from these dictators . \nApril 1 , 2011 at 9:37 am | Reply '' ... democratic believes , believes in freedoms ... '' believes is the key word , exactly ! \nWith 676 thousands dollars of debt per family you are very `` free '' comparing with the Lybians those had almost no debts under Gaddafi 's rule April 2 , 2011 at 7:21 pm | Reply The only right thing the U.S. can do is to do nothing at all . \nThis country has absolutely no business sticking it 's nose into Libya 's civil war but the right-wing thugs in Washington are adamant on doing so through their own arrogance and self-righteousness . \nNo wonder this country 's in the trouble it finds itself ! \nMarch 31 , 2011 at 4:22 pm | Reply Actually , Arab league , France and UK were much more adamant about it than these `` right-wing thugs in Washington '' . \nMarch 31 , 2011 at 5:50 pm | Reply This policy of do nothing sends a clear message to the dictators and the people of the world that life under their regimes . \nThat the Americans are comfortable with the actions of these dictators ; all we care is that they continue to sell us their Oil . \nAmericans and the nations of the world will continue to buy your goods so that the dictator can continue to dictate and Americans can t quite grasp why the people of other nations have doubts about the Americans . \nApril 1 , 2011 at 10:37 am | Reply Please do n't arm the freedom fighters , they have to succeed on the ground , now they have covert c.i.a. ops , no more should be needed . \nWe should start wrapping up our operations by July or sooner . \nIn and out and the freedom fighters will respect the U.S. more . \nMarch 31 , 2011 at 4:57 pm | Reply I ponder at times that our government may actually convince themselves that the general public who actually is aware of our involvement in other countries , is not happening at all ... did I make sense ?????? CIA involvement is and always will be `` covert '' . \nThus , since we have a `` habit '' of getting involve ... let , s accept the fact that the only solution is to simply go ahead and do the best we can . \nYes , there are parameters , but the simple solution is in this case is to arm the rebels , get Gaddafi out , and take it from there . \nMarch 31 , 2011 at 4:59 pm | Reply What the U.S. needs to do is to break it 's `` habit '' of getting involved and overcome it 's arrogance and self-righteousness . \nWe have absolutely no right to be there at all !!! March 31 , 2011 at 7:22 pm | Reply Is n't arming the rebels how Afghanistan wound up under Taliban rule ? \nThe rebels became the oppressors . \nMarch 31 , 2011 at 5:15 pm | Reply Obama wants Libyans saved from Gaddafi 's savage forces but does not care two hoots about the Afghans dying violent deaths at the hands of the US troops . \nIs it because he considers the lives of civilians in oil-rich Libya more valuable than those of poor Afghans ? \nApril 1 , 2011 at 12:37 am | Reply this is why we going broke . \ngiven out to much to others you dont see them helping us . \nMarch 31 , 2011 at 5:28 pm | Reply I find it strange that the U.S. sees no qualm to arm the rebels , while the Gaddafi forces get no reinforcement from outside due to arms embargo . \nEven if the rebels were armed with sophisticated weaponry , it is no guarantee that they would beat the government forces . \nOn the battlefield artillery does n't always help if one lacks experience and training . \nMarch 31 , 2011 at 5:47 pm | Reply No followup on March 20 French airstrike and failure of rebel militia to assess , see : BENGHAZI : AIRSTRIKE ASSESSMENT -LRB- EYES ONLY -RRB- You ca n't change horses in the middle of the stream . \nWe backed them and should see it through . \nWe should n't write them off so quick . \nDemocracy takes time and education , and eventually they will get there . \nAt this point , anything is better than Gadhafi . \nMarch 31 , 2011 at 6:40 pm | Reply WE HAVE ALWAYS DESERTED OUR ALLIES ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE . \nThis is nothing new April 1 , 2011 at 12:58 am | Reply North Korea , Saudi Arabia , Iran , China , Venezuela , Cuba , ... ... ... None of these countries are a democracy either should NATO enforce no fly zones over all of these countries so their citizens can revolt . \nThink about it ... ... We should arm the `` rebels '' with nuclear war heads with triggers set to go off as soon as they are armed ... Problem solved . \nThat is the only way to end fighting and blood shed in these backwards countries . \nMarch 31 , 2011 at 6:43 pm | Reply Your comments prompt me to ponder why American education has incubated so many nuts like you ? \nApril 1 , 2011 at 12:08 am | Reply We did n't back anybody . \nWe created a no-fly zone to protect civilians from being slaughtered by the thousands . \nRepublicans were for it , until Obama did it . \nArming the rebels is something that should not be taken lightly . \nWe armed the Afghan mujahideen in their fight against Soviet occupation . \nResearch that , and see what the consequences were . \nWe do n't need to make another mistake like that . \nMarch 31 , 2011 at 7:31 pm | Reply BS we were n't protecting citizens . \nWe are engaged in a full scale war , killing people and breaking things April 1 , 2011 at 1:00 am | Reply Arming the rebels may not be the best idea , but it is certainly better than the alternative . \nJust imagine instead of a Civil War in Libya that the headlines were more along the line of a genocide by Gadhafi killing all his protesting citizens . \nThe `` No Fly Zone '' however in my opinion is a clear sign of international unification against Gadhafi and for him to be tried for his crimes . \nIt also allowed the rebels to be doing as well as they are but I do agree with the `` Obama Doctrine '' that we need only interveen to protect our intrest , it does however seem to me like it allows us to pick and choose our battles which can help us in the future if we 're ever faced with a situation like the one in Libya . \nMarch 31 , 2011 at 7:59 pm | Reply The so-called `` Obama Doctrine '' will end up doing far more damage than any good . \nBesides , I get sick and tired of hearing all this Western propaganda about pro-Qadaffy forces killing `` civilians '' . \nAfter all , they 're killing `` rebels '' who are trying to take over Libya . \nWithout Western interference , this conflict would have ended by now . \nMarch 31 , 2011 at 8:18 pm | Reply The constant bombardment of Gadhafi ` s supporters will cause them to bow to the wishes of the coalition . \nA human can not take the noise of exploding shells for more than a month . \nThey will kiss arse for some quiet . \nMarch 31 , 2011 at 8:06 pm | Reply Ai n't that just like a Democrat : Blame Republicans for intervening in other country 's affairs , pass laws so that America ca n't interfere with other country 's affairs , then go right ahead and intervene in other country 's affairs . \nI 'm flat out disgusted with partisan politicians and the mindless morons who vote for them . \nAi n't that just like a Democrat : use doublespeak to conjure up a rationalization for Libyan involvement -LRB- when no valid reason exists -RRB- , depend on the partisan lemmings to regurgitate it , as if it is Holy and above question , engage in a push-button attack , then turn tail and hand the op over to France . \nWhat was it the Democrats had against Operation Iraqi Freedom again ? \nMarch 31 , 2011 at 11:35 pm | Reply The helter-skelter advance and retreat of the Libyan rebels is how Arabs fight when they are not trained by western powers . \nMostly it 's alot of shouting and bluster , firing off rounds in the general direction and falling back to regroup and find enough courage to advance again . \nOne guy who 'd been studying in America came and brought his own rifle which he did not know how to load -LRB- or clean -RRB- . \nVery emotional , not logical . \nHope the CIA sent Arab speakers because they wo n't listen to you otherwise and translating battlefield tactics and small weapons handling is tedious thru translators . \nEveryone will want to be a general but no one will know how to lead . \nIf Obama is too squeamish to get in he needs to take the head off the opposition quickly . \nThat means a sniper or close-in assassin to take out Gadhafi and his sons . \nThere are people who can do this and its alot cheaper in lives and money than a civil war fought by civilians . \nThe Europeans are the ones who use Libyan oil so let them do it . \nMarch 31 , 2011 at 11:44 pm | Reply April 1 , 2011 at 1:16 am | Reply Not to bring up folks ' dirty laundry but , it was Biden and Obama , among other Democratic leaders and followers , who suggested that Bush should be impeached because he convinced the Congress to grant him war powers . \nObama got the UN to agree but , that is n't what the Constitution requires . \nWe do n't NEED ANY OTHER COUNTRY to declare a war when it 's in our national interest . \nBut , we DO NEED THE CONGRESS TO AGREE . \nYou 're spending huge amounts of money every time you fire those cruise missles and even the cost of small arms can soar if you do n't have fire discipline on the line -LRB- such as your allies firing weapons in the air for fun -RRB- . \nIf they wanted to take the leader of Libya out they had adequate reasons without ANYONE but us agreeing to it . \nWhen is he going to seek Congressional approval for this escapade ? \nThey run the budget and every day of this stupidity cost this nation and YOU your taxes and inflation due to debt . \nObama is trying to criple the US economically to please his patron , Soros , and he 's losing the fight on spending in Congress . \nHe 's hoping by pulling this it works out several advantages for him . \nHe wants this exercise so he can appear to be a leader -LRB- about like the Ceasar in Gladiator -RRB- . \nHe wants this to force Congress in approve spending -LRB- which always has `` goodies '' for his party buried in them -RRB- . \nHe wants this because he 's trying to boost the union dues by trying to create more of a need for union labor . \nYes , they build a lot of the stuff we use . \nThere 's no down side for him except the very real grounds for impeachment for violating his oath of office . \nAnd , yes Martha , he did . \nApril 1 , 2011 at 12:20 am | Reply This is about oil and nothing else . \nGadhafi anounced in November he was going to give the Russian and Chinese companies the contracts and cut out Spain 's Repsol , France s Total , and Italy s Eni , Germany s Winstershall a unit of BASF and OMV of Austria . \nThe American companies involved are Occidental Petroleum , and Waha Oil , a joint venture with American oil companies ConocoPhillips , Marathon and Hess . \nSo boys , as you lay in the stinking desert dying for world corporate powers you can comfort yourself with the lie about freedom and democracy . \nThere has n't been a war about freedom and democracy since world WW II . \nApril 1 , 2011 at 1:07 am | Reply You 've laid the oil interest out very well . \nThe Europeans are being squeezed out by Russia and China . \nWars have started over alot less . \nAnd all it took was that one lone Tunisian fruit seller to light the fuse ! \nApril 1 , 2011 at 10:45 am | Reply Today the weapons given to the Mujahedin against the USSR are used against the USA in sports around the world . \nSo , what is the solution to preventing another Afghanistan ? \nArming Afghanistan 's rebels against the USSR led to Somalia , the Taliban , Lashkar E Taiba , and possibly even groups such as Abu Sayaf in the Phillipines , April 1 , 2011 at 3:17 am | Reply Libya is TOTALLY different situation . \nLibyans have clear goals and inherently peaceful people that hate wars and conflicts . \nJust looking for decent life and be on good terms with the rest of the world . \nThey were forced to defend themselves after seeing massacres committed against unarmed civilians . \nThe moment Gaddafi goes they will drop arms and build their countries . \nApril 3 , 2011 at 8:03 pm | Reply Today the weapons given to the Mujahedin against the USSR are used against the USA in spots around the world . \nSo , what is the solution to preventing another Afghanistan ?

April 3 , 2011 at 11:02 am | Reply Jesus Christ ! \nAmericans , do you ever learn any history ? \nOr you think that your example set in the 18th century would be true and applicable for everybody else ? \nLet me try to explain myself : there are two types of revolutions and therefore revolts around the world . \nOne is caused by intellectuals the other one by plebes . \nSo far the revolution by intellectuals occurred only in the US , which led to real changes and improvement on human rights -LRB- i.e. let me remind you , this is why you are celebrating July 4th each year -RRB- . \nThe revolution caused and conducted by plebes , on the other hand , is the type that almost all other revolutions throughout the history can be attributed to . \nYou want a list ? \nIt 's going to be a long one -LRB- but i 'll try to shorten to the key events in the world history -RRB- : French Revolution , Russian Bolshevik Revolution , Islamic Revolution in Persia . \nWhat do they all have in common ? \nInstead of making the lives of common people better , they ended up in large massacres : the reign of terror in France and thousands guillotined , the persecution of thousands of people in Russia by Lenin and Stalin and camps such as Gulag , the discrimination of killing of Bahais and people from other congregations in Iran . \nOne more example needs not to be forgotten is the war Afghanistan between Soviets and Taliban , where you , sweethearts , out of total stupidity and lack of any understanding of the situation , empowered Taliban , which eventually came back to bite you in the arse on 9\\/11 . \nSo go ahead , support the rebels , bring disorganized plebes and eventually Al-Qaeda to power , but then do n't complain and moan when you have another skyscrapers blown up and get your hands dirty with blood of lots and lots of civilians who will be beheaded because of the refusal to follow the Sharia law just like it happened in in Soviet Union in camps or public executions in Afghanistan . \nP.S. And if you really count on democratic elections there , remember the human psychology first and note the following facts : in the past years in Iran such leaders as Mahmoud Ahmadinejad came to power in an absolutely democratic way in Iran , Hamaz was also elected democratically in Gaza and the most notable example is Hitler , whose party was supported in 30 's by an overwhelming majority . \nApril 3 , 2011 at 2:17 pm | Reply Here the free speech -- The only way is to vote LEADERs who RESPECT LIFE WE DONOT NEED ALL THESE BUNCH OF SELFISH AND GREEDY LIP SERVICE GORVERNMENTS . \nNow the refugee caused by the wars , the MESS and the SUFFERING OF THESE POOR PEOPLE MANY CHARITIES HAVE TO HELP I know so little about politics but I speak on behalf of these refugee who are really man-made disasters , my friends were refugees before it was because of wars . \nIf a gorvenment really want to help the people they donot use FORCE BUT NEGOTIATING , TALKING before using force now more people being killed by all this fighting I am not a fan of the Libya dictator either he should had been resigned ashame of him people didnot want him as a leader why staying look -- now he has the consequence . \nI am sorry for the world 's news every day looking at the newspapers -- either natural disasters or man-made disasters , I just want to live as a human being -LRB- sometimes I think we are less than the animal kingdom -RRB- since we are not in the planet forever , why not make a good history ...

MITCH MCCONNELL , -LRB- R -RRB- MINORITY LEADER : The president 's target is decades from now , but Americans should be able to expect action now . \nCLOHERTY : While the president 's efforts to reduce oil prices bring motorists relief at the gas pump , the administration plans to raise fuel efficiency standards for car makers this fall , which could result in an increase in sticker prices . \nMegan Cloherty , for CNN , Washington . \nTOMEKA JONES , CNN STUDENT NEWS : What 's the word for when something on the internet spreads very quickly ? \nAZUZ : The video about bullying that 13-year-old Alye Pollack posted on YouTube went viral . \nWithin two weeks , nearly 50,000 people had seen it . \nAlye sat in front of the camera and held up pieces of paper introducing herself and sharing some of the names bullies have called her . \nThere 's been a lot of talk recently about the internet giving bullies more ways to pick on people . \nAlye turned the tables , going online to speak out against it . \nAnd she says her video is making an impact . \nALYE POLLACK , MADE ANTI-BULLYING VIDEO : I 've had a lot of people come up to me and say , `` Now I know not to say bad things . \nI think before I do say something . '' \nAnd that 's just amazing , because people are actually being affected by my video . \nEUNICE YOON , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT , HONG KONG : It 's 4:00 in the afternoon , rush hour . \nMost people in China are starting to go home from work . \nBut for the people of Qingyanliu village , their day has just started . \nThis tiny village near the manufacturing hub of Ewu sets its clock by the online habits of China 's shoppers . \nUntil five years ago , this place was a rural backwater . \nNow , its 10,000 residents generate $ 120 million in sales thanks to a popular e-retailing site called Taobao . \nE-commerce chief Liu Wengao says the village has grown five-fold , and is now a base for entrepreneurs looking to make it rich off online stores . \nLIU WENGAO , LOCAL E-COMMERCE CHIEF -LRB- TRANSLATED -RRB- : `` There are hundreds of millions of people in China and tens of millions on the internet , '' he says . \n`` We will never run out of customers . '' \nYOON : When China 's shoppers place their orders on Taobao , Chin Yao Moon 's merchants fill them at shops like this . \nLiu Jin has inventory of his own . \nBut if he does n't have what his customers want , someone else in this town will . \nLIU JIN , ONLINE MERCHANT -LRB- TRANSLATED -RRB- : `` We are over here picking up what we need to fulfill their order , '' Liu explains . \nYOON : Once his basket is full , he is off to start packing the evening shipments . \nThe entire village is alive with vendors like Liu . \nExpress trucks come and go seemingly nonstop into the wee hours . \nThousands of parcels are stacked daily , emerging from underground warehouses . \nThese basements have a mind-boggling array of goods , everything from the practical to the strange . \nThe government keeps rents in these buildings low , so people like Lin Saila can get started investing only in a room and a computer . \nToday , she received over 3,000 orders . \nLIN SAILA , STORE MANAGER -LRB- TRANSLATED -RRB- : `` Every year , there 's a lot of growth , '' she says . \n`` Each year is better than the last . '' \nYOON : Nearly all of this stuff is made right here in Ewu , so it 's convenient and it 's cheap to get . \nSo , what vendors do is that they take orders online , and then they package everything up and ship it right across the country . \nLiu has been to Beijing and Shanghai , but now this farmer 's son can stay closer to home . \nLIU -LRB- TRANSLATED -RRB- : `` I make money , '' he says . \n`` It gives me more freedom . '' \nYOON : The express truck is about to leave . \nLiu hustles to make sure his customers get what they want on time . \nLIU -LRB- TRANSLATED -RRB- : `` Every day is this hectic , '' he says . \n`` We 'll be back at it tomorrow in the town the Internet built . '' \nYOON : Eunice Yoon , CNN , Qingyanliu , China . \nAZUZ : Weird is how a lot of you describe yesterday 's `` TVs watching you '' story , when information about what people watch is shared with advertisers . \nSam does n't see a problem with it , writing `` it 's important for advertisers to locate a demographic to help them with their research . '' \nSadam can see how it would be better if ads were more relevant , but feels this is a major invasion of privacy . \n`` Random companies seeing what we watch on TV is not their business ; it 's ours . '' \nLevi states `` it 's not like they are watching you get dressed or anything ; they 're just trying to do business . \nI think they have every right to . '' \nFrom Brenna : `` It allows you to watch ads for things you 're interested in , instead of things you do n't even care about . '' \nBut Natalie writes `` the idea is n't foolproof in any way . \nIf it 's some sort of setting that can be turned off , though , it could help us greatly . '' \nAnd Kaylee , who says our privacy is being violated , adds it should either stop , or the companies could ask customers if they 're comfortable being monitored . \nGreat comments , y ' all ! \nAZUZ : Some guys need to work up a lot of nerve to ask someone to prom . \nJason here did n't seem to have that problem . \nHe wrote a song , roped his buddies into being a back-up band , got the whole class in on the idea . \nAnd all for one simple question . \nSure , he put her on the spot , but you know she said yes . \nWe 're just glad someone was recording the whole thing and posted it on YouTube . \nAZUZ : That way we can prom-ote Jason 's impressive proposal . \nYou might think a video like that would prom-pt us to make some jokes . \nBut we prom-ise not to . \nWe do promise that we 'll be back on Monday . \nHope you have a great weekend . \nFor CNN Student News , I 'm Carl Azuz . \n"}
{"id": "398", "time": "2011-03-31", "text": "By the CNN Wire Staff Libyan foreign minister flees country NEW : Foreign Minister Moussa Koussa is old and sick and had permission to leave , Libya claims The International Criminal Court does not consider him a suspect at the moment Koussa is the highest-ranking defector from the Gadhafi government so far Experts : He probably has information about the Lockerbie bombing , Libya 's arms program London -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The surprise arrival Wednesday of a tall , gray-haired man at a small airport outside of London raised eyebrows -- and it also raised hopes of a breakthrough on many fronts . \nThe man on the plane was Moussa Koussa , Libya 's foreign minister and former intelligence chief , and he was defecting from the regime of Moammar Gadhafi , the highest-ranking official yet to do so . \nKoussa was a stalwart defender of the government as recently as a month ago . \nBut in recent weeks , his demeanor has visibly changed . \nAt one recent media briefing , he kept his head down as he read a statement and left early . \nHe did not tell the Libyan government he was planning to quit before he arrived in Britain , Libyan government spokesman Mousa Ibrahim said Thursday . \nHoekstra : What may be next in Libya Libyan opposition speaks out on tactics Anderson : Gadhafi opposition badly armed But Ibrahim downplayed the defection itself , saying Moussa was an old man in poor health who had not been able to handle the pressure of his job . \n`` We gave him permission to leave , '' Ibrahim said , less than 24 hours after Libyan government denials that Koussa had defected , and insisted he was coming back . \nThe British Foreign Office announced late Wednesday that Koussa had resigned and come willingly to the United Kingdom . \nThere 's debate about whether his departure from Tripoli will weaken Gadhafi , with some saying it will be a signal to other doubters around Libya 's leader that it 's time to jump ship . \n`` It could potentially have a devastating impact on morale within the Gadhafi regime , '' said Noman Benotman , a former Libyan militant now with the Quilliam Foundation , a counter-extremism think tank . \n`` Strategically , this move attacks the center of gravity within the regime , '' Benotman said . \n`` I hope other senior figures within the regime now realize that they too need to be part of the solution and not remain part of the problem . '' \nBut others say that Koussa was never in Gadhafi 's innermost circle and that his departure is a significant blow but not a critical loss to the regime . \nWhether his defection precipitates further crumbling of the government in Tripoli or not , Koussa may be able to shed light on Libya 's exact role in events like the Lockerbie bombing in 1988 and the killing of a British policewoman in 1984 . \n`` Let 's remember , Moussa Koussa is the single most important Libyan official who was responsible for the intelligence service , the planning and execution of -LRB- the bombing of -RRB- Pan Am 103 , '' CNN national security contributor Frances Fragos Townsend said . \nHe was also a key player in Libya 's decision to give up its weapons of mass destruction program , said Townsend , who was a homeland security adviser in the George W. Bush administration . \n`` He was the single individual who had to approve or disapprove my going forward to meet with Gadhafi . \nAnd so he really does have secrets to tell , '' she said , adding that Libya 's leader confided in Moussa and relied on him . \nBritish intelligence will be questioning him and passing information to Americans , she anticipated . \nAnd she 's certain he arranged everything carefully before he boarded the plane for Britain . \n`` His finances , his immunity from prosecution and his freedom from extradition process -- he would have worked that all before he left , '' she said . \nBritish Foreign Secretary William Hague said Wednesday that Koussa had not been offered any immunity . \nOn Thursday , Hague reiterated calls for senior members of the Gadhafi government to step down . \nKoussa 's defection provides evidence `` that Gadhafi 's regime ... is fragmented , under pressure and crumbling from within , '' he said . \nKoussa is voluntarily speaking with officials in the UK , he said . \nThe International Criminal Court , which has opened an unprecedented investigation into possible crimes against humanity during the ongoing Libya civil war , said Thursday that Koussa is not a suspect . \n`` We have no individuals under investigation , and we will see where the evidence leads us , '' ICC prosecution spokeswoman Florence Olara said . \nShe said she did not know whether Koussa had been in touch with prosecutors seeking immunity or offering testimony . \nBut Scottish prosecutors want to question him about the Lockerbie bombing , the government there said Thursday . \nScottish officials said they have informed the Foreign Office in London that they want to speak to him . \n`` The investigation into the Lockerbie bombing remains open and we will pursue all relevant lines of inquiry , '' the government said in a statement . \nThe only person convicted in connection with the bombing , Abdelbeset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi , was freed from prison in Scotland in 2009 and sent home to Libya on the grounds that he had terminal cancer . \nCNN 's Nic Robertson , Anderson Cooper , Ben Wedeman , Richard Allen Greene and Carol Jordan contributed to this report . \n"}
{"id": "230", "time": "2011-03-31", "text": "Libyan rebels wave the flag of the rebellion as they gather near Brega March 31 . \nCIA operatives are inside Libya , sources tell CNN There is a debate over whether the U.S. should arm rebel forces Key issue : Can they be trained in time to use the weapons ? \nAlso , would the armed rebels then support NATO 's mission ? \nWashington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The United States has seen what happens when it arms rebel forces against brutal regimes -- and how it can backfire . \nLibya could end up in that same category . \nHere are some frequently asked questions on the situation in Libya , what the options are and the debate over arming the rebels . \nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization , of which the United States is a member , is working to take down Col. Moammar Gadhafi 's brutal regime , which has reportedly killed thousands of Libyans since a revolt broke out over the past month . \nAdm. Mike Mullen , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , said Thursday that Gadhafi still wants to take back the city of Benghazi , the rebel stronghold , and that the dictator `` will kill as many -LRB- people -RRB- as he must to crush the rebellion . '' \nFrance was the first nation to step in to enforce the no-fly zone directive . \nFrench fighter jets struck military targets in eastern Libya on March 19 . \nBritain also stepped into the conflict by providing logistical support . \nShortly after , U.S. fighter jets used air strikes to take out targets while warships launched missiles into the northern African nation . \nThe United States has since handed over the brunt of the mission to NATO , but it is still the major force behind the effort . \nBut administration officials , including Defense Secretary Robert Gates , insist that `` there will be no boots on the ground , '' or sending in U.S. troops to support the rebels . \nBy taking down Gadhafi , the country stands a chance at developing a democracy . \nIn essence , Gadhafi needs to go and prevent a humanitarian and refugee crisis that could help destabilize the entire region . \nIt 's a point that has been made clear from President Barack Obama , his administration and leaders around the world . \nWho are the opposition and what do they want ? \nSimply put , Libyans who are outraged at the atrocities that the Gadhafi regime has inflicted on its people including massive human rights violations . \nBut if the rebels are successful , there are concerns that such a fractured group could form an actual government -- or work with the U.S. And perhaps that is why Central Intelligence Agency operatives are inside Libya , a U.S. intelligence source said , to get firsthand knowledge of who the coalition is working with . \nWill U.S. arm Libya 's rebels ? \nRumsfeld speaks out on mission in Libya Gates : Obama followed War Powers Act Why it 's a bad idea Training Libyan rebels against Gadhafi 's forces comes down to education . \nCan the rogue group learn to use sophisticated machinery and the tactics to employ it in time -- and with a clear directive ? \n`` This is a nightmare trying to train the Libyans . \nI tried to do it many years ago , said Robert Baer , a former CIA operative . \n`` These people are very difficult to manage . '' \nBaer added that the type of discipline needed `` takes a very , very long time , especially when you 're dealing with a foreign force and you have to have Arabic speakers on the ground . \nIt 's tough . '' \nSo is it practical to arm the rebels fast enough ? \n`` Well , the notion of the gang that could n't shoot straight might be lived out , '' Retired Army Brigadier Gen. James Marks said . \n`` Absolutely , there must be some degree of training that is associated with arming this force . \nHowever , some weapons systems clearly they can get a handle on and they can use immediately . '' \n`` We simply do n't have control over the rebels . \nThey do n't have to follow our orders , '' Baer said . \n`` They take our money and weapons and go shoot who they want . '' \nWhy it 's a good idea Paul Wolfowitz , a deputy secretary of defense under former President George W. Bush , said it 's vital the U.S. supports arming the rebels . \n`` I think we should be doing everything we can to support the opposition , '' he said . \n`` It 's true , we do n't know what the opposition would be like when they take over , but there are actually some promising signs . '' \nAnother Bush official said that arming rebels is vital to the overall mission . \n`` Somebody has got to be on the ground doing the hard work of taking the territory , '' said former National Security adviser Stephen Hadley . \n`` And if it 's not going to be U.S. troops -- and nobody really wants that -- then we 're going to have to deal with the Libyan people and try to empower them to fight and win their own freedom . \nAnd giving them weapons has to be part of that . '' \nWill history come back to haunt us ? \nThe Soviet Union fought a brutal war in Afghanistan in the 1980s . \nThe U.S. , strictly opposed to the move by the `` evil empire , '' as former President Ronald Reagan called it , tried to tilt the balance by arming the Afghan mujahadeen against the Soviets . \nThough in the short term it helped the mujahadeen drive the Soviets out , some of those same weapons were used years later against the U.S. during the war in Afghanistan -- the longest war in the country 's history . \nRep. Mike Rogers , R-Michigan , said in a statement that he has deep concerns over such past efforts . \n`` We do n't have to look very far back in history to find examples of the unintended consequences of passing out advanced weapons to a group of fighters we did n't know as well as we should have , '' said Rogers , , who is chairman of of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence . \n`` We need to be very careful before rushing into a decision that could come back to haunt us . '' \nBut former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said that sometimes arming opposition forces can work . \n`` We did a good job in Afghanistan -LRB- arming -RRB- the Northern Alliance and some of their militias in the south and they were very successful in driving al Qaeda out of Afghanistan and of changing the regime from the Taliban to the Afghan government , '' Rumsfield said . \nAccording to Adm. James Stavrides , the U.S. NATO commander , U.S. intelligence has detected evidence of `` flickers '' of al Qaeda and Hezbollah elements among the rebels -- though the influence appears to be minimal . \nSenior officials and White House Press Secretary Jay Carney seemed to downplay that notion , saying that the values being expressed by the rebels are `` antithetical to the purposes and ideals set forth by terrorist organizations . '' \nRumsfeld , one of the key figure in taking the U.S. to war in Iraq , said there are concerns about terrorist groups such as al Qaeda and Hezbollah influencing the rebels . \nHe said that there are still a great deal of questions as to who is involved in the rebel group and therefore `` you have to be careful about arming rebels . '' \nRep. Dan Burton , R-Indiana , asked Thursday : `` How many of these citizen-soldiers fighting against Gadhafi -- how many are people who are tied into terrorist organizations in Iraq and Afghanistan and do we know who they are ? \nDo we have any idea ? '' \nHe added that it 's `` a heck of a situation when we go into a conflict and we do n't know who we are supporting . '' \nWhat 's it going to cost ? \nWhile NATO has taken over the military operations in Libya , the U.S. still has committed itself to support , which could result in billions of dollars in aid going forward . \nMeanwhile in Washington , the battle in Congress is over cutting spending , reducing the deficit and passing a 2011 budget . \nThere is no doubt that critics on both sides of the aisle will grill administration officials on why the U.S. should add money the country does n't have -- and whether the operation could stretch the already overstretched U.S. military . \nCNN 's Reza Sayah , Alan Silverleib , Tom Cohen , Arwa Damon , Nic Robertson , Amir Ahmed , Pam Benson , Paula Newton and Yousuf Basil contributed to this report . \n"}

Charles Bouchard fielded questions on the possibility that civilians had been hurt as a result of NATO operations . \nA Vatican envoy reported that as many as 40 civilians had been killed . \nA closer look at Bashar al-Assad `` It is a news report and I appreciate the source of this report , but it is worth noting that I take every one of those issues seriously , '' said Bouchard from the mission 's operational command in Naples , Italy . \n`` We are very careful in the prosecution of any of the possible targets that we have . \nWe have very strict rules of engagement provided to us and we are operating within the legal mandate of our United Nations mandate , '' he added . \nRussian diplomatic officials , meanwhile , warned against a `` creative '' interpretation of the U.N. resolution and hinted it was beginning to regret its decision to abstain during the U.N. vote . \nRussia , as one of the Security Council 's permanent members , has veto power . \nBut NATO officials insist they are employing the strictest interpretation of the resolution . \n`` The alliance has nothing to hide -- not to Russia and not to you , '' Adm. Giampaolo Di Paola , chairman of NATO 's Military Committee , told a press briefing at NATO headquarters . \n"}
{"id": "125", "time": "2011-03-31", "text": "Here 's an excerpt from the op-ed I wrote today in The Washington Post : American statesmen have always experimented with the use of limited military means to support foreign policy interests that are important , and worth engaging American power , but not vital . \nFrom the Barbary wars -LRB- fought against the Barbary States , which included parts of modern Libya -RRB- to gunboat diplomacy in Asia to the many military interventions over the past few decades -LRB- Grenada , Lebanon , Somalia , the no-fly zone over Iraq , Bosnia , Kosovo -RRB- , the United States has often tried to find ways to use its military yet not engage in all-out war . \nSome were more successful than others , but in all cases , the central task was to find the balance between the goals we sought and the means we were willing to deploy . \nThe time we didn t ask questions about the costs and simply escalated the means , we ended up in Vietnam . \nThe tendency for a president is to be pushed to achieve a decisive victory , no matter the costs , no matter whether the interests at stake are vital or secondary . \nPresidents want to be leaders of great causes , and the Libyan mission is certainly a good cause . \nBut the more grandiose the rhetoric and the goals , the broader the military mission . \nAnd then the United States takes responsibility for the fate of Libya a country riven with tribes , lacking strong institutions and a civil society , and destroyed by four decades of Gaddafi s madness . \nDo we really want to own this , and largely alone ? \nIs it such a bad idea that others should be involved ? \nWashington is now hoping that a bit more military power will dislodge Gaddafi s regime . \nMy fingers are crossed . \nBut it would be far more sensible , while hoping for the best , to plan for other likely outcomes ... As I argue in the op-ed , limited interventions might have limited successes , but they can also avoid catastrophic failures . \nPresident Obama 's reasons for employing U.S. military force in Libya are idealistic at best , if not hopelessly romantic at worst . \nUnfortunately , idealism is not what drives , much less influences significantly , the clashes and movements in relations between and among nation states . \nForeign policy veterans , and most military leaders know that intuitively , if not explicitly . \nWoodrow Wilson s League of Nations idea following The Great War is a good example of what happens when the ideal conflicts with the real . \nAs Americans , we harbor very idealistic notions about wars of rebellion . \nIt is part of our own History , mythology , and legends . \nHistory is grittier than what we wish , and harder than what we would like to remember . \nAll civil wars and rebellions are ugly . \nSomething President Obama and the rest of us will learn in due course in Libya . \nMarch 31 , 2011 at 11:35 am | Reply Arabian Spring ? \nPresident Obama is obviously a man of conscious and the fact that he has refused to sit on his hands in the face of the happenings across Northern Africa and surly now events building in the Middle East demands that the U.S. needs to forge new policy . \nThe U.S still being a super power with responsibilities that come with the title , is obligated to lead not only in forming needed new international policies for America but also by example set the bar for all nations of the world to follow . \nBecause of our fundamental democratic believes , believes in freedoms , the rule of law , equality , and most importantly truth ; our policy makers now find themselves in a vary difficult position . \nThese countries around the globe with their populous demanding change and hopefully desiring to move towards a system similar to our own ; are now forcing us to evaluate our own policies in dealing with dictators that all the nations of the world have had relationships with for decades . \nIts time for the U.S. to begin the process of coming clean or the face the consequences ; that we can no longer continue this business as usual practices with murderous dictators . \nIf America and the nations of the civilized world continue trade relations with such dictators we not only promoting but also empower the vary behavior that we deplore . \nThe closest thing we have to a globe committee is the United Nations and honestly we all known the dysfunctional qualities of committee rule . \nGetting things done under such constraints are merely impossible , thus the other strong reason why America and currently the Obama administration needs to and has to take on these issues as impossible as they may seem . \nThe U.N. mandate 1973 is surly only the beginning of a conversation that all the nations of the world need to begin . \nThat if the nations of the world are going to come together in consistent policies that effect the populous of the world now is the time . \nIf our policy makers don t lead the way ; we are no better than an individual who buys stolen goods , from a murder . \nMarch 31 , 2011 at 2:31 pm | Reply Does the U.S. want to own Libya ? \nOf course it does !!!

What a ridiculous question ! \nMarch 31 , 2011 at 4:41 pm | Reply This question seems to confirm the views of the Libyan people lately , that the U.S. is after their oil . \nOtherwise the Americans ca n't be bothered to engage themselves in this millitary foray . \nNo , the U.S. does n't necessarily want to own Libya , but it wants to show the world , who has more to say . \nMarch 31 , 2011 at 6:29 pm | Reply Of course the U.S. wants to own Libya as anybody with half a brain would surmise . \nWhy do you think that Obama 's setting up a `` no-fly '' zone and now arming the `` rebels '' for ? \nAfter all , Libya is an oil rich country like Iraq and we invaded Iraq and now own it for that very same reason . \nMarch 31 , 2011 at 7:36 pm | Reply ahhh , thats all i needed to know to understand the US involvement ... i was wondering why the US even cared but now it all makes sense once again May 7 , 2012 at 7:09 am | This is a three layered chess game for the removal of a dictator . \nIf I may explain the first layer of the game is a least cost intervention meaning no blood and very modest treasure used . \nSecond layer is the CIA they will goose things along to the conclusion and the objective we need . \nThird layer offer buisness and jobs for all of those 20 year olds that just want the freedom to get jobs that pay well . \nThis is known as a piece of the action . \nRemember if our emotions control our moves we will loose . \nEverybody thought Regan was nuts two but it worked . \nThere was no real operational star wars program . \nI am going with the President on this one he is precise when he wants to get something done . \nApril 1 , 2011 at 1:41 am | Reply I feel it serves the U.S. well in keeping some portion of the globe destabilized , but in the end , this game is going on since far too long for anybody 's comfort , American Middle East policies have indirectly contributed to the economic down slide of that nation . \nit would be in everybody 's interest that America stops playing the global cop , else it might find itself pitted against the whole world in manner of the Nazis during the penultimate stages of the WW II . \nApril 1 , 2011 at 2:12 am | Reply US only wants to liberate Libya with democracy , as it always has . \nSaying this in case Americans have forgotten their heritage ... April 2 , 2011 at 1:28 am | Reply It grieves me to see mindless cynicism and downright non-comprehension in the comments here . \nThe question is not whether we want to `` own '' Libya , but whether we want to `` take ownership '' as the current business jargon goes of the whole Libyan situation . \nI think the administration has answered that with a resounding `` no '' . \nAfghanistan and Iraq show what happens when we involve ourselves in primitive countries with tribal loyalties and no history of democratic institutions . \nWhen you remove a dictator in a country of this nature , all you do is create a power vacuum . \nIf you leave , you will just leave it to some warlord to take over again . \nIf you stay and try to do `` country building '' with military means -LRB- and the military are the wrong ones to do this in any case -RRB- you just unite the people against you as the foreign occupier . \nNo fly zone to prevent a Rwanda style massacre of innocent civilians ? \nOk , but let the other Arab states do that . \nNo , we do n't want to `` own '' the Libya mess . \nThat 's for the Libyans to figure out . \nApril 4 , 2011 at 12:10 am | Reply -LRB- required , but will not be displayed -RRB- CNN welcomes a lively and courteous discussion as long as you follow the Rules of Conduct set forth in our Terms of Service . \nComments are not pre-screened before they post . \nYou agree that anything you post may be used , along with your name and profile picture , in accordance with our Privacy Policy and the license you have granted pursuant to our Terms of Service . \nEnter your email address to follow this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email . \nWhat #Pope Benedict leaves behind : Kathleen Sprows Cummings gives her take on GPS : bit . \nly\\/11C7KM4 Poor sanitation , water supply cause economic losses of about $ 260 billion annually in developing nations : World Bank bit . \nly\\/11Bw3d6 3:44 pm ET February 11 , 2013 RETWEET `` Since peaking in 2009 at 10.1 % of GDP , U.S. budget deficit has fallen . \nThis year , CBO says , it will be 5.3 % '' : Cassidy nyr . \nkr\\/12tXrci 12:35 pm ET February 11 , 2013 RETWEET What has #China banned TV advertisements for ? \nTry the GPS weekly quiz to find out : bit . \nly\\/Y4AvJ6 9:32 am ET February 11 , 2013 RETWEET Five Arab leaders give their take on regional issues on GPS this Sunday at 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. ET on CNN \n"}
{"id": "382", "time": "2011-04-19", "text": "By the CNN Wire Staff Britain to send military into Libya The EU is prepared to send troops for humanitarian assistance Opposition spokesman : 24 were killed and 113 were injured in Misrata this week He says residents in Misrata are disappointed with NATO Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Britain said Tuesday it is expanding its presence in Libya with military advisers and the European Union said it is prepared to send troops for humanitarian assistance if requested by the United Nations . \nPlans for increased Western involvement surfaced as Moammar Gadhafi 's forces shelled Misrata again Tuesday . \nResidents and refugees rescued from the city described a terrifying situation in the ravaged western city that continues daily to pay a heavy price in the Libyan war . \n`` The situation is very dangerous , every day the shelling is increasing , '' said a resident who was not identified for safety reasons . \n`` They are using more types of weapons , and people are wondering why NATO is not doing anything . '' \nThe number of casualties was unclear Tuesday but at least 24 people have already died in Misrata his week , an opposition spokesman told CNN Monday . \nHe said another 113 were injured . \nRebel-compiled figures estimate that more than 10,000 people have been killed so far in the Libyan conflict and more than 55,000 have been injured . \nMedics overwhelmed by Misrata misery With a humanitarian disaster looming , the EU said it is ready to respond , but not without the blessing of the United Nations . \nAn EU official , who asked not to be identified , said it is unclear how many troops would be deployed , though he said the number would be `` definitely less than 1,000 . '' \nThe Council of the European Union agreed to the operation -- called EUFOR Libya -- earlier this month . \nIf requested , EUFOR Libya would `` contribute to the safe movement and evacuation of displaced persons '' and support humanitarian agencies in their activities , the council said in a written statement . \nAnd Britain said it is sending a contingent of experienced military officers to the rebel stronghold of Bengazhi in an advisory role . \nThe team will work with Libya 's Transitional National Council on how the opposition can improve military organizational structures , communications and logistics , the British Foreign Office said . \nIt will also assist in the delivery of critically needed aid . \n`` This deployment is fully within the terms of UNSCR 1973 both in respect of civilian protection and its provision expressly ruling out a foreign occupation force on Libyan soil , '' Foreign Secretary William Hague said on Tuesday . \n`` Consistent with our obligations under that resolution , our officers will not be involved in training or arming the opposition 's fighting forces . \nNor will they be involved in the planning or execution of the NTC 's military operations or in the provision of any other form of operational military advice . '' \nThe moves raise questions of whether a greater international military involvement on the ground could emerge . \nThe Center for Strategic and International Studies ' Stephen Flanagan said the British stance is another step up the level of military engagement . \nHe said he thinks that the British forces are trying to give `` more coherence '' and `` greater capacity '' to the efforts of the rebels to provide their own defense and that the alliance is trying to find more ways to keep up the pressure . \nBut he does n't think using ground troops to get in the middle of intense urban conflict and civil war is on the allies ' minds right now . \nKeeping the pressure on Gadhafi and letting his forces know that the coalition is well intact is the hope , even if the allies do n't want to fight house to house themselves , Flanagan said . \nAt the same time , he said , `` it 's hard to speculate . \nIf Misrata fell would there be a turn ? '' \nAnother analyst , the Brookings Institution 's Michael E. O'Hanlon , questions the hesitance of `` casualty-averse '' Western democracies to provide aid such as military training . \nHe thinks more aid might turn out to be bolder and more helpful than keeping the forces they are supporting with air power at arm 's length . \nHe said the allies should n't content themselves with `` incrementalism . '' \n`` We may wind up providing some of the things we 're skittish about , '' he said . \nMeanwhile , Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini said Tuesday that the international Libya Contact Group , charged with helping map out Libya 's future , will discuss ways Libyan rebels can facilitate the sale of oil from rebel-held areas to international outlets when the contact group meets in Rome next month . \nTransitional National Council President Mustafa Abdul Jalil , speaking with Frattini , reminded the world again of Gadhafi 's indiscriminate attacks in population centers . \nAid groups have been attempting to pluck desperate people from Misrata , which is hemmed in by Gadhafi 's forces on three sides . \nThe only escape route is by sea . \nThe International Organization of Migration chartered boats to evacuate stranded migrant workers and Britain said it will help another 5,000 people get out . \nMohammed , an opposition spokesman who wanted to be identified only by his first name for safety reasons , said Misrata residents are disappointed with NATO , empowered by the United Nations to use force to protect civilians . \nBut Misrata had not seen NATO airstrikes in several days , Mohammed said . \n`` Gadhafi 's forces are not threatened by NATO anymore . \nThe NATO planes are circulating as the destruction continues , '' he said . \nNATO , however , reported progress in its mission . \nAs of Monday , it had flown 771 sorties and 1,110 strike sorties . \nThe NATO operation destroyed seven ammunition bunkers in the Tripoli area and four air defense radars in the Misrata area this week , the alliance said , along with equipment in the areas of Zintan and Sirte , Gadhafi 's hometown . \nNATO has said Gadhafi 's forces have started hiding resources in civilian areas , making airstrikes more difficult to carry out without harming civilians . \nBut Gadhafi 's regime has given no sign of standing down . \nValerie Amos , U.N. under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator , met with the Libyan regime over the weekend . \n`` Let me be absolutely clear . \nI got no guarantees with respect to my call for the overall cessation of hostilities to enable people to move , to enable us to deliver supplies , '' Amos said Monday . \n`` I did get an assurance from the government to carry out a needs assessment in Misrata . '' \nShe added , `` I have to say , in that instance , we got no guarantees at all that the violence would cease . '' \nCNN 's Reza Sayah , Yousuf Basil , Ben Wedeman and Joe Sterling contributed to this report . \n"}
