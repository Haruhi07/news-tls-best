Oil spill : BP ` may suspend dividend payout ' Board of energy giant to discuss withholding dividend as efforts to cap ruptured well put strain on US - British relations <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010-06-12">Saturday</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-06-12">12 June 2010</TIMEX3> 13.47 BST Thick oil from the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill floats on the surface of the water near Port Sulphur in Louisiana .
Photograph : Saul Loeb\/AFP\/Getty Images BP could suspend its dividend payout to shareholders over the Gulf of Mexico oil spill , the energy giant has confirmed .
The company said its board would meet on <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-06-14">Monday</TIMEX3> to consider withholding the latest tranche of a # 7bn annual payout .
The move comes as David Cameron and Barack Obama prepare to discuss the crisis <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="TIME" value="2010-06-12TAF">this afternoon</TIMEX3> .
A BP spokesman admitted there had been ` ` a lot of political pressure '' on the company , and said that suspending the dividend was ` ` an option that 's up for discussion '' .
` ` No decision has been made on it , we are looking at options , '' he said .
` ` There 's a board meeting on <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2010-06-07">Monday</TIMEX3> , but they are not necessarily going to take a decision on it then . ''
Scientists have said that the amount of oil gushing out of the ruptured well , which bores a mile deep into the seabed , is far higher than previously estimated .
Up to 40,000 barrels <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> , over a period of weeks , could have escaped before containment efforts were implemented , the US Geological Survey calculated .
The US president was due to phone Cameron at <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="TIME" value="2010-06-07T16:00">4 pm</TIMEX3> -LRB- UK time -RRB- , before taking his fourth trip to the Gulf coast to assess the response to the spill and meet affected residents on <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2010-06-07">Monday</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2010-06-08">Tuesday</TIMEX3> , the White House said .
There have been claims that Obama 's hard line on BP is jeopardising both its share price and British pensions .
Cameron has been under pressure from senior figures , such as the London mayor , Boris Johnson , to defend BP and stand up to his US counterpart .
Cameron <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2010-06-11">yesterday</TIMEX3> told the BP chairman , Carl - Henric Svanberg , that it was ` ` in everyone 's interests that BP continues to be a financially strong and stable company '' .
But the prime minister acknowledged Obama 's anger , adding that he too was ` ` frustrated and concerned about the environmental damage caused by the leak '' .
Svanberg has been summoned to the White House for talks with Obama on <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2010-06-09">Wednesday</TIMEX3> .
The deputy prime minister , Nick Clegg , said <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2010-06-11">yesterday</TIMEX3> that he would not allow the row to become a '' tit - for - tat political diplomatic spat '' .
