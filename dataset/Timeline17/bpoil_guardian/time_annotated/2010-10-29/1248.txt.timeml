BP and Halliburton knew of Gulf oil well cement flaws US investigator says cement mixture failed three out of four tests carried out before explosion <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010-10-29">Friday</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-10-29">29 October 2010</TIMEX3> 08.38
BST Fire burns on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-04">April</TIMEX3> .
Investigators say cement used on the well did not meet industry standards .
Photograph : US coastguard\/EPA BP and Halliburton were aware of flaws in the cement used to seal the doomed well in the Gulf of Mexico , according to the lead investigator for the presidential commission on the oil spill .
In a letter to the commission , the investigator , Fred Bartlit , said the cement mixture used on the well did not meet industry standards , and failed three out of four laboratory tests before the Deepwater Horizon explosion on <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">20 April</TIMEX3> .
Halliburton , which was hired by BP to cement the well , learned of those failures in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-02">February</TIMEX3> , and informed BP on <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2010-03-08">8 March</TIMEX3> .
But both firms chose to go ahead with the nitrogen foam cement mixture , which was supposed to secure the bottom of the well .
` ` Halliburton -LRB- and perhaps BP -RRB- should have considered redesigning the foam slurry , '' the letter said .
However , Halliburton said it did not believe that the foam cement design used on the well caused the incident .
` ` Halliburton believes that significant differences between its internal cement tests and the commission 's test results may be due to differences in the cement materials tested , '' the company said in a statement issued in response to the letter .
` ` The commission tested off - the - shelf cement and additives , whereas Halliburton tested the unique blend of cement and additives that existed on the rig at the time Halliburton 's tests were conducted . ''
The company added : ` ` Halliburton believes that had BP conducted a cement bond log test , or had BP and others properly interpreted a negative pressure test , these tests would have revealed any problems with Halliburton 's cement . ''
A fourth test , performed in <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2010-04">April</TIMEX3> , did indicate the cement would hold .
But Bartlit said BP did not have the results of that test before <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2010-04-19">19 April</TIMEX3> , when it ordered work crews to begin pumping cement into the well .
The finding offers some good news for BP , whose own investigative report on the spill <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2010-09">last month</TIMEX3> zeroed in on problems in the cement seal performed by Halliburton .
Like BP 's investigators , the commission conducted its own tests on the cement design used by Halliburton although they had an exact recipe .
The mixture failed all nine stability tests .
The companies involved in the catastrophic spill BP , Transocean , which owned the rig , Halliburton , and others are engaged in a high stakes fight to shift blame , and millions of dollars in liability , for the explosion and spill .
Bartlit cautioned that the failure of the cement seal alone was not the sole cause for the oil disaster .
` ` The story of the blowout does not turn solely on the quality of the Macondo cement job .
Cementing wells is a complex endeavor and industry figures inform us that cementing failures are not uncommon in the best of circumstances , '' he wrote .
The oil industry had developed other common tests to ensure against cement failures , he said .
` ` BP and\/or Transocean personnel misinterpreted or chose not to conduct such tests at the Macondo well . ''
