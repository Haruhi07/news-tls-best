BP oil spill mostly cleaned up , says US White House says 75 % of oil captured , burned off , evaporated or broken down as ` static kill ' operaion shows signs of working <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-08-04">Wednesday</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-08-04">4 August 2010</TIMEX3> 10.55 BST

The US government said <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-08-04">today</TIMEX3> that most of the oil that leaked into the Gulf of Mexico has been cleaned up as BP reported that a '' static kill '' blocking procedure was stopping more crude pouring into the gulf .

The White House energy adviser , Carol Browner , said a new assessment had found that about 75 % of the oil had been captured , burned off , evaporated or broken down in the Gulf .
The volume of the remaining oil , however , is still more than four times larger than the amount lost from the Exxon Valdez tanker in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="1989">1989</TIMEX3> .
` ` It was captured .
Mother Nature did her part , '' Browner said of the Gulf oil spill .
She added that about 25 % remained .
BP said it had reached a significant milestone overnight when mud forced down the Gulf of Mexico well the static kill operation held back the flow of crude .
Workers stopped pumping mud into the well after <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="PT8H" mod="APPROX">about eight hours</TIMEX3> and were monitoring it to ensure it remained stable , BP said .
` ` It 's a milestone , '' said a spokeswoman , Sheila Williams said .
` ` It 's a step towards the killing of the well . ''
Site leader Bobby Bolton said the pressure in the well dropped quickly in the first <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="PT90M">90 minutes</TIMEX3> of the procedure , indicating that everything was going to plan .
Crews must <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> decide when to use cement as a final cap .
Federal officials will not declare victory until a successful ` ` bottom kill '' when mud is pumped into the well bottom two to three miles below the sea floor and then cemented is completed .
That procedure will not happen for <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="PXW">several weeks</TIMEX3> .
` ` We ' ve pretty much made this well not a threat , but we need to finish this from the bottom , '' said Thad Allen , the official appointed by Barack Obama to lead the federal response to the disaster .
The static kill involved slowly pumping the mud from a ship into the top of the ruptured well a mile below .
A ` ` top kill '' procedure when mud is forced against the flow of oil had failed in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2010-05">May</TIMEX3> when the mud could not overcome the pressure of the oil .
BP will not know for certain whether the static kill has succeeded until engineers can use the relief well .
That is due to be completed soon .
The well will be used to execute the bottom kill .
The task is becoming more urgent because the peak hurricane season is just around the corner , Allen said .
