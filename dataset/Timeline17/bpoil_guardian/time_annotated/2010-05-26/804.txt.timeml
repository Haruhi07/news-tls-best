BP attempts to plug Gulf of Mexico oil leak with mud in ` top kill ' technique Company awaits test results before trying to choke off Deepwater Horizon leak by force - feeding it mud and cement Live video of BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
The latest effort to stem the leak comes as two congressman said warning signs were identitifed before the explosion <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2010-04">last month</TIMEX3> that brought down the company 's Deepwater Horizon oil rig .
The company is awaiting the results of diagnostic tests , which will indicate whether it can <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-05-26" mod="END">later today</TIMEX3> begin the top kill procedure of choking off the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico by force - feeding it heavy drilling mud and cement .
The process has never been tried so deep underwater before and if it fails , it could make the leak worse .
It comes as politicians and others are losing patience with the company over its several failed attempts to stop the leak that started <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-04" mod="MORE_THAN">more than a month ago</TIMEX3> after an offshore drilling rig exploded .
About 7 m gallons of crude have spilled into the sea since , fouling Louisiana 's marshes and coating birds and other wildlife .
` ` We want what everybody wants to stop the flow at the source as quickly as possible , '' said BP spokesman John Curry .
` ` We understand the frustration and we just want to bring this to closure . ''
BP chief executive officer , Tony Hayward , pegged its chances of success at 60 % to 70 % .

And the company said those who want to can watch the procedure online .
Live video of the leak has been available for <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="PXD">the past few days</TIMEX3> , and BP said that it will continue throughout the procedure .
The attempt comes as more hearings <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-W21">this week</TIMEX3> focused on what led to the explosion on <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">20 April</TIMEX3> aboard the Deepwater Horizon that killed 11 workers and triggered the catastrophe .
Senior managers from Transocean , which owned the rig , were complaining that day that BP was ` ` taking shortcuts '' by replacing heavy drilling fluid with seawater in the well , according to sworn testimony by Truitt Crawford , a rig roustabout .
BP was leasing the rig and is responsible for stopping the leak and the cleanup .
The seawater was being used in preparation for dropping a final blob of cement into the well as a temporary plug for the pipe .
Workers had finished pumping the cement into the exploratory well to bolster and seal it against leaks until a later production phase .
Crawford said seawater would provide less weight to contain surging pressure from the ocean depths .
His testimony was expected to be part of a hearing in New Orleans .
A BP spokesman declined to comment on what he said .
Dozens of worker statements obtained by The Associated Press describe the hours and minutes before the sudden , violent blowout and many said they were concerned about the pressure coming from below .
And tests within <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="PT1H">an hour</TIMEX3> of the blast indicated the pressure was building , according to a congressional memo .
The buildup was an ` ` indicator of a very large abnormality , '' in the well , BP 's investigator said .
The rig team was ` ` satisfied '' that another test was successful and resumed adding the seawater , said the memo by Henry Waxman and Bart Stupak to members of the committee on energy and commerce , which is investigating what went wrong .
There were other warning signs of problems included an unexpected loss of fluid from a pipe known as a ` ` riser '' <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="PT5H">five hours</TIMEX3> before the explosion , which could have indicated a leak in the blowout preventer , the memo said .
The blowout preventer is designed to shut down the well in case of an emergency .
BP has cited its failure as a contributor to the blast .
If all goes as planned , engineers will pump fluid twice as dense as water from two barges into two 3 - inch - wide lines that will feed it into the blowout preventer .
Crews plan to pump it in at a rate of 1,680 to 2,100 gallons per minute in an attempt counteract the upward pressure of oil gushing to the surface .
They stockpiled some 50,000 barrels of the heavy mud , a manufactured substance that resembles clay .
Bob Bea , an engineering professor at the University of California at Berkeley , said the procedure carries a high risk of failure because of the velocity at which the oil may be spewing .
` ` I certainly pray that it works , because if it does n't there 's this long waiting time '' before BP can dig relief wells that would cut off the flow , Bea told The Associated Press .
Wells said it could take <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="P2D" mod="EQUAL_OR_LESS">up to two days</TIMEX3> to determine whether the top kill is working .
