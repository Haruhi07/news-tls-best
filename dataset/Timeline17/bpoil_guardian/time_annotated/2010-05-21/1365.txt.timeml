BP switches on live video from oil leak Gush of oil from Deepwater Horizon oil spill <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> being broadcast live after BP accused of withholding information from ocean floor
A still of live video from the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
Photograph : Spillcam <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P1M">One month</TIMEX3> after the fiery collapse of the Deepwater Horizon , BP bowed to demands from scientists and members of Congress <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-W20">this week</TIMEX3> and has posted a live video feed of the gusher of oil on the ocean floor .
The decision came only hours after a hearing in Congress in which BP was accused of withholding data from the ocean floor , and blocking efforts by independent scientists to come up with estimates for the amount of crude spewing into the Gulf <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EACH">each day</TIMEX3> .
Ed Markey , who presided over the hearing , said BP would post the footage on the website of his house subcommitte on energy independence and global warming as early as <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="TIME" value="2010-05-26TNI">Wednesday night</TIMEX3> .
It was delayed but is <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> live .
The footage could help defuse rising anger at BP from scientists and news organizations at the oil company 's reluctance even to discuss the size of the spill .
BP has refused to share data gathered by cameras on its submersible robots .
Its officials have also insisted repeatedly that it is impossible to determine the size of the spill .
The lack of disclosure put BP under fire <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-05-20">yesterday</TIMEX3> .
` ` Oil has been spewing into the ocean for <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P30D">30 days</TIMEX3> yet the true extent of this spill remains a mystery , '' an angry Markey told the hearing <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010-05-20">yesterday</TIMEX3> .
` ` BP thinks this is their ocean so they should control information about the spill . ''
The Obama administration too was criticised for sticking to its early estimates of 5,000 barrels <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> a much lower estimate than those produced by independent scientists .
The coast guard said <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2010-W20">this week</TIMEX3> it was assembling a team of experts to produce an estimate of the spill .
<TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2010-05-20" mod="START">Earlier yesterday</TIMEX3> , four independent scientists told Markey 's committee that BP 's refusal to release the footage was blocking independent efforts to estimate the size of the spill .
Richard Camilli , a scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute , said BP had intitially reached out to experts for help in measuring the spill .
He was set to fly to Houston to join the effort at <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="TIME" value="2010-05-20T03:00">3 am</TIMEX3> on <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2010-05-05">5 May</TIMEX3> .
<TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DURATION" value="P1D">A day</TIMEX3> later , BP called off the visit .
` ` The rationale was that they were on a very tight time schedule , '' he said .
` ` The greater priority was to place the containment structure over the main leak '' an effort that failed .
Frank Muller - Karger , an oceanographer at the University of South Florida , told the hearing the full consequences of the spill or of the chemicals used in the clean - up effort remained unknown .
` ` I think this is a problem we are going to have to live with for years rather than months , '' he said .
Before <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="TIME" value="2010-05-20TNI">last night</TIMEX3> 's decision , BP had released just two short pieces of video from the ocean floor frustrating scientists who had been trying to estimate the size of the spill .
But experts still managed to use the first clip , which was barely <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DURATION" value="PT30S">30 seconds</TIMEX3> long and low - resolution , to produce estimates that were many times larger than the Obama administration estimate of 5,000 barrels <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> .
Steve Wereley , an associate professor at Purdue University who was also at <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2010-05-20">yesterday</TIMEX3> 's briefing , came up with an estimate of 70,000 barrels <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> .
He told the committee <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2010-05-20">yesterday</TIMEX3> he could not conceive of a scenario where the flow of oil from the ruptured well was only 5,000 barrels <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> .
` ` All outsider estimates are considerably higher than BP 's . ''
