The report , to be released in full on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011-01-04">Tuesday</TIMEX3> , is utterly damning .
The safety failures of BP and its contractors Haliburton and Transocean were ` ` systemic '' , due to a ` ` failure of management '' and , without reform , a repeat accident ` ` may well occur '' .
Worse , these are the best operators in the global industry and BP was led by Tony Hayward who , on his appointment as CEO in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2007">2007</TIMEX3> , said : ` ` I promise to focus like a laser on safe and reliable operations . ''
That followed another fatal accident at a BP refinery in Texas City in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2005">2005</TIMEX3> , as well as a hushed - up blowout in Azerbaijan in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> .
So the best operators , focusing laser - like on safety , caused the worst offshore oil spill in US history .
You can see the problem .
But how did we get here ?
The world runs on oil , a point made most succinctly by George W Bush of all people , when he described the US 's '' addiction to oil . ''
That addiction takes us to the ends of the Earth and the bottom of the ocean in search of the next fix .
Drilling in deep oceans for oil and gas is one symptom , from Brazil 's massive pre - salt reserves to the west of Shetland .
The filthy squeezing of the black gold from the tar sands of Canada is another , as is the global surge is fracking of oil shales , another dirty business .
Surely the higher risks and impacts involved in strangling the dregs of oil and gas out of the Earth would make other , renewable , options preferable ?

No , because the costs of the euphemistically dubbed ` ` unconventional '' sources of fossil fuel are not borne by those who produce or consume them .
The only long - term answer is to wean ourselves off oil before the post - peak trouble really starts .
It is not easy .
It 's amazing stuff : energy - dense and easily transported .
But alternatives exist , from electric vehicles to biofuels to fuels generated from sunlight .
These need investment , but would we really rather spend billions on clean - up operations and lawyers ?
