BP oil spill : Shares fall further <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-06-02">Today</TIMEX3> 's losses mean that BP 's market value has plunged by nearly # 45bn , or 36 % , since the Deepwater Horizon rig caught fire and sank in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2010-04">April</TIMEX3>
The pressure is mounting on the BP chief executive Tony Hayward after the Gulf of Mexico oil spill .
Photograph : Suzanne Plunkett\/Reuters Another # 2.4 bn was wiped off the value of BP when trading began in London <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010-06-02">today</TIMEX3> , as investors continued to fear that the company 's management may not survive the Gulf of Mexico disaster .
BP shares fell 3 % at the start of the trading session , sending its shares down to 417p , despite reports that the oil giant is promising investors that it will maintain its $ 10bn -LRB-
# 6.82 bn -RRB- annual dividend payout .
<TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-06-02">Today</TIMEX3> 's losses mean that BP 's market value has plunged by nearly # 45bn , or 36 % , since the Deepwater Horizon rig caught fire and sank in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010-04">April</TIMEX3> .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2010-06-01">Tuesday</TIMEX3> its shares shed 13 % following the company 's failure to block the well that is leaking tens of thousands of barrels of oil into the sea off the coast of Louisiana .
The failure of the ` ` top kill '' operation in which 30,000 barrels of mud were pumped into the well <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P3D" mod="MORE_THAN">over three days</TIMEX3> means oil is likely to keep leaking until a relief well is dug and BP can pump concrete into the well shaft .
This could take until <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2010-08" mod="START">the start of August</TIMEX3> , well into the hurricane season .
City experts are <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> speculating that BP could soon find itself fending off predators .
City commentator David Buik of BGC Partners pointed out that the plunge in BP 's value will have been felt in pension pots across the country , and questioned whether the company 's management will survive .
` ` Tony Hayward has been an excellent CEO until this disaster and would appear to have been unlucky .
However the buck sticks with the man at the top .
If BP 's share price continues to fall , it could become a takeover target .
There are so many imponderables over whether its liabilities would be capped or not . ''
Hayward will tell institutional investors <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2010-W22">this week</TIMEX3> that BP 's annual dividend will not be cut , according to a report in the Times , despite the rising cost of the Deepwater Horizon disaster .
The BP dividend was worth $ 10bn <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2009">last year</TIMEX3> , about a sixth of the overall FTSE 100 dividend payout to shareholders .
The damage to BP 's market capitalization dwarfs the $ 1bn cost , to date , of the clean - up operation .
These costs will continue to stack up until the oil leak is finally stopped , after which BP will face compensation claims and possible fines from the US government .
Some City analysts argue that traders have over - reacted by driving BP 's share price so low .
Gordon Gray and James Evan of Collins Stewart said <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2010-06-02">today</TIMEX3> that BP <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> looks undervalued versus its peers in the oil sector , unless the final cost of the liability reaches $ 40bn .
` ` We can not say with any confidence that an ultimate liability of this order of magnitude is not within the realms of possibility , '' they said , in a research note titled ` ` Value in the shares ?
It 's not possible to say with confidence . ''
President Obama announced a moratorium on certain off - shore drilling projects after the Deepwater Horizon explosion .
Some commentators believe oil companies may find it harder to extract oil from sites far below the surface , as every one of BP 's efforts to stop the flow of oil into the sea has failed .
