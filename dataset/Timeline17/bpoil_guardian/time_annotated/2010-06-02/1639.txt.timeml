Photograph : Ho\/Reuters The future of BP was in doubt <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="TIME" value="2010-06-01TNI">last night</TIMEX3> after the US government launched a criminal investigation into the Gulf of Mexico disaster , the worst oil spill in American history .
US attorney general , Eric Holder , confirmed that a criminal and civil investigation had been opened , sending BP 's shares down further before close of trading in the US .
The shares fell 13 % on the FTSE <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-06-02">today</TIMEX3> , wiping # 12bn off the company 's value .
One stockbroker , Arbuthnot , captured the gloomy mood at the company , saying the disaster ` ` has a real possibility of breaking the company '' .
Though Holder did not specify which companies would be in the crosshairs of the investigation , the actions of BP are likely to come under close scrutiny .
` ` We will closely examine the actions of those involved in the spill .
If we find evidence of illegal behavior , we will be extremely forceful in our response , '' Holder said .
He added that ` ` nothing is off the table at this point '' on the range of charges prosecutors could pursue , including straightforward criminal charges if they find false statements were made .
BP said it would co - operate fully with any investigation .
` ` As our review expands in the days ahead , we will be meticulous , we will be comprehensive , and we will be aggressive , '' Holder told reporters <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-06-01">yesterday</TIMEX3> .
` ` We will not rest until justice is done . ''
BP 's dramatic shares slump sparked a wider plunge on the FTSE 100 Index <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010-06-01">yesterday</TIMEX3> .
The company is a major constituent of the FTSE , accounting for around 7 % of the entire index , meaning that each 10p change in its share price moves the FTSE 100 by nearly 9 points .
Its stock market misery also spells bad news for many of Britain 's pension funds , which invest heavily in BP shares .
So far the group has lost around a third of its market value some # 40bn since being thrown into turmoil after the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded and sank on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">20 April</TIMEX3> , killing 11 workers .
After <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P6W">six weeks</TIMEX3> of failures to block the well or divert the oil , BP is <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> using robotic machines to cut into the twisted pipes of the well .
Engineers are trying to break away the broken riser pipe , and then position a cap over the well 's opening .
But even if this succeeds , it will temporarily increase the flow of an already huge leak by 20 % at least 380,000 litres more <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> .
