Gulf oil spill ` five times ' larger than estimated US coastguard says 5,000 barrels <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> of oil are spewing from a well beneath site of the Deepwater Horizon rig explosion <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-04-29">Thursday</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-04-29">29 April 2010</TIMEX3> 09.28
BST Five times more oil <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> than previously believed is spewing into the Gulf of Mexico from the blown - out well of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig , the US coastguard has said .
Coastguard Rear Admiral Mary Landry said National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration -LRB-
NOAA -RRB-
experts <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> estimate that 5,000 barrels <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> of oil are spilling into the gulf far more than the previous estimate of 1,000 barrels <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> .
Robot submarines have so far failed to shut off the flow , 1,500 m -LRB- 5,000 ft -RRB- below the surface , but the coastguard said a test burn on an isolated area of the spill was successful .
The revision came after a new leak was discovered and strong winds were forecast which NOAA said would push the oil towards the US shoreline .
However Doug Suttle , chief operating officer for BP , disputed the new estimates <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2010-04-28">yesterday</TIMEX3> , pointing to a diagram that plotted the leaks and saying he did not believe the amount of oil spilling into the water was higher than earlier approximations .
Landry stuck to the NOAA estimate and said it was based on aerial surveys , study of the trajectory of the oil slick and other factors .
Landry added that the US president , Barack Obama , had been briefed on the revised estimate , and said the government had offered to have the defense department help contain the spill and protect the US shoreline and wildlife .
Both Landry and BP said the first test burn had been successful , although neither gave any indication as to when further burns were planned .
Crews had planned to use a 150 m fire - resistant boom to collect several thousand gallons of the thickest oil on the surface , tow it to a remote area , set it on fire , and allow it to burn for <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="PT1H">about an hour</TIMEX3> .
When the flames go out hardened tar is left in the water , which can be removed using nets or skimmers .
The oil spill response team had recovered 16,311 barrels -LRB- 2.5 m litres -RRB- of an oil - water mix , and 69 response vessels were being used , the company added .
` ` We are attacking this spill on all fronts , bringing into play all and any resources and advanced technologies we believe can help , '' said Tony Hayward , BP chief executive .
` ` Our action plan is safety - focused , multi - layered and has the full resources of the BP Group behind it . ''
He added : ` ` The scale of the surface response is truly unprecedented , both for BP and for the oil industry . ''
BP said it had begun preparations to drill a relief well , approximately half a mile from the main well , however NOAA said this would not be complete for <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DURATION" value="PXM">several months</TIMEX3> .
NOAA said workers had finished fabricating the containment chamber of a ` ` collection dome '' which would be used to collect oil as it escaped from the well .
` ` Work will <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> begin on the piping system that brings the oil to the surface for collection ; this method has never been tried at this depth before , '' the organization said .
It said evaluations were under way to assess the damage caused by the oil to fish , marine mammals and sensitive resources , and warned the spill was on the move .
` ` Winds are forecast to become strong -LRB- 20 + knots -RRB- and blow from the south - east starting <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2010-04-30">tomorrow</TIMEX3> and continuing through <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2010-W16-WE">the weekend</TIMEX3> , which will continue to push surface oil towards shore , '' NOAA said .
BP said costs for containing the spill were running at $ 6 m -LRB- # 3.9 m -RRB- <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> , and it would spend a further $ 100 m drilling the relief well .
Industry officials say replacing the Deepwater Horizon , which was owned by Transocean Ltd but operated by BP , would cost up to $ 700 m .
