Company increases estimate from the Deepwater Horizon explosion by $ 7.7 bn <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010-11-02">Tuesday</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-11-02">2 November 2010</TIMEX3> 08.06
GMT A sea turtle covered in oil from the Deepwater Horizon disaster Photograph : Lee Celano\/reuters BP said <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-11-02">today</TIMEX3> it expects the cost of the Deepwater Horizon oil disaster to be $ 7.7 bn -LRB- # 4.8 bn -RRB- bigger than previously thought , pushing the total bill to nearly $ 40bn .
The oil giant announced the new charge to cover the cost of the Gulf of Mexico spill alongside its financial results for <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-Q3">the third quarter</TIMEX3> of the year .
It blamed the delays that dogged its attempts to seal the leak , along with higher clean - up costs and legal fees .
The new charge knocked BP 's pre - tax profits for <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010-Q3">the third quarter of 2010</TIMEX3> down to $ 1.8 bn , compared with $ 4.98 bn <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2009-Q3">a year ago</TIMEX3> .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2010-07" mod="END">late July</TIMEX3> BP set aside $ 32.2 bn to cover the cost of the clean - up , more than the City had expected , a move which pushed the company into a record loss of $ 17bn for <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2010-Q2">the second quarter of 2010</TIMEX3> .
At that time , though , the Macondo well was still leaking oil into the ocean , and was only finally shut off in mid - <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2010-09">September</TIMEX3> .
Richard Hunter , head of UK equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers , said the additional $ 7.7 bn provision was ` ` a stark reminder that the fallout from the spill will follow BP for some considerable time to come '' .
The final cost of one of the worst environmental disasters ever could climb further .
BP said that the total charge of $ 39.9 bn was its ` ` <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> best estimate of those costs that can be reliably measured at this time '' .
So far , BP has actually paid $ 11.6 bn in total costs since the incident , but still faces ongoing clean - up charges , compensation claims , and probably a multi - billion dollar fine from the US government .
BP owned 65 % of the Macondo well with two partners owning the remainder Anadarko Petroleum with 25 % , and Mitsui with 10 % .
BP has billed Anadarko and Mitsui a total of $ 4.29 bn , but admitted that both companies are ` ` withholding payment in light of the investigations surrounding the incident '' .
Separately , Mitsui revealed <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2010-11-02">today</TIMEX3> it had received a $ 1.9 bn bill from BP to cover some of the clean - up costs of the spill .
When the costs of the oil spill were excluded , BP 's operating profits for <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2010-Q4">the quarter</TIMEX3> were 18 % higher than <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2009-Q4">a year ago</TIMEX3> at $ 5.5 bn .
Chief executive Bob Dudley , in his first results announcement since taking over from Tony Hayward , said they showed BP was ` ` on track '' to recover from the disaster .
` ` This strong operating performance shows the determination of everyone at BP to move the company forward and rebuild confidence after the terrible events of <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DURATION" value="P6M">the past six months</TIMEX3> , '' Dudley said .
BP also said that it would reconsider its <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> dividend freeze in <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DATE" value="2011-02">February 2011</TIMEX3> .
Richard Griffith , analyst at Evolution Securities , said BP 's underlying performance was better than expected .
Shares in BP rose by 1.5 % <TIMEX3 tid="t36" type="TIME" value="2010-11-02TMO">this morning</TIMEX3> to 430p , around a third lower than their value before the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded in <TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="DATE" value="2010-04">April</TIMEX3> .
