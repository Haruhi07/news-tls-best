Gulf oil spill at Deepwater Horizon threatens $ 8bn clean - up and an ecological oil slick disaster for the US
This was the catastrophe that BP insisted could never happen .
<TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> they call it ` unprecedented ' <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2009-05">Twelve months ago</TIMEX3> BP dismissed the possibility that a catastrophic accident could happen at its offshore rig Deepwater Horizon , it emerged <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-05-01">yesterday</TIMEX3> .
An exploration plan and environmental impact analysis for the well , produced by the company in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3> , concluded that it was virtually impossible for there to be a giant crude oil spill from it .
<TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> City experts say that the accident could cost the company up to $ 8bn -LRB- # 5.23 bn -RRB- to clear up the slick .
The US Coast Guard has estimated that 6 m litres of oil has already spilled into the waters of the Gulf of Mexico since an explosion destroyed the rig on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">20 April</TIMEX3> , killing 11 workers .
A further 800,000 litres is thought to be pouring from the stricken well <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EVERY">every day</TIMEX3> , threatening to turn the accident into the worst US oil disaster since the Exxon Valdez in Alaska in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="1989">1989</TIMEX3> .
<TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2010-05-01">Yesterday</TIMEX3> , a slick 130 miles long and 70 miles wide was being swept towards the ecologically vulnerable coastlines of Louisiana and Mississippi .
Yet BP 's plan for the Deepwater Horizon well , filed with the federal Minerals Management Service , repeatedly said that it was ` ` unlikely that an accidental surface or subsurface oil spill would occur from the proposed activities '' .
The company conceded that a spill would have an impact on beaches , wildlife refuges and wilderness areas , but argued that ` ` due to the distance to shore -LRB- 48 miles -RRB- and the response capabilities that would be implemented , no significant adverse impacts are expected '' .
The revelation that BP had apparently underestimated the dangers posed by the rig brought outraged responses from local activists .
` ` If you 're going to be drilling in 5,000 ft of water for oil , you should have the ability to control what you 're doing , '' said Robert Wiygul , an Ocean Springs , Mississippi - based environmental lawyer .
This point was backed by Chris Frid , professor of marine biology at Liverpool University .
` ` The way to deal with an accident like this is to hit the oil with dispersants as soon as it starts bubbling up to the surface , '' he said .
` ` Once it has been in the sea for <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="PXD">a few days</TIMEX3> , it becomes more difficult to break up into small particles that can then be degraded by bacteria .
` ` But that has not happened .
Either insufficient dispersants were available or there was a lack of co - ordination among those dealing with the spillage .
Either way , there has been a ludicrous delay . ''
For its part , BP has claimed that the events leading to the rig 's destruction had no parallel .
` ` The sort of occurrence a blowout at this depth is clearly unprecedented , '' said a spokesman .
Crews have struggled for days without success to activate the well 's underwater shut - off valve using remotely operated vehicles .
They also are drilling a relief well in hopes of injecting mud and concrete to seal off the leak , but that could take <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="P3M">three months</TIMEX3> .
The prospect of oil pouring into the gulf for such a period could have horrifying effects on wildlife , added Frid .
` ` That part of the gulf 's coastline consists of a sedimentary shore with lots of muddy inlets .
The oil will penetrate into the mud , and because it contains no oxygen the oil will not biodegrade .
For generations , any disturbance of the sediment will bring oil back to the surface and that will happen over a very large area . ''
Similar fears were also stressed by Jane Lubchenco , head of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , after she took part in a conference call with the governors of the gulf states on <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2010-04-30">Friday</TIMEX3> .
` ` There is very deep concern about what is happening , '' she added .
To date , most efforts to deal with the growing slick have failed .
Rough seas and strong winds have blocked efforts to burn off the oil or hold it in check with inflatable booms strung along the coast .
Louisiana officials have opened gates in the Mississippi river in the hope that a flood of fresh water would drive oil away from the coast , but the high winds also thwarted that plan .
Meanwhile the Pentagon has deployed two C-130 cargo planes to spray chemicals on the oil , while the Louisiana National Guard has been deployed to help local communities .
The cost of dealing with the Deepwater Horizon oil spill could reach up to $ 12.5 bn , according to City analysts , with BP 's share totalling $ 8bn .
Neil McMahon of Bernstein Research estimated a total of $ 7.5 bn for the clean - up and subsequent damages , with another $ 5bn for losses suffered by the fishing and tourist industries in the area .
BP owns 65 % of the licence , so would pay the bulk of this figure .
BP is <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> spending $ 6 m <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> on the clean - up but this is likely to rise to at least $ 10 m <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> , according to Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch analysts , and could go on for <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DURATION" value="P6M">six months</TIMEX3> .
On top of that , the company is drilling two intervention wells at a total cost of about $ 300 m .
