Photograph : Gerald Herbert\/AP Insurers Amlin and Hiscox have been hit by catastrophe claims and losses related to the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
` ` We had the UK <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-WI">winter</TIMEX3> freeze and windstorm Xynthia in Europe , we had volcanic ash and we had Deepwater Horizon it was an astonishing <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-H1">first half</TIMEX3> , '' said Robert Hiscox , chairman of the eponymous insurer .
` ` Mother Nature has shown how capricious she can be . ''
It was the worst ever <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-H1">first half</TIMEX3> for natural disasters , according to reinsurer Munich Re .
Following an uneventful <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3> , the industry was hit hard by the Chilean earthquake in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-02">February</TIMEX3> the largest insured natural disaster outside the US for <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="PXY">many years</TIMEX3> and windstorm Xynthia , which tore through France in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010-03" mod="START">early March</TIMEX3> .
Amlin had net claims of $ 167.6 m -LRB- # 108 m -RRB- from the Chilean earthquake , out of total industry losses of $ 8bn , plus $ 2 m from Xynthia , compared with industry losses of $ 3.4 bn .
It was more heavily exposed to hailstorms in Australia , which resulted in claims of $ 18 m , out of an industry total of $ 920 m .
Bermuda - based Hiscox estimates its bill for the Chilean earthquake and Xynthia will reach # 100 m .
Its retail arm , which sells home insurance direct to consumers , was hit by <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2010-WI">the winter</TIMEX3> freeze in the UK at the start of the year and has raised premiums by 4 % .
Moreover both insurers had exposure to the BP oil spill which cost Amlin $ 15 m and Hiscox about # 10 m .
Despite a 56 % increase in gross written premium , Amlin 's profit before tax dropped # 70 m from <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2009-WI">a year ago</TIMEX3> to # 107.6 m in the first <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="P6M">six months</TIMEX3> of the year .
Hiscox reported a # 44 m fall in profits to # 97.2 m , with its gross written premiums little changed at # 904.3 m.
The oil spill reversed the fall in energy insurance rates lifting them by up to 20 % , in recognition of the increased risks .
The worst spill in American history has affected insurance rates for deepwater drilling around the world and has also had a knock - on effect on marine liability rates because of potential pollution , said Amlin 's chief executive Charles Philipps .
The disaster has also fuelled demand for insurance .
` ` A lot more people want to buy .
Regulators are demanding that if companies are drilling in the Gulf they get X amount of insurance , '' said Hiscox .
He was confident about the future , even though experts are expecting a worse - than - usual hurricane season <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2010">this year</TIMEX3> .
Unlike banks faced with black holes in their finances , insurers tend to bounce back quickly after a big disaster because they can bump up their prices .
` ` If it 's really big and hairy , a feast follows the famine , '' he said .
He noted that the worst year for the insurance industry , <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2005">2005</TIMEX3> , when four hurricanes hit America , was followed by <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DURATION" value="PXY">several years</TIMEX3> of staggering profits .
Amlin cheered investors by raising its interim dividend by 10.8 % to 7.2 p a share while Hiscox increased its dividend by 11 % to 5p .
