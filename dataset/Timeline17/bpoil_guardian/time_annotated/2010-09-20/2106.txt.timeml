The US government has declared the blown - out BP well in the Gulf of Mexico , which caused the biggest oil spill in American history , ` ` effectively dead '' after a final plug of cement was pumped in .
<TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P5M">Five months</TIMEX3> after the explosion that killed 11 workers on the Deepwater Horizon rig and let loose millions of barrels of crude oil , the well passed a pressure test <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2010-09-19">yesterday</TIMEX3> that confirmed it was sealed about 5,000 metres below the sea bed .
` ` We can finally announce that the Macondo 252 well is effectively dead , '' said Thad Allen , the former coast guard admiral heading the government response to the spill .
Allen declared that the well ` ` poses no continuing threat to the Gulf of Mexico '' .
The spill was brought to a halt in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-07">July</TIMEX3> with a temporary cap while a relief well was completed .
That well finally reached the main shaft on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-09-16">Thursday</TIMEX3> , permitting the cement plug to be pumped in .
Barack Obama hailed the news as an ` ` important milestone '' and praised those who ` ` worked around the clock to respond to this crisis and ultimately complete this challenging but critical step to ensure that the well has stopped leaking for ever '' .
Obama said the government remained committed to helping communities along hundreds of miles of Gulf coast recover from the disaster .
BP is still counting the cost of the disaster .
It was forced by the US government to establish a $ 20bn compensation fund .
Nearly 70,000 people or businesses have lodged claims mostly for loss of earnings or profits .
So far about one in four have been paid although some of the recipients say with cheques far lower than their claims .
The majority come from Florida and Louisiana .
BP <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-W37">last week</TIMEX3> refused to process a claim by the state government of Alabama for $ 148 m in lost income tax revenues because workers have lost their jobs or have diminished earnings as a result of the spill .
The company is also facing about 400 lawsuits and many more are likely to be filed .
BP is estimated to have paid $ 8bn so far in clean - up costs .
It has launched a national advertising campaign that promises to make right the damage caused by the spill .
The environmental toll is still being assessed but thousands of dead birds , turtles and other wildlife have been found even if the impact is not as great as initially feared .
The debate over where the spilled oil has gone continues .
<TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-08">Last month</TIMEX3> the government said that nearly three - quarters of it had evaporated , been devoured by living organisms or scooped up .
But some scientists claim that a massive plume of oil remain in the Gulf of Mexico with some of it having settled on the sea bed .
<TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010-09" mod="START">Earlier this month</TIMEX3> , BP published its own findings into the causes of the disaster .
It accepted a partial share of the blame for the blowout but also accused a contractor , Halliburton , of sub - standard work at the well head which led to the disaster and the owner of the rig , Transocean , for the failures of the blowout preventer on the ocean floor .
The blowout preventer , a series of valves designed to stop a surge of oil and gas , is being held at a Nasa facility in New Orleans to await examination <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-10">next month</TIMEX3> .
BP 's position is widely viewed as establishing its legal strategy as it faces fines and possible prosecution over the disaster .
