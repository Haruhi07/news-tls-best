BP oil spill clean - up delayed by high winds and choppy seas Ten - foot waves as hurricane season hits Gulf of Mexico , halting tests of crucial new crude - sucking super skimmers <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010-07-05">Monday</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-07-05">5 July 2010</TIMEX3> 11.28
BST TMT Shipping Offshore 's converted super tanker , A Whale , 14 miles northwest of the BP oil spill site in the Gulf of Mexico Photograph : Lyle Ratliff\/Reuters A whale of an oil skimmer is being put through its paces tested in the Gulf of Mexico , but high wind and choppy seas due to the hurricane season means it may be longer than first hoped before officials know if it can work full - time sucking crude from the sea .
TMT , the shipping firm that owns the vessel , had hoped to test a containment boom system designed to direct greater volumes of oily water into the 12 vents or ` ` jaws '' the ship uses to suck it in , said spokesman Bob Grantham .
But choppy seas have made that impossible , and have also prevented a flotilla of smaller skimmers from working offshore along the coasts of Alabama , Mississippi and Florida .
` ` As was the case <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-07-04">yesterday</TIMEX3> , the sea state , with waves at times in excess of 10 feet , is not permitting optimal testing conditions , '' Grantham said .
The skimmers , which have been idle off the coasts since a spell of bad weather <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2010-W26">last week</TIMEX3> kicked up by Hurricane Alex , were on the water along the Louisiana coast over <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2010-W26-WE">the weekend</TIMEX3> .
Officials with the US coast guard are waiting for the weather to improve before sending them elsewhere .
` ` We ' ve got our guys out there and they 're docked and ready , but safety is a huge concern for us , especially with the smaller vessels , '' said Courtnee Ferguson , a of the Joint Information Command in Mobile , Alabama .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2010-07-04">Sunday</TIMEX3> , huge barges used to collect oil from skimming vessels were parked at the mouth of Mobile Bay , waiting for waves to subside offshore .
The <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> spate of bad weather is likely to last well into <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2010-W28">next week</TIMEX3> .
On the shore , beach clean - up crews were making progress on new oil that washed up because of the high tides generated by <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2010-W26">last week</TIMEX3> 's bad weather .
In Grand Isle , Louisiana , about 800 people were removing tar balls and liquid oil from seven miles of beach , coast guard commander .
` ` In <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> or two , you would n't be able to tell the oil was even there , '' he said .
By <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2010-06-30">Wednesday</TIMEX3> , Ogrydziak said they should have a machine on the beach that washes sand where the oil washed ashore .
Crews have also been working to put containment booms thrown around by the storms back into place , he said .
So far , weather has not slowed drilling on two relief wells that could be the best hope of finally plugging what has become the worst oil leak in Gulf history .
BP officials have said they 're running slightly ahead of schedule on the drilling , but expect weather or other delays .
Early to mid - <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2010-08">August</TIMEX3> is still the estimate for the completion of the drilling .
The capture and burning of oil and gas at the site of the leaking well has continued without interruption from the weather .
But the choppy seas have delayed the operation of another vessel that officials say will roughly double the amount of oil being collected or burned .
