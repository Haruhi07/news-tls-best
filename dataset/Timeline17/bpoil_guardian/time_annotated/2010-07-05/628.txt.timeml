Features The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has so far cost BP $ 3.12 bn -LRB- # 2bn
-RRB- , the company said <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="TIME" value="2010-07-05TMO">this morning</TIMEX3> as it emerged that the oil giant is demanding that its partners in the well pick up at least part of the bill .
<TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-06">Last month</TIMEX3> , BP sent out demands for almost $ 400 m to Anadarko and Japan 's Mitsui Oil Exploration Company , both of whom are minority shareholders in the well .
That is equivalent to 40 % of the $ 1bn BP said it spent in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-05">May</TIMEX3> .
Anadarko owns 25 % of the well and Mitsui has 10 % .
Details of the demands were contained in documents released by a Senate subcommittee <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010-W26">last week</TIMEX3> .
BP is demanding payment within <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P30D">30 days</TIMEX3> , meaning that the two companies have roughly until <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-W26-WE">the weekend</TIMEX3> to pay up .
Anadarko , however , has refused to accept any blame for the disaster .
<TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-06">Last month</TIMEX3> its chairman and chief executive , Jim Hackett , said BP 's actions probably amounted to ` ` gross negligence or wilful misconduct '' .
If proved in court , that could allow Anadarko to escape its responsibilities under its joint operating agreement .
Mitsui , meanwhile , has said it is too early to conclude what happened on the Deepwater Horizon .
News that BP is trying to recoup some of its losses comes as the company updated investors on <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="TIME" value="2010-07-05TMO">Monday morning</TIMEX3> about the scale of the salvage and clean - up exercise .
Since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">20 April</TIMEX3> , the cost of the response to date amounts to approximately $ 3.12 bn , including the cost of the spill response , containment ,
relief well drilling , grants to the Gulf states , claims paid , and federal costs .
The news follows BP 's agreement on <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2011-06-16">16 June</TIMEX3> to put $ 20bn into a special clean - up fund for the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster after company executives met Barack Obama .
Approximately 44,500 personnel , more than 6,563 vessels and some 113 aircraft are <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> engaged in the response effort .
BP said on <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2010-07-05">Monday</TIMEX3> that almost 95,000 claims for compensation have been submitted and more than 47,000 payments have been made , totalling almost $ 147 m .
BP said two containment systems continue to collect oil and gas flowing from the Deepwater Horizon 's
failed blow - out preventer -LRB- BOP -RRB- and transport them to vessels on the surface .
The first cap , installed on <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2010-06-03">3 June</TIMEX3> , takes oil and gas to the Discoverer Enterprise where oil is collected and gas flared .
The second system , which began operations on <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2010-06-16">16 June</TIMEX3> , takes oil and gas to the Q4000 vessel on the surface where both oil and gas are flared .
As of <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2010-07-03">3 July</TIMEX3> , a total of approximately 25,198 barrels of oil were collected or flared by the two systems and 57.0 m cubic feet of gas were flared .
To date , the total volume of oil collected or flared by the containment systems is approximately 585,400 barrels .
Preparations continue for the next step in containment operations , BP added , but work on a first floating riser containment system designed to allow more rapid disconnection and reconnection of the system thereby reducing the time that collection is halted by inclement weather has been delayed by heightened sea states caused by Hurricane Alex as it passed through the Gulf of Mexico .
It is <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> anticipated that the first floating riser system will be available to begin operations towards the end of the week , BP said .
Plans also are being developed for additional containment capacity and flexibility .
These are <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> anticipated to begin operations around mid - to - <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2010-07" mod="END">late July</TIMEX3> .
Work on the first relief well , which started <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="2010-05-02">2 May</TIMEX3> , continues .
The well reached a depth of 17,725 feet on <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="2010-07-04">4 July</TIMEX3> .
The second relief well , which started <TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="DATE" value="2010-05-16">16 May</TIMEX3> , has <TIMEX3 tid="t36" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> reached 13,871 feet .
Both wells are still estimated to take <TIMEX3 tid="t37" type="DURATION" value="P3M" mod="APPROX">approximately three months</TIMEX3> to complete from the start of drilling .
Operations to skim oil from the surface of the water were suspended for <TIMEX3 tid="t38" type="DURATION" value="P3D" mod="APPROX">approximately three days</TIMEX3> because of Hurricane Alex .
To date , these operations have recovered , in total , approximately 673,497 barrels of oily liquid .
In addition , a total of 275 controlled burns have been carried out to date , removing an estimated 238,000 barrels of oil from the sea 's surface .
The total length of containment boom deployed as part of efforts to prevent oil from reaching the coast is <TIMEX3 tid="t39" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> almost 2.9 m feet .
