Susan Walsh\/AP The battle to bring BP to account for the Gulf of Mexico disaster intensified as senior politicians in the US gathered to co - ordinate their approach to the oil spill , hours after beleaguered chief executive Tony Hayward was summoned to Washington .
Nancy Pelosi , speaker of the House of Representatives , met with seven committee chairmen to discuss how to proceed in the fight with ` big oil ' .
Following the meeting , she declared that Congress will write and pass legislation by <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-08">August</TIMEX3> that addresses the consequences of the Deepwater Horizon explosion on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-04-20">20 April</TIMEX3> .
Dubbed the ` ` spill bill '' , this could include new controls on off - shore drilling , higher fines for spillages , and more compensation for those affected .
Pelosi 's meeting was seen as an attempt to bring more order to the Democratic party 's response to the ongoing catastrophe .
At least fifteen house and Senate committees have held , or are planning , hearings into the disaster .
Four separate meetings are scheduled to take place <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-06-09">today</TIMEX3> alone .
This has led to fears of a turf war , as politicians scrabble to be seen to be taking a tough line on BP ahead of <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010-FA">this autumn</TIMEX3> 's mid - term elections .
` ` You have all of the house , a third of the Senate and a very motivated White House eager to look responsive , '' Kevin Book , an analyst with ClearView Energy Partners , told Bloomberg , flagging up how many lawmakers face re - election .

But the scale of the investigations into the Deepwater Horizon disaster has also yielded benefits .
For example , the energy and commerce committee has already held five hearings and obtained a slew of documents from the companies involved with the Deepwater drilling .
The house select committee on energy independence and global warming forced BP to release live footage of the leak from its robot submarines .
And the Senate committee on energy and natural resources exposed rifts between BP , rig operator Transocean and contractor Halliburton , when senior executives all tried to pin the blame on each other .
<TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-06-08">Tuesday</TIMEX3> 's meeting also gave a taste of the fury that many in Washington feel against BP .
Edward Markey , chairman of the house energy and environment subcommittee , claimed that BP was ` ` either lying or they are grossly incompetent '' as he castigated the company for underestimating the amount of oil spewing into the ocean following the Deepwater Horizon explosion .
Up to <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> , BP has been represented at many of these hearings by Lamar McKay , its head of American operations .
That will change <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-W24">next week</TIMEX3> , though , when Hayward appears before the energy and commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations .
It wrote to Hayward <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2010-06-08">yesterday</TIMEX3> , inviting him and another BP employee to a hearing <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2010-06-10">next Thursday</TIMEX3> .
The subcommittee will grill Hayward about the causes of the Deepwater Horizon rig explosion .
` ` The subcommittee anticipates that its members may have questions requiring technical knowledge of the Deepwater Horizon rig operations , well design , and safety measures and , accordingly , we ask that you be accompanied by a BP employee or official with sufficient knowledge to answer these questions under oath , '' said the committee in a letter to Hayward released <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="TIME" value="2010-06-08TNI">last night</TIMEX3> .
<TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2010-W23" mod="START">Earlier this week</TIMEX3> Democratic congressman Anthony Weiner showed how little respect many on Capitol Hill have for BP .
He told TV viewers that the company was essentially lying about the disaster : ` ` Whenever you hear someone with a British accent talking about this on behalf of British Petroleum they are not telling you the truth .
That 's the bottom - line , '' Weiner said .
There is also evidence that the sheer amount of scrutiny may be overwhelming BP .
Politicians in Mississippi had invited BP , Transocean and Halliburton to appear at a hearing at its state capital <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2010-W23">this week</TIMEX3> , but the three companies declined .
BP reportedly explained that its key officials would be tied up in Washington instead .
BP 's shares fell another 3.7 % <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2010-06-09">today</TIMEX3> to 393p , on fresh fears that the company will be forced to scrap its dividend .
They have <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> lost almost 40 % of their value since the Deepwater rig exploded , wiping nearly # 50bn off BP 's market capitalization .
<TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2010-06-09" mod="END">Later today</TIMEX3> the house transportation and infrastructure committee will hold a hearing called Liability and Financial Responsibility for Oil Spills under the Oil Pollution Act of <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="1990">1990</TIMEX3> and Related Statutes .
The house science and technology committee will discuss the need for better methods to fight oil spills , at a meeting titled Deluge of Oil Highlights Research and Technology Needs for Oil Recovery and Effective Cleanup of Oil Spills .
The house energy and commerce committee will probe the <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> situation in the Gulf of Mexico at a hearing called Beneath the Surface of the BP Spill : What 's Happening <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> , What 's Needed Next .
And the Senate environment and public works committee will examine The Big Oil Bailout Prevention Liability Act of <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3> , a bill under which the maximum cap for damages would be raised to $ 10bn -LRB-
# 6.9 bn -RRB- from $ 75 m .
