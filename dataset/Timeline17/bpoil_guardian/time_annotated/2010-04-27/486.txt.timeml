Photograph : Gerald Herbert\/AP BP has smashed City forecasts with a 135 % jump in profits , thanks to rising oil prices .
The energy giant reported profits of $ 5.6 bn -LRB- # 3.6 bn -RRB- in the first <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="P3M">three months</TIMEX3> of <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3> , up from $ 2.4 bn <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2009">a year ago</TIMEX3> .
Analysts had expected a figure of around $ 4.8 bn on a replacement cost profit basis , which strips out fluctuations in the value of oil inventories .
The unexpectedly large jump in earnings was mainly thanks to BP 's exploration and production arm , which benefited from oil prices of up to $ 84 a barrel during <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2010-Q2">the quarter</TIMEX3> .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2009" mod="START">early 2009</TIMEX3> the oil price fell below $ 33 a barrel .
The rally over <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2009">the last year</TIMEX3> has helped oil producers , but hurt motorists who are <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> facing record petrol prices at the pumps .
BP 's strong performance was overshadowed by the explosion <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2010-W16">last week</TIMEX3> at a drilling rig in the Gulf of Mexico .
Eleven people are missing and presumed dead after Deepwater Horizon , hired by BP and owned by US firm Transocean , caught fire and sank .
Around 1,000 barrels of oil are still gushing from the site into the sea <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EACH">each day</TIMEX3> .
BP said it was committed to doing everything in its power to contain the environmental consequences of America 's worst offshore rig disaster in <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DURATION" value="P40Y">40 years</TIMEX3> .
There are <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> 1,000 people involved in efforts to stop two separate leaks , and deal with the growing oil spill , including BP workers and the US Coast Guard .
` ` The safety of the people working offshore is our top priority and the improved weather has created better conditions for our response , '' said BP chief executive Tony Hayward in a statement <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="TIME" value="2010-04-27TMO">this morning</TIMEX3> .
` ` This , combined with the light , thin oil we are dealing with has further increased our confidence that we can tackle this spill offshore . ''
BP is moving two rigs to the site to drill relief wells , which should help to shut the leak down .
Four underwater robots have also been deployed to try to activate a cut - off valve which failed to engage before the rig exploded <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">last Tuesday</TIMEX3> .
