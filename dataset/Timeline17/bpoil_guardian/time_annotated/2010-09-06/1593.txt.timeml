BP , battered but still standing , faces up to its post - oil spill future What executives are labeling ` Future BP ' will be a much smaller company shorn of much of its presence around the world <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-09-06">Monday</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-09-06">6 September 2010</TIMEX3> 20.27 BST A sign at a BP petrol station is reflected in raindrops .
Photograph : Reuters BP is still standing , but the Gulf of Mexico oil spill has changed the company forever .
It could have been far worse .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-06">June</TIMEX3> , some City analysts doubted whether BP could survive the crisis .
Shares had plunged by more than half .
Within the space of <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="PXW">a few weeks</TIMEX3> , the official estimate of the amount of oil flowing into the Gulf had increased from 5,000 barrels to anywhere between 35,000 and 60,000 barrels per day .
The company 's repeated attempts to stop the flow had failed and <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010-08">August</TIMEX3> the earliest the first relief well could be drilled seemed a lifetime away .
The chief executive , Tony Hayward who has since resigned and BP 's chairman were summoned to meet Barack Obama at the White House .
They were forced to scrap plans to pay shareholders a dividend and instead to set aside $ 20bn to pay damages to those affected .
While the battle to stop the leak is over , the legal battle is only just beginning .
BP will fight tooth and nail against accusations that it was grossly negligent .
If the charge stands , it faces fines of up to $ 21bn .
BP would n't be able to pass off other costs , such as the clean - up and damages , to its partners .
With investigations by the Department of Justice , among others , only just beginning , US lawyers say it will take years to decide who was to blame for the accident and the full level of BP 's liabilities .
The company is already selling $ 30bn worth of assets to meet its costs from the spill so far .
What executives are labeling ` ` Future BP '' will be a much smaller company shorn of much of its presence around the world .
If investigations decide it has been grossly negligent , many more asset sales will be necessary .
BP argues that whatever happens , it is in the US 's interests that it survives so it can meet all its liabilities .
But it may be some time before it can afford to resume paying bumper dividends , which normally make up more than one - tenth of all payouts by UK companies .
