BP oil spill : US scientist retracts assurances over success of cleanup NOAA 's Bill Lehr says three - quarters of the oil that gushed from the Deepwater Horizon rig is still in the Gulf environment while scientists identify 22 - mile plume in ocean depths Bill Lehr , a senior scientist at the NOAA , appeared before Congress to repudiate an earlier report he wrote , which suggested the majority of the oil had been captured .
Photograph : Chip Somodevilla\/Getty Images White House claims that the worst of the BP oil spill was over were undermined <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2010-08-18">yesterday</TIMEX3> when a senior government scientist said three - quarters of the oil was still in the Gulf environment and a research study detected a 22 - mile plume of oil in the ocean depths .
Bill Lehr , a senior scientist at the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration -LRB-
NOAA -RRB- departed from an official report from <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-W31">two weeks ago</TIMEX3> which suggested the majority of the oil had been captured or broken down .
` ` I would say most of that is still in the environment , '' Lehr , the lead author of the report , told the house energy and commerce committee .

The growing evidence that the White House painted an overly optimistic picture when officials claimed <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-W31">two weeks ago</TIMEX3> the remaining oil in the Gulf was rapidly breaking down fuelled a sense of outrage in the scientific community that government agencies are hiding data and spinning the science of the oil spill .
No new oil has entered the Gulf since <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-07-15">15 July</TIMEX3> , but officials said <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010-08-18">yesterday</TIMEX3> the well is unlikely to be sealed for good until mid - <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2009-09">September</TIMEX3> .
Under questioning from the committee chair , Ed Markey , Lehr revised down the amount of oil that went into the Gulf to 4.1 m barrels , from an earlier estimate of 4.9 m , noting that 800,000 barrels were siphoned off directly from the well .
By some estimates , as much as 90 % of the oil was unaccounted for .
Lehr said 6 % was burned and 4 % was skimmed but he could not be confident of numbers for the amount collected from beaches .
The NOAA has been under fire from independent scientists and Congress for its conclusions and for failing to explain how it arrived at its calculations .
The agency has failed to respond to repeated requests from Congress to reveal its raw data and methodology .
Markey told Lehr the agency report had given the public a false sense of confidence .
` ` You should n't have released it until you knew it was right , '' he said .
` ` People want to believe that everything is OK and I think this report and the way it is being discussed is giving many people a false sense of confidence regarding the state of the Gulf , '' Markey said .
Lehr said the agency would release all supporting data in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P2M">two months</TIMEX3> .

But the impression of stonewalling has damaged the credibility of the Obama administration in the scientific community .
` ` That report was not science , '' said Ian MacDonald , an ocean scientist at Florida State University who has studied the Gulf for <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P30Y">30 years</TIMEX3> .
He accused the White House of making ` ` sweeping and largely unsupported '' claims that three - quarters of the oil in the Gulf was gone .
` ` I believe this report is misleading , '' he said .
` ` The imprint will be there in the Gulf of Mexico for the rest of my life .
It is not gone and it will not go away quickly . ''
MacDonald went on to warn of a tipping point from which the wildlife and ecosystem in the Gulf could not recover .
Meanwhile , in the Science article , experts from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute mapped a 22 - mile plume of oil droplets from BP 's well , providing the strongest evidence so far over the fate of the crude .
` ` These results indicate that efforts to book - keep where the oil went must <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> include this plume , '' said Christopher Reddy , one of the Woods Hole team .
The report also said the plume was very slow to break down by natural forces .
` ` Many people speculated that subsurface oil droplets were being easily degraded , '' said Richard Camilli , the lead author of the paper .
` ` Well , we did n't find that .
We found it was still there . ''
The scientists zig - zagged for hundreds of miles across the ocean to track the plume , taking 57,000 readings of its chemical signature during a 10 - day research voyage at <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2010-06" mod="END">the end of June</TIMEX3> .
The Woods Hole effort reinforces earlier reports from research voyages by scientists from the University of Georgia and Texas A&M University who detected the presence of deepwater plumes of oil .
<TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2010-W33">This week</TIMEX3> , University of South Florida scientists reported oil in amounts that were toxic to critical plankton on the ocean floor far east of the spill .
Those findings have not been reviewed by other scientists .
According to the Woods Hole findings , the deepwater plume is 22 miles long or about the length of Manhattan 1.2 miles wide and 650 ft high .
It noted that the plume was not made up of pure oil but included toxic oil compounds including benzene and xylene .
<TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2010-08-18">Yesterday</TIMEX3> 's testimony and the Science article put the White House and government scientific agencies increasingly out of step with independent scientists .
It also raises new questions about the administration 's decision to use nearly 2 m gallons of a chemical dispersant Corexit to break up the oil .
The NOAA chief Jane Lubchenco , herself an ocean scientist , had played down the first reports of oil in the ocean depths .
MacDonald and other scientists have accused NOAA of discouraging them from making public their findings about lingering oil in the deepwater .
A NOAA spokeswoman said <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="TIME" value="2010-08-18TNI">last night</TIMEX3> that the Woods Hole voyage was in <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2010-06" mod="END">late June</TIMEX3> , while the broken BP well was still spewing oil .
` ` It 's not necessarily an indication of where we are <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2010-08-19">today</TIMEX3> ''
she said .
A NOAA team reported <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2010-W31">two weeks ago</TIMEX3> that just over a quarter of oil remained in the Gulf as a light sheen on the surface or degraded tar balls washing ashore .
