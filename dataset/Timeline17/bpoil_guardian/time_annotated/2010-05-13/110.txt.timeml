Features BP was aware of equipment problems aboard the Deepwater Horizon rig hours before the explosion pumped millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico , a congressional hearing was told <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-05-12">yesterday</TIMEX3> .
In a second day of hearings , the House of Representatives 's energy and commerce committee said documents and company briefings suggested that BP , which owned the well ; Transocean , which owned the rig ; and Halliburton , which cemented into place the casing for the well , ignored tests in the hours before <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">the 20 April</TIMEX3> explosion that indicated faulty safety equipment .
` ` Yet it appears the companies did not suspend operations , and <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> 11 workers are dead and the gulf faces an environmental catastrophe , '' Henry Waxman , the chair of the energy and commerce committee , said , demanding to know why work was not stopped .
The committee heard testimony from oil executives suggesting multiple failures of safety systems that should have given advance warning of a blowout , or should have promptly cut off the flow of oil .
The failures included a dead battery in the blowout preventer , suggestions of a breach in the well casing , and failure in the shear ram , a device of last resort that was supposed to cut through and seal the drill pipe in the event of a blowout .
` ` Already we have uncovered at least four significant problems with the blowout preventer used on the Deepwater Horizon drill rig , '' said Bart Stupak , a Democrat from Michigan who chairs the oversight subcommittee .
The examination was far tougher on the oil companies than the Senate hearings on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010-05-11">Tuesday</TIMEX3> .
BP also faced a financial sting as the White House asked Congress to approve $ 118 m in recovery costs , to be passed on to the oil company .
While the committee accused the oil industry of failing to anticipate the dangers of offshore drilling , senators John Kerry and Joe Lieberman unveiled a climate and energy bill that for the first time will put a price on carbon and require American cuts in greenhouse gas emissions .
Kerry said he believed the oil spill would give impetus to the American Power Act .
` ` This a bill for energy independence after a devastating oil spill , a bill to hold polluters accountable , a bill for billions of dollars to create the next generation of jobs and a bill to end America 's addiction to foreign oil . ''
But after <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P8M">eight months</TIMEX3> of careful courtship of industry and political opposition , the bill has no Republican backers after Senator Lindsey Graham , a co - author , withdrew his support <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-04">last month</TIMEX3> and the immediate response from industry groups and mainstream environmental groups was guarded .
Passage of the law is seen as crucial to a global deal on climate change .
The 987 - page bill was carefully positioned to secure support from industry and moderate Republicans , making the final product far weaker than environmental organizations wanted .
In response to the oil disaster , the bill moderated its original support for offshore drilling , giving states veto power over projects in waters 75 miles from their shores .
States that go ahead will be able to keep a bigger share , 37 % , of federal revenues from drilling .

Otherwise the bill calls for 12 nuclear plants and sets aside $ 2bn for research into clean coal .
Greenpeace condemned it as a ` ` dirty energy bailout '' , with director Phil Radford adding : ` ` It seems that after <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> and a half wrangling , the only people who can be happy with this bill are the fossil fuel industry lobbyists . ''
The bill aims for a 17 % cut in emissions over 2005 levels , the same weak target enshrined in a bill passed by the House in <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2009-06">June last year</TIMEX3> .
But the Senate version would apply to a smaller share of the US economy .
Heavy industries would not be required to cut emissions until <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3> .
The bill would stop the Environmental Protection Agency regulating greenhouse gases and would scrap region cap and trade systems <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> underway in two dozen states and Canadian provinces .

The original said that Halliburton ` ` made the cement casing '' for the well .
This has been corrected .
