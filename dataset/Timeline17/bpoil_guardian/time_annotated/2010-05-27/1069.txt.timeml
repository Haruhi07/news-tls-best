BP will ` pay every dime owed ' for Gulf oil spill , Obama warns Oil spill caused by explosion of Deepwater Horizon rig surpasses Exxon Valdez as worst slick in US history <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-05-27">Thursday</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-05-27">27
May 2010</TIMEX3> 23.18 BST A vast oil slick caused by the explosion of BP 's Deepwater Horizon rig in the Gulf of Mexico has become the worst spill in America 's history , easily surpassing the Exxon Valdez environmental disaster , according to new government figures .
As BP made tentative progress in plugging the leak through a high - stakes ` ` top kill '' operation a mile under the surface of the ocean , the US president , Barack Obama , pledged to hold the British company responsible for the ` ` horrific damage '' caused by the accident .
` ` We will demand they pay every dime they owe for the damage and painful losses they ' ve caused , '' said the president , who will travel to the area <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-05-28">tomorrow</TIMEX3> .
He insisted he was personally overseeing the response to the disaster , brushing aside criticism of his government 's actions .
It became clear <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-05-27">today</TIMEX3> that the disaster is several times worse than BP and the government had previously estimated .
Experts revealed that between 12,000 and 19,000 barrels of oil had been gushing from the Macondo well daily since the spill began on <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">20 April</TIMEX3> , eclipsing an earlier figure of 5,000 barrels daily .
One measurement put the spill at up to 25,000 barrels <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EACH">each day</TIMEX3> .
That would mean that nearly 39 m gallons -LRB- 148 m litres -RRB- may have spilled .
` ` This is a very significant disaster , '' said Marcia McNutt , director of the US Geological Survey .
Even the conservative end of the figures put the spill at nearly 19 m gallons well in excess of the 11 m gallons lost when the Exxon Valdez oil tanker hit a reef off Alaska <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="1989">21 years ago</TIMEX3> , wreaking havoc along a wilderness coastline .
The White House blocked permits for new undersea drilling for <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="P6M">six months</TIMEX3> and suspended planned mining exploration at two sites in Alaska .
The top US regulator in charge of overseeing oil exploration , Elizabeth Birnbaum , resigned as Obama criticised her Minerals Management Service for having a ` ` sometimes corrupt '' relationship with the oil industry .
At a White House press conference Obama deflected comparison of his administration 's handling of the spill crisis with that of George Bush 's notoriously lacklustre response to Hurricane Katrina .
` ` I 'll leave it to you guys to make those comparisons , '' he told reporters .
But he admitted his administration had been too slow to produce its own estimate of the size of the spill , and that it should have pushed BP harder to share data from equipment on the ocean floor .
` ` This is an area where I do think our efforts fell short , '' he said .
` ` There was a lag of <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="PXW">several weeks</TIMEX3> that I think should not have happened . ''
BP succeeded in stemming the flow of the leak by pumping thick drilling mud into the ruptured ocean floor at high pressure .

But <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DURATION" value="P1D">24 hours</TIMEX3> into the ` ` top kill '' effort , its engineers were still trying to stabilise the well sufficiently to plug it with a concrete cap .
