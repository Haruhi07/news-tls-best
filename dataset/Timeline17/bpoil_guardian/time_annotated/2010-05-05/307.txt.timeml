-RRB- Chemicals used to break up the Deepwater Horizon oil spill before it reaches shore could do lasting damage to the waters of the Gulf of Mexico , environmental scientists say .
By BP 's own account , it has mobilised a third of the world 's supply of dispersant , so far pouring about 140,000 gallons -LRB- 637,000 litres -RRB- of the cocktail into the Gulf as of <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2010-05-05">today</TIMEX3> .
Some of the dispersant has been injected directly into the source of the spill on the ocean floor , a technique never deployed before , deepening concerns about further damage to the environment .
The dispersants are designed to break down crude into tiny drops , which can be eaten up by naturally occurring bacteria , to lessen the impact of a giant sea of crude washing on to oyster beds and birds ' nests on shore .

But environmental scientists say the dispersants , which can cause genetic mutations and cancer , add to the toxicity of the spill .
That exposes sea turtles and bluefin tuna to an even greater risk than crude alone .
Dolphins and whales have already been spotted in the spill .
The dangers are even greater for dispersants poured into the source of the spill , where they are picked up by the <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> and wash through the Gulf .
The high demand for dispersant carries an additional risk .
As BP runs through stocks of the chemical , called Corexit , scientists fear it will fall back on older stockpiles in the developing world that are more toxic than those approved for use in the US .
` ` You are trying to mitigate the volume of the spill with dispersant , but the price you pay is increased toxicity , '' said Richard Charter , a scientific adviser to Defenders of Wildlife .
` ` There are no good answers in a mess of this size . ''
