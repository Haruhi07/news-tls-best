Dave Martin\/AP The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> cost BP $ 1.25 bn -LRB- # 870 m -RRB- , as its much - criticised chief executive vows to spend ` ` what it takes '' to fix the Deepwater Horizon disaster that has caused growing anger across America .
The energy company continues to spend tens of millions of dollars <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> trying to stop the leak , mopping up oil on the surface , and compensating some of the people affected by the spill .
It has also been instructed by the US coastguard to pay the $ 360 m cost of building six sand booms off Louisiana to divert oil from the coastline , taking its committed spending over the $ 1.6 bn mark .
BP continues to insist that it can fix America 's worst ever environmental disaster .
Tony Hayward , BP 's embattled chief executive , tweeted on Twitter <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="TIME" value="2010-06-07TMO">this morning</TIMEX3> that ` ` Our top priority is the Gulf .
I will not be diverted away from that .
We will spend what it takes to make it right . ''
Hayward , who was dubbed ` ` the most hated and most clueless man in America '' <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2010-W22">last week</TIMEX3> , is handing responsibility for running the clean - up operation to its American director , Bob Dudley .
<TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2010-05">This may</TIMEX3> assuage some of the fury vented at the British company , which faces calls for its US assets to be seized .
Official estimates put the leak anywhere between 12,000 and 25,000 barrels of oil <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> , and it is not clear how successful the containment cap will be .
BP has said it collected around 10,000 barrels on <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2010-06-06">Sunday</TIMEX3> and hopes to eventually capture most of the leak , but the US coastguard is being much more cautious .
` ` I ' m hoping we catch as much oil as we can , but I ' m withholding any comment until production is at a full rate , '' said Thad Allen , the US coastguard admiral .
Oil from the stricken wellhead has <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> reached the beaches of Alabama and Florida , widening the environmental damage caused by the spill , despite 2.2 m ft -LRB- 6.7 km -RRB- of containment boom being deployed .
There are also 2,600 boats involved in the response effort .
BP said it has paid compensation totalling $ 48 m to 18,000 individuals out of a total of 37,000 compensation claims .
President Barack Obama , who has also been criticised for his approach to the catastrophe , said <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2010-06-06">yesterday</TIMEX3> it was ` ` brutally unfair '' that ordinary fishermen and shopkeepers were seeing their businesses damaged by the spill .
` ` If laws were broken , those responsible will be brought to justice , '' Obama said <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2010-06-06">yesterday</TIMEX3> .
` ` We will make sure they pay every single dime owed to the people along the Gulf coast . ''
The City continues to be reassured by BP 's efforts , and its refusal so far to cut its dividend .
The company 's shares were the biggest riser on the FTSE 100 <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="TIME" value="2010-06-07TMO">this morning</TIMEX3> , up as much as 11p or 2.7 % at 444p .
<TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="2010-06-07" mod="END">Later today</TIMEX3> a congressional committee will gather in Louisiana to hold a session into the local impact of the disaster .
The Committee on Energy and Commerce will hear from Natalie Roshto and Courtney Kemp , whose husbands were killed when the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">20 April</TIMEX3> , along with representatives from businesses and the Institute of Marine Mammal Services .
