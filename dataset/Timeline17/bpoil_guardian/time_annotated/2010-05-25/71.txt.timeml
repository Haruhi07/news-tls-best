The White House directed BP to cut its use of chemical dispersants to break up the Louisiana oil slick by as much as 50 % <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2010-05-24">yesterday</TIMEX3> , reflecting concerns that the clean - up of the spill could be worsening the economic disaster in the Gulf of Mexico .
Lisa Jackson , the head of the Environmental Protection Agency , said the Obama administration wanted the oil company to scale back its use of chemicals on the water surface .
The order came amid increasing tension between the administration and the oil company about how to manage the oil on the ocean floor , <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P1M" mod="MORE_THAN">more than a month</TIMEX3> after the sinking of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig .
` ` I am recommending as strongly as we can that we absolutely minimize the use of dispersants and that we monitor as rigorously as we can , '' she told a conference call with reporters touring Louisiana marshes contaminated by the oil .
She said she thought BP would be able to cut its use of chemicals to break up the spill by half or even 75 % by injecting smaller quantities underwater .
The directive is in line with a hardening of administration 's rhetoric against BP .
With thick brown sheets of crude oil <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> washing up on shore , the White House as well as the oil company is feeling the pressure of not stopping the leak .
Louisiana 's governor , Bobby Jindal , said he had warned the administration for days that the booms deployed by BP would not keep back the oil .
He has said some 65 miles of Louisiana 's coastline is affected , contaminating oyster beds and coating pelicans and sea turtles in oil .
Independent scientists and members of Congress have also been warning about BP 's heavy reliance on a dispersant called Corexit which is banned in the UK because it is harmful for marine life .
BP has poured more than 650,000 gallons of the chemical on to the spill .
Scientists told congressional hearings <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-W20">last week</TIMEX3> that Corexit was more toxic and less effective than other dispersants on the market .
Conservationists fear the chemical could further jeopardise already depleted stocks of fish such as Atlantic bluefin tuna or poison endangered species of turtle .
The Centre for Biological Diversity petitioned the Obama administration <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-05-24">yesterday</TIMEX3> to protect the bluefin tuna as an endangered species .
The move would compel the administration to consider the consequences of offshore drilling before sanctioning any more oil rigs .
Jackson directed the EPA <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010-W20">last week</TIMEX3> to seek out alternative chemicals within <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P1D">24 hours</TIMEX3> , but admitted <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-05-24">yesterday</TIMEX3> that BP had continued to use Corexit to break up the spill .
She and the coast guard commander , Mary Landry , defended the use of the chemical , arguing it had prevented a more devastating landfall of heavy crude .

But she admitted the longterm consequences of using enormous quantities of the chemical over such a long period of time were unresolved .
` ` It is clear to me that the science of dispersants has not in any way kept up with our ability to drill and use fossifl fuels and that is a huge disconnect , '' she said .
