Obama , about that BP oil spill just get the job done Outrage and punishment are good responses to the Gulf disaster .
But above all , the president needs to show competence Signs emerged <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-06-03">yesterday</TIMEX3> that maybe BP had finally done something right and begun to contain the devastating oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico , which is spewing at least 12,000 barrels of crude <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EVERY">every day</TIMEX3> since <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">20 April</TIMEX3> into a vital commercial fishing area and bird habitat , creating what we officially started calling in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-05" mod="END">late May</TIMEX3> the US 's worst - ever environmental disaster .
We 're told we 'll know more in ` ` some time '' , according to the commander of the federal response to the disaster .
By ` ` commander of the federal response to the disaster '' , I mean the coast guard admiral Thad Allen .
But his commander , of course , is Barack Obama .
And from his perspective , the underwater well is n't the only thing leaking .
His poll numbers are , daily .
The reason can be summed up in one word , a word that describes a quality we have n't seen nearly enough of in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> presidents , and a quality that more voters are starting to worry Obama lacks .
Back in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="1988">1988</TIMEX3> , the Democrat Michael Dukakis ran for president against George HW Bush by saying that the election was ` ` about competence , not ideology '' .
As campaign slogans go , it lacked a certain poetry , and besides , it did n't do him much good : a -RRB- the liberal base was put off because everyone knew that Dukakis was speaking in code and trying to tell average Americans that he was n't some acid - flinging leftie ; and b -RRB- he lost .
Competence as a theme went into storage .
We went through two presidencies , one more - or - less incompetent -LRB- Bush Sr 's -RRB- and one more - or - less competent -LRB-
Bill Clinton 's -RRB- .
Then came George W Bush , whose reverse - Midas touch made a mess of virtually everything , from Iraq to Katrina and culminated in the worst financial meltdown in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P8DE">eight decades</TIMEX3> .
<TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P20Y">Twenty years</TIMEX3> after Dukakis , competence was looking pretty desirable .
In those heady days of <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2008-11">November 2008</TIMEX3> , many US liberals convinced themselves Obama 's election meant average Americans were ready for a turn to the left .
As I suspected then , and as time has confirmed , this was n't so .
The independent , middle - of - the - road voters who chose Obama over John McCain were n't crying : ` ` Give us liberalism . ''
They were pleading : ` ` Give us competence . ''
The verdict so far ?
As Obama 's poll numbers suggest , not terrible , but not so hot .

The administration 's biggest accomplishment , the passage of the health bill , was seen by all but liberals as the Democrats choosing ideology over competence , and thus was n't and is n't very popular .
On the plus side , the economy is picking up , the employment figures are improving , and there are signs that consumers are aware .
There has been progress , however unspectacular , in Afghanistan and Iraq .
And while the administration has not yet produced any diplomatic breakthroughs of note , neither has it precipitated any major crisis .
The record has been good enough barely so that continued economic improvement and a diplomatic accomplishment or two will show voters that the guy is doing what they elected him to do .

But this oil spill , especially if it lingers until <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2010-08">August</TIMEX3> , could change everything .
This is not the moral equivalent of the Katrina catastrophe in which , let us recall , some 1,500 Americans died .
Most Americans seem to grasp this .
However , people are desperate for action as more and more of the Gulf coastline comes under threat .
And since surely no more than 2 % of them even know who Tony Hayward BP 's chief executive is , they quite understandably turn to the guy they do know : the president .
Much discussed in <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent days</TIMEX3> here in Washington is Obama 's inability to ` ` connect '' with the frustrations and concerns of Joe Sixpack .
It 's a valid criticism .
Obama appears to see himself as a mediator and conciliator , who vacuums up all -LRB- non - crazy -RRB- viewpoints and tries to express a consensus .
This is a valuable skill , and at his best moments , he 's put it to use either publicly or behind the scenes to nudge public opinion or get legislation passed .
It 's a style of leadership that has its place .
The spill requires a different style of leadership .
It requires a leader who can give voice to what regular people are feeling in their bones .
Obama has little instinct for that .
` ` let 's keep our heads here '' .
There are times , though , when outrage is needed .
But even more than executive outrage , what we really need here is a solution of some kind .
If BP 's new attempt to cap the leak does n't work , and if oil starts washing up on beaches and properties in a dramatic way that is , if this disaster takes on a more urgent , more human dimension then it really could become Obama 's Katrina .
Especially , let 's face it , if the ooze and the calamity spread to the electorally pivotal state of Florida , which is just on the precipice of happening .
People are also looking for BP to be punished .
<TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2010-W22" mod="END">Late this week</TIMEX3> , demonstrations began emerging outside BP petrol station - convenience stores across the country .
But Washington has to do more .
Congress is considering a bill raising BP 's liability cap from the <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> $ 75 m -LRB- # 51 m -RRB- to $ 10bn , but it 's debating and dithering as usual .
<TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2010-W22" mod="START">Earlier this week</TIMEX3> the US attorney general , Eric Holder , surveyed the damage , met with state law - enforcement types in the region and launched a criminal investigation aimed at BP .
This marks a much tougher posture from the government , which , for public relations purposes , is much needed .
And yet , at the same time , the government still needs to work closely with BP on fixing the problem .
Ratcheting up the rhetoric and launching a federal investigation in that context are delicate matters , though not impossible ones .
Anyone who does n't hate him has to feel a little badly for Obama .
First , he got smacked with the financial crisis , leaving him to spend his first <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">two years</TIMEX3> in office -LRB- if not more -RRB- cleaning up somebody else 's mess .
Then this , a uniquely perverse situation so lacking in precedent that there does n't even exist a federal agency designed to deal with it .

But hey he ran for the job , and he asked for it .
He can still be the kind of transformative president he wants to be .
But first things first .
Gain voters ' trust .
There 's an old American saying in urban politics that there 's not a Democratic or Republican way to pick up the garbage .
Nor to clean up an oil spill .
Just get it done .
