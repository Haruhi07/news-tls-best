BP oil spill prompts Q3 results delay Gulf oil spill means BP is to delay publication of third - quarter results as company requires more time to prepare figures <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-09-10">Friday</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-09-10">10 September 2010</TIMEX3> 10.16 BST BP is to delay publication of its third - quarter results in the wake of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill .
Photograph : Luke Macgregor\/Reuters BP has delayed the publication of its third - quarter results by <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P1W">a week</TIMEX3> because of the complexity of counting the cost of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
The oil firm said <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2010-09-10">today</TIMEX3> that the results would be released on <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2010-09-07">Tuesday</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2009-11-02">2 November</TIMEX3> , <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2009-11-09">a week later</TIMEX3> than previously indicated .
A spokesman said the company wanted more time to prepare the figures , saying because of the ` ` complex accounting issues associated with the Gulf of Mexico spill it 's prudent to allow a bit more time '' .
He also noted that BP used to publish its third - quarter results in <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2010-11">November</TIMEX3> but had brought them forward in <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent years</TIMEX3> .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2011-06">June</TIMEX3> , chief executive Tony Hayward who has since resigned was forced by the White House to suspend dividend payments to shareholders for the rest of <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2010">this year</TIMEX3> and to set aside $ 20bn instead to pay compensation to those affected by the disaster .
BP admitted <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2010-W36">this week</TIMEX3> that its managers on the Deepwater Horizon missed key warning signs in the hours before <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">the 20 April</TIMEX3> explosion aboard the oil rig , but an internal investigation shifted much of the blame towards other companies involved in the well .
Analysts at Evolution Securities noted that the eight key events that led to the disaster are interwoven between BP , Halliburton and Transocean , according to BP , and appear not to single out any one company or action as solely responsible for the accident .
` ` We suspect this makes a gross negligence case more difficult to prove and so subsequent litigation claims against BP will take longer and ultimately be spread between BP , its licence partners , Transocean and Halliburton . ''
BP 's market value has plunged by $ 72bn since the accident to $ 120bn , while its rivals have only fallen an average of 9 % .
` ` It appears that BP 's shares are still assuming a cost for the accident of $ 55bn .
If we assume that BP 's ultimate liability is 50 % of the $ 55bn decline in the market value this would still imply a share price of 510p , '' the analysts said .
BP shares were down 2.85 p at 412.6 p <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="TIME" value="2010-09-10TMO">this morning</TIMEX3> .
