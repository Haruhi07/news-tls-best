Photograph : Tannen Maury\/EPA Engineers trying to contain the oil spill from the stricken BP Deepwater Horizon well in the Gulf of Mexico have expressed optimism over the ` ` containment cap '' placed over the broken well , although it remains uncertain just how effective the method will be in capturing all of the oil .
Latest estimates released <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-06-06">today</TIMEX3> suggest that about 10,000 barrels of oil <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> are being caught in the device that was placed over the leaking pipe using remotely operated equipment .
The oil is being collected in the funnel - like cap and then ushered up to the surface , where it is collected in a tanker called the Discoverer Enterprise sitting above the wellhead .
In a familiar pattern in the crisis , <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> in its 48th day , a notably more upbeat impression of the containment operation was given by BP than by the US government .
BP 's chief executive Tony Hayward told the BBC that , once the production flow was up to full speed , he would expect the proportion captured ` ` to be the majority , probably the vast majority of the oil '' .

But Thad Allen , the US coastguard admiral who is co - ordinating the response of government agencies in the Gulf , gave a much more cautious assessment .
He told Face the Nation on CBS : ` ` I ' m hoping we catch as much oil as we can , but I ' m withholding any comment until production is at a full rate . ''
Behind Allen 's caution lies fears that the procedure could come a cropper as it did when a containment cap was first attempted over the leaking well : this was the result of icy hydrates forming from the mixing of oil and water , a process that clogs up the cap .
To prevent that happening again , methanol is being pumped into the cap in an attempt to stop the formation of the slush , while the pressure of the oil is slowly being increased through the use of vents on the side of the cap .
The final success of the process will not be known until all the vents are closed .
The <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> rate of extraction of 10,000 barrels <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> compares with the US government 's worst - case scenario which estimates that up to 25,000 barrels <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> of oil could be spewing from the well .
Even if the cap proves to be largely successful in siphoning off the outpouring oil , Allen stressed that the damage of the oil that has already escaped would be long term .
He said the spill was not monolithic , but was in fact hundreds of thousands of smaller spills spreading across a 200 - mile radius .
` ` We are in the middle of a long - term campaign , '' he said .
` ` We are fighting on three fronts : the sub - sea , the surface area above the well where the oil is coming up , and when it gets to shore we are fighting the battle there . ''
Two relief wells are being drilled down into the well to ` ` bottom kill '' it that is , to intercept the oil beneath the ocean bed and stop it rising up by blocking it with heavy mud .
The first relief well has <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> reached 7,000 ft beneath the sea bed and the other 3,000 ft beneath it , but neither is expected to intercept the well board until <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2009-08">August</TIMEX3> at the earliest .
The multiple efforts under way to drill the relief wells , spread dispersants below and on the sea surface and operate the containment cap is reflected in a hive of activity around the Deepwater Horizon site .
According to Allen , up to 20 vessels are deployed at any one time in a one - mile radius of the wrecked well .
As oil continues to come ashore on beaches in Alabama and the Panhandle of Florida , clean - up operations are being stepped up .
More than 400 fishing vessels are laying container booms and skimming oil from the surface off Alabama .
Unemployed people are being used in Alabama , Mississippi and Florida in the clean - up operation in a new scheme launched on <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2010-06-05">Saturday</TIMEX3> .
Some 400 jobless individuals were put to work over <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2010-W21-WE">the weekend</TIMEX3> .
The aim is to train up to 4,500 workers across the three states .
In his BBC interview , Hayward admitted that safety standards in deep - sea drilling were not up to scratch .
The BP chief executive said : ` ` It 's clearly unacceptable that it 's occurred , so what has to happen on the part of the industry and certainly BP is to move safety standards to a completely different level . ''
