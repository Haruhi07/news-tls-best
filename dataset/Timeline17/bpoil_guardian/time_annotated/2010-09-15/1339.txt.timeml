BP Deepwater Horizon solution is imminent claims Obama administration but effects could be felt for years BP 's oil well spill in the Gulf of Mexico may soon have a permanent seal .
Photograph : Keystone\/Rex Features The final solution to BP 's oil well spill could be in place by <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-09-12">Sunday</TIMEX3> , <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P5M">five months</TIMEX3> after the deadly explosion spewed 5 m barrels of crude into the Gulf of Mexico , the Obama administration said <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-09-15">today</TIMEX3> .
But officials conceded the effects of the spill , which turned the Gulf of Mexico into an environmental and economic disaster zone and brought one of the world 's biggest oil companies to the brink of ruin , would be felt for months , if not years .
Barack Obama 's point man on the oil spill , coastguard commander Thad Allen , told reporters in a conference call <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-09-15">today</TIMEX3> that drill crews were hours away from intercepting the Macondo well and installing a permanent plug .
` ` We started <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="TIME" value="2010-09-15TMO">this morning</TIMEX3> the final drilling process to close in on the bottom of the Macondo well , '' he said .
` ` <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P4D">Four days</TIMEX3> from <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> it could all be done .
This is the window we are looking at <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3> . ''
Allen said the administration had already begun to move out equipment from the well site , in anticipation of the placement of a permanent mud and cement seal .
He said the central pipe of the well is already under a cement seal , after oil was injected into the top of the well in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2010-07">July</TIMEX3> .
But he said it is unclear whether oil is still flowing in the area between that pipe and the rock formation .
But even with the end only hours away , Jane Lubchenco , who heads the National Oceanic and Atmospheric -LRB-
NOAA -RRB- adminstration , said there was still significant oil in the Gulf , especially at depths .
The admission marks a reversal for the rosy assertions by the administration <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2010-08">last month</TIMEX3> that nearly 75 % of the oil had been broken down or cleaned up .
` ` There continues to be some oil in the subsurface especially in this layer between 3,000 to 4,300 ft , '' she said .
` ` There is oil being observed in the sediment on the sea floor surface . ''
Much of that oil is in tiny droplets the width of a human hair but Lubchenco said that did not diminish its potential impacts .
Scientists on a University of Georgia research voyage reported <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2010-W37">this week</TIMEX3> that they had found a two - inch - thick layer of oil on the ocean floor , challenging the NOAA 's earlier assertions that the oil was rapidly being broken down .
Lubchenco promised the administration would continue to track the oil over the long term to ensure the health of the marine environment and protect the seafood industry in the Gulf .
Parish officials in Louisiana have reported a number of fish kills in areas affected by the spill and Plaquemines parish reported <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2010-W37">this week</TIMEX3> that large numbers of fish had died around Bayou Chaland on the west side of the Mississippi river .
The officials said it was unclear whether the fish were killed by contact with oil or because of a drop in oxygen levels caused by high activity among microbes eating up the oil .
