By <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="TIME" value="2010-04-20T10:00">10 am</TIMEX3> the shares had staged a partial recovery from early lows of 420p , after their biggest fall in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="P18Y">18 years</TIMEX3> , but were still trading 14 % lower , at 427p .
The company said a containment cap will be connected towards the end of the week , although the spill could worsen in the meantime .
BP has spent almost $ 1bn -LRB- # 700 m -RRB- so far attempting to plug the leak , but said it was ` ` too early '' to quantify other potential costs and liabilities associated with the incident .
The total bill could rise to as much as $ 12bn , according to UBS .

The company has received as many as 30,000 claims , mostly from businesses in the US states of Texas , Louisiana , Alabama and Florida , which involve loss of earnings or bereavement suffered by families of the 11 workers killed when the rig caught fire .
