Barack Obama finding out ` whose ass to kick ' over oil spill US president defends his handling of Gulf oil spill , telling NBC he would have already sacked BP chief Tony Hayward <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010-06-08">Tuesday</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-06-08">8 June 2010</TIMEX3> 13.19 BST
The chief executive of BP is already coping with the worst oil spill in US history and a clean - up operation approaching $ 1bn , but the worst may be yet to come : US president Barack Obama is on a factfinding mission in an attempt to discover ` ` whose ass to kick '' .
Interviewed on US television <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-06-07">yesterday</TIMEX3> , Obama also suggested that if Tony Hayward had been working for him , the BP figurehead would have been relieved of his duties by <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> .
The president was appearing on NBC 's <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2010-06-08">Today</TIMEX3> Show in an apparent attempt to show active engagement in dealing with the Gulf oil spill , while distancing the US government from responsibility for the leak .
Polls have shown mostAmericans believe Obama has handled the crisis poorly .
Hayward 's past comments include : '' I want my life back '' ; asserting that the Gulf was '' a very big ocean '' ; and that ` ` the environmental impact of this disaster is likely to be very , very modest '' , .
The president was unequivocal when asked about such comments by the show host , Matt Lauer , saying : ` ` He would n't be working for me after any of those statements . ''
The interview , snippets of which were released <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="TIME" value="2010-06-07TNI">last night</TIMEX3> by NBC , is due to air in the US <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2010-06-08" mod="END">later today</TIMEX3> .
The president defended his talks with Gulf fishermen and oil spill experts , saying their purpose was not academic rather , they were an exercise in asserting where the presidential boot should be administered , ` ` so I know whose ass to kick '' .
<TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2010-06-07">Yesterday</TIMEX3> , Obama met with Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen and the president 's cabinet for a briefing on the oil spill , which began with the Deepwater Horizon explosion that killed 11 workers .
After the meeting , Obama sought to reassure the nation that the Gulf coast would ` ` bounce back '' from the spill , but not without time , effort and reimbursement from BP .
In the NBC interview , Obama strongly defended his role in dealing with the crisis , including his three visits to the region since the spill began .
` ` I was down there <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2010-05">a month ago</TIMEX3> before most of these talking heads were even paying attention to the Gulf , '' Obama said , adding he has talked to a variety of ` ` experts '' on the oil spill , as well as the fishermen .
` ` I do n't sit around just talking to experts because this is a college seminar , we talk to these folks because they potentially have the best answers so I know whose ass to kick , '' the president said .
