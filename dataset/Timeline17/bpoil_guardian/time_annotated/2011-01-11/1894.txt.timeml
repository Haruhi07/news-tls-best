The White House commission investigating the BP disaster in the Gulf of Mexico began lobbying Congress <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-01-11">today</TIMEX3> to set aside anti - government sentiment and commit more funds to overseeing the offshore oil industry .
In presenting the commission 's final report on the BP disaster , commission co - chair William Reilly said he was launching an all - out campaign to get Congress , the Obama administration and the oil industry to impose tougher safety and environmental regulations .
` ` We are going to make a lot of noise , '' he said .
The commission , issuing 15 main recommendations , wants Congress to approve funds to create a separate safety agency for the offshore oil industry , whose chief would be shielded from political interference by being appointed for a fixed term .
The commission 's co - chair acknowledged turning the recommendations into reality would be a challenge given the prevailing mood in Washington .
Republicans took over the house of representatives <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2011-W01">last week</TIMEX3> vowing to roll back government regulations and environmental safeguards .
Meanwhile , the powerful Chamber of Commerce business lobby <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2011-01-11">today</TIMEX3> said overturning the Obama administration 's ` ` tsunami '' of environmental regulations would be a top priority for <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3> .
However , Bob Graham , the commission 's other co - chair , argued that even conservative Republicans would make an exception because of the economic and environmental consequences of the BP blow - out .
` ` It will override an ideological preference for less government intrusion , less government cost , '' Graham said .
` ` Members of Congress understand that this is not just a typical example of government regulating a private enterprise .
This is government regulating land that the people of the United States own , '' he added .
Reilly said the commission 's early conversations with oil executives about industry funding of a safety institute had been positive .
However , the American Petroleum Institute lobby group complained that companies had already made safety improvements since <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-04">last April</TIMEX3> 's blow - out .
` ` This does a great disservice to the thousands of men and women who work in the industry and have the highest personal and professional commitment to safety , '' Erik Milito of API said in a statement .
Among other top recommendations , the commission said it wants : cents Congress to raise the liability cap on offshore oil spills , <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> set at $ 75 m -LRB- # 48 m -RRB- , and to allocate 80 % of the funds from BP fines under the Clean Water act to Gulf restoration .
cents America to bring its safety regulations for deepwater drilling in line with tougher standards in Norway and Britain , which require companies to demonstrate they can deal with especially risky wells .
cents Oil companies to pay for an industry - wide safety institute , as part of their fees for drilling licences .
cents Congress to give more time , <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P60D" mod="EQUAL_OR_LESS">up to 60 days</TIMEX3> , to government regulators to approve oil drilling licences an idea resisted by senators from oil states such as Louisiana and Alaska .
Commission members were due to brief congressional staffers <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2011-01-11" mod="END">later today</TIMEX3> , and will testify before Congress <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2011-01">this month</TIMEX3> to press their case .
The 380 - page report on the causes of the disaster described a systematic breakdown of safety and environmental safeguards in offshore drilling , involving industry as well as government .
Democrats in Congress said the commission 's report showed the need to move ahead on legislation .
` ` Because systemic safety and oversight issues regarding the offshore oil industry persist , if we do not enact reforms there will likely be repeats of this disaster , '' said Ed Markey , who headed the house global warming committee <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> disbanded by the Republican majority .
In London , BP shares closed up 2.8 % .
Peter Hitchens , from stockbroker Panmure Gordon , said investors were reassured that the full report contained ` ` no more nasties '' after the release of part of the report <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2011-W01">last week</TIMEX3> .
It also followed a sell - off on <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2011-01-10">Monday</TIMEX3> after BP admitted it had to shut down 95 % of its Alaskan oil production because of a pipeline leak .
However , despite that sweeping indictment , the commission said the Obama administration had been ` ` excessive '' in ordering a six - month halt to offshore exploration .
The commission 's refusal to call for a halt to offshore drilling among its 15 main recommendations was criticised by environmental organizations <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2011-01-11">today</TIMEX3> .
` ` The commission 's full findings reveal that offshore drilling simply can not be done safely , '' the Oceana conservation organization .
` ` To suggest that the oil industry is ready to make the complete transformation called for in this report is not credible . ''
Greenpeace , in its response , said the commission was misguided to put its faith in a UK - style regulatory system .
` ` Only <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2011-W01">last week</TIMEX3> a committee of MPs raised the alarm over oil companies ' preparedness to deal with a major spill , '' the organization said .
