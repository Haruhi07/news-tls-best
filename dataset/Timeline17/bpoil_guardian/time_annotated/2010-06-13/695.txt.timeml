BP oil spill may not be capped until <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2009-12-25">Christmas</TIMEX3> , expert warns ` Everyone should be prepared for worst - case scenario ' , says the head of oil consultancy group <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-06-13">Sunday</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-06-13">13 June 2010</TIMEX3> 22.11 BST Workers clean up the oil washed ashore in Alabama from the BP Deepwater Horizon spill .
Nansen Saleri , a Gulf drilling expert , said he hoped BP would meet its <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2010-08">August</TIMEX3> timetable for capping the blown - out well , but made it clear success was not certain .
` ` I know it is a frightening assessment but everyone should be prepared for a worst - case scenario , and that could mean a <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2009-12-25">Christmas</TIMEX3> timeframe , '' said Saleri , chief executive of the consultancy group Quantum Reservoir Impact .
` ` The probable outcome is much better but the technological challenges are enormous . ''
The futures of BP and of wildlife around the Gulf of Mexico are largely dependent on the rapid success of two ` ` relief '' wells that are being drilled in an attempt to halt anywhere between 20,000 and 40,000 barrels of oil <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> that is flowing out of the stricken Macondo subsea hole .
Saleri , who dealt personally with four blowouts during a career with Saudi Aramco and Chevron , said the BP fire and spill was the worst he had seen .
He believes it may cause more damage than the Ixtoc I blowout <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="1980">30 years ago</TIMEX3> , which is regarded as the most damaging of its kind .
BP faced renewed pressure to do more to contain the Gulf of Mexico spill as the US and Britain played down diplomatic tensions over the crisis .

The British foreign secretary , William Hague , said relations between the US and UK were ` ` outstanding at every level '' .
He said it was up to BP under pressure in the US to suspend its dividend to help pay for damage to decide on its payout to shareholders .
David Cameron and Barack Obama talked at <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2010-W22-WE">the weekend</TIMEX3> , when Cameron expressed his sadness at the ` ` human and environmental catastrophe '' .
Tony Hayward , the BP chief executive , will be grilled about the disaster in the US on <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2010-06-17">Thursday</TIMEX3> when he appears before a special Senate hearing .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2010-06-16">Wednesday</TIMEX3> , Hayward and the BP chairman , Carl - Henric Svanberg , will meet the president at the White House to explain BP 's response .
According to reports , Obama will tell the pair he wants BP to establish a special account to meet damage claims by individuals and businesses hurt by the spill .
The prospect of a lengthy timescale to cap the well reinforces the views of Carlos Morales , the head of exploration at Petr leos Mexicanos -LRB- Pemex -RRB- .
The company was the operator of the Ixtoc I well in <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="1979">1979</TIMEX3> , when 3.3 m gallons of oil spilled into the Gulf .
It took <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DURATION" value="P10M" mod="LESS_THAN">nearly 10 months</TIMEX3> to bring the blowout under control .
Morales is <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> sharing technical information with BP in an attempt to help it block the Macondo leak .
He has warned it could take ` ` <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DURATION" value="P4M">four</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DURATION" value="P5M">five months</TIMEX3> '' for a relief well to cap the spill .
Hurricanes also pose a problem .
The hurricane season in the Gulf began <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="2010-06">this month</TIMEX3> , and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has predicted it will be ` ` active to very active '' , with up to 23 named storms and up to 14 hurricanes on the way .
Saleri said a bad storm could ` ` really complicate '' the environmental impact of spilled oil and delay relief drilling by <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DURATION" value="P2W">two weeks</TIMEX3> every time a hurricane strikes .
BP is also aware that the relief wells could be as unstable as the original one .
Experts admit no one can rule out another blowout such as the one that sent the original rig , Horizon Explorer , to the bottom of the ocean .
The British company has warned in a regulatory filing that a blowout on one of the relief wells could release a further 240,000 barrels of oil <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> , although Hayward has since discounted the chances of this .
` ` The relief wells ultimately will be successful , '' he said .
