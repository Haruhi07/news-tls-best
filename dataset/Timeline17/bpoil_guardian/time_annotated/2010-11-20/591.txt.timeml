BP faces new fines over second Alaska spill Oil giant BP ` failed to respond to alarms ' and had suffered burst pipelines since <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2001">2001</TIMEX3> , Anchorage court told Caribou near a BP oil pipeline in Alaska .
The oil giant was fined and put on probation over a spill from corroded pipes in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2006">2006</TIMEX3> .
Photograph : Al Grillo\/AP BP is facing new fines in connection with its criminal conviction for a huge oil spill on Alaska 's North Slope in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2006">2006</TIMEX3> .
Federal probation officer Mary Frances Barnes argued in an Anchorage federal court <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010-11-19">yesterday</TIMEX3> that a second spill in Alaska in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2009-11">November last year</TIMEX3> constituted a violation of its probation .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2006">2006</TIMEX3> , a corroded pipeline leaked 200,000 gallons of oil on to the tundra in the worst leak in the history of the North Slope .
The company was sentenced to <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P3Y">three years</TIMEX3> ' probation and ordered to pay $ 20 m -LRB- # 12.5 m -RRB- in criminal penalties and restitution .
The leak in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3> occurred when a pipeline at the BP - operated Lisburne oil field burst , leaking nearly 46,000 gallons of crude and oily water near Prudhoe Bay , Alaska .
After roughly <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="P165D">165 days</TIMEX3> of low - temperature warnings , BP found ice in the pipe .
<TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2010-12-04">Fifteen days later</TIMEX3> , operators discovered the rupture .
Investigators said BP operators had ` ` failed to respond to the alarms and failed to investigate or troubleshoot the cause of the alarms '' and argued that BP should have known better , as it had suffered a similar ruptures in other frozen pipelines as far back as <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2001">2001</TIMEX3> .
The troubled oil giant disputes the characterisation of its operations .
` ` We ' ve made measurable improvements in safety and reliability , '' BP spokesman Steve Rinehart told the Anchorage Daily News .
Among other things , the company argued , it had replaced corroded transit pipelines with new lines at a cost of $ 500 m .
Still , the ruling will only increase scrutiny of the British firm , which <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> estimated that the more <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2010-SU">this summer</TIMEX3> would end up costing it $ 40bn .
<TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2010-11" mod="START">Earlier this month</TIMEX3> , the investigative journal ProPublica revealed that BP 's own internal maintenance reports had documented that at least 148 its pipelines on the North Slope received an ` ` F - rank '' because of corrosion .
According to one welder , some of BP 's pipes ` ` have hundreds of patches on them . ''
After that report was published , a BP spokesman explained that an ` ` F '' ranking does not imply that an accident is imminent .
` ` It does prompt a higher priority repair plan depending on technical details and engineering review , '' Rinehart said .
The latest report will add to pressure on the company : in addition to costs relating the Gulf of Mexico spill , it was fined $ 50 m in <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2010-08">August</TIMEX3> over a <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2005">2005</TIMEX3> refinery explosion in Texas City that killed 15 people and injured 170 .

But the latest ruling is unlikely to affect the firm 's Alaskan operations , which the company plans to sell as part of a $ 30bn program to raise money to meet costs relating to Deepwater Horizon spill .
BP said it will respond to the government 's legal filings at a hearing on <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2010-12-20">December 20</TIMEX3> .
