The government moved to quell suggestions of indifference to the BP oil disaster <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-06-11">today</TIMEX3> when both David Cameron and the chancellor , George Osborne , spoke to BP 's chairman , Carl - Henric Svanberg , urging all sides to find a constructive solution to the environmental crisis .
Cameron and Osborne are involved in a delicate balancing act , facing calls to stand up to Barack Obama 's criticisms of BP and the anti - British sentiment on which the US president seems to be trading .
At the same time , Cameron can not afford to wreck the so - called special relationship by being seen to attack Obama on an issue that is causing the president political trouble .
After meeting the BP chairman in Downing Street , Osborne said : ` ` We are all concerned about the human and environmental impact and as the prime minister has said , we understand the concerns of the US administration .
` ` The prime minister is also clear that we need constructive solutions and that we remember the economic value BP brings to people in Britain and America . ''
Cameron will speak to Obama <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-06-12">tomorrow</TIMEX3> in a long arranged conversation , but there has been alarm in Tory circles after it emerged that only the climate change secretary , Chris Huhne , had been in touch with the US administration to discuss the crisis .
Cameron told Svanberg it was in everyone 's interest for the company to remain financially strong and stable .
BP has assured the government it is planning to suspend the planned # 10bn dividend <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010-W24">next week</TIMEX3> , and start the next phase of its clean - up campaign <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-W24">next week</TIMEX3> .
The conversation with the BP chairman took place after Cameron returned from Afghanistan .
Number 10 said in a statement : ` ` The prime minister explained that he was frustrated and concerned about the environmental damage caused by the leak , but made clear his view that BP is an economically important company in the UK , US and other countries .
He said it is in everyone 's interests that BP continues to be a financially strong and stable company .
Mr Svanberg made clear that BP will continue to do all that it can to stop the oil spill , clean up the damage and meet all legitimate claims for compensation . ''
Outside Number 10 , Svanberg said : ` ` I think we have done everything we can to try to fill the well
and we have said we would do everything expected from us in cleaning up the beach , taking care of all the claims and learn from this and make deep - sea drilling an even safer place . ''
BP directors will hold a special board meeting on <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2010-06-14">Monday</TIMEX3> to decide whether to cut the dividend or take some other kind of initiative as a ` ` peace offering '' to Barack Obama before a meeting at the White House on <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2010-06-16">Wednesday</TIMEX3> .
The public position of the oil group remains that no decision is likely on payouts to shareholders until much nearer <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2010-07-27">July 27</TIMEX3> , when the half - yearly financial figures and the forthcoming dividend policy must be given .
But privately there is increasing acceptance that the political heat is so intense that BP could need to make some kind of gesture , and earlier rather than later .
Options being considered include putting the dividend into an escrow or trust fund until the full scale of the spill liabilities are known .
The BP board meeting will include the chief executive , Tony Hayward , in Houston and other members via teleconferencing from different parts of the world .
A common line will be hammered out which will serve as a strategy position that Svanberg and Hayward will be able to present to Obama in Washington <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="UNDEF-REF-hour-PLUS-48">48 hours later</TIMEX3> .
But sources said BP would be in ` ` listening mode '' when its executives meet Obama in what is expected to be a difficult encounter , given that the US president has made personal attacks on Hayward and the company which have unnerved the financial markets and sent the BP share price spiralling downwards .
Earlier , the deputy prime minister , Nick Clegg , warned that a row between Britain and the United States over the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico risked turning into a futile and destructive bout of ` ` megaphone diplomacy '' .
Clegg told an audience in Madrid : ` ` I do n't frankly think we are going to reach a solution to stop the release of oil into the ocean any quicker by allowing this to spiral into a tit - for - tat political and diplomatic spat . ''
Anger is mounting in the City that Obama has singled out BP rather than US contractors such as Halliburton for criticism .
There is also concern that Cameron has not defended the British company more robustly .
The mayor of London , Boris Johnson , accused the Obama administration of indulging in ` ` anti - British rhetoric '' .
He told the BBC that huge numbers of British pensioners , whose retirement funds invest in BP , were losing money because of the continued attacks on the company .
New figures show that twice as much oil is spewing into the ocean than earlier estimates had suggested .
