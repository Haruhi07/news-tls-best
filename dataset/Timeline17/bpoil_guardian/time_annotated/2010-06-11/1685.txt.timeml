Nick Clegg <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-06-11">today</TIMEX3> warned that a row between Britain and the US over the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico was in danger of turning into a destructive bout of ` ` megaphone diplomacy '' .
` ` I do n't frankly think we are going to reach a solution to stop the release of oil into the ocean any quicker by allowing this to spiral into a tit - for - tat political and diplomatic spat , '' said Clegg , speaking in the Spanish capital , Madrid .
The deputy prime minister , responding to a question on Barack Obama 's increasingly strident criticism of the British oil company , added : ` ` I am not going to start intervening in a debate which clearly risks descending into megaphone diplomacy . ''
Anger at Obama singling out BP for criticism rather than US contractors such as Halliburton is mounting in the City .
There is also concern that the prime minister , David Cameron , has not defended the British firm more robustly .
Cameron is to discuss the oil spill in a telephone conversation with the US president <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-06-12">tomorrow</TIMEX3> .
London 's Conservative mayor , Boris Johnson , has accused the US of indulging in ` ` anti - British rhetoric '' and told the BBC that huge numbers of British pensioners , whose retirement funds are invested in BP , were losing money because of the continued attacks on the company .
Pressure on the embattled oil firm grew as estimates from US government scientists suggested that twice as much oil as thought was spewing from the broken vent , the third time the Obama administration has had to increase its estimate .
Clegg said Britain 's coalition government would avoid a spiralling war of words with Washington on the issue .
` ` I , and the whole of British government , want to only play ... as much as we can , a constructive role , which is to find a solution to what is a huge environmental disaster , '' he said .
` ` It is an ecological catastrophe .
It does need to be dealt with . ''
The row comes as BP said it may delay or reduce payouts to shareholders following pressure from Obama .
The company 's board of directors is considering deferring the payment or offering shareholders a portion of the dividend , which is due to be announced on <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2009-07-27">27 July</TIMEX3> .
` ` We are considering all options on the dividend , but no decision has been made , '' the BP boss , Tony Hayward , told the Wall Street Journal .
Previously , Hayward had said BP would continue to ` ` meet our obligations to our employees , and to our other stakeholders , including hundreds of thousands of shareholders , and millions more in mutual and pension funds , who rely on their investment in BP as part of their financial security and in many cases their retirement income '' .
Reports suggest BP will seek to establish an agreement with the White House that could see payouts held in ` ` escrow '' until the company 's liabilities for the clean - up are fully realized .
Other suggestions have included scrapping the dividend for one quarter or paying it in shares rather than cash , according to reports .
BP 's dividends are the biggest single contributor to FTSE shareholder income form , accounting for around # 1 of every # 7 handed to investors <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2009">last year</TIMEX3> .
The firm 's chairman , Carl - Henric Svanberg , told investors a decision on the dividend would be made <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2010-07">next month</TIMEX3> , while reassuring analysts that the company 's cash deposits were substantially large enough to afford the payment .
Obama and senior US politicians have been vocal in their anger at any potential dividend payment before the total cost of the disaster is known .
<TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2010-W23" mod="START">Earlier this week</TIMEX3> , the president said Hayward ` ` would n't be working for me '' after the BP chief 's remark that ` ` the environmental impact of this disaster is likely to be very , very modest '' .
Hayward has stressed that retaining investor confidence is important to ensure that BP remains financially strong enough to pay for a clean - up operation that some have predicted will last for years .
The chief executive of Britain 's National Association of Pension Funds said investors might be receptive to a suspension of dividends to protect the BP 's long - term future .
` ` BP 's <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> difficulties should n't have an immediate or serious impact on those saving into a pension scheme or on those who have retired , '' Joanne Segars said .
