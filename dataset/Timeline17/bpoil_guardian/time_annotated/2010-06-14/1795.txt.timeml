Barack Obama is due to meet Tony Hayward , chief executive of BP , and other directors of the company at the White House .
Photograph : Mandel Ngan\/AFP\/Getty Images BP is facing a bill of up to $ 34bn from the Gulf of Mexico disaster after US senators demanded the oil company deposited $ 20bn into a ring - fenced account to meet escalating compensation costs .
The sum dwarfs many analysts ' previous estimates , shared by BP , that put the cost of the clean - up effort and payment of damages to affected communities , such as fishermen , closer to a total of $ 5bn .
Shares in BP nose - dived by more than 9 % <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2010-06-14">today</TIMEX3> as investors took fright at the demand by the 54 Democratic senators , who represent a majority in the US upper house .
The company is <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> worth almost half what it was before the accident of just under <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-04">two months ago</TIMEX3> .
BP already faces up to $ 14bn in civil penalties , payable under US environmental law , assuming the leak is plugged in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2009-08">August</TIMEX3> .
These punitive damages are directly linked to the size of the spill already estimated at being up to eight times worse than the Exxon Valdez disaster in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="1989">1989</TIMEX3> with BP liable for up to $ 4,300 for each barrel - worth spilt .
Senate leaders insisted the $ 20bn ring - fenced account should be exclusively for ` ` payment of economic damages and clean - up costs '' and should not be seen as a cap on BP 's other legal liabilities .
With punitive damages pending too , the theoretical total of $ 34bn is equivalent to more than half the corporation tax paid by all British companies <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2009">last year</TIMEX3> .
Tony Hayward , chief executive of BP , and other directors of the company , will meet Barack Obama at the White House on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-06-16">Wednesday</TIMEX3> prepared to offer concessions in the hope of taking the sting out of mounting political attacks on the company .
BP will be in ` ` listening mode '' , willing to cut its next dividend , worth about $ 2.5 bn , possibly paying the cash into the clean - up fund .
It will also reiterate its commitment to paying all legitimate claims arising from the disaster .

But the company does not believe that the demand by the senators to stump up $ 20bn is justified .
Executives were also alarmed by the White House 's insistence <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010-W23">last week</TIMEX3> that BP must pay the wages of rig workers laid off by other firms because of the six - month moratorium on deepwater drilling in the gulf .
If pursued , the company fears it would be exposed to potentially limitless claims from anyone affected by the disaster , which would eventually bankrupt the company .
The company hopes that President Obama 's statement , following the meeting with BP , will draw back from the demand .
Hayward , who was in Houston <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-06-14">today</TIMEX3> overseeing the spill response , hosted a conference call with his board to discuss BP 's next move .
The company had indicated that it would wait as usual until close to its next results announcement , on <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2010-07-27">27 July</TIMEX3> , to decide whether or not to pay its next quarterly dividend .

But it is <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> set to announce its intentions sooner , perhaps as early as <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2010-06-10">Thursday</TIMEX3> .
It is understood BP could use the dividend as a bargaining chip in its talks with the White House .
Obama <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2010-06-14">today</TIMEX3> risked the wrath of families of 9\/11 victims by comparing the gulf spill to the 2001 terrorist attacks , as pressure intensified on the White House to show greater urgency over the crisis .
Ahead of a trip to Louisiana and a televised address to the nation <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2010-06-15">tomorrow</TIMEX3> , Obama said the spill , the worst environmental disaster in US history , would , like the <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2001">2001</TIMEX3> terror plots , continue to influence the country for decades to come .
Some people who lost relatives in the 9\/11 attacks rejected the comparison .
` ` I think he 's off - base , '' said Jim Riches , a former New York fire department deputy chief , whose son died at the World Trade Centre .
` ` These were 9\/11 murders not something caused by people trying to make money . ''
