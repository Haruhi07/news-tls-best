{"id": "254", "time": "2005-06-13", "text": "The -LRB- relatively -RRB- moderate conservative cleric Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , an ally of the unelected supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , is widely tipped to prevail in the election . \nBut Iranian bloggers are today writing that this may not be the certainty everyone had thought and that there is a late surge from the main reform candidate , former education minister Mostafa Moin , 54 . \nHossein Derakhshan , a Toronto-based Iranian who is visiting Tehran , writes on his Editor : Myself blog that he can not believe `` that mainstream media in Iran are ignoring all signs of a reformist candidate 's rise and still pushing for Rafsanjani as the savior '' . \nContinue reading ... What would Ho Chi Minh , that symbol of heroic resistance to the French and the US , make of it all ? \nKen Livingstone is 60 today . \nThe mayor has no official engagements today , but the London Assembly Lib Dems lost no time in wishing him a happy birthday . \n`` Mr Livingstone is now entitled to his Freedom Pass that will allow him to travel across the capital free of charge , '' a spokesman said today . \n`` The Liberal Democrats are hoping that with his new bus pass , the mayor will take the opportunity to visit many of the outer London areas that he has neglected over the last five years . '' \nActually , he wo n't be collecting the bus pass he 's entitled to - and anyway , a free travelcard is one of the perks of working at City Hall . \nThe mayor has enjoyed remarkable popularity ratings among Londoners since he was elected in 2000 , and few would bet against his running for a third term in 2008 . \nBut his detractors sense impending trouble . \nThey say Livingstone has neglected the binge drinking and traffic problems of suburban areas like Sutton and Croydon in favor of big inner city projects , and has failed to do enough to improve the Underground or combat congestion . \nNo doubt his critics will be out in force at the 2005 State of London debate next week . \nRegister now if you want to attend . \nDowning Street has announced the appointment of the 98th Archbishop of York , who will be John Sentamu , the first black man to hold the post in its 1,500 year history . \nIt will be the most senior appointment ever held by a member of an ethnic minority within the Church of England . \nSentamu , currently Bishop of Birmingham , immediately traveled to York today - taking the last second class place on a train full of York racegoers - to pray before the high altar of the great medieval cathedral , perhaps conscious that his journey has been rather longer and more extraordinary , probably , than that of any of his predecessors since the appointment of the city 's first archbishop , Paulinus , in 625 AD . \nContinue reading ... Andy Kershaw , the Radio 3 presenter and world music enthusiast , began the backlash against the largely white Live 8 line-ups when he said it would do nothing for `` Africa 's self-esteem '' . \nHe returns to the topic in the Independent , accusing Bob Geldof of `` breathtaking arrogance '' for inviting African artists to play at an `` Africa Calling '' concert at the Eden Project in Cornwall . \nFirst , he dismisses the idea of having Africans on his bill since , supposedly , they are not big enough draws . \nNow , outrageously , he is planning to corral the Africans into Cornwall rather than allow them to appear on the same stage , on equal terms , with their European and American counterparts . \nAnd I thought apartheid was dead ... Kershaw 's language is strong and , as this blog has argued before , the extension others have made of his argument - that Live 8 is somehow a conspiracy to keep Africans down - is missing the point . \nThe idea is to create a populist upsurge to pressure the G8 leaders , not to change the public 's attitude to Africa . \nThat would be a happy consequence , however , and if - as Kershaw puts it - a `` few African bands -LRB- may even be -RRB- refreshing after watching hours of clapped-out , over-familiar rock stars '' , that is no bad thing either . \nI 've just spoken to religious affairs correspondent Stephen Bates , who 's on a train with the Church of England 's first black Archbishop . \nStephen will be posting to the Newsblog today . \nEuropean leaders are meeting today in Brussels to discuss the thorny question of budget reforms . \nOn our business site , Victor Keegan argues for a sharp cut in eurozone interest rates in order to revive Europe 's flagging economies . \nAnd as the summer 's other major summit approaches , at a school in Fife this morning Gordon Brown kept the focus on Africa , telling his audience of the human suffering he had encountered on visits to Africa . \nHere on the Newsblog we report on the latest attack on Bob Geldof 's Live 8 line-up . \nIranians are voting in their election today ; we 'll have an audio report from Robert Tait in Tehran and a round-up of the best pictures . \nAnd Jane Perrone blogs here about the great asparagus shortage of 2005 . \nWhere 's the best place to hit capitalism where it hurts ? \nOn the course , of course . \nThe links between golf and filthy lucre have always looked pretty strong , as this report in Capitalism magazine perfectly illustrates , hailing the climax of the 2003 US Masters as `` a good day for golf , capitalism , and , of course , Mike Weir '' . \nAfter all , what other sport attaches such importance -LRB- in public , at any rate -RRB- to its ` money list ' ? \nIndeed , one of the moments of maximum emotional impact in Michael Moore 's Fahrenheit 9\\/11 , the evidence that appeared to clinch the case for George Bush 's status as corporate ratbag no 1 , came when the president turned to the cameras after outlining his stance on global terrorism and urged : `` Now watch this drive . '' \nSo it seemed appropriate when this year 's summit of the G8 group of the world 's wealthiest nations was sited in Gleneagles , one of the world 's most famous golfing spots . \nBut , those less favourably disposed to the idea of global capitalist hegemony have also dabbled in the sport , and Gleneagles 2005 provided a perfect opportunity for anti-capitalism protesters to make their point . \nAn anarchist organization calling itself the People 's Golfing Association looks able to achieve this aim with some lan , even if their style is slightly more SAS commando than Payne Stewart . \nTheresa May wants more women . \nSpecifically , she wants 50 of them to fight the Tories ' most winnable seats at the next election . \nThis may not sound particularly radical - and by the standards of the Labor party , which has already embraced all-female shortlists and the Emily 's List initiative , it is n't . \nNone the less , the shadow secretary 's call for half of the Tories ' top targets to be contested by women will dismay many in the party - and not just male would-be candidates , but also those who oppose positive action on principle . \nAs many of them admitted at a Fawcett Society fringe event last year , Tory ladies of a certain age tend to pick men to represent them in the Commons . \nOften this is because they fear women with families will not be able to devote all their resources to winning the seat . \nSometimes female candidates lack the time for the schmoozing that wins over local party members . \nAnd there is strong grassroots resistance to all-female shortlists - not just because members feel Conservative Central Office is telling them what to do , but because Tories tend to believe that the talented should be able to rise to the top without special favors . \nContinue reading ...

Morning all . \nI 've just been listening to Bono impersonate Warren Buffett . \nThe rock star has spent a day talking to the Guardian 's Madeleine Bunting about how he 's trying to win over American hearts to his Africa crusade : you can hear an audio clip of him talking about how the legendary stock market investor told him : `` Do n't appeal to the conscience of America , appeal to its greatness , and I think you 'll get the job done . '' \nNews has been trickling out this morning about a hostage drama at an international school in Cambodia : the latest is that a girl has been killed as police freed the hostages . \nWe 'll be keeping an eye on Tony Blair as he tries to save Britain 's EU rebate at the European summit in Brussels ; we 've also followed up the latest royal security breach involving a fake bomb and a tabloid reporter , this time targeting Prince Harry at Sandhurst , and we 'll be reporting on a video smuggled out of China showing violence over land rights that left six people dead . \nThe proposed Bridge of Reeds , intended to be built near Cambridge This is the Bridge of Reeds - and it 's rather more exciting than the average footbridge . \nThe design for the 175ft high bridge was today officially announced as the winner of a competition to find a new landmark for the east of England , beating more than 230 other entries by architects from around the world . \nContinue reading ...

Michael Jackson 's rehabilitation might be sooner than anyone could have predicted . \nSunday 's papers reported that Jackson is ` frantic ' to appear at the Philadelphia concert . \nInterviewed today on London 's radio station Capital FM , promoter Harvey Goldsmith confirmed that they would certainly ` consider ' adding Jackson to the bill , if approached by the singer . \nGoldsmith added : `` Whether it 's appropriate or not is another issue , whether he 's in a fit state to work is another issue , whether he can work is another issue and whether he can work live is another issue . '' \nSean Penn visits Tehran 's cinema museum . \nPhotograph : Hasan Sarbakhshian\\/AP Actor\\/activist Sean Penn is in Tehran to report on the Iranian election campaign for the San Francisco Chronicle , the blog Iran Scan reports . \nAccording to Reuters , Penn visited Friday prayers , scribbling away in his notebook . \nIran Scan 's Afshin Molavi writes : I wonder how Sean Penn will see things . \nWill he honestly portray what he sees ? \nOr will he be blinded by his hatred of President George W Bush to fall into the trap many a good leftist falls into : defending the Islamic Republic to take a jab at Bush . \nProgressives in America consistently fail to side with the forces for democracy in Iran because it might just seem too , well , Wolfowitzian or , worse , Rumsfeldian . \nThe Chronicle has yet to publish any of Penn 's reports , as far as I can see . \nBut as Molavi points out , on the one hand , Penn 's presence ensures that more Americans will learn about Iran : on the other , it 's worth recalling the last Middle East country he visited was Iraq in December 2002 . \nAnd we all know how that ended up . \nAlso in Tehran is Iranian blogfather Hossein Derakhshan , who is visiting his home country for the first time in several years . \nIt 's a brave act for a blogger who knows all too well the risks of speaking out . \nIt 's possible that Penn and Hoder , as Derakhshan is known , could meet via the networking powers of blogging powerhouse Joi Ito , if the comments on this post are anything to go by . \nMeanwhile events in Iran have taken a worrying turn . \nSunday 's bombings have hardly improved the mood of the campaign - now being described as the closest in the country 's history - as it enters its final stages ahead of Friday 's vote . \nBlogger Mr Behi says : `` Street bombing is rare here in Iran and I can not personally recall one in many years '' , while S'can - Iranic calls the attacks `` ominous '' . \nMichael Jackson is innocent . \nWe 've got audio from Dan Glaister , our reporter who covered the trial in Santa Maria , California ; we 'll be rounding up bloggers ' reactions , we 've a digest of what the UK 's papers say ; and we 're gathering photographs of fans celebrating outside the courthouse . \nAs I write , Tony Blair is speaking in Paris ahead of talks with Jacques Chirac . \nEarlier in Luxembourg he rejected a proposal by the EU presidency to freeze Britain 's contentious budget rebate - Matthew Tempest reports here . \nIn Iraq , there have been bombings in Kirkuk and Baghdad ; suspected Islamist terrorists have been arrested in Germany ; and there are warnings of a cholera outbreak in the Afghan capital , Kabul . \nDeclan Walsh 's friends in Pakistan often berate him for failing to find positive news stories to write about . \n`` The problem in Pakistan is that there is just so much bad news , '' he writes . \nFor example , in his world dispatch today he details the case of Mukhtaran Bibi , who became a national hero after confronting in court the gang that raped her but who has now been banned from leaving the country . \nWaiting for tonight 's Michael Jackson verdict gave us the chance to indulge in some serious TV news geekery . \nSo let 's get the obvious , cliched response out of the way . \nThis was the OJ chase all over again tonight , not quite 11 years since the last one , but looking much the same as before . \nAll the channels cut to helicopter footage of Jackson 's four vehicle SUV convoy slowly being waved out of his Neverland ranch by a long line of staff , and then watched as it made its way along the freeways to the courthouse in Santa Maria . \nAs those images filled our screens , each of the British news channels was living up to stereotypes in the background . \nSo ITV News Channel did something cheap-looking , with lots of people on the phone and - it seems - none of their own people actually in California , relying instead on the US MSNBC network . \nThe BBC managed to be rather more sober and , of course , big budget , with their correspondent going on matters like security and What Happens Next from Live Outside The Courthouse . \nContinue reading ...

{"id": "322", "time": "2005-01-04", "text": "The victims of the tsunami pay the price of war on Iraq US and British aid is dwarfed by the billions both spend on slaughter Tuesday 4 January 2005 08.43 GMT There has never been a moment like it on British television . \nThe Vicar of Dibley , one of our gentler sitcoms , was bouncing along with its usual bonhomie on New Year 's Day when it suddenly hit us with a scene from another world . \nTwo young African children were sobbing and trying to comfort each other after their mother had died of Aids . \nHow on earth , I wondered , would the show make us laugh after that ? \nIt made no attempt to do so . \nOne by one the characters , famous for their parochial boorishness , stood in front of the camera wearing the white armbands which signalled their support for the Make Poverty History campaign . \nYou would have to have been hewn from stone not to cry . \nThe timing was perfect . \nIn my local Oxfam shop last week , people were queueing to the door to pledge money for the tsunami fund . \nA pub on the other side of town raised # 1,000 on Saturday night . \nIn the pot on the counter of the local newsagent 's there must be nearly # 100 . \nThe woman who runs the bakery told me about the homeless man she had seen , who emptied his pockets in the bank , saying `` I just want to do my bit '' , while the whole queue tried not to cry . \nOver the past few months , reviewing the complete lack of public interest in what is happening in the Democratic Republic of Congo , and the failure , in the west , to mobilise effective protests against the continuing atrocities in Iraq , I had begun to wonder whether we had lost our ability to stand in other people 's shoes . \nI have now stopped wondering . \nThe response to the tsunami shows that , however we might seek to suppress it , we can not destroy our capacity for empathy . \nBut one obvious question recurs . \nWhy must the relief of suffering , in this unprecedentedly prosperous world , rely on the whims of citizens and the appeals of pop stars and comedians ? \nWhy , when extreme poverty could be made history with a minor redeployment of public finances , must the poor world still wait for homeless people in the rich world to empty their pockets ? \nThe obvious answer is that governments have other priorities . \nAnd the one that leaps to mind is war . \nIf the money they have promised to the victims of the tsunami still falls far short of the amounts required , it is partly because the contingency fund upon which they draw in times of crisis has been spent on blowing people to bits in Iraq . \nThe US government has so far pledged $ 350m to the victims of the tsunami , and the UK government # 50m -LRB- $ 96m -RRB- . \nThe US has spent $ 148 billion on the Iraq war and the UK # 6bn -LRB- $ 11.5 bn -RRB- . \nThe war has been running for 656 days . \nThis means that the money pledged for the tsunami disaster by the United States is the equivalent of one and a half day 's spending in Iraq . \nThe money the UK has given equates to five and a half days of our involvement in the war . \nIt looks still worse when you compare the cost of the war to the total foreign aid budget . \nThe UK has spent almost twice as much on creating suffering in Iraq as it spends annually on relieving it elsewhere . \nThe United States gives just over $ 16bn in foreign aid : less than one ninth of the money it has burnt so far in Iraq . \nThe figures for war and aid are worth comparing because , when all the other excuses for the invasion of Iraq were stripped away , both governments explained that it was being waged for the good of the Iraqis . \nLet us , for a moment , take this claim at face value . \nLet us suppose that the invasion and occupation of Iraq had nothing to do with power , domestic politics or oil , but were , in fact , components of a monumental aid program . \nAnd let us , with reckless generosity , assume that more people in Iraq have gained as a result of this aid program than lost . \nTo justify the war , even under these wildly unsafe assumptions , George Bush and Tony Blair would have to show that the money they spent was a cost-efficient means of relieving human suffering . \nAs it was sufficient to have made a measurable improvement in the lives of all the 2.8 billion people living in absolute poverty , and as there are only 25 million people in Iraq , this is simply not possible . \nEven if you ignore every other issue - such as the trifling matter of mass killing - the opportunity costs of the Iraq war categorise it as a humanitarian disaster . \nIndeed , such calculations suggest that , on cost grounds alone , a humanitarian war is a contradiction in terms . \nBut our leaders appear to have lost the ability to distinguish between helping people and killing them . \nThe tone of Blair 's New Year message was almost identical to that of his tear-jerking insistence that we understand the Iraqi people must be bombed for their own good . \nThe US marines who have now been dispatched to Sri Lanka to help the rescue operation were , just a few weeks ago , murdering the civilians -LRB- for this , remember , is an illegal war -RRB- , smashing the homes and evicting the entire population of the Iraqi city of Falluja . \nEven within the official aid budgets the two aims are confused : $ 8.9 bn of the aid money the US spends is used for military assistance , anti-drugs operations , counter-terrorism and the Iraq relief and reconstruction fund -LRB- otherwise known as the Halliburton benevolent trust -RRB- . \nFor Bush and Blair , the tsunami relief operation and the Iraq war are both episodes in the same narrative of salvation . \nThe civilised world rides out to rescue foreigners from their darkness . \nWhile they spend the money we gave them to relieve suffering on slaughtering the poor , the world must rely for disaster relief on the homeless man emptying his pockets . \nIf our leaders were as generous in helping people as they are in killing them , no one would ever go hungry . \nYou can join the campaign against global poverty at : www.makepovertyhistory.org Letters for publication should be sent to : letters@guardian.co.uk If you need help using the site : userhelp@guardian.co.uk Call the main Guardian and Observer switchboard : George Monbiot : Tsunami victims pay price of war on Iraq This article was published on guardian . \n"}
{"id": "15", "time": "2005-02-23", "text": "Wednesday 23 February 2005 12.14 GMT A US tank moves into position near Iraq 's western border . \nPhotograph : Adam Butler\\/AP The attorney general , Lord Goldsmith , warned less than two weeks before the invasion of Iraq that military action could be ruled illegal . \nThe government was so concerned that it might be prosecuted it set up a team of lawyers to prepare for legal action in an international court . \nAnd a parliamentary answer issued days before the war in the name of Lord Goldsmith - but presented by ministers as his official opinion before the crucial Commons vote - was drawn up in Downing Street , not in the attorney general 's chambers . \nThe full picture of how the government manipulated the legal justification for war , and political pressure placed on its most senior law officer , is revealed in the Guardian today . \nIt appears that Lord Goldsmith never wrote an unequivocal formal legal opinion that the invasion was lawful , as demanded by Lord Boyce , chief of defense staff at the time . \nThe Guardian can also disclose that in her letter of resignation in protest against the war , Elizabeth Wilmshurst , deputy legal adviser at the Foreign Office , described the planned invasion of Iraq as a `` crime of aggression '' . \nShe said she could not agree to military action in circumstances she described as `` so detrimental to the international order and the rule of law '' . \nHer uncompromising comments , and disclosures about Lord Goldsmith 's relations with ministers in the run-up to war , appear in a book by Philippe Sands , a QC in Cherie Booth 's Matrix chambers and professor of international law at University College London . \nExclusive extracts of his book Lawless World are published in today 's Guardian . \nLord Goldsmith warned Tony Blair in a document on March 7 2003 that the use of force against Iraq could be illegal . \nIt would be safer to have a second UN resolution explicitly sanctioning military action . \n`` So concerned was the government about the possibility of such a case that it took steps to put together a legal team to prepare for possible international litigation , '' writes Mr Sands . \nThe government has refused to publish the March 7 document . \nIt was circulated to only a very few senior ministers . \nAll Lord Goldsmith gave the cab inet was a later oral presentation of a parliamentary answer issued under his name on March 17 . \nThis appears contrary to the official ministerial code , which states that the complete text of opinions by the government 's law officers should be seen by the full cabinet . \nOn March 13 2003 , Lord Goldsmith told Lord Falconer , then a Home Office minister , and Baroness Morgan , Mr Blair 's director of political and government relations , that he believed an invasion would , after all , be legal without a new UN security council resolution , according to Mr Sands . \nOn March 17 , in response to a question from Baroness Ramsay , a Labor peer , Lord Goldsmith stated that it was `` plain '' Iraq continued to be in material breach of UN resolution 1441 . \n`` Plain to whom ? ' \nIt is clear , he says , that Lord Goldsmith 's answer was `` neither a summary nor a precis of any of the earlier advices which the attorney general had provided '' . \nHe adds : `` The March 17 statement does not seem to have been accompanied by a formal and complete legal opinion or advice in the usual sense , whether written by the attorney general , or independently by a barrister retained by him '' . \nSeparately , the Guardian has learned that Lord Goldsmith told the inquiry into the use of intelligence in the run-up to war that his meeting with Lord Falconer and Baroness Morgan was an informal one . \nHe did not know whether it was officially minuted . \nLord Goldsmith also made clear he did not draw up the March 17 written parliamentary answer . \nThey `` set out my view '' , he told the Butler inquiry , referring to Lord Falconer and Baroness Morgan . \nYet the following day , March 18 , that answer was described in the Commons order paper as the attorney general 's `` opinion '' . \nDuring the debate , influential Labor backbenchers and the Conservative frontbench said it was an important factor behind their decision to vote for war . \nRobin Cook , the former foreign secretary and leader of the Commons , yesterday described the Guardian 's disclosure as alarming . \n`` It dramatically reveals the extent to which the legal opinion on the war was the product of a political process . '' \nThe case for seeing the attorney general 's original advice was now overwhelming , Mr Cook added . \n`` What was served up to parliament as the view of the attorney general turned out to be the view of two of the closest aides of the prime minister , '' he said . \nSir Menzies Campbell , the Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman , said the government 's position had been seriously undermined . \n`` The substance of the attorney general 's advice , and the process by which it was partially published , simply do not stand up to scrutiny , '' he said . \nSir Menzies added : `` The issue is all the more serious since the government motion passed by the House of Commons on March 18 2003 , endorsing military action against Iraq , was expressly based on that advice . '' \nHe continued : `` The public interest , which the government claims justifies non-publication of the whole of the advice , can only be served now by the fullest disclosure . '' \nLord Goldsmith twice changed his view in the weeks up to the invasion . \nHe wrote to Mr Blair on March 14 2003 , saying it was `` essential '' that `` strong evidence '' existed that Iraq was still producing weapons of mass destruction . \nThe next day , the prime minister replied , saying : `` This is to confirm it is indeed the prime minister 's unequivocal view that Iraq is in further material breach of its obligations . '' \nThe same day , Lord Boyce got the unequivocal advice he says he was after in a two-line note from the attorney gen eral 's office . \nThe extent of concern among military chiefs is reflected by Gen Sir Mike Jackson , head of the army , quoted by Peter Hennessy , professor of contemporary history at Queen Mary College , London . \n`` I spent a good deal of time recently in the Balkans making sure Milosevic was put behind bars , '' said Sir Mike . \n`` I have no intention of ending up in the next cell to him in the Hague . '' \nMr Sands records that Lord Goldsmith visited Washington in February 2003 when he met John Bellinger , legal adviser to the White House National Security Council . \nAn official later told Mr Sands : `` We had trouble with your attorney , we got him there eventually . '' \nA spokeswoman for Lord Goldsmith said yesterday : `` The attorney has said on many occasions he is not going to discuss process issues '' . \nThe March 17 parliamentary answer was the `` attorney 's own answer '' , she said adding that he would not discuss the processes of how the document was drawn up . \nThe Department for Constitutional Affairs said it could not say if Lord Falconer had a role in drawing up the answer . \n"}
{"id": "29", "time": "2005-06-25", "text": "Current US megalomania is rooted in the Puritan colonists ' certainties Saturday 25 June 2005 00.37 BST Three continuities link the global US of the cold war era with the attempt to assert world supremacy since 2001 . \nThe first is its position of international domination , outside the sphere of influence of communist regimes during the cold war , globally since the collapse of the USSR . \nThis hegemony no longer rests on the sheer size of the US economy . \nLarge though this is , it has declined since 1945 and its relative decline continues . \nIt is no longer the giant of global manufacturing . \nThe center of the industrialised world is rapidly shifting to the eastern half of Asia . \nUnlike older imperialist countries , and unlike most other developed industrial countries , the US has ceased to be a net exporter of capital , or indeed the largest player in the international game of buying up or establishing firms in other countries , and the financial strength of the state rests on the continued willingness of others , mostly Asians , to maintain an otherwise intolerable fiscal deficit . \nThe influence of the American economy today rests largely on the heritage of the cold war : the role of the US dollar as the world currency , the international linkages of US firms established during that era -LRB- notably in defence-related industries -RRB- , the restructuring of international economic transactions and business practices along American lines , often under the auspices of American firms . \nThese are powerful assets , likely to diminish only slowly . \nOn the other hand , as the Iraq war showed , the enormous political influence of the US abroad , based as it was on a genuine `` coalition of the willing '' against the USSR , has no similar foundation since the fall of the Berlin wall . \nOnly the enormous military-technological power of the US is well beyond challenge . \nIt makes the US today the only power capable of effective military intervention at short notice in any part on the world , and it has twice demonstrated its capacity to win small wars with great rapidity . \nAnd yet , as the Iraq war shows , even this unparalleled capacity to destroy is not enough to impose effective control on a resistant country , and even less on the globe . \nNevertheless , US dominance is real and the disintegration of the USSR has made it global . \nThe second element of continuity is the peculiar house-style of US empire , which has always preferred satellite states or protectorates to formal colonies . \nThe expansionism implicit in the name chosen for the 13 independent colonies on the east coast of the Atlantic -LRB- United States of America -RRB- was continental , not colonial . \nThe later expansionism of `` manifest destiny '' was both hemispheric and aimed towards East Asia , as well as modelled on the global trading and maritime supremacy of the British Empire . \nOne might even say that in its assertion of total US supremacy over the western hemisphere it was too ambitious to be confined to colonial administration over bits of it . \nThe American empire thus consisted of technically independent states doing Washington 's bidding , but , given their independence , this required continuous readiness to exert pressure on their governments , including pressure for `` regime change `` and , where feasible -LRB- as in the mini-republics of the Caribbean zone -RRB- , periodic US armed intervention . \nThe third thread of continuity links the neo-conservatives of George Bush with the Puritan colonists ' certainty of being God 's instrument on earth and with the American Revolution - which , like all major revolutions , developed world-missionary convictions , limited only by the wish to shield the the new society of potentially universal freedom from the corruptions of the unreconstructed old world . \nThe most effective way of finessing this conflict between isolationism and globalism was to be systematically exploited in the 20th century and still serves Washington well in the 21st . \nIt was to discover an alien enemy outside who posed an immediate , mortal threat to the American way of life and the lives of its citizens . \nThe end of the USSR removed the obvious candidate , but by the early 90s another had been detected in a `` clash '' between the west and other cultures reluctant to accept it , notably Islam . \nHence the enormous political potential of the al-Qaida outrages of September 11 was immediately recognized and exploited by the Washington world-dominators . \nThe first world war , which made the US into a global power , saw the first attempt to translate these world-converting visions into reality , but Woodrow Wilson 's failure was spectacular ; perhaps it should be a lesson to the current world-supremacist ideologists in Washington , who , rightly , recognize Wilson as a predecessor . \nUntil the end of the cold war the existence of another superpower imposed limits on them , but the fall of the USSR removed these . \nFrancis Fukuyama prematurely proclaimed `` the end of history '' - the universal and permanent triumph of the US version of capitalist society . \nAt the same time the military superiority of the US encouraged a disproportionate ambition in a state powerful enough to believe itself capable of world supremacy , as the British Empire in its time never did . \nAnd indeed , as the 21st century began , the US occupied a historically unique and unprecedented position of global power and influence . \nFor the time being it is , by the traditional criteria of international politics , the only great power ; and certainly the only one whose power and interests span the globe . \nIt towers over all others . \nAll the great powers and empires of history knew that they were not the only ones , and none was in a position to aim at genuinely global domination . \nNone believed themselves to be invulnerable . \nNevertheless , this does not quite explain the evident megalomania of US policy since a group of Washington insiders decided that September 11 gave them the ideal opportunity for declaring its single-handed domination of the world . \nFor one thing , it lacked the support of the traditional pillars of the post-1945 US empire , the state department , armed services and intelligence establishment , and of the statesmen and ideologists of cold war supremacy - men like Kissinger and Brzezinski . \nThese were people who were as ruthless as the Rumsfelds and Wolfowitzes . \n-LRB- It was in their time that a genocide of Mayas took place in Guatemala in the 1980s . -RRB- \nThey had devised and managed a policy of imperial hegemony over the greater part of the globe for two generations , and were perfectly ready to extend it to the entire globe . \nThey were and are critical of the Pentagon planners and neo-conservative world supremacists because these patently have had no concrete ideas at all , except imposing their supremacy single-handed by military force , incidentally jettisoning all the accumulated experience of US diplomacy and military planning . \nNo doubt the debacle of Iraq will confirm them in their scepticism . \nEven those who do not share the views of the old generals and proconsuls of the US world empire -LRB- which were those of Democratic as well as Republican administrations -RRB- will agree that there can be no rational justification of current Washington policy in terms of the interests of America 's imperial ambitions or , for that matter , the global interests of US capitalism . \nIt may be that it makes sense only in terms of the calculations , electoral or otherwise , of American domestic policy . \nIt may be a symptom of a more profound crisis within US society . \nIt may be that it represents the - one hopes short-lived - colonisation of Washington power by a group of quasi-revolutionary doctrinaires . \n-LRB- At least one passionate ex-Marxist supporter of Bush has told me , only half in jest : `` After all , this is the only chance of supporting world revolution that looks like coming my way . '' -RRB- \nSuch questions can not yet be answered . \nIt is reasonably certain that the project will fail . \nHowever , while it continues , it will go on making the world an intolerable place for those directly exposed to US armed occupation and an unsafer place for the rest of us . \nEric Hobsbawm is author of The Age of Extremes : The Short 20th Century 1914-1991 . \nThis is an edited extract from his preface to a new edition of VG Kiernan 's America : The New Imperialism Letters for publication should be sent to : letters@guardian.co.uk If you need help using the site : userhelp@guardian.co.uk Call the main Guardian and Observer switchboard : This article was published on guardian . \nLike a MacBook Pro '' says @Mister_Solomon : Westminster Dog Show - live ! \n"}

'' \nAnderson , rightly , identifies the US killing of 17 demonstrators in Fallujah about two weeks after the famous fall of the Saddam statue as a `` historic watershed '' . \nThe Iraqis took their revenge , and by the end of the spring `` it was becoming clear that the Americans were faced with an intensifying guerrilla insurgency in Iraq '' . \nA problem with too many books written by journalists about war is that they tend to be mainly about the journalists and less about the population that is suffering . \nAnderson does write probably too much about his colleagues but he also writes movingly about the general population and the suffering . \nOn a visit to a hospital , an Iraqi doctor introduces him to 12-year-old Ali , a victim of the war . \nHis torso is blackened and both his arms burned off . \nHis stumps `` looked like something that might be found in a barbecue pit '' . \nDid he like sports ? \nYes , volleyball and soccer . \nHis mother and father and one of his brothers had been killed , but he had not yet been told . \nOn the whole , though , there is not enough in the book about the Iraqis , especially the poorest , in part because western journalists ' contact with the Iraqi population was often so difficult . \nThere was a brief window of a few months immediately after the war when it was possible for western journalists to travel anywhere and talk openly to almost anyone but Anderson , understandably given he had just covered the war in Iraq , had gone home for most of this period . \nA definitive account of the innermost life of Iraqis before , during and since the war has still to be written , and maybe it will require an Iraqi rather than a western journalist to write it . \nClare Short 's book is not directly about the Iraqis . \nIt deals with the still contentious way in which Tony Blair and his government , of which she was a part , took Britain to war alongside the US . \nSome politicians can make money from their books by selling publication rights to newspa pers , an expensive but easy source of `` exclusives '' . \nOne of the problems with Short 's combined biography and rant against Blair 's administration is that there is little that is exclusive . \nWe already know she feels duped by Blair over the war - the `` honorable deception '' - and the extent of feuding between Blair and Gordon Brown , and the British bugging of Kofi Annan . \nThis lack of news interest is a back-handed compliment . \nShe was always too honest and open , whether in the Commons or in front of a newspaper reporter or a BBC microphone . \nShe did not hold back to ensure largesse when the rights to her book went out to auction . \nHer diary entries , though sparse , form the best part of the book . \nThere is an immediacy about them , the views not influenced by hindsight , particularly her references to Brown , whom she would like to see replace Blair . \nHer critique is that the US and Britain rushed to war in Iraq with unseemly haste and for the wrong reasons . \nShe recalls various conversations with Blair and concludes that he seemed to have been manipulating her , making promises to keep her on side and to delay her resignation , a postponement that damaged her credibility . \nShe , too , may have been at fault , hearing what she wanted to hear , not wanting to lose her beloved department . \nBut her verdict on him is uncompromising : `` The question is , does Tony Blair even realize that he so often gives promises and breaks his word and has so little respect for the truth ? '' \nHer public opposition to the war angered colleagues , who accused her of being sanctimonious and undisciplined . \nBut she was saying in public and to Blair what many of them thought privately but were not prepared to say , either publicly or to Blair . \nby Clare Short This article appeared on p12 of the Guardian review section of the Guardian on 01.35 GMT on Saturday 12 February 2005 Latest news and views from the Guardian 's books team paullaity : Read this : clever and funny and rightly cutting . \n"}

'' \nThe play is a monologue , a tapestry of Sheehan 's letters to Bush and Fo 's invention . \nThe actor Frances de la Tour performs with script in hand - this was billed as work-in-progress . \nFo has been sending additions and revisions until the eleventh hour . \nDe la Tour 's rich contralto rings out ; a contrast with Sheehan 's fluting , soft soprano . \nSheehan sits in the audience next to Fo and Rame . \nHer usual beatific smile remains intact . \nBut when de la Tour delivers the line : `` About a month after his death I said to myself : I 've had enough of crying for my own son , now I 'm going to cry for all mothers , '' her tears fall . \nIn the row in front , vigorous anti-war campaigner Jeremy Corbyn , MP for Islington north , rests his eyes . \nThe play is funny and touching ; but not very gay . \nAfterwards , Sheehan and de la Tour entwine hands . \n`` Frances did an amazing job of conveying my feeling of anger and betrayal , especially when she said what I wrote to Barbara Bush , '' says Sheehan . \n`` Casey was honorable and brave and sweet and he was murdered by the Bush family . '' \nKustow hopes that when de la Tour goes to Broadway in the spring to act in Alan Bennett 's The History Boys they can stage the play in New York , and he would like to produce it on TV . \nMany strange things have happened to Sheehan since her son was killed on April 4 2004 , but surely few can match the surprise that she received a few days ago when she learned that a Nobel-prizewinning playwright had written a monologue based on her letters to George Bush , that she was to watch it in a school hall in London , and that it would performed by one of the English-speaking world 's great actors . \n`` My whole life is surreal and bizarre , '' she said . \n`` I hope the play can be used as an anti-war tool , to put a human face on this war , to show Casey had a life , was a person .

There were plans during the cold war to evacuate major cities in a few days . '' \nProfessor Dumas added that not enough provision seemed to have been made for poor people . \n`` There does n't seem to have been much attention paid to people who did n't have private automobiles , '' he said . \n`` I did n't hear anything about school buses or city buses being used to aim people out of town . '' \nHe said that there appeared to be little forward planning to cater to those on low incomes who would be unable to return to their homes for up to two months but who would not have the money to pay for that time in a hotel . \n`` The Department of Homeland Security says on its website that it deals with natural disasters , '' he said . \n`` They do n't seem to have done a very good job . \nThere does n't seem to have been any long-term planning . '' \nThe war in Iraq was also being seen as playing a part in the federal response to the crisis . \nMany members of the National Guard who would normally have been swiftly mobilised to help in evacuation are on duty in Iraq . \nAlthough US air force , navy and army units were deployed to assist , the locally-based National Guard is depleted by the demands of the war . \nNew Orleans , which is in a natural basin on the Mississippi floodplain , is on average about six feet below sea level and theoretically protected by the most sophisticated levee system in the world . \nAccording to the US corps of army engineers , which is responsible for maintaining flood defences , more than 1,200 miles of levees and floodwalls have been built to protect the city from the Mississippi and from hurricanes . \nThe corps has long wanted to strengthen some of the levees which have been sinking , and on its website yesterday said it planned to build a further 74 miles of hurricane defences . \nBut according to local media , it was last year refused extra funding by the White House which wanted to save money to pay for homeland security against terrorism . \n`` In its budget , the Bush administration proposed a significant reduction in funding for south-east Louisiana 's chief hurricane protection project . \nBush proposed $ 10.4 m , a sixth of what local officials say they need , '' reported Newhouse News Service yesterday . \nLocal officials are saying , the article claimed , that had Washington heeded warnings about the dire need for extra hurricane protection , including building up levees and repairing barrier islands , `` the damage might not have been nearly as bad as it turned out to be '' . \nLast year Walter Maestri , emergency chief for Jefferson Parish , Louisiana , one of the worst affected areas , reportedly told the Times-Picayune newspaper : `` It appears that the money -LRB- for strengthening levees against hurricanes -RRB- has been moved in the president 's budget to handle homeland security and the war in Iraq , and I suppose that 's the price we pay . \nNobody locally is happy that the levees ca n't be finished , and we are doing everything we can to make the case that this is a security issue for us . '' \nIn June 2004 , the corps ' project manager , Al Naomi , went before a local agency , the East Jefferson Levee Authority , and requested $ 2m for `` urgent work '' that Washington was now unable to pay for . \n`` The levees are sinking , '' he said . \n`` Everything is sinking , and if we do n't get the money fast enough to raise them , then we ca n't stay ahead of the settlement .

'' \nIt was all over in minutes . \nHe was released without bail , `` under his own cognisance '' , and left his legal team and his wife waiting in a corridor while he was photographed and fingerprinted in the marshal 's office in the basement . \nThe entourage then walked out into a pack of journalists and television cameras waiting at a side entrance , where Mr Libby 's newly hired defense lawyer , Ted Wells , a frequent player in past administration scandals , voiced the fallen official 's defiance . \n`` Mr Libby has pleaded not guilty to each and every count in the indictment , '' Mr Wells said . \n`` In pleading not guilty he has declared to the world that he is innocent . \nHe has declared he intends to fight the charges in the indictment , and he has declared that he wants to clear his good name , and he wants a jury trial . '' \nThe Libbys were bundled into a black limousine , and began the long wait for the trial . \nIt is not clear what Mr Libby plans to do now . \nHe once voiced a longing to get away from it all in Crete to drink `` odd-named wines '' and pursue his other vocation as a novelist . \nHe published an exotic and erotic tale called The Apprentice , set in Japan a century ago and featuring young girls being raped by bears . \n"}

'' \nNewton said many celebrities have been wary of going because they think it might be seen that they are endorsing the war . \n`` And I say it 's not . \nI tell them these men and women are over there because our country sent them , and we have the absolute necessity to try to bring them as much happiness as we can . '' \nFear is also a factor . \n`` They 're scared , '' country singer Craig Morgan , who is in Iraq on the USO 's Hope and Freedom Tour 2005 , told USA Today . \n`` It 's understandable . \nIt 's not a safe and fun place and a lot of people do n't want to take the chance . '' \nThe USO was founded in 1941 as a way of boosting morale for the military . \nFor most of that time Bob Hope , who made his first appearance in 1942 and his last in 1990 , was its most recognisable face , famed for putting on Christmas extravaganzas on aircraft carriers and American bases during the Vietnam war . \nThousands of performers signed up to play the `` foxhole circuit '' during the second world war , but the USO has a much smaller list . \nSome of the entertainers still willing to travel are die-hard true believers - rock musician Ted Nugent carried a Glock handgun to shows in Iraq last year and said in a radio interview that he manned a machine gun on a Humvee . \nBut many of the USO 's regular performers are fierce critics of the war , among them the comic and star of Good Morning Vietnam , Robin Williams , who told USA Today he would like to return to the Middle East in the spring for what would be his fourth tour since 2002 . \n`` I 'm there for the -LRB- troops -RRB- , not for W , '' he said in a reference to the president . \n`` Go , man . \nYou wo n't forget it . \nYou 'll meet amazing people , '' is his message to stars that ask him about the tours . \nBut the comedian said he mostly tries to keep politics out of the show after he did a few jokes about Bush 's brainpower at a base in 2003 and got a chilly reception . \nOther critics of the war who regularly perform include the leftwing comedian Al Franken -LRB- who is headlining the current tour along with Christian hip-hop group Souljahz -RRB- and the punk legend and actor Henry Rollins , one of the Bush administrations most vocal critics . \nThe tradition of beautiful women thrilling the troops has continued - although while Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell showed up in Korea and Vietnam could boast Raquel Welch , in Iraq they have had to make do with sometime pop singer and reality TV star Jessica Simpson . \n"}

'' \nMr Khashoggi predicted the approach of the Saudi government towards jihadists returning from Iraq will be very different from those returning from Afghanistan and Chechnya . \n`` Any al-Qaida coming back from Iraq will be hunted . \nIt is not like they have gone to Chechnya and will be coming back as heroes . \nIf they come back from Iraq and brag about it , they will be snatched by security in a day or two . '' \nThe CIA report suggests the new breed of jihadists will be more deadly than those who fought in Afghanistan . \nIt said that they have learned skills in urban warfare in Iraq . \nWhile the number of Iraq attacks have diminished , they have become more deadly . \nMore than 1,000 Iraqis and 120 US soldiers have been killed since the new Iraqi cabinet was formed in April . \nInsurgents once again demonstrated their capacity for inflicting carnage on civilians when they detonated four cars bombs in western Baghdad last night , killing at least 23 people and injuring around 50 . \nAt least one was driven by a suicide bomber . \nEarlier a bomb attack on a US military patrol killed three civilians . \nIt was claimed by the al-Qaida group led by Abu Musab al Zarqawi . \nThere are about 200 individuals in Britain who are suspected of having received training in camps in Afghanistan and Chechnya . \nSenior anti-terrorist officials suggest many fewer have gone to Iraq . \nKen Jones , the chairman of the Association of Chief Police Officers ' terrorism committee and chief constable of Sussex , said yesterday Britain would remain a prime target . \n`` There is an inevitable targeting of the United Kingdom and UK interests abroad , '' Mr Jones told a conference on terrorism organised by the Royal United Services Institute in London . \n`` The threat will endure for the foreseeable future . '' \nBut he added : `` it is not inevitable that they will succeed . '' \nMr Jones noted that those involved in terrorism no longer necessarily came from the `` excluded and marginalised '' but were increasingly `` highly intelligent , educated young people '' . \nIn past terrorist campaigns , he said , there had been a clear goal or aim . \nThe new form of attacks required a different response . \nOne of the most important ways to combat the growth of terrorism , he suggested , was by encouraging `` confident communities '' - a clear reference to Britain 's Muslims - that would be aware of suspicious activities and would feel confident in reporting them . \nPolice in Manchester were last night given another 48 hours to question a 40-year-old man of north African origin , who was arrested under the Terrorism Act on Tuesday . \nIt is believed that the man had shared a house in Moss Side with Idris Bazis , 41 , a French-Algerian with a French passport , who blew himself up in a suicide attack in Iraq in February . \nAnti-terrorist sources say there is no link between the Manchester arrest and recent arrests of 11 men in Spain suspected of being connected with the Iraq insurgency . \nParents of 17 British soldiers killed in Iraq called today in a letter to The Guardian for an independent inquiry into the decision to go to war in Iraq . \n"}

'' \nHere comes the twist : Corrigan lives in Tony Blair 's constituency of Sedgefield . \nAt the last election , he voted for the prime minister ; this time he will vote for Reg Keys , father of Lance Corporal Tom Keys , who was horribly killed along with five other Royal Military Policemen in Iraq in June 2003 . \n`` And if Reg was n't standing , '' says Corrigan , `` I would n't vote at all . '' \nWhile families have spoken out , the voices of soldiers who served in - let alone were wounded in - the war in Iraq are seldom heard . \nEarlier this year the MoD refused requests by the Guardian to interview casualties . \nAt one point , the authorities of the hospital in which most of the 900 wounded in Iraq are treated , at Selly Oak in Birmingham , were happy for the Guardian to visit a ward where military and civilian casualties are treated alongside one another . \nBut the MoD has vetoedtheir permission . \nBut Corrigan has now - finally - been medically discharged from the territorial army to which he has devoted most of his life , `` and now that I can , I want to speak for the lads out there . \nLet 's face it , there are a lot of lads in a much worse position than me . \nAnd there are many more who feel even angrier than I do about it all . '' \nCorrigan joined the TA , attached to the 4th Parachute Regiment , in 1983 . \nHe was named champion recruit and promoted to full corporal within three years . \nFrom 1989 to 1991 , he served as a regular , professional paratrooper , but resumed his territorial status in order to study for a degree in sports sciences . \nHe commuted from County Durham to Nottingham in order to `` stay airborne '' with the paras . \nBy 2001 , Corrigan was working as an ambulance technician , and `` changed my cap badge '' to the Royal Army Medical Corps , 144 Parachute Medical Squadron . \nAs such , mobilisation to Iraq was compul sory - TA medical personnel are subject to conscription . \nOn his birthday , March 22 2003 , Corrigan `` went through the breach '' from Kuwait into southern Iraq as a field ambulance commander with the 16th Air Assault Brigade . \n`` I was proud to be there . \nI was serving my country , and I was doing good ; putting kids into the back of my ambulance with no limbs . '' \nOn the night of April 8 came a vicious fire fight at Adaiya , in southern Iraq . \nCorrigan 's regiment took 25 casualties in 45 minutes . \nDuring a frantic operation to treat the injured - `` I 'll never forget chest-draining one soldier ; we saved his life '' - Corrigan fell from the ambulance , badly damaging his knee . \nHe was evacuated back to RAF Halton , near Luton . \nThere , what he calls his `` nightmare '' began . \nNo one had told Corrigan 's wife that he was injured , let alone back . \nAfter a two-minute examination , he was , according to his papers , `` discharged to care of civil GP '' - although mobilised TA soldiers are subject to the same care as regular soldiers , until discharged . \nCorrigan , carrying 100lb of battle kit , had to hitch-hike as far as Catterick , Yorkshire , then get a friend to take him home to Newton Aycliffe , County Durham . \nThere followed a litany of neglect . \nA baffled local GP referred him to the military wing of the Duchess of Kent hospital in Catterick -LRB- he had to organise and pay for all his own transport -RRB- where he was booked in for an operation three months hence . \nHe demanded one immediately and got it : most of the cartilage was removed . \nBut the knee worsened , and a second operation five months later revealed a huge tear in his cartilage . \nDespite this , Corrigan was declared fit for a tough rehabilitation course at Catterick , in November 2003 , with a view to returning to Iraq . \nAfter three weeks of agony , his knee was so bad he was finally demobilised , in February 2004 . \nIt was only when he appeared in front of a medical board in York in August that anyone in the army acknowledged the extent of the neglect . \nThe board 's president , retired colonel Jimmy Weir , wrote a memo on the history of the case , saying Corrigan had become `` desperate '' and was `` at the end of his tether '' . \nBy now , Corrigan had been forced to seek help privately , paying Bupa # 2,100 for a third operation in October 2004 , which removed the remains of the cartilage and found a crack in the patella . \nIt also confirmed grade four osteo-arthritis , which had been spotted but ignored during the first , military , operation . \nThe injury and subsequent neglect have dashed Corrigan 's professional ambitions in the ambulance service . \nDespite glowing references and the promise of promotion to full paramedic status , his employer , the North East Ambulance Trust , has had to restrict his activities : he can not work at accident scenes , lift patients or drive for longer than 20 minutes . \nShortly after the third operation , Corrigan wrote to Blair . \nThe PM 's agent , John Burton , passed on the case to the defense secretary , Geoff Hoon , on December 15 2004 . \n`` We have other cases of this coming from TA soldiers , and we find it worrying , '' added Burton . \nHoon replied to Blair on February 22 this year , apologising `` that adequate transport arrangements were not provided '' for Corrigan , and authorising backdated disability allowance that had not been paid . \nCorrigan called the response `` pathetic '' . \n`` I 've asked three times to see Tony Blair , '' he says , `` but it has n't happened . \nI 'm surprised actually - I 'm the only injured soldier in his constituency and he could have turned all this to his account . \nBut then , one of the amazing things is that Blair and Hoon have made no effort to visit the wounded , have they , not even in hospital ? \nI think that 's disgusting . '' \nCorrigan has formed strong views on his local MP . \n`` I 'm happy to serve my country , but for the right reasons . \nI 've been amazed by all this that 's coming out in the news , about how it was all a lie , that there were no weapons , that it was illegal . \nI 'm prepared to fight , but not because someone is so far up Bush 's rear end . \nHe still ca n't accept it , can he ? \nI think he believes his own lies . \nHe seems to have brainwashed himself . '' \nIn Iraq , he says , `` it 's become horrendous . \nMy friend who died just could n't stand it any more . \nWe should n't be there and we should n't have gone there . \nI think it 's important that someone like me says that . \nI think there should be someone who was a soldier saying that , not someone in a suit and tie , saying it for their own ends , but saying it for the sake of the men and women left out there ; that they should n't be there , fighting an unjust war that was lied over .

{"id": "17", "time": "2005-02-14", "text": "Monday 14 February 2005 01.50 GMT Short of improbable developments in the courts , foxhunting will become illegal in England on Friday . \nMany people reading this will , no doubt , be pleased , but I suggest that the left might pause before gloating and wipe any smiles off their faces . \nThis is a very nasty piece of political work indeed and what it says about the Labor party is truly horrible . \nBy now all the arguments about hunting have been exhausted , but one point needs to be made for one last time . \nHunting is morally indefensible in strict ethical terms , but no more so than angling , which is in some ways more objectionable . \nThere is , of course , the supra-ethical difference that only a quarter of a million people hunt , very few of them Labor voters , whereas 4 million people fish , and their votes are desperately needed by the government , not to say by individual Labor MPs . \nAttempts to explain this away have a wonderfully hollow ring . \nAlun Michael , the minister responsible for passing the hunting ban , has said the only tests that matter are `` cruelty and utility '' . \nAlan Milburn has been recalled to the government to mastermind the election campaign and has said on the radio , with an audible smirk , that hunting is different from fishing because foxes ca n't be eaten . \nEven he may be aware that by far the largest part of recreational fishing in this country is what is called competition angling , catching harmless and specifically inedible coarse fish by sheer volume . \nThis pastime has neither culinary nor environmental justification of any kind , and has been called pure sadism . \nLet me leave it there , while asking Michael , Milburn or any other member of the government to defend competition angling in terms of cruelty and utility . \nAll this is by the way , since everyone must recognize by now that the hunting controversy long ago took on a life of its own and ceased to be debated in any real terms of right or wrong . \nIts true importance lies the role it has come to play in Labor politics , and above all in the squalid , and frankly humiliating , relationship between Tony Blair and his party . \nFor Labor MPs , hunting has become a displacement activity , a means in which they try to persuade themselves - against all evidence - that they still belong to a radical movement . \nFor the government it has been a vital sop to buy off discontent in the ranks , up to and including the most appalling betrayal of what the party once stood for . \nIt is of real historical significance that this ban has not come about under what anyone can honestly call a government of the left . \nBy any objective standards , New Labor is a centre-right party , and it is hard to argue with Martin Jacques when he says that Blair personally stands to the right of every postwar prime minister apart from his heroine , Margaret Thatcher . \nHence , in its roundabout way , the importance of this one irrelevant issue . \nHence also the way that political defences of the ban backfire . \nThe Labor MP Peter Bradley has said that it `` is not about the politics of envy but the politics of power '' . \nThis was misrepresented by the Tory press as a declaration of class war . \nOthers , too , were happy to pick up his torch : `` There 's nothing like a bit of class war , '' said one Guardian writer . \nThis is n't class war as Kautsky and Lenin understood it , or Hardie and Bevan . \nLet us never forget the guiding principle of our present rulers : `` New Labor is intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich . '' \nNo one could accuse Peter Mandelson of ambiguity when he said that , nor deny that his party has lived up to that precept . \nThe Blair government worships money and adores the rich , something Labor MPs try ineffectually to disguise when they attack the traditional -LRB- though long since eclipsed -RRB- values and mores of the old gentry . \nClass conflict has given way to `` culture wars '' , and hunting is a cultural and not a political question . \nIt certainly has nothing to do with left and right , unless one were to suppose that the `` Blairite loyalist '' and fanatical exponent of the hunting ban Sir Gerald Kaufman is further to the left of that hard man to hounds Friedrich Engels , which does n't seem very likely . \nAll that is overshadowed by Blair 's sordid dealings with the party he leads but which has never really liked him . \nWhen the prime minister returned from sojourning in Bermuda last year to announce his ludicrous volte-face on the European referendum , he is supposed to have told a colleague : `` I 'm going to have a lot of shit to eat '' . \nMaybe so , but nothing compared with the diet he has imposed on his party for the past 10 years , that mighty coprophagic banquet , that great orgy of ordure . \nOver and again , and to a degree quite unprecedented in political history , Labor MPs have been ordered to support ministers they despised and vote for measures they have detested . \nThe cut in benefit for single parents mattered much less economically than psychologically . \nWith that , Blair showed that he had completely broken the will of his MPs , who would thereafter accept anything - even a war that almost none of them wanted . \nAt the same time , hunting was brought back at regular intervals to propitiate the resentful and self-hating parliamentary party . \nMany people , among them Jackie Ashley and Polly Toynbee on these pages , have asked the same thing : why on earth was so much time spent on hunting when parliament had so many more important questions to deal with ? \nBut that has been answered by another eminent political journalist . \nFor those who do n't know the figures , by the way , more than 700 hours of parliamentary time were devoted to the hunting ban , as against seven hours spent on the decision to invade Iraq , a comparison that sums up the way we are governed . \nOn the evening the ban was passed , Martha Kearney on Newsnight described the political background , and the government 's motives last year in taking up the hunting bill once again . \nAs she said quite matter-of-factly , `` it was brought back to restore morale after the war in Iraq '' . \nSo there you have it . \nThis was a crust thrown to Labor MPs to thank them for supporting an unnecessary , illegal and immoral war , which Blair took this country into simply to demonstrate his uncritical loyalty to the most reactionary American president in living memory , and which has killed at least 20,000 and possibly 100,000 innocent people . \nAs the election approaches , with a further drop in turn-out all too likely , politicians are wondering why they are so widely despised . \nHere is their answer . \nBlair got his war , Labor got their hunting ban . \nI hope it makes them all happy . \nGeoffrey Wheatcroft 's book , The Strange Death of Tory England , will be published next month Letters for publication should be sent to : letters@guardian.co.uk If you need help using the site : userhelp@guardian.co.uk Call the main Guardian and Observer switchboard : This article was published on guardian . \n"}

'' \nOthers called on the incoming government to play fairly with minorities . \nNew Zealand 's prime minister , Helen Clark , told the country 's Newstalk ZB radio station that those elected had to make sure the Iraqi government was `` inclusive '' . \n`` The key to Iraq 's future is going to be whether the largest group can accommodate satisfactorily the interests of the two smaller groups , the Sunnis and the Kurds , '' she said . \nBut the Turkish foreign ministry said in a statement that voter turnout in some regions was low and charged that there were `` imbalanced results '' in several regions , including Kirkuk . \nTurkey has long complained that Kurdish groups are illegally moving Kurds into Kirkuk , a strategic northern city , in an effort to tip the city 's population balance in their favor . \n"}

'' \nHis colleague is thought not to be seriously injured . \nThe war in Iraq has been high on the general election agenda for the past week , and the death of a soldier so close to polling day will add to the pressure on Tony Blair . \nDetails of the attack emerged as insurgents continued their onslaught on Baghdad , with four car bombs killing 14 people yesterday on the eve of the swearing-in of the Iraqi government cabinet . \nExplosions shook the capital for a fifth consecutive day , and civilians again bore the brunt of attacks ; at least 127 people have been killed since a new administration was formed last week . \nNine people died when a van packed with explosives blew up in a mixed Shia and Sunni shopping district , hurling glass and debris across the street . \nThe defense secretary , Geoff Hoon , said yesterday that Guardsman Wakefield 's death had come on what had been expected to be a routine operation . \nHe was the first British serviceman killed in action since January , and the 87th to die since March 2003 . \nLast year Amara , on the Tigris near the Iranian border , saw fierce fighting between the city 's 1,000-strong British garrison and the Mahdi army militia of a radical Shia cleric , Moqtada al-Sadr , who led two uprisings against the US-led occupation . \nSince a ceasefire agreed last August , attacks on British troops had dwindled to just a few small-scale efforts each week that until Sunday caused no casualties . \nAmara is 90 % Shia , and its residents turned out in force for the election that gave Shias their first taste of power in decades . \nMr Blair , speaking in London at Labor 's election news conference , said he offered his `` profound condolences '' to Guardsman Wakefield 's family . \nThe prime minister said his death `` underlines once again the extraordinary work and sacrifice that British armed forces are making in Iraq , to help Iraq become a stable and democratic country that 's no longer a threat to its region and the world '' . \nThe Conservative leader , Michael Howard , expressed his `` deep sympathy and sincere condolences '' to Guardsman Wakefield 's family , and the Liberal Democrat deputy leader , Sir Menzies Campbell , said : `` It 's a reminder that we have 8,000 young men and women in Iraq who expose themselves to danger on a daily basis . '' \nYesterday Guardsman Wakefield 's seven-year-old son Scott stood to attention in his pyjamas on the doorstep of the family home in Newcastle upon Tyne . \nIn a trembling voice he said : `` I am proud of my daddy ; he served his country and he died a hero . '' \nHis mother , Ann Toward , 30 , told how she had been told of her husband 's death early yesterday . \n`` I heard a knock at the door at 3.30 this morning and knew instantly what had happened , '' she said . \n`` I answered the door to a man in a smart suit who handed me his card saying he was from the MoD . \nI invited him in and he broke the news ... I am devastated and shocked . \n`` He was such a brave man , I had two children with him and I am trying to explain to them that their dad wo n't be coming home . \nIt is very , very hard , it is only just beginning to sink in . '' \nMs Toward last night blamed the prime minister for her husband 's death . \nSpeaking on the ITV News Channel , she said Mr Blair had deprived her three children of their father . \n`` He sent the troops over and he should not have done it . \nIf it was not for that , their dad would have been here today . '' \nBesides Scott and Corey , two , Guardsman Wakefield also had a stepdaughter Stacey , 11 , from Ms Toward 's previous relationship . \nMs Toward added : `` It is only just beginning to sink in for Scott , he has been talking about his dad and wants to write him a letter to tell him how proud he is that he fought and died for his country . \nHe had been in the army for six years . '' \nThe couple had been married for two years , but were in the process of separating . \nMs Toward said that she remembered her husband as a `` wonderful , fun , happy man - we were so close it was only the amount of time he was away that took its toll . '' \nA classified version of the US report into the shooting of Italian agent Nicola Calipari , killed escorting the freed Italian journalist Giuliana Sgrena to safety , last night revealed the true strength of the insur gency , writes Gary Younge . \nA computer error enabled readers to remove blacked out parts of the document by simply cutting and pasting . \nConfidential elements of the report revealed that , `` from 1 November 2004 to 12 March 2005 there were a total of 3,306 attacks in the Baghdad area . \nOf these , 2,400 were directed against Coalition Forces '' . \n"}
{"id": "176", "time": "2005-05-03", "text": "Tuesday 3 May 2005 19.30 BST The 2005 general election campaign has been a defective democratic event in many ways . \nYet beneath the surface there has echoed a national conversation of passion and seriousness . \nThoughtful people have debated for months with families , friends and colleagues - and with themselves - about how to vote in this contest . \nMuch of the electorate is still undecided . \nIt is an imperfect choice conducted under the imperfect electoral system which is nevertheless the only one that we have got . \nWhat to do on Thursday ? \nLet 's be honest : it is difficult . \nThis newspaper 's answer to this unshirkable question involves taking the long and broad view . \nWhile 2005 will be remembered as Tony Blair 's Iraq election , May 5 is not a referendum on that one decision , however fateful , or on the person who led it , however controversial . \nLike all others , this election must in the end come down to a verdict between the candidates and parties that will produce a parliament and a government . \nYet Iraq overhangs this election for many . \nIt is the issue that makes them most squeamish about voting Labor . \nThe decision to bend this country 's foreign and defense policy quite so pliantly to US imperatives has taken a terrible toll on public confidence in the way this country is run . \nIt has been a dreadful distraction from other priorities , of which climate change is the most important . \nIt is the root cause of an equally destructive toll on Mr Blair 's public standing and of a wounded anger that has haunted this campaign all the way to May 5 . \nBut does this mean that we recommend a vote against Labor ? \nNearly a century ago , the great editor of this newspaper , CP Scott , reflected in this column on an approaching election in terms that are as relevant today as they were then . \nAs a result of three-cornered contests , Scott wrote : `` It is quite possible that while Liberalism and Labor are snapping and snarling at each other the Conservative dog may run away with the bone . \nThat would be lamentable . '' \nIf such an outcome would have been lamentable in the early 20th century , it would be just as lamentable in the early 21st . \nThe Conservative party is the worst answer to what is wrong with Britain . \nImmediately this is because of the damaging and divisive campaign on immigration that Michael Howard has run this time . \nFor this reason alone , it is vital to stop the Conservatives . \nBut there is a longer term reason too . \nEight years on from 1997 , the Tory party has not rethought what it wants to offer the British people in the 21st century . \nUntil it does , it does not deserve to be elected . \nCP Scott speaks across the century on other matters too . \nScott spent much of his life arguing for what he described as the `` reunion '' of the `` party of progress '' . \nToday , that division remains a reality . \nEight years ago , on the eve of the 1997 election , we described ourselves as recognizing `` without embarrassment or apology that we , the Liberal Democrats and the Labor party are companions on the journey down the same broad river of progressive politics '' . \nIn 2005 , though we have all been tumbled about by some rapids , that remains true . \nThe modern progressive consensus of which Gordon Brown speaks will be the work not of one party alone , but of two . \nIn that general sense , therefore , we would not be true to this newspaper 's deep traditions if we saw anything wrong in principle with a switch of allegiance between the two progressive parties in 2005 . \nPeople must vote their conscience , and there are powerful reasons for casting one 's vote for the Liberal Democrats this time . \nThis is especially the case because the Liberal Democrats opposed the Iraq war , as this newspaper also did . \nBut it is also because the Liberal Democrats have been vigilant and rational in their defense of individual liberty since September 11 2001 . \nThe party at least grasps , as many in Labor do not , that fairness , liberty and the law are not merely pieces on a political chessboard , to be sacrificed in some cold-blooded trade-off with the need for security , but are also part of the soul and identity of this nation . \nIt may be , indeed , that the time is approaching when the Liberal Democrats will be electorally powerful enough , politically coherent enough and well enough led to be considered as a true party of government . \nThat depends partly on Labor and partly on the Liberal Democrats themselves . \nIf and when it happens , we look forward to it . \nBut that time is not yet and not now . \nThere is too much that is unconvincing about Liberal Democrat thinking on too many important subjects . \nThe party needs to stare more unflinchingly at the possibility and reality of power than it has yet done . \nThat is not something one can now say about Labor . \nLabor has become comfortable in power . \nThere are alarming , unattractive and plain unacceptable aspects of this , many of them embodied in the way Mr Blair took us to war . \nIf there was one general overarching change we would demand from Labor in the parliament to come it is that it should better respect the visible and invisible lines of the separation of powers in British government : the centrality of parliament , the importance of cabinet , the independence of the judges , the indispensable role of independent scrutiny and audit . \nOurs is not a presidential system . \nYet Labor 's comfort with power has strengths too , and no one feels them more than the millions who have little voice in the running of any aspect of modern Britain . \nLabor this week stands on the threshold of something it has never achieved : a third successive working majority in parliament . \nIt stands there because , over the past 11 years Mr Blair and Mr Brown have systematically forced the party to rethink itself . \nAs a result Labor has left behind the era of unheroic failure and has made itself the master of the era of steady , incremental success . \nMillions of people owe essential parts of their present prosperity and greater opportunities to Labor 's methodical investment in the public services and the common realm . \nIt is too easy sometimes to overlook the real substance of what Labor has achieved in these years . \nIn the first place , it has built a stable economic platform - low inflation , sustained growth , low unemployment - which makes everything else possible and which would be at great risk under any other government . \nSecond , it is on the way to winning the argument about the need for public service investment that is the cornerstone of all possibility of real social justice . \nHaving started the work in rebuilding the health service , investing in schools and modestly redistributing , Labor has a powerful case for now going further , exemplified by the plans for early years support for young families . \nIt is the most redistributive of all the main parties and it deserves support on that count alone . \nThere is much to regret about the eight years of Labor government - the missed opportunities , among which Europe stands out , the enduring fear of offending corporate vested interests , the underestimate of what could have been achieved amidst the national and international goodwill of the early years , the sometimes disabling effect of the frequently formidable Blair-Brown relationship . \nAbove all there has been the visible transformation of the prime minister himself from a figure of almost limitless modern social-democratic possibilities and gifts to a widely disrespected leader whose political shelf-life is now clearly - and rightly - limited . \nMr Blair 's recent career has illustrated the wisdom of the late Roy Jenkins , one of the great losses to British life since 2001 , who observed that no political leader can - or should - continue at the top for more than a decade . \nWe believe that Mr Blair should be re-elected to lead Labor into a third term this week . \nBut the spotlight of the election has underlined that he was right to pledge not to seek a fourth . \nWe do not call for him to be elected on Thursday and step down on Friday ; apart from anything else , that would be a betrayal of the democratic verdict . \nBut we do not think it is in many interests for Mr Blair to hang on longer than is politically expedient . \nWe are not uncritical of Mr Brown or whoever else succeeds him . \nIn his final days our late colleague Hugo Young , another vast loss to liberal Britain , quoted the admonition of the psalm not to put one 's trust in princes . \nWe shall remember those words . \nIn the end an election is about choosing a government and a parliament . \nWe are clear where we stand , in spite of our misgivings . \nWe want to see Labor re-elected to government and we want to see more Liberal Democrats returned to parliament , at whichever other party 's expense . \nWhat we do not want are more Tory MPs , so we therefore urge progressive voters in the overwhelming majority of Labor or Liberal Democrat held seats to rally behind the incumbent party . \nOnly in a tiny handful of seats - see elsewhere in today 's paper - is it safe for Labor voters to switch to the Liberal Democrats without the risk of allowing the Tories to win . \nElsewhere , think very carefully before you vote . \nYou are voting not just for yourself but for others , frequently less fortunate , whose life chances rest on your good sense . \nCP Scott would have understood such dilemmas . \nThe difficulty arises , he once wrote , `` not from the nature of things but from the defects of our electoral system '' . \nThat is as true today as it was 100 years ago . \nReform of that system must be part of the agenda for any future progressive consensus . \nIn the absence of reform , however , voters should use their heads and hearts to re-elect Labor with an increased Liberal Democrat presence . \n"}
{"id": "41", "time": "2005-06-24", "text": "Two years on , the echoes of Vietnam are getting louder As the Iraq insurgency grows , so do the similarities with Indochina Friday 24 June 2005 00.02 BST A year after the Iraq insurgency began in 2003 , sceptics asked : `` Is this the new Vietnam ? '' \nAt the time , many of us who pontificate about these things answered no. . \nSimplistic historical comparisons are almost always mistaken . \nIt seemed premature to pass any melodramatic judgment about Iraq . \nToday , another year on , important differences persist . \nThe US commitment in Iraq is much smaller than in Vietnam , and so is the casualty rate . \nHalf a million Americans spent five years pursuing victory in Indochina , and five more disengaging . \n`` Only '' 140,000 US soldiers are deployed in Iraq . \nGeorge Bush is likely to declare victory and start getting out , rather than escalate his war as Lyndon Johnson so disastrously did . \nYet in significant respects Vietnam comparisons have become unavoidable . \nFirst , it is hard to believe that Washington 's objective - the creation of a viable local government and institutions to run Iraq as a unitary state - is achievable within an acceptable time-frame . \nSecond , intelligence is proving a critical weakness . \nRecently , I heard an American commander deplore the extraordinary paucity of information on the ground : `` We spend all these billions of dollars on the CIA and your SIS , and we know next to nothing about what the other side is doing . \nWe need less technology and more spies . '' \nThird , and most important , whatever military successes American forces achieve against the insurgents , there is no sign that they are winning the critical battle , for hearts and minds . \nThe experience of ordinary Iraqis with the US military is at best alienating , at worst terrifying . \nThere is no hint of shared purpose , mutual sympathy and respect between the armored columns rolling along the roads , intermittently belching fire , and the hapless mass of local people , caring only for survival . \nLast month , BBC4 screened an uncommonly vivid documentary , A Company of Soldiers , about a unit of the US 8th Cavalry fighting in Iraq . \nIt brought all the old memories of Vietnam flooding back . \nThese shaven-headed young philistines , fearful and even sometimes tearful , wore on their arms the horse 's head badge of a formation I knew in Indochina as the 1st Air Cavalry Division . \nAs the 8th Cavalry 's armored vehicles roared forth on patrol , their occupants seemed infused with the same bewilderment about an unknown enemy that one remembered so well in the boondocks of Indochina . \nThese soldiers ' view of Iraq was determined by what they could glimpse through their weapon slits , or at night on their infra-red screens . \n`` We 're trying to save their lives , '' said an exasperated officer about the Iraqis , `` but they 're not helping us by getting in our way . '' \nSoldiers quizzing local people through interpreters on a house search are young men from Ohio or Wyoming , Georgia or New Jersey . \nYet cocooned in helmets and sunglasses , body armor and weapons that conceal almost every inch of flesh , they do not seem human at all . \nThey resemble the robot legionaries of Darth Vader . \nThe doctrine of `` force protection '' - making preservation of American lives the first mission priority - has made US forces unconvincing peacekeepers in Somalia and the Balkans , Vietnam and Lebanon . \nSo , too , has insensitivity about the interests of the people they are allegedly fighting to help . \nThere was a powerful scene in the TV film , in which a bored and jumpy soldier impulsively put a bullet into a dog . \nIts owner emerged from his house , bent over his pet 's corpse for a moment , then walked away , throwing up his hands in impotent misery . \nWhatever commanded that man 's loyalty six months ago , who can doubt which side he is on today . \n`` This is Indian territory ... If we meet the enemy , we shall overwhelm him with combat power , '' said the unit 's colonel , briefing his officers for an operation . \nAfter an emotional episode in which the whole regiment learned live on the radio about the death on patrol of one of its men , the colonel warned : `` I do n't want to hear anyone say anyone 's dead on the net , right ? '' \nThe key imperative for every counter-insurgency campaign is to engage sympathetically with the population . \n`` The only time most Iraqis converse with Americans is when a civil affairs officer comes to pay out compensation for killing somebody in the family , '' a reporter who has spent several months in Iraq observed recently . \nAmerican forces bring nothing in their wake that Iraqis can perceive as good or helpful , only a cacophony of military noise , spasmodic death and destruction . \nIn all this , of course , the resemblance to Vietnam is striking . \nUS commanders would say more emollient tactics are impossible in the face of an increasingly violent insurgency . \nThe suicide bombers , rocket firers and snipers oblige US units tooperate as they do . \nIf men went forth on foot , bare-headed , they would pay with their lives . \nThis may be true . \nYet the aim of all insurgencies is to provoke the ruling power to inflict such pain on the civilian population that it forfeits support . \nThis is what happened so spectacularly in Vietnam , and what also seems to be happening in Iraq . \nFor each of the 1,600 US soldiers killed since Bush declared `` significant combat operations '' at an end more than two years ago , some 20 Iraqis are estimated to have died . \nThe warrior culture and firepower of the US army make it almost irresistible in a conventional war , yet disastrously ill-orientated for the sort of the struggle it faces today . \nThe more domestic pressure Bush faces , the less inclined will be his commanders in the field to risk exposing their men in human contact with Iraqis . \nI wrote here a few weeks ago that it seemed premature to write off Iraq , even if the omens are grim . \nIt remains the case that , however disastrously misconceived was the original decision to invade , to quit precipitately promises anarchy . \nIn the US , disillusionment with the war has not - yet , anyway - developed into the sort of national rage that , during Vietnam , destroyed Lyndon Johnson . \nYet the rival timetables , of rising anti-war feeling at home and lack of progress on the ground are plainly working against the Bush administration . \nMost experts suggest it will take five years , if not more , before Iraqi security forces can conceivably take over from the coalition . \nWho can believe that US opinion will tolerate a commitment on the present scale , a continuing drain of American casualties , for that long ? \nSir Jeremy Greenstock , the former British senior representative in Iraq , thinks it somewhere between difficult and impossible to remedy US policy failures in the immediate aftermath of the war . \nHe is probably right . \nBush is still many months off being ready to quit and leave the country to resolve its own fate . \nBut this is coming to seem the likeliest outcome . \nThe most notable irony of a comparison between Indochina and Iraq is that American defeat in 1975 brought about Vietnamese unification , while American failure in Iraq will almost certainly precipitate that country 's fragmentation . \nMax Hastings 's book Warriors : Exceptional Tales from the Battlefield is available in hardback . \n"}

'' \nThe alliance members also discussed the broader future of Nato following reports that the French president , Jacques Chirac , had backed a controversial recent call by the German chancellor , Gerhard Schrder , to question whether Nato was still the ideal primary forum for transatlantic dialogue . \nMr Bush has rebuffed the idea of revamping Nato and said earlier today that the organization was `` a vital relationship to the United States and Europe '' . \nHowever , according to notes released by Mr Chirac 's aides , the French president told the summit : `` We must also , as the German chancellor has underlined , continue to take account of the changes that have occurred on the European continent ... Europe and the United States are real partners . \nSo we need to dialogue and listen to each other more . '' \nDuring the summit , Mr Bush won a long-sought Nato commitment for more training aid to build up Iraqi security . \nAnalysts said the contribution was modest but Mr Bush said `` every contribution helps '' . \nThe US military has estimated that 136,000 Iraqi military , police and national guardsmen have been trained and equipped , which is fewer than half the ultimate goal of a force of about 270,000 , a goal seen as pivotal in freeing up coalition forces to leave . \nDay two of Bush 's visit to Europe Earlier Mr Bush had breakfast with the prime minister , Tony Blair , who paid tribute to Mr Bush 's leadership in the Middle East , saying there was a real prospect of peace in the region . \nBoth leaders emphasised the importance of transatlantic ties . \nMr Blair said there was a chance for a stable , prosperous and democratic Iraq and a `` real solid basis now for going forward in a unified way '' . \nAt the beginning of his trip yesterday , Mr Bush made a speech in Brussels in which he appealed to Europe over the Middle East , climate change and the common values of the two continents . \nHe declared that the US stood `` proudly '' in the tradition of the Magna Carta and the Declaration of the Rights of Man . \nToday , Mr Blair praised the president 's speech , describing it as setting out a `` very clear way forward for us now , whatever the differences in the international community there have been over the last couple of years '' . \nLast night , Mr Bush dined with Mr Chirac , who opposed the war in Iraq . \nMr Chirac said US-French relations had been excellent for 200 years and the Iraq war had not changed that After traveling to Germany tomorrow , Mr Bush will visit Slovakia to meet the Russian president , Vladimir Putin , on Thursday . \nMr Bush had some critical words for the Russian leader yesterday , suggesting that he was backsliding on democracy . \n`` I 've got a good relationship with Vladimir . \nI intend to keep it that way , '' Mr Bush said . \n`` But , as well , I intend to remind him that if his interests lie west , that -LRB- the United States and its allies -RRB- share values , and those values are important .

' \n9\\/11 , ' as Spielberg has remarked , ` changed everything . ' \nOn the posters for his film , a rotating globe pauses to display the US , extended between its shining seas . \nBut nothing shines : red prehensile suckers that belong to some unseen , unclassifiable life-form grip Texas , while the Midwest is a scorching maelstrom . \nAs befits a summer blockbuster , the film piles up catastrophes , and its promised highlights include a crashing plane , a capsizing ferry , and the usual mobs of traumatised extras . \nThe last hope of mankind appears to be Tom Cruise in a leather jacket and tactically ripped jeans . \nIn 1898 , society prepared to confront a fin-de-sicle that seemed likely , as a witty nihilist puts it in a play by Oscar Wilde , to be the fin du monde . \nMan had recently killed off God ; having destroyed its creator , could our species expect to survive much longer ? \nAnticipating that terminus , HG Wells wrote an apocalyptic romance about it , The War of the Worlds . \nWe have been retelling his story ever since . \nIn Wells 's novel Martians on skeletal tripods descend to trample or gobble up earthlings who seem , to their superior intellects , mere noxious insects . \nOur frail blue planet is overrun by mechanised conquerors from a world which is red , bellicose , unmerciful . \nWells considered this outcome to be just and logical . \nEuropean empires , enslaving or exterminating new worlds elsewhere on our globe , had been equally remorseless . \nHis novel reminded Europeans that their tenure of power was insecure , and - quite apart from its critique of imperialism - pointed out that we live on an ailing planet in a moribund universe , doomed by the cooling of the sun . \nWells had no doubt about where the end of the world should take place . \nWhen he wrote , Britain was the global overlord . \nHis Martians therefore bump to earth in the Home Counties . \nThey advance into London and demolish it to clear a nursery for the red weed that sustains them , before expiring - brought low by measly bacteria , not by human force or divine intervention - in rancid heaps in Regent 's Park . \nThe book ends with the narrator looking down from Primrose Hill , delighted to see the chimneys of the reconstructed capital smoking again . \nHis contentment seems absurdly complacent now , and also sadly provincial . \nThe course of empire soon moved westward , so when Orson Welles performed a radio adaptation of Wells 's story in October 1938 , he inevitably altered the setting . \nNow the Martian rocket cylinder lands in New Jersey , and its stilted warriors stalk across the countryside towards New York . \nThey wade over the Hudson River , dwarfing the Manhattan skyline as they rise like a series of new , spiked towers ; they stride down the avenues of the current imperial capital , and terrorised multitudes hurl themselves into the East River ` like rats ' . \nWelles 's transmission breaks off as a reporter drops his microphone and collapses , asphyxiated by lethal fumes . \n` This is the end now , ' he gasps . \nWelles immediately explained that the broadcast had been a Halloween prank , with the Martians as those ridiculous revenants who are supposed to quit their graves on All Souls ' Night . \nBut by then , the damage was done ; listeners unaware of the practical joke had panicked , and by spreading the news provoked a communal nervous breakdown . \nWelles exposed the psychological vulnerability of his society , which was ready to believe in the certainty of its own extinction . \nWelles was made to feel like Judas , as he said next morning . \nEvery time The War of the Worlds is retold , God - the upholder of human supremacy , for we are supposed to be his pet species - is put to death again . \nThe myth made itself at home in 1938 , and demonstrated its credentials as a prophetic fiction . \nHoward Koch 's script found a contemporary relevance in the artilleryman Wells 's hero meets on Putney Hill . \nNewly encountered near the Holland Tunnel leading into Manhattan , he becomes a gloating fascist who rejoices in the assault on the city and on liberal illusions about progress and democracy ; barbarism , he predicts , will reinvigorate the world . \nBy 1952 , when Byron Haskin directed a film version , the war of the worlds seemed already to have happened . \nThe prophecy had fulfilled itself , so the film used newsreels of European cities flattened by bombs during the Second World War to document the Martian advance . \nAs if in retreat from the old , bankrupt , ruined continent , the action was moved further westwards . \nThe Martian craft now land in California , and the city they topple is Los Angeles . \nEarly in the Cold War , the story turned into a trial of competing technical and military might . \nHG Wells 's Martians cannibalise humans , but in 1952 they rely on radiating weapons that reduce men to gray piles of ash . \nA scientist in the Haskin film suggests that they belong to a superior culture . \nThat , for the Pentagon generals who manage reprisals , is reason enough to destroy them , and an atomic bomb is lobbed at their mother ship ; they repel it by raising an electronic umbrella . \nThe conflict turns into a holy war against what Reagan - whose geopolitical world-view was formed by such vacuous Hollywood products - would surely have called an ` evil empire ' . \nThe menaced citizens of Los Angeles hole up in their churches , and fervently pray for deliverance ; the comeuppance of the Martians is a consequence of atheistic hubris , when one of them smashes a stained glass window and instantly lunges out of the sky . \nIt 's still microbes that vanquish them , but the film 's narrator , piously altering Wells 's bleaker text , assumes that God created those germs for exactly this purpose . \nThe deity remains a loyal American . \nIt 's apt that Tom Cruise - aware that he had signed up for a crusade - insisted on installing a Scientology tent on Spielberg 's set , so he could proselytise for his cult between takes . \nWells 's story satirised the lazy rapacity of men by exposing them to a race of even more implacable predators . \nIn successive retellings , it grew blunter and began to pander to the very complacency it first condemned . \nJeff Wayne 's rock opera The War of the Worlds - recorded in 1978 with Richard Burton narrating and David Essex among the singers - cosily redeems the Hitlerian artilleryman who fantasises about revenge in the Welles broadcast . \nNow , as he huddles in the sewers , he sings a rousing anthem about the ` brave new world ' men will build below ground , with railway tunnels to the coast so they can have holidays at the beach . \nPoverty , he casually promises , will be abolished . \nNot even the Martians can resist the optimism of music . \nWayne 's adaptation did have a serious point , and a computer game developed from it interprets The War of the Worlds as an allegory about the fight to sequester our planet 's diminishing resources . \nIf you play on the home team , you battle to conserve supplies of steel , coal and oil ; the Martians want copper and human blood , their favorite tipple . \nStill , to reduce this eschatological war to a game implies a jaunty incomprehension of its meaning . \nInterestingly , Haskin 's 1952 film mocked such frivolous profiteering : the hicks in whose town the Martians land plan to open their own amusement park , with enchiladas for sale at the site . \n` We 've got a goldmine in our backyard , ' they gloat just before they are atomised . \nDuring the 1980s Spielberg planned to transform The War of the Worlds into a roller-coaster ride for the Universal Studios theme parks in Los Angeles and Orlando . \nAt that stage he too thought of it as a ludic fantasy ; now , after 9\\/11 , he sees it as a baleful premonition of the end . \nIn 1996 Tim Burton 's Mars Attacks ! \nThe film was based on a set of bubble-gum cards in which Martians with heads full of green guano make miscegenated love to nubile female earthlings . \nIts farcical mayhem strays far from the story told by Wells , yet it is closer than any other adaptation to the pessimistic spirit of the original book , because it refuses to assume that the human race has any automatic right to prevail . \nJust who , in this film , are the monsters ? \nNot , surely , the extra-terrestrials ; I 'd sooner vote for Danny DeVito as a gambling midget , Rod Steiger as a demented general , Jack Nicholson as the vain , dumb , useless American President , or Tom Jones as himself . \nFor once , the rampages of the invaders are not to be regretted . \nAnnette Bening , as a blissed-out hippy , says that the human race does n't deserve to live , and Sylvia Sidney , playing a dotty tribal elder , whoops with hilarity at the latest atrocity : ` They blew up Congress ! \nWhen Sarah Jessica Parker , an air-brained chat-show hostess , says that the Martians look gross , the professorial Pierce Brosnan sucks on his pipe and reminds her that we probably look just as repellent to them . \nThe invaders in his film are immune to the usual microbes , but have a fatal allergy to the country and western yodellings of Slim Whitman . \nIf civilisation is saved by the ululations of a forgotten folk singer , is it worth saving at all ? \nFor Spielberg 's screenwriter David Koepp , the story trips up that triumphal civilisation . \nHis Martians , he claims , are merely conducting the belligerent foreign policy of the US , even though this time they happen to be stomping into New York . \nWhat stops the armored , insensitive global power is ' a local insurgency ' ; the film , he says , is his commentary on the Iraq war . \nWe may at last be getting back to what Wells had in mind a century ago . \nThe War of the Worlds is not about a combat with aliens : actually it dramatises the self-destructiveness of our own small , over-heated , apopleptic planet . \nWe delude ourselves if we expect our world to have a happy ending . \nWar of the Worlds is released on 1 July Letters for publication should be sent to : letters@observer.co.uk If you need help using the site : userhelp@guardian.co.uk Call the main Guardian and Observer switchboard : 11.36 BST on Sunday 12 June 2005 . \n"}
{"id": "146", "time": "2005-06-12", "text": "Colin Smith offers a magisterial account of the British retreat along the Malay peninsula in Singapore Burning , says Neal Ascherson The Australians at Singapore broke and ran . \nAnyone old enough to remember hearing that story must have wondered if it was n't just another of those sour wartime myths , brewed in British hearts to compensate for losing an empire and getting bread rationing . \nThis tremendous book shows that it was . \nGeneral Gordon Bennett 's infantry gave way and fled by the thousand as the Japanese stormed ashore . \nBut seen across 60 years and by the standards of today , running away made sense . \nWar is a mad island , on which reasonable behavior is reversed . \nPeople ` put themselves in harm 's way ' , as opponents of the Iraq war touchingly put it , instead of moving out of danger . \nThey are required to disconnect instinct and stay in position as a mortar barrage approaches . \nThey must try to kill other people who , if left unchallenged , might not try to kill them back . \nThree states of mind can help soldiers achieve this reversal . \nOne is blind obedience , becoming an institutionalised patient in the madhouse . \nThe second is believing that the safety of the family or community you love is genuinely at stake . \nThe third is to have an at least credible expectation of winning this war . \nThe Australians at Singapore had none of these . \nAs free men , they found it hard to risk their necks on the orders of officers they considered dangerous idiots . \nAs citizens , they would have been happy to biff Jerries in defense of poor old England , but what were they doing defending the privileges of stuck-up Poms in this Asian colony ? \nAs soon as they got into action on the Malay peninsula , it became obvious the Japanese were going to win . \nChurchill sent telegrams about fighting to the bitter end and dying in the ruins of Singapore to save the honor of the race . \nThousands of Australians , who were to fight fiercely and expertly in later campaigns , did n't see the point of that and headed for the docks . \nReading Smith 's account , you see their logic . \nHow could the British and Australians have hoped to win with the resources they had ? \nThe Japanese assault force was numerically smaller than the defense , but mostly composed of highly trained and battle-hardened troops . \nMalaya was defended by a strange assortment of British regulars , inexperienced Australians and Indian army divisions whose men were often half-trained teenagers . \nThe Japanese brought tanks and a large tactical airforce . \nThe British had no tanks and , worse , very few anti-tank weapons . \nTheir airforce , mainly composed of slow and obsolete machines without modern fighters until the last few days , lost half its strength in the first 24 hours after the Japanese landed in northern Malaya on 8 December 1941 . \nWhen bombs and torpedoes sank the battlecruiser Repulse and the battleship Prince of Wales two days later , Japan achieved naval as well as air supremacy . \nIt 's true that the defenders were plagued by terrible mistakes and bad luck . \nThese nourish fantasies that the outcome could have been different . \nIf the British had entered southern Thailand , instead of dithering until it was too late , could n't they have slaughtered the invaders on the beaches ? \nIf Admiral Phillips had set off earlier to attack the invasion fleet , or turned back as soon as he knew his warships had been spotted , could n't the Japanese troopships have been scattered ? \nIf the ship with more anti-tank guns had n't been sunk ; if the RAF had possessed Hurricanes at the start instead of the old Brewster Buffalos ; if the Australian artillery had received the signals that the Japanese assault landing on Singapore island had begun ... But none of these possibilities was the case . \nEven if they had been , Smith 's book suggests that the attack would have still prevailed . \nThe defenders , often heroically brave , were simply not up to it . \nSymptomatic is their shocking failure to communicate . \nThe radios did not work , the field-telephone cables broke , the signals routines were chaotic . \nWhen the first landings began at Kota Baharu , all communications with Singapore jammed so that it was 90 minutes before local aircraft were ordered to bomb the beaches . \nIt was also true that the Japanese were better soldiers . \nSmith points out that they were neither suicidal fanatics nor trained jungle fighters . \nTheir personal weapons were slightly inferior . \n` What -LRB- they -RRB- had in abundance was courage , endurance and a discipline that , in their eagerness to see that orders were carried out , did not stifle initiative but encouraged it . ' \nMost of this book is an account , from hundreds of sources on both sides , of the long British retreat down the Malay peninsula , punctuated by desperate battles . \nColin Smith knows how it feels to be a soldier , and his story - the experiences of named men and units as they fought , retreated with terrible wounds or died - is unforgettably well told . \nSo is his history of the aftermath : the fall of the great city , the bayoneting of the hospital wounded , the murder of the Australian nurses , the massacre of the Chinese population . \nThe British commander , General Percival , lost 7,500 dead in the 10-week campaign . \nThen he went with his men into captivity , where more than 12,000 died . \nGeneral Gordon Bennett bolted and got a boat to Sumatra . \nHistory should be rougher with him than with his soldiers . \nThey asked themselves what they were dying for and found no convincing answer . \nThe defense of Malaya and Singapore was a war which could not be won , but which had to be fought . \nBecause nobody knew an alternative . \nWrite your review of this or any other book , find out what other readers thought or add it to your lists Letters for publication should be sent to : letters@observer.co.uk If you need help using the site : userhelp@guardian.co.uk Call the main Guardian and Observer switchboard : 00.50 BST on Sunday 12 June 2005 Find books to review , discuss , buy Search all -LRB- title , author or ISBN -RRB- Latest news and views from the Guardian 's books team paullaity : Read this : clever and funny and rightly cutting . \n"}
{"id": "76", "time": "2005-11-05", "text": "A political war that backfired In advance of publication of his memoirs , Britain 's former ambassador to the US reveals why he supported the war in Iraq but is far from happy about the aftermath Sir Christopher Meyer , former British ambassador to the USA . \nPhotograph : Dan Chung\\/Guardian A small , hand-addressed blue box on Sir Christopher Meyer 's desk provides a clue to his background . \nIt contains a miniature stone replica of the White House and was a gift this month from Karl Rove , President Bush 's political adviser . \nIt a sign that Sir Christopher is not just another former ambassador but a man close to the heart of Republican America . \nAs British ambassador to Washington from 1997 to February 2003 , he was the man who introduced a wary Tony Blair to Mr Bush . \nHe led the way towards the unexpected mating of New Labor with the American right , a relationship that eventually took Britain to war in Iraq . \nHe did not just arrange meetings between the two leaders but spoke up at them . \nHe was a confidant of both sides , with regular private meetings with everyone in the White House from vice-president Dick Cheney and his aide Lewis `` Scooter '' Libby , now being prosecuted in Washington , to the president himself . \nHe reinvented what it meant to be Britain 's ambassador to Washington , a dominant figure in the capital 's social life as well as in politics . \nHis posting overlapped the Clinton and Bush administrations and , with access to both the US and British sides , he was well placed to track the debate in the run-up to the Iraq invasion . \nHe supported the war but is far from happy about the handling of the aftermath . \n`` I do n't believe the enterprise is doomed necessarily , though , God , it does not look good , '' he says in an interview with the Guardian marking the publication of his memoirs , DC Confidential . \n`` A lot of people think what we are going to end up with is precisely what we did n't want . '' \nIt is not a book that will make comfortable reading for Mr Blair and those who served him . \nHe is the first of the insiders involved in the planning of the war to publish a first-hand account . \nHe is not flattering about the way the prime minister , his ministers and advisers went about their task . \nNow as chairman of the Press Complaints Commission , Britain 's newspaper watchdog , he works from a small , shabby office just off Fleet Street , a far cry from the embassy receptions and official Rolls-Royce that once ferried him around the US capital . \nHe looks at the breakdown of Iraq now with the detachment of an outsider - but one with a unique insight into how the war came about and what could have been done differently . \nHe contrasts Mr Blair 's meek approach with Lady Thatcher 's dealings with the White House . \nMr Blair behaved very differently from what Sir Christopher calls `` the Thatcher style '' . \nHe saw it first-hand on many of her trips abroad . \n`` Thatcher had no hesitation on the phone , or surging into the Oval office to blaze away if she thought Reagan was doing something stupid . \nAnd she did on a number of occasions and sometimes it was extremely effective and certainly did not damage the relationship at all . \nI think Tony Blair and Downing Street were reluctant to perform in that way , '' he says . \nAnd for all his rhetorical strengths , Mr Blair was surprisingly weak on detail . \nHe faced a president who was sharper than Europeans generally assume . \nThere were `` moments of great power and strength exerted by Blair , usually in the rhetorical framing of issues . \nBut we see , how can I put it , less attention to detail than some of these issues demanded . '' \nLady Thatcher took pride in knowing more detail than her officials . \n`` That is why it was terrifying to be summoned into her presence because if you did not know your stuff , she would expose you . \nThere was never that danger with Tony Blair . '' \nSir Christopher , who had access not only to all the Bush-Blair phone exchanges but position papers written by Mr Blair , was in a position to know . \n`` Tony Blair was not in that mould , '' he says comparing him with Lady Thatcher . \n`` I do n't mean he was idle or lazy , but he was impatient . \nHe liked the vision thing , whether it was about Kosovo , Putin 's Russia or Saddam Hussein . \nBut he was n't interested in the ballast behind the ideas . \nHe reminded me of a continental European politician . \nKohl or Mitterrand . '' \nBut Sir Christopher adds : `` He never made a fool of himself . '' \nNor did Gordon Brown , who crossed the Washington ambassador 's path on his frequent visits to the US . \n`` On attention to detail , he was the polar opposite of Blair , '' he says . \n`` I have rarely come across two political people that are so different . '' \nHe recounts the tale of a trip to New York he took with the chancellor . \nHe feared that Mr Brown be a `` dour lump of granite '' but instead found him chatty , energetic and furiously well informed . \n`` Whammo , off we went talking about American politics , all kind of things , and he was scribbling his speech . \nI was impressed by it , '' says Sir Christopher . \nNone the less , his descriptions of ministers and officials will be acutely embarrassing to some of those involved in planning the Iraq war - a fact that led him to fear the Cabinet Office might try to block his book . \nAlready this year the memoirs of Sir Jeremy Greenstock , Britain 's former UN ambassador who later served in Iraq , have been withheld from publication on the orders of the Foreign Office . \nSir Christopher says that Jack Straw , the foreign secretary , blocked the book personally and that it will not be published `` until another foreign secretary occupies that chair '' . \n`` Deep throats inside the Foreign Office tell me so , '' he adds . \nSo what , two-and-a-half years after the invasion , do the president and prime minister have to do now ? \n`` I think the US and ourselves are on the horns of an absolutely impossible dilemma , '' he says . \nHe opposes an early pullout of US and British troops . \nAbandoning the task of rebuilding the country would leave `` the relatives of at least 2,000 American servicemen and 98 British servicemen with a legitimate question about what they died for '' . \nBut he accepts that the task of rebuilding may now be impossible . \n`` There is no doubt that the presence of American and British troops to a degree motivates the insurgency . \nSo this is agonising for Bush and I think it is agonising for Blair , all of us really . '' \nHe also dismisses the prime minister 's claim that the war has not exposed Britain to terrorist attacks . \n`` There is plenty of evidence around at the moment that home-grown terrorism was partly radicalised and fuelled by what is going on in Iraq , '' he says . \n`` There is no way we can credibly get up and say it has nothing to do with it . \nDo n't tell me that being in Iraq has got nothing to do with it . \nOf course , it does . \nThe issue is it is part of the price we have to pay and should be paying for the removal of Saddam Hussein and at the moment the jury is out . '' \nHe never expected to have such doubts at this stage . \n`` I was a war supporter . \nI still think it was the right thing to do to bring Saddam to heel . '' \nWriting the book , a process he began on a family holiday in France last year , as well as the worsening situation in Iraq , has led him to think hard about what should have been done differently . \nIn Washington , he says , ahead of the war , `` there was a massive amount of wishful thinking which led to really not working through in detail and assiduously what would need to be done after Saddam was driven from power . \nThey were being told by people that they would be greeted as heroes and liberators . '' \nThe reality , of course , turned out to be different and Sir Christopher 's view is that this should have been predicted . \nWith hindsight , of course , there were no weapons of mass destruction , one of the prime justifications for the war , at least in Britain . \n`` This is one of history 's loose ends , which may yet be tied , '' he suggests defensively . \nBut he denies that the government suspected all along that Saddam was less of a threat than was being claimed in public . \n`` I do not know anyone of any stature in 2002 who was going around saying they do n't have this stuff . '' \nThe US Iraq survey team , sent in after the war , failed to find any WMD after one of the most intensive hunts in history . \nSir Christopher suggests they could have been `` spirited out of the country into Syria or maybe even Iran . \nThat is a possibility '' . \nTo the Americans , though , Sir Christopher says , the war was always about regime change , not WMD . \n`` One of the things that came to me when writing was how political the war was . \nThis was n't just a war , it was a political war . '' \nThe US , he says , wanted to `` replace a bad government with a good government '' . \nIt was , he says , the `` neo-con vision '' . \nUS officials who planned the war , such as deputy defense secretary Paul Wolfowitz , `` thought it was possible to bring not perfect democracy but start with a fairly rough and ready version that would be the basis from which you could move on to higher things '' . \n`` Put it like that and it does n't sound so loony , '' he says . \nAnd despite the current situation in Iraq , Sir Christopher remains an admirer of Mr Bush . \n`` I have got to declare an interest : I like George W Bush . \nIn public , on the whole , he does n't do himself justice , at least for a European audience . \nIn private , from the very first time I met him , I found him articulate and interesting . \nHe did do detail . \nYou can argue , millions will , that what he did with those details and the policies he created out of them are not to our liking . \nBut the portrait of an ideological , religious simpleton is wildly off-beam . '' \nEven now , with polls showing support for the war falling in the US , his mishandling of the Hurricane Katrina aftermath , the indictment of `` Scooter '' Libby and the question marks over Mr Rove , Sir Christopher 's view is unchanged . \nHe says he did not start writing for the money and will donate fees from newspaper serialisation to three children 's charities . \nWith his tenure at the PCC extended for another three years , accepting the money was not an option . \nSir Christopher 's book focuses on his time in Washington but covers a career that included stints as John Major 's press secretary . \nHe watched Alastair Campbell , a fellow insider in the run-up to war , go about his job with the critical eye of a predecessor . \n`` Alastair had never been a civil servant and the prime minister he was serving belonged to a party that had been in opposition for almost 20 years . '' \nAt times , Mr Campbell overlooked `` the constitutional propriety , the dividing line between what a civil servant should do and a political appointee should do '' . \nAs a Downing Street insider , Sir Christopher experienced first-hand some of the darkest days of Mr Major 's prime ministership . \nSo what does he think about Mr Blair 's troubles in a week that saw the prime minister lose a cabinet minister and almost lose a key parliamentary vote ? \n`` It reminds me so much of those days , '' he says . \n`` Somewhere along the line , you reach the point of no return ... I would n't be surprised if this was it . '' \nFrom an old ally of Mr Blair 's , that is a damning comment . \nHe writes about his time running the Washington embassy which - full of guests , ranging from former prime ministers to members of the royal family and rock stars - resembled a `` hotel of eccentrics '' . \nHis relationship with Downing Street deteriorated in that tense year before the war . \nHe left the job just before war broke out , even though Mr Blair wanted him to remain for a few more months to ensure an orderly handover . \nWhen he got back to London , he was not granted the traditional formal farewell interview with the prime minister . \nBy contrast , the president and his wife hosted a private dinner party in the White House . \n`` Never put your trust in princes , '' he says . \nDC Confidential by Christopher Meyer is published by Weidenfeld & Nicolson . \nTo order a copy go to Guardian . \nco. uk\\/bookshop or call 08708360875 . \n"}
{"id": "140", "time": "2005-12-14", "text": "Wednesday 14 December 2005 18.17 GMT The US president , George Bush , today admitted much of the intelligence used as the basis for invading Iraq had been `` wrong '' - but defended his decision to go to war because it removed Saddam Hussein . \nIn a speech at the Woodrow Wilson Centre , in Washington , Mr Bush also pledged that US troops would remain in Iraq until `` victory is achieved '' . \nThe speech was the fourth and last in a series aimed at bolstering flagging support for the Iraqi conflict . \n`` It is true that much of the intelligence turned out to be wrong , '' Mr Bush said . \n`` As president , I am responsible for the decision to go into Iraq . '' \nHowever , he added : `` My decision to remove Saddam Hussein was the right decision . \nSaddam was a threat , and the American people and the world is better off because he is no longer in power . '' \nThe intelligence Mr Bush could have been referring to may be the pre-war information gathered from Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi , a Libyan , who claimed al-Qaida was linked to Iraq . \nMr Libi later said he made his most specific claims whilst in Egyptian custody in a bid to avoid `` harsh treatment '' . \nIn a CIA report published in the New York Times last week , unnamed officials admitted that Mr Libi been subjected to rendition when he told his interrogators that Iraq had trained al-Qaida operatives . \nBefore the Iraq war , the Bush administration frequently cited Mr Libi 's information as `` credible evidence '' . \nOn the eve of Iraq 's first parliamentary elections , the US president pledged to solve the previous problems with his administration 's intelligence capabilities . \nHe was adamant that US troops would remain in Iraq until a `` free and democratic '' country was in place . \n`` We can not and will not leave Iraq until victory is achieved , '' he said . \nMr Bush reiterated his hopes that an Iraq with a functioning democracy and thriving economy would be a model for other nations in the Middle East . \nIn the Senate , 40 Democrats and one independent signed a letter to Mr Bush in which they urged him to be more open with the Iraqi and US public . \nThe letter urged the administration to `` tell the leaders of all groups and political parties in Iraq that they need to make the compromises necessary to achieve the broad-based and sustainable political settlement that is essential for defeating the insurgency in Iraq within the schedule they set for themselves '' . \nIt adds that Mr Bush must also present `` a plan that identifies the remaining political , economic , and military benchmarks that must be met and a reasonable schedule to achieve them '' . \nThe president responded by outlining what constituted victory in Iraq and when US troops could begin returning home . \n`` Victory will be achieved by meeting certain objectives : when the terrorists and Saddamists can no longer threaten Iraq 's democracy , when the Iraqi security forces can protect their own people , and when Iraq is not a safe haven for terrorists to plot attacks against our country , '' he said . \n`` These objectives , not timetables set by politicians in Washington , will drive our force levels in Iraq .

'' Suddenly , the usual apologetics wo n't work . \nNo one can say Iran 's president was really complaining about Israel or Zionism , rather than Jews . \nNo one can say he was talking about the west 's colonial crimes . \nHe was peddling , instead , one of the defining tropes of the racist hard right : Holocaust denial . \nIt is a stance that seeks to deny Jews their history , their suffering , almost their very being . \nLike denying that African-Americans were ever slaves , it is a move made by those who wish only harm . \nIn this light , Ahmadinejad 's previous musings look rather different . \nWhen , in October , he stood beneath a banner that promised `` A world without Zionism '' and called for Israel to be `` wiped off the map '' , many Jews felt a chill at what seemed an annihilationist fantasy . \nCooler heads said no , this was merely the hyperbolic style of the region , deployed to press a robust anti-Zionist rather than anti-semitic case . \nWhat he wanted , they explained patiently , was a world without Zionism , not a world without Jews . \nWell , now I 'm done with the charitable explanations . \nA man who refuses to believe the historic truth is capable of anything . \nThis is not an Arabic cable TV station or an obscure Egyptian newspaper . \nThis is a head of government , the leader of a nation of 70 million - a country that aspires to lead the Muslim world . \nAnd , lest we forget , Iran has nuclear ambitions . \nSo now it 's not paranoid to worry about a president with annihilationist dreams - it 's smart . \nUnfortunately , it does n't end with Ahmadinejad , a man with no experience outside Iran , a hick who , Iranian analyst Dr Ali Ansari concedes , is a `` monumental embarrassment '' . \nFor he has given voice to a sentiment that runs deep in Iran and in the wider Muslim world . \nJust look at this week 's Iranian press . \n`` Many revisionist historians believe the story of the Holocaust is fake and have proved it by much evidence and documents , '' says the conservative paper Resalat . \nHardline Siyasat-e Ruz applauds the leader for `` revealing the truth '' . \nIt 's hardly a surprise . \nTV stations across the Muslim world have been running this garbage for ages , along with lurid anti-semitism . \nJordanian TV 's Ramadan special this year was Al-Shatat , a Syrian-produced series that speaks of a `` global Jewish government '' and depicts the ancient blood libel : the accusation that Jews use the blood of Christian children in preparing food for Passover . \nThat was a follow-up to Egyptian television 's Ramadan treat in 2002 : Horseman without a Horse , whose central theme was the Protocols of the Elders of Zion , the century-old forgery concocted by the Tsarist secret police which alleged a Jewish plot to take over the world . \nWe can deny it no longer : the virus of anti-semitism has infected the Muslim world . \nAnd virus it is , for Jew-hatred on this scale , as Christian Europe can testify , is a kind of sickness . \nThis is one of the grossest legacies bequeathed by the west : that Muslims have taken to heart a form of anti-semitism alien to their own lands , borrowing a language and iconography that was made in Christendom . \nBlood libels and the Protocols were dreamed up in Norwich , Mainz or Moscow - yet now they breathe anew in Cairo , Riyadh and Damascus . \nThis represents a menace to Jews , of course , but also a tragedy for Muslims . \nTheirs is a tradition that historically valued learning , and when an ignoramus like Ahmadinejad denies the overwhelming weight of historical evidence he makes a mockery of that tradition . \nIn a period Jews still look back on as a golden age , Muslims were the people of scholarship , of science , of tolerance and coexistence - a contrast with the Crusader barbarians . \nYet now many lap up the myths and lies that were once fed to the peasants of Europe , lies which endured through to the last century - and which led all the way to Treblinka . \nToday 's Muslims should want no part of such ignorance or bigotry . \nSo Azzam Tamimi of the Muslim Association of Britain is to be applauded for his implicit condemnation of Ahmadinejad at the Stop the War conference at the weekend , telling his audience that , whatever their views , they could not deny the fact of the Holocaust . \nNow the Muslim Council of Britain should follow his lead , and that of the Muslim Public Affairs Council in the US , which also condemned this preacher of hate . \nAnd those non-Muslim progressives who have made alliances with Islamists should do the same . \nIt may mean some uncomfortable conversations - but the days of denial must end . \n"}

'' \nLt Gen Carl Strock , commander of the Army Corps of Engineers , which is responsible for the city 's flood defences , said that one of the two major breaches in the levee system had been plugged and the other should be fixed later today . \n`` Once we seal those two places , that should stop the water from going in , '' he said . \n`` Our real focus right now is getting the flow stopped so we can get in and drain the city . '' \nTelephone company BellSouth Corp estimated it would cost $ 400-600m and take up to six months to repair the damage in the hardest-hit areas of New Orleans and the Gulf coast of Mississippi . \nPutting the electricity back on presents one of the greatest headaches . \nEntergy , the New Orleans utility company , yesterday said technicians still could not get near equipment to determine its status . \nIt said its underground system was designed to survive submerging but , above ground , equipment such as electronic controls and transformers had been damaged . \nEvery building would have to be checked before the electricity was brought back on , said a spokesman . \nExperts said some buildings may be so heavily contaminated with sewage and toxic chemicals that it may be necessary to rebuild much of the city . \n`` The toxic soup is touching every square inch of the flooded areas , '' said Paul Farmer , director of the American Planning Association . \n`` The environmental clean-up is one that we have not typically faced with other disasters . \n`` It 's not just the structural integrity of the buildings , but it 's the whole issue of contamination : contamination of buildings , contamination of yards , '' he said . \nThere are 22 large-scale pumps used by city engineers to keep the streets of the low-lying city dry when it rains . \nThey could be used in the operation once enough water has been removed and their electrics replaced . \nConcrete and steel offices should survive relatively unscathed , though smaller-scale buildings , such as houses , may have to be rebuilt . \nThe sodden ground makes them liable to subsidence , and submerged plaster , mortar and timber will need to be replaced . \n"}

' \nI followed love to Cornwall , ' she says softly , a smile sneaking across her face . \n` In 1997 , my husband had just proposed and we could n't agree on north or south London . \nI said , what about America ? \nHe said , `` Bite your tongue ! '' \nHe used to go to Cornwall as a boy , I 'd traveled around with friends ... so , for love , I said OK . ' \nMark Hawley , the recording engineer who became Tori 's husband , found an old cottage near Bude . \nThe couple stripped and modernized it , draping fairy lights everywhere for a warm glow . \nIt is surprisingly modest -- not because Tori is ostentatious but because rock stars tend to be show-offs . ' \nI like cosy , intimate houses , ' she says , shrugging . \n` And Mark really picked it for the barn , which is now a recording studio . \nPeople say they feel really welcome when they come here and that 's all we hoped for . ' \nIt is certainly a sociable house . \nEach day more than half a dozen people turn up for lunch , most of whom are working in their studio , Martian Engineering . \nNot that 41-year-old Tori ever cooks ; she laughs at the idea . \n` Are you kidding ? ' \nFor the past six years , most of the food Tori has eaten has been made by Duncan Pickford , a chef who worked with Boyzone and Robbie Williams before moving to Cornwall to work exclusively in the Amos-Hawley household . \nDuncan explains that he knew how to feed Tori pretty much as soon as they met . \n` We developed a low-carb , low-fat regime with a lot of very clean protein , a lot of fish -- but she 's allowed to cheat , too . \nKnowing her as I do , I can almost tell at a glance what sort of space she 's in and what she needs , ' he says , laughing . \n` She eats more comfort food in the studio because she knows she has time to work a few pounds off , but on the road it 's all about stamina . ' \nIt can be quite tough finding quality produce in the south west so he 's got an organic vegetable field down the road and , of course , the local fresh fish is sublime . \nThe lobster he serves for lunch is simple but succulent -- cooked with garlic , olive oil , butter and oregano -- and a perfect antidote to the luxurious lentil and chicken soup starter . \nAnother favorite of fried catfish with tomato relish -- ` yum yum , ' says Tori -- is often accompanied by a fine bottle of wine in the evening . \n` We take a wine cellar on the road , ' she explains , ` but we never indulge till after the show . \nI only drink good wine ; if not , I 'd rather drink water . ' \nTori clearly trusts Duncan and sees him more as a friend than an employee . \nHe eats with her if he can and looked after her during her pregnancy -- no simple matter given that she had suffered a series of miscarriages and thought she was destined not to be a mother . \n` It was difficult , ' she says . ' \nI became a mom at 37 and having a child has been an emancipation for me . \nTash is four now and makes me feel young . ' \nTori smiles ; she seems calm when she talks about her daughter . \n` When I leave home to go on tour , she 's started saying : `` Tell Tori Amos not to take my mommy away . '' \nI have to respond : `` Tori Amos buys the dollies , be nice to her . \nShe does n't mean to take mommy away . '' \nYeah , she does listen to my music : she likes ` Ribbons Undone ' , her own song on my new album , and ` The Power of Orange Knickers ' , which Damien Rice sings on , too . ' \nThe Beekeeper is Tori 's ninth album and , with 19 songs , it 's a bit of a concept album . \nThere 's a religious theme , with Tori going back to her upbringing as the daughter of a Methodist minister in North Carolina for inspiration , but it sounds more like a wild Kate Bush than an evangelising eccentric . \nTori has always been a rebel of sorts -- she was expelled from Baltimore 's prestigious Peabody Conservatory at 11 and the press often have n't known how to deal with her . \nAs Bjrk is always an Icelandic elf , so Tori Amos is always kooky , and her playfulness can be hard to read . \nOn the cover of her 1996 album Boys For Pele , she was photographed suckling a piglet . \n` If I were a journalist , there were 70 ways of looking at it , but I do n't think kooky is one of them . ' \nTori is not sure , however , that she really cares what anyone thinks any more . \nHaving a child has taught her to be less obsessive about work and recent experience has made her focus on the positive . \nBut nothing will stop her from revealing the sort of things other rock stars do n't mention . \nTowards the end of our conversation , we go back to food and to Tori 's favorite London restaurants -- E&O , Tamarind and Le Caprice . ' \nI went to Le Caprice the night before I got married with some of my closest friends , including two who are no longer . \nMy brother died in a car crash in November . \nIt was a shock . ' \n` And Kevin Aucoin , the make-up artist , died a couple of years ago . \nWhenever I go to Le Caprice , it 's for the food for sure , but it 's also because I can look across the room and see those two wonderful men smiling and laughing that night without knowing ... what was to come . ' \nShe pauses again , then smiles , a smile as hopeful and bright as her hair . \n` It has made me value my family life . \nIt is to be enjoyed .

' \nDated 7 March and bearing the name of Blackwater 's president , Gary Jackson , the electronic newsletter adds that terrorists ` need to get creamed , and it 's fun , meaning satisfying , to do the shooting of such folk . ' \nHuman rights groups said yesterday that the comments raised fresh questions over the role of civilian contractors operating in Iraq and other world flashpoints . \n` We are very concerned about the increased use of security companies , there needs to be more inspection and regulation of these companies , ' said a spokesman for Amnesty International . \nBlackwater has already been the subject of lobbying efforts to introduce tighter regulations on private military operations in Iraq . \nIt is one of the fastest growing private security firms in the world , and achieved global prominence last year when four of its men were ambushed by a crowd of Iraqis and their bodies mutilated and dragged around the Iraqi city of Falluja . \nThe controversial wording of the Blackwater bulletin appears to be an attempt to criticise the ` righteous outcry ' that followed a recent statement from a senior US Marine general who , on returning home from Iraq , claimed it was ` fun to shoot some people ' . \nWhile the views of Lieutenant-General James Mattis drew a frosty response from the Pentagon , others said his observations reflected the harsh realities of war . \nBlackwater 's entry to the debate appears to suggest that satisfaction can be drawn from combat if ` the bad guys ' get what they deserve . \n` All of us who have ever waited through an hour and a half movie , or read some 300 pages of a thriller , to the point when the bad guys finally get their comeuppance know this perfectly well , ' says the opening address of the six-page bulletin , which The Observer believes to be authentic . \nCalled Blackwater Tactical Weekly , the newsletter was sent to environmental activist Frank Hewetson as well as the firm 's staff . \nLast year Hewetson was offered a job by Blackwater with a salary of up to # 85,000 plus health benefits to work with its ` military crisis operations support team . ' \nAlthough he declined , Hewetson remains on the firm 's database . \nThe 7 March bulletin also features a plug for Blackwater 's training academy which offers potential recruits an eight-week course that includes training in various firearms , close quarter protection , physical security as well as ` ground fighting . ' \nAmong its various roles in post-war Iraq , Blackwater has guarded provincial outposts for the Iraqi coalition provisional authority and had the contract to keep former chief US envoy Paul Bremer alive . \nThe company has been praised for its role in the rescue of a wounded soldier in Najaf . \nDefense experts have described Blackwater as a major player in the field of private arms with an important role to play in aiding American security in the war on terror . \nOther Blackwater emails seen by The Observer , from last year , indicate the large market for civilian contractors in war zones . \n` We will probably require at least 3000-4000 professionals above and beyond what we have in the Blackwater employment and resource system , ' states one . \nThere are thought to be as many as 20,000 private enterprise soldiers in Iraq , with the US military an advocate of their use . \nThis system allows governments to save money on paying permanent soldiers , and offers the political bonus that it is unlikely to attract as much media attention as conventional troops . \nThe Observer made numerous attempts to contact Blackwater 's head office in North Carolina , but no calls were returned . \nThere is , however , no evidence that company staff have ever shot people for fun . \nThe firm is understood to have disciplined and well-trained recruits . \nA number are thought to be elite soldiers who have retired from military special-operations units . \nBlackwater also offers extensive psychological counselling programs to combat potentially traumatic battlefield stress . \n"}

chaos , totalitarian mass politics , ideology , racial hatred , violence - were in full cry . \nAs a schoolboy , Wojtyla was largely oblivious to the tensions around him . \nIn 1938 , he and his father moved to Krakow where he studied literature and philosophy . \nIt was a time of cultural ferment as modernist art broadened from merely being the preserve of the avant garde and Wojtyla joined an experimental theater group . \nBut no young Pole could remain oblivious to outside events . \nOver the next six years , Poland would suffer more than most nations from the mass ideologies gripping millions in Europe . \nWojtyla escaped deportation and imprisonment by the German invaders by taking a job as a stone cutter in a quarry . \nIn late 1942 , he began studying at an underground seminary in Krakow . \nAround him all was chaos . \nWhen the Germans began rounding up Polish men , Wojtyla fled to the archbishop of Krakow 's residence , where he remained until the end of the war . \nThe future Pope was ordained in 1946 and the experience of war would mark him deeply . \nBoth fascism and communism seemed products of the modern industrialised world , a world stripped of tradition , faith and the mystery of the church . \nPost-war , the Iron Curtain descended on Europe . \nTo Wojtyla neither American-style capitalism nor communism could answer to the existential questions posed by the events of the previous decade . \nOnly religion could preserve the world from a repeat of the nightmare of the Forties . \nThe questions were about strategy , not conviction . \nIn 1962 , the year Vatican Council II began the debates that would spark widespread reform of the church , Wojtyla was named Bishop of Krakow . \nHe was an enthusiast for the changes , made an important intellectual contribution to the debate and , with his firsthand experience of repression in his native land , took special interest in religious freedom . \nThe task he would pursue throughout his life , reconciling modernity with tradition , preserving the core message of the church without letting it become out of touch in a new , increasingly globalised world was taking shape . \nHis appointment as cardinal in 1967 was welcomed by the communist Polish government who saw him as a useful moderate . \nHe continued quiet , subtly subversive activities such as ordaining priests to work underground in Czechoslovakia , without angering the authorities . \n1985 : Mikhail Gorbachev calls for Glasnost and Perestroika , Ethiopian Famine On 16 October 1978 Wojtyla was elected the first non-Italian Pope since Adrian VI , a Dutchman , in 1523 . \nHe took the name of his predecessor , John Paul , to symbolise his desire to consolidate the innovation of Pope John XXIII , who had presided over the Second Vatican Council , and the caution of Pope Paul VI . \nThe years of physical and spiritual survival in testing circumstances had shown him the value of conservatism , yet his intellectual curiosity and his understanding of the huge resources now offered the church by modern communications , technology and travel convinced him that the church could not stand still . \nFrom the start the Pope was almost frenzied . \nIn his first year as pontiff , he visited Mexico , Poland , the US and Ireland . \nIn Poland , he received an ecstatic welcome from huge crowds , giving a massive boost to the trade union , Solidarity . \nHis appointment came at a critical time . \nWith the invasion of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union and the election of Ronald Reagan in the US . \nthe Cold War suddenly got much colder . \nThough lauded as a modernist because of his informal style and his willingness to intervene to influence current affairs , his conservatism was often evident too . \nIn 1985 the Vatican declared that homosexuality was an ` intrinsic moral evil ' and must be seen as an ` objective disorder ' . \nIn 1988 the Pope ruled out women becoming priests . \nHis aim was to preserve the Catholic church by making it fitter for the modern world , not to change the church itself . \nAnd when in 1989 nearly 300 theologians signed The Cologne Declaration criticising the Vatican for its authoritarianism , Rome imposed an oath of obedience on anyone in authority in the church to the teachings laid down by the Pope and the college of bishops . \n1989 : The means of transmitting Aids is discovered , Berlin Wall falls . \nIn his last years , the Pope again showed his extraordinary capacity to respond to world events . \nShortly after the fall of the Berlin Wall , he held a historic meeting with the Soviet President , Mikhail Gorbachev , in the Vatican . \nIn 1998 he made an astonishing trip to Cuba -

' \nAlthough the defector has never been formally identified , it appears he was an Iraqi chemical engineer who defected after UN inspectors left the country in 1998 . \nIn the aftermath of the US-led invasion , Iraqis whom Curveball claimed were co-workers in Saddam 's alleged biological weapons program did not know who he was . \nHe claimed he 'd witnessed a deadly biological weapons accident when he was not even in Iraq when it was meant to have happened . \nAfter September 2001 , his claims were given greater credibility despite the fact that he was not in Iraq at the time he claimed to have taken part in illicit weapons work . \nHis information was central to an October 2002 National Intelligence Estimate that concluded Iraq ` has ' biological weapons , and was widely used by President Bush and Dick Cheney to make their case for war . \nIt now appears there were problems with Curveball from the start , but the intelligence community was willing to believe him ` because the tales he told were consistent with what they already believed . ' \nIn May 2000 doubts about his credibility surfaced when he was examined for signs that he had been exposed to biological agents . \nWhile the results were inconclusive , a US official was surprised to find Curveball had a hangover and said he ` might be an alcoholic . ' \nBy early 2001 , the Germans were having doubts of their own , telling the CIA their spy was ` out of control ' . \nBut warnings were dismissed . \nIntelligence analysts who voiced concern were ` forced to leave ' the unit mainly responsible for analyzing his claims , the commission found . \nAt every turn analysts were blocked by spy chiefs and their warning never passed on to policy-makers . \nThe commission 's report is unlikely to renew confidence in America 's intelligence network as it attempts to uncover evidence of WMDs in Iran and elsewhere . \nThe report concludes that US intelligence agencies remain poorly coordinated , have resisted reform and produce ` irrelevant ' work . \nDozens of insurgents attacked Abu Ghraib prison outside Baghdad yesterday , detonating two suicide car bombs and firing rocket-propelled grenades at US forces before the assault was repelled . \nAt least 20 US soldiers and 12 detainees were wounded in the fighting , which lasted around an hour . \n"}
{"id": "315", "time": "2005-03-22", "text": "` I 'll hold Blair to account ' Reg Keys was n't interested in politics until his son Tom was killed in Iraq in a war he insists was ` illegal and immoral ' . \nWhich makes him the ideal candidate to stand against the prime minister in his Sedgefield constituency , he tells Stuart Jeffries `` I 've always been a great fan of Muhammad Ali and his philosophy , '' says Reg Keys . \n`` Whenever he got into the ring with Sonny Liston or George Foreman , nobody gave him a chance . \nBut he always believed that he could win . \nAnd , when it really mattered , he did . '' \nThese are words that may well give Tony Blair a chill . \nFor Keys intends to stand against the prime minister in his Sedgefield constituency in the general election , which is likely to be held on May 5 . \nAnd Keys is n't just the run-of-the-mill , third-rate Tory candidate who usually contests safe Labor seats like Sedgefield ; rather , he is someone who believes he has the singular moral authority to defeat Blair at the polls for taking Britain to war in Iraq . \nFor several weeks now , a group of Westminster MPs , along with the musician and record producer - and former Blairite - Brian Eno , have been looking for an independent candidate with sufficient clout to topple Blair from his safe seat in County Durham . \nTheir aim was to find someone akin to Martin Bell , the former BBC reporter who , as an independent candidate , ousted the disgraced Conservative MP for Tatton , Neil Hamilton , in 1997 . \nIn Keys , a 52-year-old retired ambulance training manager from the West Midlands , they believe they have found their man . \n`` Unlike Martin Bell , I do n't wear a white suit and I 'm not used to the media . \nI 've got a Midlands accent and I 'm an introvert , '' says Keys . \n`` I 'm not exactly what you 'd expect of a politician , but I do know that I can embarrass Tony Blair . '' \nThe reason he believes this is that Keys is a bereaved father who has entered the political process not out of personal ambition but to honor the memory of his dead son . \nLance Corporal Tom Keys was a British military policeman killed by a 500-strong mob of Iraqis in the volatile Shia city of al Majarr al Kabir in June 2003 . \nKeys believes that his son went to Iraq trusting the false prospectus for war that Blair set before the House of Commons . \n`` I want to hold Tony Blair to account for his deceit , '' he says . \n`` I remember the last time I saw Tom , at New Street Station in Birmingham in February 2003 , when he marched off down that platform with his chest puffed out , proud to be off to do his duty for Britain . \nHe believed what he was told ... But Blair lied to him , and to all those other 84 soldiers who came home in coffins after fighting in a war that was illegal and immoral . '' \nDoes he really believe that he can topple the prime minister in a constituency where , historically , they do n't so much count Labor votes as weigh them ? \n`` I have got to believe that I can . \nWhenever I have any doubts about what I am doing I just think about Tom . \nI just think of when I dressed Tom and brushed his hair when his remains were returned to me , his body riddled with bullet holes . \n`` I suppose the Paxman question is ` Why are you standing in Sedgefield - you 're not from there at all ? ' \nBut it 's also true that Tony Blair is n't a local . \nHe was educated in Scotland and lives in London . \nYes , he has a house in the constituency , but the only time he comes to Sedgefield is when he 's with his posh friends and he wants a photo opportunity . \nI am as local as he is . '' \nKeys longs for a face-to-face debate with Blair about the war . \n`` I would love that challenge . \nIf he believes his actions were just and that no ministerial codes were broken , then he has nothing to fear . \nI do n't believe , though , that he has nothing to hide . \nHe knew that the intelligence that was used to justify war was shaky . '' \nKeys had originally intended to stand against Defense Secretary Geoff Hoon in his Ashfield constituency . \n`` Then I met this hostage negotiator called Felicity Arbuthnot who worked with -LRB- the murdered aid worker -RRB- Margaret Hassan , and she said , why not stand against Blair ? \nShe put me in touch with Brian Eno and some of his friends , and I realized that it would be a good idea . '' \nWho 's bankrolling your campaign ? \n`` Well , not Brian Eno . \nHe 's given us his moral support and let us use his studio in London , but he is n't backing us financially . \nSo far we 're just surviving on minor donations of # 100 and # 200 , but hopefully we 'll get some bigger donations as the campaign goes on . \nI 'm struggling to pay the # 50-a-night bed and breakfast bills . '' \nHe says that a local pub has offered him the free use of a back room as campaign headquarters . \nNot the Dun Cow , the Sedgefield pub where Blair has entertained several world leaders in recent years ? \n`` No , the pub which offered us the room does n't want its name disclosed . '' \nThe question now is whether Keys and his supporters can encourage other political parties that had intended to contest Sedgefield to stand down so that he can get a straight fight with Blair . \n`` The Tory candidate has already stood down . \nI do n't know for certain whether they 're going to put anyone else up in their place , but I think it 's unlikely , '' says Keys . \n`` I 'm not sure whether the Lib Dems are going to stand , but I am hoping that we can negotiate with them . \nAlready an anti-war independent candidate has decided to throw his weight - both moral and financial - behind me . '' \nHe also hopes to convince another potential independent candidate , the former spy David Shayler , to stand down . \n`` We 're trying to have a negotiation with him , but it may be that he has a book he wants to promote . '' \nYesterday , Keys arrived in Sedgefield to test the water for his campaign . \nIt would take a 22 % swing for him to defeat Blair , who , in 2001 , was elected with a majority of 17,713 . \nWhat struck him about the town ? \n`` It was how run down the school playgrounds looked , and it just made me think of the # 5bn that was wasted on the war , how far money like that would have gone in making places for our children to play properly . '' \nIs n't Sedgefield a constituency from which many British soldiers come and so would have strong views about your campaign ? \n`` That 's right . \nWhat amazed me , though , is that some people I have spoken to need to be educated . \nSome seemed to think that Saddam was involved in 9\\/11 and that there were weapons of mass destruction . '' \nHe says that one of the first people he met was a soldier on leave . \n`` He was just a young lad , like my son Tom was . \nAnd he really disagreed with what I was doing . \nHe said : ' I signed on the dotted line , so no one can really complain when I 'm killed on active service . ' \n`` I can understand him saying that . \nBut what happened with Tom was that he was killed in the middle of a war we should n't have been fighting , and killed in a manner that showed the army had underestimated the danger of the situation into which they were sending those young men . \nTom had , when he was 18 , been part of a mission with the SAS to rescue a regiment . \nHad he been killed in that action , no argument . \nOr had he been killed by a weapon of mass destruction while on active service in Iraq , no argument . \nBut he was n't . '' \nKeys argues that his son died as part of an army blunder . \n`` Three weeks before Tom was killed , the army had what it called a ` scale down ' . \nThey took away his morphine , grenades and all his ammunition except just 50 rounds . \nIt also took away the radio masts , so that all they had were vehicle-mounted , year-old Clansman radios , which were notoriously unreliable . \nThey tried to get hold of satellite phones but for some reason they were refused . \n`` In that condition he was sent to this volatile Shia city where he and his section found a violent mob of 500 heading for the police station . \nThey did n't have a chance . \nThe Iraqi police fled , but Tom and the rest of them fought until they had no more ammunition . \nThen they were killed by a mob in a ritualistic fashion , which is common there . '' \nAll six of the British Red Caps were murdered . \n`` There were no medals or honor for them . \nThere was no letter from Tony Blair . \nInstead , he managed to find time to write a letter of condolence for Ozzy Osbourne when he fell off his quad bike . \nBut not to my son , who was shot 31 times . \nI ca n't help but think angrily about that , and about Tom 's beautiful green eyes . \nHe was four days short of his 21st birthday . '' \nHe does have happier memories . \n`` Before Tom went to Iraq , everything was rosy . \nWe were a family of four . \nI had retired , as had my wife , who was a hospital ward manager . \nWe had moved to a barn conversion in Bala in north Wales . \nAll that life has been ruined for us . '' \nIs it difficult to be a political candidate in these circumstances , when you are still clearly grieving ? \n`` Yes it is . \nIt 's worse for my wife . \nWe 're both very fragile , but it is worse for her . \nMy son is buried in a beautiful grave at Llanaber near Barmouth in Wales . \nA very picturesque spot overlooking the sea . \nBut my wife ca n't bring herself to go there . \nShe ca n't quite bring herself to see his name on the grave . \nIt 's too final . \n`` I feel , though , that I have a responsibility to Tom . \nI keep going back to the words of a widow of a man who died on the Kursk -LRB- the Soviet nuclear submarine whose crew perished in 2000 in an underwater disaster after a leakage of torpedo motor fuel exploded -RRB- . \nShe said : ` If you betray your country you are a traitor and you will go to prison . \nBut if your country betrays you , what can you do ? ' \nI think I have an answer to that : we can use our vote to get rid of those people who betrayed my son and other men like him . \nThat 's what I want the people of Sedgefield to do . '' \n"}

'' \nThe fate of the reform package could be decided at a meeting on Sunday or Monday between the four countries and representatives of the 53 African countries . \nThe expansion was proposed this year by Kofi Annan , the UN secretary general , to reflect today 's reality rather than the situation after the second world war . \nThe reform is also intended to help rebuild the UN 's reputation after criticism of its record in the Balkans , Rwanda and Iraq . \nMr Annan , after a two-day debate at the UN this week , said : `` I think we all have to admit that the council can be more democratic and more representative . \n`` There is a democracy deficit in the UN governance that has to be corrected . '' \nHis plan is intended to be the centrepiece of a meeting of world leaders at the UN in September , billed as the world summit . \nJapan , Germany , Brazil and India , who have organised themselves into the `` G4 '' , have mounted one of the biggest lobbying exercises in history , pushing their embassies to redouble efforts and even recalling retired diplomats with good contacts to help out . \nThey have called in many favors . \nThe G4 tabled a resolution on Monday , but after two days of debate they found more opposition than they anticipated . \nThe G4 foreign ministers are scheduled to meet on Sunday to decide whether to press ahead . \nThe security council is dominated by five members with permanent seats and a veto : the US , Britain , France , Russia and China , the second world war victors in 1945 . \nThe other 10 are rotated on a two-year basis . \nThe permanent presence of countries such as Britain and France and the absence of a permanent place for any country from Africa , Latin America or for Japan , the third biggest financial contributor to the UN , has long been seen as unfair by many in the general assembly . \nThe G4 proposes six permanent seats without veto power and four non-permanent seats . \nBut , according to the security council source , the G4 is being opposed by Argentina and Chile , which want to block Brazil ; Italy and , to a lesser extent , Spain , which are reluc tant to endorse Germany ; and Pakistan , which is intent on stopping India . \nThe G4 is also being opposed at present by all 53 states from Africa - itself almost enough to prevent the necessary majority . \nGeorge Bush , meanwhile , has not forgiven the German chancellor , Gerhard Schrder , for his opposition to the Iraq war . \nShirin Tahir-Kheli , a US envoy responsible for UN reform , told the general assembly that the US would vote against the resolution . \nMs Tahir-Kheli acknowledged that 2005 was not 1945 , but said `` security council reform alone will not address the most pressing problems of the organization '' . \nRussia and China are also opposed ; but Sir Emyr Jones Parry , the British ambassador , while making it clear the British government would not give up its place or its veto , told the general assembly Britain would vote for the G4 resolution . \nThe African countries yesterday tabled a resolution of their own proposing a 26-member security council in which Africa would have four places instead of the three proposed by the G4 . \nGunter Pleuger , Germany 's UN ambassador , still insisted : `` We feel that the votes are there .

'' \nThe senate majority leader , Bill Frist , a Republican , said Democrats were resorting to `` partisan war chants '' . \nIn the house of representatives , Rush Holt , a Democrat , introduced legislation for an investigation that would compel senior administration officials to turn over records relating to the Plame disclosure . \nMr Rove 's attorney , Robert Luskin , said yesterday that his client had testified truthfully to the grand jury and expected to be exonerated . \n`` Karl provided all pertinent information to prosecutors a long time ago , '' Mr Luskin said . \n`` And prosecutors confirmed when he testified most recently in October 2004 that he is not a target of the investigation . '' \nIn an a CNN interview yesterday , before the latest revelation , Mr Wilson kept up his criticism of the White House , saying Mr Rove 's conduct was an `` outrageous abuse of power ... certainly worthy of frog-marching out of the White House '' . \n"}

'' \nThe report 's most radical proposal , to end the human rights commission , fits in with Bush administration wishes . \nIn place of the commission , which meets for only six weeks a year , it proposes a smaller and less politicised council that can meet regularly . \nMr Annan says the existing commission has `` been increasingly undermined by its declining credibility and professionalism '' . \nEchoing Washington 's argument , he said some states had sought membership on the commission `` not to strengthen human rights , but to protect themselves against criticism , or to criticise others '' . \nHuman Rights Watch and Amnesty International applauded the proposal but said that any reforms should retain independent investigators and an ability for witnesses and victims to testify . \nOther controversial recommendations build on those of a high-level panel that Mr Annan set up last year to study security threats and challenges . \nIt called for international agreement on a new definition of terrorism to outlaw all attacks on civilians , and proposed a change in the balance between state sovereignty and the right of states to intervene . \nThe plan for a universal definition of terrorism ran into criticism from Algeria and other Arab states , who fear it may rule out the right of armed resistance to foreign occupation . \nIn a move that will please developing countries , the report calls for new powers for the economic and social council that many feel has been sidelined by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund . \nIt should hold annual ministerial-level meetings to review progress towards the UN millennium development goals , Mr Annan says . \nFrance 's UN ambassador , Jean-Marc de la Sabliere , summed up general reaction to the report when he said it was `` ambitious but achievable '' . \n"}

they allow people from different class backgrounds , from different regions , from different races to debate policy knowing that the conclusion of the debate will be the determination of a particular course of action . \nThere are no debates now because there is no question about what action will be taken . \nThe Chancellor 's peculiarly Presbyterian form of neo-liberalism is absolutely not open for debate . \nIf it were , then the scandal of PFI , which represents a continuous tax on the poor by the rich , would be common knowledge . \nWorse in the short term , this lack of debate has allowed no political dissent from the disastrous economic policy of running deficits to fund unproductive investment . \nOld Labor used to run deficits to employ low-paid workers in the unproductive old public sector ; New Labor runs deficits to employ highly-paid consultants in the even more unproductive new public sector . \nIn the only industry that I know at first hand , the scale of government handouts is jawdropping . \nNew Labor has created a new film body , the Film Council , whose overheads now exceed the production budgets of the very efficient bodies that it replaced . \nThere is enormously wasteful duplication of government resources . \nFriends from every sector report the same story . \nIt is true that your news management is breathtakingly effective but I do not think this is cause for congratulation . \nYou have produced systems of Treasury funding in which there 's always a government nark in the room and you have backed it up with a relentless use of patronage which would make an 18th-century Whig blush . \nNo one dares to complain about the Film Council , for example , because they know it will prejudice their next funding application . \nLast week a woman broke down in tears at one of the fringe meetings when she recounted how she could n't talk about Iraq in her constituency . \nLooking at Wolfgang being manhandled from the hall , I was reminded of that chilling footage when Saddam staged his coup in the Baath party at a meeting of the central committee and pointed out the individuals who were to be frogmarched from the room . \nThis is Britain , so what awaited Walter Wolfgang outside the conference doors was not a bullet in the head . \nThe lady 's tears were caused by her fear of expulsion , not of imprisonment . \nIf the method is soft , however , the totalitarian desire to crush debate is hard . \nIf Nazi Germany was fascism by radio , New Labor is the corporate state by television . \nThe determination to control the party 's image on television is incompatible with a democratic party and , indeed , with democracy . \nI have not been an activist for decades . \nI live in Islington and watching Margaret Hodge and the Loony Left morph effortlessly into New Labor was not a pretty sight . \nNetworking with power-mad social climbers was not my idea of the good life . \nI have remained a member of the Labor party , however , because it still seemed to me to be a way of connecting at the national level with people who shared my beliefs in the possibility of a fairer and more equal society . \nLast week has made clear what I 've known but not wanted to admit for at least six years : that you have made it impossible for me to enjoy any such connection . \nFor well over a century the Labor party has provided a crucial forum where the marginal and the powerless could speak . \nYou have ensured that this is no longer the case . \nThe white working class of this country has lost its most important institutional voice as it undergoes the most brutal economic transformation since the Industrial Revolution . \nIndeed , it is clear that you yourself have no belief in any goal of real equality - the New Labor aim , Brown as well as Blair , is just to manage the underclass . \nOf course , there can be no debate . \nWhen I joined the Labor party I was a schoolboy and I remember learning Kipling 's poem ` Mesopotamia ' by heart . \nIt is a savage attack on the politicians who had sent young men to die pointlessly in what is now Iraq . \nIn a Labor party defined by its opposition to Suez and opposed to all imperial adventure , it seemed a poem about a far distant past . \nBut when I remember it now under a Labor government in the 21st century , it seems directly contemporary . \nYou have told the world , to this country 's enduring risk and shame , that Britain will back any American government , no matter how dangerous , in pursuing reckless schemes of military adventure . \nIn so doing , you despise all the Labor party 's best traditions . \nKipling puts it better than I can : -LRB- Your -RRB- lives can not repay us - -LRB- your deaths -RRB- could not undo - The shame that -LRB- you -RRB- have laid upon our race . \nBut the slothfulness that wasted and the arrogance that slew , Shall we leave it unabated in its place ? \nA longer version of this letter will be published in Critical Quarterly vol .48 . \n"}

Critics have suggested that the sympathetic portrayal of US troops in The Tiger and the Snow is a craven appeal to the American box office The Oscar-winning Italian actor-director Roberto Benigni looks certain to stir a lively debate on whether you can mix comedy and carnage when his latest movie is released next week . \nThe Tiger and the Snow -LRB- La tigre e la Neve -RRB- is said to be the first full-length feature film to be set in post-invasion Iraq - and its climactic scene is a gag on the theme of suicide bombing . \nBut the mix of humor and horror failed to shock the Italian critics who got a first look at the movie this week . \nAnd that included critics writing for the conservative press which has hitherto been consistently hostile to the left-leaning Benigni . \n`` In the drama of a bombed and invaded Baghdad , weakened by 12 years of embargo , Benigni 's farce finds just the right element of contrast , '' wrote Il Giornale , the Milan daily owned by the family of Italy 's conservative prime minister , Silvio Berlusconi . \nBenigni 's latest film sees him back on the same delicate territory he trod eight years ago in Life is Beautiful , which was partly set in a Nazi concentration camp . \nThis time , he plays Attilio , a Rome university lecturer and poet madly , but forlornly , in love with a writer , Vittoria , played by his wife , Nicoletta Braschi . \nVittoria goes to Baghdad in 2003 to interview Iraq 's leading poet . \nAn Allied bombing raid puts the luckless Italian scribe into a coma and Attilio tricks his way into the war-torn country to bring her the medicines she needs but ca n't obtain in a Baghdad hospital . \nBlinded by passion to the risks he is courting , he dodges through minefields and crosses the desert by camel and motorbike . \nThe underlying message is the same as that of Life is Beautiful : love conquers all . \nA convinced left-winger , Benigni has been a persistent critic of Italy 's government . \nMr Berlusconi is a prime supporter of American policy in Iraq where the third-biggest contingent in the US-led coalition is made up of Italian troops . \nNot unnaturally , movie world observers had been expecting Benigni to come up with a pacifist film in which the Americans were the villains . \nBenigni insisted this week that The Tiger and the Snow was `` profoundly '' anti-war and , indeed , the Iraqi poet , Fuad , takes his own life in despair at the chaos brought by the US-led invasion . \nBut , Benigni told a press conference in Rome : `` In general , war films appeal to reason , to the head of the viewer . \nThis one points at the heart . \nThere is no ideology , but for that reason it is stronger . \nThe Tiger and the Snow does not takes sides overtly against the US-led invasion and , just as suprisingly perhaps , it shows the American military in a generally sympathetic light . \nOnly in one scene , depicting the search of a building , are American troops shown behaving roughly . \nWhen the movie 's hero appears at a checkpoint , apparently kitted out as a suicide bomber , they lower their guns on hearing he is a poet . \n`` I am not judging them '' , said Benigni . \n`` I know that they are often poor lads without work and without future . \nI feel pity for them . '' \nSeveral newspapers accused the actor-director of shying away from criticism of the Americans in the hope of repeating the US success of Life is Beautiful , which scooped three Oscars at the 1998 Academy awards . \nBut Benigni said it was not his job to sit in judgment . \nParadoxically , therefore , it could be Italy 's largely pacifist left that finds itself pondering whether to jeer or cheer . \n`` Unrealistic , silly , well-intentioned and opportunistic ? '' \nasked the critic of Italy 's most distinguished left-of-centre daily , La Repubblica . \nShe eventually concluded , however , that `` at a time of widespread , apocalyptic pessimism '' , The Tiger and the Snow sent a necessary message : `` Never lose hope , never give in to horror , never accept ruin , fight on , and be certain of making it in the end . '' \nIn case you were wondering about the film 's title , it is meant to convey the idea of two things that rarely come together - like war and laughter . \n"}

'' \nThis was a pronouncement to which Peck could personally attest . \nHe spent much of his life immersed in cheap gin , chain-smoking cigarettes and inhaling cannabis , and being persistently unfaithful to his wife , who eventually divorced him . \nHe also went through estrangement with two of his three children . \nPeck wrote openly of his adulterous affairs in another of his total of 15 books : In Search of Stones : A Pilgrimage of Faith , Reason and Discovery -LRB- 1995 -RRB- , based on a visit to Britain to see ancient stone monuments . \nNever lacking in personal honesty , at least in print , he once said he had `` the rare privilege of being able to give advice without having any responsibility '' . \nPeck , whose personalised car number plate was THLOST , also spent much of his life seeking religious fulfilment -LRB- he was baptised a Christian at 43 after embracing Zen and then Sufism -RRB- , and used this to explain his infidelities . \n`` There was an element of quest in my extramarital romances , '' he wrote . \n`` I was questing , through sexual romance , at least a brief visit to God 's castle . '' \nSuch visits , however brief , ceased when he became impotent , he disclosed . \nThe Road Less Travelled was written while Peck was running a successful private practice in Connecticut , but he received only $ 7,500 for publication after one publisher had dismissed it as `` too Christ-y '' . \nAlthough a slow starter , its eventual massive success established Peck on the lecture circuit as well as confirming a valuable new genre for American publishers . \nPeck was born in New York , the son of a lawyer who later became a judge . \nHis education at the Phillips Exeter academy was unhappy and he later attacked its `` Spartan , almost vicious adolescent culture '' . \nAfter psychological counselling , he moved to the Friends seminary , a Quaker school near Greenwich Village . \nThere he read about Zen and became a Buddhist , but retained an ambition to write `` the great American novel '' . \nAfter briefly attending Middlebury College , from where he was expelled for refusing the required officers ' training classes , he entered Harvard thanks to his father 's influence . \nHe graduated in social relations and , despite his literary desires , began studying medicine at Columbia University before graduating from Case-Western Reserve University school of medicine in Ohio in 1963 . \nWhile at Columbia Peck met and married Lily Ho , a Chinese student from Singapore . \nThis caused his father , who was half Jewish but always concealed it , to disown him -LRB- her parents disapproved , too -RRB- . \nBut he later relented and paid his son 's tuition fees . \nThen Peck joined the army because , he later said , he needed the regular pay to support his wife and a family ; yet he also opposed the Vietnam war , then escalating . \nHe rose to become assistant chief of psychiatry at the US surgeon general 's office in Washington DC from 1970 to 1972 , when he left the service with the rank of lieutentant colonel . \nYears of private practice began and he incorporated case histories into the Road book and others . \nAfter its success he followed with another bestseller , People of the Lie : The Hope for Healing Human Evil -LRB- 1983 -RRB- . \nIt was well received by critics , but with reservations about `` moral preachment '' . \nHis books included two novels and one for children . \nOther non-fiction included The Different Drum -LRB- 1987 -RRB- and sequels to his first book , Further Along the Road Less Travelled -LRB- 1993 -RRB- and The Road Less Traveled and Beyond -LRB- 1997 -RRB- . \nHis last work was Glimpses of the Devil -LRB- 2005 -RRB- , recounting his fascination with exorcism . \nThe success of his books was partly based on their mystical-spiritual content and although Peck always eschewed the idea of being a guru , there were cultish aspects to his popularity . \nOf this he said : `` Half the time when people want to touch my robe , it feels incredibly icky - yuck ! \nThe rest of the time , it feels very good , honest , right .

{"id": "116", "time": "2005-08-07", "text": "This is an extract from Robin Cook 's resignation speech to the House of Commons , 17 March 2003 . \nIt electrified Parliament and will be remembered as one of the most important addresses in modern Westminster history . \nThis is the first time for 20 years that I have addressed the House from the back benches . \nI must confess that I had forgotten how much better the view is from here . \nI have chosen to address the House first on why I can not support a war without international agreement or domestic support . \nThe present Prime Minister is the most successful leader of the Labor Party in my lifetime . \nI applaud the heroic efforts that the Prime Minister has made in trying to secure a second resolution -LRB- at the United Nations -RRB- . \nI do not think that anybody could have done better than the Foreign Secretary in working to get support for a second resolution within the Security Council . \nBut the very intensity of those attempts underlines how important it was to succeed . \nNow that those attempts have failed , we can not pretend that getting a second resolution was of no importance . \nThe reality is that Britain is being asked to embark on a war without agreement in any of the international bodies of which we are a leading partner - not Nato , not the European Union and , now , not the Security Council . \nOnly a year ago , we and the United States were part of a coalition against terrorism that was wider and more diverse than I would ever have imagined possible . \nHistory will be astonished at the diplomatic miscalculations that led so quickly to the disintegration of that powerful coalition . \nOur interests are best protected not by unilateral action but by multilateral agreement and a world order governed by rules . \nYet tonight the international partnerships most important to us are weakened : the European Union is divided ; the Security Council is in stalemate . \nThose are heavy casualties of a war in which a shot has yet to be fired . \nI have heard some parallels between military action in these circumstances and the military action that we took in Kosovo . \nThere was no doubt about the multilateral support that we had for the action that we took in Kosovo . \nIt was supported by Nato ; it was supported by the European Union ; it was supported by every single one of the seven neighbors in the region . \nFrance and Germany were our active allies . \nIt is precisely because we have none of that support in this case that it was all the more important to get agreement in the Security Council as the last hope of demonstrating international agreement . \nOur difficulty in getting support this time is that neither the international community nor the British public is persuaded that there is an urgent and compelling reason for this military action in Iraq . \nNone of us can predict the death toll of civilians from the forthcoming bombardment of Iraq , but the US warning of a bombing campaign that will ` shock and awe ' makes it likely that casualties will be numbered at least in the thousands . \nFor four years as Foreign Secretary I was partly responsible for the western strategy of containment . \nOver the past decade that strategy destroyed more weapons than in the Gulf war , dismantled Iraq 's nuclear weapons program and halted Saddam 's medium and long-range missiles programs . \nIraq 's military strength is now less than half its size than at the time of the last Gulf war . \nSome advocates of conflict claim that Saddam 's forces are so weak , so demoralised and so badly equipped that the war will be over in a few days . \nWe can not base our military strategy on the assumption that Saddam is weak and at the same time justify pre-emptive action on the claim that he is a threat . \nIraq probably has no weapons of mass destruction in the commonly understood sense of the term - namely a credible device capable of being delivered against a strategic city target . \nWhy is it now so urgent that we should take military action to disarm a military capacity that has been there for 20 years , and which we helped to create ? \nIt has been a favorite theme of commentators that this House no longer occupies a central role in British politics . \nNothing could better demonstrate that they are wrong than for this House to stop the commitment of troops in a war that has neither international agreement nor domestic support . \nI intend to join those tomorrow night who will vote against military action now . \nIt is for that reason , and for that reason alone , and with a heavy heart , that I resign from the government . \n"}
{"id": "183", "time": "2005-08-07", "text": "Westminster mourns sudden death of leading Labor firebrand and orator Wife at 59-year-old MP 's side after failed resuscitation on Scottish hillside Robin Cook , the former Foreign Secretary , died in hospital last night after collapsing while walking in the Scottish hills he loved . \nThe 59-year-old MP was airlifted to hospital in Inverness yesterday afternoon after being taken ill while walking with his wife , Gaynor , and friends near the summit of Ben Stack , close to Lochinver , Sutherland . \nThere were unconfirmed reports last night that he suffered a heart attack and then fell , breaking his neck . \nAn unnamed friend who was with the MP on the mountain attempted to give Cook mouth-to-mouth resuscitation for 30 minutes before an Coastguard helicopter arrived at the scene . \nThe helicopter 's crew continued efforts to revive Cook on the journey to Raigmore hospital where he was pronounced dead at 4.05 pm , shortly after arrival . \nCook , who also leaves two sons , Christopher and Peter , was a dominant intellectual force in New Labor . \nHe sealed his reputation for political integrity with his resignation from the cabinet on the eve of the Iraq war . \nHis death last night left colleagues in shock , eliciting tributes from across the political spectrum to the man whom John Prescott , the Deputy Prime Minister , described as ` the greatest parliamentarian of his generation ' . \nPrime Minister Tony Blair was also quick to pay tribute . \n` Robin was an outstanding , extraordinary talent - brilliant , incisive in debate , of incredible skill and persuasive power , ' he said . \n` His contribution to the politics of Britain was hugely significant . \nHis contribution to the Labor Party was immense . \nHe will be missed and mourned by all of us . ' \nIronically , friends said Cook had never appeared healthier and happier since leaving office : he was a keen outdoorsman who kept fit by riding and walking . \nGordon Brown , the Chancellor , who had known Cook since they were university students , said his thoughts were with Gaynor and the family . \n` With his death so sudden and unexpected , the tragic loss to his family , his constituency , our party and our country is all the greater and is most keenly felt by all of us who knew him and will now miss him greatly , ' Brown said last night . \n` Robin 's mastery of the Commons was acknowledged on all sides and his incisive mind , forensic skills and formidable and wide-ranging debating prowess were seen by the public very clearly when , in opposition , he led the response to the Scott inquiry . ' \nIn an age of image-conscious politicians , the diminutive , ginger-bearded Cook did not cut a fashionable figure , but his fiercely burning intellect propelled him to the heights of the New Labor firmament , earning the respect even of his foes . \nHe was admired by his civil servants for the apparently effortless speed with which he mastered his briefs and his constant hunger for ideas , but he was also a cultured man , as happy to discuss Victorian novelists as the season 's racing form . \nDespite forging a career on the back benches as a quietly devastating critic of foreign policy , tribal loyalty saw him return to the fold to campaign for Tony Blair 's re-election in May . \nOccasionally given to prickliness , Cook was not always an easy man , but his dry wit and sense of mischief endeared him to friends . \nHe spoke movingly of how marriage to his second wife , his former secretary Gaynor Regan , had changed him , teaching him 'em otional intelligence ' and giving him an ability to relate to others ' feelings . \nBorn in Bellshill in February 1946 , Robin Cook went to school in Aberdeen and Edinburgh before going on to read English literature at Edinburgh University - where he met his first wife , Margaret , a consultant hematologist . \nHe became an MP in 1974 , rising swiftly through the opposition ranks , and when Labor gained power in 1997 , was appointed Foreign Secretary , devising the ethical foreign policy that crystallised the optimism of the early New Labor years . \nHis proudest achievement in office , he said , was when Britain intervened to halt ethnic cleansing in Kosovo . \nAfter the 2001 general election , he was moved abruptly sideways to Leader of the Commons , a job he did not initially want but which became a showcase for his wit - and his tenacious pursuit of House of Lords reform . \n` It 's hard to think of anyone who matched him over the dispatch box - he had such a formidable mind , ' said Stephen Twigg , his deputy during those years . \nIn the rare moments that he relaxed , however , Cook could be great company . \n` He was hugely funny . \nI remember we had a Christmas night out - it ended up being in about February . \nHe took us all to a jazz club in Camden ; he loved jazz , ' Twigg added . \nDenis MacShane , the former Europe minister who also worked closely with Cook , said his thoughts were with Cook 's wife and family . \n` Robin has illuminated British politics , and especially those of the democratic left , for more than 30 years , ' he said . \n` Even half an insight from Robin was worth 10 speeches from most politicians . ' \nLocal emergency services started to receive reports just after 2.30 pm yesterday that the Livingston MP had collapsed near the summit of Ben Stack , 2,365 ft above sea level . \nAs Cook 's friends waited for the Coastguard helicopter to arrive , they were given guidance on resuscitation techniques by medical experts via telephone . \nThe helicopter 's crew then battled to revive him using cardio-pulmonary resuscitation equipment , before airlifting the unconscious politician to Raigmore hospital . \nCook 's wife was rushed by police car to the hospital where she watched as doctors unsuccessfully attempted to save his life . \nCook was a keen hill-walker , and regularly spent his summer holidays with close family and friends enjoying the dramatic mountain scenery of Highland Scotland , rather than going abroad . \nThe announcement of his death was delayed for three hours as police contacted relatives . \nLast night , friends of Cook said his demise had left a huge gap in British politics . \n` His death leaves a gaping hole in the leadership of the Labor movement . ' \nsaid Tony Woodley , general secretary of the Transport and General Workers ' Union . \n` He was a socialist and an internationalist of principle and we are all left poorer by his passing , ' . \nFormer deputy Labor leader Roy Hattersley said Cook 's death would be felt keenly in the House of Commons . ' \nI do n't think there has been any parliamentarian of my time who has made more significant speeches , ' Hattersley said . \n"}
{"id": "40", "time": "2005-08-07", "text": "The liberals who say I have deserted the left should ask themselves where they stand on Islamism Looking back on how his generation covered up the crimes of communism in the 1930s , WH Auden explained that he and his friends were n't true communists but fellow travellers . \nAt home they defended civil liberties and stood up for freedom of speech . \nAbroad , they tolerated atrocities precisely because they did n't impinge on them . \n` Our great error , ' said Auden , ` was not a false admiration for Russia but a snobbish feeling that nothing which happened in a semi-barbarous country which had experienced neither the Renaissance nor the Enlightenment could be of any importance : had any of the countries we knew personally , like France , Germany or Italy , the language of which we could speak and where we had personal friends , been one to have a successful communist revolution with the same phenomena of terror , purges , censorship etc , we would have screamed our heads off . ' \nTo speak of the ` Auden generation ' is to perpetuate a myth of the Thirties . \nThe majority of the population , including the majority of Labor supporters , never read an Auden poem or hitched a ride with communism . \nWhat is meant is the ` progressive ' middle-class left : publishers , authors , academics , teachers , liberal journalists , the odd lawyer and odder advocate of various forms of alternative life styles . \nPeople like me , in short . \nIn their later years , most tried a defense which Auden was too honest , and too filled with disgust at his younger self , to advance . \nOur priority was fighting fascism , the excuse-making ran . \nWe were faced with a psychopathic movement of the extreme right which was dripping in blood . \nIt looks bad now that we went along with Stalin , but we were socialists and he called what he was doing socialism , and in any event we had other priorities . \nToday 's middle-class left is made up of the same types as 70 years ago . \nThe faults of small-mindedness and self-righteousness and the virtues of instinctive suspicion of the British establishment and sympathy for the British underdog have n't changed either . \nWhat 's new is that no one truly believes in socialism . \nWhen Tony Blair goes we will have the first Labor leadership election without a serious left-wing candidate . \nIndeed , it is impossible to imagine what a serious left-wing candidate would look like and what his or her program might be . \nI 'm sure that any halfway competent political philosopher could rip the assumptions of modern middle-class left-wingery apart . \nWhy is it right to support a free market in sexual relationships but oppose free-market economics , for instance ? \nBut his criticisms would have little impact . \nIt 's like a religion : the contradictions are obvious to outsiders but do n't disturb the faithful . \nYou believe when you 're in its warm embrace . \nAlas , I 'm out . \nLast week , after 44 years of regular church-going , the bell tolled , the book was closed and the candle was extinguished . \nThe officiating bishop was Peter Wilby , a former editor of the New Statesman and a friend of long-standing , who delivered his anathema in the Guardian . \nThe immediate heresy was a piece I 'd written about how difficult the courts made it to deport suspected Islamist terrorists . \nAs I 'd campaigned to protect asylum seekers in the past , Wilby used the article as damning evidence of ' a rightwards lurch ' . \nThe old bat did n't understand that genuine asylum seekers are the victims of the world 's greatest criminals - four million fled Saddam Hussein - not criminals themselves . \nEven if he 'd grasped that the Mail was wrong and real refugees were n't villains , I doubt it would have made a difference . \nMy mortal sin had been to question ` harshly the motives of the anti-war movement ' , and to that I had to plead guilty . \nThe least attractive characteristic of the middle-class left - one shared with the Thatcherites - is its refusal to accept that its opponents are sincere . \nThe legacy of Marx and Freud allows it to dismiss criticisms as masks which hide corruption , class interests , racism , sexism - any motive can be implied except fundamental differences of principle . \nWilby went through a long list of what could have motivated mine and similar ` betrayals ' . \nPerhaps we became right wing as we got older . \nPerhaps we wanted to stick our snouts into the deep troughs of the Tory press . \nPerhaps taking out a mortgage committed us to the capitalist system or having children encouraged petit bourgeois individualism of the most anti-social kind . \nGenerously in light of the above charge sheet , he plumped for the conclusion that our restless minds just got bored with the ` straitjacket ' of left-wing thought . \nWe left the slog of building a better world to the decent plodders . \nGenerous to me , and over-generous to allegedly left-wing thought . \nWhat he and a large part of the mainstream liberal-left do n't and wo n't confront is that they have become the fellow travellers of the psychopathic far-right . \nMany emotions have been stirred by the grisly spectacle - anger , scorn and incredulity among them - but boredom , no , never boredom . \nAs in the 1930s , there 's little doubt that few apart from George Galloway and others in the gruesome leadership of the anti-war movement were keen on saluting Saddam Hussein . \nThe reason why one million people marched through London without one mounting a platform to express solidarity with the victims of fascism was that it never occurred to them that there were people in Iraq who shared their values . \nIt felt like nit-picking to point this out at the time . \nWars are usually worth opposing , especially capricious wars advocated by a slippery Prime Minister in alliance with a repellent US President . \nBut arguments have their own dynamic . \nIf you start by refusing to look Baathism or Islamism in the face , the logic of blaming everything on Tony Blair and George W Bush pushes you into making ever more excuses for the extreme right . \nAuden noticed a retreat from universal principles in the 1930s - communism was fine in ` semi-barbaric ' Russia but would have been a screaming outrage in a civilised country . \nHe should have been alive today . \nWith no socialism to provide international solidarity , good motives of tolerance and respect for other cultures have had the unintended consequence of leading a large part of post-modern liberal opinion into the position of 19th-century imperialists . \nIt is presumptuous and oppressive to suggest that other cultures want the liberties we take for granted , their argument runs . \nSo it may be , but believe that and the upshot is that democracy , feminism and human rights become good for whites but not for browns and brown-skinned people who contradict you are the tools of the neo-conservatives . \nOn the other hand when confronted with a movement of contemporary imperialism - Islamism wants an empire from the Philippines to Gibraltar - and which is tyrannical , homophobic , misogynist , racist and homicidal to boot , they feel it is valid because it is against Western culture . \nIt expresses its feelings in a regrettably brutal manner perhaps , but that ca n't hide its authenticity . \nThe result of this inversion of principles has been that liberals ca n't form alliances with the victims of al-Qaeda in Afghanistan or Iraq any more than the Auden generation could form alliances with the victims of Stalinism . \nThis is n't simply about international relations . \nWho is going to help the victims of religious intolerance in Britain 's immigrant communities ? \nNot the Liberal Democrats , who have never once offered support to liberal and democrats in Iraq . \nNor an anti-war left which prefers to embrace a Muslim Association of Britain and Yusuf al-Qaradawi who believe that Muslims who freely decide to change their religion or renounce religion should be executed . \nIf the Archbishop of Canterbury were to suggest the same treatment for renegade Christians all hell would break loose . \nBut as the bigotry comes from ` the other ' there is silence . \nPerhaps it will break soon . \nThere always was far more disquiet on the left at this ` rightwards lurch ' than the Guardian or Radio 4 admitted . \nIf my emails are a guide , the London bombs have added a practical reason for breaking with the consensus : now they 're trying to kill us . \nEven if people think that the Iraq war has made Britain a bigger target , they are still confronted with a fascistic cult of murder and self-murder which allows no compromise . \nThe thing to watch for with fellow travellers is what shocks them into pulling the emergency cord and jumping off the train . \nI know some will stay on to the terminus , and when the man with the rucksack explodes his bomb their dying words will be : ` It 's not your fault . \nI blame Tony Blair . ' \nMy advice to my former comrades is to struggle out of your straitjackets and get off at the next station . \nIt would be good to see you on this side of the barrier . \n"}

'' \nThe former international development secretary Clare Short told Channel 4 News last night : `` I think the government had to try and cover it up because it is so devastating . \n`` The bit that was blacked out shows that the attorney general changed his mind twice in a matter of days before he gave advice to the cabinet when he just said unequivocally , ` My view is that there is legal authority for war ' , and kept from the cabinet any suggestion that he had had doubts about it .

'' \nThe central goal of the al-Qaida-inspired campaign , as its statements have regularly spelled out , is the withdrawal of US and other western forces from the Arab and Muslim world , an end to support for Israeli occupation of Palestinian land and a halt to support for oil-lubricated despots throughout the region . \nThose are also goals that unite an overwhelming majority of Muslims in the Middle East and elsewhere and give al-Qaida and its allies the chance to recruit and operate - in a way that their extreme religious conservatism or dreams of restoring the medieval caliphate never would . \nAs even Osama bin Laden asked in his US election-timed video : if it was western freedom al-Qaida hated , `` Why do we not strike Sweden ? '' \nThe second disinformation line peddled by government supporters since last week 's bombings is that the London attacks had nothing to do with Iraq . \nThe Labor MP Tony Wright insisted that such an idea was `` not only nonsense , but dangerous nonsense '' . \nBlair has argued that , since the 9\\/11 attacks predated the Iraq war , outrage at the aggression could not have been the trigger . \nIt 's perfectly true that Muslim anger over Palestine , western-backed dictatorships and the aftermath of the 1991 war against Iraq - US troops in Arabia and a murderous sanctions regime against Iraq - was already intense before 2001 and fuelled al-Qaida 's campaign in the 1990s . \nBut that was aimed at the US , not Britain , which only became a target when Blair backed Bush 's war on terror . \nAfghanistan made a terror attack on Britain a likelihood ; Iraq made it a certainty . \nWe ca n't of course be sure of the exact balance of motivations that drove four young suicide bombers to strike last Thursday , but we can be certain that the bloodbath unleashed by Bush and Blair in Iraq - where a 7\\/7 takes place every day - was at the very least one of them . \nWhat they did was not `` home grown '' , but driven by a worldwide anger at US-led domination and occupation of Muslim countries . \nThe London bombers were to blame for attacks on civilians that are neither morally nor politically defensible . \nBut the prime minister - who was warned by British intelligence of the risks in the run-up to the war - is also responsible for knowingly putting his own people at risk in the service of a foreign power . \nThe security crackdowns and campaign to uproot an `` evil ideology '' the government announced yesterday will not extinguish the threat . \nOnly a British commitment to end its role in the bloody occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan is likely to do that . \n"}
{"id": "22", "time": "2005-07-14", "text": "Thursday 14 July 2005 00.03 BST In the West Bank and Gaza , portraits of dead suicide bombers and graffiti extolling their deeds are plastered all over walls . \nVideos of their last interviews are on sale on street stalls . \nTheir funerals are occasions for mass mourning . \nThat celebrity factor helps in the recruitment of suicide bombers , young men and women brought up in the occupied territories . \nAnne Marie Oliver , an American academic who has spent years studying the phenomenon in the West Bank and Gaza , believes the `` star factor '' and the acquiring of glory could also have motivated the Yorkshire bombers . \nThey will not have posters up in Britain or mass mourning , but they will attain glory on internet sites across the Muslim world , according to Ms Oliver , who has co-written with Paul Steinberg the newly published The Road to Martyrs ' Square : A Journey into the World of the Suicide Bomber . \n`` It does not matter whether it is Britain or Syria or the West Bank , they are highly romantic figures , '' she said . \nThe fact that they carried with them credit cards and other personal ID suggests they wanted to be known . \nThe British media has , in the main , demonised the Yorkshire bombers in much the same way as the IRA was in the 1980s and 1990s . \nThe adjectives come readily : fanatics , mad , evil . \nMs Oliver does not believe suicide bombing is a brave act , but , she says , `` I steer away from the rubric of evil . \nYou have to develop a concept of the suicide bomber without either of these extremes '' . \nSuicide bombings , which have their origins in medieval times , can be traced through Japan 's kamikaze pilots to the Iranians during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war , and to the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka . \nThe modern version was developed by Hizbollah and its predecessor during the Lebanese civil war , with attacks on the US and then Israelis , and was refined by the Palestinians in 1994-96 and in the second intifada , beginning in 2000 . \nThe number of suicide bombings has increased in the past five years , a combination of the Palestinian attacks and those in Iraq , where the numbers now outstrip those in Israel . \nMs Oliver said : `` The motives are diverse : religion , nationalism , grievance , fame , glory and money , and , last of all and most important of all , they have to have an entire system that supports their actions -LRB- sympathetic groups round the world -RRB- . '' \nShe said the Yorkshire bombers would not necessarily have needed outside help from al-Qaida and could have gained all the knowledge , including practical advice , they needed from the internet . \nBoaz Ganor , head of the International Policy Institute for Counter-Terrorism in Herzliya , Israel , disagreed , saying that suicide bombers needed experienced handlers to provide explosives and choose targets . \nHis view is that all suicide attacks worldwide are organised by movements . \n`` If one wants to understand the phenomenon , do not understand the motivation of the perpetrator but the motivation of the organization , '' he said . \nFor organizations , whether Hamas or al-Qaida , the motivation was the same : the suicide bomber is the most effective weapon available . \n`` The suicide bomber is the smartest of smart bombs . \nHe can look around and decide when he can maximize the terror , maximize the casualties , '' Dr Ganor said . \nEven if he is caught , he or she can detonate the explosives , killing those trying to intervene . \nThe figures bear out Dr Ganor 's assessment . \nAccording to Israel , it has faced 160 suicide bombers in the last five years : they account for only 0.6 % of the attacks but half the Israeli casualties - 514 . \nThe movements lock the recruits in , in part through the recording of the final videos for release after the bombing . \nAmong Palestinians , a further factor , one that does not apply in Yorkshire , is poverty . \nThe suicide bomber knows his family will be cared for after his death by various Arab charities and will often be better off than before . \nThe family will also enjoy greater prestige . \nMost of the bombers tend to be young , well-educated , and from lower middle-class backgrounds rather than those fighting for daily survival . \nAn Israeli government study found that 23 % of suicide bombers between 2000 and this year had been university graduates . \nTheir families , like those in Yorkshire , were often unaware of their intentions . \nDr Ganor said that religion was the predominant motive . \n`` He believes he is carrying out God 's will . \nThey do not call it a suicide but shuada , martyrdom . \nThey believe they do not die : they just transfer from life to heaven , a one-way ticket . \nAnd they believe there will be 72 virgins that serve them . '' \nBut religion is not the sole explanation . \nThe Tamil Tigers were just as eager for self-sacrifice but were not motivated by religion . \nIt was a matter of revenge , a way for the powerless to fight back , to create fear . \nThere is a desire among jihadists for revenge over what is seen as the brutal treatment of fellow Muslims : Russia 's suppression of Chechnya , the Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank , and the US and British role in Iraq . \nToby Dodge , one of Britain 's leading academics specialising on Iraq , said that Iraq has had a bigger impact on British Muslims than Chechnya or the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . \n`` How Iraq is different is that Americans and British are killing Muslims . \nIf you are a radical imam trying to mobilise a set of poorly integrated Yorkshire youths of Pakistani origin , it is a much more potent message to say the Americans and British are killing Muslims , '' Dr Dodge said . \nMs Oliver said that one of the most important motivating factors was what she described as `` an element of ecstatic camaraderie , which is central to the group '' . \nShe believed the Yorkshire bombers shared the happiness of camaraderie . \n`` The people we studied , a Hamas cell , described their time before their death as the happiest day of their life . \nWhat I have read of the London bombings , police officers described the three guys on CCTV as looking as if they were going on holiday , '' she said . \n"}
{"id": "194", "time": "2005-07-14", "text": "Thursday 14 July 2005 11.13 BST Terror came to the doorstep of King 's College London last week - one variant of modern warfare that its department of war studies has been researching and teaching about for more than three decades . \nFor many of those struggling to understand the conflicts that are rocking the world , one path has been to the Strand where the department has offices that look like a bunker below street level , under the command of Sir Lawrence Freedman , official historian of the Falklands campaign . \nIts postgraduate students have been drawn from far and wide . \nNow King 's is taking its war degree to the world , launching an e-learning masters , War in the Modern World , for which , from September , it hopes to have 70 students signed up around the globe . \nThis expeditionary move has been more than three years in the planning and involved writing a completely new degree , suited to the internet , says Anne-Lucie Norton , director of the e-learning program . \nThe possibilities for the use of pictures , maps and video material are obvious - and using the net students will role-play the Cuban missile crisis . \n-LRB- They came very close to nuclear war in the pilot earlier this year , apparently . -RRB- \nThere is archive footage of Kennedy 's `` Ich bin ein Berliner '' speech from the height of the cold war , for instance , as well as of more recent wars . \nBut Ms Norton points out that the academic rigor of the degree , its entry standards and the assessment by essays are all pretty traditional . \nThe point of e-learning is not the technology : `` It 's the learning , stupid , '' she says . \nThere have been academic casualties in previous e-learning campaigns , including Fathom , an e-learning portal created by the London School of Economics and Columbia University in the US . \nThe most spectacular defeat was perhaps UKeU , the British e-university , which spent # 50m of taxpayers ' money to recruit 900 students and still could not get its technology to work before the funding council closed it down . \nThe war studies e-degree was originally going to be delivered by UKeU and that debacle delayed the King 's launch by about a year , Ms Norton reckons , but she is confident the ground for this new learning exercise has been well reconnoitred , the academic ammunition is tried and tested and , above all , that the mission is clear to go . \nCore modules cover contemporary warfare from 1945 to the present day , including a unit on the `` war on terror '' and its prospects . \nA web-CT e-learning platform links students to tutors and the King 's College library - and to each other in chatrooms designed to foster an online community of interest and to stimulate discussion . \nSome of the discussion promises to be passionate - Israel and Palestine and the Iraq wars , for instance . \nMore than 600 people have registered an interest in the e-learning degree over the past couple of years as it has been prepared , and there is an established international audience for King 's war studies degrees among people working in the government and non-governmental organizations as well as the services and the defense industries . \nBut the college now has to convert that interest into paying customers - who would have to part with # 12,000 for the MA taken part-time over three years and # 10,500 for a diploma . \nNot at all , they 're changing lives , says @NUS_Liam -LRB- who knew he used to be a scout ? -RRB- \n"}
{"id": "283", "time": "2005-07-13", "text": "On Monday , Marie Fatayi-Williams stood near Tavistock Square , where her son Anthony is feared to have been killed in last week 's bus bombing , and delivered a lament of extraordinary power for her lost son . \nTim Collins , the British army colonel who himself gave a historic speech on the eve of the Iraq war , says such genuine emotion is rarely forgotten Caught in the spotlight of history , set on the stage of a very public event , Marie Fatayi-Williams , the mother of Anthony Fatayi-Williams , 26 and missing since Thursday , appeals for news of her son . \nHer words are a mixture of stirring rhetoric , heartfelt appeal and a stateswoman-like vision , and so speak on many levels to the nation and the world . \nHer appeal is a simple one - where is my son ? \nIf he has been killed , then why ? \nMarie has found herself , as I did on the eve of the invasion of Iraq , an unwitting voice , speaking amid momentous events . \nHer appeal , delivered on Monday not far from Tavistock Square , where she fears her son died in the bomb attack on the number 30 bus , gives a verbal form to the whirlpool of emotions that have engulfed society as the result of last week 's bombings . \nI suspect Marie , like myself , had no idea that her words would find such wide recognition , have fed such an acute hunger for explanation , have slaked such a thirst for expression of the sheer horror of Thursday 's events . \nThis kind of speech is normally the preserve of the great orators , statesmen and playwrights , of Shakespeare , Churchill or Lincoln . \nIt is often a single speech , a soliloquy or address from the steps of the gallows , that explains , inspires , exhorts and challenges . \nBut always such addresses are crafted for effect and consciously intended to sway and influence , and often , as in the case of Shakespeare 's Henry V , they are set in the mouth of a long dead hero or delivered by wordsmiths who are masters of their craft . \nIt is rare in history that such oratory is the genuine article , springing from the heart and bursting forth to an unwitting audience . \nIn Marie 's case , her speech gains its power as a vehicle of grief and loss , and of the angst of a mother who yearns for her beloved son . \nIn my case it was the opposite emotion from which I drew inspiration - an appeal to understand , to empathise , to give courage and purpose . \nI was motivated by a need to warn and teach as well as to encourage . \nMarie 's motivation is a reflection on loss and that most powerful of all emotions , a mother 's love . \nThe form the address takes is as poignant as the language used . \nThere is an initial explanation of the extraordinary circumstances of the loss , a cri de coeur for the innocent blood lost , a rejection of the act by its comparison to the great liberators , and the assertion that her loss is all our loss in the family of humanity . \nIt ends with her personal grief for her flesh and blood , her hopes and pride . \nThe language echoes verses of the Bible as well as from the Koran . \nIt has raw passion as well as heart-rending pathos . \nWith only a photograph of her son and a sheet of paper as a prompt , Marie 's words burst out with as much emotion as anger . \nHer speech stands in stark contrast to the pronouncements of politicians , prepared by aides and delivered from copious notes . \nIt is indeed the raw originality and authentic angst that give the delivery such impact , the plea such effect . \nNo knighted veteran of the Royal Shakespeare Company could deliver such an address without hours or even days of rehearsal . \nI know from my own experience that only momentous events can provoke such a moment , only raw emotion can inspire such a spontaneous plea . \nI am often asked how long it took me to write my speech , delivered to my regiment , the Royal Irish , on the eve of the invasion of Iraq on March 19 2003 at Fort Blair Mayne camp in the Kuwaiti desert . \nMy answer is simple - not one moment . \nThere was no plan ; I spoke without notes . \nFor me there was only the looming spectre of actual warfare and the certainty of loss and killing , and I was speaking to myself as well as to my men . \nI suspect for Marie there was only the yawning black void of loss , the cavern left behind in her life caused by the loss of a son who can never be replaced . \nWhat , then , can we take from this ? \nMarie 's appeal is important as it is momentous . \nHer words are as free from hatred as they are free from self-interest ; it is clear that no man can give her her heart 's desire - her son . \nI was also struck by the quiet dignity of her words , the clarity of her view and the weight of her convictions . \nShe does not condemn , she appeals ; her words act as an indictment of all war and violence , not just acts of terror but also the unnecessary aggression of nation states . \nHer message is simple : here is a human who only wanted to give , to succeed and to make his mother proud . \nWhere is the victory in his death ? \nWhere is the progress in his destruction ? \nIn her own words : `` What inspiration can senseless slaughter provide ? '' \nI am certain that Marie 's appeal will go down as one of the great speeches of our new century . \nIt will give comfort to the families and friends of the dead and injured , both of this act and no doubt , regrettably , of events still to come . \nIt should act as a caution to statesmen and leaders , a focus for public grief and , ultimately , as a challenge to , as well as a condemnation of , the perpetrators . \nMarie is already an icon of the loss of Thursday July 7 . \nHaving traveled from Africa to find a better life , Anthony Fatayi-Williams carried the hopes and pride of his family . \nNow , as his mother has traveled to London , arguably one of the most cosmopolitan and integrated cities in the world , and standing nearby a wrecked icon of that city , a red double-decker bus , she has made an appeal which is as haunting as it is relevant , as poignant as it is appealing . \nIt is a fact that such oratory as both Marie and I produced is born of momentous events , and inspired by hope and fears in equal measure . \nBut Marie 's appeal is also important on another level . \nI have long urged soldiers in conflict zones to keep communicating with the population in order to be seen as people - it is easier to kill uniforms than it is to kill people . \nOn July 7 the suicide bombers attacked icons of a society that they hated more than they loved life , the red London bus and the tube . \nMarie 's speech has stressed the real victims ' identities . \nThey are all of us . \n`` This is Anthony , Anthony Fatayi - Williams , 26 years old , he 's missing and we fear that he was in the bus explosion ... on Thursday . \nWe do n't know . \nWe do know from the witnesses that he left the Northern line in Euston . \nWe know he made a call to his office at Amec at 9.41 from the NW1 area to say he could not make -LRB- it -RRB- by the tube but he would find alternative means to work . \nSince then he has not made any contact with any single person . \nNow New York , now Madrid , now London . \nThere has been widespread slaughter of innocent people . \nThere have been streams of tears , innocent tears . \nThere have been rivers of blood , innocent blood . \nDeath in the morning , people going to find their livelihood , death in the noontime on the highways and streets . \nThey are not warriors . \nWhich cause has been served ? \nCertainly not the cause of God , not the cause of Allah because God Almighty only gives life and is full of mercy . \nAnyone who has been misled , or is being misled to believe that by killing innocent people he or she is serving God should think again because it 's not true . \nTerrorism is not the way , terrorism is not the way . \nIt does n't beget peace . \nWe ca n't deliver peace by terrorism , never can we deliver peace by killing people . \nThroughout history , those people who have changed the world have done so without violence , they have -LRB- won -RRB- people to their cause through peaceful protest . \nNelson Mandela , Martin Luther King , Mahatma Gandhi , their discipline , their self-sacrifice , their conviction made people turn towards them , to follow them . \nWhat inspiration can senseless slaughter provide ? \nDeath and destruction of young people in their prime as well as old and helpless can never be the foundations for building society . \nMy son Anthony is my first son , my only son , the head of my family . \nIn African society , we hold on to sons . \nHe has dreams and hopes and I , his mother , must fight to protect them . \nThis is now the fifth day , five days on , and we are waiting to know what happened to him and I , his mother , I need to know what happened to Anthony . \nHis young sisters need to know what happened , his uncles and aunties need to know what happened to Anthony , his father needs to know what happened to Anthony . \nMillions of my friends back home in Nigeria need to know what happened to Anthony . \nHis friends surrounding me here , who have put this together , need to know what has happened to Anthony . \nI need to know , I want to protect him . \nI 'm his mother , I will fight till I die to protect him . \nTo protect his values and to protect his memory . \nInnocent blood will always cry to God Almighty for reparation . \nHow much blood must be spilled ? \nHow many tears shall we cry ? \nHow many mothers ' hearts must be maimed ? \nMy heart is maimed . \nI pray I will see my son , Anthony . \nI need to know , Anthony needs to know , Anthony needs to know , so do many others unaccounted for innocent victims , they need to know . \nIt 's time to stop and think . \nWe can not live in fear because we are surrounded by hatred . \nLook around us today . \nAnthony is a Nigerian , born in London , worked in London , he is a world citizen . \nHere today we have Christians , Muslims , Jews , Sikhs , Hindus , all of us united in love for Anthony . \nHatred begets only hatred . \nIt is time to stop this vicious cycle of killing . \nWe must all stand together , for our common humanity . \nI need to know what happened to my Anthony . \nHe 's the love of my life . \nMy first son , my first son , 26 . \nHe tells me one day , `` Mummy , I do n't want to die , I do n't want to die . \nI want to live , I want to take care of you , I will do great things for you , I will look after you , you will see what I will achieve for you . \nI will make you happy .

'' \n`` Since this government came to power the people of Sedgefield have been subjected to an increased tax burden of 60 % . \n`` Mr Blair promised to cut crime , improve school standards and not to raise taxes but he has failed to deliver . \nThe people of Sedgefield have a unique opportunity to send a signal to Mr Blair at the next election . \n`` Seven years of failing to deliver on his promises is long enough . \nIt 's time for him to go . '' \nMr Blair 's agent , John Burton , responded today : `` The Tories can change their candidate but they can not change their policies , they are still going to cut # 35bn from the public services budget . '' \nMr Shayler and Mr Keys are expected to meet soon to see if one is willing to drop out to leave just one anti-war candidate . \nMr Shayler said earlier he intended to challenge the prime minister on the `` illegal '' invasion of Iraq . \nMr Keys , whose son , Lance Corporal Tom Keys , was one of six Red Caps killed by a mob in a small police station in Al Majar Al Kabir in June 2003 , also intends to bring Iraq to the forefront of the election , and said he wanted `` justice '' for his son . \nMeanwhile , in the national election battle , Labor 's election chief , Alan Milbur , n accused Michael Howard of drafting in a `` dodgy '' Australian aide . \nMark Textor , an Australian colleague of the controversial Tory strategist Lynton Crosby , is expected to arrive in the UK in time for the start of the official election campaign . \nMr Textor has been accused of using `` push polling '' in Australia , where telephone canvassing is used to camouflage disseminating misinformation about the opposition . \nMr Milburn addressed what he termed the `` Australian question '' at a Labor press conference . \n`` Mr Howard 's campaign is being run by an Australian . \nAnother Australian is about to arrive , someone who has a pretty dodgy track record and reputation . '' \nThe pair were a `` fly-by-night operation '' he said , and Mr Howard was `` flitting from issue to issue , enhancing his reputation as a serial opportunist '' , he added . \nA Tory spokesman accused Mr Milburn of attempting to `` divert attention '' from campaign issues . \n`` Lynton Crosby and Mark Textor are both very talented campaigners , '' he said . \nMr Milburn 's deputy , Fraser Kemp , raised the issue yesterday but a Conservative spokesman stressed : `` They did not do it . '' \nThe spokesman added : `` We would never do it here . '' \n"}
{"id": "338", "time": "2005-04-02", "text": "No home fit for heroes Around 130,000 veterans of the Iraqi conflict have already returned to the US . \nFor some , all that awaits is a life of virtual destitution . \nSo far , the numbers are small , but the fear is that they are just the start of a chronic problem that America will be dealing with for years to come . \nGary Younge reports Like Martin Luther King , Herold Noel had a dream that was `` deeply rooted in the American dream '' . \nIt did not involve anything as lofty as racial harmony or the brotherhood of man . \nHerold was after something far more basic . \n`` I wanted to have a white house with a picket fence , without drugs and all that , '' he says . \n`` That was my dream . \nI grew up in the ghetto , and in the ghetto you will see a 10-year-old smoking weed . \nThat 's what I was raised around , and I wanted a better life for me and my kids . \nI did n't want to be like Puffy and pour $ 1,000 bottles of Cristal on the floor . \nI just wanted to throw a barbecue in my own backyard . '' \nSo Herold joined the army . \n`` The army offered me a better life , '' he says . \nIt was his passport out of the ghetto . \nHe signed up in September 2000 , `` to check it out '' . \n`` I did n't really expect to be in a war before I joined , but when Bush came to office , I knew there would be one . '' \nSure enough , in January 2003 , Herold went to the Middle East and eventually to Iraq , where he worked as a fuel handler . \nHe did n't think much of the politics involved in his mission . \n`` I let the politicians handle that . '' \nTo the extent that he did think about it , his views did not go beyond basic revenge for the terrorist attacks of September 11 . \n`` My views were , we 're fighting for our country , because they 're bombing our country . \nWe 're going to go and fuck these guys up , because they fucked up our country . \nI was fighting for our freedom . '' \nBut in August 2003 , Herold returned to the US to find the personal dream he had been struggling for more elusive than ever . \nHerold had gone abroad to fight for his country and came back to find he was homeless . \nFirst he went to shelters , but he had his war medals stolen and felt harassed . \nBy the middle of January , the 25-year-old father of four found a place to sleep not behind a white picket fence but in the back of his red 1994 Jeep Cherokee . \nHe had sent three of his children to live with their grandmother in Florida . \nMeanwhile , his wife and toddler son were poised to join him in the car . \nThe sister-in-law with whom they had been staying was about to move to a smaller apartment . \n`` Now I 'm fighting a different kind of war , but it 's still a war for survival , '' Herold says . \nTwo years into the war in Iraq , and a growing number of isolated cases such as Herold 's have emerged of US veterans from the war on terror returning home to a life of virtual destitution . \nSo far , the numbers are small . \nA couple of dozen unemployed veterans enrolling in a job-training program at a New England shelter for homeless veterans ; three men seeking help in Ohio ; a handful showing up in a survey in Minnesota ; 30 looking for assistance at the Black Veterans for Social Justice Centre in Brooklyn . \nAccording to the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans , the total is 67 nationwide . \nThat figure amounts to a small fraction of the 130,000 who have already served and come home . \nAnd yet those who work with homeless veterans already see this as a terrible sign . \n`` We fear that we are going to see this big wave , '' says Linda Boone , director of the National Coalition For Homeless Veterans . \n`` It 's too early for that yet , but it could happen . \nPeople have these yellow ribbons saying Support The Troops . \nThey support them when they 're in the war , but it 's when they take off the uniform that things get bad . '' \nNicole Goodwin , 24 , found herself shuttling her one-year-old daughter Shylah between New York 's homeless shelters last year after she returned from Iraq . \n`` I thought my story was one in a million , '' she says . \n`` But it 's not . \nThere are around 40 in New York alone ; we 're pushing for a congressional hearing . '' \nDan Louhous , director of Special Projects Veterans Affairs at Ohio Valley Goodwill , says the worst is yet to come . \n`` It has n't been dramatic up to this point , because it 's just beginning . \nWe have n't learned a damned thing since Vietnam . '' \n`` A true war story is never moral , '' wrote Tim O'Brien in The Things They Carried , his book about Vietnam . \n`` If at the end of a war story you feel uplifted , or if you feel that some small bit of rectitude has been salvaged from the larger waste , then you have been made the victim of a very old and terrible lie ... You can tell a true war story by the way it never seems to end . \nNot then , not ever . '' \nHerold describes his experience in Iraq as `` a living hell '' that shows little sign of ending . \n`` We saw dead bodies everywhere . \nPeople walked over dead bodies like they were n't there . \nWomen and children played with AK-47s . \nWhen you see a crowd in Iraq , you know that something bad 's going to happen when the sun goes down . '' \nMore than once , something bad nearly did happen to Herold . \nOne time , he was filling a fuel tank when he came under fire . \nThe tank fell on its side . \nIt would have taken one good shot to pierce the tank and blow him up . \n`` I could n't see anything . \nOne of the other soldiers broke my window and got me out of there . \nI thought I was n't going to see my kids or nothing . \nI went through all that . \nI got religious over there . \nI thought somebody 's got to be looking out for me . '' \nNow Herold finds riding the subway difficult because he ca n't be around a lot of people . \n`` I was a happy-go-lucky person . \nNow I 'm angry and agitated . \nI get angry quick . \nI have bad dreams . \nI started hearing kids crying . \nI hear a lot of screaming , like there 's a riot going on . '' \nVietnam hangs heavy on the American psyche . \nIt is the moral weight against which any military adventure is measured : a flexible fable used as often by those who support war as by those who oppose it . \nMilitary veterans comprise 9 % of the overall population and 23 % of the homeless . \nMost of those are from the Vietnam era , but on average they did not become homeless until they had been back home from Vietnam for between nine and 12 years . \nThat was how long it often took for the mental health problems to take their toll in the loss of family , job and home . \nIt is also why providers of services believe the early trickle of homeless veterans from the Iraq war could presage something far more dramatic . \nThe legacy of Vietnam shapes the public response to troops and veterans . \nConscious that conscripted soldiers paid the price for a political mistake 35 years ago , Americans hold the troops sacrosanct - and this regardless of their politics . \nThe nation is split over the war in Iraq , but the metallic yellow ribbons saying Support The Troops give no indication of whether a person is for or against the war . \nWhen Herold and Nicole 's stories became public last year , the response was breathtaking . \nNew York Times readers offered Nicole rooms in their homes , baby supplies and pledges of more than $ 17,000 . \nA woman in California sent a cheque for $ 10 , to be used for `` a better life '' ; an anonymous donor sent a cheque for $ 1,000 , with a note that said , `` You risked your life in Iraq for your country ... for all of us . '' \nNicole was also offered a $ 12-an-hour job by a community housing company , which she took so that she could rent a one-room apartment in Harlem from the Coalition for the Homeless . \nWhen Herold explained his situation on the radio , a caller offered him a job - he declined , saying that campaigning for veterans ' housing is his job . \nA couple of weeks later , Herold was given $ 18,500 and an apartment in the Bronx big enough to reunite his family . \nSo long as the homeless veterans are few , such kindness from strangers is possible . \nBut a recent study published by the New England Journal of Medicine found that 15 % -17 % of veterans from Iraq meet `` the screening criteria for major depression , generalised anxiety or PTSD '' . \nOf those , just 23 % -40 % are looking for help . \nAdd mental illness to poor education and poverty , and many returning vets find themselves , like most of America 's working poor , just one routine mishap away from destitution - medical bills for an unexpected illness , an inescapable repair to a house or harsh weather blocking your way to work . \nIn Herold 's case , he was living in Georgia waiting to re-enlist in the army when his car engine blew up . \nLiving in a place where you needed a car to get around , Herold had a tough choice : `` It cost $ 2,500 to mend it , and I did n't have no $ 2,500 . \nSo it was either pay rent or get the car fixed . \nI had to pay the rent , but then we both lost our jobs because we did n't have a car . \nThat 's how come I came to New York with no job and no home . '' \nLike Herold , Nicole has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder . \nLike Herold , she has yet to receive any state benefits . \nNicole , who went to the same high school as former secretary of state Colin Powell , became homeless last year after she fell out with her mother . \nGiven the living conditions , it was not surprising . \nShe came back from Iraq to a two-bedroom flat in the projects that served as home to her mother , her two sisters , a four-year old nephew , Nicole and her daughter Shylah . \nIt took a week for the situation to deteriorate to the point where she and her mother could not share the same roof . \n`` It was n't any one thing , '' she says . \n`` Just the same old same old . '' \nAfter a spell in shelters , she now has a place in Harlem . \nWhen I arrived , Nicole apologised for the mess . \nA smart young woman with plans to go to university and study political science and journalism , Nicole 's outlook on life is generally upbeat . \n`` They throw you a lot of lemons and you have to make lemonade , '' she says . \nBut since her return , she 's had trouble sleeping and is struggling to cope . \nSometimes she feels numb . \nWalking down the street with Shylah recently , she almost got hit by a car . \n`` I felt nothing , '' she says . \n`` The only thought in my head was that people die every day . \nIn Iraq , there were so many situations that you could n't help that I just got used to feeling that way . \nThe worst thing was n't the war , it was coming back , because nobody understood why I was the way I was . '' \nThe government body that is supposed to deal with these issues is the Veterans ' Association . \nBut the VA is hopelessly overstretched , capable of helping just 100,000 of the 500,000 homeless veterans each year . \nAnd they can hope for little improvement . \nRecently the Bush administration offered generous benefits to those who died in battle , including an increase from $ 12,420 to $ 100,000 to the families of fallen soldiers , plus an extra $ 150,000 in life insurance . \nBut for the living there were cuts in the number of nursing care beds and plans to charge wealthier veterans with non-service related problems an annual fee and double their prescription payments . \n`` Congress has gone too far in expanding military retiree benefits , '' David Chu , a defense under - secretary , told the Wall Street Journal in February . \nHe went on to say the growth in veterans ' benefits was `` starting to crowd out two things : first , our ability to reward the person who is bearing the burden right now in Iraq or Afghanistan ... -LRB- second -RRB- we are undercutting our ability to finance the new gear that is going to make that military person successful , five , 10 , 15 years from now . '' \nIt 's an analysis that conflicts with the way Americans like to think about themselves . \nAmerica 's Promise is a standard history textbook , used by many of the nation 's high-school students , which tells the story of the country from the ice age to the present day . \nAt the end of 690 pages detailing , among other things , the genocide of the native Americans , slavery , segregation , Vietnam , Watergate , the final paragraph reads : `` The history of the United States is one of challenges faced , problems resolved and crises overcome . \nThroughout their history Americans have remained an optimistic people , carrying this optimism into the new century . \nThe full promise of America has yet to be realized . \nThis is the real promise of America ; the ability to dream of a better world to come . '' \nIt is difficult to overstress just how deeply ingrained this belief goes . \nThe US is the only country in the world where -LRB- apart from a few years in the mid-1970s -RRB- people consistently believe that the next year will be better than the current one . \nTo many US citizens , America is synonymous with `` freedom '' , `` democracy '' and `` opportunity '' . \nThese are the ideals that many believe the nation is exporting to the Middle East in the present war ; they are also the ideals that many believe they are defending at home . \nNicole and Herold were no different . \nAs they talk about why they went to war and what they think of it now , they will waver between nationalistic pride and disappointment . \nPride in what they believe America should be ; disappointment in what it has actually been for them . \nBoth volunteered for the army for their own particular reasons , but they were , in essence , conscripted by poverty . \n`` I did it to get away from all the negativity in my life , '' says Nicole . \n`` I did n't think I was going to get involved in a war . \nI did n't have a sense of direction and I thought the army would give me that . '' \nNicole is part of a trend that has seen a huge increase in minority women serving in the US army in noncombat roles . \nBlack women , who comprise only 16 % of the civilian population , now outnumber white in the army . \n`` A survey of the American military 's endlessly compiled and analyzed demographics paints a picture of a fighting force that is anything but a cross-section of America , '' wrote the New York Times last year . \n`` With minorities over-represented and the wealthy and the underclass essentially absent . '' \nBoth Herold and Nicole say they could not dwell on the rights or wrongs of this particular war . \nThey were soldiers and this was their job . \nBut events over the past few years have forced them to rethink . \n`` There 's not a day goes by that I do n't ask myself what was I fighting for , '' says Nicole . \n`` There were no WMD . \nWe were lied to , and it hurts me to think I went there for somebody 's lie . '' \nHerold thinks the war was primarily about money . \n`` I thought I was fighting for a better world , '' he says . \n`` I thought I was fighting so my kids and maybe their kids could go to Iraq on vacation if they wanted to . \nBut if you 're fighting this war for your own personal gain , that 's another thing . \nIf you 're fighting for world peace , then I agree with it . \nIt looks like we 're fighting for somebody else 's pocket . \nSo that Halliburton can get rich . '' \nYet neither the meager opportunities that forced them to join the army nor the dire conditions of their return can undermine their investment in the very American dream that progress and individual success are , if not inevitable , then universally possible . \n`` I saw Jay-Z -LRB- the rap star -RRB- going to these beautiful places , and I believe that if Jay-Z could come out of the ghetto , then I could come out of the ghetto , '' says Herold . \n`` The ideals of this country are that anybody could come back to America and make a better life for yourself . \nIt 's a land of opportunity . \nIn this country alone , if you put forth the effort , you can bear fruit . '' \nSquaring these mantras with their material conditions , however , is becoming increasingly difficult . \nThey are caught between a need to believe in America 's Promise and the realisation that in some way it has failed to deliver . \nAbandoned by institutional indifference , but rescued by individual generosity , they remain intensely patriotic , though their understanding of what that means has shifted subtly . \n`` I was fighting for freedom for the Iraqi people , '' says Herold , '' but I never had that decent life myself . '' \n`` I think it 's ironic that I could go and fight for freedom abroad and can not find this kind of freedom in my own city , '' says Nicole . \n`` What America thinks of as freedom and what I think of as freedom are two different things . \nI want to get a house , day care and go to school . \nMy freedoms are small . \nBut I ca n't give up , '' she adds . \n`` That 's what I learned when I was getting shot at - if millions of Iraqis could n't stop me , my own country 's not going to stop me .

{"id": "134", "time": "2005-04-02", "text": "In tomorrow 's paper David Aaronovitch has written a bumper comment piece . \nThe Editor thinks it might touch a few nerves - David 's stuff often does . \nSo we thought we 'd serve it up a bit early on the blog , let our most devoted readers get their hands on it first . \nIt 's polemic dynamite . \nThe page has gone now , although we ca n't rule out some late edition changes . \nIt 's been a marathon day . \nThe spring sunshine has passed us by . \nTime for a pint and a good rant . \nOver to you David ... The saloon-bar right-winger with his received wisdoms is a familiar demon . \nHe and his friends sit , nursing their drinks , and construct a perfect and consistent image of the modern world . \nThere are too many immigrants . \nCriminality goes unpunished while law-abiding citizens are victimised . \nHard-working people are penalized by high taxes that go to pay for no-hopers to study Mickey Mouse courses at former polytechnics . \nIt s all going to the dogs . \nMeanwhile , in shuttered dining-rooms in Holland Park , Highbury and Kennington , in converted barns in Herefordshire and flagged kitchens in Brittany , in the pages of the London Review of Books and at publishing parties , the British intelligentsia collectively creates , reproduces and conforms to its own , narrow narrative of what is happening on the planet . \nAs reported or argued in articles , reviews , interviews or diaries , this story includes the following necessary elements : Labor would have won in 1997 anyway without Tony Blair ; Labor are now pretty much the same as the Tories , that s why there is so much apathy ; Blair has no social vision , he just wants power for its own sake ; new Labor is in hock to America for strange psychological reasons to do with power and weaponry ; Labor wishes to privatise the public services ; Labor hasn t achieved anything of any note ; Labor represents a unique threat to our ancient liberties ; Blair is a pious , lying hypocritical warmonger ; he is trying to scare us unnecessarily ; there is no such thing as a terrorist threat or if there is such a thing , then it s no worse than when the IRA was active , or if it is worse , then it s the consequence of Western arrogance and globalisation . \nThis orthodoxy , I would argue , has become in its own etiolated way as stifling as anything imposed on the faithful by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith . \nThere are people who never meet people who think anything other than the things I ve listed above , yet their influence on debate in this country is out of all proportion either to their numbers or their political understanding . \nInactive themselves , they spread hopelessness and cynicism and help pave the way for a return of the right , a return that many of them would unconsciously perhaps welcome . \nThe proximate cause for my rage is an article in this edition of the London Review of Books by the novelist John Lanchester . \nEntitled What is Labor for ? \n, the piece is ostensibly a review of Stephen Pollard s biography of David Blunkett , but is in fact the magazine s election campaign curtain-raiser . \nAnd the temper of the argument is immediately apparent . \nThe party s record in government , writes Lanchester , evokes a range of responses on the left from mild gloom to clinical depression , from irritation to rage , from apathy to horror . \nThere it is , at once the annihilation of other possibilities . \nLanchester is saying that there is no section of the left that feels -LRB- or can feel -RRB- more positively about the government than irritated or apathetic . \nThat must be the best you can do , and still be on the left . \nNever mind enthusiastic ; even broadly supportive is simply not an option . \nThen comes the list . \nWar , tuition fees , house arrest , wholesale subservience to American foreign policy , talk of services being swamped by refugees , the deliberately manipulative use of fear , the introduction of ID cards , the suspension of habeas corpus and these are the good guys . \nThe list , of course , is hugely partial and the description of each of the items within it is carefully slanted . \nNot necessarily wrong by the way , but artfully constructed Lanchester is a writer I admire and the LRB is well-edited . \nAnd the piece represents probably the most coherent and literary dinner-party critique of New Labor that you are likely to find . \nBut , my God , you ll find plenty . \nLet s begin with existential disgust . \nBen Ramm , editor of the new magazine The Liberal -LRB- for which I ve written myself -RRB- expresses the mood well when , in his latest editorial , he tells his readers that , Few administrations have governed as prosaically as the incumbent Labor one , or with as little imagination , ideology and sincerity . \nUnfortunately the comparison is generalised , so we don t discover whether he prefers the lyricism of the Major government , the poetry of the poll tax , or the satisfyingly ideological drama of the miners strike . \nAnother nostrum is the dimness of Blair . \nDoris Lessing said it a year ago , the philosopher Ted Honderich said it again a fortnight ago . \nHe hates Blair because he is always asking to be judged by the morality of his intentions . \nHe does n't understand that no one cares about his fucking morality In any case , his morality is so muddy and ill-considered . \nI 'm increasingly coming to the opinion that Blair 's main problem is that he 's not very bright . \nHonderich , we were told by his interviewer , was the son of a Mennonite German father and a Scottish Calvinist mother . \nDim , and a philistine . \nLast week the director Richard Eyre , writing in the Guardian , described his reaction to a Labor official who described himself as being on the left . \nQuaint , is n't it , Eyre mocked , to hear a member of the present government describing themselves as being on the left ? \nMore plausibly , being on the left means taking issue with the government on the Iraq war , civil liberties and tuition fees . \nIt also means being indignant at the failure to demonstrate any sort of response to the arts , apart from indifference . \nIt is hard to beat those three sentences for smugness . \nCould left not even possibly encompass wanting to see a fascist dictatorship toppled , greater access to higher education for more students , or protection for citizens from terrorism ? \nAnd how indignant , exactly , does one have to be about any sort of response to the arts -LRB- ie , inevitably , more money -RRB- before one is permitted to be on the left ? \nI wanted to know what Eyre made of a recent study showing that Britons visit more plays , concerts , libraries , museums and art galleries than their counterparts in France , Germany or Italy . \nHow does it come about that , in a country run by philistine New Labor , you can just walk into the Tate , whereas the visitor to the Gare D Orsay in Paris must queue for an hour , even in the bitter cold , to pay a fortune to see the art on display ? \nIn dinner-party Britain it never happened . \nOne person who understands about this mental shut-out is the man I began this piece with , John Lanchester . \nIn the summer of 2003 Lanchester revealed his own run-ins with the bruschetta orthodoxies . \nAfter the 1997 election , Lanchester wrote : I very quickly felt as if I was the only person I knew who still basically approved of Blair , apart from all the people who voted for him . \nLanchester felt that much of the left s hatred of Blair was down to an inability to deal with power . \nSo Lanchester s most recent article represents a shift , and may seem all the more convincing for that . \nBut I wonder whether it isn t the society that Lanchester keeps which has eventually got to him . \nExhausted from defending the excoriated Blair , he has decided to join in the chorus of exaggerated disgust . \nHe sees , for instance , Blunkett s authoritarian tendencies , ignores any countervailing evidence -LRB- the more liberal stance on immigration , divorce , cohabitation , gay rights , cannabis etc. -RRB- , parcels together Belmarsh and Asbos , and refuses a discussion of what response would be appropriate to the possible threat from 9\\/11 or Madrid-type terrorism . \nLanchester has simply stopped saying but . \nLet s take Asbos . \nThey are problematic because they re new and could be abused . \nBut one quote from my local paper last week should show Lanchester why so many people support them . \nA resident of King s Cross , until recently a gigantic al fresco drugs mart , told a reporter : If you look at the difference where I live it is massive . \nTwo years ago people s doorways were constantly being used by drug dealers and users , but the problem has dried up . \nThe man felt , perhaps for the first time in years , that the law was on his side and protecting him . \nThe same applies to the government s mission . \nPerverse headlining hid one of last week s most encouraging stories . \nBuried in the tale about the small possible fall in household incomes , was the news about reductions in relative poverty . \nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies revealed that the incomes of the poorest people in Britain grew between 2003 and 2004 , partly because of new , more generous tax credits . \nThe incomes of the richest fifth of households fell by about 1 per cent , but the incomes of the poorest fifth rose by about 1 per cent . \nAs a result , overall , said the IFS the gap between Britain 's rich and poor shrank for the third successive year . \nChild poverty fell by 100,000 , less than the government target , but the fall may well be larger and the IFS thought that the government could still eventually meet its target . \nAt the same time , pensioner poverty continues to fall dramatically , dropping by a tenth in a single year -LRB- 2002\\/03 -RRB- , and by over a quarter since 1998\\/99 . \nThere is no NHS beds disaster , there is no teacher shortage -LRB- the Jamie Oliver phenomenon partly testifies to the lack of a crisis in other areas of school resources -RRB- , waiting lists are No , enough . \nI will not play this game . \nBecause however much money goes into public services , the Dinner Party is dissatisfied . \nIt is unhappy with targets which disrupt the autonomy of professionals , it is unhappy with any kind of private involvement , it is unhappy with any notion of choice . \nThe writer John Harris , in his comfortable chronicle of disillusion So Now Who Do We Vote For ?

'' \nIt was therefore the responsibility of the security council to determine if Iraq was in breach of 1441 . \nAs we now know , the faulty intelligence from Ahmed Chalabi and Allawi was kept from the real experts like Dr. Brian Jones who were excluded from the drafting of the second `` dossier '' by Alastair Campbell and the incompetent John Scarlett . \nFailures of judgement by CEOs should lead to their dismissal . \nI hope Tony Blair is duly dismissed in May . \nA hung parliament would be an ideal result , reflecting the true wishes of the electorate . \nPosted by Mark Webb on April 3 , 2005 02:13 PM . \nThe Editor is right that David Aaronovitch -LRB- DA -RRB- would touch a nerve . \nThe arguments are too polarised on both sides and allow for no element of truth in either side 's arguments when several exist . \nMay I first ask all activists -LRB- left -RRB- to read John Lanchester . \nI 'm an activist if stuffing leaflets in envelopes , coming up with local campaigning ideas at Labor Party meetings , and driving the Chairman of the Labor party from Hastings to Eastbourne on his pre election tour is activism . \nLabor Party activism these days is almost disenfranchised , unthinking ` doing ' . \nDebate , criticism and analysis of Labor 's failures and achievements nationally is not a strong point of ward meetings . \nCould I perhaps also ask if the Editor asked Lanchester and the LRB if the Observer could reprint the Lanchester piece ? \nIt would have been a useful counterpoint to D.A. 's piece . \nMy immediate reaction to Lanchester was that it was spot on . \nBut again it was polarised . \nThese people -LRB- Lessing , Lanchester et al -RRB- are not activists says D.A. Presumably not being activists implies they never were activists , and that all they have time for now is criticising from ivory -LRB- and chrome -RRB- kitchens and eating at subsequent dinner parties . \nBut the arguments marshalled by DA are thin -LRB- i.e. the riposte to Blunkett 's and therefore Blair 's authoritarianism is very weak . -RRB- \nDA is right about the left 's discomfort with ` power ' but why would n't they be , especially when it seems to be concentrated almost solely with the executive , rather than in parliament ? \nThe truth is , there is the left , and the middling left , and New Labor and the right . \nIt is a broad Church now . \nThe old left are heretics in the eyes of the Executive , suffered and useful only at general election time . \nHeresy it is now to demand democracy at home and in Zimbabwe . \nsay the leftists , if Iraq suffered in the name of Democracy then let principle demand we apply the same base rule to spread it everywhere including doing a beter job of it at home . \nBut I do n't believe democracy was the reason for the Iraq War , although a semblance of democracy is still a potential outcome , but at such a cost . \nNew Labor in opposition and the New Labor Government learned what Machiavelli taught his proteges , that power and the maintenance of power is the ultimate objective . \nIf maintaining power requires servicing some socialist ideals it will happen and has , to some degree . \nBut it also means servicing market ideologies . \nIt needs broad appeal to stay in power and hold the territory formerly claimed by those in power before it . \nYet I am troubled . \nI want New Labor to become a different Labor but shorn of Old Labor 's weaknesses and internal autocracies . \nI know that perceptions of doing something worthwhile to make a difference is often the only expedient route to maintain power in order to make small differences for the better . \nGovernment 's of weakened powers like Britain can only make small inroads , and Governments ca n't really do that much . \nWe expect too much from them . \nAnd , it is not possible for them to always tell the truth , and to do so would reduce their hold on power . \nIt is amazing how those in power will also subsume their internal checks of personal integrity to believign their own propaganda . \nIt is what enables those with a conscience to survive . \nPosted by rosie brocklehurst on April 3 , 2005 02:42 PM . \nI rumbled Blair before he was elected : he said in an interview that he would be prepared to use nuclear weapons . \nAny politician who says this is prepared to commit the ultimate act of terror . \nThat he claims to be a Christian only makes it worse . \nSo I have never been surprised that Blair has proved a warmonger . \nAbout Iraq I knew he was lying : I had read Scott Ritter and considered the effects of sanctions on Iraq and it was clear to me -LRB- and I indicated my belief in public before the war started -RRB- that Hussein had no weapons of mass destruction . \nAn ordinary member of the public like myself was right and Spooks United were wrong - which shows just how dangerous these people are particularly now that what they can say can deprive people of their liberty That Blair was not really concerned about a terrorist attack on this country was shown when he insisted on making war on Iraq . \nHe had been warned that if he did so the risk of a terrorist attack would be increased . \nThat should have been decisive in stopping him . \nThat it was n't showed waht his real priorities were As for DAs attempt to justify a kind of `` humanitarian '' war against a tyrant because of his violation of human rights -LRB- even though he knows that such a war is still illegal under international law -RRB- he and others like him do not seem to realize that the people who are killed in such a war -LRB- or incapacitated or injured -RRB- are deprived of their human rights in consequence , so that a war to get rid Hussein because he did not value human life is showing the same lack of concern for it No wonder there is torture and imprisonment without trial in Iraq today Blair is either a fool or a knave . \nI do not believe he is a fool . \nPosted by malcolm pittock on April 3 , 2005 02:47 PM . \nThis is what the IFS 's press release notes : `` As a result , income inequality -LRB- measured by the Gini coefficient -RRB- fell for the third successive year . \nBut the Households Below Average Income data are drawn from a sample of only 25,000 households out of a total of around 25 million so we can only be 90 % certain that the fall in measured inequality over the latest three years is genuine rather than the result of an unrepresentative sample -LRB- 95 % certainty is usually required for the change to be regarded as statistically significant -RRB- . \nThe decline in the last three years still leaves inequality higher than the level Labor inherited , but not by a statistically significant amount .

'' \nAn extended account will be posted shortly on my site . \nDo however visit the following for a nuanced approach : Posted by Dylan Calder on April 3 , 2005 04:23 PM . \nThere are two streams of leftist thought at work here : The first and most popular is a kind of default cynicism : anti-war -LRB- not just Iraq , most of the usual suspects were against Afghanistan and Kosovo as well -RRB- ; anti-new labor -LRB- ignoring all achievements , longing for 1983 style socialism , exaggerating regressive policies - `` most draconian post-war home secretary `` etc ; and keen to caricature Blair as a Tory or a Neocon . \nThe consequence of this approach is that the millions of people , at home and abroad , who have benifited from Labor policies are forgotten or ignored . \nThe second approach - represented by Aaronovitch - sees this government as realistically social democratic , justifiably interventionist on occasion , and about as liberal as it can get away with in the process . \nThis approach is , at least , as principled as the former but based on different principles - social democracy ; humanitarian interventionism ; anti-fascism rather than pacifism , anti-imperialism or Foot\\/Benn-like anti-capitalism . \nThe problem is that the first group claim a monopoly on being left-wing . \nI think the war in Iraq was just for humanitarian reasons -LRB- the number of civilian deaths render this position difficult but all wars result in civilian deaths and I thought the cause of anti-fascism made this war defendable -RRB- . \nI also think the governments public spending record , back-door redistribution , and basic social liberalism are worth supporting at elections . \nI regard both of these positions as fundamentally left-wing . \nPosted by Popsensible on April 3 , 2005 04:50 PM . \nPosted by Dylan Calder on April 3 , 2005 05:21 PM . \nPosted by Mat as Pizarro on April 3 , 2005 05:25 PM . \nI hope Tony Blair is duly dismissed in May .

'' \nI agree that the left should challenge Bush et al on their attempts to hijack democracy as a vehicle of the right . \nDemocracy was first set up precisely to try to limit the types of gross misuse of power , by the powerful , which the clumsy use of force in Iraq seems to be . \nIt is not enough for labor to be content to just try and drag us up to the level of the other well functioning European Social democracies . \nIt also needs to work to challenge the ways in which liberalisation and unrestrained market forces are destroying substantive democracy , in terms of protection of the weak , within the deeply undemocratic global scene we inhabit . \nSupporting the US in it 's undemocratic practices was a blow against the left and against democracy . \nYes , labor has achieved something during it 's term , but could have achieved more if it had been bolder in challenging the interests of business -LRB- which is what ` market forces ' covers up . -RRB- \nPublic private partnerships are a disgrace , universities have become meat factories for the administrative age , the market runs rampant to the point of children being expected to exercise their free choice towards a `` natural equilibrium '' of healthy meals . \nThis is market fundamentalism , and a disgrace to the left . \nAaranovitch needs to get out a bit more and see what 's happening out in the wider world . \nHe might risk missing a few of his beloved Spurs maches , but he might also risk learning something . \nPosted by Daniel Taghioff on April 3 , 2005 10:01 PM . \nPosted by stephen mullin on April 3 , 2005 10:02 PM . \nPosted by Peter Johnston on April 3 , 2005 10:21 PM . \nPosted by Penny Joy on April 3 , 2005 10:27 PM . \nPosted by Richard Bewley on April 3 , 2005 11:28 PM . \nThere is much to agree with in David Aaronovich s tirade against the supperazzi . \nI have always reluctantly agreed with him on the war , that the war was justified by the possibility that deposing another dictator might encourager les autres and that effectively labeling Iraq as a faraway country of which we know little , as many on the left do , is as immoral now as it was in 1938 . \nI term this the Aaronovitch Defense . \nIt does not require a na ve belief in the goodness of US -LRB- or UK -RRB- intentions nor a belief in WMDs . \nIt would have been nice though if WMDs had been available as a further reason to oust Saddam . \nI must say therefore that when I heard the absolute milksop statements in the dossiers , even after they had been sexed up , I was dismayed . \nIs this all they have ? \nwas my immediate reaction . \nI frankly I am incredulous that Blair ever believed that WMDs were a serious reason for going to war . \nTo do so he would have to possess little political or even just human judgement . \nWe know that not to be true . \nI would never accuse Blair of stupidity . \nNor would I accuse most Labor MPs of stupidity so it is impossible to believe they were taken in by the dossiers either . \nIt is quite clear that Blair played the WMD line because it gave a semblance of legal cover to the war which , in contrast to Bush , he felt he needed , and that the Labor party en masse perfectly understood this and went along with it . \nThose who now say they were duped are guilty of hypocritical humbug . \nOf course the war has been appallingly handled and some of this may have been due to the American government s tainted motivation as opposed to its manifest incompetence , but that is a separate matter . \nHowever , I do think DA , in supporting the government as decidedly better than the Thatcherite Tories -LRB- or even any Tories -RRB- by citing their undoubted plus points , is missing the main point . \nIn a historical context we have been going in the wrong direction for some time . \nHyper-capitalism spewing out of the bowels of Sloan and other US business schools is driving the Plain People relentlessly back into a state of servitude . \nCapitalists , and actually I include the businessmen who run their enterprises , have returned to the beliefs of 1830s England . \nThey see it as not only their right to accumulate wealth but their duty . \nAnd they support this with a neat morality which places responsibility to the shareholder above all other morals . \nIt s good isn t it ? \nNo need for all that nonsense from Plato , Aristotle , Thomas Aquinas , Hobbes , Locke , John Stuart Mill etc. . \nIt s shareholder responsibility stupid . \nActually even this line is bogus . \nThe only real morality is about milking as much as possible from the Board Compensation Committee . \nI believe that opposition to Blair because he has clearly placed himself on the side of Capital , probably not because he believes it is right but because he believes he can do little about it , is a perfectly coherent position . \nThis is not to say he is completely wrong . \nIt is indeed very hard to see how turbo-capitalism can be opposed . \nFor at least 60 years , intermittently more if you count Lloyd George , government has seen its job at least partly as holding the ring between the barons and the People . \nBut Blair is not now on our side . \nNow Robin Hood has joined the Sheriff s men and we can be downsized , outsourced , worked to death , short-changed and forsaken in retirement to Capitalism s heart s content . \nThis is further advanced in America but Blair seems determined to turn us into the New Yanks . \nAnd I am not sure Brown is much better . \n-LRB- Remember the Tube PFI -RRB- . \nBeside this betrayal all the little good things Blair has done and all the shameful small betrayals -LRB- pummelling single mothers , victimising asylum seekers , promoting gambling as our national salvation . -RRB- \nOf course the other lot are worse . \nPosted by David Quinn on April 3 , 2005 11:50 PM . \nHell , I even spent three weeks stalking Polly Toynbee . \nNot a sun-dried tomato in sight . \nI have n't been to a dinner party in months , nearly a year . \nHere I remain , eating supermarket mini-pizzas on my own , with only my keyboard and next-door 's cat for company . \nAnd yet , somehow , I still disagree with a large number of my party 's policies . \nHow can this be ?

and right hate Blair with such ferocity . \nHow revealing too that The Guardian gives more space to the right than to supporters of Blair . \nBoth the liberal and traditional left are behaving disgracefully . \nNeither can bear the reality of a center left government because it involves compromises . \nThey far prefer the security and purity of oppositional politics . \nYes , for the left , like the right , the worst possible situation is not to have a Conservative government . \nThe left , now utterly devoid of realistic politics or economics , is reduced to nothing but cliches about Blair 's ` Thatcherism ' plus the economic illiteracy of ` anti-globalisation ' plus , the most important element of all , hatred of the US and its allies -LRB- especially the ` poodle ' Blair -RRB- . \nIt ignores or justifies any monstrosities , so long as they are cloaked in ` anti-imperialist ' -LRB- i.e. , anti-US -RRB- clothing -LRB- terrorism in Iraq , Saddam 's crimes , Mugabe 's reign of fear , Islamic terrorism -RRB- . \nThe left is devoid of serious political ideas now that their fantasy politics of go left and win elections has been resoundingly tested to destruction in four successive UK elections between 1979 and 1992 . \nThe left might hate the fact that middle class votes are essential for winning elections but it s a fact of life . \nTheir idealised working class have never supported favorite leftwing policies , for instance , wholesale nationalisation . \nNor has the working class ever been attracted to the left s near pacifism or , even worse , their universal assumption that all UK defense policy is imperialist . \nSimilarly , the economics of the left is bankrupt : planned economies are no longer an option and , in any case , were authoritarian and inefficient . \nPublic servants , although often admirable , can be knaves as well as knights -LRB- Julian Le Grand -RRB- . \nPublic bureaucracies are funded by working people and exist to serve them , not the workers who staff them . \nBlair and -LRB- yes ! -RRB- \nBrown -LRB- for all his opportunistic posturing -RRB- believe that the future for the left is dynamic market economies married with strong welfare states . \nIn the left s fury at their own historical failure , they castigate Blair for his Thatcherism this about a man whose government has generously funded welfare services and public services and raised taxes both to fund these and support generous tax credits for the poorest . \nThe liberal left , at least , should know better because they , at least , in principle , support the Blairite marriage of dynamic market economies and social justice through strong public services . \nBut , even for them Blair 's alleged ghastly failings are infinitely more significant than -LRB- a -RRB- the many positive achievements of his government and -LRB- b -RRB- all the atrocities carried out by self-styled ` radicals ' in the developing world . \nPosted by DL , London on

as a blunderbuss against Labor . \nIf Labor does not win the next election the Tories will not the Lib Dems , not Respect . \nThe Government from my point of view has a patchy record , but it is in the nature of democracy that very few people will like everything a government does we have different values and interests . \nI am quite certain that if it wins a third term the effect on the population as a whole , and particularly on the most disadvantaged , will be good rather than bad , undoubtedly much better than that of the Conservatives would be . \nAnd yes , I know people -LRB- not quite so high-powered and rich -RRB- like those described by Aaronovitch . \nThis is a typical case , a woman I encountered at a Christmas party . \nHow she longed for a really radical Labor government the thought brought tears to her eyes . \nHowever , in the meantime , and because public services are so bad under Labor , she is forced to use private health services and education , and of course she pays cleaners and tradesman cash in hand , because we all dislike paying tax , do n't we ? \nThere really are quite a lot of these people , and one characteristic they share is profound and what must be wilful ignorance of what Labor has actually done ; the Children Leaving Care Act , the repeal of s28 of the Local Government Act , Sure Start and the effect on low incomes of working people of the tax credits , for example ; I know scarcely anyone outside public services who is at all aware of such measures . \nI think they do n't want to know these things , partly because they are well-heeld themselves but also because expressing really radical views while declaring it to be impossible to vote Labor combines nicely a preferred self-image and covert pursuit of self-interest under the Conservatives . \nGetting to grips with what has actually been done in this country and deciding between the rather better and the much worse requires recognition that politics is about the negotiation of conflicting interests , not a theater where all the right-thinking automatically see their visions realized . \nIn Iraq , their hope seems to be that things will get worse and worse , which would justify their opposition . \nI opposed it , but I mind about the Iraqi people as well as the British people , and I want things to improve in both countries . \nI will just add that in my experience citizens who work hard to improve and change policies , through the tedium and labor of campaigning , drawing up objections for public inquiries , etc , are far more likely to recognize the complexity of the political system and the impossibility of gaining everything we want . \nSometimes we win something , because out representation of our views is more persuasive than that of those who differ from us ; we never win everything . \nOne thing is certain , though : talking down a Labor government never did the majority fo the population any good , Posted by Liz Mandeville on April 5 , 2005 11:48 AM . \nThank you for writing an article that expresses the same sentiment that i felt when reading Richard Eyre 's piece last week - except you expressed yourself much more articulately than I would have done . \nRichard Eyre 's smug , self satisfied drivel , based on little factual evidence , made me very angry . \nOnce again you have hit the nail on the head . \nDavid Aaronovitch attacks the ` cynicism ' of ` dinner-party Britain ' for criticising Tony Blair over subservience to neo-conservative US foreign policy , infringements of domestic civil liberties and the manipulative use of the politics of fear . \nThe intelligentsia , he suggests , is out of touch with the working class , who have benefited under Labor from a reduction in relative poverty and an alleged increase in the quality of life through the judicious use of ASBOs . \nDoes Aaronovitch assume that the working class is motivated purely by self-interest and is unable to vote according to matters of principle ? \nI live in a working class area of Manchester and everyone I know would agree with the ` bruschetta orthodoxy ' that ` Blair is a pious , lying , hypocritical warmonger . ' \nIn the words of a friend of mine , Aaronvitch 's assertion that ` if you 're clever and you are n't going to vote Labor because of the war you must be a quiche-eating , moaning Hampstead ponce who 's got it easy , is entirely scurrilous . ' \nPosted by DJ Welch on April 5 , 2005 05:40 PM . \nIt is rare -LRB- and perhaps slightly worrying -RRB- to agree 100 % with an article in any newspaper but Aaronovitch s piece struck a chord with me . \nThe smart set -LRB- Lessing , Lanchester , Honderich and Eyre -RRB- who decry Blair and his government do so out of snobbery and fashion . \nTheir photographs in the article show them to be well into their wrinkly years and yet their memories are depressingly short . \nThey sit comfortably in their academic eyries mumbling into their soup and complaining - about what ? \nThat Blair is a pragmatist ? \nThat he compromises his positions ? \nThat he wants the benefits of as mixed economy without doctrinaire prejudice ? \nIsn t that what being a politician is all about ? \nThe intellectual snobs who castigate the Prime Minister -LRB- like these four -RRB- have absolutely no alternatives to present . \nThey know what they don t want but they haven t a clue about what they do want expect in the fluffiest of terms . \nGet real my friends fluffy intellectuals don t get elected . \nClever Blair does -LRB- yes Blair is much cleverer than the Dinner Party would like to think -RRB- . \nI hope that he -LRB- Blair -RRB- wins the next election and I actually think that he deserves to . \nPosted by Paddy Briggs on April 5 , 2005 07:06 PM . \nThank you David Aaronovitch for expressing so eloquently the malaise amongst so many on the left who seem to prefer the prospect of Michael Howard as Prime Minister to another Labor term . \nTony Blair and his government are trying hard to rebuild public services and improve the prospects of the less advantaged in society . \nOf course they have made mistakes but exercising power is difficult . \nThey have delivered economic stability and high levels of employment - we should be giving them credit not trying to punish them . \nAnd those people who claim to be voting for a hung parliament or a reduced labor majority should recall what happened to Jospin in France . \nI supported the Iraq war with anxiety and misgivings but believe that we are seeing the beginnings of real democracy in Iraq . \nEvery time I wavered I only had to remind myself of the pre-war cringe-making , sycophantic interview a star-struck Tony Benn conducted with Saddam Hussein to know that I definitely was not on the side of the stop the war coalition . \nPosted by AJ , London on April 5 , 2005 10:54 PM . \nThank you David for your timely well-targetted piece . \nI have yet to hear any of the Dinner Party follow the logic of their convictions and argue that Saddam Hussein should be considered the legitimate ruler of Iraq and call for his restoration . \nWhat about this for a scenario had Saddam not been ejected ? \nFollowing the failure of the UN weapons inspectors to find WMD during 2003\\/4 -LRB- despite unanimity at the time among the international community concerning their likely existence -RRB- Saddam 's apologists in the West were successful in their campaign to have UN sanctions lifted . \nSaddam then puts into effect his plans to acquire WMD . \nAny attempt then to dislodge Saddam -LRB- or , worse , his psychpathic son Uday , who oversaw the poisonings at Halabja -RRB- would have been far more dangerous , both for those that had the courage to confront him and for countries neighbouring Iraq . \nUnlike members of the Dinner Party , those with responsibility of high office have difficult choices to make that can not be escaped . \nI believe that Tony Blair acted honourably in seeking to discharge his responsibilities . \nI can accept that many disagreed with the war , and do so vehemently , but I find the willingness of some endlessly to repeat the lie that Tony Blair lied intentionally and cynically in making the case for war , and their evident wish for this to be true , does their case no credit . \nPosted by Neil , North Wales on April 6 , 2005 09:46 AM . \nThank you , David for your well-handled rage and dissection of the chattering classes . \nHow much more you could have helped those of us on the defensive on the dinner party circuit had you bothered to refute these empty accusations . \n`` As reported or argued in articles , reviews , interviews or diaries , this story includes the following necessary elements : Labor would have won in 1997 anyway without Tony Blair ; Labor are now pretty much the same as the Tories , that s why there is so much apathy ; Blair has no social vision , he just wants power for its own sake ; new Labor is in hock to America for strange psychological reasons to do with power and weaponry ; Labor wishes to privatise the public services ; Labor hasn t achieved anything of any note ; Labor represents a unique threat to our ancient liberties ; Blair is a pious , lying hypocritical warmonger ; he is trying to scare us unnecessarily ; there is no such thing as a terrorist threat or if there is such a thing , then it s no worse than when the IRA was active , or if it is worse , then it s the consequence of Western arrogance and globalisation . '' \nSo-called Black Wednesday in September 1992 , when the pound was humiliatingly forced out of the ERM , might have started the process by which the British economy was revived , but being an unplanned accident , it destroyed the Tories ' reputation for sound financial management . '' \nYet try to convince these `` bruschetarati '' that Labor would not have won even if it had Peter Mandleson as leader and changed it 's name to the `` Me '' party ? \nDavid , as we dig into the vol-au-vents , we cry to you , `` Tell us , tell us how Labor is different from the Tories ? \nShow us Blair 's social vision . \nThey keep saying he pinched it from Jamie Oliver . '' \nWe hear such nasty things about the sainted Tony ; how he halved PMQs ; how he 's never in the House ; how he 's replaced cabinet resonsibility with presidential edicts . \nWe want a sign that shows he really really cares as much as he says he does . \nShow us Blair has stood up to President Bush in the way that John Major stood up to his father . \nWe , your fans , David , know that cutting trial by jury , double jeopardy , the abolition of habeus corpus , the introduction of ID cards , Asbos restricting one 's right to wear what one likes on one 's own property , set back individual rights not a bit , but our guests bray so ! \nI know and you know David , that there is a terrible terrorist threat . \nThe IRA were unsublte and planted bombs and killed people . \nThe new terrorist are far more cunning and dangerous . \nThey do n't do anything ! \nWe must stop them before they do n't do it again . \nI 'm fed up with these smug middle-class people with facts . \nOld Marxists like you and I would not trouble ourselves with anything so vulgar . \nPosted by Dave Weeden on April 6 , 2005 02:03 PM . \nPosted by Patrick on April 6 , 2005 05:06 PM . \nBrian V Peck : author of Walking on the Moon ...

{"id": "142", "time": "2005-08-06", "text": "Saturday 6 August 2005 20.18 BST The former foreign secretary Robin Cook has died after collapsing on a mountain in Scotland , Scottish police have announced . \nMr Cook had apparently collapsed with a suspected heart attack on the mountainside while out walking during his summer holidays . \nHe was also reported to have seriously injured himself in a fall after his collapse . \nThe father-of-two grown up sons was on the mountain for nearly half an hour before rescue services reached him . \nThen , guided by medical experts via telephone , they battled to revive him using cardio pulmonary resuscitation equipment , before he was airlifted by helicopter to hospital in Inverness . \nMr Cook arrived at hospital at 4pm - some 90 minutes after his collapse and was declared dead five minutes later , said a spokesman for NHS Highland . \nBut it was more than three hours later before police confirmed his death . \nA police spokesman added : `` As is normal in such circumstances , a report will be prepared for the Procurator Fiscal . '' \nPrime minister Tony Blair described Mr Cook as `` an outstanding , extraordinary talent '' . \nIn a statement released by 10 Downing Street , Mr Blair said : `` Our thoughts and prayers are with Gaynor and all Robin 's family . \n`` This news will be received with immense sadness , not just in Britain but in many parts of the world . \n`` Robin was an outstanding , extraordinary talent - brilliant , incisive in debate , of incredible skill and persuasive power . '' \nMr Cook was a keen hill-walker , who regularly spent his summer holidays with close family and friends enjoying the dramatic mountain scenery of Highland Scotland , rather than going abroad . \nA leading figure in the Labor party for decades , Mr Cook was put in the key job of foreign secretary when the party won power in 1997 . \nHe was demoted to the post of leader of the Commons following Labor 's second election victory in 2001 and resigned from the cabinet in protest at the Iraq war in 2003 . \nHe then became one of the sharpest critics of the government 's foreign policy in Iraq . \nMr Cook 's devotion to enhancing the role of parliament as leader of the Commons made him a popular figure among backbench MPs , and his powerful resignation speech on the eve of war won him great respect from opponents of military action . \n"}
{"id": "108", "time": "2005-08-30", "text": "How to stop civil war Nicaragua and South Africa , not the US , should be the inspiration for the people framing Iraq 's constitution Tuesday 30 August 2005 11.05 BST Between the idea and the reality falls the shadow of occupation . \nWhatever the parliamentarians in Iraq do to try to prevent total meltdown , their efforts are compromised by the fact that their power grows from the barrel of someone else 's gun . \nWhen George Bush picked up the phone last week to urge the negotiators to sign the constitution , he reminded Iraqis that their representatives - though elected - remain the administrators of his protectorate . \nWhile US and British troops stay in Iraq , no government there can make an undisputed claim to legitimacy . \nNothing can be resolved in that country until our armies leave . \nThis is by no means the only problem confronting the people who drafted Iraq 's constitution . \nThe refusal by the Shias and the Kurds to make serious compromises on federalism , which threatens to deprive the central , Sunni-dominated areas of oil revenues , leaves the Sunnis with little choice but to reject the agreement in October 's referendum . \nThe result could be civil war . \nCan anything be done ? \nIt might be too late . \nBut it seems to me that the transitional assembly has one last throw of the dice . \nThis is to abandon the constitution it has signed , and Bush 's self-serving timetable , and start again with a different democratic design . \nThe problem with the way the constitution was produced is the problem afflicting almost all the world 's democratic processes . \nThe deliberations were back to front . \nFirst the members of the constitutional committee , shut inside the green zone , argue over every dot and comma ; then they present the whole thing -LRB- 25 pages in English translation -RRB- to the people for a yes or no answer . \nThe question and the answer are meaningless . \nAll politically conscious people , having particular interests and knowing that perfection in politics is impossible , will , on reading a complex document like this , see that it is good in some places and bad in others . \nThey might recognize some articles as being bad for them but good for society as a whole ; they might recognize others as being good or bad for almost everyone . \nWhat then does yes or no mean ? \nLet me be more precise . \nHow , for example , could anyone agree with both these statements , from articles 2 and 19 respectively ? \n`` Islam is the official religion of the state and is a basic source of legislation : no law can be passed that contradicts the undisputed rules of Islam . '' \n-LRB- In other words , the supreme authority in law is God . -RRB- \n`` The judiciary is independent , with no power above it other than the law . '' \nOr both these , from articles 14 and 148 ? \n`` Iraqis are equal before the law without discrimination because of sex , ethnicity , nationality , origin , color , religion , sect , belief , opinion or social or economic status '' ; `` Members of the presidential council must ... have left the dissolved party -LRB- the Ba'ath -RRB- at least 10 years before its fall if they were members in it . '' \nFaced with such contradictions , no thoughtful elector can wholly endorse or reject this document . \nOf course , this impossible choice is what we would have confronted -LRB- but at 10 times the length and a hundred times the complexity -RRB- had we been asked to vote on the European constitution . \nThe yes or no question put to us would have been just as stupid , and just as just as stupefying . \nIt treats us like idiots and - because we can not refine our responses - reduces us to idiots . \nBut while it would have merely enhanced our sense of alienation from the European project , for the Iraqis the meaninglessness of the question could be a matter of life and death . \nIf there is not a widespread sense of public ownership of the country 's political processes , and a widespread sense that political differences can be meaningfully resolved by democratic means , this empowers those who seek to resolve them otherwise . \nLast week George Bush , echoed on these pages by Bill Clinton 's former intelligence adviser Philip Bobbitt , compared the drafting process in Baghdad to the construction of the American constitution . \nIf they believe that the comparison commends itself to the people of Iraq , they are plainly even more out of touch than I thought . \nBut it should also be obvious that we now live in more sceptical times . \nWhen the US constitution was drafted , representative democracy was a radical and thrilling idea . \nNow it is an object of suspicion and even contempt , as people all over the world recognize that it allows us to change the management but not the firm . \nAnd one of the factors that have done most to engender public scepticism is the meaninglessness of the only questions we are ever asked . \nI read Labor 's manifesto before the last election and found good and bad in it . \nBut whether I voted for or against , I had no means to explain what I liked and what I did n't . \nDoes it require much imagination to see the link between our choice of meaningless absolutes and the Manichean worldview our leaders have evolved ? \nWe must decide at elections whether they are right or wrong - about everything . \nShould we then be surprised when they start talking about good and evil , friend and foe , being with them or against them ? \nAlmost two years ago Troy Davis , a democracy-engineering consultant , pointed out that if a constitutional process in Iraq was to engender trust and national commitment , it had to `` promote a culture of democratic debate '' . \nLike Professor Vivien Hart , of the University of Sussex , he argued that it should draw on the experiences of Nicaragua in 1986 , where 100,000 people took part in townhall meetings reviewing the draft constitution , and of South Africa , where the public made 2 million submissions to the drafting process . \nIn both cases , the sense of public ownership this fostered accelerated the process of reconciliation . \nNot only is your own voice heard in these public discussions , but you must also hear others . \nHearing them , you are confronted with the need for compromise . \nBut when negotiations are confined to the green zone 's black box , the Iraqis have no sense that the process belongs to them . \nBecause they are not asked to participate , they are not asked to understand where other people 's interests lie and how they might be accommodated . \nAnd when the whole thing goes belly up , it will be someone else 's responsibility . \nIf Iraq falls apart over the next couple of years , it would not be unfair , among other factors , to blame the fact that Davis and Hart were ignored . \nFor the people who designed Iraq 's democratic processes , history stopped in 1787 . \nDeliberative democracy is not a panacea . \nYou can have fake participatory processes just as you can have fake representative ones . \nBut it is hard to see why representation can not be tempered by participation . \nWhy should we be forbidden to choose policies , rather than just parties or entire texts ? \nCan we not be trusted ? \nIf not , then what is the point of elections ? \nThe age of purely representative democracy is surely over . \nIt is time the people had their say . \n"}

{"id": "239", "time": "2005-10-03", "text": "` The cardinal rule ... you do n't target civilians ' Brian Whitaker on a new Human Rights Watch report examining the aims and methods of the insurgency in Iraq Monday 3 October 2005 14.34 BST Aisha Gadafy , the daughter of the Libyan leader , declared her support for insurgents in Iraq last week . \nOpening a conference on human rights in Tripoli , she said : `` Freedom is taken by force and not granted , and the rights of people are taken by their own hands ... What is happening in Iraq can not be ignored by any honest person ... the Iraqi land is occupied , people are dying , scientists are being assassinated and women are being raped . \n`` We salute proudly the fighters of the Iraqi resistance who were able to break the American dream . '' \nHer view is shared by many in the Arab\\/Islamic world and beyond , although not necessarily by a majority of ordinary Iraqis . \n`` Districts like Ameriyah have become Jihadi Central , '' Salam Pax , the Baghdad blogger , complained a few days ago . \n`` After they blew up all the clothes shops there , they started blowing up grocery shops , and now they have moved on to shops selling watches . \nVery symbolic , is n't it ? \nTime stops HERE . '' \nTwo days before Aisha made her speech , insurgents seized five Shia teachers and their driver as they left a primary school , lined them up against a wall and shot them dead . \nA prominent Shia cleric , Ayatollah Mohammed al-Yaaqubi , responded by adopting the Israeli approach , issuing a religious edict allowing his followers to `` kill terrorists -LRB- or at least people they think might be terrorists -RRB- before they kill '' . \nIt is unclear how many civilians have been killed by insurgents in Iraq , although the Iraqi government says there were 1,594 civilian deaths as a result of bombings , assassinations and armed clashes with insurgents during the first six months of this year . \nDeaths among the Iraqi security forces during the same period totalled 895 . \nThose who join insurgent groups have a variety of goals . \nAs well as seeking to expel foreign forces from Iraq , some are resisting the marginalisation of Sunni Muslims by the Shia-dominated government , while others are fighting for control of strategic areas such as Kirkuk . \nSome see themselves as being engaged in a global struggle for Islam . \nThe killing of civilians by insurgents is not incidental , however , but forms part of an overall strategy . \nThis includes : Punishing individuals - drivers , contractors , translators , etc - for collaboration , with the aim of discouraging others from taking on this kind of work . \nPunishing members of religious or ethnic communities , either because they are thought to be co-operating with foreign forces or - in the case of the Kurds and the Shia - because of their influence within Iraq . \nPressurising foreign governments to abandon Iraq . \nThis not only includes nations with military forces in the country , but also others that have merely established diplomatic relations . \nUndermining the Iraqi government by attacking politicians , officials and their families . \nDiverting resources from military tasks in order to protect `` soft '' targets . \nImpeding reconstruction by attacking pipelines , electricity supplies , etc. . \nProvoking a heavy-handed response from the security forces in the hope of winning new recruits . \nThese tactics are challenged in a report issued today by Human Rights Watch , which accuses the insurgents of war crimes . \nThe laws of war do not outlaw insurgent groups or prohibit attacks on legitimate military targets , the report says - but they restrict the means and manner of attacks and oblige all forces in a conflict to protect civilians and other non-combatants . \n`` There are no justifications for targeting civilians , in Iraq or anywhere else , '' said Sarah Leah Whitson , the Middle East director of Human Rights Watch . \n`` Armed groups as well as governments must respect the laws of war . '' \nThe organization , based in Washington , has previously documented abuses by US forces in Iraq as well as torture by the Iraqi police . \n`` US forces have used excessive and indiscriminate force , tortured detainees and held thousands of Iraqis without due process , '' Ms Whitson said . \n`` But that does not justify attacks by insurgent groups that have deliberately targeted and killed civilians . '' \nThe 140-page report - entitled A Face and a Name : Civilian Victims of Insurgent Groups in Iraq - examines some of the arguments used by insurgents to justify the killing of civilians . \nIn the eyes of one former Iraqi general quoted in the report , `` every Iraqi or foreigner who works with the coalition is a target . \nMinistries , mercenaries , translators , businessmen , cooks or maids , it does n't matter the degree of collaboration . \nTo sign a contract with the occupier is to sign your death certificate '' . \nIraqi government officials `` are all spies , traitors , and agents for the Americans '' , according to a spokesman for the insurgent group Jaysh Muhammad . \nTo the head of the pro-Saddam group , Wahaj al-Iraq , the Iraqi parliament and government are `` the institutions of the aggressor '' . \nShia Muslims , Kurds and Christians are also legitimate targets , according to some insurgents . \n`` The American forces and their intelligence systems have found a safe haven and refuge amongst their brethren the grandchildren of monkeys and swine in Iraq , '' one group said when claiming responsibility for attacking five churches in Mosul and Baghdad . \nWesterners in Iraq - whether contractors , journalists or aid workers - are also considered elements , or potential elements , of a foreign occupation , the report says . \nAccording to a statement by the Assadullah -LRB- Lion of God -RRB- Brigades , `` the mujahid -LRB- holy fighter -RRB- is entitled to capture any infidel that enters Iraq , whether he works for a construction company or in any other job , because he could be a warrior , and the mujahid has the right to kill him or take him as a prisoner '' . \nAn audio tape attributed to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi , the leader of al-Qaidain Iraq , went even further : `` The killing of infidels by any method including martyrdom -LRB- suicide -RRB- operations has been sanctified by many scholars even if it means killing innocent Muslims . \n`` This legality has been agreed upon ... so as not to disrupt jihad , '' the speaker said . \n`` The shedding of Muslim blood ... is allowed in order to avoid the greater evil of disrupting jihad . '' \nCoupled with these arguments is a view that because the US has overwhelming technology and firepower , any means of resistance can be justified - including the murder of civilians . \nSome also point to double standards in the application of international law , arguing that insurgent groups should not be expected to respect the law when the other side disregards it . \nNone of these justifications is legally defensible , the Human Rights Watch report concludes . \n`` The justifications for attacking specific groups of people misread or misapply the definition of a civilian as it applies under the laws of war , '' it says . \n`` The arguments that international law does not apply -LRB- to insurgent groups -RRB- are contrary to long-accepted understandings of the applicability of the laws of war . \n`` International humanitarian law provides that in all armed conflicts , whether during armed conflicts between states , occupations or civil wars , the parties must at all times distinguish between civilians and combatants . \n`` According to the principle of civilian immunity , attacks may only be directed against combatants , and never civilians . '' \nElaborating on the legal difference between combatants and civilians , the report continues : `` Civilians are defined as persons who are not members of the armed forces . \nA civilian is protected against attack unless ... he or she takes a direct part in hostilities . \n`` In practice , a civilian would temporarily lose immunity by , for instance , picking up a weapon and engaging in fighting , loading ammunition during a battle or spotting targets for artillery . \nCivilians involved in the planning of military operations or who are giving orders to military forces likewise may be subject to attack . \n`` While a worker in a munitions factory may be assisting the war effort , the absence of direct participation in hostilities means the person can not be subject to attack -LRB- the munitions factory is a legitimate target , however , and the worker bears the risks of being present there -RRB- . '' \nIn the Arab world , the invasion of Iraq under false pretences and scandals such as the abuse of prisoners in Abu Ghraib have tended to divert attention from the ruthless brutality of the insurgents . \n`` Because so many people support the cause of the insurgency , they have been unwilling to critique the methods and the means , '' Ms Whitson said . \n`` Whatever your position on the war , the means of doing it is wrong . \nAt Human Rights Watch we do n't take a view on the decision to go to war or the decision to resist ... but the cardinal rule is that you do n't target civilians .

I would do it anyway . \nHe said he would help on the politics , but not `` the other stuff '' . \nI got to know him well in those early years of government ; not as well as some , and not as well as I might have liked . \nCook was alternately warm and offhand , intellectually impressive but strangely lacking in strategic sense . \nHe knew he was capable of terrible put-downs , and wished it otherwise . \nHe knew he should have made shrewder alliances , but did not seem to care enough to change . \nAnd yet , for all his personal foibles , he did more than perhaps any single politician of his generation to restore faith in the profession . \nHe was a man of deep conviction , a man who would compromise only under duress . \nAn evening with him - copiously supplied with malt whisky - was always invigorating . \nConversation with him was intellectually stimulating . \nI know precious few among his profession who on that score come close . \nThere was something about Cook that unnerved lesser minds . \nThere was something about him that unnerved those of similar minds . \nHis feud with Gordon Brown will go down as one of the great lost opportunities of progressive politics . \nTwo men of similar backgrounds - son of teacher , son of preacher , both making their mark in Edinburgh politics - could have forged a potent alliance . \nAt first they did work together , co-editing a book in 1974 , the year Cook , the older and senior figure , first entered parliament . \nNobody can quite tell - not even the protagonists - exactly when and why their relationship turned sour . \nThe one incident that several people point to is the launch of their second pamphlet in 1983 when , with Brown still on his way to the meeting , Cook started it early , giving the impression it was all his idea . \nCook was slower than Brown to adapt to the strictures of New Labor . \nHe resented the spin tactics that began to take hold in the early 1990s -LRB- although in government he retained a curious respect for Alastair Campbell -RRB- . \nOn policy , he was slower than others to shed old certainties such as state ownership , unilateral nuclear disarmament and hostility to the European Community . \nParadoxically , given everything that was to follow , Cook resented Blair for giving him the foreign affairs portfolio in 1994 . \nHe held Brown responsible for that - and he was not wrong . \nHe was frozen out of the important discussions on economic affairs . \nAs he mustered enthusiasm for the new job , Cook saw an opportunity to forge a radical foreign policy , breaking with the cynicism of the Tory years that had led to a surge in weapons sales and dodgy trade deals masquerading as international development . \nHis single-handed destruction of the Major government over the arms-to-Iraq scandal in 1996 has been attributed to his forensic skill . \nBut there was passion and raw anger too . \nWhen , a few weeks into office , he declared a new `` ethical dimension '' to his foreign policy , he accepted he would be mocked by the opposition and parts of the press . \nHe was bitterly upset , but not surprised , when Blair was so contemptuous of measures such as a tightening of the rules on arms sales . \nCook lost what political independence he had the moment his marriage broke up so publicly . \nHe became dependent on the Blair machine for his survival . \nAfter a turbulent first year he performed with increasing professionalism , handling prewar negotiations on Kosovo with aplomb . \nHe became an increasingly respected figure in the EU . \nHe performed a 180-degree turn , becoming a proselytiser for the European cause . \nBut the ease with which Blair dispensed with his services in 2001 demonstrated the shallowness of Cook 's political base . \nIt has become a commonplace to portray Cook 's opposition to the war on Iraq as one of great principle . \nIt was , but it was also rooted in pragmatism . \nWhile still in the cabinet he insisted on being briefed on the latest intelligence . \nCook suggested to me that he possibly would have gone along with the war if the evidence had been compelling . \nIt was shoddy and the man with the forensic mind could not understand how Blair and those around him had been so hoodwinked . \nEven as he resigned , however , Cook sought to minimize the damage to the government . \nHe could have made his departing speech at the start of the crucial debate on Iraq , but allowed himself to be convinced by Campbell not to . \nIt is possible his intervention that day could have tilted the balance against Blair . \nNever a man to lightly admit mistakes , I suspect Cook regretted that since . \nI suspect too he regretted not making up earlier with Brown . \nAs for Clare Short , why had she and Cook not coordinated their resignations prewar ? \nNeither has a convincing answer . \nHe made mistakes , yes , but Cook did his best to stop this government making the biggest mistake of all . \nThere seems little justice that he has parted the scene so early , depriving the critics of the Iraq war with their most principled - and practical - voice . \nJohn Kampfner is the editor of the New Statesman . \n"}
{"id": "89", "time": "2005-08-08", "text": "` Coruscating debater ' : Robin Cook . \nPhotograph : Martin Argles Robin Cook , who has died suddenly at the age of 59 , was one of the cleverest and most creative figures in modern British politics . \nHe devoted his entire career to the advancement of the Labor party and the pursuit of radical change within society . \nCook was one of the very few contemporary politicians whose national reputation was built principally within the chamber of the House of Commons . \nHe was a brilliant , coruscating debater whose most devastating performances combined lofty ridicule and forensic analysis in equal measure . \nIf Tony Blair was the Labor leader whom the Tories learned to fear in the country , Cook was the Labor frontbencher whom they had long since come to fear and loathe in the Commons . \nNobody contributed more , during the long years of opposition , to the rebuilding of morale , the restoration of Labor 's credibility as a potential party of government or the shredding of Tory reputations . \nCook was never much of an organiser on his own behalf , yet regularly topped the shadow cabinet poll of MPs during the opposition years . \nThis was an unpleasant process which involved much trading of blocks of votes , and the fact that Cook emerged in prime position simply reflected the fact that no MP with the slightest interest in advancing Labor as an effective opposition would have wished him to be anywhere but in the front line . \nCook 's intelligence and grasp of issues made him an impressive foreign secretary when Labor won the 1997 election , highly regarded on the international stage . \nHowever , it was inevitable that declaring the advent of an `` ethical foreign policy '' would invite constant efforts to find fault lines between rhetoric and reality , at the personal level as well as in his approach to issues . \nHe did not expect Tony Blair to move him from the job after the 2001 election , and was hurt both by the loss of that high office and the brutality of the execution . \nBut he adapted with elan to the relatively mundane post of leader of the house , and it is by no means the least of his epitaphs that he remains the only serious politician who has tried to replace the corrupting system of patronage which underpins the House of Lords with a democratic chamber . \nCook 's resignation from the cabinet over the second Iraq war in 2003 came at a time when his Lords reforms had run into the prime ministerial buffers . \nWhether he would have taken precisely the same position if he had remained as foreign secretary remains an open question . \nHaving decided to go , he did so with characteristic gravitas and style , pointedly declining to cross the line which separates honorable dissent from embittered treachery . \nCook had good reason to understand the poisonous realities of Saddam Hussein 's Iraq . \nAs foreign secretary , he presided over the enforcement of a sanctions regime which was specifically predicated on the need to contain Saddam 's efforts to develop weapons of mass destruction , as well as the enforcement of no-fly zones to limit the risk of renewed aggression . \nIt is often forgotten now that much of what became the anti-war lobby was equally opposed to these policies and that Cook was an object of their opprobrium . \nThe basis of his opposition to the invasion was that , essentially , nothing had changed and that the threat remained containable . \nIn his highly effective resignation speech , Cook asked : `` Why is it now so urgent that we should take military action to disarm a military capacity that has been there for 20 years and which we helped to create ? '' \nHe then provided his own answer : `` What has come to trouble me most over the past week is the suspicion that if the hanging chads in Florida had gone the other way and Al Gore had been elected , we would not now be about to commit British troops . '' \nThe same hanging chads had transformed the whole international environment and probably contributed to Cook 's departure from the Foreign Office . \nDuring the Clinton presidency , he was a statesman among friends and enjoyed a particularly warm and productive relationship with Madeleine Albright as US secretary of state . \nBut long before the supreme court finally handed George Bush his victory , the need to be in there first and friendliest with the anticipated new administration had become the overriding priority of British foreign policy . \nThat was not Cook 's natural instinct . \nRobert Finlayson Cook - known since schooldays as Robin - was born in Bellshill , Lanarkshire , the only child of a schoolteacher who became a headmaster . \nThough his father 's profession took them around Scotland and Robin 's schooling was in Aberdeen , there was a family background in Edinburgh , and it was there that he went to university , graduating with an honors degree in English Literature . \nIt was a period of notable turmoil in Edinburgh student politics , and Cook not only participated but observed as features editor of the newspaper Student -LRB- under the editorship of Duncan Campbell , now of the Guardian -RRB- . \nCook eschewed fashionable ultra leftism and ploughed into student Labor politics . \nHe was chairman of the Scottish Association of Labor Students in 1966-67 . \nAlthough Gordon Brown was several years younger , their careers overlapped from these early days , and so too did a friction which lasted more than 30 years , and only recently looked like being reconciled . \nIts precise origins , certainly by Cook 's own account , remained a mystery to him . \nAfter university , Cook became a lecturer with the Workers ' Educational Association , which allowed him to deepen his involvement in Edinburgh politics . \nHe was secretary of Edinburgh City Labor party from 1970 to 1972 , and became one of Scotland 's youngest councillors when he was elected to Edinburgh Corporation in 1971 at the age of 26 . \nPart of Cook 's strength lay in his widely acknowledged excellence - first as a councillor , and then as a constituency MP . \nHe served as chairman of Edinburgh 's housing committee , and was always assiduous in his attention to constituents ' problems . \nThis side of his political life may have conflicted with Cook 's national image , the prickly and somewhat aloof character - but the view among those he represented of a very approachable man who genuinely cared about resolving their problems was very much closer to the human reality . \nWhen Tom Oswald , the long-serving MP for Edinburgh Central , retired at the February 1974 general election , the bright and articulate young Cook was an obvious successor . \nHis positions were generally Tribunite , but the dominant issue in Scottish Labor politics during the 1970s defied left-right demarcations - it concerned the constitution , and specifically , how Scotland should respond to the oil-fuelled rise of nationalism . \nWhatever the basis for earlier disagreements with Brown might have been , there is no doubt that their respective positions in the run-up to the 1978 devolution referendum reinforced them . \nBrown had started to build his political reputation as an advocate of devolution . \nCook was one of its most articulate opponents , and when the Labor Vote No Campaign was founded , he became one of its vice-chairmen . \nThe referendum failed to deliver devolution , and was followed the next year by the fall of the Callaghan government when Margaret Thatcher 's Conservatives won the general election . \nBy the time of the next election , in 1983 , it was clear that the internal debate on devolution within the Labor party was effectively over . \nAs both a pragmatist and a democrat , Cook declared his support for a Scottish parliament in a television studio on election night , and became a convinced advocate of the reform . \nHe was also , throughout his career , an unswerving supporter of proportional representation , a doctrine now embraced by the Scottish parliament . \nLike many on the left in the early 1980s , Cook had to face up to the implications of Militant entryism and other threats to the Labor party 's very existence . \nIn the wake of boundary changes , he switched from Edinburgh Central to the new Livingston seat in advance of the 1983 election . \nTo his astonishment , he found himself opposed for the nomination by Tony Benn , who was at that time looking for a seat . \nCook prevailed comfortably and became a key player in the Kinnock , Smith and Blair reforms which made Labor electable . \nWith each frontbench post that he held in opposition , Cook 's stock rose . \nHe singlehandedly destroyed John Moore 's prospects of becoming Tory leader when , as health spokesman between 1987 and 1992 , he repeatedly took him apart in debates . \nProbably his greatest Commons triumph was in the 1996 debate on the Scott Report into arms for Iraq . \nFamously , Cook had only two hours access to the report before delivering the tour de force in which he described the Tory frontbench as `` limpets '' . \nGovernment is more difficult than opposition , and Cook 's FCO tenure was not short of its excitements . \nHis involvement in the ending of Serbian domination of Kosovo in 1999 was seen as successful . \nHe was embarrassed by appearing not to have been informed by local diplomats about the Sandline International group of mercenaries in Sierra Leone in 1998 , though ultimately took the view that there , the ends justified the means . \nOn the Queen 's visit to Pakistan and India in 1997 , he had to make it clear that , whatever he may have said privately , he had said nothing publicly about British mediation in the Kashmir dispute . \nHe gained great , if sometimes grudging , respect from the mandarins , but the challenges that he faced were compounded by the highly publicised upheavals in his private life , culminating in the break-up of his first marriage and his subsequent re-marriage to his former secretary , Gaynor Regan . \nIt is a measure of Cook 's competence and prestige , both as a national politician and in his constituency , that he continued to operate effectively and maintain political and public support , in the face of intense and continuing media interest . \nOut of office , Cook expanded his interests beyond politics . \nHis devotion to horses extended to all aspects of the equine world and not just his well-advertised love of the turf . \nHe wrote widely and well . \nBut he had not abandoned hope of a return to frontline politics . \nHe was without doubt one of the ablest and most interesting postwar Labor politicians , as well as the most effective parliamentarian of his generation . \nHis first wife , Margaret , whom he had married in 1969 , described him as an exemplary father , who because of his capacity for taking a moral stand found opposition easier than government . \nHe is survived by two sons , Peter and Christopher , from his first marriage , and by his second wife , Gaynor . \n"}
{"id": "78", "time": "2005-08-15", "text": "Followers split as 95-year-old guru ends meditation teaching in ` scorpion nation ' Monday 15 August 2005 13.08 BST You can do it in peace-loving nations such as Ireland and Holland . \nAnd , despite its record in Vietnam and Iraq , you can still do it in the United States . \nBut try meditating for a more enlightened Britain and you could find yourself accused of feeding `` the destroyer of the world . '' \nNearly 40 years after he first turned the Beatles on to transcendental meditation at his Indian ashram - sparking an upsurge of interest in his philosophy across the world - the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi has ordered his followers to stop teaching his advanced meditation and levitation techniques in Britain . \nDisgusted at Tony Blair 's support for the US in the Iraq war and the British electorate 's failure to unseat the prime minister at the general election , the 95-year-old guru says there is no point continuing to waste the `` beautiful nectar '' of TM on a `` scorpion '' nation . \n`` The good effects of transcendental meditation - increased creativity and long life - should not be given to a dangerous country that is constantly busy destroying the world , '' said the maharishi , speaking at one his regular press conferences in the Netherlands . \n`` TM is a gift from me to those who want to create peace and harmony in the world . '' \nAlthough the maharishi 's comments came before the July terror attacks on London , his declaration has divided followers in Britain and abroad concerned about his increasingly eccentric political views . \nIn recent years , the maharishi , who broadcasts on a private satellite channel from a converted monastery in Vlodrop , in Holland , has proffered opinions on everything from crime to the Israel-Palestine conflict to how countries can best foster military defense . \nIn the 1992 British general election his Natural Law party fielded 300 candidates in an attempt to win support for his `` age of enlightenment '' . \nGeorge Harrison agreed to a benefit concert at the Royal Albert Hall to launch the campaign , but not one Natural Law candidate held on to his deposit . \nUndeterred , last year the maharishi - known to his followers as `` his holiness '' and to his detractors as the `` giggling guru '' because of his habit of laughing in interviews - began despatching yogic flyers to the US , India , China and Brazil in an attempt to foster global peace by building a `` coherent world consciouness . '' \nAt the same time he ordered his followers at Skelmersdale , Lancashire - the site of an ideal maharishi village complete with a gold meditation dome - to beam peace-loving thoughts to the British electorate with the aim of overtuning the Labor government . \nIt was the failure of that thought experiment that prompted the maharishi to withdraw from Britain , a decision first communicated to his followers in a conference call from Holland the day after the general election . \n`` It has had quite a deep impact on our organization , '' acknowledged Geoffrey Clements , the former Natural Law candidate for Southport who also chairs the maharishi 's UK charity . \n`` But the maharishi explained to us that the poison in this country was so concentrated that he felt it was no use our continuing to nurture creativity and intelligence here . '' \nInstead , Dr Clements said teachers of TM and the maharishi 's more advanced TM-Sidhi program , in which devotees learn to use yoga to `` levitate '' , were being encouraged to take teaching positions in South Africa and at the Maharishi University in Fairfield , Iowa , a campus built on Vedic architectural principles that is home to around 2,000 TM devotees . \nBut other followers say they are astonished by the maharishi 's decison not to reject the US , particularly as last year he initiated a similar thought experiment there with the aim of defeating George Bush in a protest at his leading role in fomenting the Iraq war . \nWhile there is good scientific evidence that meditating twice a day can reduce stress and lower blood pressure , the maharishi 's detractors say that his claims that it can also cure cancer and prolong lifespans are unproven . \nThey also argue that at around # 1,300 for a standard TM introduction course , and more for the advanced TM-Sidhi program , the maharishi 's fees are excessive . \nBut the maharishi 's most questionable claim is that through concentrated meditation by small groups of yogic flyers his disciples can effect major changes on society via a phenomenon he calls the `` maharishi effect . '' \n`` In theory , you need ... about 8,000 people practising TM to effect more positive changes in -LRB- British -RRB- society , '' explains Dr Clements . \n`` But with the the more advanced TM-Sidhi program you can create the same levels of coherence with just 800 people . '' \nAccording to Dr Clements , between 1988 and 1991 100 TM-Sidhi practitioners meditating regularly at Skelmersdale were able to generate sufficient `` coherence '' in the local community to reduce crime on Merseyside by 16 % . \nBy the end of the experiment Merseyside had moved from the third highest crime area in the UK to the second lowest . \nTo generate a similar `` maharishi effect '' across the UK , however , Dr Clements said the Skelmersdale center would have needed much larger groups . \n`` Unfortunately , except for brief periods over last summer , we were n't able to create a critical mass , '' he said . \n`` That was a source of disappointment to the maharishi . \nThere was a measure of exasperation when he spoke to us in May because there is a large percentage of people in this country who have expressed their distaste for the government but in the end he came to the conclusion that the tradition of divide and rule in Britain was too deeply embedded . '' \nDr Clements , who last week attended a gathering in Holland of more than 1,500 followers of the maharishi to celebrate the organization 's golden jubilee , added that despite the maharishi 's decision , the mood of his British followers remained positive . \nHowever , Mike Owen , a psychotherapist with Sunabitur Healthcare , who has recommended TM to many of his patients , said that , for many , flying overseas was both impractical and prohibitively expensive . \n`` Whatever you think of the maharishi 's wilder theories , TM is a proven tool for reducing stress and anxiety , '' he said . \n`` It seems a shame to deprive ordinary people of that just because the maharishi considers our government bellicose and warlike . '' \nThe Yogi effect : Flying - or hopping - to a higher plane Transcendental meditation is a set of Hindu meditation techniques which supposedly brings practictioners to a higher state of consciousness characterised as `` enlightenment '' or `` bliss '' . \nThe method involves reciting a mantra , a secret expression unique to each practictioner . \nMore than 5 million people around the world - and almost 200,000 in the UK - have learned the technique since it was founded by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in 1957 . \nIn the early 1990s , television news programs featured clips of advanced TM practitioners , known as yogic flyers , apparently hovering off the ground while sitting in the lotus position . \nCloser inspection of the footage , however , showed that they were hopping , not flying . \nThe two best-known British advocates of TM are the former Tory party leader William Hague and the industrialist and broadcaster Sir John Harvey-Jones . \nSir John says TM has made him a much easier person to live with : `` I do n't make a drama out of a crisis . \nIf I gave it up now , my wife would leave me . '' \nThe Beatles song Sexy Sadie was originally called Maharishi , Maharishi , What Have You Done ? \nJohn Lennon wrote the song after becoming disillusioned when the maharishi allegedly made a pass at the actor Mia Farrow at his Indian ashram , but Lennon later changed the title at George Harrison 's instigation . \nThe lyrics read : `` Sexy Sadie what have you done\\/You made a fool of everyone .

\nIn the era of Gorbachev and Reagan , political will created treaties that still successfully control many types of WMD . \nRevived , they would provide the basis for global controls . \nIran must not be dealt with in isolation . \nAs the Iran debate unfolds , we will no doubt again hear about the joint intelligence committee . \nWe should follow the advice of a former head of the committee , Sir Paul Lever , to remove US intelligence officials from around the JIC table , where they normally sit . \nOnly in this way , argues Lever , can the British take a considered view themselves . \nWe need to be clear that our MPs have no mandate to support an attack on Iran . \nDuring the election campaign , the government dismissed any suggestion that Iran might be attacked as ridiculous scaremongering . \nIf Blair has told Bush that Britain will prevent Iran 's nuclear weapons `` come what may '' , we need to be equally clear that nothing short of an election would provide the mandate for an attack . \nDan Plesch is the author of The Beauty Queen 's Guide to World Peace , about which he is speaking at the Edinburgh Book Festival Letters for publication should be sent to : letters@guardian.co.uk If you need help using the site : userhelp@guardian.co.uk Call the main Guardian and Observer switchboard : Dan Plesch : How Bush would gain from war with Iran This article was published on guardian . \n"}
{"id": "219", "time": "2005-10-21", "text": "Friday 21 October 2005 15.24 BST A bill proposed by former cabinet minister Clare Short to force a vote in parliament before sending troops to war hit the parliamentary buffers today . \nDowning Street earlier said the legislation would have been impractical . \nAfter four hours of debate , the bill was `` talked out '' by Commons leader Geoff Hoon , meaning there will not be a vote on whether to refer it to the committee stage , the next step in a bill 's progress . \nThis in effect means the bill now stands no chance of becoming law . \nThe Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman , Sir Menzies Campbell , said : `` Parliament missed a rare opportunity to assert its authority over the executive . \n`` To send British troops into battle is the ultimate responsibility and it should be one for members of parliament . '' \nMs Short , who resigned shortly after the start of the Iraq war , today brought in a private member 's bill that would have curtailed the power of the prime minister to declare war without the backing of the House of Commons . \nUnder the bill , both the Commons and the Lords would have had to be shown the case for war and its legal justification before voting on whether to give the go-ahead . \nBut before MPs even finished debating the bill , No 10 said such a law could stop the government acting quickly and rob it of the crucial element of surprise . \nThe prime minister 's official spokesman also made clear there had been a vote ahead of action in Iraq . \n`` As the prime minister and the foreign secretary have both said on the record in the past , what you do not want to do is put yourself in a position where , for some reason you ca n't foresee at the moment , action has to take place very quickly , '' he said . \n`` Therefore you may not want to commit yourself to a position where you rob yourself of the element of surprise and give the enemy advance notice . '' \nBut in the chamber Ms Short insisted under her bill the PM would still have been allowed to take urgent action without approval but would be forced to pull the troops back if parliament then rejected the move . \nShe said her move had the backing of a large number of MPs from all parties as well as the families of soldiers killed in the conflict . \nMs Short said it was ridiculous that the power to wage war still officially lay with the monarchy as a royal prerogative - today exercised by the prime minister of the day . \nThe MP for Birmingham Ladywood pointed out that even if a prime minister decided to allow parliament a vote - as Tony Blair did over Iraq - he was free to ignore its decision . \nMs Short said her bill would have prevented the `` machinations and shenanigans '' over the withholding of the attorney general 's legal advice about the Iraq war . \nShe suggested that the powers in the hands of the prime minister could be used to justify moves to `` exaggerate '' a threat . \n`` Given the powers he has , the prime minister could argue that he was entitled to secretly commit us to war in April 2002 by giving his word to president Bush as has now been revealed by the leaking of the Downing Street memo . \n`` Similarly he could insist that he was entitled to exaggerate the intelligence and the threat of WMD , manipulate the legal advice and misreport the French position on the possible use of their veto in the security council because if the power to make war belongs to him and requires no approval from parliament , then he was entitled to do what he thought was right and then set out to persuade , in the way he found best , the cabinet , parliament and country to support the decision he had already made . '' \nThe bill 's sponsors included former Tory leader William Hague and Tory former chancellor Ken Clarke - although neither was in the chamber to hear the debate . \nBacking the bill , the Liberal Democrat David Heath said : `` It is our right as a parliament to disagree with the executive . \n`` If the executive can not command the support of the house then it has no business sending forces into conflict . '' \nGordon Prentice , a Labor MP , claimed the chancellor , Gordon Brown , was in favor of the bill . \nThe Tory MP Roger Gale also spoke up in favor of the bill , reminding MPs that the prime minister of the day was neither commander-in-chief nor head of state , as is the case with the US president . \nBut the Tory former shadow defense minister James Gray - who opposed the Iraq war - said he did not support the bill because `` only popular wars will be waged '' rather than `` unpopular but necessary '' wars . \n"}

'' \nHe went on to attack the `` flood '' of criminal justice legislation . \n`` Year after year , half-baked ideas are adopted in haste , puffed up to be the ideal solution and routinely abandoned a year later . '' \nHe agreed with his predecessor as Justice chairman , Lord Alexander of Weedon , that the Iraq war was unlawful and `` in its search for a justification in law for war the government was driven to scrape the bottom of the legal barrel '' . \nAnd , finally , the coup de grce : `` After the dreadful bombings in London we were asked to believe that the Iraq war did not make the world a more dangerous place . \nSurely , on top of everything else , we do not have to listen to a fairy tale . '' \nRetirement frees judges to speak their mind , but few have been so outspoken . \nAnd Steyn made headlines even as a serving judge . \nTake November 2003 , when the media picked up a lecture to lawyers in which he branded the US regime at Guantnamo Bay `` a monstrous failure of justice '' , and the system of trial by military tribunal `` a kangaroo court which makes a mockery of justice '' . \nHis words went round the world . \nTwo years before that , when Britain introduced executive detention without trial , his response was to deliver another of his trenchant lectures to lawyers and judges . \nHe expressed the view that the UK opt-out from the European convention on human rights , which the government had to do to bring in the legislation , was `` not , in the present circumstances , justified '' . \nIt was enough to get him removed , at the government 's insistence , from the panel of law lords hearing a challenge by Belmarsh detainees to the lawfulness of the opt-out . \nSteyn is a leading advocate of the principle that judges should not defer to parliament and ministers simply because politicians are accountable to the electorate . \nJudges too have a duty to the public , he argues , and should not simply take ministers ' word for it , but should probe and seek evidence . \nHis judgments had the same flavor . \nOf the extension of `` special advocates '' - who can see secret evidence but not discuss it with the `` client '' they represent , from terrorism to parole cases - he said : `` The special advocate procedure strikes at the root of the prisoner 's fundamental right to a basically fair procedure . '' \nHis reverence for the rule of law and basic human rights springs from his experience of growing up and practising as a lawyer in apartheid South Africa . \nThe son of an eminent law professor at Stellenbosch , he grew up a bookish child and went to Oxford as a Rhodes scholar . \nHe returned to South Africa and established a practice at the bar in 1958 , leaving in 1973 because of his opposition to apartheid . \nHe was surprised to be appointed a high court judge in 1985 by the Tory lord chancellor Lord Hailsham . \nHe wonders whether Hailsham got the wrong chap , because when they met later he repeatedly called him Charles . \nJeffrey Jowell , professor of public law at University College London , says that in the appeal court and Lords , Steyn 's judgments in cases involving prisoners and asylum seekers `` were paradigm shifts in thinking at the time '' . \nAnthony Lester , the human rights QC and Liberal Democrat peer , agrees . \n`` He has woven the Human Rights Act into the fabric of our legal system . \nHe has a terrier-like tenacity , deeply-held convictions and the courage of a lion . \nHe 's going to be extraordinarily difficult to replace .

'' \nThe SCIRI 's cleric leaders have strong ties to Iran 's theocracy and dominate the Shia bloc , which rules in coalition with the largely secular Kurds . \nSome analysts suggested the call for southern autonomy was a negotiating ploy to gain leverage for making Islam the main source of legislation . \nThe prospect of autonomy dismayed Sunni Arabs who fear being marginalised in the center of Iraq . \nSecular Shias and women 's rights advocates were more alarmed at the spectre of Islamic sharia law being imposed on a region stretching from Kerbala in the center to Basra in the south . \nNegotiators from Iraq 's main religious and ethnic groups have a deadline to agree a draft constitution by tomorrow , giving parliament until Monday to approve the text and submit it to voters for a referendum on October 15 . \nAll sides accept that Kurds will retain the autonomy they have enjoyed since the 1991 Gulf war . \nBut the drive to mirror that with autonomy for the south has encountered fierce opposition . \nSunnis fear that Iraq will disintegrate , or at least fracture , if Shias and Kurds control the oil wells and leave Sunnis with only the `` sands of Anbar '' , a vast , barren province . \n`` We hoped this day would never come , '' said Saleh al-Mutlak , a leading Sunni politician . \n`` We believe that the Arabs , whether Sunni or Shia , are one . \nWe totally reject any attempt to stir up sectarian issues to divide Iraq . '' \nSunnis were a dominant minority under the deposed president , Saddam Hussein , and Sunni militants are driving the insurgency . \nThe Shia prime minister , Ibrahim al-Jaafari , is keen to draw them into the political process , and this is one reason he opposes southern autonomy . \n`` The idea of a Shia region is unacceptable to us , '' his spokesman said yesterday . \nAfter decades of oppression under Saddam , Shia conservatives emerged after the United States-led invasion two years ago to impose Islamic rule on the south , closing alcohol shops , curtailing music and encouraging women to wear headscarves . \nHaving swept elections in January , conservatives boast a democratic mandate , but secular Shias and liberals say voters did not call for oppression and intolerance . \n`` We 're against federalism because we are against sharia . \nThat is our fear , '' said Ghareba Ghareb of the Iraqi Women 's Association . \nShe hoped a centralised Baghdad government would rein in militant clerics . \nUS officials have been pushing hard for the constitution deadline to be met , seeing the process as a way to quell the insurgency and reduce foreign troop levels . \nIf a draft constitution is agreed and passed in a referendum it will pave the way for elections in December . \nAs the deadline looms , negotiators are haggling over whether the Republic of Iraq should be renamed the Federal Republic of Iraq , the Islamic Republic or the Federal Islamic Republic . \nIraq 's al-Qaida group vowed yesterday to kill anyone involved in drafting the constitution . \nThe group , led by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi , says that sharia law should be the only legislation to govern Iraq . \n"}

'' \n-LRB- That 's very perceptive . -RRB- \nWe know that fighting during the US offensive in November 2004 destroyed three-quarters of the town of Falluja -LRB- population 360,000 -RRB- , killing hundreds of its inhabitants . \nThe objective of the operation was to cleanse the town of the terrorist bands acting as part of a `` Ba'athist conspiracy '' . \nBut we should recall that on June 16 2003 , barely six weeks after President Bush had claimed victory in Iraq , two reporters for the Knight Ridder newspaper group wrote this about the Falluja area : `` In dozens of interviews during the past five days , most residents across the area said there was no Ba'athist or Sunni conspiracy against US soldiers , there were only people ready to fight because their relatives had been hurt or killed , or they themselves had been humiliated by home searches and road stops ... One woman said , after her husband was taken from their home because of empty wooden crates which they had bought for firewood , that the US is guilty of terrorism . '' \nSoldiers who are set down in a country where they were told they would be welcomed as liberators and find they are surrounded by a hostile population become fearful and trigger-happy . \nOn March 4 nervous , frightened GIs manning a roadblock fired on the Italian journalist Giuliana Sgrena , just released by kidnappers , and an intelligence service officer , Nicola Calipari , whom they killed . \nWe have all read reports of US soldiers angry at being kept in Iraq . \nSuch sentiments are becoming known to the US public , as are the feelings of many deserters who are refusing to return to Iraq after home leave . \nIn May 2003 a Gallup poll reported that only 13 % of the US public thought the war was going badly . \nAccording to a poll published by the New York Times and CBS News on June 17 , 51 % now think the US should not have invaded Iraq or become involved in the war . \nSome 59 % disapprove of Bush 's handling of the situation . \nBut more ominous , perhaps , than the occupation of Iraq is the occupation of the US . \nI wake up in the morning , read the newspaper , and feel that we are an occupied country , that some alien group has taken over . \nI wake up thinking : the US is in the grip of a president surrounded by thugs in suits who care nothing about human life abroad or here , who care nothing about freedom abroad or here , who care nothing about what happens to the earth , the water or the air , or what kind of world will be inherited by our children and grandchildren . \nMore Americans are beginning to feel , like the soldiers in Iraq , that something is terribly wrong . \nMore and more every day the lies are being exposed . \nAnd then there is the largest lie , that everything the US does is to be pardoned because we are engaged in a `` war on terrorism '' , ignoring the fact that war is itself terrorism , that barging into homes and taking away people and subjecting them to torture is terrorism , that invading and bombing other countries does not give us more security but less . \nThe Bush administration , unable to capture the perpetrators of the September 11 attacks , invaded Afghanistan , killing thousands of people and driving hundreds of thousands from their homes . \nYet it still does not know where the criminals are . \nNot knowing what weapons Saddam Hussein was hiding , it invaded and bombed Iraq in March 2003 , disregarding the UN , killing thousands of civilians and soldiers and terrorising the population ; and not knowing who was and was not a terrorist , the US government confined hundreds of people in Guant namo under such conditions that 18 have tried to commit suicide . \nThe Amnesty International Report 2005 notes : `` Guant namo Bay has become the gulag of our times ... When the most powerful country in the world thumbs its nose at the rule of law and human rights , it grants a licence to others to commit abuse with impunity '' . \nThe `` war on terrorism '' is not only a war on innocent people in other countries ; it is a war on the people of the US : on our liberties , on our standard of living . \nThe country 's wealth is being stolen from the people and handed over to the super-rich . \nThe lives of the young are being stolen . \nThe Iraq war will undoubtedly claim many more victims , not only abroad but also on US territory . \nThe Bush administration maintains that , unlike the Vietnam war , this conflict is not causing many casualties . \nTrue enough , fewer than 2,000 service men and women have lost their lives in the fighting . \nBut when the war finally ends , the number of its indirect victims , through disease or mental disorders , will increase steadily . \nAfter the Vietnam war , veterans reported congenital malformations in their children , caused by Agent Orange . \nOfficially there were only a few hundred losses in the Gulf war of 1991 , but the US Gulf War Veterans Association has reported 8,000 deaths in the past 10 years . \nSome 200,000 veterans , out of 600,000 who took part , have registered a range of complaints due to the weapons and munitions used in combat . \nWe have yet to see the long-term effects of depleted uranium on those currently stationed in Iraq . \nOur faith is that human beings only support violence and terror when they have been lied to . \nAnd when they learn the truth , as happened in the course of the Vietnam war , they will turn against the government . \nWe have the support of the rest of the world . \nThe US can not indefinitely ignore the 10 million people who protested around the world on February 15 2003 . \nThere is no act too small , no act too bold . \nThe history of social change is the history of millions of actions , small and large , coming together at points in history and creating a power that governments can not suppress . \nHoward Zinn is professor emeritus of political science at Boston University ; his books include A People 's History of the United States A version of this article appears in the August issue of Le Monde diplomatique 's English language edition Mondediplo.com Letters for publication should be sent to : letters@guardian.co.uk If you need help using the site : userhelp@guardian.co.uk Call the main Guardian and Observer switchboard : Howard Zinn : My country is in the grip of a president surrounded by thugs in suits This article was published on guardian . \n"}

'' \nDeedy sought out grief counselling for herself and her family but , still a proud army wife , it took her months to do so . \n`` I do n't want this to be about being for or against the war , '' she tells the Guardian . \n`` My husband still has lots of friends and colleagues over there . \nBut I do n't want what happened to that girl to happen to anyone else . '' \nInge Colton is another widow who wishes she could escape Iraq , but every day when she turns on the television , listens to the radio , picks up a newspaper , it is right there in her face . \n`` It is not like he died of cancer or something , I see it every day and I am confronted with it every day . '' \nHer husband , Chief Warrant Officer Lawrence Colton , was killed on Easter Day last year when his Apache helicopter was shot down by a surface-to-air missile while responding to a distress call from a fuel convoy under attack . \nInge had heard from a friend that an Apache from Fort Hood , Texas , had been downed in Baghdad , and when she opened the door of their home to find the uniformed men on the doorstep she knew instantly why they were there . \n`` But I still closed the door on them ; I did not want to hear what they were going to tell me . \nWhen they knocked again I just said , ` Can you give me a second ? ' '' \nFor Inge , 41 , life will never be the same . \n`` Our country wants you to move on , but that is impossible because I live with it every day of my life . \nI get up in the morning and I put on makeup and make myself presentable , and people think I am getting back to normal . \nBut it 's a different kind of normal . \nI still cry every day . '' \nAccording to Karen Spears Zacharias , who has set up a grassroots network linked to the website heromama.org for widows and the 1,200 children who have lost parents in Iraq , there is better support from the military than there was during the Vietnam era , when her father was killed . \nBut too many widows unable or unwilling to ask for help are falling through the cracks . \n`` What 23-year-old girl is going to feel comfortable walking into a veterans center or military hospital for counselling ? \nThat 's like telling someone who lives 10 miles outside of town and who does n't own a car that there 's milk at the store - if they just go get it . \n`` People have said that suicide was Elaina 's choice and we should respect that . \nBut I do n't buy that . \nWhen you 're 23 years old and commit suicide it is not about choice but about being in an unhealthy place . \nWe have a responsibility to go beyond just saying that we will be there for them and really be there for them . '' \nShe adds : `` No one wants to talk about suicide because there is a feeling that we failed that person . \nBut we need to talk about it , we ca n't wait to have 10 more widows kill themselves before we address it . \nBecause right now it does n't feel like we are anywhere near the end of this war .

{"id": "21", "time": "2005-08-23", "text": "A declaration of war on this medieval royal prerogative Clare Short 's bill would bring conflict law in line with the modern world Tuesday 23 August 2005 00.08 BST From the strictly formal point of view , writes AJP Taylor in his Oxford History of England 1914-45 , Britain 's entry into the first world war was declared `` as though King George V still possessed undiminished the prerogatives of Henry VIII '' . \nA characteristically arresting thought . \nBut this is just the start . \n`` At 10.30 pm on August 4 1914 , '' Taylor continues , `` the king held a privy council at Buckingham Palace which was attended only by one minister and two court officials ... The cabinet played no part once it had resolved to defend the neutrality of Belgium ... Nor did the cabinet authorise the declaration of war . \nThe parliament of the United Kingdom , though informed of events , did not give formal approval to the government 's acts until it voted a credit of # 100 million , without a division , on August 6 . '' \nNor was this the end of the prerogative powers . \nThe governments and parliaments of Britain 's dominions were not consulted either . \nEach governor general proclaimed the war on his own authority - except in Canada , whose parliament , alone in the empire , voted its approval . \nOver 300 million African and Asian people across the globe were thus involved , without any consultation , `` in a war of which they understood nothing against an enemy who was also unknown to them '' , as Taylor puts it . \nThe past is another country . \nThey do things differently there . \nExcept , actually , they do n't . \nToday it may be impossible to imagine many things about the first world war occurring in anything like the same manner . \nThe suffering of the western front would not have lasted for a week in the age of the mobile phone or the human-rights lawyer , for example . \nBut the prerogative power to take the nation to war , central to the process of August 1914 , is still there almost unamended , as though nothing has changed since the late middle ages . \nThere is , of course , something of an exaggeration in this description . \nThe royal prerogative powers , already formal in 1914 , are even more formal today . \nDemocratic politics , at least as much as human-rights law , has transformed the political context not just of a decision to go to war but of all the residual prerogative powers . \nIn practice the government exercises these powers on the crown 's behalf . \nAnd in practice it will only do so if parliament does not object . \nNevertheless almost none of this is written down . \nIn principle , if not in practice , a prime minister could take the nation to war in defiance of a parliamentary vote ; he wields a theoretical power that a believer in the divine right of kings would have recognized . \nThroughout the 20th century these powers remained mostly uncontroversial and unchallenged . \nYet they persisted as the basis for war-making . \nIn September 1939 the declaration was reported by Neville Chamberlain to parliament as an accomplished fact . \nMPs did get the chance to vote on substantive motions on the Korean war in 1950 and the Gulf war in 1991 , but only after troops had been deployed and hostilities had begun . \nThe Iraq war in 2003 broke new constitutional ground in many ways , in particular because a British government for the first time allowed MPs a substantive vote on a war before it began . \nThis was in one sense a tactical response to governmental weakness , an implicit recognition that domestic politics required Tony Blair to obtain the authority of parliament for an exceptionally divisive conflict . \nBut it was also a response to a growing sense among constitutional reformers that the government 's exercise of this most powerful of prerogatives was now under greater question . \nThree months before the war , Blair debated this issue with the Commons liaison committee . \nHe agreed with the MPs that it would be right for parliament , and good for government , for there to be a vote . \n`` There is a right to vote , '' he even told the committee , before entering a caveat . \n`` The question is , do you take that one step further and get rid of the royal prerogative . \nI do not see any reason to change it , but I do really think that in the end it is more theoretical than real , this issue . '' \nIn practice , Blair said , `` I can not think of any circumstances in which a government can go to war without the support of parliament . '' \nArguably this was always the case . \nYet it is important to recognize that the nature of modern warfare has significantly increased the realism of Blair 's statement . \nIt is difficult to foresee the kind of total existential threat to the nation that British governments believed they faced in 1805 , 1914 or 1939 . \nThe wars that Britain is likely to fight in the 21st century are likely to be fought exclusively by professional forces , as part of an alliance , in the name of the international order rather than exclusively national interest , with real-time media coverage on both sides of the frontline , and in circumstances that cause minimal or no disruption at all to everyday life at home . \nThe longevity and adaptability of this country 's old war-making rules have been truly extraordinary . \nBut modern wars fought in modern democratic societies are increasingly posing new questions and demanding new rules , as the historic parliamentary vote in March 2003 over Iraq implied . \nThis is not to advocate change for change 's sake but to recognize that war-making in modern , rights-based societies requires new forms of legitimacy . \nWhich is one of several reasons why Clare Short 's private member 's bill requiring parliamentary approval for military action is both so interesting and so important . \nShort 's bill requires governments to do what the Blair government did voluntarily in 2003 . \nBut by explicitly removing war-making from prerogative powers and vesting that power in parliament , the bill goes significantly further . \nThe bill requires a government to set out a written political and legal justification of armed action . \nIf parliament does not approve , troops must not be committed . \nWhile allowing governments to embark on armed conflict in emergencies , the bill also gives MPs retrospective powers over emergency deployments . \nShort 's sponsorship will inspire some and provoke others . \nBut it would be petty to see the bill as an excuse to rerun old arguments about Iraq . \nFor this is , in the best sense , a modernizing measure . \nIt seeks to bring both the law of war and the system of public accountability for war-making abreast of modern realities . \nIt puts parliament in charge of the most important decision that any nation can ever take . \nFlaws the bill may have , but they can be ironed out in committee . \nThe bill 's second-reading vote in October will be a defining moment for all MPs who claim to be modernisers . \nAlready many big names in all parties have given their support . \nNot the least of those MPs was the late Robin Cook . \nIf all those tributes to Cook mean anything at all then the vote on October 21 will be a chance to turn those words into something lasting and practical in his memory . \n"}

'' \nQatar is unapologetically pro-US , which is unusual in a region where rulers often denounce Washington to domestic audiences . \nIt hosted US forces during the Iraq war . \nBut Washington objects to some of al-Jazeera 's coverage , including that of al-Qaida , the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and Iraq . \nHans Wechsel , regional director of the US state department 's Middle East partnership initiative , said : `` We have issues with them giving a platform to people who are calling for violence . \nIt 's not a matter of government interference , it 's strictly an issue of ethics . \nAfter all , we raise ethical concerns with journalists in the US too . '' \nBut Hafez al-Mirazi , an Egyptian who runs the channel 's Washington bureau , said : `` The US must know that the country hosting their airbase is not funding al-Qaida . \nThey just have a problem with us showing any civilian casualties in Iraq . '' \nMr Mirazi , who previously worked for Voice Of America , added : `` The White House has been spoilt by Fox News . \nThe current administration is unusually sensitive to any criticism . \nThe situation now is ` either you 're just like Fox , or you 're against us ' . '' \nSome say the station represents a big step forward for Arab democracy , which Washington advocates . \nMouafac Harb , director of al-Jazeera 's less popular US-funded rival , al-Hurra , said : `` Al-Jazeera has hijacked the role of the mosque as the primary source of information and views . \nAl-Jazeera is the only political process in the Middle East . '' \nIn a region where there is intense anti-US sentiment a private-sector al-Jazeera could well be more critical of the superpower . \nAt present the station invites US officials to put forward their point of view . \nHugh Miles , the author of Al-Jazeera : How Arab TV News Challenged The World , said : `` They have shown five hours of bin Laden 's speeches in total - and 500 hours of Bush .

{"id": "167", "time": "2005-04-27", "text": "What was the legal advice ? \nThree days before the first US missiles hit Baghdad , Lord Goldsmith , the attorney general , answered a question in the Lords on the legal basis for the use of military force . \nIn nine short paragraphs he set out his reasoning : that even without the `` second resolution '' UK diplomats had been frantically trying to secure , existing UN resolutions permitted an invasion . \nHis argument was that the security council 's authorisation for the 1991 Gulf war -LRB- resolution 678 -RRB- could be reactivated if Iraq were found to be in material breach of its ceasefire conditions -LRB- resolution 687 -RRB- . \nSince resolution 1441 , unanimously passed the previous November , stated that Iraq had not `` fully complied with its obligations to disarm '' , the authority to use force was automatically revived , Lord Goldsmith wrote . \nHis view was that if the resolution demanded another meeting of the security council to authorise war it would have said so . \nAll 1441 required , he wrote , was `` discussion by the security council of the Iraq 's failures '' . \nKey UN personnel including Kofi Annan , the secretary general , and Hans Blix , the chief weapons inspector , later disputed the legal status of the invasion under international law . \nPlenty of international lawyers also disagree with the reasoning of Lord Goldsmith 's nine paragraphs . \nTony Blair , the prime minister , insists the written answer of March 17 was a `` fair summary '' of the advice he was given and Lord Goldsmith said it was `` consistent '' with the longer document . \nBut leaked documents and disclosures suggest the full 13 pages Lord Goldsmith wrote for the prime minister 10 days before were more ambiguous . \nA summary of the advice , obtained by the Guardian and Channel 4 News , said resolution 1441 was `` capable in principle '' of reauthorising 678 -LRB- the gist of his written answer -RRB- but it added two qualifications omitted on March 17 . \nFirst , that the language of 1441 suggests `` differences of view within the -LRB- security -RRB- council '' on the legal impact of 1441 so the safest legal course would be to secure a second resolution . \nSecond , that the eventual argument he did deploy - the reactivation of 678 - would only be `` sustainable if there are strong factual grounds for concluding Iraq has failed to take the final opportunity '' to comply with the Gulf war ceasefire . \n`` In other words , '' read the summary of Lord Goldsmith 's advice to the prime minister , `` we would need to demonstrate hard evidence of non-compliance and non-cooperation . \nGiven the structure of the resolution as a whole , the views of Unmovic and the IAEA -LRB- the two UN weapons inspections authorities -RRB- will be highly significant in this respect . '' \nWhat were the views of the weapons inspectors ? \nHans Blix , the head of Unmovic , moved to the opinion that Iraq was beginning to comply with 1441 's call for it demonstrate it had disarmed . \nOn February 14 2003 he delivered a report to the security council listing examples of Iraqi compliance and questioning some of the US intelligence behind Colin Powell UN presentation on Saddam Hussein 's weapons programs . \nHe followed up on February 28 with a more mixed assessment but marked out Iraq 's commitment to comply with a deadline to destroy its illegal Samoud 2 missiles as a positive development . \nThe Swede 's final report to the council , delivered on March 7 , was also ambivalent but Mr Blix stressed the disarmament under way : `` We are not watching the destruction of toothpicks , '' he told the security council . \nMr Blix 's reports divided security council opinion . \nMarch 7 , the day Lord Goldsmith suggested a second resolution to authorise force would offer the `` safest legal course '' and the day of the final Unmovic report , was the day this second resolution became increasingly unlikely . \nJack Straw , the foreign secretary , proposed the UN set an ultimatum for Iraq to demonstrate `` full , unconditional , immediate and active cooperation '' by March 17 , but France made it clear it would veto such a resolution . \nBritain then proposed setting `` six tests '' for Iraq to meet if it was to avoid war . \nThe idea galvanised some diplomatic support but not enough to suggest Britain and the US could win a second resolution . \nOn March 12 , with the hope of a such a resolution fading , Admiral Sir Michael Boyce , chief of defense staff , asked the prime minister for an unequivocal statement on the legality of war under resolution 1441 . \nThe next day , Lord Goldsmith saw Lord Falconer and Baroness Morgan , two of Mr Blair 's closest advisers , at an unminuted Downing Street meeting , and expressed his `` clear view '' that war would be lawful under 1441 . \nDid Lord Goldsmith change his mind ? \nPrevious disclosures suggest he did . \nElizabeth Wilmshurst , deputy legal adviser to the Foreign Office , resigned in March 2003 because she did not believe war with Iraq was legal . \nHer letter setting out why said Lord Goldsmith `` gave us to understand '' he agreed with Foreign Office lawyers that the war was illegal without a new UN resolution but changed his advice twice just before the war to bring it in line with `` what is now the official line '' . \nThe summary certainly reveals doubts . \nThe attorney general says in conclusion that he could not be sure that if the `` reasonable case '' for reactivating 678 -LRB- the case that became the nine published paragraphs -RRB- ever came to court `` the court would agree with the view '' . \nThis detail - and the reference that the published argument was one he heard in Washington - appear to make for a tricky week ahead for the prime minister . \n"}

' '' \nThe citation for his VC reads : `` For his repeated extreme gallantry and unquestioned valor , despite intense direct attacks , personal injury and damage to his vehicle in the face of relentless enemy action , Pte Beharry deserves the highest possible recognition . '' \nBut Pte Beharry , who was accompanied to the palace by his wife , Lynthia , and his aunt Irene and uncle Raymond , played down his bravery . \n`` When I hear what I did , I ca n't really believe it was me . \nBut what I did was my choice - I knew I had to get everyone out because I would n't have been able to live with myself otherwise . \nI think it 's the training that just kicks in , '' he said . \nHe said celebrations had been put on hold during his recovery . \n`` There 's too much happening at the moment , '' he said . \n`` I never dreamt this would happen to me ; I never thought I 'd meet so many important people . \n`` I 'm still receiving treatment for my injuries - I 'm getting physio and seeing specialists - so I 'm limited in what I can do . \nI hope to return to service but I do n't know when that will be and I would go back to Iraq if I had to .

{"id": "88", "time": "2005-04-27", "text": "Ruined , cordoned Falluja is emerging as the decade 's monument to brutality Wednesday 27 April 2005 17.57 BST Robert Zoellick is the archetypal US government insider , a man with a brilliant technical mind but zero experience of any coalface or war front . \nSliding effortlessly between ivy league academia , the US treasury and corporate boardrooms -LRB- including an advisory post with the scandalous Enron -RRB- , his latest position is the number-two slot at the state department . \nYet this ultimate `` man of the suites '' did something earlier this month that put the prime minister and the foreign secretary to shame . \nOn their numerous visits to Iraq , neither has ever dared to go outside the heavily fortified green zones of Baghdad and Basra to see life as Iraqis have to live it . \nThey come home after photo opportunities , briefings and pep talks with British troops and claim to know what is going on in the country they invaded , when in fact they have seen almost nothing . \nZoellick , by contrast , on his first trip to Iraq , asked to see Falluja . \nA city of some 300,000 , which was alleged to be the stronghold of armed resistance to the occupation . \nTwo US attempts were made to destroy this symbol of defiance last year . \nThe first , in April , fizzled out after Iraqi politicians , including many who supported the invasion of their country , condemned the use of air strikes to terrorise an entire city . \nThe Americans called off the attack , but not before hundreds of families had fled and more than 600 people had been killed . \nSix months later the Americans tried again . \nThis time Washington 's allies had been talked to in advance . \nConsistent US propaganda about the presence in Falluja of a top al-Qaida figure , Abu Musab al-Zarqawi , was used to create a climate of acquiescence in the US-appointed Iraqi government . \nShia leaders were told that bringing Falluja under control was the only way to prevent a Sunni-inspired civil war . \nBlair was invited to share responsibility by sending British troops to block escape routes from Falluja and prevent supplies entering once the siege began . \nWarnings of the onslaught prompted the vast majority of Falluja 's 300,000 people to flee . \nThe city was then declared a free-fire zone on the grounds that the only people left behind must be `` terrorists '' . \nThree weeks after the attack was launched last November , the Americans claimed victory . \nThey say they killed about 1,300 people ; one week into the siege , a BBC reporter put the unofficial death toll at 2,000 . \nBut details of what happened and who the dead were remain obscure . \nWere many unarmed civilians , as Baghdad-based human rights groups report ? \nEven if they were trying to defend their homes by fighting the Americans , does that make them `` terrorists '' ? \nJournalists `` embedded '' with US forces filmed atrocities , including the killing of a wounded prisoner , but no reporter could get anything like a full picture . \nSince the siege ended , tight US restric tions - as well as the danger of hostage-taking that prevents reporters from traveling in most parts of Iraq - have put the devastated city virtually off limits . \nIn this context Zoellick 's trip , which was covered by a small group of US journalists , was illuminating . \nThe deputy secretary of state had to travel to this `` liberated '' city in a Black Hawk helicopter flying low over palm trees to avoid being shot down . \nHe wore a flak jacket under his suit even though Falluja 's streets were largely deserted . \nHis convoy of eight armored vehicles went `` so quickly past an open-air bakery reopened with a US-provided micro-loan that workers tossing dough could be glanced only in the blink of an eye , '' as the Washington Post reported . \n`` Blasted husks of buildings still line block after block , '' the journalist added . \nMeeting hand-picked Iraqis in a US base , Zoellick was bombarded with complaints about the pace of US reconstruction aid and frequent intimidation of citizens by American soldiers . \nAlthough a state department factsheet claimed 95 % of residents had water in their homes , Falluja 's mayor said it was contaminated by sewage and unsafe . \nOther glimpses of life in Falluja come from Dr Hafid al-Dulaimi , head of the city 's compensation commission , who reports that 36,000 homes were destroyed in the US onslaught , along with 8,400 shops . \nSixty nurseries and schools were ruined , along with 65 mosques and religious sanctuaries . \nDaud Salman , an Iraqi journalist with the Institute for War and Peace Reporting , on a visit to Falluja two weeks ago , found that only a quarter of the city 's residents had gone back . \nThousands remain in tents on the outskirts . \nThe Iraqi Red Crescent finds it hard to go in to help the sick because of the US cordon around the city . \nBurhan Fasa'a , a cameraman for the Lebanese Broadcasting Company , reported during the siege that dead family members were buried in their gardens because people could not leave their homes . \nRefugees told one of us that civilians carrying white flags were gunned down by American soldiers . \nCorpses were tied to US tanks and paraded around like trophies . \nJustin Alexander , a volunteer for Christian Peacemaker Teams , recently found hundreds living in tents in the grounds of their homes , or in a single patched-up room . \nA strict system of identity cards blocks access to anyone whose papers give a birthplace outside Falluja , so long-term residents born elsewhere can not go home . \n`` Fallujans feel the remnants of their city have been turned into a giant prison , '' he reports . \nMany complain that soldiers of the Iraqi national guard , the fledgling new army , loot shops during the night-time curfew and detain people in order to take a bribe for their release . \nThey are suspected of being members of the Badr Brigade , a Shia militia that wants revenge against Sunnis . \nOne thing is certain : the attack on Falluja has done nothing to still the insurgency against the US-British occupation nor produced the death of al-Zarqawi - any more than the invasion of Afghanistan achieved the capture or death of Osama bin Laden . \nThousands of bereaved and homeless Falluja families have a new reason to hate the US and its allies . \nAt least Zoellick went to see . \nHe gave no hint of the impression that the trip left him with , but is too smart not to have understood something of the reality . \nThe lesson ought not to be lost on Blair and Straw . \nEvery time the prime minister claims it is time to `` move on '' from the issue of the war 's legality and rejoice at Iraq 's transformation since Saddam Hussein was toppled , the answer must be : `` Remember Falluja . '' \nWhen the foreign secretary next visits Iraq , he should put on a flak jacket and tour the city that Britain had a share in destroying . \nThe government keeps hoping Iraq will go away as an election issue . \nIt stubbornly refuses to do so . \nVoters are not only angry that the war was illegal , illegitimate and unnecessary . \nThe treatment inflicted on Iraqis since the invasion by the US and Britain is equally important . \nIn the 1930s the Spanish city of Guernica became a symbol of wanton murder and destruction . \nIn the 1990s Grozny was cruelly flattened by the Russians ; it still lies in ruins . \nThis decade 's unforgettable monument to brutality and overkill is Falluja , a text-book case of how not to handle an insurgency , and a reminder that unpopular occupations will always degenerate into desperation and atrocity . \nJonathan Steele is the Guardian 's senior foreign correspondent ; Dahr Jamail is a freelance American journalist . \n"}
{"id": "119", "time": "2005-04-27", "text": "It is the duty of the young to go to the barricades for foolish causes , but today 's students would rather drink than demonstrate Wednesday 27 April 2005 01.50 BST At a recent Oxbridge dinner , I heard a college dean remark that he had taken part in two political demonstrations lately , one against the Iraq war and the other against the ban on foxhunting . \nBy contrast , it was some years since his students had marched further than the pub . \nWhen undergraduates were told about a forthcoming rent review , college authorities awaited a howl of outrage . \nInstead , to their amazement , the proposal was received with polite acquiescence . \nThis was not because the students in question are rich . \nRather , it is because few today are willing to rouse themselves to protest about anything at all . \nOur conversation about all this seemed comic . \nHere we were , a gathering of men and women of whom few were under 40 and most a good deal more , lamenting campus tranquillity . \nIt is fair to suggest that more anger was apparent at our dinner table about the shortcomings of Blair 's government , the Iraq war and WMD , than among a host of twenty-somethings in their rooms across the quad . \nEvidence suggests that this lack of student excitement is endemic , as it has been for a couple of decades . \nThere are pockets of activism . \nThe Iraq war prompted one huge spasm of protest in London , but this was exceptional . \nHow can we be surprised that the Apathy party is likely to prevail at this general election ? \nIf the best-educated section of British voters do not see any point in making a fuss , then why should millions living in relative economic contentment up and down the land ? \nReal anger today seems the privilege of a small metropolitan circle focused on the media , though characteristically many of its members kid themselves that they reflect popular views . \nI never thought I should hear myself , well , protesting , about student inertia . \nIn the 1960s and thereafter , when successive generations of long-haired weirdos seemed never to leave the streets , when a banner was a more important part of a student 's equipment than his library ticket , I was a cross little Conservative . \nMy kind watched in disdain as university faculty buildings were trashed , files ransacked , teachers abused . \nThere seemed a silliness about many protests , which attained its nadir in the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament . \nThe eagerness of Foots and Benns to offer a cry of anguish against their own society as a substitute for rational thought about the threat from the Soviet Union appeared pathetic . \nForty years on , it seems much easier than I found it then to recognize how important it is for the young to be angry about something - it does not much matter what . \nOld Jacob Bronowski , a 60s figure if ever there was one , was surely right when he wrote about university life in 1973 : `` It is important that students bring a certain ragamuffin , barefoot irreverence to their studies ; they are not here to worship what is known , but to question it . '' \nThis principle obviously extends beyond the lecture room , to life . \nToday , I feel a respect for the 60s protesters -LRB- if not for the decade 's violent extremists -RRB- that at the time I lacked the imagination to muster . \nTrue , they were often protesting for the fun of the game , rather than because they had thought coherently about the merits of the cause . \nTheir enthusiasm for Mao Zedong and Ho Chi Minh -LRB- no liberal democrat , he -RRB- was absurdly naive , as even Jane Fonda concedes . \nYet they were right that the Vietnam war was a barbaric American folly . \nIt was good that they shouted slogans and asked questions , because somebody had to . \nMaybe even the CND protesters contributed something , by articulating revulsion . \nThe wise men on both sides of the Atlantic knew that a nuclear conflict meant the end of civilisation , but we now know that some generals , on the American as well as the Soviet side , were occasionally tempted to think otherwise . \nAll this brings us back to today 's students . \nIt is said that they are too preoccupied with the struggle to prepare themselves to find jobs to have time for political frivolities . \nThese are the university kids whom Camille Paglia described contemptuously as `` an army of pedestrian , toadying careerists '' . \nI do not buy this line . \nEven if a minority are working harder than we ever did , most still have plenty of leisure . \nThey simply choose to spend it in different ways . \nThey would rather drink than demonstrate . \nThey are more passionate about sport than the fate of Iraq . \nIt seems bizarre to be promoting the cause of student activism . \nYet surely anyone who cares about British democracy should be bothered about our culture of acquiescence , not least in the re-election of a British prime minister who committed the nation to war on the basis of massive falsehoods , some of George Bush 's making but most of his own . \nWhere are the Peter Hains , Jack Straws , Tariq Alis ? \nWhere is the fierce , intolerant conviction that old men and women are getting it wrong , that it is time for a new generation to seize the levers ? \nThe excuse will not wash that life has become so serious that , for a student , self-preservation is all . \nIt seems more plausible that the young are succumbing to the material complacency that is paralysing the peoples of several western democracies , rendering them apparently unwilling to consider idealistic issues at all . \nThey profess some interest in the environment . \nThey want to save whales , but it is hard to imagine them renouncing the wares of Sony and Sanyo in the cause , as the Hains renounced apartheid sherry . \nThey are dismayed by horrors in Africa , but would rather spend Saturday afternoon watching Man U than demonstrating outside Downing Street about western supineness . \nThey shrug : what difference can we make ? \nYet the young are supposed to cherish vain hopes and go to the barricades for foolish causes . \nA world in which a college dean protests while his students swot in their rooms or head for the pub is topsy-turvy indeed . \nIt does not matter what they protest about , if they will only bestir themselves to become agitated about something . \nThey might even demonstrate against Peter Hain . \n"}
{"id": "348", "time": "2005-04-27", "text": "Conservative party co-chairman , Liam Fox , and shadow chief secretary to the treasury , George Osborne , unveil the latest Conservative campaign poster . \nPhotograph : Daniel Berehulak\\/Getty Michael Howard yesterday paved the way for a bitter end to the general election when the Tories launched a nationwide poster campaign explicitly condemning Tony Blair as a liar . \nIn an echo of the Conservatives ' notorious `` demon eyes '' of 1997 , the leadership unveiled a poster of a shifty-looking Mr Blair standing next to a stark message . \n`` If he 's prepared to lie to take us to war , he 's prepared to lie to win an election , '' it says in black lettering on a dark red background . \nIn a play on Labor 's latest message imploring people to vote for what they value , it adds : `` If you value the truth , vote for it . '' \nMr Howard was last night unapologetic about the poster , which includes language that would be ruled out of order in the House of Commons . \n`` I 'm a very direct person . \nI say it as it is , '' he said during a visit to Birmingham . \n`` Character is an issue at this election . \nIt is about trust . '' \nAt his morning press conference , Mr Howard defended his decision to describe the prime minister as a liar for three reasons : The so called `` dodgy dossier '' of February 2003 , which the prime minister claimed was based on intelligence but was in fact `` pulled off '' the internet ; The prime minister 's claim in September 2002 that intelligence about Iraqi weapons of mass destruction was `` extensive , detailed and authoritative '' when Lord Butler depicted it in his report last year as `` limited , sporadic and patchy '' ; The prime minister and Lord Goldsmith , the attorney general , had `` directly contradicted each other '' about advice on the legality of the Iraq war . \nThe poster is a gamble for Mr Howard - on the day after he admitted he was `` two goals down '' - because he was such an enthusiastic supporter of military action . \nBut he believes that voters across the spectrum , including opponents and supporters of the war , will share his belief that Iraq highlighted wider questions about the prime minister 's trustworthiness . \nOne aide said : `` Trust really is the fundamental issue . \nWar is the lightning conductor but he lied on top-up fees . \nSo Michael is saying you ca n't trust Labor on tax - because of the 66 stealth taxes - and you ca n't trust him on health because he said in 1997 there was 24 hours to save the NHS . \nCan you trust anyone who says that and then fails to deliver ? '' \nLabor will have mixed feelings about the poster because the prime minister needs no reminding that anger about Iraq has made him one of the party 's main liabilities . \nBut Labor strategists believe the Tories ' decision to attack him in such personal terms shows Mr Howard `` has nothing to say '' about the voters ' main concerns on schools and hospitals . \nIn a sign that the Tories are embarking on a negative end to the campaign , one of Australia 's toughest political operators has flown in to help the party . \nMark Textor , who has allegedly deployed the US tactic of `` push polling '' to spread damaging information about opponents under the guise of questions , was photographed by the Labor party entering Tory HQ . \nThe Conservatives said they had never hidden the fact that Mr Textor , a business partner of the party 's Australian campaign director , Lynton Crosby , would help out . \n"}
{"id": "30", "time": "2005-07-07", "text": "So , Mr Bremer , where did all the money go ? \nAt the end of the Iraq war , vast sums of money were made available to the US-led provisional authorities , headed by Paul Bremer , to spend on rebuilding the country . \nBy the time Bremer left the post eight months later , $ 8.8 bn of that money had disappeared . \nEd Harriman on the extraordinary scandal of Iraq 's missing billions When Paul Bremer , the American pro consul in Baghdad until June last year , arrived in Iraq soon after the official end of hostilities , there was $ 6bn left over from the UN Oil for Food Programme , as well as sequestered and frozen assets , and at least $ 10bn from resumed Iraqi oil exports . \nUnder Security Council Resolution 1483 , passed on May 22 2003 , all these funds were transferred into a new account held at the Federal Reserve Bank in New York , called the Development Fund for Iraq -LRB- DFI -RRB- , and intended to be spent by the Coalition Provisional Authority -LRB- CPA -RRB- `` in a transparent manner ... for the benefit of the Iraqi people '' . \nThe US Congress also voted to spend $ 18.4 bn of US taxpayers ' money on the redevelopment of Iraq . \nBy June 28 last year , however , when Bremer left Baghdad two days early to avoid possible attack on the way to the airport , his CPA had spent up to $ 20bn of Iraqi money , compared with $ 300m of US funds . \nThe `` reconstruction '' of Iraq is the largest American-led occupation program since the Marshall Plan - but the US government funded the Marshall Plan . \nDefense secretary Donald Rumsfeld and Paul Bremer have made sure that the reconstruction of Iraq is paid for by the `` liberated '' country , by the Iraqis themselves . \nThe CPA maintained one fund of nearly $ 600m cash for which there is no paperwork : $ 200m of it was kept in a room in one of Saddam 's former palaces . \nThe US soldier in charge used to keep the key to the room in his backpack , which he left on his desk when he popped out for lunch . \nAgain , this is Iraqi money , not US funds . \nThe `` financial irregularities '' described in audit reports carried out by agencies of the American government and auditors working for the international community collectively give a detailed insight into the mentality of the American occupation authorities and the way they operated . \nTruckloads of dollars were handed out for which neither they nor the recipients felt they had to be accountable . \nThe auditors have so far referred more than a hundred contracts , involving billions of dollars paid to American personnel and corporations , for investigation and possible criminal prosecution . \nThey have also discovered that $ 8.8 bn that passed through the new Iraqi government ministries in Baghdad while Bremer was in charge is unaccounted for , with little prospect of finding out where it has gone . \nA further $ 3.4 bn appropriated by Congress for Iraqi development has since been siphoned off to finance `` security '' . \nAlthough Bremer was expected to manage Iraqi funds in a transparent manner , it was only in October 2003 , six months after the fall of Saddam , that an International Advisory and Monitoring Board -LRB- IAMB -RRB- was established to provide independent , international financial oversight of CPA spending . \n-LRB- This board includes representatives from the United Nations , the World Bank , the IMF and the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development . -RRB- \nThe IAMB first spent months trying to find auditors acceptable to the US . \nThe Bahrain office of KPMG was finally appointed in April 2004 . \n`` KPMG has encountered resistance from CPA staff regarding the submission of information required to complete our procedures , '' they wrote in an interim report . \n`` Staff have indicated ... that cooperation with KPMG 's undertakings is given a low priority . '' \nKPMG had one meeting at the Iraqi Ministry of Finance ; meetings at all the other ministries were repeatedly postponed . \nThe auditors even had trouble getting passes to enter the Green Zone . \nThere appears to have been good reason for the Americans to stall . \nAt the end of June 2004 , the CPA would be disbanded and Bremer would leave Iraq . \nThere was no way the Bush administration would want independent auditors to publish a report into the financial propriety of its Iraqi administration while the CPA was still in existence and Bremer at its head still answerable to the press . \nSo the report was published in July . \nThe auditors found that the CPA did n't keep accounts of the hundreds of millions of dollars of cash in its vault , had awarded contracts worth billions of dollars to American firms without tender , and had no idea what was happening to the money from the Development Fund for Iraq -LRB- DFI -RRB- , which was being spent by the interim Iraqi government ministries . \nThis lack of transparency has led to allegations of corruption . \nAn Iraqi hospital administrator told me that when he came to sign a contract , the American army officer representing the CPA had crossed out the original price and doubled it . \nThe Iraqi protested that the original price was enough . \nThe American officer explained that the increase -LRB- more than $ 1m -RRB- was his retirement package . \nWhen the Iraqi Governing Council asked Bremer why a contract to repair the Samarah cement factory was costing $ 60m rather than the agreed $ 20m , the American representative reportedly told them that they should be grateful the coalition had saved them from Saddam . \nIraqis who were close to the Americans , had access to the Green Zone or held prominent posts in the new government ministries were also in a position personally to benefit enormously . \nIraqi businessmen complain endlessly that they had to offer substantial bribes to Iraqi middlemen just to be able to bid for CPA contracts . \nIraqi ministers ' relatives got top jobs and fat contracts . \nFurther evidence of lack of transparency comes from a series of audits and reports carried out by the CPA 's own inspector general 's office -LRB- CPAIG -RRB- . \nSet up in January 2004 , it reports to Congress . \nIts auditors , accountants and criminal investigators often found themselves sitting alone at cafe tables in the Green Zone , shunned by their CPA compatriots . \nTheir audit , published in July 2004 , found that the American contracts officers in the CPA and Iraqi ministries `` did not ensure that ... contract files contained all the required documents , a fair and reasonable price was paid for the services received , contractors were capable of meeting delivery schedules , or that contractors were paid in accordance with contract requirements '' . \nMillions of dollars in cash went missing from the Iraqi Central Bank . \nBetween $ 11m and $ 26m worth of Iraqi property sequestered by the CPA was unaccounted for . \nThe payroll was padded with hundreds of ghost employees . \nMillions of dollars were paid to contractors for phantom work . \nSome $ 3,379,505 was billed , for example , for `` personnel not in the field performing work '' and `` other improper charges '' on just one oil pipeline repair contract . \nMost of the 69 criminal investigations the CPAIG instigated related to alleged theft , fraud , waste , assault and extortion . \nIt also investigated `` a number of other cases that , because of their sensitivity , can not be included in this report '' . \nOne such case may have arisen when 19 billion new Iraqi dinars , worth about # 6.5 m , was found on a plane in Lebanon that had been sent there by the American-appointed Iraqi interior minister . \nAt the same time , the IAMB discovered that Iraqi oil exports were unmetered . \nNeither the Iraqi State Oil Marketing Organisation nor the American authorities could give a satisfactory explanation for this . \n`` The only reason you would n't monitor them is if you do n't want anyone else to know how much is going through , '' one petroleum executive told me . \nOfficially , Iraq exported $ 10bn worth of oil in the first year of the American occupation . \nChristian Aid has estimated that up to $ 4bn more may have been exported and is unaccounted for . \nIf so , this would have created an off-the-books fund that both the Americans and their Iraqi allies could use with impunity to cover expenditures they would rather keep secret - among them the occupation costs , which were rising far beyond what the Bush administration could comfortably admit to Congress and the international community . \nIn the few weeks before Bremer left Iraq , the CPA handed out more than $ 3bn in new contracts to be paid for with Iraqi funds and managed by the US embassy in Baghdad . \nThe CPA inspector general , now called the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction -LRB- Sigir -RRB- , has just released an audit report on the way the embassy has dealt with that responsibility . \nThe auditors reviewed the files of 225 contracts totalling $ 327m to see if the embassy `` could identify the current value of paid and unpaid contract obligations '' . \n`` Our review showed that financial records ... understated payments made by $ 108,255,875 '' and `` overstated unpaid obligations by $ 119,361,286 '' . \nThe auditors also reviewed the paperwork of a further 300 contracts worth $ 332.9 m : `` Of 198 contract files reviewed , 154 did not contain evidence that goods and services were received , 169 did not contain invoices , and 14 did not contain evidence of payment . '' \nClearly , the Americans see no need to account for spending Iraqis ' national income now any more than they did when Bremer was in charge . \nNeither the embassy chief of mission nor the US military commander replied to the auditors ' invitation to comment . \nInstead , the US army contracting commander lamely pointed out that `` the peaceful conditions envisioned in the early planning continue to elude the reconstruction efforts '' . \nThis is a remarkable understatement . \nIt 's also an admission that Americans ca n't be expected to do their sums when they are spending other people 's money to finance a war . \nLack of accountability does not stop with the Americans . \nIn January this year , the Sigir issued a report detailing evidence of fraud , corruption and waste by the Iraqi Interim Government when Bremer was in charge . \nThey found that $ 8.8 bn - the entire Iraqi Interim Government spending from October 2003 through June 2004 - was not properly accounted for . \nThe Iraqi Office of Budget and Management at one point had only six staff , all of them inexperienced , and most of the ministries had no budget departments . \nIraq 's newly appointed ministers and their senior officials were free to hand out hundreds of millions of dollars in cash as they pleased , while American `` advisers '' looked on . \n`` CPA personnel did not review and compare financial , budgetary and operational performance to planned or expected results , '' the auditors explained . \nOne ministry gave out $ 430m in contracts without its CPA advisers seeing any of the paperwork . \nAnother claimed to be paying 8,206 guards , but only 602 could be found . \nThere is simply no way of knowing how much of the $ 8.8 bn has gone to pay for private militias and into private pockets . \n`` It 's remarkable that the inspector general 's office could have produced even a draft report with so many misconceptions and inaccuracies , '' Bremer said in his reply to the Sigir report . \n`` At liberation , the Iraqi economy was dead in the water . \nSo CPA 's top priority was to get the economy going . '' \nThe Sigir has responded by releasing another audit this April , an investigation into the way Bremer 's CPA managed cash payments from Iraqi funds in just one part of Iraq , the region around Hillah : `` During the course of the audit , we identified deficiencies in the control of cash ... of such magnitude as to require prompt attention . \nThose deficiencies were so significant that we were precluded from accomplishing our stated objectives . '' \nThey found that CPA headquarters in Baghdad `` did not maintain full control and accountability for approximately $ 119.9 m '' , and that agents in the field `` can not properly account for or support over $ 96.6 m in cash and receipts '' . \nThe agents were mostly Americans in Iraq on short-term contracts . \nOne agent 's account balance was `` overstated by $ 2,825,755 , and the error went undetected '' . \nAnother agent was given $ 25m cash for which Bremer 's office `` acknowledged not having any supporting documentation '' . \nOf more than $ 23m given to another agent , there are only records for $ 6,306,836 paid to contractors . \nMany of the American agents submitted their paperwork only hours before they headed to the airport . \nTwo left Iraq without accounting for $ 750,000 each , which has never been found . \nCPA head office cleared several agents ' balances of between $ 250,000 and $ 12m without any receipts . \nOne agent who did submit receipts , on being told that he still owed $ 1,878,870 , turned up three days later with exactly that amount . \nThe auditors thought that `` this suggests that the agent had a reserve of cash '' , pointing out that if his original figures had been correct , he would have accounted to the CPA for approximately $ 3.8 m more than he had been given in the first place , which `` suggests that the receipt documents provided to the DFI account manager were unreliable '' . \nSo where did the money go ? \nYou ca n't see it in Hillah . \nThe schools , hospitals , water supply and electricity , all of which were supposed to benefit from these funds , are in ruins . \nThe inescapable conclusion is that many of the American paying agents grabbed large bundles of cash for themselves and made sweet deals with their Iraqi contacts . \nAnd so it continues . \nThe IAMB 's most recent audit of Iraqi government spending talks of `` incomplete accounting '' , `` lack of documented justification for limited competition for contracts at the Iraqi ministries '' , `` possible misappropriation of oil revenues '' , `` significant difficulties in ensuring completeness and accuracy of Iraqi budgets and controls over expenditures '' and `` non-deposit of proceeds of export sales of petroleum products into the appropriate accounts in contravention of UN Security Council Resolution 1483 '' . \nIn the absence of any meaningful accountability , Iraqis have no way of knowing how much of the nation 's wealth is being used for reconstruction and how much is being handed out to ministers ' and civil servants ' friends and families or funnelled into secret overseas bank accounts . \nGiven that many Ba'athists are now back in government , some of that money may even be financing the insurgents . \nBoth Saddam and the US profited handsomely during his reign . \nHe controlled Iraq 's wealth while most of Iraq 's oil went to Californian refineries to provide cheap petrol for American voters . \nUS corporations , like those who enjoyed Saddam 's favor , grew rich . \nToday , the system is much the same : the oil goes to California , and the new Iraqi government spends the national wealth with impunity . \nBremer maintained one slush fund of nearly $ 600m in cash for which there is no paperwork : $ 200m of it was kept in a room in one of Saddam 's former palaces 19 billion new Iraqi dinars , worth about # 6.5 m , was found on a plane in Lebanon that had been sent there by the new Iraqi interior minister One ministry claimed to be paying 8,206 guards , but only 602 could be found One American agent was given $ 23m to spend on restructuring ; only $ 6m is accounted for This is an edited version of an article that appears in the current issue of the London Review of Books -LRB- lrb -RRB- . \nThis article appeared on p1 of the G2 section of the Guardian on 00.35 BST on Thursday 7 July 2005 Follow all the top stories of the day on Twitter with the Guardian 's world news team john_hooper : #Benedict decided to resign after visit to Mexico & Cuba last March , says tonight 's edition of #pope 's daily L'Osservatore Romano #news \n"}

'' \nMr Talabani gave no details about when or where the victims were abducted or found , saying only that the interim prime minister , Ayad Allawi , would deal with the matter . \nHowever , he provided the information in response to a question about the search for hostages reportedly seized from the Madaen region , south of Baghdad . \nShia leaders and government officials claimed last week that Sunni militants had abducted as many as 100 Shia residents from the area , but when Iraqi forces moved into Madaen , they found no captives . \nLater , Shia officials said that dozens of bodies had been found in the Tigris river south of Madaen , but residents and police in the area who spoke to the Reuters news agency said they had not seen any bodies . \nToday Mr Talabani insisted : `` It is not true that there were no hostages . \nThere were , but they were killed and they threw the bodies into the Tigris . '' \nMeanwhile , residents said they had found the bullet-ridden bodies of 19 Iraqi men in a soccer stadium in Haditha , a town 140 miles north of Baghad . \nUsama Rauf and Ousama Halim , both taxi drivers , said they heard gunshots and rushed to the stadium where they saw the bodies lined up against a bloodstained wall . \nAn Iraqi reporter and other residents counted 19 bodies and said all of them appeared to have been shot . \nResidents said they believed the victims , all men in civilian clothes , were soldiers abducted by insurgents as they headed home for tomorrow 's holiday marking the birthday of the prophet Muhammad . \nWalid al-Hadithi , a doctor in the town 's hospital , told Reuters that the murders followed clashes in the area between national guardsmen , US troops and rebels . \nUS forces said they were investigating , and Iraqi military officials said they had no immediate information . \n"}

'' \nIt was an exclamation more than a statement . \nThis was indeed Marla , a 25-year-old Californian with no satellite phone , very little cash , a shoestring organization and an impossible mission , but any anxieties she may have felt were concealed by a toothy grin . \nIt was December 2001 . \nShe had come , she said , to document civilian casualties of the recently concluded US-led campaign to oust the Taliban . \nShe not only wanted to find them - difficult enough amid lawless chaos - she wanted Washington to compensate them , to take responsibility for mistakes in its post-September 11 offensive . \nIt was easy , at first , to patronise and belittle , and many reporters did . \nShe gushed and fawned and giggled . \nEverything seemed either cool or awesome . \nShe complained about broken nails , wondered whether the market on Chicken Street sold conditioner and asked about parties . \nPlanet Marla was located in a parallel , ditzy universe . \nAfter rising at 4am one morning , the hotel dark and slumbering , I was taken aback to see Bubbles , as she had been nicknamed , waiting in the corridor . \n`` Thanks for letting me come . '' \nI had n't mentioned the trip , nor invited her , but she wedged between a colleague and me for the ride to Qalaye Niazi , a village recently attacked by American bombers on the grounds it harboured fugitive members of the Taliban and al-Qaida . \nThe Pentagon had claimed a clean hit with no collateral damage , but amid the debris were bloodied children 's shoes , the scalp of a woman with braided gray hair , and wedding decorations . \nSurvivors said dozens of men , women and children had died . \nMarla wrote it all down , asked lots of questions and returned to Kabul silent and thoughtful . \nLast Saturday , almost three and a half years later , a journey which started in the Afghan winter ended on a balmy spring afternoon in Baghdad . \nA suicide car bomber attacked a convoy of SUVs on the airport road . \nMarla Ruzicka and her colleague Faiz Al Salaam , 43 , were separate from the convoy but their ordinary car took the force of the blast , killing them both . \nShe had summoned the foreign press corps to a party that night at the Hamra hotel and her failure to show was our first inkling that something was wrong . \nThe next morning the deaths were confirmed . \nMarla suffered burns to 90 % of her body . \nA medic who treated her at the scene reported her last words : `` I 'm alive . '' \nHer friends , a global community since she befriended pretty much everyone she met , are stunned . \nThere is a hush around the Hamra hotel , low-voiced huddles swapping Marla stories . \nThe best is one that relates how she came to be taken seriously , touched countless lives and changed US policy . \n`` Everyone who met Marla was struck by her incredible effervescence and commitment , '' said Kenneth Roth , executive director of Human Rights Watch . \n`` She was courageous and relentless in pursuit of accurate information about civilians caught up in war . '' \nSenator Patrick Leahy , a Vermont Democrat , said it was Marla 's idea to put a special fund in last year 's foreign aid bill to compensate Iraqis whose businesses had been bombed by mistake . \n`` Just from the force of her personality , we decided to take a chance on it . '' \nLeahy said $ 10m was added to the foreign aid bill last year and another $ 10m had been set aside for next year . \nA memorial will be held in Washington this week and the senator will pay tribute from the Senate floor . \n`` I said to her father this morning : ' A lot of people spend their whole lives and do not begin to accomplish what she 's done . ' '' \nIt is not difficult to reconcile Bubbles of Kabul with the human rights heroine whose face has filled newspapers and television screens during the past few days . \nMarla did not change . \nThe lobbying grew more polished and sophisticated but she was as bubbly at the beginning as the end . \nWhat changed was that powerful people took notice . \nShe was born in Lakeport , near San Francisco , with her twin brother Mark the youngest of six children of Clifford and Nancy Ruzicka , middle-class Republicans . \nShe was suspended for leading a school protest against the first Gulf war and as a student at Long Island University visited Cuba , Guatemala , Costa Rica and Israel , including Palestinian areas . \nPolice carted her away when she whipped off a sarong with a protest slogan at a speech by George Bush , then governor of Texas . \nOn behalf of Global Exchange , a San Francisco-based advocacy group that is run by Medea Benjamin , she visited Afghanistan in 2001 to document cases of wounded and bereaved civilians . \nThe US government was not counting them and much of the media and other human rights groups balked at visiting remote , dangerous areas to interview survivors . \nSome of us called it Marla 's mad mission . \nAfter a break I returned to Kabul in April 2002 and found the wide-eyed wonder of December transformed into a networking queen who knew all the journalists , peacekeepers , aid workers and politicians . \nShe had lured Bianca Jagger to the capital . \nMarla would totter around parties in heels and slinky dresses , vodka in hand , making introductions . \nThe socialising bordered on the frenzied and sometimes ended with Marla slumped , but not before the room had been worked for anything useful for an unofficial survey which confirmed 824 dead . \nThe US embassy loathed Marla , not least for the day she assembled dozens of mostly Pashtun tribesmen , some bandaged and limping , in front of its walls to demand compensation . \nThe stunt received wide coverage . \nMarla was becoming a media star , popping up on CNN and becoming the subject of a biography . \nPublicity for the cause , she said , relishing the attention . \nBoyfriends came and went , but she often hinted at loneliness . \nIn a recent online journal entry she wrote : `` I am young , and new at this and developing ways to cope , but in honesty I have tried red wine a little too much for medicine , deprived myself of sleep and felt extremely inadequate . '' \nThe furious energy never abated . \nLobbying , traveling , kickboxing and partying were her therapy . \nAfter Afghanistan she founded her own NGO , the Campaign for Innocent Victims in Conflict -LRB- Civic -RRB- , rented an office in Washington DC and forged ties with congressmen such as Leahy . \nWhen Donald Rumsfeld testified at a Senate hearing , she engaged him on his way out and quietly made her case , figuring it would be more effective than protesting . \nShe was in Baghdad for the March 2003 invasion and mobilised 150 volunteers to visit hospitals and attempt to make the first proper list of people killed or injured by US forces . \nTheir total of more than 2,000 dead formed the basis for subsequent estimates which touched 20,000 . \nFor a time she stayed at the Guardian house before worsening security forced her and the correspondents into the Hamra hotel . \nCounting became a means to gain attention and help for casualties who would otherwise be ignored . \nIn an essay sent to Human Rights Watch shortly before she died , Marla wrote : `` A number is important not only to quantify the cost of the war , but to me each number is also a story of someone whose hopes , dreams and potential will never be realized , and who left behind a family . '' \nSome Iraqis were bemused by the blonde who would burst from a black ankle-length abaya , worn to disguise herself as a local , hugging and kissing their children , but she won the respect of families who were given the hope of financial and medical aid . \nIt would not have been possible without Faiz Al Salaam , a commercial pilot with Iraq Air who had become Marla 's driver , fixer and translator . \nA witty , urbane man , he recently became a father and hinted at quitting his perilous sideline . \nLast June , Marla wrote about the airport road in her online journal : `` The ride is not pleasant . \nMilitary convoys passing every moment . \nFaiz and I hold our breath . '' \nThe target of Saturday 's attack appears to have been a convoy of civilian contractors who happened to be passing the couple when the bomber struck . \nWitnesses described the car of Faiz and Marla bursting into flames . \nA French national also died and six people were injured . \nFaiz 's relatives identified Marla 's body but have yet to retrieve his corpse , possibly because it was so badly damaged . \nFriends had advised Marla against returning to Baghdad . \nBut the 28-year-old said she needed to collect fresh stories for fundraising and so checked back into the Hamra last month , bearing cheese , chocolate and cigars for fellow guests . \nShe knocked on the doors of the few people she did not know . \nI 'm Marla ! '' \nHelping the relatives of an infant whose parents were killed when their vehicle was hit by what was believed to be an American rocket became a particular passion . \nShe praised individual US commanders for wanting to do the right thing but complained about bureaucratic obstacles . \nLast Friday , Marla left a telephone message to her parents : `` Mom and Dad , I love you . \nI 'm OK . '' \nHer mother , Nancy , said they were worried but knew better than to tell their children to do anything . \n`` We were supportive and just reminded her to be careful . '' \nAt a Marla-instigated gathering that same night , her last , she was in her element , taking people aside for chats , raving about the food and promising to quit smoking any minute . \nTo my eyes she had not aged a day since Kabul but she batted away the remark . \nSomething about the air in Baghdad dried the skin , she said , rubbing her temples . \n`` Once I hit 30 I 'm going to get old really quickly . '' \nThe thought struck her as funny and she laughed . \nLike a MacBook Pro '' says @Mister_Solomon : Westminster Dog Show - live ! \n"}
{"id": "190", "time": "2005-07-31", "text": "Rome captive ` says Iraq sparked plot ' Security chiefs fear new wave of assaults Huge hunt for bomb mastermind Death gangs were linked , say police One of the men accused of taking part in the failed terror attacks in London on 21 July has claimed the bomb plot was directly inspired by Britain 's involvement in the Iraq war . \nIn a remarkable insight into the motives behind the alleged would-be bombers , Hussain Osman , arrested in Rome on Friday , has revealed how the suspects watched hours of TV footage showing grief-stricken Iraqi widows and children alongside images of civilians killed in the conflict . \nHe is alleged to have told prosecutors that after watching the footage : ` There was a feeling of hatred and a conviction that it was necessary to give a signal - to do something . ' \nBut some of the Italian media reports told a conflicting story . \nSome reports quoted Osman as saying : ' I hardly know anything . \nThey only gave me a rucksack to carry on the tube in London . \nWe wanted to stage an attack , but only as a show . \nWho gave me the explosive ? \nI do n't know . \nI did n't know him . \nI do n't remember . \nWe did n't want to kill , we just wanted to scare people . ' \nMilan 's Corriere della Sera newspaper said Osman first told authorities he did not know what was in the backpack he took on the London underground , then changed his version , saying he was told the attackers were only supposed to carry out ` demonstrative ' attacks . \nBut the Rome daily Il Messaggero said the suspect told investigators : ` We were supposed to blow ourselves up . ' \nOsman allegedly said : ` More than praying we discussed work , politics , the war in Iraq ... we always had new films of the war in Iraq ... more than anything else those in which you could see Iraqi women and children who had been killed by US and UK soldiers . ' \nIf these reports turn out to be true , they will provide valuable insights into the workings of the alleged terrorist cells . \nThe revelations come as police in the UK begin hunting an al-Qaeda mastermind believed to be behind the recruitment and training of both sets of London bombers . \nThe prospect of a UK mastermind controlling the cells raises fears that other units may be active in Britain . \nDespite the arrest of all five men wanted in connection with the failed attacks , the Metropolitan Police Commissioner , Sir Ian Blair , warned last night of the risk of further bomb attacks . \nAccording to the reports , Hussain claimed the men did not talk about al-Qaeda or Osama bin Laden . \n` We had no contacts with the organization of bin Laden . \nWe knew it existed - we accessed its programs through the internet - but nothing directly , ' he is reported to have claimed , adding that the bombings of 7 July took them by surprise : ` We never had any contact with the Pakistanis . ' \nHowever , the bombs that devastated London that day were a signal that they could go into action . \n` Our boss taught us how to make explosives out of fertilisers , ' he is reported to have said , claiming the men put them into rucksacks and used timers . \nSecurity sources fear that at least one senior figure in the global terror organization is based in the UK . \nHe may have taken part in a whitewater rafting trip used as a bonding session for several of the suicide bombers in north Wales in early June . \nSweeping new security measures are to be introduced on Britain 's road and rail networks this week , including highway patrol officers on the M25 who will check bridges for bombs . \nSenior officers are particularly concerned there could be a third attack on Thursday , two weeks after the last attempt . \nOne officer said : ` When you look at the history of terrorist attacks and of al-Qaeda in particular , there is a pattern of repeated attacks on the same targets . \nThey hit the World Trade Centre twice . \nThey attacked the embassies in Egypt twice . \nIf anything the level of security around public transport on Thursday will be even higher than last . ' \nRather than the two cells being linked directly , investigators are now focusing on the idea that the men responsible for the 7 July bombs and those behind the failed attacks on 21 July may have been recruited and directed by the same person . \n` If you look at the structure of al-Qaeda , what you basically have is a pyramid , ' a security source told The Observer . \n` If you see the two groups of bombers as two separate teams of footsoldiers on the very bottom , then there is a possibility they are linked by the command structure in the level above . \nThis is the level we are trying to identify and track down . ' \nThe hunt has been given fresh impetus by this new intelligence which suggests that , rather than being manufactured between them , the explosives given to the bombers were handed over by people so far unidentified . \nItalian officials are preparing extradition proceedings against Osman . \nThey say he was born in Ethiopia , not Somalia , and may have used fake documents to obtain British citizenship . \nThe Interior Minister , Giuseppe Pisanu , told his parliament yesterday that Osman had tried to evade capture with the help of contacts among Italy 's Ethiopian and Eritrean immigrant communities , after fleeing London on the Eurostar train . \nThe suspect appeared before magistrates yesterday . \nHis lawyer , Antonietta Sonnessa , objected to his extradition and said it could take up to two months for him to be returned to London . \nIt has also emerged that Britain 's Somali community ` shopped ' the first alleged bomber , Hassan Omar , who was found in Birmingham last Wednesday . \n"}

'' \nSeifert 's widow said she was satisfied with the military justice system and called Akbar `` a nonentity to me '' . \nDefense lawyer Major David Coombs told jurors that a sentence of life without parole would allow Akbar to be treated for mental illness and possibly rehabilitated . \n`` Death is an absolute punishment , a punishment of last resort , '' he said . \nA defense psychiatrist testified that although Akbar was legally sane and understood the consequences of his attack , he suffered from forms of paranoia and schizophrenia . \nAkbar 's father , John Akbar , has said his son complained in vain to his superiors about religious and racial harassment before the attack . \nThe defense never introduced any witnesses to testify about any such harassment . \nJohn Akbar was not in the courtroom for the verdict . \nHe emerged from a meeting with his son in tears and declined to comment . \n"}
{"id": "248", "time": "2005-03-06", "text": "We should not ask whether the Iraq invasion was ` legal ' - we should ask whether it was ` good ' Sunday 6 March 2005 01.36 GMT Last week 's jilbab decision left me wondering whether the law was always this important . \nWas n't there a time when schools could take decisions about the uniforms their pupils should wear without a judge having the final say ? \nI see the advantages of greater legal protection for the individual and I also see the problems . \nAnd one of the dangers is that we may become reliant on legal processes to settle for us the question of what is right and what is wrong when , in reality , morality can neither begin nor end with the law . \nJust as we talk more than we used to about law at home , so we also increasingly discuss international law . \nThus it was with some fanfare that , also last week , Penguin published an important book by Professor Philippe Sands , a brilliant international lawyer . \nIn Lawless World , Sands 's central proposition is that the war on terror and the war on Iraq , as prosecuted by America and supported by Britain , pose a unique threat to a valuable system of international justice . \nThere is much that I can agree with in the book . \nIn particular , I accept that the arbitrary procedures for dealing with ` terror ' suspects at Guantanamo and Bagram have been a disaster , enhancing the likelihood of abuse , violating basic principles , discrediting those who laid most claim to be upholding human rights and strengthening opposition . \nAnd yet I have some problems with other aspects of his approach . \nOne is that , at important moments in his arguments about the law , I find that I have ceased to care as much as he wants me to about whether this or that action is , strictly speaking , legal . \nInstead , I find myself more concerned about whether the action is right . \nI 'm not alone ; many of those who routinely use the word ` illegal ' about the war do n't do so because of a detailed appreciation of Sands 's judgment on UN Resolution 1,441 versus that of , say , Professor Greenwood of the LSE , but merely as meaning ` very bad ' . \nAnd a second is that I find myself wondering at the selectivity , the implied politicisation , if you like , of what are claimed to be dispassionate legal observations . \nIt is interesting , for example , that though the book 's index lists 15 references to Abu Ghraib prison and the abuses carried out there , only one mentions it was a prison under Saddam , and none details the years when executions and torture made Abu Ghraib infamous throughout the Arab world . \nLet me further illustrate this problem of partiality . \nBefore the war , a group of international lawyers , including Sands , wrote to newspapers , pointing out that an invasion of Iraq without a specific resolution of the UN Security Council would undermine the rule of law . \nThe final paragraph added : ` Of course , even with that authorisation , serious questions would remain . \nA lawful war is not necessarily a just , prudent or humanitarian war . ' \nThis caveat would , presumably , have left some of the authors free to campaign against military action , even if it had been mandated by the Security Council . \nBut it inevitably implied that an illegal war , or a non-legal war , might quite possibly be a just , prudent or humanitarian one . \nSands goes some way to suggest that a humanitarian justification of the war might have been available in the 1980s -LRB- or , one supposes , in 1991\\/2 -RRB- when Saddam was at his most murderous . \nThis is a position shared , I think , by Human Rights Watch . \nAnd , in giving evidence last year to the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee , Sands even seemed to recognize that under such circumstances , no authorisation by the Security Council , explicit or implicit , might be necessary . \n` My personal view , ' he told the MPs , ` is very much moving towards the view that the circumstances of Kosovo -LRB- where no UN authorisation was sought or obtained -RRB- do not pose a problem in existing rules of international law . ' \nOf course , this was a slightly unhelpful five years after the event . \nJust how the sands can shift was further illustrated by his response to the committee chairman 's worry that he was in danger of sanctifying the decisions of a body - the Security Council - which is notoriously susceptible to political and even capricious vetoes . \n` Would not , ' he was asked , ` the international law be an ass if it could not respond in those circumstances ? ' \nSands replied that humanitarian intervention was a ` gray area , but many people are now beginning to accept that is justifiable . \nIn those circumstances , it does not matter what the Security Council does . \nIf there is an overriding threat to fundamental human rights on a massive scale then , irrespective of what the Security Council does , one state or a group of states may claim to be free to act . ' \nBut in the book , Sands describes Tony Blair 's suggestion that Britain was entitled to override an ` unreasonable ' veto as ` outrageous ' . \nWe have set up the rules of the Security Council and we must abide by them , he writes elsewhere . \nExcept , apparently , when we must n't . \nThis is the problem . \nIn 1972 , a neo-genocide by Pakistan in what is now Bangladesh was stopped by the unilateral intervention of India . \nPol Pot was ousted by the Vietnamese in 1979 , though the UN continued to recognize the Khmer Rouge leadership . \nIdi Amin 's rule in Uganda was brought to an end by Tanzanian intervention . \nNone of these appalling situations was resolved by the UN or the international legal system . \nNor were what Sands admits were the ` gross failures to intervene to prevent genocide and other atrocities ' in Yugoslavia and Rwanda in the 1990s the product of disregarding international law . \nSands is against what he sees as American and British illegality because ` relying on bad legal arguments destroys the credibility of governments ' , but he does n't recognize that negligence in the face of mass murder , tyranny , the sponsorship of terror or massive abuses of human rights is a much worse destroyer of credibility . \nHe observes that such events as Rwanda and the Balkans ` and most bitterly in the spring of 2003 , Iraq , raised serious questions about the adequacy of international rules to protect fundamental human rights ' . \nBut why does the overthrow of a vile regime raise questions ` more bitterly ' than the world 's toleration of the murder of more than 800,000 people ? \nNor can these negligences be somehow rectified by international courts after the event . \nAs Peter Maguire has written : ` The UN has spent hundreds of millions of dollars to try nine men in Tanzania , and close to 100,000 remain in prison in Rwanda . \nHas their punishment resurrected the 800,000 hacked to death in 1994 or ended a civil war that now engulfs Congo ? ' \nIt is n't just about massacres , either . \nSands believes that ` the UN 's system of collective security had contained Saddam better than most would have expected ' . \nThe unstated price , of course , included sanctions that many reckoned killed far more Iraqis than any war might have done , and the reality that Saddam was allowed to remain in power . \nBut he recognizes outcomes can alter the balance of even a legal argument . \nHe wrote recently in the Guardian : ` There is little evidence that the world is a safer place , and a great deal more evidence that the Iraq war has provided a major distraction to the challenge posed by global terrorism and al-Qaeda . \nNeither can it be said that the Middle East is more stable or peaceful . ' \nIn the book , he describes the invasion as ' a dangerous fiasco ' . \nMeanwhile , the silly , nasty , hubristic old neocons were in disgrace having predicted the spread of democracy . \nThis analysis looked a safer bet six months ago than it does now . \nLibya had already got rid of WMD capacity that it admitted possessing , but since then there have been the elections in Iraq , demonstrations against Syrian occupation in Lebanon , elections in Palestine , and suggestions of liberalisation in Saudi Arabia and Egypt . \nEven sceptics are wondering whether something is n't afoot , something caused , in part , by the removal of Saddam . \nIn these circumstances , it is an act of epic solipsism to argue this outcome is negated by the affront the action posed to the international legal system , a system that seemed to permit ill-doing and penalize its prevention . \nAnd if the law prevents good actions and objectively protects bad ones , it needs to be changed . \nAny non-lawyer could tell you that . \n"}

' \nPier Scolari , Sgrena 's partner who flew to Baghdad to collect her , put an even more sinister construction on the events , suggesting in a television interview that Sgrena was the victim of a deliberate ambush . \n` Giuliana may have received information which led to the soldiers not wanting her to leave Iraq alive , ' he claimed . \nSgrena was kidnapped on 4 February as she interviewed refugees from Falluja near a Baghdad mosque . \nTwo weeks later her captors issued a video of her weeping and pleading for help , calling on all foreigners to leave Iraq . \nItalian journalists were subsequently withdrawn from the city after intelligence warnings of a heightened threat to their safety . \nItalian newspapers reported yesterday that Sgrena had been in the hands of former Saddam loyalists and criminals , and that a ransom of between # 4 million and # 5 million had been paid for her release . \nThe military intelligence officer who lost his life , Nicola Calipari , 51 , was hailed as a national hero . \n"}

'' \nDozens of women gathered in central Baghdad yesterday to protest against what the organiser , Yanar Mohammad , feared would be a `` fascist , nationalist and Islamist '' constitution . \n`` We are fighting to avoid becoming second class citizens , '' she said . \nThe US embassy declined to discuss the negotiations but a state department official in Washington told the New York Times that the draft document should be judged in its entirety . \nThere are conflicting signals about the prospect of a deal before the deadline , with some factions claiming divisions have narrowed , others saying they have widened . \nIf a text is not handed to parliament by midnight , deputies could be asked to repeat last week 's vote and amend the existing law , which decreed the deadline , to extend it further . \nThe alternative would be to dissolve parliament and call an election , something the ruling Shia and Kurdish coalition wants to avoid . \nIf a text is agreed , there will be a referendum in October which - if passed - will pave the way for a December election . \nSunni Arabs , a dominant minority under Saddam Hussein and now the backbone of the insurgency , fear a constitution which cedes autonomy to Kurds in the north and Shias in the south , leaving central government too weak to funnel oil revenues to Sunnis in the middle . \nThe drafting committee 's 15-member Sunni bloc said it had been sidelined in recent days and appealed to the US and UN to ensure their voice was heard . \nUS and British diplomats have suggested that federalism will be fudged enough to bring mainstream Sunnis on board and drain support from the resistance . \nAl Qaida in Iraq and other insurgent groups have threatened to kill Sunnis who register to vote , saying the political process is a US-orchestrated sham . \nThree Sunnis who erected posters in Mosul urging people to vote were murdered last week . \n"}

'' \nNow insurgents earn praise from residents for allegedly pressuring managers to supply electricity almost 24 hours a day , a luxury denied the rest of Iraq . \nThe court caters solely for divorces and marriages . \nAlleged criminals are punished in the market . \nThe Guardian witnessed a headmaster accused of adultery whipped 190 times with cables . \nChildren laughed as he sobbed and his robe turned crimson . \nTwo men who robbed a foreign exchange shop were splayed on the ground . \nMasked men stood on their hands while others broke their arms with rocks . \nThe shopkeeper offered the insurgents a reward but they declined . \nDVDs of beheadings on the bridge are distributed free in the souk . \nChildren prefer them to cartoons . \n`` They should not watch such things , '' said one grandfather , but parents appeared not to object . \nOne DVD features a young , blond muscular man who had been disembowelled . \nHe was said to have been a member of a six-strong US sniper team ambushed and killed on August 1 . \nResidents said he had been paraded in town before being executed . \nThe US military denied that , saying six bodies were recovered and that all appeared to have died in combat . \nShortly after the ambush three landmines killed 14 marines in a convoy which ventured from their base outside the town . \nTwice in recent months marines backed by aircraft and armor swept into Haditha to flush out the rebels . \nIn a pattern repeated across Anbar there were skirmishes , a few suspects killed or detained , and success was declared . \nIn reality , said residents , the insurgents withdrew for a few days and returned when the Americans left . \nThey have learned from last November 's battle in Falluja , when hundreds died fighting the marines and still lost the city . \nNow their strategy appears to be to wait out the Americans , calculating they will leave within a few years , and then escalate what some consider the real war against a government led by Shias , a rival sect which Sunni extremists consider apostasy . \nThe US military declined to respond to questions detailing the extent of insurgent control in the town . \nThere was evidence of growing cooperation between rebels . \nA group in Falluja , where the resistance is said to be regrouping , wrote to Haditha requesting background checks on two volunteers from the town . \nOne local man in his 40s told the Guardian he wanted to be a suicide bomber to atone for sins and secure a place in heaven . \n`` But the mujahideen will not let me . \nThey said I had eight children and it was my duty to look after them . '' \nTribal elders said they feared but respected insurgents for keeping order and not turning the town into a battleground . \nThey appear to have been radicalised , and condemned Sunni groups , such as the Iraqi Islamic party and the Muslim Scholars ' Association , for engaging in the political process . \nThe constitution talks , the referendum due in October , the election due in December : all are deemed collaboration punishable by death . \nThe task now is to bleed the Americans and destabilise the government . \nSome call that nihilism . \nHaditha calls it the future . \nOmer Mahdi was in Haditha for a Guardian Films project before security precautions forced it to be suspended . \n"}

'' \nThe reality was somewhat different . \nParks was no victim . \nThe zeitgeist did not track her down ; she embodied it . \nShe had a long history of anti-racist activism and had often been thrown off buses for resisting segregation . \nFar from being a meek lady in need of a foot massage she was a keen supporter of Malcolm X , who never fully embraced King 's strategy of non-violence . \n`` To call Rosa Parks a poor , tired seamstress and not talk about her role as a community leader and civil rights activist as well , is to turn an organised struggle for freedom into a personal act of frustration , '' writes Herbert Kohl in his book She Would Not Be Moved . \nThe story of collective struggles is all too often filtered through the experience of an individual . \nIn a bid to render the account more palatable and popular , the personal takes precedence over the political . \nAs a result the story may reach a wider audience ; but by the time they receive it , the agendas and the issues involved have often become distorted - to the detriment of both the individual and the movement . \nThe story of Cindy Sheehan , the 48-year-old woman whose son Casey was killed in Iraq in April 2004 , is one such example . \nUntil late last week , Sheehan was camping outside President George Bush 's ranch in Crawford , Texas , demanding to see the president . \n`` I want to ask him , why did my son die ? '' \nshe told the Guardian . \n`` What was this noble cause you talk about ? \nAnd if the cause is so noble , when are you going to send your daughters over there and let somebody else 's son come home ? '' \nSheehan , who has met the president once before and was not impressed , had planned to stay at what became known as Camp Casey for the whole of August but had to leave on Thursday because her mother became sick . \nWith the help of PR consultants she was packaged as a grieving Everymother who wanted answers . \nCapturing the public imagination , over the past two weeks she has been a regular feature on US cable and network news , the letters pages and newspaper editorials . \nIn turn , she has re-energised the anti-war movement . \nOn Wednesday , thousands of people across the country attended 1,627 vigils in solidarity with her cause . \nHer popularity has made her a prime target for the right . \nOne commentator on Rupert Murdoch 's Fox channel branded her a `` crackpot '' ; Christopher Hitchens derided her for `` spouting piffle '' and lambasted her protest as `` dreary , sentimental nonsense '' . \nTalk-radio king Rush Limbaugh said her story `` is nothing more than forged documents - there 's nothing about it that 's real '' . \nThe backlash continued this weekend with the launch of a `` You Do n't Speak for Me Cindy '' tour heading for Crawford with the support of rightwing talk radio hosts , to set up a pro-war camp . \nThe focus on Sheehan 's personal loss is indeed problematic . \nBereavement , in and of itself , confers neither knowledge nor insight - only a particular sensibility that might lead to both and a compelling personal narrative through which to articulate them . \nTo define her as a mournful mother , while ignoring that she is a politically conscious , media-savvy campaigner , which she has been for quite some time , does neither her nor her cause any favors . \nIndeed , those who focus on Sheehan 's woes , whether they support or attack her , miss the point entirely . \nHad she come to Crawford at Easter , she would most likely have gone unnoticed . \nThe reason she has struck a chord is not because of the sorrow that is personal to her but because of the frustration she shares with the rest of the country over Iraq . \nThat is also why the right have attacked her so ferociously and so personally . \nBut unlike the Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry in his swift boat , Sheehan will not be blown off course quite so easily . \nThe public mood in America is shifting consistently and decisively against the war and Bush 's handling of it . \nGallup has commissioned eight polls asking whether it was worth going to war since the beginning of the year : every time at least half have said no. . \nFor the first time , most people believe the invasion of Iraq has made the US more vulnerable to further attacks . \nThe number of those who want all the troops withdrawn remains a minority at 33 % - but that is double what it was two years ago , and still growing . \nThe reason Sheehan has become such a lightning rod is because that mood has found only inadequate and inconsistent expression in Congress . \nIt has been left to her to articulate an escalating political demand that is in desperate need of political representation . \nThis marks not only a profound dislocation between the political class and political culture but a short circuit in the democratic process . \nThe mainstream has effectively been marginalised . \nThis is not particular to the US . \nIn Britain , the view that there was a link between Iraq and the London bombings was shared by two-thirds of the population , but the handful of politicians who dared to mention it were shouted down in parliament and vilified in the press . \nIn Germany , all the main parties support the labor market reforms that will cut welfare entitlements and reduce social protection , even though most of the population do not . \nBut what many `` centre-left '' politicians regard as electoral expediency is actually becoming an electoral liability . \nEvidence exists that support for more radical stances is there if only they had the backbone to campaign for it . \nIn Germany , a new leftwing party combining ex-communists and disaffected Social Democrats is attracting 12 % in polls and could yet rob the right of an outright victory next month . \nThis month , in a congressional byelection in southern Ohio , Paul Hackett , a marine reservist who recently served in Iraq , stood for the Democrats on an anti-war platform . \nIn a constituency where the Republicans won with 72 % of the vote nine months ago , Hackett branded Bush a `` chicken hawk '' . \nHe won 48 % , turning a safe seat into a marginal . \nSadly , such examples are all too rare . \nSheehan has revealed both the strength and the weakness of the left . \nWe have a political agenda that can command considerable mainstream support ; yet we do not have a political leadership willing or able to articulate those agendas . \nWe wield political influence ; we lack legislative power . \n"}

'' \nThe United States is now that weary Titan . \nIn the British case , the angst was a result of the unexpectedly protracted , bloody and costly Boer war , in which a small group of foreign insurgents defied the mightiest military the world had seen ; concern about the rising economic power of Germany and the United States ; and a combination of imperial overstretch with socio-economic problems at home . \nIn the American case , it 's a result of the unexpectedly protracted , bloody and costly Iraq war , in which a small group of foreign insurgents defies the mightiest military the world has seen ; concern about the rising economic power of China and India ; and a combination of imperial overstretch with socio-economic problems at home . \nIraq is America 's Boer war . \nRemember that after the British had declared the end of major combat operations in the summer of 1900 , the Boers launched a campaign of guerrilla warfare that kept British troops on the run for another two years . \nThe British won only by a ruthlessness of which , I 'm glad to say , the democratic , squeamish and still basically anti-colonialist United States appears incapable . \nIn the end , the British had 450,000 British and colonial troops there -LRB- compared with some 150,000 US troops in Iraq -RRB- , and herded roughly a quarter of the Boer population into concentration camps , where many died . \nIn a recent CNN\\/Gallup poll , 54 % of those asked said it was a mistake to send American troops into Iraq , and 57 % said the Iraq war has made the US less safe from terrorism . \nThe protest camp outside President Bush 's ranch in Crawford , which grew around the mother of a soldier who died in Iraq , exemplifies the pain . \nCNN last Sunday aired a documentary with top-level sources explaining in detail how the intelligence on Saddam 's weapons of mass destruction was distorted , abused , sexed up and , as the program was entitled , Dead Wrong . \nThis will hardly be news for British or European readers , but the facts have not been so widely aired in the US . \nIn another poll , the number of those who rated the president as `` honest '' fell below 50 % for the first time . \nThis week , he has again attempted to bolster support for his administration and his war . \nIt does n't seem to be working . \nA recent article in the New York Times plausibly estimated the prospective long-term cost of the Iraq War at more than $ 1 trillion . \nIf Iraqi politicians do finally agree a draft constitution for their country today , only the world 's greatest optimist can believe that it will turn Iraq into a peaceful , stable , democratic federal republic . \nIncreasingly , the Islamic Republic of Iran quietly calls the shots in the Shia south of Iraq . \nAs the Washington joke goes : the war is over , and the Iranians won . \nMeanwhile , oil prices of more than $ 60 a barrel put the price of petrol at American pumps up to nearly $ 3 a gallon for basic unleaded fuel . \nFor someone from Europe this is still unbelievably cheap , but you should hear the shrieks of agony here . \n`` Gas prices have changed my life , '' moaned a distressed Californian commuter . \nIf higher energy prices persist , they threaten not just a still vibrant economy but a whole way of life , symbolised by the Hummer -LRB- in both its civilian and military versions -RRB- . \nBesides instability in the Middle East , the main force pushing up oil prices is the relentless growth of demand for energy from the emerging economic giants of Asia . \nThe Chinese go around the world quietly signing big oil supply deals with any oil-producing country they can find , however nasty its politics , including Sudan and Iran . \nWhen a Chinese concern tried to buy a big California energy company , that was too much - American politicians screamed and effectively blocked the deal . \nChina and India are to the United States today what Germany and America were to Britain a hundred years ago . \nChina is now the world 's second largest energy consumer , after the United States . \nIt also has the world 's second largest foreign currency reserves , after Japan and followed by Taiwan , South Korea and India . \nIn the foreign reserve stakes , the US comes only ninth , after Singapore and just before Malaysia . \nAccording to some economists , the US has an effective net savings rate - taking account of all public spending and debt - of zero . \nThis country does not save ; it spends . \nThe television channels are still full of a maddening barrage of endless commercials , enticing you to spend , spend , spend - and then to `` consolidate '' your accumulated debt in one easy package . \nNone of this is to suggest that the United States will decline and fall tomorrow . \nAfter all , the British empire lasted for another 40 years after 1905 . \nIn fact , it grew to its largest extent after 1918 , before it signed its own death warrant by expending its blood and treasure to defeat Adolf Hitler -LRB- not the worst way to go -RRB- . \nSimilarly , one may anticipate that America 's informal empire - its network of military bases and semi-protectorates - will continue to grow . \nThe United States , like Edwardian Britain , still has formidable resources of economic , technological and military power , cultural attractiveness and , not least , the will to stay on top . \nAs one British music hall ditty at that time proclaimed : And we mean to be top dog still . \nYes , we mean to be top dog still . \nYou do n't have to go very far to hear that refrain in Washington today . \nThe Bush administration 's national security strategy makes no bones about the goal of maintaining military supremacy . \nBut whether the `` American century '' that began in 1945 will last until 2045 , 2035 or only 2025 , its end can already be glimpsed on the horizon . \nIf you are , by any chance , of that persuasion that would instinctively find this a cause for rejoicing , pause for a moment to consider two things : first , that major shifts of power between rising and falling great powers have usually been accompanied by major wars ; and second , that the next top dog could be a lot worse . \nSo this is no time for schadenfreude . \nIt 's a time for critical solidarity . \nA few far-sighted people in Washington are beginning to formulate a long-term American strategy of trying to create an international order that would protect the interests of liberal democracies even when American hyperpower has faded ; and to encourage rising powers such as India and China to sign up to such an order . \nThat is exactly what today 's weary Titan should be doing , and we should help him do it . \n"}
{"id": "105", "time": "2005-08-25", "text": "He 's a friend of Fidel Castro , a fierce critic of the war in Iraq , and wants to spread revolutionary fervor throughout South America . \nVenezuela 's president , Hugo Ch vez , has long been a thorn in the side of the US - a fact highlighted this week when televangelist Pat Robertson called for his assassination . \nRichard Gott on a man at war with the White House Hugo Chvez , the president of Venezuela , is a genial fellow with a good sense of humor and a steely political purpose . \nAs a former military officer , he is accustomed to the language of battle and he thrives under attack . \nHe will laugh off this week 's suggestion by Pat Robertson , the US televangelist , that he should be assassinated , but he will also seize on it to ratchet up the verbal conflict with the United States that has lasted throughout his presidency . \nChvez , now 51 , is the same age as Tony Blair , and after nearly seven years as president he has been in power for almost as long . \nBut there the similarities end . \nChvez is a man of the left and , like most Latin Americans with a sense of history , he is distrustful of the United States . \nFree elections in Latin America have often thrown up radical governments that Washington would like to see overthrown , and the Chvez government is no exception to this rule . \nChvez is a genuinely revolutionary figure , one of those larger-than-life characters who surface regularly in the history of Latin America - and achieve power perhaps twice in a hundred years . \nHe wants to change the history of the continent . \nHis close friend and role model is Fidel Castro , Cuba 's long-serving leader . \nThe two men meet regularly , talk constantly on the telephone , and have formed a close political and military alliance . \nVenezuela has deployed more than 20,000 Cuban doctors in its shanty-towns , and Cuba is the grateful recipient of cheap Venezuelan oil , replacing the subsidised oil it once used to receive from the Soviet Union . \nThis , in the eyes of the US government , would itself be a heinous crime that would put Chvez at the top of its list for removal . \nThe US has been at war with Cuba for nearly half a century , mostly conducted by economic means , and it only abandoned plans for Castro 's direct overthrow after subscribing to a tacit agreement not to do so with the Soviet Union after the missile crisis of 1962 . \nThe Americans would have dealt with Chvez long ago had they not been faced by two crucial obstacles . \nFirst , they have been notably preoccupied in recent years in other parts of the world , and have hardly had the time , the personnel , or the attention span to deal with the charismatic colonel . \nSecond , Venezuela is one of the principal suppliers of oil to the US market -LRB- literally so in that 13,000 US petrol stations are owned by Citgo , an extension of Venezuela 's state oil company -RRB- . \nAny hasty attempt to overthrow the Venezuelan government would undoubtedly threaten this oil lifeline , and Chvez himself has long warned that his assassination would close down the pumps . \nWith his popularity topping 70 % in the polls , he would be a difficult figure to dislodge . \nChvez comes from the provinces of Venezuela , from the vast southern cattle lands of the Llanos that stretch down to the Apure and Orinoco river system . \nOf black and Indian ancestry , his parents were local schoolteachers , and he has inherited their didactic skills . \nHis talents first came to the fore when he joined the army and became a popular lecturer at the war college in Caracas . \nHe is a brilliant communicator , speaking for hours on television in a folksy manner that captivates his admirers and irritates his opponents . \nHe never stops talking and he never stops working . \nHe has time for everyone and never forgets a face . \nFor several years he traveled incessantly around the country , to keep an eye on what was going on . \nThis was not mere electioneering , for he would talk for hours to those who had hardly a vote among them . \nHe exhausts his cadres , his secretaries and his ministers . \nI have traveled with him and them into the deepest corners of the country , and then , after a 16-hour day , he would call the grey-faced cabinet together for an impromptu meeting to analyze what they had discovered and what measures they should take . \nThere was always a touch of the 19th century about this frenetic activity , as though the president were still on horseback , and Castro is known to have warned Chvez not to absorb himself unduly in the minutiae of administration . \n`` You are the president of Venezuela , '' he is reported to have said , `` not the mayor of Caracas . '' \nChvez has taken the advice to heart , and has become less the populist folk hero and more the impressive statesman . \nConcern about possible assassination has long predated Robertson 's outburst , and for the past two years Chvez has cut down his travels inside the country and been accompanied everywhere by fearsome-looking guards . \nAbroad , however , he is a frequent visitor to the capitals of Latin America , and he is widely perceived as the leader of the group of left-leaning presidents recently elected in Brazil , Argentina , and Uruguay , as well as the inspiration of the radicalised indigenous movements now clamouring at the gates of power in Bolivia and Ecuador . \nThere is another touch of the 19th century here , for Chvez is a follower and promoter of the ideas and career of Simn Bolvar , the Venezuelan leader who brought the philosophy of the European Enlightenment and the French Revolution to Latin America , and liberated much of the continent from Spanish rule . \nChvez has labeled his movement the `` Bolivarian Revolution '' , and he hopes that his political ideas will spread throughout the continent . \nThis in itself would be alarming enough to the United States , had it the time to pay proper attention . \nEqually worrying for the Americans is the time Chvez has devoted to the Middle East , successfully courting the governments that belong to Opec , the oil producers ' organization , some of whom have been labeled by the Americans as `` the axis of evil '' . \nToday 's high oil price has much to do with increased demand from China and India , and from the Iraq war , but the spadework that has given Opec fresh credibility was put in by Chvez . \nSoon he will be helping to show the new Iranian president , using the Venezuelan example , how to increase the revenues of a state-owned oil company and channel them into programs to help the poor . \nChvez is widely popular today , but for much of his presidency he has been a contested , even a hated figure , arousing widespread discontent within Venezuela 's traditional white elite . \nYet although his rhetoric is revolutionary , his reforms have been moderate and social democratic . \nHe criticises the policies of `` savage neo-liberalism '' that have done so much harm to the poorer peoples of Venezuela and Latin America in the past 20 years , yet the private sector is still alive and well . \nHis land reform is aimed chiefly at unproductive land and provides for compensation . \nHis most obvious achievement , which should not have been controversial , has been to channel increased oil revenues into a fresh range of social projects that bring health and education into neglected shanty-towns . \nThe hatred that he arouses in the old opposition parties , which have seen their membership and influence dwindle , lies more in ideology and racial antipathy than in material loss . \nSome opponents dislike his friendship with Castro , his verbal hostility to the United States , and his criticisms of the Catholic church , and some people still have a residual hostility to the fact that he staged an unsuccessful military coup in 1992 when a young colonel in the parachute regiment . \nMany Latin Americans still find it difficult to come to terms with the idea of a progressive military man . \nBut mostly they are alarmed by the way in which he has enfranchised the country 's vast underclass , interrupting the cosy , US-influenced lifestyle of the white middle class with visions of a frightening world that lives beyond their apartheid-gated communities . \nOver the past few years this anxious opposition has made several attempts to get rid of Chvez , with the tacit encouragement of Washington . \nThey organised a coup in April 2002 that rebounded against them two days later when the kidnapped Chvez was returned to power by an alliance of the army and the people . \nThey tried an economic coup by closing down the oil refineries , and this too was a failure . \nLast year 's recall-referendum , designed to lead to a defeat for Chvez , was an overwhelming victory for him . \nThe local opposition , and by extension the United States , have shot their final bolt . \nThere is nothing left in the locker , except of course assassination . \nThe fingers of mad preachers are usually far from the button , but the untimely words of Pat Robertson , easily discounted in Washington and airily dismissed by the state department as `` inappropriate '' , might yet wake an echo among zealots in Venezuela . \nA similar call was made last year by a former Venezuelan president . \nAssassinations may be easy to plan , and not difficult to accomplish . \nBut their legacy is incalculable . \nThe radical leader of neighbouring Colombia , Jorge Gaitn , was assassinated more than 50 years ago , in 1948 . \nIn terms of civil war and violence , the Colombians have been paying the price ever since . \nNo one would wish that fate on Venezuela . \nRichard Gott is the author of Hugo Chvez and the Bolivarian Revolution , published this month by Verso , price # 9.99 . \n"}

\nI continued my pre-dawn runs . \nThe 800th Military Police Brigade , which I commanded , was one of a patchwork of reserve units that had come to Iraq to hold prisoners of war . \nBut we were now being sent to Baghdad to help restore the Iraqi civilian prison system - a mission the brigade never had prepared for . \nWorking in decimated facilities with inadequate supplies and incarcerating robbers , murderers and suspected terrorists was not in our playbook . \nBut it was our job . \nWe would operate under the auspices of the task force commanded by General Ricardo Sanchez . \nSome commanders , no matter their appearance , radiate dynamism and leadership . \nSanchez , a dour-looking individual , did not . \nWhen I went to meet him , the message I got was : over my dead body this female is going to be in charge of all the police operations in this country . \nIt turned out that there was one other female general on the ground : a one-star who ran the intelligence staff for Sanchez . \nBut I was commanding troops in a combat zone - and that was tough for the combat generals to take . \nOur `` interim '' facility at Abu Ghraib was morphing into our maximum prison for all of Iraq . \nIn the summer of 2003 , we had 700-800 prisoners . \nBy September , nearly 3,000 . \nBy the autumn , 7,000 . \nIn short , Abu Ghraib was working well . \nWithin a month after taking our first prisoners there , the leader of the military intelligence -LRB- MI -RRB- brigade at the prison , Colonel Thomas Pappas , came to see me . \nHis MI specialists were interrogating security detainees 24\\/7 . \nHis teams harangued the prisoners , and he in turn was harangued by Sanchez to get better information . \nThe creeping MI takeover of Abu Ghraib culminated in November , when Sanchez issued an order for the 205th MI brigade , under Pappas , to take tactical control of Abu Ghraib . \nThe chain of command was murky . \nI was still in charge of the MP -LRB- military policemen -RRB- guards , but from then on Pappas controlled the life of what had become an intelligence and interrogation center . \nIt is still hard to believe that , within a month , the seasoned soldiers of the 372nd MP company , with a previous deployment to Bosnia under their belts , would perpetrate prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib that would shock the world and severely damage America 's standing in the Middle East . \nI can only speculate about what might have happened . \nThe MPs of the 372nd found themselves supervising security detainees . \nWhile these MPs had never handled such prisoners before , the civilian MI interrogators came to the job with worlds of experience and a mandate to crack down . \nThe interrogators enlisted the MPs in their cause , a trick imported from Guantnamo . \nSoldiers who had been trained to treat prisoners humanely now heard praise for softening up the interrogation subjects . \nGood job keeping the lights on all night ; good job blasting music incessantly . \nGood job because they 're really talking now . \nNo MPs would have known anything about the more sophisticated techniques employed by the intelligence specialists . \nThese were aimed at Middle-Eastern Muslim prisoners in particular : the shame of being seen naked , of having a woman see them without clothes , the humiliation of wearing women 's underwear , the fear of dogs . \nOnly experienced intelligence operatives could have told the MPs to use such techniques . \nUnfortunately , in Specialist Charles Graner , they found an enthusiastic disciple . \nGraner enlisted his girlfriend , Lynndie England , whom he knew would readily join in the sexual humiliation . \nHis supervisor , Staff Sergeant Ivan Frederick , joined in , and the company 's more senior NCOs and officers , who should have seen what was happening , did n't . \nI never had the slightest idea that anything out of the ordinary was happening . \nNeither soldiers nor prisoners reported any infractions , or raised any concerns . \nIn retrospect , I have asked myself whether I was tough enough with these subordinates and in my whole approach to leadership in Abu Ghraib . \nDid I spend too much effort trying to take care of my soldiers and devote too little attention to training and disciplining them ? \nWhen interrogators encouraged these young MPs to `` soften up '' suspected terrorists , they had no relevant training to fall back on . \nNeither Pappas nor I knew what had been happening in cellblock 1A . \nOne night in December , an MP named Specialist Joseph Darby was sent there to drop off a document . \nDarby saw a couple of naked detainees and made a hasty exit . \nThen , as he was looking through a disk of images Graner had given him for a record of the unit 's service in Iraq , Darby came upon some of the shocking photos . \nHe later slipped a disk under the door of the criminal investigation field office at Abu Ghraib . \nWhen an agent examined it , he was floored , and the scandal unfolded . \nWhat could I have done to stop the abuse before it started ? \nWhy did I not see something like this coming ? \nWhen I formally reported to General Sanchez , the commander said not a word . \nI said , `` Sir , when I saw the pictures I was absolutely sickened by them . \nI thought I was going to throw up . '' \nHe put his hand up to stop me . \n`` Do you have any idea what this will do to my army ? '' \n`` Sir , I ca n't even begin to understand what these soldiers were thinking . '' \nAgain he put up his hand . \n`` This is unacceptable , '' he said . \nHe had to be worrying about protecting himself . \nTwo months earlier , he had taken away authority over Abu Ghraib -LRB- but not the other prisons -RRB- from me , and handed it to his own intelligence officer , who acted through Colonel Pappas , the intelligence man on the scene . \nUnder pressure from Washington to increase the flow of `` actionable intelligence '' against a growing Iraqi insurgency , he had , in effect , cut me out and taken direct control . \nBut now things were going sour , he was staking down a sacrificial lamb . \nI did n't leave my meeting with Sanchez chastened . \nAll of my career , I had wanted nothing but to serve as a soldier , yet time and again I found myself singled out not as a rising officer , but as a woman . \nHere I was back in that role I could not shake : the woman in a warrior 's world . \nThere had to be a prominent scapegoat , and how could I have not seen who it would be ? \nFollowing Major General Taguba 's investigation , I was formally relieved of my command . \nBut President Bush delivered a blow I had not expected at all - vacating my promotion to general and demoting me to colonel . \nIt is immensely difficult to accept these verdicts of dishonor from my government and my army , when I know in my heart I do not deserve them . \nYet I remain immensely proud of my service . \nI was made for a life in the military , and I hope my experiences will ease the way for the women who will follow me in that career . \nExtracted from One Woman 's Army by Janis Karpinski , published by Miramax Books tomorrow . \n"}
{"id": "164", "time": "2005-10-18", "text": "Are we going to war with Iran ? \nDan Plesch evaluates the evidence pointing towards a new conflict in the Middle East Tuesday 18 October 2005 12.01 BST The Sunday Telegraph warned last weekend that the UN had a last chance to avert war with Iran and , at a meeting in London last week , the US ambassador to the UN , John Bolton , expressed his regret that any failure by the UN security council to deal with Iran would damage the security council 's relevance , implying that the US would solve the problem on its own . \nOnly days before , the foreign secretary , Jack Straw , had dismissed military action as `` inconceivable '' while both the American president and his secretary of state had insisted war talk was not on the agenda . \nThe UN 's International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors have found that Iran has not , so far , broken its commitments under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , although it has concealed activities before . \nIt appears that the UK and US have decided to raise the stakes in the confrontation with Iran . \nThe two countries persuaded the IAEA board - including India - to overrule its inspectors , declare Iran in breach of the non-proliferation treaty -LRB- NPT -RRB- and say that Iran 's activities could be examined by the UN security council . \nCritics of this political process point to the fact that India itself has developed nuclear weapons and refused to join the NPT , but has still voted that Iran is acting illegitimately . \nOn the Iranian side there is also much belligerent talk and pop music now proudly speaks of the nuclear contribution to Iranian security . \nThe timing of the recent allegations about Iranian intervention in Iraq also appears to be significant . \nEver since the US refused to control Iraq 's borders in April 2003 , Iranian backed militia have dominated the south and , with under 10,000 soldiers amongst a population of millions , the British army had little option but to go along . \nNo fuss was made until now . \nAs for the bombings of British soldiers , some sources familiar with the US army engineers report that these supposedly sophisticated devices have been manufactured inside Iraq for many months and do not need to be imported . \nBut is the war talk for real or is it just sabre rattling ? \nThe conventional wisdom is that for both military and political reasons it would be impossible for Israel and the UK\\/US to attack and that , in any event , after the politically damaging Iraq war , neither Tony Blair nor George Bush would be able to gather political support for another attack . \nBut in Washington , Tel Aviv and Downing Street , if not the Foreign Office , Iran is regarded as a critical threat . \nThe regime in Tehran continues to demand the destruction of the state of Israel and to support anti-Israeli forces . \nIn what appeared to be coordinated releases of intelligence assessments , Israeli and US intelligence briefed earlier this year that , while Iran was years from a nuclear weapons capability , the technological point of no return was now imminent . \nShortly after the US elections , the vice-president , Dick Cheney , warned that Israel might attack Iran . \nIsrael has the capability to attack Iranian targets with aircraft and long-range cruise missiles launched from submarines , while Iranian air defences are still mostly based on 25-year-old equipment purchased in the time of the Shah . \nA US attack might be portrayed as a more reasonable option than a renewed Israeli-Islamic confrontation . \nThe US army and marines are heavily committed in Iraq , but soldiers could be found if the Bush administration were intent on invasion . \nDonald Rumsfeld has been reorganising the army to increase front-line forces by a third . \nMore importantly , naval and air force firepower has barely been used in Iraq . \nJust 120 B52 and stealth bombers could target 5,000 points in Iran with satellite-guided bombs in just one mission . \nIt is for this reason that John Pike of globalsecurity.org thinks that a US attack could come with no warning at all . \nUS action is often portrayed as impossible , not only because of the alleged lack of firepower , but because Iranian facilities are too hard to target . \nIn a strategic logic not lost on Washington , the conclusion then is that if you can not guarantee to destroy all the alleged weapons , then it must be necessary to remove the regime that wants them , and regime change has been the official policy in Washington for many years . \nFor political-military planners , precision strikes on a few facilities have drawbacks beyond leaving the regime intact . \nThey allow the regime too many retaliatory options . \nCertainly , Iran 's neighbors in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf who are worried about the growth of Iranian Shia influence in Iraq would want any attack to be decisive . \nFrom this logic grows the idea of destroying the political-military infrastructure of the clerical regime and perhaps encouraging separatist Kurdish and Azeri risings in the north-west . \nSome Washington planners have hopes of the Sunnis of oil-rich Khuzestan breaking away too . \nA new war may not be as politically disastrous in Washington as many believe . \nScott Ritter , the whistleblowing former UN weapons inspector , points out that few in the Democratic party will stand in the way of the destruction of those who conducted the infamous Tehran embassy siege that ended Jimmy Carter 's presidency . \nMr Ritter is one of the US analysts , along with Seymour Hersh , who have led the allegations that Washington is going to war with Iran . \nFor an embattled President Bush , combating the mullahs of Tehran may be a useful means of diverting attention from Iraq and reestablishing control of the Republican party prior to next year 's congressional elections . \nFrom this perspective , even an escalating conflict would rally the nation behind a war president . \nAs for the succession to President Bush , Bob Woodward has named Mr Cheney as a likely candidate , a step that would be easier in a wartime atmosphere . \nMr Cheney would doubtless point out that US military spending , while huge compared to other nations , is at a far lower percentage of gross domestic product than during the Reagan years . \nWith regard to Mr Blair 's position , it would be helpful to know whether he has committed Britain to preventing an Iranian bomb `` come what may '' as he did with Iraq . \n"}
{"id": "266", "time": "2005-10-18", "text": "UK attacks presence at conference on hunger PM and Bush likened to Axis leaders over Iraq war Britain expressed outrage yesterday after Robert Mugabe took advantage of a United Nations ceremony in Rome to compare Tony Blair to Italy 's wartime dictator , Benito Mussolini . \nDeparting from his prepared text at the 60th anniversary celebrations of the UN 's biggest agency , the Food and Agriculture Organisation , the Zimbabwean leader described the prime minister and the US president , George Bush , as `` international terrorists '' . \nHe also denounced their invasion of Iraq , saying they were `` the two unholy men of our millennium who , in the same way as Hitler and Mussolini formed -LRB- an -RRB- unholy alliance , formed an alliance to attack an innocent country '' . \nMatthew Wyatt , Britain 's representative at the FAO , said Mr Mugabe 's presence at a conference on food and hunger was a `` sick irony '' . \nHe told the Guardian : `` It is extremely unfortunate that Mugabe was at this occasion . \nHe has created hunger and poverty in his own country . '' \nAid groups have estimated that five million of Zimbabwe 's 12 million people may need food aid this year . \nMr Mugabe 's policies , including the forcible redistribution of white-owned farms , have been widely criticised for plunging the country into its deepest economic crisis since independence . \nMr Mugabe said that his land reforms had been needed to redress `` gross imbalances '' left by colonialism . \nMr Wyatt said that he and other delegates had gone to the anniversary celebrations `` to remind ourselves that there are , by the FAO 's estimate , 852 million hungry people , and that we face a huge challenge meeting the millennium development goals . \nHaving somebody like Mugabe present was entirely inappropriate . \nIt would have been better for all of us - the FAO included - if he had not come . '' \nHis outrage was echoed by that of his US counterpart , Tony Hall , who described the Zimbabwean president as someone who `` chews up his own people and spits them out '' . \nThat was clearly not the view of some of the other delegates who repeatedly applauded Mr Mugabe 's fiery anti-western diatribe . \nFlanked by bodyguards , the Zimbabwean leader declared : `` The voice of Mr Bush and the voice of Mr Blair ca n't decide who shall rule in Zimbabwe , who shall rule in Africa , who shall rule in Asia , who shall rule in Venezuela , who shall rule in Iran , who shall rule in Iraq . '' \nHis reference to Venezuela was well received by Hugo Chvez , who told Italy 's Ansa news agency : `` I pay tribute to Mugabe . '' \nThe Venezuelan president added : `` The president of Zimbabwe is made out to be a villain - because he takes land from those who do n't need it to give it to those who need it to live . '' \nBritish and US officials acknowledged that customarily the FAO invites the heads of state of all its member nations to such events . \nBut yesterday 's rumpus is bound to fuel growing disquiet in London and Washington over the course being taken by the agency under the leadership of its Senegalese director general , Jacques Diouf , who has been in place since 1994 ; next month he will stand unopposed for a third term of office . \nPresident Mugabe yesterday thanked the director general for having invited him despite objections made by the US . \nAmerican officials said last month that they were preparing to place travel restrictions on Mr Mugabe , his government and family . \nThe ban is expected to be similar to one imposed by the EU following claims that the Zimbabwean government was involved in vote-rigging in the 2000 and 2002 elections . \nUnder an agreement with the FAO , Italy does not impose any restrictions on delegates visiting the agency . \nHowever , the head of the Italian parliament 's agriculture committee , Sergio Agoni , said it was `` scandalous that Robert Mugabe should be coming to speak about food at a time when his compatriots are dying in the streets for lack of foodstuffs and human rights '' . \nMr Mugabe also enjoys immunity for visits to the Vatican ; earlier this year , he exploited to the full his attendance at the funeral of Pope John Paul II . \nPlaced close to the Prince of Wales , he leaned over and shook the prince 's hand during the service . \nThe prince 's household said afterwards that he had been taken by surprise . \n"}

{"id": "187", "time": "2005-10-27", "text": "Abu Theeb is the leader of a band of Sunni insurgents that preys on US targets north of Baghdad . \nLast week he openly defied al-Qaida in Iraq by actively supporting the referendum . \nGhaith Abdul-Ahad spent five days with him - and uncovered evidence of a growing split in the insurgency Abu Theeb is a tall , handsome , well-built man with a thin beard and thick eyebrows . \nHis name is a nom de guerre : it means Father of the Wolf . \nHe is a farmer during daylight and a commander of a mujahideen cell , a group of holy warriors , at night . \nHe and his men roam the farmland north of Baghdad in search of prey - a US armored Humvee , perhaps , or an Iraqi army unit . \nOn the eve of last week 's constitutional referendum , Abu Theeb , the leader of a group of Sunni insurgents , was to be found in the middle of a schoolyard in a village north of Baghdad . \nThe school was to be a polling center the next day . \nHe stood flanked by 10 bearded fighters in white robes and chequered headscarves . \nThere were a few posters on the walls , and plastic ribbons marking out lanes where voters would queue , but other than Abu Theeb and his men , the building was deserted . \nThe security guards hired by the referendum committee in Baghdad had failed to show up - not all that surprising an event in one of the most dangerous areas in Iraq . \nThe local tribe , ie Abu Theeb and co , are notorious for kidnappings and executions . \nAbu Theeb looked around him , a commander inspecting the field before battle . \nHe moved with his men around the school , inspecting the adjacent streets and the back gate , looking for weak points , looking for easy access for a car bomb or an armed onslaught . \nThe school guard sheepishly followed the entourage around , a Kalashnikov on one shoulder . \nAt one point , Abu Theeb grabbed a piece of paper and drew a sketch of the school , marking out where his men should be posted the next day . \nHe turned to a short , chubby ginger-haired guy in his 30s with a big jihadi beard . \n`` You will be the commander tomorrow , '' he said . \n`` Distribute some of our weapons to the men . '' \nThe stakes were high for Abu Theeb and his men . \nAl-Qaida forces in Iraq - forces that are , at least on paper , allies of the Sunni insurgents - had vowed to kill anyone who took part in the referendum . \nBut in the Sunni areas of Iraq , the people and the local Iraqi insurgents among them had a different view : they were eager to vote . \nThere was a widespread sense of regret about the boycotting of the last elections , which left the parliament in Baghdad dominated by Shia and Kurdish parties - and left the Sunnis , who held the power in Saddam 's Iraq , out in the cold . \nThe Sunnis wanted to take part in last week 's referendum ; they wanted a `` no '' vote on the draft constitution . \nThis left Abu Theeb , a man who has devoted himself and his resources to fighting the Americans , in a curious position . \nHis battle on polling day would be to secure a safe and smooth voting for his people - in a referendum organised by the enemy . \nIn doing so he would be going up against the al-Qaida forces , and risking a split in the insurgency in Iraq . \nI spent five days with Abu Theeb and his people last week , and I witnessed a very curious thing : a bunch of mujahideens talking politics and urging restraint . \n`` Politics for us is like filthy dead meat , '' Abu Theeb told me . \n`` We are not allowed to eat it , but if you are passing through the desert and your life depends on it , God says it 's OK . '' \nThis is a profound shift in thinking for these insurgents , a shift that might just change the way things develop in Iraq . \nWhile we were at the school , Abu Theeb pulled one of his young men aside and rebuked him for an IED - improvised explosive device - bombing the night before : `` I thought we agreed that nothing will happen for the next few days . '' \nThe short young man mumbled that it was n't his group - someone else must have done it . \nAbu Theeb 's village , where the polling station was based , is a small hamlet that lies on the banks of the Tigris river north of Baghdad . \nA serpent-like road passes through the village . \nThe palm groves on either side of the road are pockmarked by bomb craters . \nA couple of thousand Sunni Arabs from one tribe live here . \nEveryone is related ; they say they can trace their history back to the prophet Muhammad . \nWomen are rarely seen in public and almost everyone is a fundamentalist Salafi Muslim . \nThe men sport big bushy beards and wear ankle-length dishdashas -LRB- robes -RRB- . \nMosques are scattered everywhere and at prayer time the place grinds to a halt . \nThere are two ways into the village . \nThe official way in takes you through a 100m-long checkpoint of blast walls , concrete barriers and barbed wire . \nIt is manned by masked Shia Iraqi soldiers from the south of the country and commanded by US soldiers . \nCars and cards are checked regularly and the roads are closed down , forcing people to drive for hours through the farmlands around the village before hitting the main road again . \nDriving in and out through this checkpoint reminds one of a second world war movie of an eastern European town under German occupation . \nThe locals call the checkpoint the Rafah crossing , in reference to the notorious checkpoint in Gaza . \nThen there is the unofficial way in . \nA narrow , bumpy farm road provides the mujahideens with safe access into the village away from the weary eyes of the Iraqi soldiers . \nThis is the road Abu Theeb took in last week . \nI went with him on condition that I did nothing to reveal his identity or the location of the village . \nFor the purposes of the assignment , I was advised to pray , fast and dress like the men of the village , although I am not religious . \nAbu Theeb was born in this village four decades ago . \nHe was one of five brothers and several sisters and his father was an illiterate farmer who went everywhere with his short-wave radio and loved to talk politics . \nIn the 80s , Abu Theeb 's eldest brother was killed fighting in the Iran-Iraq war . \nAbu Theeb studied law at university in Baghdad before joining the Institute of National Security , an elite academy reserved mostly for Sunni Arabs . \nIt was the graduates of this academy who were used to staff Saddam 's secret services ; Abu Theeb was a loyal citizen , and he went on to a job in the security services . \nBut his nationalism evaporated after Saddam 's invasion of Kuwait . \n`` I hated the government , '' he says . \n`` I realized that all that they were telling us about the nation and the leader was false . \nThey had no pride , no honor . \nI wanted to leave , to take a long break , so I left the service to do religious studies . '' \nHe joined an Islamic Sharia school to train as a cleric . \nThere he fell in love with two subjects : the teachings of Ibn Taimia , the father of the fundamentalist Salafi school of thinking , and religious politics . \nLater , however , he was obliged to return to his old job at the Amn al-Aam , the General Security , one of Saddam 's feared security apparatuses , and there he stayed until the American occupation toppled the regime . \n`` When the fall happened , I went to a cleric I knew who was preaching jihad and asked him for weapons , '' he says . \n`` I was weeping . \nHe said , ` Go away , things are too dangerous . ' \nI roamed the streets with a dagger in my pocket . \nI was too ashamed to come back home and see my family while Baghdad was under the occupation , dead bodies and bullet shells everywhere . '' \nHe finally met up with a group of Syrian volunteers in Baghdad . \nThey , like him , were looking for a fight with the Americans . \nHe brought them back to his home , he says , and formed one of the first jihadi cells . \nThey got to work . \n`` When the infidel conquers your home , it 's like seeing your women raped in front of your eyes and like your religion being insulted every day , '' says Abu Theeb . \nHe joined others and started first with direct rocket-propelled grenade hits and small arms attacks on US convoys around his area , until a fellow Salafi fighter taught him how to set an IED using primitive techniques , a TV remote control and some artillery shells . \nA visiting Iraqi army general laid the ground rules for the group : IEDs were the most successful weapon , but should always be laid at least two kilometres outside the village to spare the people the wrath of the Americans . \n`` Everyone was fighting , men who under Saddam spent years as military deserters became zealous fighters , '' says Abu Theeb . \n`` Something like fire was inside us . \nWe would go out to fight for days , leaving our families and wives behind . '' \nHe and other Salafi fighters became known as the Anger Brigade , an insurgent group that has claimed responsibility for numerous attacks on US and Iraqi targets and is involved in kidnapping those who are perceived as collaborating with the much-hated occupation . \nThis is truly a holy war for Abu Theeb . \nHe tells me how once he was driving to Baghdad carrying a sack filled with anti-tank rocket heads for an operation in Baghdad . \nHe was stopped at a checkpoint and American soldiers ordered him to step out and begun a car search . \n`` I prayed to God , '' he says . \n`` I told him , ` God , if I am doing what I am doing for your sake then spare me this . \nIf it 's not , let them get me . ' \nThe American soldier opened the boot where I had the sack filled with rocket heads . \nHe moved it aside and started to search . \nWhen he finished and asked me to leave , I knew then I was blessed by God . '' \nGod has not been so merciful with the rest of his family . \nOne of his brothers and a nephew have died fighting the Americans ; another brother was killed a month ago as he was setting an IED on the side of the road . \nBut Abu Theeb 's faith remains strong . \nFor more than two years , Abu Theeb had been taking part in insurgent attacks on US and Iraqi targets , laying IEDs , carrying out ambushes and kidnappings . \nThen , about eight months ago , a group of Syrian men visited him . \nThey identified themselves as part of the al-Qaida group in Iraq , and they asked for his cooperation in establishing a foothold for their organization in his area . \n`` They told me that they had support and money and wanted to open a new front here , '' says Abu Theeb . \n`` I said to them , ` What about the village - do you want this to become a new Fallujah ? ' '' \nAbu Theeb did n't want al-Qaida , even if their aims were ostensibly the same . \n`` When al-Qaida came here I was the first to fight it , '' he says . \n`` They went to the clerics and said , ` Denounce this man . \nIf not , your blood will be spilled . ' \nThey can kill and slaughter easily . '' \nAbu Theeb and other Salafi clerics and leaders of the insurgency north and south of Baghdad are now talking about a rift - a split between Iraqi Islamist and nationalistic insurgent groups , and the mainly foreign led and supported al-Qaida forces . \nThey say that al-Qaida initially gained support among the Sunnis because of its ferocity and meticulous planning , and because it had money pouring in from jihadis all over the Arab world . \nMade up mostly of foreign Arabs , it quickly became the most feared insurgent group in Iraq , claiming responsibility for the bloodiest attacks against not only US and Iraqi forces but also civilians . \n`` If it was n't al-Qaida fighting with the Sunnis in Iraq the whole battle would have had a different outcome , '' says Abu Hafsa , another mujahideen commander based north of Baghdad . \nAbu Qutada , a mujahideen leader based in south Baghdad , agrees . \n`` Lots of the mujahideen groups are in need of money and weapons so they join the umbrella of al-Qaida for support , '' he says . \nBut he adds : `` They differ with them in ideology . '' \nThe tipping point came when al-Qaida , known then as the Tawhid al-Jihad , decided to target the Iraqi police and army and other Iraqi ministries and institutions . \nIts goal was to prevent the Americans establishing an Iraqi state that could lead the fight against the insurgency - and allow the Americans to take a back seat . \n`` They have experience in fighting and they did very clever stuff , '' says Abu Theeb . \n`` They attacked all the centres of the Iraqi state and prevented the Americans from creating a puppet state that they could hand everything to . \nThe Iraqi resistance was occupied by fighting the Americans and could n't see that strategic goal . '' \nPerhaps inevitably , though , the insurgents turned out not to have the same stomach for Iraqi blood . \n`` Al-Qaida believes that anyone who does n't follow the Qur ` an literally is a Kaffir - apostate - and should be killed , '' says Abu Theeb . \n`` This is wrong . '' \nAl-Qaida marked down not only those who cooperated with the American occupation , but everyone who worked with the Iraqi government , police or army , as Kaffirs . \nThen they said that the entire Shia community were Kaffirs . \nFor Sunnis like Abu Theeb , this was a step too far . \nThe second serious stumbling block has been al-Qaida 's call for the establishment of an Islamic state -LRB- caliphate -RRB- based on the Taliban model in Afghanistan . \nThis has already started taking place in towns and villages where al-Qaida is dominant . \n`` The resistance now is made up of nationalist and religious elements , '' says Abu Theeb . \n`` By calling for a caliphate you will alienate not only the resistance but the support we get from Syria and the gulf countries . '' \nThe last thing these countries want is a Taliban state as a neighbor . \nAl-Qaida 's policies have drawn a furious response from the Iraqi security forces and the Shia militias , and it is Sunnis who have suffered . \nScores have been executed after being kidnapped by paramilitary units . \nIn Abu Theeb 's area alone , more than 300 Sunni families have taken refuge after fleeing Shia areas in Baghdad . \n`` Every time al-Qaida attacks a Shia mosque we are making all the Shias our enemies , '' he says . \n`` We are cementing them against us . '' \nLater he says : `` We have lost more men to the Shias than we have lost to the Americans . '' \nThis rift in the insurgency has already gone far beyond angry words . \nClashes erupted between al-Qaida fighters and Iraqi mujahideen cells after al-Qaida killed a group of Iraqi insurgents who they claimed were spying for the Americans . \nBack in the village , politics has become a hot issue . \nEverywhere - in the mosques after prayers , at weddings , in the main market and in private mujahideen circles - the talk is of politics . \nAbu Theeb says his move into politics has come at a price : he has had to shave off his beard so that he can visit Baghdad . \nFor weeks he has been traveling , visiting houses , urging people to register to vote . \n`` It 's a new jihad , '' he says . \n`` There is time for fighting and a time for politics . '' \nI went back to the school with Abu Theeb on polling day . \nThere was a festival atmosphere . \nTwo of his guards were already at their positions , but the rest were more relaxed - their weapons lay against the wall and on tables . \n`` No one will attack , '' said Abu Theeb . \nInside the classroom that had become the polling station , an old sheik sat on a wooden bench . \n`` The judge and the monitors did n't come from Baghdad - they said this is a hot area - so the sheik of the village is going be the monitor , '' said Abu Theeb . \nPeople began to trickle in . \nThe officials present soon decided that it was not realistic to expect the women to come in , so each man who came in with an ID card was given a whole stack of ballot papers . \n`` Nine papers to Haji Abu Hussein , '' shouted a registration official . \nAnother official sitting on another table handed Haji Abu Hussein the nine ballots . \nThe man took his ballots , but instead of voting in private in the ballot box , he publicly ticked the `` no '' boxes , folded the papers , and then chucked them in the box . \nBy midday people had stopped coming and the officials started ticking the boxes on ballot papers themselves . \nThe next day , America and the authorities were crowing about how well the referendum had gone ; yesterday - after a `` yes '' vote had been returned - leading Sunni politicians accused the Shia in the south of stuffing ballot boxes . \nWell , some of the Sunnis in the north are certainly guilty of it . \nTwo days after the balloting , Abu Theeb and two other clerics sat on the floor of a mosque debating the political future of their group and the Sunnis in general . \n`` We should keep all the options open , '' Abu Theeb told them . \nEven a coalition with the enemy . \n"}

{"id": "326", "time": "2005-07-08", "text": "Friday 8 July 2005 15.01 BST During the last phase of the Troubles , the IRA targeted mainland Britain : it came close to blowing up Margaret Thatcher and her cabinet in Brighton . \nSome years later a missile was fired at No 10 . \nLondon 's financial quarter was also targeted . \nThere was no secret as to the identity of the organization that carried out the hits or its demands . \nAnd all this happened despite the various Prevention of Terrorism Acts passed by the Commons . \nThe bombers who targeted London yesterday are anonymous . \nIt is assumed that those who carried out these attacks are linked to al-Qaida . \nWe simply do not know . \nAl-Qaida is not the only terrorist group in existence . \nIt has rivals within the Muslim diaspora . \nBut it is safe to assume that the cause of these bombs is the unstinting support given by New Labor and its prime minister to the US wars in Afghanistan and Iraq . \nOne of the arguments deployed by Ken Livingstone , the mayor of London , when he appealed to Tony Blair not to support the war in Iraq was prescient : `` An assault on Iraq will inflame world opinion and jeopardise security and peace everywhere . \nLondon , as one of the major world cities , has a great deal to lose from war and a lot to gain from peace , international cooperation and global stability . '' \nMost Londoners -LRB- as the rest of the country -RRB- were opposed to the Iraq war . \nTragically , they have suffered the blow and paid the price for the re-election of Blair and a continuation of the war . \nEver since 9\\/11 , I have been arguing that the `` war against terror '' is immoral and counterproductive . \nIt sanctions the use of state terror - bombing raids , torture , countless civilian deaths in Afghanistan and Iraq - against Islamo-anarchists whose numbers are small , but whose reach is deadly . \nThe solution then , as now , is political , not military . \nThe British ruling elite understood this perfectly well in the case of Ireland . \nSecurity measures , anti-terror laws rushed through parliament , identity cards , a curtailment of civil liberties , will not solve the problem . \nIf anything , they will push young Muslims in the direction of mindless violence . \nThe real solution lies in immediately ending the occupation of Iraq , Afghanistan and Palestine . \nJust because these three wars are reported sporadically and mean little to the everyday lives of most Europeans does not mean the anger and bitterness they arouse in the Muslim world and its diaspora is insignificant . \nAs long as western politicians wage their wars and their colleagues in the Muslim world watch in silence , young people will be attracted to the groups who carry out random acts of revenge . \nAt the beginning of the G8 , Blair suggested that `` poverty was the cause of terrorism '' . \nIt is not so . \nThe principal cause of this violence is the violence being inflicted on the people of the Muslim world . \nAnd unless this is recognized , the horrors will continue . \nTariq Ali 's latest book is Speaking of Empire and Resistance . \n"}
{"id": "253", "time": "2005-07-08", "text": "The struggle against terrorism can not be won by military means The G8 must seize the opportunity to address the wider issues at the root of such atrocities Friday 8 July 2005 15.00 BST I have rarely seen the Commons so full and so silent as when it met yesterday to hear of the London bombings . \nA forum that often is raucous and rowdy was solemn and grave . \nA chamber that normally is a bear pit of partisan emotions was united in shock and sorrow . \nEven Ian Paisley made a humane plea to the press not to repeat the offence that occurred in Northern Ireland when journalists demanded comment from relatives before they were informed that their loved ones were dead . \nThe immediate response to such human tragedy must be empathy with the pain of those injured and the grief of those bereaved . \nWe recoil more deeply from loss of life in such an atrocity because we know the unexpected disappearance of partners , children and parents must be even harder to bear than a natural death . \nIt is sudden , and therefore there is no farewell or preparation for the blow . \nAcross London today there are relatives whose pain may be more acute because they never had the chance to offer or hear last words of affection . \nIt is arbitrary and therefore an event that changes whole lives , which turn on the accident of momentary decisions . \nHow many people this morning ask themselves how different it might have been if their partner had taken the next bus or caught an earlier tube ? \nBut perhaps the loss is hardest to bear because it is so difficult to answer the question why it should have happened . \nThis weekend we will salute the heroism of the generation that defended Britain in the last war . \nIn advance of the commemoration there have been many stories told of the courage of those who risked their lives and sometimes lost their lives to defeat fascism . \nThey provide moving , humbling examples of what the human spirit is capable , but at least the relatives of the men and women who died then knew what they were fighting for . \nWhat purpose is there to yesterday 's senseless murders ? \nWho could possibly imagine that they have a cause that might profit from such pointless carnage ? \nAt the time of writing , no group has surfaced even to explain why they launched the assault . \nSometime over the next few days we may be offered a website entry or a video message attempting to justify the impossible , but there is no language that can supply a rational basis for such arbitrary slaughter . \nThe explanation , when it is offered , is likely to rely not on reason but on the declaration of an obsessive fundamentalist identity that leaves no room for pity for victims who do not share that identity . \nYesterday the prime minister described the bombings as an attack on our values as a society . \nIn the next few days we should remember that among those values are tolerance and mutual respect for those from different cultural and ethnic backgrounds . \nOnly the day before , London was celebrating its coup in winning the Olympic Games , partly through demonstrating to the world the success of our multicultural credentials . \nNothing would please better those who planted yesterday 's bombs than for the atrocity to breed suspicion and hostility to minorities in our own community . \nDefeating the terrorists also means defeating their poisonous belief that peoples of different faiths and ethnic origins can not coexist . \nIn the absence of anyone else owning up to yesterday 's crimes , we will be subjected to a spate of articles analyzing the threat of militant Islam . \nIronically they will fall in the same week that we recall the tenth anniversary of the massacre at Srebrenica , when the powerful nations of Europe failed to protect 8,000 Muslims from being annihilated in the worst terrorist act in Europe of the past generation . \nOsama bin Laden is no more a true representative of Islam than General Mladic , who commanded the Serbian forces , could be held up as an example of Christianity . \nAfter all , it is written in the Qur ` an that we were made into different peoples not that we might despise each other , but that we might understand each other . \nBin Laden was , though , a product of a monumental miscalculation by western security agencies . \nThroughout the 80s he was armed by the CIA and funded by the Saudis to wage jihad against the Russian occupation of Afghanistan . \nAl-Qaida , literally `` the database '' , was originally the computer file of the thousands of mujahideen who were recruited and trained with help from the CIA to defeat the Russians . \nInexplicably , and with disastrous consequences , it never appears to have occurred to Washington that once Russia was out of the way , Bin Laden 's organization would turn its attention to the west . \nThe danger now is that the west 's current response to the terrorist threat compounds that original error . \nSo long as the struggle against terrorism is conceived as a war that can be won by military means , it is doomed to fail . \nThe more the west emphasises confrontation , the more it silences moderate voices in the Muslim world who want to speak up for cooperation . \nSuccess will only come from isolating the terrorists and denying them support , funds and recruits , which means focusing more on our common ground with the Muslim world than on what divides us . \nThe G8 summit is not the best-designed forum in which to launch such a dialogue with Muslim countries , as none of them is included in the core membership . \nNor do any of them make up the outer circle of select emerging economies , such as China , Brazil and India , which are also invited to Gleneagles . \nWe are not going to address the sense of marginalisation among Muslim countries if we do not make more of an effort to be inclusive of them in the architecture of global governance . \nBut the G8 does have the opportunity in its communique today to give a forceful response to the latest terrorist attack . \nThat should include a statement of their joint resolve to hunt down those who bear responsibility for yesterday 's crimes . \nBut it must seize the opportunity to address the wider issues at the root of terrorism . \nIn particular , it would be perverse if the focus of the G8 on making poverty history was now obscured by yesterday 's bombings . \nThe breeding grounds of terrorism are to be found in the poverty of back streets , where fundamentalism offers a false , easy sense of pride and identity to young men who feel denied of any hope or any economic opportunity for themselves . \nA war on world poverty may well do more for the security of the west than a war on terror . \nAnd in the privacy of their extensive suites , yesterday 's atrocities should prompt heart-searching among some of those present . \nPresident Bush is given to justifying the invasion of Iraq on the grounds that by fighting terrorism abroad , it protects the west from having to fight terrorists at home . \nWhatever else can be said in defense of the war in Iraq today , it can not be claimed that it has protected us from terrorism on our soil . \n"}
{"id": "137", "time": "2005-04-17", "text": "` Everyone should know about it ' Are today 's young people as ignorant of history as we fear ? \nWe asked Six London teenagers to tell us about the war ... Sixty years on from the end of war in Europe , how much do today 's teenagers actually know about the events surrounding the Second World War ? \nIf popular opinion is to be believed , not a lot . \nWe decided to put this assumption to the test by gathering together a panel of six London teenagers to discuss what they know about the war and what it means to them today . \nOur team are : Lebbie Larbi , 16 , Efe Olokpa , 17 , Marlin Khondoker , 17 and Jessie McGavin , 17 - who were all born and live in London . \nBulgarian-born Iva Kazalova , 17 , moved to London with her family about 18 months ago and Enrique Grande , 17 , is from Madrid and is in the UK on a one-year exchange . \nEnrique 's passion is international politics , while Lebbie likes football , basketball and table tennis ; Efe and Iva are into reading , socialising and listening to music ; Jessie loves films and wants to travel ; and Marlin likes history and her cat , Peanut . \nWhat do you know about the Second World War ? \nLebbie Larbi : Over 60 million people died . \nEfe Olokpa : Although the war ended in , like , Europe , there was still the war in the Far East , in the Pacific , with the US and Japan . \nIva Kazalova : I know that over 6 million Jews died . \nEnrique Grande : Germany was blamed for the whole war , and Japan as well . \nMarlin Khondoker : Germany was upset about the Versailles Treaty and they retaliated after they were treated so badly . \nJessie McGavin : VE Day was on 8 May . \nVJ Day , the victory against Japan , was later , in September . \nWhat countried were involved in the war and when did it begin ? \nEnrique : I think when Great Britain declared war on Germany was when the Germans invaded Poland in 1939 , was n't it ? \nThen basically the States and everyone joined the Allies and everything started . \nThere were two main sides , there was the Allies , France , Great Britain , the States , and Russia . \nThen there was Germany and their partner . \nEfe : Well the USA did n't really join the war , but ... Efe : ... when Japan bombed them ... Marlin : They sort of supported from the sidelines , they gave money to help . \nEfe : Yeah , but they were n't really in it until Japan bombed Pearl Harbour . \nHow do you find out about these events ? \nEfe : Well recently there was that thing on television about the Second World War in color . \nMarlin : Occasionally the teachers recommend watching something like the documentary on Auschwitz . \nJessie : We touch on things about the war in other subjects too , like RE when we used to have general discussions . \nYou pick up things that way . \nWas the war fought for a good cause and was Germany fighting for an evil one ? \nLebbie : I think it was a good cause . \nIf the Germans had won I would n't be here . \nThe Germans wanted blond-haired , blue-eyed people , and I 'm not blond-haired and blue-eyed ! \nJessie : I do n't know , I do n't think you can ever say it 's just the goodies and the baddies . \nI think you have to look deeper . \nOn the whole , though , it was good that the war happened against Germany and that Germany did n't win . \nEnrique : They were suggesting that we should kill some races just because they thought they were superior to them . \nThey were suggesting we should get rid of disabled people , mentally incapable people , things like that . \nI think it was a good cause to fight against them . \nI do n't think it was good that so many people died , but it 's better than having Hitler for 80 years . \nDo you think of the Iraq war in the same terms as the Second World War ? \nJessie : The Iraq war does n't seem like a war to me at all . \nI think that it 's good that the Second World War happened and that the Germans did n't win . \nWhereas I do n't think the Iraq war should have gone ahead at all . \nEnrique : There were two sides in the Second World War and they were roughly equally powerful in everything . \nIn the Iraq war you basically had the States and some other countries crushing these poor people with AK-47s , and they have really powerful guns and planes and everything so I do n't think it 's a war , it 's not fair , it 's not a fair fight . \nEfe : Is n't a war supposed to end and it has n't really ended ? \nThey say it 's war and people are dying but there is n't really a reason why ... Iva : You can relate Iraq to the Second World War because it 's something so global , it makes you think ... It 's something that everyone should reflect on . \nIt 's the same today , even though we should have learned from the Second World War , with all the extremists and the American invasion and everything ... Lebbie : I agree . \nWe get a broader view of the war than other people who do n't know about the Second World War . \nWhat was life like after the war ? \nJessie : I think it was still hard , I mean it did n't just end , and everyone was happy and there was plenty to eat . \nThere was still rationing and they were still fighting . \nEven after VE Day . \nThere was n't really a cut-off point . \nEnrique : Japan and the United States carried on fighting for quite a long time . \nThey said officially the war was over , but there was still fighting . \nHow do you think being invoved in the war affected the lives of the people living here ? \nJessie : I think everyone had a member of their family who died or at least everyone knew someone who had died . \nIt was very real with the Blitz in London . \nBut even though it was really depressing , people were better off during the war . \nEveryone had a sort of aim and that was lost when the war ended . \nMarlin : Because the men were away fighting , everyone bonded together , people had to work together a lot more . \nThe war brought more independence for women as well so there was more of a community then than there is now . \nDo you think people were n't totally aware of what was going on ? \nIva : Everyone was stuck to their radios , it was a major thing , everyone fought in it . \nObviously today everyone cares about the Iraq war , but it 's not like we 're really participating in it . \nWe are definitely more informed with television and newspapers and the internet today . \nMarlin : I think we get both perspectives now . \nBefore , if you were in Britain they would have shown Britain as the winning side and they would n't have shown anything bad that was going on in Germany , what they 'd inflicted , kind of thing . \nBefore the war started they would 've been excited to be fighting for their country . \nNow , at the start of the Iraq war , we did all those protests and marches against it rather than for it . \nJessie : There 's more confusion as to who 's the good side and who 's the bad side today . \nEnrique : Germany was doing something bad to Poland , that 's why all the countries felt they should help . \nBut what was Iraq doing ? \nWhy are the States at war there ? \nIt was more clear-cut in the Second World War . \nJessie : It 's easier to be against war today . \nHow will you celebrate on 8 May and do you think you should celebrate ? \nEfe : Maybe in my own special way . \nI 'll read the newspaper that day . \nIva : At the time it must have been such a relief to know the war was finally ending . \nToday I think we should pay some sort of tribute , I mean more like quiet reflection . \nI do n't think it 's something we should drink to . \nIt should make you think about what 's going on in the world today . \nJessie : The deaths of all those people is not something to celebrate . \nMarlin : It 's a celebration of peace is n't it . \nLike at the end of the war . \nLebbie : It depends how you see it . \nIt is a celebration of the end of a horrible war . \nThat 's why people party and drink because it 's a celebration of life . \nDo you think the Second World War should be kept in people 's minds ? \nLebbie : You ca n't force people to know about it , but if they choose to know about it there should be the resources available . \nEnrique : I disagree . \nEveryone should know a bit about it so we can avoid it happening again . \nIf everyone knows what happened , if everyone knows what 's going on , we could avoid it in the future . \nMarlin : Our school does encourage us . \nThey brought in a speaker once who was a survivor of Auschwitz . \nHe talked to us in assembly . \nIva : It will fade away . \nThere are just fewer and fewer memories and less personal experience to be told . \nEnrique : We 're studying the Nazis in Germany and a lot of people do n't know what happened in Germany just before the war . \nWe 've been to Berlin and basically people just blank it out . \nThey act like it did n't happen , but our teacher gave a talk about her family in early Nazi Germany and it 's something we would n't get to know otherwise . \nIt was shocking because it 's the sort of thing that textbooks do n't tell you and people in Germany would never tell you . \nI think that 's a good way of keeping history going and getting people to know about it because otherwise we would forget about it . \nI do n't think we should forget about what happened . \n"}
{"id": "269", "time": "2005-04-28", "text": "Thursday 28 April 2005 13.03 BST The head of the United Nations weapons inspectors in the run-up to the Iraq war , Hans Blix , last night undercut one of the main grounds offered by the attorney general , Lord Goldsmith , in his legal advice to Tony Blair . \nLord Goldsmith said there would have to be evidence that Iraq was not complying with the inspectors . \nBut Mr Blix , who has since retired to Sweden , said his inspectors found no compelling evidence that Iraq had a hidden arsenal or was blocking the work of the inspectors . \nHe said there had been only small infractions by Iraq . \n`` We did express ourselves in dry terms but there was no mistake about the content , '' he said . \n`` One can not say there was compelling evidence . \nIraq was guilty only of small infractions . \nThe government should have re-evaluated its assessment in the light of what the inspectors found . \n`` We reported consistently that we found no weapons of mass destruction and I carried out inspections at sites given to us by US and British intelligence and not found anything . '' \nIn a key passage in the legal advice written by Lord Goldsmith on March 7 2003 , the attorney general said that UN resolution 1441 could only be sustainable as a justification for war `` if there are strong factual grounds for concluding that Iraq has failed to take the final opportunity . \nIn other words , we would need to be able to demonstrate hard evidence of non-compliance and non-cooperation . '' \nHe said the views of Unmovic , the UN inspectorate body , and the International Atomic Energy Agency , the UN nuclear watchdog , will be `` highly significant '' and `` you will need to consider very carefully whether the evidence of non-cooperation and non-compliance by Iraq is sufficiently compelling '' . \nMr Blix and his team returned to Iraq in December 2002 after a four-year absence and remained until the week before war began in March 2003 . \nMore than 200 inspectors crisscrossed Iraq , checking out possible sites for the production or stockpiling of weapons of mass destruction : chemical , biological or nuclear . \nMr Blix 's first monthly report to the UN security council in January was mainly negative about the Iraqi government , complaining about lack of cooperation . \nA month later he adopted a more neutral stance , pointing out some infringements but finding no significant stockpiles . \nOn March 7 , the day Lord Goldsmith drew up his report , Mr Blix gave his final report and this was the most favourable yet from Iraq 's point of view . \nAsked if this final report amounted to the compelling evidence that Lord Goldsmith considered crucial , Mr Blix said : `` One can not say so . \nThere were infractions , you can say . \nIn March , they -LRB- the Iraqis -RRB- cooperated like hell . \nIn December and January , no. . \nThat is why I gave a critical account on January 27 . \nIn February , it was more balanced . '' \nOn March 7 , Mr Blix pleaded for more time to complete his mission and reported that lethal weapons such as Samoud 2 missiles were being destroyed . \nMr Blix said last night : `` The things found were all small things . \nWe found dozens of munitions for chemical weapons . \nThey were empty and in a site declared . \nIn relation to Samoud that went beyond 150 kilometres , they -LRB- the US and Britain -RRB- said it was beyond the permitted limit but I did not feel particularly indignant about that . '' \nOn the same day , the head of the IAEA , Mohamed ElBaradei , reported that there was no evidence that Saddam Hussein had any nuclear weapons or was in the process of acquiring them . \nMr Blix said : `` By then , Mohamed ElBaradei revealed that Niger was not authentic . '' \nBritish intelligence falsely claimed Iraq had been trying to acquire uranium from Niger . \nMr Blix said Mr ElBaradei had also challenged US claims that aluminium tubes found were for WMD purposes . \nMr Blix himself also expressed scepticism to the US secretary of state , Colin Powell , about alleged evidence of WMD . \nThe Iraq Survey Group , set up by the US to search for WMD , found none . \nIn Britain , inquiries into the route to war have been held by MPs , Lord Hutton and Lord Butler . \nThe intelligence service was criticised for not re-evaluating its assessments in the light of Mr Blix 's reports . \n"}
{"id": "13", "time": "2005-04-28", "text": "Attorney general feared court challenge Weapons evidence was crucial Thursday 28 April 2005 12.48 BST Tony Blair was told by the government 's most senior law officer in a confidential minute less than two weeks before the war that British participation in the American-led invasion of Iraq could be declared illegal . \nIn a legal opinion Mr Blair has repeatedly refused to publish and never seen by the cabinet , Lord Goldsmith , the attorney general , spelled out the dangers of going to war , including the prospect of Britain losing a case in an international court . \nHe warned that while he could argue a `` reasonable case '' in favor of military action , he was not confident a court would agree . \nIndeed , a court `` might well conclude '' that a new UN resolution was needed before military action could be undertaken . \nThe attorney general warned Mr Blair that Britain might be able to argue it could go to war on the basis of past UN resolutions , but only if there were `` strong factual grounds '' that Iraq was still in breach of its disarmament obligations . \nLord Goldsmith 's 13-page minute was sent to Mr Blair on March 7 2003 . \nOn that day , Hans Blix , the chief UN weapons inspector , declared that Iraq had made `` substantial '' progress in destroying its long-range missiles , and he had found no evidence of biological or chemical weapons . \nThe fact that Lord Goldsmith 's legal opinion was not seen by the cabinet is an apparent breach of the official code covering ministerial behavior . \nIt is in contrast to the parliamentary answer issued by Lord Goldsmith 10 days later , which was shown to the cabinet . \nIn his answer , which contained none of the earlier caveats , he said it was `` plain '' that Iraq was in breach of its UN disarmament obligations . \nLord Goldsmith last night said he stood by his opinion that it was legal for Britain to go to war in Iraq . \nThe document `` stood up '' the govern ment 's case that he had not changed his opinion between giving Mr Blair private advice on March 7 and his statement to parliament . \nIn a statement , he said the document showed how he had gone through the complex arguments over the legality of military action before concluding that it would be lawful . \n`` The document ... so far from standing up the case of the government 's critics , stands up the case the government has been making all along . \n`` Contrary to the allegations that have persistently been made , it does not say the war was unlawful but confirms the conclusion I reached was that a sufficient basis for the use of force was established without a second resolution . '' \nIn 2003 , Lord Goldsmith asked Downing Street for Mr Blair 's view . \nNo 10 replied that it was `` indeed , the prime minister 's unequivocal view '' that Iraq was still in breach . \nBut , according to extracts from his confidential minute of March 7 , the attorney general warned Mr Blair : `` The language of resolution 1441 -LRB- the last UN resolution on Iraq before the war -RRB- leaves the position unclear '' ; `` I remain of the opinion that the safest legal course would be to secure the adoption of a further resolution to authorise the use of force '' ; `` We would need to be able to demonstrate hard evidence of -LRB- Iraqi -RRB- non-compliance and non-cooperation '' ; `` In the light of the latest reporting by Unmovic -LRB- UN weapons inspectors -RRB- you will need to consider very carefully whether the evidence of non-cooperation and non-compliance by Iraq is sufficiently compelling to justify the conclusion that Iraq has failed to take its final opportunity '' . \nAccording to the Butler report on the use of intelligence in the run-up to war , ministers failed to ask Britain 's intelligence agencies to look again at their assessments of Iraq 's weapons program despite the UN inspectors ' failure to find any . \nIn his minute , Lord Goldsmith revealed that his predecessors had advised that the legality of British bombing of Iraq in Operation Desert Fox in 1998 , and of Kosovo the following year , was `` no more than reasonably arguable '' . \nIn a pointed warning to the prime minister , he added : `` But a ` reasonable case ' does not mean that if the matter ever came before a court I would be confident that the court would agree with the view . '' \nA court `` might well conclude '' , Lord Goldsmith said , that the wording of resolution 1441 required a second resolution to trigger military action . \nA `` counter view '' could be reasonably maintained , Lord Goldsmith said . \n`` However , it must be recognized that on previous occasions when military action was taken on the basis of a reasonably arguable case , the degree of public and parliamentary scrutiny of the legal issue was nothing as great as it is today . '' \nHe also dismissed the government 's claim that by threatening to veto a new UN resolution France was behaving unreasonably , and this somehow negated the need for a new resolution : `` As I have said before , I do not believe that there is any basis in law for arguing that there is an implied condition of reason ableness which can be read into the power of veto conferred on the permanent members of the security council by the UN charter . '' \n`` In any event , '' he added , `` if the majority of world opinion remains opposed to military action , it is likely to be difficult on the facts to categorise a French veto as ` unreasonable ' . '' \nThe disclosure of extracts was seized on last night by constitutional experts as well as opposition politicians . \nAnthony Lester QC , a Liberal Democrat peer , described it as a `` devastating blow to the government 's credibility '' . \nPeter Hennessy , a professor of political history at London University , said : `` The whole thing reeks . \nEven if the prime minister wins handsomely on polling day this will stain him and his premiership as long as people remember it , just as Anthony Eden 's name isforever associated with the Suez crisis . '' \nThe Liberal Democrat leader , Charles Kennedy , said : `` What is abundantly clear is not only that the prime minister made the wrong political judgment but he went about justifying that judgment in a seriously misleading way .

{"id": "151", "time": "2005-04-28", "text": "Full text : Iraq legal advice -LRB- part two -RRB- The full text of the advice about the legality of war with Iraq given by the attorney general , Lord Goldsmith , to the prime minister , Tony Blair , on March 7 2003 . \nRead the first part of the advice Thursday 28 April 2005 18.46 BST 20 . \nIt has also been suggested that the final words of OP4 were chosen carefully to avoid the implication that it was for the Security Council to assess whether Iraqi conduct constituted a further material breach . \nThe French proposed to amend OP4 so that Iraqi conduct would only amount to a further material breach `` when assessed '' as such by the Council , but this amendment was not accepted . \nI am not wholly convinced by this argument : if , for the reasons discussed in paragraph 17 above , OP4 requires an assessment of Iraq 's conduct by the Council , the alternative language makes little difference . \nHowever , I do accept that the negotiating history indicates that the words at the end of OP4 `` and shall be reported to the Council for assessment in accordance with paragraphs 11 and 12 '' were added at a late stage , but in substitution for other language which would clearly have had the effect of making any finding of further material breach subject to a further Council decision . \nWhether a report comes to the Council under OP4 or OP11 , the critical issue is what action the Council is required to take at that point . \nIn other words , what does OP12 require . \nIt is clear that the language of OP12 was a compromise by the US from their starting position that the Council should authorise in advance the use of all necessary means to enforce the ceasefire resolution in the event of continued violations by Iraq . \nIt is equally clear , however , that the language does not expressly provide that a further Council decision is necessary to authorise the use of force . \nThe paragraph indicates that in the event of a report of a further material breach -LRB- whether under OP4 or OP11 -RRB- there will be a meeting of the Council to consider the situation and the need for compliance in order to secure international peace and security . \nThe Council thus has the opportunity to take a further decision expressly authorising the use of force or , conceivably , to decide that other enforcement means should be used . \nBut the Council might fail to act . \nThe resolution does not state what is to happen in those circumstances . \nThe clear US view is that , whatever the reason for the Council 's failure to act , the determination of material breach in OPs 1 and 4 would remain valid , thus authorising the use of force without a further decision . \nMy view is that different considerations apply in different circumstances . \nThe OP12 discussion might make clear that the Council 's view is that military action is appropriate but that no further decision is required because of the terms of resolution 1441 . \nIn such a case , there would be good grounds for relying on the existing resolution as the legal basis for any subsequent military action . \nThe more difficult scenario is if the views of Council members are divided and a further resolution is not adopted either because it fails to attract 9 votes or because it is vetoed . \nThe principal argument in favor of the view that no further decision is required to authorise force in these circumstances is that the language of OP12 -LRB- ie `` consider '' -RRB- was chosen deliberately to indicate the need for a further discussion , but not a decision . \nAs I have indicated , it is contended that this interpretation is supported by the negotiating history . \nThe French and Russians both made proposals to amend OP12 to include an express requirement for a further decision , but these proposals were not accepted . \nThe US Administration insist that they made clear throughout that they would not accept a text which subjected the use of force to a further Council decision . \nThe French -LRB- and others -RRB- therefore knew what they were voting for . \nThe US are confident that in accepting OPs 4 and 12 , they were conceding a Council discussion and no more . \nThe US , of course , approached the negotiation of resolution 1441 from a different starting point because , as I explained in paragraph 9 above , they have always taken the view that `` material breach '' is a matter of objective fact and does not require a Security Council determination . \n-LRB- By contrast , the UK position taken on the advice of successive Law Officers , has been that it is for the Security Council to determine the existence of a material breach of the ceasefire . -RRB- \nTherefore , while the US objective was to ensure that the resolution did not constrain the right of action which they believed they already had , our objective was to secure a sufficient authorisation from the Council in the absence of which we would have had no right to act . \nI have considered whether this difference in the underlying legal view means that the effect of the resolution might be different for the US than for the UK , but I have concluded that it does not affect the position . \nIf OP12 of the resolution , properly interpreted , were to mean that a further Council decision was required before force was authorised , this would constrain the US just as much as the UK . \nIt was therefore an essential negotiating point for the US that the resolution should not concede the need for a second resolution . \nThey are convinced that they succeeded . \nI was impressed by the strength and sincerity of the views of the US Administration which I heard in Washington on this point . \nHowever , the difficulty is that we are reliant on their assertions for the view that the French -LRB- and others -RRB- knew and accepted that they were voting for a further discussion and no more . \nWe have very little hard evidence of this beyond a couple of telegrams recording admissions by French negotiators that they knew the US would not accept a resolution which required a further Council decision . \nThe possibility remains that the French and others accepted OP12 because in their view it gave them a sufficient basis on which to argue that a second resolution was required -LRB- even if that was not made expressly clear -RRB- . \nA further difficulty is that , if the matter ever came before a court , it is very uncertain to what extent the court would accept evidence of the negotiating history to support a particular interpretation of the resolution , given that most of the negotiations were conducted in private and there are no agreed or official records . \nThe counter view of OP12 is that this paragraph must imply a decision by the Council . \nThree particular arguments support that approach : -LRB- i -RRB- when taken with the word `` assessment '' in OP4 , the language of OP12 indicates that the Council will be assessing the seriousness of any Iraqi breach ; this is especially powerful if in truth some assessment is necessary ; -LRB- ii -RRB- there is a special significance in the words `` in order to secure international peace and security '' . \nThey reflect not only the special responsibility of the Security Council under Article 39 of the UN Charter -LRB- `` The Security Council shall determine the existence of any threat to the peace , breach of the peace , or acts of aggression and shall make recommendations , or decide what measures shall be taken ... to maintain or restore international peace and security '' -RRB- , but also pick up the language of both resolution 678 -LRB- which authorised the use of force `` to restore international peace and security in the area '' -RRB- and resolution 687 -LRB- which referred to the objective of `` restoring international peace and security in the area as set out in its recent resolutions '' -RRB- . \nThe clear inference , it will be argued , is that this shows the Council was to exercise a deliberative role on that issue , ie to determine what it is necessary to secure international peace and security ; -LRB- iii -RRB- any other construction reduces the role of the Council discussion under OP12 to a procedural formality . \nOthers have jibbed at this categorisation , but I remain of the opinion that this would be the effect in legal terms of the view that no further resolution is required . \nThe Council would be required to meet , and all members of the Council would be under an obligation to participate in the discussion in good faith , but even if an overwhelming majority of the Council were opposed to the use of force , military action could proceed regardless . \nWhere the meaning of a resolution is unclear from the text , the statements made by members of the Council at the time of its adoption may be taken into account in order to ascertain the Council 's intentions . \nThe statements made during the debate on 8 November 2002 are not , however , conclusive . \nThe US and UK stated that further breaches would be reported to the Council `` for discussion '' . \nJeremy Greenstock then added that we would then expect the Council to `` meet its responsibilities '' , although -LRB- implicitly -RRB- we would be prepared to act without Council backing to ensure that the task of disarmament is completed . \nOnly the US explicitly stated that it believed that the resolution did not constrain the use of force by States `` to enforce relevant United Nations resolutions and protect world peace and security '' regardless of whether there was a further Council decision . \nConversely , two other Council members , Mexico and Ireland , made clear that in their view a further decision of the Council was required before the use of force would be authorised . \nSyria also stated that `` the resolution should not be interpreted , through certain paragraphs , as authorising any State to use force '' . \nMost other Council members were less clear in their comments . \nThe joint statement of France , Russia and China is somewhat opaque , but seems to imply that a further decision is required . \nMany delegations welcomed the fact that there was `` no automaticity '' in the resolution with regard to the use of force . \nBut it is not clear what they meant by this . \nIt could indicate that they did not consider that the resolution authorised the use of force in any circumstances by means of the revival argument . \nOn the other hand there is some evidence from the negotiating history that their main concern was that the resolution should not authorise force immediately following its adoption -LRB- last four words underlined -RRB- on the basis of `` material breach '' in OP1 plus `` serious consequences '' in OP13 . \nThe UK and US indicated that `` no automaticity '' meant that there would be a Council discussion before force was used . \nTo sum up , the language of resolution 1441 leaves the position unclear and the statements made on adoption of the resolution suggest that there were differences of view within the Council as to the legal effect of the resolution . \nArguments can be made on both sides . \nA key question is whether there is in truth a need for an assessment of whether Iraq 's conduct constitutes a failure to take the final opportunity or has constituted a failure fully to cooperate within the meaning of OP4 such that the basis of the ceasefire is destroyed . \nIf an assessment is needed of that sort , it would be for the Council to make it . \nA narrow textual reading of the resolution suggests that sort of assessment is not needed , because the Council has pre-determined the issue . \nPublic statements , on the other hand , say otherwise . \nIn these circumstances , I remain of the opinion that the safest legal course would be to secure the adoption of a further resolution to authorise the use of force . \nI have already advised that I do not believe that such a resolution need be explicit in its terms . \nThe key point is that it should establish that the Council has conduced that Iraq has failed to take the final opportunity offered by resolution 1441 , as in the draft which has already been tabled . \nNevertheless , having regard to the information on the negotiating history which I have been given and to the arguments of the US Administration which I heard in Washington , I accept that a reasonable case can be made that resolution 1441 is capable in principle of reviving the authorisation in 678 without a further resolution . \nHowever , the argument that resolution 1441 alone has revived the authorisation to use force in resolution 678 will only be sustainable if there are strong factual grounds for concluding that Iraq has failed to take the final opportunity . \nIn other words , we would need to be able to demonstrate hard evidence of non-compliance and non-cooperation . \nGiven the structure of the resolution as a whole , the views of UNMOVIC and the IAEA will be highly significant in this respect . \nIn the light of the latest reporting by UNMOVIC , you will need to consider extremely carefully whether the evidence of non-cooperation and non-compliance by Iraq is sufficiently compelling to justify the conclusion that Iraq has failed to take its final opportunity . \nIn reaching my conclusions , I have taken account of the fact that on a number of previous occasions , including in relation to Operation Desert Fox in December 1998 and Kosovo in 1999 , UK forces have participated in military action on the basis of advice from my predecessors that the legality of the action under international law was no more than reasonably arguable . \nBut a `` reasonable case '' does not mean that if the matter ever came before a court I would be confident that the court would agree with this view . \nI judge that , having regard to the arguments on both sides , and considering the resolution as a whole in the light of the statements made on adoption and subsequently , a court might well conclude that OPs 4 and 12 do require a further Council decision in order to revive the authorisation in resolution 678 . \nBut equally I consider that the counter view can be reasonably maintained . \nHowever , it must be recognized that on previous occasions when military action was taken on the basis of a reasonably arguable case , the degree of public and Parliamentary scrutiny of the legal issue was nothing like as great as it is today . \nThe analysis set out above applies whether a second resolution fails to be adopted because of a lack of votes or because it is vetoed . \nAs I have said before , I do not believe that there is any basis in law for arguing that there is an implied condition of reasonableness which can be read into the power of veto conferred on the permanent members of the Security Council by the UN Charter . \nSo there are no grounds for arguing that an `` unreasonable veto '' would entitle us to proceed on the basis of a presumed Security Council authorisation . \nIn any event , if the majority of world opinion remains opposed to military action , it is likely to be difficult on the facts to categorise a French veto as `` unreasonable '' . \nThe legal analysis may , however , be affected by the course of events over the next week or so , e.g. the discussions on the draft second resolution . \nIf we fail to achieve the adoption of a second resolution , we would need to consider urgently at that stage the strength of our legal case in the light of circumstances at that time . \nPossible consequences of acting without a second resolution 32 . \nIn assessing the risks of acting on the basis of a reasonably arguable case , you will wish to take account of the ways in which the matter might be brought before a court . \nThere are a number of possibilities . \nFirst , the General Assembly could request an advisory opinion on the legality of the military action from the International Court of Justice -LRB- ICJ -RRB- . \nA request for such an opinion could be made at the request of a simple majority of the States within the GA , so the UK and US could not block such action . \nSecond , given that the United Kingdom has accepted the compulsory jurisdiction of the ICJ , it is possible that another State which has also accepted the Court 's jurisdiction might seek to bring a case against us . \nThis , however , seems a less likely option since Iraq itself could not bring a case and it is not easy to see on what basis any other State could establish that it had a dispute with the UK . \nBut we can not absolutely rule out that some State strongly opposed to military action might try to bring such a case . \nIf it did , an application for interim measures to stop the campaign could be brought quite quickly -LRB- as it was in the case of Kosovo -RRB- . \nThe International Criminal Court at present has no jurisdiction over the crime of aggression and could therefore not entertain a case concerning the lawfulness of any military action . \nThe ICC will however have jurisdiction to examine whether any military campaign has been conducted in accordance with international humanitarian law . \nGiven the controversy surrounding the legal basis for action , it is likely that the Court will scrutinise any allegations of war crimes by UK forces very closely . \nThe Government has already been put on notice by CND that they intend to report to the ICC Prosecutor any incidents which their lawyers assess to have contravened the Geneva Conventions . \nThe ICC would only be able to exercise jurisdiction over UK personnel if it considered that the UK prosecuting authorities were unable or unwilling to investigate and , if appropriate , prosecute the suspects themselves . \nIt is also possible that CND may try to bring further action to stop military action in the domestic courts , but I am confident that the courts would decline jurisdiction as they did in the case brought by CND last November . \nTwo further , though probably more remote possibilities , are an attempted prosecution for murder on the grounds that the military action is unlawful and an attempted prosecution for the crime of aggression . \nAggression is a crime under customary international law which automatically forms part of domestic law . \nIt might therefore be argued that international aggression is a crime recognized by the common law which can be prosecuted in the UK courts . \nIn short , there are a number of ways in which the opponents of military action might seek to bring a legal case , internationally or domestically , against the UK , members of the Government or UK military personnel . \nSome of these seem fairly remote possibilities , but given the strength of opposition to military action against Iraq , it would not be surprising if some attempts were made to get a case of some sort off the ground . \nWe can not be certain that they would not succeed . \nThe GA route may be the most likely , but you are in a better position than me to judge whether there are likely to be enough States in the GA who would be willing to vote for such a course of action in present circumstances . \nFinally , I must stress that the lawfulness of military action depends not only on the existence of a legal basis , but also on the question of proportionality . \nAny force used pursuant to the authorisation in resolution 678 -LRB- whether or not there is a second resolution -RRB- : must have as its objective the enforcement the terms of the cease-fire contained in resolution 687 -LRB- 1990 -RRB- and subsequent relevant resolutions ; be limited to what is necessary to achieve that objective ; and must be a proportionate response to that objective , ie securing compliance with Iraq 's disarmament obligations . \nThat is not to say that action may not be taken to remove Saddam Hussein from power if it can be demonstrated that such action is a necessary and proportionate measure to secure the disarmament of Iraq . \nBut regime change can not be the objective of military action . \nThis should be borne in mind in considering the list of military targets and in making public statements about any campaign . \n"}
{"id": "222", "time": "2005-04-28", "text": "Full text : Iraq legal advice The full text of the advice about the legality of war with Iraq given by the attorney general , Lord Goldsmith , to the prime minister , Tony Blair , on March 7 2003 1 . \nYou have asked me for advice on the legality of military action against Iraq without a further resolution of the Security Council . \nThis is , of course , a matter we have discussed before . \nSince then , I have had the benefit of discussions with the Foreign Secretary and Sir Jeremy Greenstock -LRB- the then British ambassador to the UN -RRB- , who have given me valuable background information on the negotiating history of resolution 1441 . \nIn addition , I have also had the opportunity to hear the views of the US Administration from their perspective as co-sponsors of the resolution . \nThis note considers the issues in detail in order that you are in a position to understand the legal reasoning . \nMy conclusions are summarised at paragraphs 26 to 31 below . \nPossible legal bases for the use of force : 2 . \nAs I have previously advised , there are generally three possible bases for the use of force : -LRB- a -RRB- self-defence -LRB- which may include collective self-defence -RRB- ; -LRB- b -RRB- exceptionally , to avert overwhelming humanitarian catastrophe ; and -LRB- c -RRB- authorisation by the Security Council acting under Chapter VII of the UN Charter . \nForce may be used in self-defence if there is an actual or imminent threat of an armed attack ; the use of force must be necessary , ie the only means of averting an attack ; and the force used must be a proportionate response . \nIt is now widely accepted that an imminent armed attack will justify the use of force if the other conditions are met . \nThe concept of what is imminent may depend on the circumstances . \nDifferent considerations may apply , for example , where the risk is of attack from terrorists sponsored or harboured by a particular State , or where there is a threat of an attack by nuclear weapons . \nHowever , in my opinion there must be some degree of imminence . \nI am aware that the USA has been arguing for recognition of a broad doctrine of a right to use force to pre-empt danger in the future . \nIf this means more than a right to respond proportionately to an imminent attack -LRB- and I understand that the doctrine is intended to carry that connotation -RRB- this is not a doctrine which , in my opinion , exists or is recognized in international law . \nThe use of force to avert overwhelming humanitarian catastrophe has been emerging as a further , and exceptional , basis for the use of force . \nIt was relied on by the UK in the Kosovo crisis and is the underlying justification for the No-Fly Zones . \nThe doctrine remains controversial , however . \nI know of no reason why it would be an appropriate basis for action in present circumstances . \nForce may be used where this authorised -LRB- sic -RRB- by the UN Security Council acting under Chapter VII of the UN Charter . \nThe key question is whether resolution 1441 has the effect of providing such authorisation . \nAs you are aware , the argument that resolution 1441 itself provides the authorisation to use force depends on the revival of the express authorisation to use force given in 1990 by Security Council resolution 678 . \nThis in turn gives rise to two questions : -LRB- a -RRB- is the so-called `` revival argument '' a sound legal basis in principle ? \n-LRB- b -RRB- is resolution 1441 sufficient to revive the authorisation in resolution 678 ? \nI deal with these questions in turn . \nIt is a trite , but nonetheless relevant observation given what some commentators have been saying , that f the answer to these two questions is `` yes '' , the use of force will have been authorised by the United Nations and not in defiance of it . \nFollowing its invasion and annexation of Kuwait , the Security Council authorised the use of force against Iraq in resolution 678 -LRB- 1990 -RRB- . \nThis resolution authorised coalition forces to use all necessary means to force Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait and to restore international eace and security in the area . \nThe resolution gave a legal basis for Operation Desert Storm , which was brought to an end by the ceasefire set out by the Council in resolution 687 -LRB- 1991 -RRB- . \nThe conditions for the ceasefire in that resolution -LRB- and subsequent resolutions -RRB- imposed obligations on Iraq with regard to the elimination of WMD and monitoring of its obligations . \nResolution 687 suspended , but did not terminate , the authority to use force in resolution 678 . \nNor has any subsequent resolution terminated the authorisation to use force in resolution 678 . \nIt has been the UK 's view that a violation of Iraq 's obligations under resolution 687 which is sufficiently serious to undermine the basis of the ceasefire can revive the authorisation to use force in resolution 678 . \nIn reliance on this argument , force has been used on certain occasions . \nI am advised by the Foreign Office Legal Advisers that this was the basis for the use of force between 13 and 18 January 1993 following UN Presidential Statements on 8 and 11 January 1993 condemning particular failures by Iraq to observe the terms of the ceasefire resolution . \nThe revival argument was also the basis for the use of force in December 1998 by the US and UK -LRB- Operation Desert Fox -RRB- . \nThis followed a series of Security Council resolutions , notably resolution 1205 -LRB- 1998 -RRB- . \nLaw Officers have advised in the past that , provided the conditions are made out , the revival argument does provide a sufficient justification in international law for the use of force against Iraq . \nThat view is supported by an opinion given in August 1992 by the then UN Legal Counsel , Carl-August Fleischauer . \nHowever , the UK has consistently taken the view -LRB- as did the Fleischauer opinion -RRB- that , as the ceasefire conditions were set by the Security Council in resolution 687 , it is for the Council to assess whether any such breach of those obligations has occurred . \nThe US have a rather different view : they maintain that the fact of whether Iraq is in breach is a matter of objective fact which may therefore be assessed by individual Member States . \nI am not aware of any other state which supports this view . \nThis is an issue of critical importance when considering the effect of resolution 1441 . \nThe revival argument is controversial . \nIt is not widely accepted among academic commentators . \nHowever , I agree with my predecessors ' advice on this issue . \nFurther , I believe that the arguments in support of the revival argument are stronger following adoption of resolution 1441 . \nThat is because of the terms of the resolution and the course of the negotiations which led to its adoption . \nThus , preambular paragraphs 4 , 5 and 10 recall the authorisation to use force in resolution 678 and that resolution 687 imposed obligations on Iraq as a necessary condition of the ceasefire . \nOperative paragraph -LRB- OP -RRB- 1 provides that Iraq has been and remains in material breach of its obligations under relevant resolutions , including the resolution 687 . \nOP13 recalls that Iraq has been warned repeatedly that `` serious consequences '' will result from continued violations of its obligations . \nThe previous practice of the Council and statements made by Council members during the negotiation of resolution 1441 demonstrate that the phrase `` material breach '' signifies a finding by the Council of a sufficiently serious breach of the cease-fire conditions to revive the authorisation in resolution 678 and that `` serious consequences '' is accepted as indicating the use of force . \nI disagree , therefore , with those commentators and lawyers , who assert that nothing less than an explicit -LRB- underlined -RRB- authorisation to use force in a Security Council resolution will be sufficient . \nIn order for the authorisation to use force in resolution 678 to be revived , there needs to be a determination by the Security Council that there is a violation of the conditions of the ceasefire and that the Security Council considers it sufficiently serious to destroy the basis of the ceasefire . \nRevival will not , however , take place , notwithstanding a finding of violation , if the Security Council has made it clear either that action short of the use of force should be taken to ensure compliance with the terms of the cease-fire , or that it intends to decide subsequently what action is required to ensure compliance . \nNotwithstanding the determination of material breach in OP1 of resolution 1441 , it is clear that the Council did not intend that the authorisation in resolution 678 should revive immediately -LRB- underlined -RRB- following the adoption of resolution 1441 , since OP2 of the resolution affords Iraq a `` final opportunity '' to comply with its disarmament obligations under previous resolutions by co-operating with the enhanced inspection regime described in OPs 3 and 5-9 . \nBut OP2 also states that the Council has determined that compliance with resolution 1441 is Iraq 's last chance before the ceasefire resolution will be enforced . \nOP2 has the effect therefore of suspending the legal consequences of the OP1 determination of material breach which would otherwise have triggered the revival of the authorisation in resolution 678 . \nThe narrow but key question is : on the true interpretation of resolution 1441 , what has the Security Council decided will be the consequences of Iraq 's failure to comply with the enhanced regime . \nThe provisions relevant to determining whether or not Iraq has taken the final opportunity given by the Security Council are contained in OPs 4 , 11 and 12 of the resolution . \nOP4 provides that false statements or omissions in the declaration to be submitted by Iraq under OP3 and failure by Iraq at any time to comply with and cooperate fully in the implementation of resolution 1441 will constitute a further material breach of Iraq 's obligations and will be reported to the Council for assessment under paragraphs 11 and 12 of the resolution . \nOP11 directs the Executive Chairman of UNMOVIC and the Director-General of the IAEA to report immediately to the Council any interference by Iraq with inspection activities , as well as any failure by Iraq to comply with its disarmament obligations , including the obligations regarding inspections under resolution 1441 . \nOP12 provides that the Council will convene immediately on receipt of a report in accordance with paragraphs 4 or 11 `` in order to consider the situation and the need for compliance with all of the relevant Council resolutions in order to secure international peace and security '' . \nIt is clear from the text of the resolution , and is apparent from the negotiating history , that if Iraq fails to comply , there will be a further Security Council discussion . \nThe text is , however , ambiguous and unclear on what happens next . \nThere are two competing arguments : -LRB- i -RRB- that provided there is a Council discussion , if it does not reach a conclusion , there remains an authorisation to use force ; -LRB- ii -RRB- that nothing short of a further Council decision will be a legitimate basis for the use of force . \nThe first argument is based on the following steps -LRB- a -RRB- OP1 , by stating that Iraq `` has been and remains in material breach '' of its obligations under relevant resolutions , including resolution 687 amounts to a determination by the Council that Iraq 's violations of resolution 687 are sufficiently serious to destroy the basis of the ceasefire and therefore , in principle , to revive the authorisation to use force in resolution 678 ; -LRB- b -RRB- the Council decided , however , to give Iraq `` a final opportunity '' -LRB- OP2 -RRB- but because of the clear warning that it faced `` serious consequences as a result of its continued violations '' -LRB- OP 13 -RRB- was warning that a failure to take that `` final opportunity '' would lead to such consequences ; -LRB- c -RRB- further , by OP 4 , the Council decided in advance -LRB- underlined -RRB- that false statements or omissions in its declaration and `` failure by Iraq at any time -LRB- underlined -RRB- to comply with , and cooperate fully in the implementation of , this resolution '' would constitute `` a further material breach '' ; the argument is that the Council 's determination in advance -LRB- underlined -RRB- that particular conduct would constitute a material breach -LRB- thus reviving the authorisation to use force -RRB- is as good as its determination after -LRB- underlined -RRB- the event ; -LRB- d -RRB- in either event , the Council must meet -LRB- OP 12 -RRB- `` to consider the situation and the need for full compliance with all of the relevant Council resolutions in order to secure international peace and security '' , but the resolution singularly does not say that the Council must decide what action to take . \nThe Council knew full well , it is argued , the difference between `` consider '' and `` decide '' and so the omission is highly significant . \nIndeed , the omission is especially important as the French and Russians made proposals to include an express requirement for a further decision , but these were rejected precisely to avoid being tied to the need to obtain a second resolution . \nOn this view , therefore , while the Council has the opportunity to take a further decision , the determinations of material breach in OPs 1 and 4 remain valid even if the Council does not act . \nThe second argument focuses , by contrast , on two provisions in particular of the resolution : first , the final words in OP4 -LRB- `` and will be reported to the Council for assessment in accordance with paragraphs 11 and 12 below '' -RRB- and , second , the requirement in OP12 for the Council to `` consider the situation and the need for full compliance with all of the relevant Council resolutions in order to secure international peace and security '' . \nTaken together , it is argued , these provisions indicate that the Council decided in resolution 1441 that in the event of continued Iraqi non-compliance , the issue should return to the Council for a further decision on what action should be taken at that stage . \nSo far as OP4 of the resolution is concerned , one view is that the words at the end of this paragraph indicate the need for an assessment by the Security Council of how serious any Iraqi breaches really are and whether they are sufficiently serious to destroy the basis of the ceasefire . \nThis argument is supported by public statements to the effect that only serious cases of non-compliance will constitute a further material breach . \nThus , the Foreign Secretary stated in Parliament on 25 November that `` material breach means something significant ; some behavior or pattern of behavior that is serious . \nAmong such breaches could be action by the Government of Iraq seriously to obstruct or impede the inspectors , to intimidate witnesses , or a pattern of behavior where any single action appears relatively minor but the action as a whole add up to something deliberate and more significant : something that shows Iraq 's intention not to comply '' . \nIf that is right , then the question is who makes the assessment of what constitutes a sufficiently serious breach . \nOn the UK view of the revival argument -LRB- though not the US view -RRB- that can only be the Council , because only the Council can decide if a violation is sufficiently serious to revive the authorisation to use force . \nIt is right to say , however , that such an argument has less force if OP4 operates automatically . \nThus , the wording of OP4 indicates that any failure by Iraq to comply with and cooperate fully in the implementation of the resolution will constitute a further material breach -LRB- leaving aside the question of whether false statements or omissions in the OP3 declaration is an additional requirement -RRB- . \nIf OP4 means what it says : the words `` cooperate fully '' were included specifically to ensure that any instances of non-cooperation would amount to a further material breach . \nThis is the US analysis of OP4 and is undoubtedly more consistent with the view that no further decision of the Council is necessary to authorise force , because it can be argued that the Council has determined in advance that any failure will be a material breach . \nIt has been suggested that it is possible to establish that Iraq has failed to take its final opportunity through the procedures in OPs 11 and 12 without regard to OP4 , in which case it is unnecessary to consider the effect of the words `` for assessment '' . \nI do not consider that this argument really assists . \nFirst , the resolution must be read as a whole . \nSecond , I accept that it is possible that a Council discussion under OP12 may be triggered by a report from Blix and El-Baradei under OP11 and that this may have the effect of establishing that Iraq has failed to take the final opportunity granted by OP2 . \nBut I do not consider that it can be argued seriously that OP4 does not apply in these circumstances . \nIt is clear from a comparison of the wording of paragraphs 4 and 11 that any Iraqi conduct which would be sufficient to trigger a report from the inspectors under OP11 would also amount to a failure to comply with and cooperate fully in the implementation of the resolution and would thus also be covered by OP4 . \nIn addition , the reference to paragraph 11 in OP4 can not be ignored . \nIt is not entirely clear what this means , but the most convincing explanation seems to be that it is a recognition that an OP11 inspectors ' report would also constitute a report of further material breach within the meaning of OP4 and would thus be assessed by the Council under OP12 . \nMoreover , the US see OP4 as an essential part of the mechanism for establishing that Iraq has failed to take its final opportunity . \nRead the second part of the advice . \n"}
{"id": "156", "time": "2005-04-28", "text": "Tony Blair at a Labor poster launch this morning . \nPhotograph : Bruno Vincent\\/Getty The full 13 pages of the attorney general 's formerly confidential advice on the legality of the Iraq war were today published as the prime minister , Tony Blair , battled accusations that he misled parliament and the cabinet over its contents . \nThe long-lobbied-for disclosure follows the publication on Guardian Unlimited yesterday evening of a two-page summary of the advice . \nThe government has previously resisted all attempts to secure its release . \nLord Goldsmith 's confidential minute of March 7 said he could make a `` reasonable case '' for Britain to go to war with Iraq without a second UN resolution but a court `` might well conclude '' this course of action was illegal under international law . \nFurther paragraphs released today also reveal Lord Goldsmith advised Mr Blair that in those circumstances he could not guarantee legal action would not be brought against members of the armed forces or government . \nMr Blair , speaking at the launch of Labor 's business manifesto , said his preference had been for a second resolution but when it was clear France would use its security council veto to block any ultimatum that was no longer an option . \n`` The purpose of the advice was to make it clear we could proceed by law , '' the prime minister said . \n`` The attorney general 's advice was necessary to say the war could proceed lawfully . '' \nLord Goldsmith 's full advice ruled out self-defence and humanitarian motives for war . \nIt instead examined and gave support to the argument that resolution 1441 of November 2002 had revived the authority of UN security council Resolution 678 in 1990 to go to war with Saddam Hussein if he had not stuck to the 1991 ceasefire . \n`` Once he advised that , the question for everybody was political , '' Mr Blair said today . \n`` Did we think we should proceed , notwithstanding the fact we could not get a second UN resolution ? \n`` And I took the view then , I take it now , that it was better for this country 's security , and the security of the world , to remove Saddam and put him in prison rather than have him in power . '' \nThe legal advice , however , said that the lawfulness of military action depended on the question of what was proportionate to disarm Iraq . \n`` Regime change can not be the objective of military action , '' Lord Goldsmith wrote . \nMr Blair was backed up on stage by the chancellor , Gordon Brown , and the trade secretary , Patricia Hewitt , as he faced questioning over whether the cabinet was aware of the full extent of the attorney general 's advice . \nMr Brown said the cabinet had `` full discussions on numerous occasions '' and saw a lengthy document on the legal issues involved before it backed the invasion . \nMr Blair said he `` took '' the cabinet through the legal issues and Ms Hewitt said Lord Goldsmith had been present at the cabinet discussions . \nLord Goldsmith 's full advice had concluded that the government would need `` hard evidence '' that Iraq was not cooperating with UN weapon inspectors if it was to argue it could go to war on the basis of past UN resolutions . \nThe 13-page minute was sent to Mr Blair on the same day that the chief UN weapons inspector , Hans Blix , declared that Iraq had made `` substantial '' progress in destroying its long-range missiles , and he found no evidence of biological or chemical weapons . \nIt appears at odds with the parliamentary answer issued by Lord Goldsmith 10 days later that concluded it was `` plain '' that Iraq was in breach of its UN disarmament obligations . \nMr Blair said evidence released by the foreign secretary , Jack Straw , on March 15 2003 had shown that Saddam was in clear breach of his UN disarmament obligations . \n`` This so-called smoking gun has turned out to be a damp squib , '' he said . \nMr Brown , meanwhile , paid tribute to the prime minister 's handling of the pre-war diplomacy . \n`` I not only trust Tony Blair but I respect Tony Blair for the way he went about that decision , '' he said . \nEarlier , the Conservative leader , Michael Howard , demanded that Mr Blair explain why Lord Goldsmith changed his legal advice and why the prime minister has repeatedly maintained that it did not change . \n`` Last night we received devastating new information which exposed that when Mr Blair said ' I have never lied ' , he was not telling the truth , '' he said . \n`` We 've been told by Mr Blair that on March 17 - just 10 days later - the advice given by the attorney general to cabinet was clear and it had n't changed . \nWe now know beyond any doubt that it had changed . '' \nThe Liberal Democrat leader , Charles Kennedy , stoutly resisted calls for him to accuse Mr Blair of being a liar but echoed Mr Howard 's call for answers , saying that the prime minister must `` come clean with the British public '' over the legality of the Iraq war . \n"}
{"id": "161", "time": "2005-04-21", "text": "Full text : Blair 's Newsnight interview The prime minister talked about tax , immigration and his own future with the BBC 's Jeremy Paxman . \nBut first , as ever , came the war Thursday 21 April 2005 17.48 BST Paxman : Hello , welcome to the second of three interviews with the leaders of the three big parties , who want our votes on May 5 . \nOn Friday , it 's Michael Howard ; this evening I 'm in Leeds with the prime minister , Tony Blair . \nPrime Minister , is there anything you would like to apologise for ? \nBlair : Well , if you want me apologise for the war in Iraq , I 'm afraid I ca n't say sorry we removed Saddam . \nNo , if you 're asking me other things I 've got wrong over the past eight years , I 've already said there are certain things that any government gets wrong . \nI suppose I 've had my share of those . \nPaxman : But do you accept that there is a trust issue , and that the reason opposition parties can talk about wiping the smirk off your face is because you ca n't any longer say : ` Look at me . \nI 'm a pretty straight kind of guy ' ? \nBlair : Well , trust is an issue . \nBut then people are going to have decide , you know : are we to be trusted when we say we 've run a strong economy and we 'll continue to do so with low interest rates and low unemployment and low inflation ? \nI said that we would put investment into the public services ; we have . \nYou go and look at any school or hospital ; you look at this city here and how it 's been transformed in the past few years . \nLook at the investment in the local regeneration of an inner city such as Leeds . \nNow , if you 're talking about Iraq , yes , there 's an issue because people , some people , feel they were misled over the war and some people powerfully disagree with the reason why we went to war . \nPaxman : All right , let 's look at Iraq . \nWhen you told parliament that the intelligence was `` extensive , detailed and authoritative '' , that was n't true , was it ? \nBlair : No , it was true . \nThere was no doubt about ... Paxman : It was n't extensive , it was n't detailed and it was n't authoritative . \nBlair : I 'm sorry : it was . \nAnd the great thing about this now for any member of the public is that thanks to the Butler report - and remember , we 've had four separate inquiries into whether this intelligence was misused or not - each of them have come to the same conclusion , and people can actually go and look on the website and they can go and study the Joint Intelligence Committee reports that I got . \nBlair : And see the intelligence that was given to us . \nPaxman : OK , but you know , do n't you , that just two weeks before you made that statement the Joint Intelligence Committee said that ` intelligence remains limited '' . \nBlair : Of course , intelligence always is limited , but ... Paxman : Well , therefore it 's not extensive , detailed and authoritative , is it ? \nBlair : No , it ... I 'm sorry , their judgment was absolutely clear . \nLook , the one , the one thing you can do is go and read it . \nIt said that Saddam Hussein ... Blair : -LRB- It said he -RRB- had chemical and biological weapons ; that he could manufacture new stocks of VX and sarin agent within months of doing so . \nThat he could use those weapons against not just military targets but strategic targets . \nYou can go and read it . \nPaxman : They said it was limited ; you said it was ` extensive , detailed and authoritative ' . \nBlair : They also made it clear that there was extensive intelligence about Saddam . \nThey said , however , of course it 's necessarily limited : intelligence always is . \nPaxman : So was the JIC , the Joint Intelligence Committee , report wrong ? \nBlair : No , they were n't wrong in what they reported at the time ; they were absolutely right . \nBut later it transpired that ... Blair : Some , not all , of that intelligence was wrong . \nBut the decision I had to take at the time was whether as a result of that intelligence we could conclude Saddam was in breach of United Nations resolutions , and I concluded he was . \nAnd I may say the evidence is that he indeed was in breach of UN resolutions . \nPaxman : Well , so when you wrote in the forward to the dossier that the threat from Saddam was ` serious and current ' , it was n't . \nAnd indeed your own chief of staff , Jonathan Powell , had said the dossier did nothing to demonstrate a threat . \nBlair : No , I 'm sorry . \nThe evidence that we presented was absolutely clearly set out in the Joint Intelligence Committee reports . \nYou 've had four inquires in to this . \nWe subjected ourselves as a government , me as a prime minister , to a more extensive inquiry than any government has ever given , and what I 'd simply ask people to do , instead of continually attacking my integrity over Iraq ... I 've never disrespected people who have taken a different point of view . \nBut I had to take a decision in the best interests of the country ; I took that decision . \nI can not , I 'm afraid , apologise for having taken it . \nI believe still it was the right thing to do . \nI understand the fact ... Paxman : Despite the fact there were no weapons of mass destruction Blair : That disagree with ... Yes , because ... Paxman : And you told us there were . \nBlair : The legal case was the breach of United Nations resolutions . \nThe evidence from the Iraq survey group is that he was indeed in breach of UN resolutions , and incidentally it was n't just us in Britain that concluded he had WMD : the entire United Nations concluded that , which is why they passed resolution 14.41 . \nPaxman : Did you see the Foreign Office legal advice which said military action against Iraq would be ` illegal without a further UN resolution ' ? \nBLAIR : No , I had the attorney general 's advice to guide me . \nBut again this thing has been built in to , you know , a Paxman : You did n't see that Foreign Office advice saying that an invasion would be illegal without a second UN resolution ? \nBlair : No , because I had the attorney general 's advice . \nPaxman : You did n't see it ? \nBlair : Yes , I did n't see it . \nBut I had the attorney general 's advice , and the attorney general made it absolutely clear that provided we could show that there were breaches of the United Nations resolutions ... Paxman : The attorney general is a political appointment , Prime Minister . \nShould n't you have seen the Foreign Office legal advice ? \nBLAIR : But the attorney general 's advice is the advice he gives us as the law officer . \nHe acts in an independent way in doing that . \nPaxman : Do you accept any responsibility at all for the death of Dr David Kelly . \nBlair : It was a terrible , terrible thing to have happened . \nI do n't believe we had any option , however , but to disclose his name because I think had we failed to do so , that would have been seen as attempting to conceal something from the committee that was looking into this at the time . \nAnd again ... Paxman : Do you accept any responsibility at all ? \nBlair : In relation to this . \nBlair : No , I 've said what I 've said , and I feel desperately sorry for his family and indeed for the terrible ordeal that they were put through . \nBut as I said at the time - and again , this has been gone into time and time again - if we had concealed the fact , because this whole row was about the information that - as you know , we 've been over this many , many times - had been given to the BBC reporter , he had then come forward and said to his superiors : `` This is me . \nI think it 's me who 's responsible for having given this story '' ... There was a Foreign affairs select committee report going at the time . \nI think if we 'd concealed that from people , we would have been subject to a different type of allocation . \nPaxman : So the short answer to the question is , you do n't accept any responsibility . \nBlair : Well , it 's not a question of not accepting responsibility ; it is a question of simply explaining the circumstances . \nPaxman : It 's a question to which you could give a yes or no answer , Prime Minister . \nBlair : Yeah , but it 's maybe not a question you need to give a yes or no answer to . \nPaxman : All right . \nYou keep referring to these inquiries . \nThe inquiry that you set up under Lord Butler concluded that what went wrong there was partly the consequence of your style of government , so-called sofa government . \nWill your next government , if you have one , be any different ? \nBlair : I do n't run a sofa style of government . \nThere were over 20 cabinet discussions of the Iraq war . \nPaxman : Lord Butler said : `` We are concerned that the informality and circumscribed character of the government 's procedures , which we saw in the context of policymaking towards Iraq , risks reducing the scope for informed , collective , political judgment . '' \nAre we going to see a different style of government in future , if you are in government ? \nBlair : We have a government that involves people fully . \nI 'm sorry , I do n't accept that we did not discuss Iraq in a proper way : we did . \nPaxman : How many times did the ministerial defense and overseas policy committee meet in the run-up to war ? \nBlair : It did n't have to meet the whole ... Paxman : It did n't meet at all , did it . \nBlair : Well , hang on . \nIt did n't have to meet , Jeremy , because we had an ad hoc committee of ministers that were meeting virtually daily at points . \nPaxman : And that is precisely what Lord Butler criticised . \nBlair : No , he does n't criticise that , actually ; that 's completely different from the so-called sofa style of government . \nLook , I want to make this point to you because you can go on , over and over and over , about these events that have happened . \nIn the end , I had a decision to make back in March 2003 . \nWe had 250,000 UK and US troops there ; we had Saddam not in compliance with UN resolutions . \nI tried desperately hard to get a second UN resolution . \nI could n't get one . \nNow I had a decision to make as to whether to leave Saddam there , in breach of UN resolutions , and end up in a situation with the international community humiliated and him emboldened , or to remove him . \nI decided to remove him . \nNow , you can go through these issues about my integrity , my character , the legal advice - because the legal advice , actually , the legal issue , was exactly the same as the political issue - or you can accept that in the end a decision had to be taken ; there was no middle way , there was no fence to sit on . \nI took that decision . \nNow , I know people strongly disagreed with it . \nIn the end , I had to take the decision as prime minister that I thought was right for the country , and I did so . \nPaxman : The problem is , Prime Minister , that the next time the Joint Intelligence Committee come to you and say , `` We have extensive , authoritative intelligence of a threat or possible threat to this country . \nWe urge pre-emptive action , '' you wo n't be able to sell it to the public . \nBlair : Well , let 's wait and see if that ever happens - and I hope it never does . \nBut I think that people , actually , when they look at this , despite all the stuff , because continually this argument is conducted ... Paxman : Why should they believe you again ? \nBlair : Because in the end , people have got to make a judgment about this . \nThis was not an easy decision to take ; it was a hard decision . \nBlair : I took the decision I thought was right , and if I had not taken that decision , then what ? \nYou 'd have Saddam Hussein and his sons still running Iraq ; you would n't have 8 million Iraqis going out voting at the polls ; you would n't have change spreading across the Middle East as it is . \nThere has been a lot that has happened on the other side of the argument that , just occasionally , we should also pay attention to . \nPaxman : Although those , of course , are not the grounds on which you told us we should go to war at the time . \nBlair : The grounds were , the legal case was , breaches of UN resolutions . \nHe was in breach of UN resolutions . \nBut again , if I may say , this again has been completely rewritten afterwards . \nBlair : I spoke about the regime and the nature of regime continually , because what I said to people was : `` This is a difficult situation but let us , if we have to remove them , remove them with a clear conscience , because this is a man responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths . '' \nPaxman : This matters also , Prime Minister , because during your time in office you have committed British forces to battle on five separate occasions . \nOn past form , we can expect if you 're returned to Downing Street they might be committed another couple of times in another Blair government . \nYou have n't given George Bush any undertakings about anywhere else in the world , have you ? \nBlair : I have n't given him any undertakings about anywhere and I do n't make the decision according to what the president of the United States might want . \nI make it according to what I think are in the interests of this country , and if you look at the military action we 've taken in respect of Kosovo , right , well , we could have opted out of that , too , but look what happened in the early 1990s , when hundreds of thousands of people died in the Balkans . \nWe took military action in Afghanistan . \nLook at the democratic election that 's happening there . \nWe took the action in Iraq , and I explained that already . \nWe took the action in Sierra Leone , where we saved a country ' democracy from a gang of murderous gangsters , you know , and I going to do ... No , I 'm sorry . \nI think we can be proud of what the magnificent British armed forces have done , and those decisions , some of them , particularly Iraq , were very difficult . \nPaxman : While we 're on defense , Prime Minister , the British independent nuclear deterrent is going to need replacing , probably a decision that has to be taken in the next government that takes office after May 5 . \nWill you replace it . \nBlair : Well , we 've got to retain our nuclear deterrent , and we 've had an independent nuclear deterrent for a long time . \nNow that decision is for another time , but in principle I believe it 's important to retain our own independent deterrent . \nPaxman : A continuing independent nuclear deterrent . \nBlair : I believe that is the right thing for the country . \nI think it 's important that however we look at all the different aspects of it ... And a decision has n't yet been taken . \nPaxman : And the billions of pounds that are involved , you 're prepared to make available ? \nBlair : Well , we have to see . \nCost is one aspect to it . \nBut I think it 's important this country retains a strong defense at all times . \nPaxman : Would cost convince you not to go ahead with it ? \nBlair : You just ... Look , there 's no point in speculating about that at the moment because we 're a long way off taking the decision . \nPaxman : Just while we 're on foreign affairs : there 's a new Pope appointed . \nDo you agree that ... Blair : Now , that 's one election I ca n't comment on , I 'm afraid . \nPaxman : Do you agree that condoms prevent the spread of Aids ? \nBlair : Yes , I do . \nPaxman : Would you be prepared to tell the Pope that ? \nBlair : Jeremy , I mean , you know , I 've ... I do n't know . \nIf I ever have this conversation with him , I 'm sure we will talk about how we can do lots of things to help the world , but I do n't want to ... I 've got enough issues in my own election without getting into his . \nPaxman : Let 's look at tax . \nBefore the last election , you made exactly the same promise you 're making this time : no increase in the basic rate of tax ; no increase the higher rate of tax ; no commitment at all on national insurance . \nYou spoke to us , very kindly , before that election , and I suggested to you that any reasonable person would therefore conclude that after the election , you would raise the basic rate of national insurance . \nYou said that we should n't make such an assumption , and then you did it . \nYou 're not expecting us to fall for that a second time are you ? \nBlair : Well , it was n't a question of falling for it the first time . \nThe fact is ... Paxman : Well , we did . \nWe took you at your word . \nHang on a minute . \nI was asked the question , is there a reason why , in the government 's proposal you should raise national insurance ? \nI said you should n't make any assumption about that at all . \nPaxman : Would n't any reasonable person suppose that you therefore propose to increase national insurance contributions ? \nBlair : For exactly the reason I 've just given . \nBlair : Yeah , but you were saying to me , as I recall it : `` Look , your spending proposals mean you 're going to have to put up taxes . '' \nNow the reason why we ended up putting 1 % on national insurance was because subsequent to the election we got a report on the National Health Service that said you 're going to have to raise spending by more than you had thought in order to make sure that you get a proper and full financing of the National Health Service . \nSo the actual commitments ... Paxman : But Prime Minister , you had committed before the election to raise the National Health spending to the European average . \nYou made that commitment before the election . \nAnd in the manifesto what we said was that the commitments we had could be financed by the taxes that had been set aside . \nWhat happened after the election was , we got a report that said : no , actually , if you want to reach the European Union average , the figures are n't as you supposed they are . \nYou 're going to have to raise it further in order to do that . \nAnd that 's why we did it , and that 's why we 've got the 1 % national insurance . \nNow that was a catch-up in the health service , but you know , it was necessary . \nPaxman : There could be any old report coming along after this election which will necessitate you raising taxes again . \nBlair : I think the health service is a special case . \nBut look , in the end people again are going to have to make a judgment about it . \nI ca n't , I ca n't sit here and write the budget for every year of a Labor government . \nWhat I can say to people is , overall , our taxes are actually lower than the European average , and they 're lower as a proportion of our national income than most of the years that Margaret Thatcher was in power . \nPaxman : You are going to have to raise taxes after the election , are n't you ? \nBlair : No , you ca n't say that on the basis of the spending plans we have . \nPaxman : Well , you ca n't give us a commitment ; you wo n't . \nBlair : Well ... if you remember , we had precisely the same discussion before , and not just in relation to national insurance but other taxes , too . \nAnd what I said to you then , and I say it to you now , is the spending proposals that we have are adequately catered for by the tax plans that we 've got . \nPaxman : And there is no question , on your watch , of a local income tax ever being introduced . \nI mean , well ... We have a review into the council tax and what 's the right way to replace it , so you ca n't as it were foreclose options but for , for me the local income tax has always been a problem because it 's all very well for the Lib Dems to say , get rid of the council tax , and everyone says , well , that 's fantastic . \nBut if you 're a two-earner or three-earner household , you 're going to pay a lot more money under local income tax . \nPaxman : So no local income tax on your watch . \nBlair : Well , as I say , we 've got a review , so I 'm not going to , I ca n't start closing everything off , but what I can say to you is , personally , and I think I 've said this on many occasions , I think there are big problems of local income tax . \nPaxman : You 've promised assistance to those people at the Rover works who will lose their jobs . \nWhat is the moral difference between those people losing their jobs and the tens of thousands of civil servants you propose should lose their jobs ? \nBlair : Well , one is happening as an immediate redundancy . \nI mean , they 've actually been handed their redundancy notices . \nThe other will happen over time . \nPaxman : They 've still got mortgages to pay . \nWhich is why it 's being structured over a period of time , so that we can help people , retrain and get other jobs , and the one thing we 've done as a government , I think quite successfully , is , wherever there are large-scale job losses ... But Rover is different : you 've got 6,000 jobs going immediately , jobs in the supply chain going immediately . \nYou should go there and try and support them and give some support to the infrastructure . \nPaxman : And what was it in your analysis of what was wrong with Britain that convinced you that what this country needed was 40 super casinos ? \nBLAIR : Well , the question is : how do you prevent that happening ? \nIt 's not a question of , do you think it 's what the country needs . \nIs n't it sensible to have an overhaul of the gambling laws ? \nPaxman : Despite , you know , the social damage that is caused by addictive gambling ? \nBlair : Yeah , but that 's not the question . \nWe actually are setting up for the first time a gambling commission that will look into these issues and make recommendations . \nPeople think you can go down the street now and gamble . \nYou can gamble your mortgage away on putting money on a horse or , you know , take a bet on the election . \nThe point is , this type of larger casino , which is a big leisure complex , properly run , is it a disaster for the country ? \nI do n't think so . \nI think that if you look at the evidence of where these large-scale casinos have been introduced , it does n't bear out the opponents ' case at all , and I might just point out to you that until , certainly the newspapers started running a campaign on this , virtually everyone was in favor of these proposals . \nPaxman : Can you tell us how many failed asylum seekers there are in this country ? \nBlair : No , I ca n't be sure of the numbers of people who are illegals in this country . \nFor the same reason that the previous government could n't . \nWhat I can say is that the asylum system has been toughened up and tightened up hugely , and according to the United Nations commission for refugees and not us , asylum figures have fallen by more than a half in the past two or three years . \nPaxman : Can you give us a rough idea of how many there may be ? \nIs it tens of thousands ? \nBlair : I 've said I do n't think there 's any point in speculating . \nPaxman : But you have no idea . \nBlair : Well , it 's not a question of having no idea . \nPaxman : Well , what is your idea , Prime Minister ? \nBlair : What you can say is , how people are applying for asylum , month by month , how many people you are removing and what is the backlog , and we are dealing with all of those issues . \nPaxman : Prime Minister , you have really no idea of how many failed asylum seekers there are illegally in this country ? \nBlair : It is difficult , for the very reason that ... Blair : Hang on . \nFor the very reason that the previous government gave , you can not determine specifically how many people are here illegally . \nPaxman : You have no idea . \nBlair : What you can say is , here are the number of people that are actually currently applying for asylum . \nBlair : This is the backlog of claims that you 're dealing with . \nAnd these are the people who are being removed from the country . \nPaxman : Do people not come to you and say : we think , Prime Minister , there may be 100,000 or 250,000 , or 500,000 ... Blair : They do n't come and say that . \nPaxman : So you have no idea . \nBlair : No , hang on a minute . \nYou have an idea of the numbers that are claiming , the backlog , and the numbers that are being removed . \nSome of those asylum seekers , when they fail and their claim fails , they will go back voluntarily . \nPaxman : What 's your working assumption ? \nBlair : I do n't make a working assumption about it . \nWhat I do is I concentrate on the bits that are absolutely vital to concentrate on , which is - hang on , just let me finish - which is the numbers who are coming in , the numbers we 're removing and the backlog . \nThe only long-term way of dealing with this issue , however , is to introduce the proper controls of borders through an electronic visa regime . \nAnd the other thing is identity cards . \nPaxman : Does the fact that you 're unable or unwilling to tell us indicate that you have in fact lost control of our borders ? \nBlair : No , it does n't indicate that , beause no government has ever been able to say that . \nWhat you are able to say however is , here are the measures that we 're taking to control it properly , to deal with the abuses , and you are also able to say , which I can say to you very clearly because we keep the proper statistics of this , is the numbers that are claiming now and the numbers that we 're removing , and the way to get asylum figures down so that it 's only genuine refugees you 're taking ; to do precisely what we 've done : clean up the system , remove the tiers of appeal , make sure that people ca n't destroy their documentation when they come here and improve the removal system . \nWe 're doing all of those things . \nPaxman : And just one final time , you have no figure that you can give us for the number of refused asylum seekers who are in this country . \nBlair : I 'm giving you the information that I 've got , and I 've answered that question . \nPaxman : You ca n't give us any kind of figure . \nBlair : The reason is because some people will return after their asylum claim has failed . \nSo you have no idea . \nBlair : Well , what you have is an idea of the numbers that are coming in and claiming and the numbers that you 're removing . \nNow , those are the two important things to concentrate on . \nPaxman : Well , what is that number ? \nBlair : The number coming in now , it 's fallen to just over about 2,000 a month who are claiming asylum , and that 's down from , at its height , around 8,000 a month . \nAnd actually , that is lower than the figure in March 1997 . \nPaxman : But it gives us no indication of the backlog , of course . \nBlair : Well , no , sorry , it does give me an indication . \nBlair : No , no , no , Jeremy . \nYou can say what the backlog is of claims . \nThe backlog of claims , I think , is down to round about 10,000 . \nThat 's down from 60,000 that we inherited . \nIn respect of removals , there were one in five asylum seekers who failed , were being removed . \nIt 's now half of them that are being removed . \nAnd the answer that I have given to you on the numbers of illegals here is precisely the answer we have always given , and the last government gave . \nPaxman : Although you 've not given us a number . \nBlair : Well , I 've just explained to you why it 's impossible to do that . \nBut what you can do is give numbers for the other things . \nPaxman : Let 's look at economic migrants . \nIs there an upper limit to the number of economic migrants who should be allowed into this country ? \nBlair : Well , there 's an arbitrary limit or a quota , in my view , but there 's going to be a limit set by what your economy needs . \nPaxman : What does our economy need ? \nBlair : And the points system that we 're introducing will make sure that only people get work permits who actually come in and we need for our economy . \nPaxman : What does our economy need ? \nBlair : Well , at the moment , I think ... Well , I have n't got the exact figure off the top of my head , but I think it 's about 130,000 come in with work permits , but most of those people will come in , work for a time and go again . \nPaxman : Your previous home secretary , David Blunkett , told us that he saw no obvious upper limit . \nBlair : No , what he 's saying is exactly the same as me . \nThe Tories say you set a quota . \nSupposing you get a major company that says - I mean , here we are , a company of law offices here which is actually connected with an American company - supposing they need someone to come in from abroad for a short time . \nWhy should n't you have them in ? \nThe point is to make sure that you have strict controls that mean the only people your economy needs to come into this country come into this country . \nPaxman : But you have predictions of the economic growth of this country . \nYou know roughly what 's going to happen with the labor market . \nWhy are you so shy of just putting a rough figure on it ? \nBlair : Well , you can take the figures now . \nI do n't think the figures on work permits have changed that much in the past few years . \nBut the reason I should n't put a figure on it , is that I do n't run every business in the country . \nSupposing you get a business in the City of London that says , actually , we need 50 people in this specialty to come in and work here for six months . \nYou 'll do tremendous damage to your economy if you start taking out all migrant labor . \nOr for , even more absurdly , parliament to come along and say we , parliament , suddenly know what the needs of employers are in the country , it makes no sense to do that . \nPaxman : Prime Minister , if you are returned to Downing Street on May 6 , can you at least give us a guarantee that within , say , 12 months of your handing in your cards as prime minister , there would be a general election ? \nBlair : Well , I 've said I 'll service a full term , and you know ... Again , I mean , I 've been over this . \nPaxman : But people are entitled to know what they 're voting for , are n't they ? \nBlair : Yeah , absolutely . \nThat 's why I 've said ... Paxman : Or what they 're going to get . \nBlair : I 'll serve the full term . \nAnd they 'll get New Labor . \nPaxman : So that means , by the time there 's a new American President coming on his first visit to Britain in 2009 , you will still be in Downing Street . \nBlair : Well , people elect me , but I have n't won the election yet . \nPaxman : But if you 're elected , you will still be in Downing Street ? \nBlair : I 've said I 'll serve the full term , and exactly what situation happens then and how you hand over , well you can leave that to a later time . \nBut it 's not unknown , you know , for there are countries with fixed-term parliaments . \nPaxman : Oh , absolutely . \nBlair : There are other prime ministers who 've said : `` Look , this is my ... I 'll serve this term but I wo n't serve another term . '' \nI mean , I think the public actually has a very clear and sensible view of this . \nPaxman : Have you told Gordon Brown when you 're going to stand down ? \nBlair : No , I 've said to Gordon the same as I 've said to everyone : if you elect the prime minister , you serve the term . \nPaxman : So if there is any deal between the two of you , it 's a deal just in Gordon Brown 's mind . \nBlair : You do n't do deals about jobs like this . \nAnd Gordon and I have actually been working extremely closely together . \nIt 's been a great partnership . \nI hope it 's also been a good partnership for the country . \nI mean , we 've known each other for 20 years , and he 's been a magnificent chancellor . \nHe 's produced tremendous economic strength in this country , and you know , we can be proud , I hope , of what we 've achieved for the country . \nPaxman : So this deal is just in his mind . \nBlair : Well , I think you going on about what is in his mind ... As far as I 'm aware , as I think he was saying this morning , as we sat on the sofa together , , you know , we were there together to serve as prime minister and chancellor . \nPaxman : When you look at your time in Downing Street , when you came in 1997 , you were a young man . \nYou were talking about the ... Blair : You 're not going to show the old pictures , are you ? \nNone of us can really survive that . \nPaxman : But you came in , a young prime minister talking about a young country . \nNow they talk about how you 've got a fake tan . \nYou have n't got a fake tan , I take it . \nBlair : I have n't got a fake tan . \nAs a matter of fact , you look as if you 've been sitting out in the sun as well . \nPaxman : Well , actually , I have n't , no. . \nI know that 's your story . \nYou ca n't make that claim any more that you 're a young man in a young country . \nIs n't there a point where you think : God , it 's going to be great to be shot of all of this ? \nBlair : Well , not at the moment because I still think we 've got things to do . \nI 'm not saying the irony of this job is that you 're less popular as you go on , but in some ways you 're better equipped to do the job . \nAnd I feel that we 're just really poised on the health service , education reform , a lot of the stuff we 're doing on law and order . \nI think with the economy there 's a whole new series of things we 've got to do about science , technology , apprenticeship , vocational skills and , you know , there 's masses for me to do . \nAnd that 's what gets you up in the morning : it 's recognizing that whatever ghastly stuff is appearing from time to time in the media , you 've still got the energy and the determination to do the job . \nAnd then I 've a limit on my time doing it and then it 's for somebody else to take on the baton and run with it . \nBut I still feel there 's things we 've got to do , and I think we can accelerate the change , drive it faster in this third term . \nBut we 've got to get elected first . \nPaxman : Tony Blair , thank you . \n"}
{"id": "189", "time": "2005-04-26", "text": "Brian Sedgemore -LRB- r -RRB- with Charles Kennedy this morning . \nPhotograph : Gareth Fuller\\/PA Brian Sedgemore , a Labor MP for 27 years , has defected to the Liberal Democrats and urged voters to give Tony Blair a `` bloody nose '' at the general election next week . \nMr Sedgemore , who is standing down from parliament and not contesting his Hackney South and Shoreditch seat , said he was leaving Labor after becoming increasingly disillusioned with the government over the Iraq war and `` authoritarian '' anti-terrorism legislation . \nHe accused the prime minister of telling `` stomach-turning lies '' over Iraq and using the `` politics of fear to drive through parliament a deeply authoritarian set of law and order measures '' . \nMaking his first appearance as a Lib Dem this morning , he said : `` It is against this background I decided I could no longer support the Labor party and would join the Liberal Democrats . '' \n`` I urge everyone from the center and the left of British politics to give Tony Blair a bloody nose in the general election . '' \nThe Liberal Democrat leader , Charles Kennedy , sought to use Mr Sedgemore 's defection as evidence that voting for his party would not be a `` wasted '' vote , resulting merely in the election of a Tory government . \n`` The Conservatives self-evidently can not win this general election , '' he said . \n`` People who want to vote against Tony Blair for a variety of reasons can and should vote Liberal Democrat in that knowledge . \n`` Let us have no more ridiculous scare stories from Labor 's high command that voting for the Liberal Democrats will let the Conservatives in . '' \nMr Kennedy was reacting to Mr Blair 's repeated claim - made again in an interview in the Guardian today - that people who plan to vote Liberal Democrat risk waking up to a Tory government on May 6 . \nThe Liberal Democrats have published a series of newspaper adverts today claiming that they would be Britain 's most popular party if everyone who wanted to vote for them did . \nMr Kennedy also rejected suggestions that the defection of such a long-standing leftwing critic of the government as Mr Sedgemore proved that the Liberal Democrats were now to the left of Labor . \nDisillusioned Tory and Labor voters were equally attracted to the party 's commitment to scrap university tuition fees and provide free long-term care for the elderly , he said . \nMr Sedgemore , meanwhile , denied that he was a hard-left Labor MP of the old school , and pointed to the health secretary , John Reid , and his predecessor , Alan Milburn , as examples of politicians with Marxist baggage . \nHe would not , however , elaborate on a claim he made in the Independent today that there were more Labor politicians waiting to follow him out of the party . \n`` I am not alone , '' he wrote . \n`` A small group of us - all MPs who are standing down - decided we would leave the Labor party immediately after the election . '' \nGuardian Unlimited contacted a number of retiring Labor MPs , who all denied that they were planning to leave the party after the election . \nVeteran leftwinger Tony Banks said Mr Sedgemore 's claim that there were more Labor defectors in the wings was `` the easiest claim on earth '' to make . \n`` If he has any evidence he should put it forward . \nI just think Brian was looking around for company . \nFrankly , I deeply regret what he has done . '' \nTam Dalyell also denied planning to leave Labor , but said he wanted to see Mr Blair deposed . \n`` As far as I am concerned it is until death do us part . '' \nThe Labor leader himself was circumspect about Mr Sedgemore 's defection . \nMr Blair told reporters at Labor 's morning press conference that the election was about issues such as health , education and the economy . \n`` Let 's not allow the fate of one individual to distract us from that . '' \nMr Blair 's predecessor as Labor leader , Lord Kinnock , was more outspoken . \n`` What I am most concerned about is the feelings that will be engendered amongst his colleagues of three or four weeks ago from the parliamentary Labor party fighting marginal seats , '' he said . \n`` For them , his statement will appear to be a lance right through the spine .

'' Um ... kind of . \nMeanwhile , as part of our One to Watch series , we journey to Twickenham , where the Labor candidate disports himself with all the academic rigor of the attorney general . \nAt last Wednesday 's public meeting , a constituent questioned Brian Whitington 's defense of the 45-minute justification by asking why we never attacked the WMD-possessing Moscow during the cold war . \nAbsurd , retorted Brian - they 'd have only retaliated with WMD . \nCrystalline logic , but quite overshadowed when after the briefest of pauses he produced his trump card . \n`` But we did attack Russia , '' he explained . \n`` That 's why we backed Iraq in the war against Iran . \nIran was supported by Russia , so by backing Saddam we were attacking Russia . '' \nBrian is challenging Lib Dem treasury spokesman Vince Cable , though evidently not in any intellectual sense . \nThere is no such dumbing down in Crewe and Nantwich . \n`` While Cheshire county council is battling with a # 91m backlog of repairs , '' Tory candidate Eveleigh Moore-Dutton 's newsletter states , `` the government has seen fit to slash almost # 3m from the road maintenance fund . '' \nPerhaps it 's just us , but at this point things do seem to take a turn towards the opaque . \n`` Oratori agnascor quadrupei , '' Eveleigh goes on . \n`` Quinquennalis cathedras miscere agricolae , quamquam chirographi circumgrediet plane . '' \nBut how 's it playing on the streets ? \n`` It 's very simple , '' agent Donald Potter replies briskly . \n`` It 's just a printing error . '' \nWell , one can quite see how it happened . \nWarmest congratulations , finally , to police in Sutton 's Worcester Park area , who after a four-month surveillance operation have at last amassed sufficient evidence to shut down a notorious local crack house . \nThe property is located directly above Worcester Park police station , but splendid work for all that . \n"}

`` a coalition of the unwilling '' that would include the Europeans , the Russians and the Chinese - Blair has sided with the evil empire . \nHe has taken up a role as its principal cheerleader , obliging Britain to become a participant in its wars of aggression . \nToday 's Labor party has been a supine collaborator in this policy of appeasement , just like the Tory party in the 1930s . \nBlair 's war party must be defeated at the polls . \nThe most popular slogan at the moment is `` Blair must go '' . \nThis simple message echoes across the political spectrum from the Conservative party to Respect , and even into the ranks of Labor itself . \nIt clearly has majority support in the country . \nBlair is a war criminal who should be locked up behind bars without a vote , not standing for election . \nYet Labor party supporters who dislike Blair have a bitter pill to swallow . \nThe entire party shares in the war guilt of its leader and his silently complicit government . \nNew Labor may be self-destructing , but old Labor is in no better shape . \nIt was already in a terminal state of collapse in the 1970s , as the recent obituaries of Jim Callaghan have recalled . \nThe idea that a lively party exists that might rally behind Gordon Brown is a forlorn hope . \nThe Labor party is a shadow of its former self , as damaged and decimated as the trade union movement , and it will have no further role to play in the 21st century . \nGiven its recent record , that is an outcome to be welcomed . \nThe Tories , of course , are in no better shape . \nThey too are led by war criminals , caught up in supporting a war of aggression that their traditional Arabist loyalties might perhaps have led them to greet with less enthusiasm had they been in power at the time . \nTheir passivity over the war has occurred against a background of wider collapse , for the Tory party , like the monarchy , the Church of England and the BBC , is in terminal decline . \nThere will be no return to the automatic Tory majorities of the 20th century . \nA freak Tory victory would hardly last a twelvemonth . \nAt the last election I chose the Abstention party , and it romped home to a spectacular victory . \nMany may feel disposed to support it again , since the choices on offer are so singularly unattractive . \nThe degeneration of British politics and the inability of a pusillanimous generation of MPs to prevent the slide to war continue to make abstention an attractive option . \nYet the background mood to this election , not necessarily reflected in the opinion polls , remains this deep sense of anger and resentment against the Blair government , even of disgust , and this may yet drive people to vote rather than abstain , and lead to an unusual result . \nThis year , because of the serious and lasting disaffection of a large slice of the electorate that traditionally sees it as its duty to vote , there is a slim but realistic chance of a change . \nVotes cast thoughtfully rather than tribally could bring about a breakthrough that would not only destroy the Blair government but create a new political framework . \nEach individual voter must use the vote to secure an anti-war majority in parliament , and to this end it will be necessary to vote in most cases , for the Liberal Democrats and occasionally for Respect or the Greens . \nYet no one should be ashamed of voting for Tories who voted in parliament against the war . \nAncient animosities must be set aside , as they were in the Commons vote that brought down Chamberlain . \nThe ideal outcome would be that the vagaries of the existing electoral system , which requires the selection of a local MP rather than a party leader , throws up a result in which the three main parties would each have approximately 30 % of the MPs in the new House of Commons . \nThe resulting hung parliament would bring home the troops from Iraq , just as the Spanish electorate was able to do . \nIt would also have a further benefit , producing fresh electoral arrangements and the possible revival of interest in politics within the parliamentary arena . \nThat might be unlikely , but is the most optimistic scenario that might emerge from the current contest . \nRichard Gott is the author , with Martin Gilbert , of The Appeasers , republished by the Phoenix Press Letters for publication should be sent to : letters@guardian.co.uk If you need help using the site : userhelp@guardian.co.uk Call the main Guardian and Observer switchboard : This article was published on guardian . \n"}
{"id": "44", "time": "2005-03-31", "text": "US unilateralism was a means of breaking the old order . \nNow it is building new alliances Thursday 31 March 2005 01.37 BST With any new political phenomenon , there is always a tendency to underestimate its novelty and treat it as some kind of short-term aberration . \nI vividly recall how long it took commentators and analysts , on the right and left , to recognize that Thatcherism was something quite new and here to stay . \nSimilar doubts greeted the Bush administration and the neocon revolution : its novelty would be short-lived , it would not last and it was just not viable . \nIt is always hard to imagine a new kind of world , easier to think of the future as an extension of the past , and difficult to comprehend a paradigm shift and grasp a new kind of logic . \nThere was speculation last autumn that the second Bush term would be different , that the breach with Europe would be healed as a matter of necessity , that the US could not afford another Iraq , that somehow the new position was unsustainable . \nAlready , however , from last November 's presidential election it was clear that the neocon revolution had wide popular support and serious electoral roots , that it was establishing a new kind of domestic political hegemony . \nIn fact , the right has been setting the political agenda in the US for at least 30 years and that is now true with a vengeance . \nAll the indications suggest that the revolution is continuing apace . \nThe appointment of John Bolton as the US ambassador to the United Nations and the nomination of Paul Wolfowitz as president of the World Bank reveal a determination to place the cadres of the neocon revolution in key positions of power and influence and thereby create the conditions for its continuation and expansion . \nThis was heralded almost immediately after the presidential election with the decision to replace Colin Powell , a man of very different political hue , with Condoleezza Rice as secretary of state . \nDuring the first Bush administration , and especially in its conduct of the Iraq war , the neocon revolution was often characterised as unilateralist , but this was always somewhat simplistic . \nNo nation can simply go it alone , certainly not one that seeks to dominate the world . \nHowever strong it may be , it is still required to pursue its power and ambitions through a system of alliances . \nThe end of the cold war led to the realisation that the US was now the world 's sole superpower . \nThe period following 9\\/11 persuaded the Americans that they now had an opportunity to remake the world in their own image , that the alliances that had been necessary in pursuit of the cold war , notably that with Europe , were no longer appropriate , certainly not on the old terms . \nThe US has similarly renounced , or chosen to ignore , many of the international treaties that it had previously been party to - Kyoto , the international criminal court , even the Geneva conventions - either because it no longer believed in them or because it regarded them as a threat to the exercise of a new kind of American power . \nBut it would be more accurate to see this unilateralism as a phase rather than a permanent new condition , as a means of breaking the old order rather than a long-term strategy for the new . \nThe Bush administration has displayed a differential calculus . \nThe heart of its strategy has been concerned with the Middle East where it has deployed a unilateralist policy of pre-emptive strikes and regime change as part of a wider attempt to remake the region . \nThe Europeans were disregarded and relegated to the role of bystanders . \nIn East Asia , the Americans have behaved quite differently . \nNorth Korea , like Iraq and Iran , was part of the axis of evil , but there has been no attempt at regime change . \nNorth Korea 's nuclear weapons , the geographical proximity of Seoul , the opposition of South Korea towards precipitous action , and the role and interest of China , have obliged the Americans to move with caution . \nFar from unilateralism , they have vested their efforts in the six-party talks , and the hope that China might act as a restraining force on Pyongyang . \nIn the longer run , China remains the greatest global challenge to the US . \nBut here again the Americans have moved with care and restraint . \nThey sought to enlist China in the war against terror following 9\\/11 , and since then relations between the two have been relatively calm . \nMeanwhile , the Americans will continue to give tacit support to Taiwan and quietly encourage Japan 's growing nationalism as a bulwark against China and a means of protecting their own role in the region . \nIt is clear , in this context , that there are three main elements to American unilateralism : Iraq and the Middle East ; the Atlantic alliance ; and the US 's attitude towards international treaties and law . \nAlthough the Americans flagrantly ignored the Europeans over Iraq , and have loosened the bonds that previously existed in a way that undermines the notion of the west as shaped in the crucible of the cold war , they will seek to build a new relationship with Europe , albeit one far less intimate and far more unequal than before . \nAs for Europe , there would appear to be clear limits as to how far it is prepared to go to resist the Americans . \nThere are two small defining moments in this process . \nThe Europeans may feel decidedly uneasy about Wolfowitz becoming president of the World Bank - with the exception , of course , of Bush 's European lapdog , our prime minister - but they are evidently going to acquiesce . \nAmerican and European dominance of the institutions of the international economy ensures that the two will continue to cooperate , even if the relationship is likely to be more tense and fractious . \nThe other example is the European Union 's attitude towards the arms embargo with China . \nUnder American pressure , the likely decision to lift it will now be postponed : the ties are still sufficiently strong for Europe not to wish to anger the Americans beyond a certain point . \nThe prospects of a drift towards any form of triangulation in the relationship between the US , Europe and China , even at the edges , are still very distant . \nThe withdrawal of the US from international treaties does not condemn international law to the dustbin of history . \nIt is evident , however , that the Americans are determined either to render these treaties redundant simply by ignoring them , force them to be renegotiated or perhaps both . \nIn effect , what the Americans are intent on doing is reordering the world system to take account of their newly defined power and interests . \nEvery part of the world is likely to feel the consequences of this geo-political earthquake , but some much more than others . \nThe restless determination of the Bush administration to reorder global affairs is well-illustrated by a classified document prepared by the US defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld as a prelude to a massive review of Pentagon spending . \nIt requires the military to build a far more proactive force focused on changing the world rather than responding to specific conflicts such as the Korean peninsula . \nIt sees the development of very differently trained troops who would be able to intervene on a much more widespread basis . \n`` The idea is that you would have lots of teams operating in lots of places throughout the world , '' a senior defense official was reported as saying . \nAt the same time , there is an absolute belief that the US must maintain such a large lead in crucial technologies that growing powers - in other words , China - will decide that it is simply too expensive to try to compete . \nWelcome to the new world order as seen from Washington . \n"}
{"id": "302", "time": "2005-03-31", "text": "Thursday 31 March 2005 00.05 BST A final analysis of the intelligence fiasco over Iraq 's non-existent weapons of mass destruction will today focus blame on the CIA and other spy agencies , largely clearing the White House and the Pentagon of allegations that they shaped the intelligence to justify the invasion , according to early accounts of the report . \nThe assessment by a presidential commission on WMD intelligence follows 14 months of mostly secret inquiries in an undisclosed location in Virginia . \nIt reportedly concentrates on mistakes in a multi-agency assessment in October 2002 , the national intelligence estimate , which portrayed Saddam Hussein 's weapons programs as a serious threat to the US . \nA year-long search by the US Iraq survey group later concluded that those programs had collapsed more than a decade before the invasion . \nThe commission is expected to release a 400-page unclassified version of its report after delivering a complete version to George Bush this morning . \nAccording to leaks , the commission found that many of the intelligence shortcomings on Iraq are being repeated on Iran and North Korea . \nIn all three cases , the commission is said to have found that human intelligence - actual spies - are in short supply , and intelligence has relied on satellite pictures , electronic intercepts , the testimony of exiles and guesswork . \nThe Los Angeles Times yesterday quoted officials who had read some of the unclassified report as saying it pointed to `` glaring gaps in core US intelligence '' about nuclear programs pursued by Tehran and Pyongyang . \nAccording to the Washington Post the report will recommend that , in the light of `` group think '' over Iraq , dissent and debate should be encouraged among the nation 's 15 intelligence agencies . \nHowever , there will be relatively little scrutiny of alleged political pressure by senior administration officials to exaggerate the WMD claims . \n`` There 's nothing really about shaping the intelligence , '' said an intelligence source in Washington familiar with the report . \nA Senate inquiry into political manipulation of intelligence , postponed until after the November elections , now appears to have been quietly dropped by its Republican chairman , Pat Roberts . \nRay McGovern , a former CIA official and persistent government critic , said the report was diverting the blame . \n`` I see it as part of the continuing attempt to blame the CIA and other intelligence agencies and divert attention away from the White House and the Pentagon . \nIt 's worse than Butler -LRB- the inquiry into British intelligence shortcomings -RRB- , or anything you 've had over there . '' \nDick Cheney made several trips to the CIA 's Langley headquarters in the months before the war to discuss findings on Iraq 's alleged WMD , and the agency 's ombudsman told the Senate that analysts had undergone constant `` hammering '' to come up with a connection between al-Qaida and Saddam . \nHowever , none of the CIA employees who testified before the Senate intelligence committee on the issue last year admitted changing their analysis to suit the administration 's wishes . \nToday 's report is expected to find that political pressure was not a significant factor , although it will advocate the creation of an ombudsman to hear from analysts who fear their work is being compromised , according to the Washington Post . \nIt will reportedly include criticism of the Defense Intelligence Agency and the National Security Agency , both under the Pentagon 's control . \nBut the burden of blame will fall once more on the CIA . \n`` I 'm told it is going to make the CIA look even worse than before , '' said Melvin Goodman , a former CIA official . \nAs for top administration officials , Mr Goodman said : `` It looks like they 're going to escape again .

{"id": "284", "time": "2005-04-19", "text": "The man who would not die Ten months ago , a BBC journalist and Irish cameraman set off on a seemingly safe assignment in Saudi Arabia . \nThe trip left the reporter fighting for his life and his colleague dead . \nNow , for the first time , Frank Gardner tells his extraordinary tale of survival . \nBy James Meek In spite of all he has endured , Frank Gardner retains his BBC voice - clear , measured , concise , registering on my old tape recorder perfectly through the din of helicopters and passenger jets passing over the cafe where we meet . \nHis wheelchair is pulled up to the table . \nHe has put back a little of the weight he lost in hospital . \nIt 's a glorious early spring day , in a pleasant spot , 10 months after he was shot , but on his face , almost all the time , apart from the occasional smile , is an expression of frowning concentration , such as you see on the face of TV reporters who are first on the scene of a terrible disaster . \nIt is quite unaffected : Gardner is still reporting from inside himself , from the war which entered him last summer , scene of his grief at the death of his colleague Simon Cumbers , his anger towards the killers , and the physical destruction of his body , which goes on causing him pain - pain that ca n't be eased without punishing side effects . \n`` I just think it 's cowardice to shoot somebody who 's defenceless . \nThat is n't brave , that 's not making a stand for your beliefs , that 's just cowardice . \nWhat kind of a battle is that ? \nIt 's one thing for them to be taking on the police in a shootout , but taking on a couple of unarmed , defenceless journalists ? '' \nThere were times when Gardner and Cumbers would feel nervous about where they were going , but June 6 2004 , in Riyadh , Saudi Arabia , was n't one of them . \nThe district of the Saudi capital they were visiting had , it is true , been the scene of a shootout between security forces and Islamist fundamentalist militants six months earlier - that was why the two BBC men were going , to film some general footage of the area - but they did n't feel they were taking a risk . \nThis was n't Fallujah , or some Taliban stronghold in southern Afghanistan . \nThis was neat , rich , outwardly modern , usually safe Riyadh . \nGardner , the BBC 's security correspondent , a fluent Arab speaker at home in the Gulf , and Cumbers , an experienced cameraman , had waited for permission from the Saudi ministry of information before going . \nThey even had a government minder with them , and a government driver in a government van . \nIt was their last job , on the last day of their assignment to Saudi . \nTheir flights to London were booked for the next day . \nIn war zones , journalists on their final day tend to get jumpy but this was n't a war zone . \nThe only anxiety left was over the story - had they got good material ? \n- blending with warm anticipation of going home . \nGardner and Cumbers reached the area in the late afternoon . \n`` It looked a completely normal Gulf residential suburb ... peachy colored villas , bougainvillea coming down the walls , very average , a couple of kids playing in the street , nobody suspicious lurking in doorways and whispering or anything like that , '' says Gardner . \nThey filmed for half an hour , and prepared to leave . \nCumbers was taking his camera off its tripod . \nThey might as well have been on the plane home already . \nGardner registered a car parking a short distance away , but it did n't come to a halt with a screech of tires and brakes . \nThe banal sound of car doors , the two nondescript young men strolling towards them in ordinary white Saudi tunics : at first Gardner assumed they were friends of the driver . \nToo late , as the men advanced , Gardner understood . \nOne of them - a beardless , completely average young man , in Gardner 's description - took out a pistol . \n`` I shouted , in Arabic , stupidly : ` No , do n't do this ! ' \nas soon as I saw him pulling out the pistol , '' says Gardner . \n`` He was probably 30 metres from me and I took off at once - and I presume Simon ran at the same time . \nWe ran in different directions . \nWe had no time to make a plan . '' \nGardner ran from the gunman , deeper into the district . \nHe heard a shot and something stung his shoulder . \nA bullet had passed through him . \nThere were more shots . \nHe was hit in the leg , his leg bone was fractured , and he fell , on a patch of waste ground . \n`` The adrenalin was really pumping so initially the shooting did n't hurt . \nIt felt like a massive thump . \nWith each bullet that went in it was like being picked up by a giant hand and slammed on the ground . '' \nStill , these were not deadly wounds . \nHe would have made a full recovery . \nBut the militants were n't finished . \nA second vehicle drew up alongside him , a cargo van . \nGardner found himself looking up into the side doorway of the van where three militants crouched , looking at him . \nOne of them was pointing a pistol . \n`` I pleaded with them in Arabic not to shoot me , '' says Gardner . \n`` They had a very quick discussion among themselves . \nI could n't pick up what they were saying . \nThen they emptied the pistol into me at pretty much point-blank range . '' \nFour 9mm bullets smashed into Gardner 's spinal nerves , pelvis and abdomen . \nGardner remembers the expression on the face of the man who shot him . \n`` It was a sneer . \nIt was a sneer of contempt , of hatred . \nMaybe he saw in me President Bush , Tony Blair , Ariel Sharon , Donald Rumsfeld , all rolled into one . \nI do n't know . \nHe did n't see me as a non-partisan reporter who 's simply just trying to report what 's going on . \nHe saw me as the enemy . '' \nGardner found himself lying on his front , amazed to be still alive and conscious . \nHe closed his eyes and pretended to be dead . \nHe heard the feet of one of the militants walking around him and prepared to die . \n`` I thought this is it , this is going to be the execution shot in the back of the head . '' \nHe felt the gunman rooting in his back trouser pockets . \nIn one , he found Cumbers ' radio mike . \nIn the other he found a miniature Qur ` an of the kind Gardner often gave out as gifts . \nThat discovery , Gardner believes , may have saved his life , by giving the killer pause for thought . \nThe militants drove off , leaving him bleeding in the dust . \nGardner rolled over and cried for help . \nHis legs were paralysed . \n`` My cries were just a sort of animal pain ... it was almost beyond pain . \nI 'm amazed I did n't black out . \nMaybe some of the stomach acid had leaked , I do n't know . '' \nThe locals who gathered at the scene astonished Gardner by their behavior . \nIt was as if , by being shot , he had put himself in a world beyond them . \n`` They did n't help at all . \nTo me this was extraordinary , they offered no reassurance , no glass of water , no blanket , no cushion , nothing . \nThey were discussing the cartridge cases around . \nThey were saying , ` Look , I think he 's been shot , has he been shot , yes , he has , look at the bullet cases there , ' as if I was just an exhibit in a museum . \nIt was bizarre because I 've had so much hospitality in the Middle East , so much kindness . '' \nInstead of an ambulance , two police cars arrived . \nHe was manhandled into the back of one of them and driven off , screaming in pain , to hospital . \n`` It took them a long time to get me out of the police car and on to a hospital trolley , there was pulling and pushing and arguing . \nI remember them wheeling me into the operating theater and me shouting for painkiller and somebody injected me - and then I was out and I did n't come back up for eight days . '' \nWhen he woke up , he saw his wife , Amanda . \n`` It was fantastic to sort of swim up the surface of consciousness and open my eyes and see her there and although I was pretty groggy I asked a number of questions . \nI said : ` What 's happened to Simon ? ' \nAnd she said : ` He did n't make it . ' '' \nCumbers , Gardner found out later , ran at right angles to him . \nHe managed to run for about a kilometre , carrying his heavy Betacam camera , but could n't find any cover . \nThe militants shot him in the head . \nIn his eight days of drug-induced unconsciousness , Gardner himself came close to death . \nThe first team of surgeons was well-intentioned but inexperienced . \nWhile they tried to patch him up , bullet hole by bullet hole , his life was slipping away . \nTwo things saved him . \nOne was that the governor of Riyadh heard what had happened and dispatched an emergency team , with a mobile intensive-care unit , from one of the city 's best hospitals , the King Faisal . \nThe other was that the team was led by a South African , Peter Bautz , who happened to specialise in gunshot wounds . \nBautz 's team operated on Gardner for the next 40 hours as he went in and out of surgery . \nThey operated on his stomach so many times - nine - that they did n't even close it up between operations , just kept it covered . \n`` My intestines were very shot up , they had to take out quite a lot of them , there was internal bleeding , there was pus , fecal matter in there , there were infections , I had acute lead poisoning from one of the bullets . \nDr Bautz told me one bullet went in , out and in again , somehow . \nSo I was in quite a state . '' \nThis was the beginning of a medical ordeal that continues . \nThe Saudis paid for Gardner 's air ambulance back to Britain . \nMonths of operations and recovery followed at the Royal London - where , despite superb care from a constellation of specialists , Gardner endured weeks of fever and vomiting as the result of infection from a feeding tube - and the Chelsea and Westminster . \nIncredibly , his major organs - liver , kidney , lungs , liver , stomach , heart - are relatively undamaged , and he now digests his food . \nHe has lost part of his colon and his intestines , but has been told that he can do without them . \nHis shoulder and leg wounds have healed . \nEven his spine is largely intact . \nYet none of this is much comfort to Gardner and his family , because he still can not walk , and will never fully recover the use of his legs . \nThe militant 's bullets severely damaged the cascade of nerves connecting the spine with the legs . \nSome were cut , and they do n't grow back . \nGardner has not experienced any of the symptoms of post-traumatic stress as a result of the horror he experienced . \nAll his troubles now are related to being suddenly thrust into the ranks of Britain 's estimated 40,000 spinal cord injury sufferers . \n`` The most stressful thing is coping with being disabled . \nSpinal injury is a complete life changer , '' he says . \n`` There is life before the injury and life afterwards and in a way that has dwarfed the horror of what happened . '' \nAfter the attack , when he was lying in the dirt , says Gardner , `` I never reconciled myself to dying , no , absolutely not . \nI never , ever thought this is all too difficult , I 'll just give up and die . \nIt was thoughts of my family that kept me going . \nI love my family so much I want to carry on being a father and a husband to them . '' \nNow the family - Gardner and his wife have two daughters , aged six and seven - are reunited , and it has been hard . \n`` My wife has just been an amazing support , she has been so understanding . \nShe married an able-bodied person and she 's now got a disabled husband . \nThat 's tough for her as well . \nPhysically , I 've gone from being a runner who 's quite robust to being somebody who 's in a wheelchair and quite vulnerable , essentially . '' \n`` The younger one has taken it in her stride , I think she 's fine . \nThe older one , it 's been quite tough for her . \nShe was very shocked when it happened , she was wandering round the playground in a daze . \nShe was asking , ` Why did n't they shoot daddy with a water pistol ? \nWhy did it have to be bullets ? ' \nFor a six year old , as she was last year , she should n't be having to ask questions like that , she should n't even know what a bullet is . \n`` They 're much better now that I 'm back home . \nI was away in hospital for seven or eight months . \nAt least now I 'm able to read them their bedtime story every night . \nThe tough thing is that I was very physical with them before . \nParticularly with the older one . \nI 'd take her rock climbing and teach her rollerblading and take them swimming every weekend ... I 'm getting stronger , but when I first came back from my operation in January I would eat a few morsels of food and then have to go and lie down feeling sick . \nSo I 've not had the same energy and dynamism that I had before . \nBut I 'm having to find new things to do with them , like chess . \nThey both love chess . '' \nGardner 's fascination with the Arab world , which took him around the Middle East as an investment banker and , since 1995 , as a BBC journalist , began when he was 16 . \nHis mother took him to meet a friend , the late Wilfred Thesiger , the writer and explorer who had lived among the Arabs of the Empty Quarter in Arabia and the marshes of Iraq . \nSitting in Thesiger 's little flat in Chelsea , drinking tea , the young Gardner was not put off by the veteran 's disgust with the modernisation of the oil-era Middle East . \nHe was inspired by Thesiger 's pictures and stories from the older Arab milieux of the 1940s and 1950s , and resolved to become an Arabist . \nHe read Arabic and Islamic studies at Exeter , but found the academic course tough going . \nIt was only when the university sent him to Cairo for a year that he blossomed . \nHe stopped going to classes , moved in with an Egyptian family in one of the city 's medieval slums , and acquired fluent Arabic . \nA few years later he spent time living with the Bedu in Jordan , in the desert near Aqaba . \n`` By day I would go out with the shepherds and we 'd wander for miles with the goats and sheep over the dunes , drinking goat 's milk , but then when it was Ramadan we had to fast , and I fasted with them , and at night there would be these huge feasts , tribes would come from all around ... it was a wonderful time . \nThey would tell stories under the stars and somebody would play a rababo , a stringed instrument that makes a very mournful sound , and then somebody would recite traditional poetry . \n`` Since then I 've made many Arab friends , mostly Muslim , some Christian . \nI 've loved living in the Middle East . \nIt has been good to us . \nI met my wife in the Gulf . \nSome of the nicest people I 've ever met were in Bahrain , Oman and Saudi Arabia . \n`` Would I go back to Saudi Arabia now ? \nI would n't put my family , my parents , through that , even if I wanted to . \nAlso I would n't want to go back and be seeming to thumb my nose at al-Qaida and say ` Na-na-na-na-na , you did n't get me . ' \nI 'm sure they were n't deliberately targeting me because of the job I do . \nIf they were , it 's an own goal , because they knocked out almost the only western broadcaster who bothers to explain what al-Qaida 's complaints are , what their motivation is , so taking me off the air for nearly a year would be a pretty stupid thing to do . '' \nGardner has just gone back to his old job at the BBC - effectively , the Corporation 's `` war on terror '' correspondent . \nHe remains a tough critic of the Iraq war , dismissing the popular US belief that there was a link between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaida . \nBut would what had happened to him influence his wider reporting ? \nBy way of an answer , Gardner says he had found inspiration in Daniel Pearl , the Wall Street Journal reporter executed by Islamic radicals in 2002 . \nBefore his death , he had used his knowledge of these terror groups to explain , not condemn . \nGardner says that having survived a similar execution attempt he wanted to show that , by targeting journalists who sought to explain the reasons behind their actions , the militants were only hurting their cause . \nNot that this means forgiving the individuals who shot him and Cumbers . \n`` I will try very hard to be as objective as I was before . \nDo I forgive the people who did this to me ? \nNo , of course not . \nThey have n't apologised , they showed no mercy . \nI 've had no little note saying , ` Gosh , we feel sorry about what we did . ' '' \nThe Saudis claim that two of the five men who shot Gardner and Cumbers have been killed in subsequent shootouts , but have not made clear how they reached this conclusion . \nNor have they allowed British investigators to talk to the unarmed government minder , whose actions during the attack remain a mystery to Gardner . \n`` It 's particularly tough for Simon 's widow , because , of course , she 'd like to know that the people who killed her husband have been brought to justice or that there 's some kind of accountability . '' \nGardner gets tired easily these days , but seems astonishingly busy . \nBesides going back to work , writing a book and spending time with his family , he is doing all he can to start walking again . \nHe is undergoing physiotherapy at Stanmore hospital . \n`` By the time this piece comes out I will be starting to walk with calipers , but only for an hour or two a day , because it 's pretty exhausting , and it 's not terribly efficient either , which is why a lot of spinally injured patients tend to just stick with a wheelchair , '' he says . \n`` There is still hope , but the prognosis from Stanmore is that I will be a long-term wheelchair user . \nThe best end point I think I can hope for is that I will only need splints from the knees downwards . \nI 've been told I will never get my feet back ; my feet are gone , basically . \nThey 're still there , but I ca n't feel anything . \nI have continual nerve pain in my legs . \nIt keeps me awake at night . \nI never thought that nearly a year on from the injuries I 'd still be in so much pain . '' \nGardner 's pain specialists have told him they can not increase medication without giving him side effects such as drowsiness and headaches , which he refuses to countenance . \nWhat he had not realized before about spinal injury , he says , is that feeling sorry for someone in a wheelchair because they ca n't walk is not the half of it . \n`` What you do n't see is the internal stuff . \nWhen you 're spinally injured you also usually lose control of your bladder and bowels . \nIn my case mine were so shot up that I had to have things like catheters and bags anyhow , so it 's irrelevant for me , but for other people , that is one of the hardest things . \nThey 're having to use suppositories to empty their bowels , they 're having to put these awful catheters up their genitals - it 's really tough . \nWhich is why I think a lot of spinally injured people have this sort of pained expression on their face . \n`` Several things have kept me smiling : being back with my family , writing a book and improving with physio . \nI think there will come a time when my locomotive improvement will hit the buffers , and I think that will be quite a depressing time . \nAt which point I 'll start investigating disabled sports such as disabled skiing and scuba diving . \nLife 's got to go on . \n`` I want my life back . \nI accept it 's never going to be the same as the life I had before injury but I 'm determined to make the most of it . \nAnd one day I 'll go off and do something completely different .

'' \nShe continued her lobbying and got $ 20m for victims in Iraq . \nShe also developed contacts in the US military , trying to get them to describe otherwise unreported incidents , and take responsibility . \nIn a typical entry from her journal , published on AlterNet on November 6 2003 , she reported : `` On October 24 , former teacher Mohammad Kadhum Mansoor , 59 , and his wife , Hamdia Radhi Kadhum , 45 , were traveling with their three daughters - Beraa , 21 , Fatima , 8 , and Ayat , 5 - when they were tragically run over by an American tank . \n`` A grenade was thrown at the tank , causing it to lose control and veer on to the highway , over the family 's small Volkswagen . \nMohammad and Hamdia were killed instantly , orphaning the three girls in the back seat . \nThe girls survived , but with broken and fractured bodies . \nWe are not sure of Ayat 's fate ; her backbone is broken . \n`` CIVIC staff member Faiz Al Salaam monitors the girls ' condition each day . \nNobody in the military or the US army has visited them , nor has anyone offered to help this very poor family . '' \nBorn in the small town of Lakeport , California , Marla became politically active at the age of 15 , when she was suspended from high school for leading a protest against the first Gulf war . \nWhile at Long Island University , she traveled extensively , visiting Cuba , Guatemala , southern Africa and the West Bank . \nShe was already working as a volunteer for Global Exchange . \nDespite her exuberant exterior , she was not always happy , and her activism was sometimes both an obsession and a therapy . \nFor exercise in Baghdad , she regularly stormed up and down the pool at the al Hamra hotel , the headquarters of the newspapers which preferred not to have large , guarded villas . \nLast new year 's eve , she emailed friends : `` 2005 is going to rock for you all and me too ... I write to you from the Himalayan mountains , where I am on a seven-day trek . \nWow , is my mind clear , and I have many goals for 2005 . \nAfter my trek , I 'll work on a campaign to protect Nepalese activists - there have been over 3,000 disappearances here - more than Colombia . \nThen I am off to Afghanistan to check on the families who lost loved ones in Operation Enduring Freedom . '' \nMarla had also been planning to spend more time fundraising in the US . \nShe had an initial grant from George Soros 's Open Society Institute , but wanted to develop more sources . \nAfter the Iraq election in January , she decided to make another trip to Baghdad . \nMedea Benjamin , her original mentor at Global Exchange , tried to dissuade her because of the increased danger . \n`` I thought it would be better to wait for a while and see if the situation got better than to put her life at risk , '' she told the Los Angeles Times . \n`` She was determined to go because the people she worked with did n't have the luxury not to be at risk .

{"id": "181", "time": "2005-11-29", "text": "After what has been described as the most foolish war in over 2,000 years , is there a way out of Iraq for President Bush , asks Brian Whitaker Tuesday 29 November 2005 13.54 GMT There is a remarkable article in the latest issue of the American Jewish weekly , Forward . \nIt calls for President Bush to be impeached and put on trial `` for misleading the American people , and launching the most foolish war since Emperor Augustus in 9 BC sent his legions into Germany and lost them '' . \nTo describe Iraq as the most foolish war of the last 2,014 years is a sweeping statement , but the writer is well qualified to know . \nHe is Martin van Creveld , a professor at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem and one of the world 's foremost military historians . \nSeveral of his books have influenced modern military theory and he is the only non-American author on the US Army 's list of required reading for officers . \nProfessor van Creveld has previously drawn parallels between Iraq and Vietnam , and pointed out that almost all countries that have tried to fight similar wars during the last 60 years or so have ended up losing . \nWhy President Bush `` nevertheless decided to go to war escapes me and will no doubt preoccupy historians to come , '' he told one interviewer . \nThe professor 's puzzlement is understandable . \nMore than two years after the war began , and despite the huge financial and human cost , it is difficult to see any real benefits . \nThe weapons of mass destruction that provided the excuse for the invasion turned out not to exist and the idea that Iraq could become a beacon of democracy for the Middle East has proved equally far-fetched . \nTrue , there is now a multi-party electoral system , but it has institutionalised and consolidated the country 's ethnic , sectarian and tribal divisions - exactly the sort of thing that should be avoided when attempting to democratise . \nIn the absence of anything more positive , Tony Blair has fallen back on the claim that at least we 're better off now without Saddam Hussein . \nThat , too , sounds increasingly hollow . \nThe fall of Saddam has brought the rise of Zarqawi and his ilk , levels of corruption in Iraq seem as bad as ever , and at the weekend former prime minister Iyad Allawi caused a stir by asserting that the human rights are no better protected now than under the rule of Saddam . \nNoting that some two-thirds of Americans believe the war was a mistake , van Creveld says in his article that the US should forget about saving face and pull its troops out : `` What had to come , has come . \nThe question is no longer if American forces will be withdrawn , but how soon - and at what cost . '' \nWelcome as a pullout might be to many Americans , it would be a hugely complex operation . \nVan Creveld says it would probably take several months and result in sizeable casualties . \nMore significantly , though , it would not end the conflict . \n`` As the pullout proceeds , '' he warns , `` Iraq almost certainly will sink into an all-out civil war from which it will take the country a long time to emerge - if , indeed , it can do so at all . \nAll this is inevitable and will take place whether George W Bush , Dick Cheney , Donald Rumsfeld and Condoleezza Rice like it or not . '' \nThis is one of the major differences between Iraq and the withdrawal from Vietnam . \nIn Vietnam , it took place under a smokescreen of `` Vietnamisation '' in which US troops handed control to local forces in the south . \nOf course , it was a fairly thin smokescreen ; many people were aware at the time that these southern forces could not hold out and in due course the North Vietnamese overran the south , finally bringing the war to an end . \nOfficially , a similar process is under way in Iraq , with the Americans saying they will eventually hand over to the new Iraqi army - though the chances of that succeeding look even bleaker than they did in Vietnam . \n`` The new Iraqi army is by all accounts much weaker , less skilled , less cohesive and less loyal to its government than even the South Vietnamese army was , '' van Creveld writes . \nWorse still , in Iraq there is no equivalent of the North Vietnamese regime poised to take power . \nWhat will happen once the Americans have gone is anyone 's guess , but a sudden outbreak of peace seems the remotest of all the possibilities . \nNot surprisingly , many who in principle would argue that the Americans had no right to invade Iraq in the first place are apprehensive about what might happen once they leave . \nThe conference organised by the Arab League in Cairo last week was one example : it called for `` the withdrawal of foreign forces according to a timetable '' but did n't venture to suggest what that timetable might be . \nWith or without American troops , the war in Iraq has acquired a momentum of its own and threatens to spill over into other parts of the region . \nThere are four major issues : terrorism , Sunni-Shia rivalries , Kurdish aspirations , and the question of Iraq 's territorial integrity - all of which pose dangers internationally . \nBack in July 2003 , terrorism in Iraq seemed a manageable problem and President Bush boldly challenged the militants to `` bring 'em on '' . \nAmerican forces , he said , were `` plenty tough '' and would deal with anyone who attacked them . \nThere were others in the US who talked of the `` flypaper theory '' - an idea that terrorists from around the world could be attracted to Iraq and then eliminated . \nWell , the first part of the flypaper theory seems to work , but not the second . \nAs with the Afghan war in the 1980s that spawned al-Qaida , there is every reason to suppose that the Iraq war will create a new generation of terrorists with expertise that can be used to plague other parts of the world for decades to come . \nThe recent hotel bombings in Jordan are one indication of the way it 's heading . \nContrary to American intentions , the war has also greatly increased the influence of Iran - a founder-member of Bush 's `` Axis of Evil '' - and opened up long-suppressed rivalries between Sunni and Shia Muslims . \nThe impact of this can not be confined to Iraq and will eventually be felt in the oil-rich Sunni Gulf states -LRB- including Saudi Arabia -RRB- that have sizeable but marginalised Shia communities . \nKurdish aspirations have been awakened too - which has implications for Turkey , Syria and Iran , especially if Iraq is eventually dismembered . \nWith a fragile central government in Baghdad constantly undermined by the activities of militants and weakened by the conflicting demands of Sunnis , Shias and Kurds , the demise of Iraq as a nation-state sometime during the next few years has become a distinct possibility . \nThe effect of that on the regional power balance is difficult to predict , but at the very least it would bring a period of increased instability . \nNo one can claim that any of this was unexpected . \nThe dangers had been foreseen by numerous analysts and commentators long before the war started but they were ignored in Washington , mainly for ideological reasons . \nThere were , of course , some in the neoconservative lobby who foresaw it too and thought it would be a good thing - shaking up the entire Middle East in a wave of `` creative destruction '' . \nThe result is that even if the US tries to leave Iraq now , in purely practical terms it is unlikely to be able to do so . \nProfessor van Creveld 's plan for withdrawal of ground troops is not so much a disengagement as a strategic readjustment . \nAn American military presence will still be needed in the region , he says . \n`` Tehran is certain to emerge as the biggest winner from the war ... Now that Iraq is gone , it is hard to see how anybody except the United States can keep the Gulf states , and their oil , out of the mullahs ' clutches . \n`` A divided , chaotic , government-less Iraq is very likely to become a hornets ' nest . \nFrom it , a hundred mini-Zarqawis will spread all over the Middle East , conducting acts of sabotage and seeking to overthrow governments in Allah 's name . \n`` The Gulf States apart , the most vulnerable country is Jordan , as evidenced by the recent attacks in Amman . \nHowever , Turkey , Egypt and , to a lesser extent , Israel are also likely to feel the impact . \nSome of these countries , Jordan in particular , are going to require American assistance . '' \nAs described in the article , van Creveld 's plan seems to imply that the US should abandon Iraq to its fate and concentrate instead on protecting American allies in the region from adverse consequences . \nA slightly different idea - pulling out ground troops from Iraq but continuing to use air power there - is already being considered in Washington , according to Seymour Hersh in the latest issue of the New Yorker magazine . \nThe military are reportedly unhappy about this , fearing it could make them dependent on untrustworthy Iraqi forces for pinpointing targets . \nOne military planner quoted by the magazine asked : `` Will the Iraqis call in air strikes in order to snuff rivals , or other warlords , or to snuff members of your own sect and blame it on someone else ? '' \nFocusing on air power has obvious political attractions for the Bush administration , since it is the safety of US ground troops that American voters are most concerned about . \nBut , again , that would not amount to a real disengagement and would do little or nothing to improve America 's image in the region - especially if reliance on air strikes increased the number of civilian casualties . \nThe inescapable fact is that the processes Mr Bush unleashed on March 20 2003 -LRB- and imagined he had ended with his `` mission accomplished '' speech six weeks later -RRB- will take a decade or more to run their course and there is little that anyone , even the US , can do now to halt them . \nIn his eagerness for regime change in Iraq , Mr Bush blundered into a trap from which in the short term there is no way out : the Americans will be damned if they stay and damned if they leave . \nThis series is no longer updated \n"}

'' \nCindy , who has three surviving children , is weary . \nShe 's had to cram her six-foot frame into economy class for the trip , and , besides , her life has become an exhausting series of meetings , rallies , interviews , speeches and anti-war campaigning . \nShe has come a long way from her old life in Vacaville , California - not the sort of place normally associated with political activism . \nCamp Casey has closed down , at least for the winter , but Cindy remains a powerful symbol of the anti-war movement . \nHere is a mother who lost her eldest child in a war that was declared , she believes , on dubious grounds . \nShe wants to make sure that the government is called to account . \nHer son Casey signed up in the final months of the Clinton era , at a time when there seemed to be little possibility of war in foreign fields . \n`` His recruiter told him that even if there was a war , he would never see combat because he had scored so high in the entrance exam - he 'd only be in a support role , '' says Cindy . \n`` He was a good soldier , he liked being in the army . \nHe only went to Iraq because his buddies were going and they all feel a responsibility for each other . '' \nShe has since met many of his fellow soldiers and the sergeant who tried to talk Casey out of going on the mission that killed him . \n`` Casey just said , ` ` Where my chief goes , I go ' , and he left and he was killed . \nI get feedback from the troops all the time and 99.9 % say , ` Keep on doing what you 're doing because it 's a nightmare here and we want to come home and it 's only people like you in the peace movement that give us hope ' . '' \nDuring this trip to Britain , she will address Saturday 's International Peace Conference -LRB- organised by the Stop the War Coalition -RRB- , and will also meet members of the Scottish parliament and fellow activists , including Britons who have lost their sons or brothers in the war . \nThen it will be back to her new home in Berkeley and on with the work for her new book - about how one person can have a political impact by just getting on with it . \nShe is very unimpressed with Bush 's rationale for the war . \n`` He keeps coming up with the same inane speech as though that 's going to rally people back to support him . \nAs for his ` national strategy for victory ' - would n't it have been nice if they had started to plan for that before they invaded in the first place and killed so many brave young Americans like Casey ? \nIt 's gratifying that America is now opening its eyes and I 'm not so wacky and out there by myself any more . \nWe are not the ` extreme ' people any more . \nLook at the polls , George Bush , you 're the one who 's at the extremes . '' \nThe Democrats have also largely been a disappointment , she says , not least Hillary Clinton . \n`` She 's very wishy-washy , she 's playing the middle because she wants to be president and I look at all the politicians who want to be president and they are basically playing the middle , too , '' she says . \n`` It obviously did n't work for John Kerry , and I told him : ` If you had come out strongly against the war and said you would start bringing the troops home , you would have won in a landslide ' . \nBut he has this memory that he did come out strongly against the war ! \nHoward Dean -LRB- the unsuccessful candidate for the Democratic Party nomination -RRB- told me the war is a hard issue . \nNo , it 's not . \nOur kids are there being killed and they 're killing innocent Iraqis for lies . \nIt 's not brain surgery . '' \nCindy 's campaigning work leaves her no time for anything else , she says - something that her other children have had to adjust to . \nThey have been very supportive , though , and recently went to dinner with her and Jane Fonda , another supporter , and Fonda 's daughter . \nJoan Baez has been a frequent and supportive visitor to the camp , as have a surprising array of Republicans , she says . \nShe is not surprised to have been the target of the conservative Fox news channel and others on the right , but is gratified that the mainstream media have given the camp some coverage . \n`` They had been very creative in not covering the anti-war movement up until then . '' \nCindy is 48 , too young to have been involved in the anti-Vietnam war movement . \n`` I remember there was a lot of violence on campuses , which was kind of frightening to me . '' \nShe is hopeful that the current movement will continue beyond the end of the war in Iraq , and she has been in touch with Iraqis who have lost children fighting on the other side . \n`` I do n't blame the people who killed Casey but the people who brought us into this , who lied and deceived the world , '' she says . \n`` But the anti-war movement is growing at all levels . \nCongress is starting to talk about bringing the troops home and you never saw any of that before .

' \nThe disclosures follow rising demands for the government to establish a clearer strategy for bringing troops home following the kidnapping of two British SAS troopers in Basra and the scenes of violence that surrounded their rescue . \nLast week Blair 's own envoy to Iraq , Sir Jeremy Greenstock , warned that Britain could be forced out if Iraq descends so far into chaos that ` we do n't have any reasonable prospect of holding it together ' . \nContinued tension between the Iraqi police force , the Iraqi administration and British troops was revealed again yesterday when an Iraqi magistrate called for the arrest of the two British special forces soldiers . \nwho were on a surveillance mission when they were taken into custody by Iraqi police and allegedly handed on to a militia . \nFor Blair , the question of withdrawal is one of the most difficult he is facing . \nThe Prime Minister has abandoned plans , announced last February , to publish his own exit strategy setting out the milestones which would have to be met before quitting : instead , the plans are now being negotiated between a commission representing the Shia-dominated Iraqi government , and senior US and UK diplomats and military commanders in Baghdad . \nSenior military sources have told The Observer that the document will lay out a point-by-point ` road map ' for military disengagement by multinational forces , the first steps of which could be put in place soon after December 's nationwide elections . \nEach stage of the withdrawal would be locally judged on regional improvements in stability , with units being withdrawn as Iraqi units are deemed capable of taking over . \nOfficials familiar with the negotiations said that conditions for withdrawal would not demand a complete cessation of insurgent violence , or the end of al-Qaeda atrocities . \nAccording to the agreement under negotiation , each phase would be triggered when key security , stability and political targets have been reached . \nThe phased withdrawal strategy - the British side of which is expected to take at least 12 months to complete - would see UK troops hand over command responsibility for security to senior Iraqi officers , while remaining in support as a reserve force . \nIn the second phase British Warriors and other armored vehicles would be removed from daily patrols , before a complete withdrawal of British forces to barracks . \nThe final phase - departure of units - would follow a period of months where Iraqi units had demonstrated their ability to deal with violence in their areas of operation . \nBlair will tackle his critics over Iraq in his conference speech , aides said this weekend , but would decline to give a public deadline for withdrawing troops . \nHe is expected to make several major interventions on the war in the coming weeks , before a vote on the new constitution in mid-October , explaining how Iraq could be steered towards a sufficiently stable situation to allow troops to come home . \n` What we are not going to set out is a timetable : what we are going to set out is a process of developing that security capability , ' said a Downing Street source . \n` We do n't want to be there any longer than we have to be , the Iraqis do n't want us to be there any longer than we have to be , but the Iraqi Prime Minister has made it very clear that our presence there is one that is necessary . ' \nIt was revealed yesterday that an Iraqi judge issued the warrants for the arrest of the two rescued soldiers , accusing them of killing one policeman and wounding another , carrying unlicensed weapons and holding false identification . \nThe continuing preparations for a military withdrawal come , however , as officials are bracing themselves for a new political crisis in Iraq next month , with what many regard as the inevitable rejection of a new constitution by a two-thirds majority in three provinces , sufficient to kill the document and trigger new elections . \nThe same officials believe that a failure of the controversial constitution - which Sunnis say favors the Shia majority - would require at least another year of political negotiations , threatening any plans to disengage . \n"}

' \nUsually dolphins were controlled via signals transmitted through a neck harness . \n` The question is , were these dolphins made secure before Katrina struck ? ' \nThe mystery surfaced when a separate group of dolphins was washed from a commercial oceanarium on the Mississippi coast during Katrina . \nEight were found with the navy 's help , but the dolphins were not returned until US navy scientists had examined them . \nSheridan is convinced the scientists were keen to ensure the dolphins were not the navy 's , understood to be kept in training ponds in a sound in Louisiana , close to Lake Pontchartrain , whose waters devastated New Orleans . \nThe navy launched the classified Cetacean Intelligence Mission in San Diego in 1989 , where dolphins , fitted with harnesses and small electrodes planted under their skin , were taught to patrol and protect Trident submarines in harbor and stationary warships at sea . \nCriticism from animal rights groups ensured the use of dolphins became more secretive . \nBut the project gained impetus after the Yemen terror attack on the USS Cole in 2000 . \nDolphins have also been used to detect mines near an Iraqi port . \n"}
{"id": "57", "time": "2005-11-11", "text": "Judging by Jarhead , Sam Mendes 's film about the first Gulf war , the American war movie is n't growing up much . \nBut it is adapting to the times You can tell Sam Mendes 's Jarhead is self-conscious by the number of nervous references it makes to several of older and better war movies . \nMendes is as slick and meretricious here in Desert Storm as he was in the suburbs of American Beauty and among the reach-me-down neo-noir cliches of Road to Perdition , but I congratulate him for taking on his big-budget predecessors like a new fish in the jailhouse preemptively stomping the wing daddies . \nFirst up is Apocalypse Now , whose Ride of the Valkyries sequence is viewed by a packed audience of ecstatically war-hungry Marines , fresh out of boot camp , all screaming `` Bu - Bu-Buh-Bom-Bom ! '' \nas the rockets fly and the bodies burn . \nWhich , ironists may note , was probably not the effect intended by Francis Ford Coppola , who by many accounts let his own anti-war movie turn him into an on-set General Patton , a man whose biopic he 'd co-written a decade earlier . \nThe Deerhunter , fraudulent then and now , fares worse . \nOne Marine 's wife mails a video copy for him to watch with his platoon , but after the credits - including , cheekily , `` directed by Michael Cimino '' - the footage has been taped over by the grunt 's wife back home with footage of herself getting bonked by the neighbor . \nAfter congress is concluded she gives the lens the finger and dumps her Clean Marine . \nI like to think that 's also Mendes 's rigid digit to Cimino . \nElsewhere , he 's not nearly so clever . \nHis boot camp scenes are pure Full Metal Jacket , and in places the tone veers from M \\* A \\* S \\* H \\* - style service comedy to Catch-22 absurdism , propelled by the sun-dazed musings of sensitive soldier-writer Jake Gyllenhaal , himself a cliche harking back to self-conscious scribbling infantrymen such as James Jones and Norman Mailer . \nJarhead seems unable to decide exactly what kind of war movie it wants to be . \nJudging by Jarhead , the American war movie is n't growing up much , but it is adapting to the times . \nOnce upon a time , back in the Good War and after , it was John Wayne , lock-and-load , no doubts , no blood , and lashings of the Andrews Sisters . \nThen came Vietnam , fought on the myths those earlier movies promulgated , and everything went all `` frag the lieutenant ! '' \n, ears for souvenirs , the smell of napalm in the morning , and nothing but blood and doubt , all pumped up by Creedence and Stax . \nEverything was green and brown , an iconography of jungle and rice paddy , monsoon and mosquitoes . \nOf course , before Americans saw all this in the movies , they had to watch it on the news every night for a decade . \nNo less green and wet were the recent second world war do-over movies like Saving Private Ryan , which let directors shed gallons of plasma that were n't permissible in the 1940s and 50s , and yet wave the flag as if John Wayne was still among us . \nBand of Brothers was broadcast literally on the eve of war , almost as if the Ministry of Truth had willed it : the handiest war-nostalgia boom ever . \nStill , they went easy on the Andrews Sisters , so there was an upside . \nWhich brings us to Jarhead . \nTypically , the first Iraq movie made during the Iraq war proper turns out to be about the other Iraq war , the one that lasted 100 hours and offered no battle time , no money-shot , for most of the troops expecting to fight in it . \nIf Jarhead had any discernible politics , it might give the infinitely savvier Three Kings a run for its money , but no : Mendes seems content to use one Marine 's comment as his own alibi : `` Fuck politics . \nThe rest is bullshit . '' \nThis is a fraudulent disavowal of reality heard pretty much daily from senators and pundits - and , I suspect , from movie execs eyeing potential receipts in the Red States - during our own Iraq war , the one with all the bodies . \nStill , just the accident of its release at this moment almost makes it feel more political than it is . \n"}
{"id": "350", "time": "2005-11-18", "text": "Three searing films about US atrocities in Vietnam are suddenly back in demand . \nJane Fonda relives the role she played in the making of one Fatal immodesty ... Winter Soldier -LRB- left -RRB- and Hearts and Minds When Michael Moore used his Oscar acceptance speech to attack George Bush just days before the outbreak of war in Iraq , it was not the first time the Academy Awards had witnessed a controversial anti-war protest from one of its winners . \nClose to three decades prior , producer Bert Schneider 's outspoken response to receiving an Oscar for the searing Vietnam documentary Hearts and Minds -LRB- 1974 -RRB- so infuriated co-hosts Bob Hope and Frank Sinatra that they immediately cobbled together a disclaimer denying any responsibility for the evening 's `` political references '' . \nThe Bush administration 's failure to pull themselves out of their current military quagmire has apparently sparked renewed interest in the films that documented the conflict in Vietnam . \nHearts and Minds - arguably one of the greatest documentaries ever made , composed largely of interviews with US soldiers and Vietnamese citizens - has been re-released in the UK after revisiting screens in the States . \nLikewise , Winter Soldier -LRB- 1972 -RRB- has hit US cinemas again after more than 30 years . \nBased on the three-day gathering of war veterans in 1971 that I helped fund , it was a film intended to document American war crimes in the conflict . \nA third film , Sir ! \n, details how GIs were converted to leading members of the peace movement and has recently won plaudits at several film festivals . \nWatching Hearts and Minds again after so many years , the parallels between the two conflicts seem quite remarkable . \nThe dubious initial premise for war , the polarised society back home of hawks versus doves , and of course Lyndon B Johnson 's promise that `` the ultimate victory will depend on the hearts and minds of the people who actually live out there '' - from which the film takes its name - all still stick in the throat . \nIt may not have been the first feature film to attack American policy in the conflict -LRB- Emile de Antonio 's In the Year of the Pig arrived in 1968 -RRB- , but it shook the country like no other . \nWhile the film received mixed reviews from critics of the time -LRB- ranging from `` a cinematic lie '' to `` brave and brilliant '' -RRB- , Hearts and Minds succeeded in cementing in the US psyche the horrific image of a naked girl running from a US napalm attack , as well as the point-blank execution of a prisoner by a South Vietnamese official . \nDirector Peter Davis 's film gave a voice to Vietnamese citizens who up until that point had been painted by the national media only in primary colors . \nHe turned the two-dimensional stereotypes into complex human beings - interviewing a coffin-maker about his child-size boxes , an entrepreneur hoping to make a fortune from building a prosthetic limb factory , and showing a grieving family at a funeral - swiftly juxtaposed with a clip of General Westmoreland 's infamous comment that `` the oriental does n't put the same high price on life as does the westerner '' . \nAs well as traumatised veterans , he finds draft-card burners , hundreds on peace marches and a returned navy veteran who , when asked by a child what Vietnam looks like , replies : `` If it was n't for the people , it -LRB- would be -RRB- very pretty . '' \nHowever , it was the focus on the Vietnamese families and the suffering of ordinary individuals that had the biggest effect on Americans in 1974 . \nThis was the year after troops had been officially withdrawn from the country , but still a year before the south fell to the National Liberation Front . \nInflation , unemployment and the Watergate scandal caused Americans to retreat inward in an attempt to forget about the conflict . \nPaul Zimmerman in Newsweek described the film at the time as `` a thoroughly committed , brilliantly executed and profoundly moving document ... Unlike our leaders who encourage us to put Vietnam behind us , Davis wants us to confront our feelings about it first and to understand the experience before we bury it . \nWe turn away from this portrait of ourselves at our peril . '' \nThe life of the film , eventually edited down to 110 minutes from over 200 hours of footage , began smoothly but soon ran into difficulties . \nSchneider 's success with Easy Rider and Five Easy Pieces led to the unusual step of Columbia offering a generous budget with relative freedom - he soon hired Davis , who was at the time receiving critical acclaim for his TV documentary The Selling of the Pentagon . \nHowever , the company executives grew nervous after an early version was screened for Columbia lawyers , and expressed their concerns to Schneider . \nAgainst their wishes , Hearts and Minds was shown at the 1974 Cannes film festival and - just like Moore 's Fahrenheit 9\\/11 , which also had problems with its distributors - received rapturous applause . \nColumbia refused to budge , though , leaving them at a stalemate until Schneider and Davis eventually bought the film from them . \nIt went on to win best documentary feature at the Academy awards , during which Schneider made the controversial decision to read his message of `` greetings of friendship to all American people '' from the Provisional Revolutionary Government delegation to the ongoing peace talks in Paris . \nWinter Soldier was n't quite as successful in its reach . \nThe film documents our attempts during a three-day gathering in Detroit to expose the true nature of our country 's war crimes in Vietnam - known famously as the Winter Soldier investigation . \nIt was shown widely in Europe but , until recently , never found a distributor in the US , partly because the conflict was still ongoing . \nThe name Winter Soldier invoked Tom Paine 's reference to the revolutionary soldiers who , through the terrible winter of 1777-1778 , volunteered to remain at Valley Forge . \nThe idea was for Vietnam veterans to testify about atrocities they had committed or had witnessed while in Vietnam . \nThe motivation for the film was the My Lai massacre . \nWhen the story about My Lai broke in the New York Times in November 1969 , it had staggered the public . \nWhat had enraged a lot of Vietnam veterans , however , was the way the government was scapegoating Lieutenant William Calley and the men he commanded , calling My Lai an `` isolated incident of aberrant behavior '' . \nTo the membership of the Vietnam Veterans Against the War - numbering 25,000 to 30,000 members in 1970-71 - the My Lai massacre was remarkable only in the number of victims involved and the fact that it became public . \nThe vets knew that atrocities were occurring as an inevitable part of our Vietnam policies and that if justice was to be served , the architects of those policies - from the president down - needed to be held accountable . \nPreparing for the Winter Soldier investigation required fast fundraising - and I hit the road running , raising most of the money through a six-week speaking tour that took me to 54 college campuses across the country , and during which police arrested me for `` drug smuggling '' -LRB- vitamins , actually -RRB- . \nOn January 31 1971 , hundreds of people from all over the country crammed into the large conference room in a motel to witness the event . \nThe heart of the Winter Soldier investigation was the testimony from the veterans . \nSitting solemnly in front of microphones at a long table covered by white cloth , they made an unusual sight with their medals , uniforms , long hair , and beards . \nOne by one they said who they were , where they had served , and what category of war crime they would testify about . \nIn voices sometimes choked with emotion , the men told how they and others had randomly killed Vietnamese civilians and tortured Vietnamese prisoners . \nThey told of raping and mutilating women and girls ; cutting off ears and heads ; rounding up entire villages into concentration camps . \nThey told of B-52 carpet-bombing ; throwing Vietcong suspects from helicopters ; using white phosphorous , which burned endlessly though a person 's body . \nOnly this week , the US admitted using the same substance during the assault last year in Fallujah . \nI was numb as I listened to speaker after speaker describe these atrocities . \nI heard what was being said , but I could n't get my heart to grasp it . \nThis was partly to do with my own emotional state . \nMy nerves were shot . \nI could n't sleep . \nPicketers outside the hotel were brandishing signs saying I was a communist . \nMy father was n't speaking to me and , because of the news reports about my arrest , probably thought I was a drug-smuggler . \nMy Hollywood connections feared I 'd never work again . \nA month or so later , sitting in the projection room of Francis Ford Coppola 's Zoetrope offices in San Francisco , watching a rough cut of the documentary with other funders of the film , I finally broke down . \nAnd once the tears came , they were unstoppable . \nUntil then , I had thought that what was important about the Winter Soldier investigation was its indictment of the US government for sending men to fight a war whose very nature made atrocities inevitable . \nBut something far more profound than the question of blame had transpired over those three days in Detroit . \nA spiritual shift had occurred that signalled hope . \nThese men , as they gave witness , were pointing the way for all of us : if they , who had done and seen the unimaginable , could transform themselves by their collective truth telling , then could n't we all ? \nToday , we do those who served in Vietnam a grave disservice to feign outrage at what these men said and did , and to deny that any atrocities were committed by Americans . \nThese ranks of brave men are joined by the subjects of David Zeiger 's welcome new documentary Sir ! \n, which shows how some of the most dedicated troops turned their backs on violence and devoted themselves to the peace movement - from setting up anti-war groups to wearing peace signs instead of dog-tags . \nIt was recently shown at the Lincoln Center in New York and was followed by a dialogue between Vietnam and Iraq veterans - the latter talking about how the film spoke to their feelings about the current situation . \nReading over old reviews of Hearts and Minds , one comment by the New York Times journalist Vincent Canby , written in 1975 , struck me as identifying with acute precision why each of these documentaries is still so vital : `` An interview with Clark Clifford , the former Secretary of Defense , at the beginning of the film sets what I take to be the theme when Mr Clifford recalls the extraordinary economic , military and industrial power the United States found itself with at the end of the second world war . \nThe film goes on to examine the nearly suicidal effects of that power when it was explained , justified , defined and , in particular , when it was wielded as something that had been God-given rather than as something inherited through one of the most marvellous accidents - the unplanned conjunction of people , place and time - in recorded history . \nI do n't think the film means to knock American achievements but only to point out that a certain lack of perspective , of modesty , perhaps , can be close to fatal .

{"id": "18", "time": "2005-11-27", "text": "The leak that revealed Bush 's deep obsession with al-Jazeera The US president planned to bomb the Qatar-based channel - that was the remarkable claim made in a top-secret memo . \nWhy is the world 's most powerful man so worried about a TV station ? \nSunday 27 November 2005 02.10 GMT It was an ambush . \nAs Britain woke up yesterday morning to snowstorms and arctic temperatures , the Attorney General was preparing to be questioned on Radio Four 's Today program over government plans to scrap jury trials in complex fraud cases . \nInstead , as the interview with John Humphrys ground to an end shortly after 8.30 am , the urbane Lord Goldsmith found himself explaining why he had warned national newspapers not to reveal the contents of a top secret memo detailing a lengthy conversation between the Prime Minister and President George Bush over the direction of the war in Iraq . ' \nI was n't seeking to gag newspapers ; what I said to newspapers was you need to take legal advice , ' Goldsmith insisted as an increasingly irritable Humphrys accused him of trying to silence the media for political expediency . \n` It is not being used to save the embarrassment of a politician , ' Goldsmith persevered . \n` That is completely not the case at all . ' \nIt is unlikely this will be the last time Goldsmith will be asked about the memo , which first emerged in the offices of a little known Northamptonshire MP in June last year , and has metamorphosed into a major diplomatic incident . \nThe status of the now infamous five-page document concerning the meeting between Bush and Blair , on 16 April last year , has already reached mythic proportions among bloggers on the internet . \nIt is the smoking gun to end all smoking guns , claim conspiracy theorists , who believe it details everything from an agreed date to pull the troops out , to plans to take the one-time rebel stronghold of Fallujah . \nThe one indisputable fact , though , is that part of the memo - 10 lines to be precise - concerns a conversation between Bush and Blair regarding Al Jazeera , the Arabic satellite television station that the US accuses of being a mouthpiece for al-Qaeda . \nAccording to those familiar with the memo 's contents , Bush floated the idea of bombing the Qatar-based station . \nThe Daily Mirror , which ran the story last Tuesday , claimed the Prime Minister talked Bush out of the plan . \nAs they attempted damage limitation last week , government officials suggested Bush 's comments were nothing more than a joke . \nIt was preposterous to suggest Bush would countenance such an idea , the officials said . \nThe White House described the allegations as ` unfathomable ' although according to those who have seen the memo ` there is no question Bush was serious . ' \nBut whether said in jest or not , the memo reveals Bush 's profound obsession with Al Jazeera , an obsession that stretches from stucco-clad government offices in Washington to the tin huts located behind the razor wire in Guantanamo Bay . \nWhy is the most powerful man in the world worried about a 24-hour news organization ? \nSalah Hassan , an Al Jazeera camerman , was arrested by US forces in November 2003 , while filming the aftermath of an attack on a US convoy near the city of Baquba . \nFollowing his arrest he was surprised to discover he had been trailed by US troops for weeks and had been secretly photographed at the scene of other attacks . \nWhen he was interrogated , he was accused of having prior knowledge of attacks on coalition forces . \nAt the heart of the accusation is the fundamental tension between journalists - largely Arab reporters catering for an Arab audience - who say they are anxious to cover the story from both sides , and a United States that regards reporting on some aspects of the insurgency as tantamount to collaboration with terrorism . \nNone of which would matter much were into not for the ferocious tenacity and professionalism of Al Jazeera , factors which have made the station an international phenomenon . \nMost gallingly for the US , its reporters have told a story that Washington either disagrees with or would rather remain untold : that the kind of war America is prosecuting in Iraq is messy and heavy handed ; that civilians are too often the victims , and that the insurgents are not shadowy sinister figures but ordinary men with more support than politicians would like to acknowledge . \nAs a result Al Jazeera has seen itself under almost constant attack by a White House whose instinct has been to control the media since the war in Afghanistan . \nThe US military has harassed its reporters . \nIts offices in Baghdad and Kabul have both been bombed by the US and reporters have been detained , threatened and abused . \nThe reason , perhaps , is not so difficult to fathom . \nIn the aftermath of the 9\\/11 attacks , the station , which now enjoys a viewership of some 50 million , began broadcasting a series of messages from Osama bin Laden . \nIt was a remarkable scoop , but one for which the station would pay heavy consequences , convincing the US that Al Jazeera was , at the very least , infiltrated by Al Qaeda . \nWas bin Laden using the broadcasts to send secret messages to his followers ? \nBy the April of 2004 - and the first battle of Fallujah - US official loathing of the channel had reached a tipping point . \nIts focus was the figure of Ahmed Mansour , who reported from the city . \nAccording to Sami Muhyideen al-Hajj , an Al Jazeera camerman arrested in Afgahnistan in 2001 and detained in Guantanamo Bay , US interrogators are obsessed with the idea of Al Qaeda infiltration of the channel and asked about Mansour over 100 times . \nOn separate occasions the reporter and producer has been accused of membership of the radical Muslim Brotherhood -LRB- which he denies -RRB- and forming ` improper ' relationships with mujahedeen leaders when he covered the Russian wars in Afghanistan and Chechnya . ' \nI do n't know why they would ask about me over a hundred times , ' Mansour told The Observer last week . \n` But the American authorities did not hide their extreme annoyance and fury as a result of my coverage of the first Fallujah campaign in April of 2004 . \nMy sole crime was broadcasting the reality of a war I was witnessing . ' \nMansour has become something of a cause celebre , lionised almost as much in the West as he is the Middle East . \nAnd the fact remains , despite the plethora of accusations against Al Jazeera by its political enemies , so far only one case of Al Qaeda collaboration has been brought to court - that of Taysir Allouni in Spain . \nA celebrated war correspondent who has interviewed bin Laden , Allouni was jailed for seven years after being cleared of the main charges in a case some claim was more political than evidential . \nIt was a Friday afternoon in early June last year when a five-page document lying in his pigeon-hole in his constituency office caught the attention of Tony Clarke , the then Labor MP for Northampton South . \nIt was immediately clear to him this was no ordinary party political memo . \nAs he began to read the document , it became apparent it contained extraordinary details of a discussion between the British Prime Minister and the US President during Tony Blair 's visit to the White House the previous April . \nWritten by a Blair aide who accompanied the Prime Minister to Washington it was headed ` top secret ' . \nIt is understood that on the five pages there were details of troop deployments and movements . \nLurking within the pages were also frank discussions over the US assault on Fallujah . \nIt was clear from the tone of the memo that Blair was far from happy at the tactics used by American forces . \nThen , within a few short lines , came the bombshell : documentary evidence the US president had openly talked about bombing Al Jazeera . \nClarke , who had voted against military intervention in Iraq believed he had no choice but to call Downing Street and reveal what he had been sent . \nThe next day officers from Special Branch interviewed him at his home . \nClarke 's trusted 42-year-old political researcher , Leo O'Connor , was also questioned . \nDetectives investigating the leak searched Clarke 's offices in the House of Commons . \nIt was not long before they had set their sights on the potential leaker as David Keogh , a 49-year old civil servant who had been seconded from the Foreign Office to the Cabinet Office . \nKeogh lives alone in Northampton , not far from O'Connor , and was a member of the Labor Party and an occasional member of a dining club that Clarke and other senior members of the local Labor Party attended . \nHe was arrested on 1 September last year and 10 days ago was charged with sending the document to O'Connor some time between 16 April and 28 May 2004 in breach of the Official Secrets Act . \nO'Connor , in turn , has been charged with receiving the document under section 5 of the Official Secrets Act . \nDetails of the Foreign Office 's deep misgivings over the way the US was prosecuting the war had already been reported on 23 May last year in the Sunday Times , which had obtained another leaked document . \nBack then there was no desire by the Attorney General to pick a fight with Fleet Street and threaten it with the Official Secrets Act . \nSome suspect the difference this time is down to the fact the Al-Jazeera memo has deeply embarrassed the Bush administration . \nKeogh and O'Connor are due to appear at Bow Street magistrates ' court , south west London , this Tuesday . \nThis initial hearing is likely to be held behind closed doors while the defense and prosecution teams fire their opening salvos . \nCrucial to the case will be whether the judge believes any of the case can be heard in public . \nLegal experts draw comparisons with the case of Katherine Gunn , the former GCHQ employee who alerted the world to the United Nations bugging scandal . \nThe case against Gunn collapsed over fears British intelligence secrets would be revealed in open court and lead to questions over the legality of the war . \nThe conclusion must be the government 's legal advisers believe it wo n't be forced into such a humiliating climbdown when the case goes to court . \nThis time around the government is n't going to blink . \nAn arab rival to the BBC The television station was set up in 1996 with $ 150 million from the Emir of Qatar . \nIt was accused of being al-Qaeda 's mouthpiece when it broadcast a message from Osama bin Laden praising the 9\\/11 hijackers . \nMany Muslim viewers criticise it for being too pro-Western and giving airtime to Israeli officials . \nIt now rivals the BBC , with a worldwide audience of 50 million . \nAn English-language satellite service will launch in March 2006 . \nIn 2004 Index on Censorship praised its ` courage in circumventing censorship and contributing to the free exchange of information in the Arab world ' . \nLike a MacBook Pro '' says @Mister_Solomon : Westminster Dog Show - live ! \n"}

' \nIn a damning and wide-ranging indictment of Iraq 's escalating human rights catastrophe , Allawi accused fellow Shias in the government of being responsible for death squads and secret torture centres . \nThe brutality of elements in the new security forces rivals that of Saddam 's secret police , he said . \nAllawi , who was a strong ally of the US-led coalition forces and was prime minister until this April , made his remarks as further hints emerged yesterday that President George Bush is planning to withdraw up to 40,000 US troops from the country next year , when Iraqi forces will be capable of taking over . \nAllawi 's bleak assessment is likely to undermine any attempt to suggest that conditions in Iraq are markedly improving . \n` We are hearing about secret police , secret bunkers where people are being interrogated , ' he added . ' \nA lot of Iraqis are being tortured or killed in the course of interrogations . \nWe are even witnessing Sharia courts based on Islamic law that are trying people and executing them . ' \nHe said that immediate action was needed to dismantle militias that continue to operate with impunity . \nIf nothing is done , ` the disease infecting -LRB- the Ministry of the Interior -RRB- will become contagious and spread to all ministries and structures of Iraq 's government ' , he said . \nIn a chilling warning to the West over the danger of leaving behind a disintegrating Iraq , Allawi added : ` Iraq is the centrepiece of this region . \nIf things go wrong , neither Europe nor the US will be safe . ' \nHis uncompromising comments came on the eve of Saddam 's latest court appearance on charges of crimes against humanity . \nThey seem certain to fuel the growing sense of crisis over Iraq , both in the country itself and in the US , where political support for the occupation continues to plummet . \nAllawi was selected to serve as prime minister of the first interim government , before last January 's first national elections . \nAdmired in both Downing Street and the White House as a non-sectarian politician committed to strong centralised government representing all Iraqis , Allawi 's supporters struggled in last January 's elections , where they were eclipsed by Shia religious parties , some of which have been implicated in the violence . \nRecently , however , his reputation has enjoyed a resurgence as he has tried to build alliances with Sunni political groups ahead of next month 's national elections . \nHis comments come as a blow to those hoping that Iraq was moving towards normalisation under the new government . \nIn a speech on Wednesday , Bush is expected to hail the improved readiness of Iraqi troops , which he has identified as the key condition for withdrawing US forces . \nBut the proximity of the latest round of elections appears to have only intensified political murders and intimidations , including members of Allawi 's own list , who have been killed and attacked by political rivals . \nDespite denials of wrongdoing by the Ministry of the Interior , which has been implicated in much of the abuse , a series of damaging disclosures , including the discovery of a secret detention center run by the ministry , has heaped embarrassment on the Iraqi government and its foreign supporters . \nThe intervention by one of Iraq 's most prominent political figures promises to turn human rights abuses into a key election issue . \nAllawi 's scathing assessment of the collapse of human rights in Iraq under the country 's first democratically elected government came amid an angry denunciation of the involvement of the Iraq government 's institutions in widespread disappearances , torture and assassinations . \nHe added that he now had so little faith in the rule of law that he had instructed his own bodyguards to fire on any police car that attempted to approach his headquarters without prior notice , following the implication of police units in many of the abuses . \nAllawi saved his strongest condemnation for the Ministry of the Interior , whose personnel have been accused of being behind much of the abuse : ` The Ministry of the Interior is at the heart of the matter . \nI am not blaming the minister -LRB- Bayan Jabr -RRB- himself , but the rank and file are behind the secret dungeons and some of the executions that are taking place . ' \nResponding to the former prime minister 's comments , Sir Menzies Campbell , the Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman , said : ` It is inconceivable in the higher reaches of the command of the multinational forces that there was not an awareness of what is being done by some Iraqis to their own countrymen . \n` The assertions by Mr Allawi simply underline the catastrophic failure to have a proper strategy in place for the post-war period in Iraq .

'' \nThese two extremes , the promethean leap of the Iraqi workers ' movement and the subsequent martyrdom of Fahd , are present in the hope and tragedy of Hadi Saleh 's life and death . \nSaleh was a printer , his professional life brutally interrupted at the age of 20 by the second Ba'ath coup , when he was sentenced to death for independent labor activities , serving five years on death row before his sentence was commuted . \nHe found refuge in Sweden , along with his wife and comrade Korea , with whom he had two children , Furat and Rafid , and where his grandchildren were born . \nThere , he helped establish the underground Workers ' Democratic Trade Union Movement -LRB- WDTUM -RRB- in 1980 . \nKnown as Abu Furat , Saleh was hunted by the regime : at the WDTUM founding conference in Kurdistan , participants wore scarves concealing their identities . \nSaleh opposed President Bush 's war against Iraq . \nHe returned home at considerable personal danger before the collapse of the Saddam Hussein dictatorship and worked tirelessly to end the occupation of his country , by democratic and popular means . \nHe saw independent trade unions in Iraq as essential in this task . \nIn May 2003 , Saleh and others formed the IFTU , which now represents over 200,000 members in the transportation , printing , construction , oil , electricity , railways and food production industries . \nWhen a delegation of British trade unionists visited the IFTU in Baghdad , in October 2003 , Saleh told us : `` Saddam Hussein tried for 35 years to suppress trade unions ; he turned his ` yellow unions ' into instruments of repression and violence against workers . \nAfter the fall of the regime , both nationalist and democratic political traditions within trade unionism have tried to re-establish new trade unions based on democratic principles - not based on one political ideology . '' \nA small-framed , dapper man with an intense gaze and an air of surprising calm , Saleh lived and breathed the history of the workers ' movement , recalling with pride that : `` The printing union in Iraq is considered one of the oldest . \nHistorically , its members fought bitter struggles for the right to form their own union , a union that could defend their rights . '' \nIn January last year , Saleh visited London , outlining the problems facing Iraqi trade unionists , including the upholding under occupation of Ba'athist - era anti-union laws and attacks by US forces on IFTU offices . \nHe told us : `` There is a dire need to organise democratic structures . \nWe need new progressive laws that recognize and guarantee workers ' rights , and trade unions need to be involved in the formulation of any new labor laws . '' \nIn December , Saleh attended the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions congress in Miyazaki , Japan . \nHis gentleness , charm and commitment to democratic , independent workers ' organization impressed all who met him . \nInterviewed about the risks in being a trade unionist , he admitted : `` Yes , it 's -LRB- a risk for -RRB- civil society organizations , including trade unions . \nExtremists who targeted those trade unionists , both teachers and engineers , killed them under the notion that they are collaborating with a state created by the Americans , so by definition those are collaborators and legitimate targets . \nWe call on our brothers and sisters in the international community to support us to make sure that our rights in organising formal unions freely and openly are guaranteed and ensured . '' \nSaleh was murdered after being tortured by a gang who broke into his Baghdad home . \nHis IFTU comrades described the killing as bearing all the hallmarks of the former security services . \nHis union files and membership records were ransacked . \nWhen the history of Iraq 's labor movement is written , Hadi Saleh 's role will be prominent . \nThose of us who believe in his values must stand in solidarity with his fellow Iraqi trade unionists . \nHadi Saleh understood that in Iraq , civil society institutions , particularly trade unions , are the key to preventing a repeat of the past . \nThat is why he gave his life to the cause of the workers ' movement . \nWith the murder of Hadi Saleh , Iraqi working people have lost a courageous trade union leader who dedicated three decades of his life to fighting Saddam Hussein 's dictatorship , to workers ' rights and to the cause of a free , prosperous , democratic and federal Iraq . \nHis murder is an attack on the right of Iraqi workers to trade union representation . \nIt is aimed at destabilising and undermining the development of trade unions as cornerstones of development and respect for human rights in post-Saddam Iraq . \nIn May 2003 , Hadi was instrumental with the WDTUM in organising an open trade union foundation meeting in Baghdad , which led to the formation of the IFTU . \nHe was a key political figure , providing mature analysis , an unshakeablebelief in democratic trade union values and boundless energy . \nHadi Saleh 's commitment to trade unionism was a vital feature of his vision for a democratic , peaceful and federal Iraq , which would unite all Iraqis , regardless of their background , ethnicity or religion . \nFor him , trade unions would be the key to achieving such unity . \nThus he championed workers ' rights to organise and to strike to achieve decent jobs , pay and working conditions : the basic building blocks of strong , non-sectarian trade unionism . \nSuch a strategy remains the only way to defeat the IMF shock therapy and trans-national economic occupation , which has been imposed undemocratically on Iraqis by the occupying powers . \nHowever , his commitment to independent trade unionism was also linked to his determination to end the occupation of our country and to rebuild civil society . \nThe IFTU points out that his murder forms part of a continuing program of intimidation against workers and trade unionists . \nHadi 's IFTU comrades have been heartened in their grief by the response of the international labor movement , the ILO and peace movements across the world to demands that Iraq 's interim government provide adequate protection for workers and their trade union representatives as they carry out their jobs . \nHadi Saleh , trade unionist and communist , born 1949 ; died January 4 2005 . \n"}

'' \nAnother of the organisers , Doug Miller , president of the polling firm GlobeScan , said he had been monitoring trends since the start of 2003 and the figure for those who disagreed that the US was having a mainly positive impact on the world had risen from 46 % then to 49 % last year , and had now jumped to 58 % . \n`` Our research makes very clear that the re-election of President Bush has further isolated America from the world , '' he said . \n`` It also supports the view of some Americans that unless his administration changes its approach to world affairs in its second term , it will continue to erode America 's good name , and hence its ability to effectively influence world affairs . '' \nAsked how Mr Bush 's re-election had affected their feelings towards Americans , 72 % of those polled in Turkey said it made them feel worse about Americans , 65 % in France , 59 % in Brazil and 56 % in Germany . \nThere was also overwhelming opposition to sending troops to Iraq , even among close allies such as Britain . \n`` Fully one in four British citizens say the Bush re-election has made them more opposed to sending troops to Iraq , resulting in a total of 63 % now opposed , '' Mr Miller said . \nThe poll was conducted between November 15 and January 3 in Argentina , Australia , Brazil , Canada , Chile , China , France , Germany , India , Indonesia , Italy , Japan , Lebanon , Mexico , Philippines , Poland , Russia , South Africa , South Korea , Turkey and the UK . \nA separate poll , for the Los Angeles Times , shows Americans are also polarised over the prospect of a second term , including over the conduct of the war in Iraq . \nMr Bush 's job approval rating stands at 50 % , with 47 % disapproving . \nIn recent times , only Richard Nixon at the start of his second term in 1972 recorded poll ratings as poor . \n"}

'' \nThis was , he explained , aimed mostly at Blair for having lied . \nHe was n't challenged . \nIt was beyond argument . \nDennis , I 'd guess , had never been challenged . \nNot by the researcher , the producer , the editor , his pals , not by anyone . \nLike a lot of middle-class anti-Blairites , I do n't think he had ever heard the contrary case put . \nDuring the election people wrote to this newspaper saying that they had n't met a single person who was voting Labor . \nAnd it does n't matter what is proved to have happened . \nThe attorney general 's advice ? \nNever mind what they actually say - that intelligence did judge that Saddam possessed WMDs , that the attorney general did advise that the war was probably legal - the cartoonists tell you that Blair is a liar , the comedians tell you that Blair is a liar , so he 's a liar . \nSometimes this predetermination becomes bizarre . \nLet me take one example , where I could take thousands . \nThese are the words used by writer Richard Gott to describe Blair during this election campaign . \n`` An arrogant and God-fuelled appeaser '' , and `` a war criminal who should be locked up behind bars without a vote '' . \nAnd this is Gott on Iraqi leaders in mid-2002 . \n`` Saddam has had a violent past '' , but `` is not a charismatic leader '' , partly because he uses `` unconvincing rhetoric '' and is `` incompetent at getting his message across '' . \nProblems are caused by his `` lack of sophistication and the secretive nature of his regime '' . \nFortunately , however , his deputy , Tariq Aziz - Yuletide host of the new MP for Bethnal Green and Bow - is `` an intelligent , articulate and persuasive politician '' . \nGott , on a journey to Baghdad , notices that the many pictures of Saddam are not defaced at all . \nIs it , he asks , `` terror , or apathy , or a cultural reluctance to disturb something associated with the state ? \nIt is difficult to say , but of overt signs of opposition to the regime , there are none . '' \nOh , I 'd say it was down to cultural reluctance , would n't you ? \nIf they 'd only been a little bit more uninhibited , those Kurds and Shias would happily have taken their magic markers to the odd Saddam statue , Mukhabarat or no Mukhabharat . \nGott is , of course , a slightly extreme example . \nBut it seems to me that mild forms of Gottism are to be found all over the place . \nI know where I 'd have advised readers to put them . \nThe Hornsey and Cambridge effects , where Liberal Democrats overturned hefty Labor majorities ? \nWith the honorable exception of immigration , a protest vote for the Lib Dems was a vote to say one was on the left while paying nothing for the privilege . \nAnd it was also a vote for the utterly immoral proposition that , having sent our troops to topple Saddam , we should pull them out no matter what the Iraqi government asked us to do . \nAnd now we have ancient `` left '' hits revisited , with Frank Dobson , Glenda Jackson and others inviting other Labor party members to join them in a chorus of that 80s press favorite , `` Is this the way to Armageddon ? '' \nYou want to know the two reasons she gives for joining the Tories ? \nThe `` disastrous escapades '' of the imposition of student top-up fees and the war in Iraq . \nOh , the unbelievable irony of it ! \nIt is for none of these reasons that this is my last column for G2 . \nI 'll not be here for the format change , which I know will be fantastic . \nHowever , with writers such as Emma Brockes , Laura Barton , Lucy Mangan and Hadley Freeman , not to mention the comic talent of Tanya Gold , you wo n't miss me . \nI will , however , miss some of you . \n"}

'' \nAll this seems innocent fun , but patriotic myths have sharp edges . \nThe `` good war '' against Hitler has underwritten 60 years of warmaking . \nIt has become an ethical blank cheque for British and US power . \nWe claim the right to bomb , to maim , to imprison without trial on the basis of direct and implicit appeals to the war against fascism . \nWhen we fall out with such tyrant friends as Noriega , Milosevic or Saddam we rebrand them as `` Hitler '' . \nIn the `` good war '' against them , all bad things become forgettable `` collateral damage '' . \nThe devastation of civilian targets in Serbia or Iraq , torture at Abu Ghraib and Guantnamo , the war crime of collective punishment in Falluja , fade to oblivion as the `` price of democracy '' . \nOur democratic imperialism prefers to forget that fascism had important Anglo-American roots . \nHitler 's dream was inspired , in part , by the British Empire . \nIn eastern Europe , the Nazis hoped to make their America and Australia , where ethnic cleansing and slave labor created a frontier for settlement . \nIn western Europe , they sought their India from which revenues , labor and soldiers might be extracted . \nAmerican imperialism in Latin America gave explicit precedents for Germany 's and Japan 's claims of supremacy in their neighbouring regions . \nThe British and Americans were key theorists of eugenics and had made racial segregation respectable . \nThe concentration camp was a British invention , and in Iraq and Afghanistan the British were the first to use air power to repress partisan resistance . \nThe Luftwaffe - in its assault on Guernica , and later London and Coventry - paid homage to Bomber Harris 's terror bombing of the Kurds in the 1920s . \nWe forget , too , that British and US elites gave aid to the fascists . \nPresident Bush 's grandfather , prosecuted for `` trading with the enemy '' in 1942 , was one of many powerful Anglo-Americans who liked Mussolini and Hitler and did what they could to help . \nAppeasement as a state policy was only the tip of an iceberg of practical aid to these dictatorships . \nCapital and technology flowed freely , and fascist despots received dignified treatment in Washington and London . \nHenry Ford made Hitler birthday gifts of 50,000 marks . \nWe least like to remember that our side also committed war crimes in the 1940s . \nThe destruction of Dresden , a city filled with women , children , the elderly and the wounded , and with no military significance , is only the best known of the atrocities committed by our bombers against civilian populations . \nWe know about the notorious Japanese abuse of prisoners of war , but do not remember the torture and murder of captured Japanese . \nEdgar Jones , an `` embedded '' Pacific war correspondent , wrote in 1946 : '' ` We shot prisoners in cold blood , wiped out hospitals , strafed lifeboats , killed or mistreated enemy civilians , finished off the enemy wounded , tossed the dying into a hole with the dead , and in the Pacific boiled flesh off enemy skulls to make table ornaments . '' \nAfter 1945 , we borrowed many fascist methods . \nNuremberg only punished a handful of the guilty ; most walked free with our help . \nIn 1946 , Project Paperclip secretly brought more than 1,000 Nazi scientists to the US . \nAmong their ranks were Kurt Blome , who had tested nerve gas at Auschwitz , and Konrad Schaeffer , who forced salt into victims at Dachau . \nOther experiments at mind control via drugs and surgery were folded into the CIA 's Project Bluebird . \nJapan 's Dr Shiro Ishii , who had experimented with prisoners in Manchuria , came to Maryland to advise on bio-weapons . \nWithin a decade of British troops liberating Belsen , they were running their own concentration camps in Kenya to crush the Mau Mau . \nThe Gestapo 's torture techniques were borrowed by the French in Algeria , and then disseminated by the Americans to Latin American dictatorships in the 60s and 70s . \nWe see their extension today in the American camps in Cuba and Diego Garcia . \nWar has a brutalising momentum . \nThis is the moral of Taken By Force , which shows how American soldiers became increasingly indiscriminate in their sexual violence and military authorities increasingly lax in its prosecution . \nEven as we remember the evils of nazism , and the courage of those who defeated it , we should begin to remember the second world war with less self - satisfaction . \nWe might , in particular , learn to distrust those who use it to justify contemporary warmongering . \nRichard Drayton is senior lecturer in history at Cambridge University . \nAfter reports that unarmed drones might be deployed to search for self-proclaimed killer Christopher Dorner near Los Angeles , should law enforcement agencies use armed drones against an ` imminent threat ' on US soil ? \n"}

MGA 's research findings also cast doubt on the wisdom of publishers paying inflated licensing fees to secure movie-related brands . \nOf the 47 games that charted during the 12-month period , just two - Digital Bridges ' The Fast And The Furious and Jamdat 's Lord Of The Rings : Return Of The King - were based on movies , and both spent just a single month on the chart . \nMeanwhile , the success rate of console brands was patchy . \nSome console brands , such as Digital Bridges ' FIFA Football and Tiger Woods 2004 , and Gameloft 's Splinter Cell : Pandora Tomorrow performed well , but others - including Wonderphone 's Crash Nitro Kart and Sorrent 's DRIV3R - spent just a single month on the chart . \n`` The poor performance of movie-related brands and some of the console ports indicates that games companies can no longer afford to rely on brands alone to achieve sustainable sales , '' says Pamela Clark-Dickson , editor of MOBILE GAMES ANALYST . \n`` Investment in the development of original IP will likely accelerate in the short-to-medium term , particularly with the increased commitment to mobile of video-games publisher Electronic Arts , which has already stated its intention to create original mobile games . '' \nOkay , so the most successful downloads included Pac-Man and Tetris , but right up there was Pub Pool , a great little pool sim blatantly not based on a movie , TV show or current console brand . \nOf course , there 's every possibility that , when the big videogame publishers realize they ca n't get away with lazy conversions , they 'll just abandon the mobile platform altogether , scratching their heads in bemusement . \nLet 's hope , instead , that they set up dedicated development teams -LRB- hey , we 're talking six people at the most -RRB- and start really investigating what people want from mobile games . \nOr more pertinently , how to get more people to want mobile games . \nBecause shoving some lobotomised mini conversion onto the platform and hoping the kids are dumb enough to download it is clearly NOT WORKING . \nHere is the proof . \nRead it and weep . \nAnd when you 've finished weeping , start writing some decent games . \nPosted by Keith Stuart at 06:33 PM | Comments -LRB- 0 -RRB- | Permalink Keith - I know you love your mobile games , but to me they 've always been little more than a mindless distraction between real games -LRB- i.e. PC\\/console -RRB- . \nBut a little lookie at some of I-Play 's games has changed my mind a little . \nNate Adams Freestyle Motocross , which reminded me of 80s budget stormer Kickstart , had a impressive physics engine which gave a subtlety more usually associated with console games . \nJewel Quest was an addictive version of the casual gaming webgame , but the most enjoyable and instant hit was Skipping Stones - a one button treat that will be good fun on the tube . \nDo n't ditch the DS or PSP just yet , but clearly there is some interesting mobile stuff out there . \nPosted by Greg Howson at 01:12 PM | Comments -LRB- 10 -RRB- | Permalink Motorola has announced that it is launching a mobile multiplayer games service via its HelloMoto portal . \nOwners of Motorola handsets will be able to download games then play them against other phone users in different countries and on various networks - the site is also set to support leagues , tournaments and in-game chat . \nMotorola has elected to use Terraplay 's mobile multiplayer gaming infrastructure - the same system 3 is using for it 's 3G multiplayer titles . \n`` Motorola believes immersive human-to human-applications will be key drivers for growth in the mobile industry and we are very pleased to be offering such exciting multiplayer games to our customers . \nAs part of our ` Innovate ' program we are always looking for the very best technologies , such as Terraplay , to support the considerable capabilities of our handsets , and in addition drive additional revenues for our operator customers .

Yes , Iomo 's funny and pretty daft pub sim is now available for download from all the usual sources . \nYou play as Terry the landlord fighting off four generations of lager louts , including gangsters , hippies and break dancers . \nIt 's not a beat 'em up really , more a rhythm action game based around casual alcohol-fuelled violence . \nThere 's a different setting for each decade - the seventies is set in a pub toilet and each bout starts with you at the urinal . \nYour character zips up , turns round and starts kicking disco dancers . \nThat , to the best of my knowledge , never happened in Street Fighter . \nJust released by Elkware this is , as the title cunningly suggests , a 3D golf sim . \nThe visuals look quite nice , and there are weather effects and customisable characters . \nAnother new release , this is a very polished , very playable 2D pool sim from Gameloft . \nThe single player mode has a kind of Hustler feel - it 's all based in a smokey pool hall , and you have to gamble cash on each match . \nYou also get extra money for pulling off special shots , which is quite a good idea . \nThe press release they sent me proudly boasts ` with Lynyd Skynyrd 's Sweet Home Alabama , Midnight Pool is the first mobile game featuring licensed music !

'' \nMr Galloway has denied allegations that he profited from Iraqi oil sales and will come face to face with the committee in what promises to be one of the most highly charged pieces of political theater seen in Washington for some time . \nYesterday 's report makes two principal allegations against the Bush administration . \nFirstly , it found the US treasury failed to take action against a Texas oil company , Bayoil , which facilitated payment of `` at least $ 37m in illegal surcharges to the Hussein regime '' . \nThe surcharges were a violation of the UN Oil For Food program , by which Iraq was allowed to sell heavily discounted oil to raise money for food and humanitarian supplies . \nHowever , Saddam was allowed to choose which companies were given the highly lucrative oil contracts . \nBetween September 2000 and September 2002 -LRB- when the practice was stopped -RRB- the regime demanded kickbacks of 10 to 30 US cents a barrel in return for oil allocations . \nIn its second main finding , the report said the US military and the state department gave a tacit green light for shipments of nearly 8m barrels of oil bought by Jordan , a vital American ally , entirely outside the UN-monitored Oil For Food system . \nJordan was permitted to buy some oil directly under strict conditions but these purchases appeared to be under the counter . \nThe report details a series of efforts by UN monitors to obtain information about Bayoil 's oil shipments in 2001 and 2002 , and the lack of help provided by the US treasury . \nAfter repeated requests over eight months from the UN and the US state department , the treasury 's office of foreign as sets control wrote to Bayoil in May 2002 , requesting a report on its transactions but did not `` request specific information by UN or direct Bayoil to answer the UN 's questions '' . \nBayoil 's owner , David Chalmers , has been charged over the company 's activities . \nHis lawyer Catherine Recker told the Washington Post : `` Bayoil and David Chalmers -LRB- said -RRB- they have done nothing illegal and will vigorously defend these reckless accusations . '' \nThe Jordanian oil purchases were shipped in the weeks before the war , out of the Iraqi port of Khor al-Amaya , which was operating without UN approval or surveillance . \nInvestigators found correspondence showing that Odin Marine Inc , the US company chartering the seven huge tankers which picked up the oil at Khor al-Amaya , repeatedly sought and received approval from US military and civilian officials that the ships would not be confiscated by US Navy vessels in the Maritime Interdiction Force -LRB- MIF -RRB- enforcing the embargo . \nOdin was reassured by a state department official that the US `` was aware of the shipments and has determined not to take action '' . \nThe company 's vice president , David Young , told investigators that a US naval officer at MIF told him that he `` had no objections '' to the shipments . \n`` He said that he was sorry he could not say anything more . \nI told him I completely understood and did not expect him to say anything more , '' Mr Young said . \nAn executive at Odin Maritime confirmed the senate account of the oil shipments as `` correct '' but declined to comment further . \nIt was not clear last night whether the Democratic report would be accepted by Republicans on the Senate investigations committee . \nThe Pentagon declined to comment . \nThe US representative 's office at the UN referred inquiries to the state department , which fail to return calls . \n"}

'' \nMr Galloway 's testimony rested on two key points : that the documents naming him in the senate report were the same documents the Daily Telegraph had relied upon in a story he later successfully sued over , and that the subcommittee had no evidence he had made the financial gains from Iraqi oil that it alleged . \n`` What counts is not the names on the paper . \nWhat counts is where 's the money , senator ? \nWho paid me money , senator ? \nWho paid me hundreds of thousands of dollars ? \n`` The answer to that is nobody - and if you had anybody who paid me a penny , you would have produced them here today . '' \nThe senate report claimed Mr Galloway and Charles Pasqua , the former French interior minister , were given potentially lucrative oil allocations as a reward for their support in calling for sanctions against Saddam Hussein 's regime to be loosened . \nMr Pasqua also denies the claims . \nMr Galloway told the senators they had made a `` schoolboy howler '' in dating their evidence against him to almost a decade earlier than the Daily Telegraph and a period from 1992-93 when the UN oil for food program - the center of the investigation - was not even in existence . \nThe MP , elected to parliament on May 5 on an anti-war ticket in the former seat of Oona King , a Tony Blair loyalist , said the Christian Science Monitor , which used documents from the same period had retracted its story and admitted the documents were fake . \n`` It is a proven fact these forged documents existed and were being circulated among rightwing newspapers , '' Mr Galloway told Sen Coleman . \n`` You have nothing on me , senator , except my name on lists of names from Iraq , many of which have been drawn up after the installation of your puppet government in Baghdad , '' he said . \nOne of the main allegations in the senate report is that Mr Galloway received oil allocations with the help of Fawaz Zureikat , a Jordanian businessman and chairman of the Mariam appeal set up by the MP to help a 4-year-old Iraqi girl with leukemia . \nThe allegations of oil trading links between the two men - denied by both parties - formed the bulk of the questioning of Mr Galloway after he had finished his opening statement . \nHe told the senators : `` I can assure you Mr Zureikat never gave me a penny from an oil deal , a cake deal , a bread deal or from any other deal . '' \nWhen not defending himself against the senate report 's allegations , Mr Galloway attacked the morality of the post-Gulf war sanctions on Iraq and the wisdom of the 2003 US-led invasion . \nHe described the sub-committee 's claims as the `` mother of all smokescreens '' , intended to divert attention from the `` crimes '' committed in the invasion of Iraq . \n`` Senator , in everything I said about Iraq I turned out to be right and you turned out to be wrong - and 100,000 have paid with their lives , 1,600 of them American soldiers sent to their deaths on a pack of lies , '' Mr Galloway told Sen Coleman . \nHe insisted he had been a longer-standing opponent of Saddam Hussein than anyone questioning him . \n`` I was an opponent of Saddam Hussein when the British and American governments and businessmen were selling him guns and gas , '' he told the subcommittee . \n`` I have a better record of opposition to Saddam Hussein than you do .

{"id": "126", "time": "2005-06-30", "text": "Doubts cast on success of speech in halting slide against conflict Thursday 30 June 2005 03.14 BST Leading Democrats yesterday reacted angrily to President George Bush 's address to the nation , accusing him of `` exploiting the sacred ground '' of September 11 by attempting to link the Iraq war with the terrorist attacks . \nIn his prime-time speech at Fort Bragg military base , the president mentioned September 11 five times in 30 minutes as he argued that withdrawal from Iraq would leave the US open to more terrorist attacks . \nThe twitchy mood in Washington was underscored yesterday when the White House was briefly evacuated - and Mr Bush moved to a safe location - in the latest aviation alert to hit the capital . \nThe all-clear was rapidly sounded when the airspace rogue proved to be an innocuous private aircraft . \nInstant polls after Mr Bush 's speech suggested that he might have solidified support among the largely Republican audience who watched the performance , but it was unclear whether he had made headway against a steadily advancing tide of scepticism about the justification for the war . \nDemocrats argued that he had offered no new ideas on how to beat the insurgency . \nThey pointed to the administration 's lack of credibility over Iraq in the wake of post-war inquiries that found no weapons of mass destruction and no substantive prewar links between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaida . \nNancy Pelosi , the minority leader in the House of Representatives , said Mr Bush was trying to `` exploit the sacred ground of 9\\/11 , knowing that there is no connection between 9\\/11 and the war in Iraq '' . \nIn his speech , Mr Bush did not repeat his administration 's prewar claims of a direct Iraqi role in the September 11 attacks . \nInstead , he suggested that the insurgents shared a common `` totalitarian ideology '' with al-Qaida , and that if they were not defeated in Iraq they could use the country as a base from which to launch terrorist attacks on the US homeland . \nSenator John Kerry , Mr Bush 's opponent in last November 's election , said the speech represented the administration 's third rationale for the 2003 invasion . \n`` The first , of course , was weapons of mass destruction . \nThe second was democracy , and now , tonight , it 's to combat the hotbed of terrorism , '' he told CNN . \n`` But most Americans are aware that the hotbed of terrorism never existed in Iraq until we got there . '' \nSenator Joseph Biden , the Democrats ' leading voice on foreign policy , predicted that the martial rhetoric would not rescue the president 's standing in the polls , where Mr Bush has lower ratings than presidents Reagan or Clinton at this stage of their second terms . \n`` I think the American people are a lot smarter than that , '' he said . \nHowever , Andrew Kohut , head of the Pew Research Centre , a Washington polling organization , said the broader ties outlined by the president might strike a chord with the public . \n`` For many Americans the premise for the war was that Saddam Hussein was a dangerous man and we are better off without him , '' he said . \n`` It was not so much premised on a direct link between Saddam and al-Qaida , as on the suggestion that we face a threat from that part of the world and if we leave a mess it will be a danger to us . '' \nThough one poll showed that the speech drew the smallest audience of any Bush presidential appearance , another poll by Gallup found that it may have served its purpose in bolstering the resolve of viewers , at least temporarily . \nOf an estimated 23 million who watched , 54 % thought the US was winning the war , compared with 44 % before the speech . \nBut only 23 % were registered Democrats - and the boost the president received was weak compared with the upsurge following similar set-piece speeches in the past . \nThe address was also savaged abroad . \nA Labor MP , Lynne Jones , said any attempt to suggest that it was a response to the September 11 attacks was `` absolute nonsense '' . \n`` What they have ensured , in invading Iraq , is they have actually promoted al-Qaida 's involvement in other countries , including Iraq .

{"id": "56", "time": "2005-01-27", "text": "Arab leaders watch in fear as Shia emancipation draws near Thursday 27 January 2005 00.02 GMT For the first time in centuries , Shias are about to come into their own as the rulers - or at least the politically dominant community - in a key Arab country . \nIn principle , the Iraqi elections will ratify and lend constitutional legitimacy to a transformation inexorably under way since the fall of Saddam Hussein . \nIn the Arab world , except for Lebanon with its largely Christian population , the rulers of all 22 states have traditionally hailed from the orthodox Sunni majority . \nBut until now that has included two countries , Iraq and Bahrain , where , against the broader trend , Shias compose the majority . \nThe correction of this anomaly will be momentous , given Iraq 's history and geopolitical weight , and the tumultuous conditions in which it is taking place . \nIraq , after all , is where , in the bloody struggle over the prophet 's succession , Islam 's great schism first took root ; where , for centuries , Shias under Sunni Ottoman rule bore the brunt of its conflicts with Shia Persian empires ; where , in the 1920s , Shias led the rebellion against British mandatory rule , but ended up grossly underrepresented in the modern Iraqi state ; where , under Ba'athism , Sunnis turned minority rule into despotism of the most chauvinistic and brutal kind . \nThe idea of electorally established Shia dominance of Iraq deeply troubles Arab regimes , with or without Shias of their own . \nJordan 's King Abdullah has most publicly declared what others keep to themselves . \nFor him the great peril is Iran , the world 's only -LRB- apart from Azerbaijan -RRB- Shia-majority state that is also Shia-ruled - and clerically , militantly ruled to boot . \nIran 's `` vested interest '' , he says , is `` to have an Islamic republic of Iraq ; if that happened , we 've opened ourselves to a whole set of new problems that wo n't be limited to the borders of Iraq '' . \nHe warned of a Shia `` crescent '' stretching from Iran into Iraq , Syria and Lebanon , destabilising Gulf countries and posing a challenge to the US . \n`` This is the first time , '' said the Lebanese commentator Joseph Samaha , `` an Arab official has used such crude , direct and dangerous language to publicly incite against a particular confession and warn that it may turn into a fifth column to be used against the majority . '' \nFor other Arab commentators , what such remarks indicate , at bottom , is fear of democracy , and the prospect that Iraq will now demonstrate what Palestine already has - that in the Arab world people have more electoral choice if they are occupied rather than sovereign . \n`` They are terrified , '' said Salama Ne ` mat , `` lest elections prove contagious and spread to Iraq 's neighbouring states and peoples . \n`` The danger to certain Arab governments is the democratic ` weapon of mass destruction ' that could destroy the structure of tyranny and backwardness that weighs heavily upon the chests of their peoples . '' \nAny Iraqi democracy is bound , at first , to assume the `` sectarian '' character King Abdullah deplores . \nThe ruthless , discriminatory exploitation of sectarianism that was the foundation of Saddam 's rule has to give way to a system whose primary building block is the fair and representative stake which the country 's various communities acquire in it , the Shias acquiring the largest . \nInevitably , too , Iran , for which the emancipation of its Iraqi co-religionists is a great potential enhancement of its own regional influence , is Iraq 's only neighbor to be happy about that . \nIronically , it was much quicker than Arab friends of America to `` recognize '' the new American-installed Iraqi order and is the most ardent supporter of American-sponsored elections . \nArab regimes with Shia citizens , especially in the Gulf , perhaps have most grounds for alarm , because , like Saddam , they have in varying degrees discriminated against them . \nThe quest for equal rights has been common to Shias in every modern Arab state . \nThe only one in which they have basically achieved them , through civil war as well as that country 's unique , confessionally organised political system , is Lebanon . \n`` Iraq could represent a democratic model for the Arab-Muslim world which has experienced futile and utopian conflicts for 14 centuries , '' said Sheikh Ali Salman , a Shia leader in Bahrain . \nThough Shias constitute 60 % of Bahrain 's population , they do not apparently aim for an Iraq-style change of regime , only for greater representation than they have achieved so far . \nBut Iraqi Shia emancipation is also disturbing to a non-Shia country such as Jordan , because , small and fragile , it is deeply affected by any political upheavals in neighbors more powerful than itself , and its relatively benign autocracy does depend on discrimination of a kind , favoring Transjordanians over Palestinians . \nIn multi-confessional Syria , minority Alawites dominate the regime ; Shia triumph in Iraq might encourage the majority Sunnis to regain the ascendancy which - the opposite of their co-religionists in Iraq - they lost with the rise of Ba'athism . \nIt is obvious that all these regimes , like the Iraq insurgents themselves , hanker after a restoration of the old Sunni - or Ba'athist - dominated order , or even some Saddam-like figure to preside over it - or , at least , as King Abdullah once put it , `` somebody with a military background who has experience of being a tough guy '' . \nEqually obviously , however , the Shias , recalling what happened in the 20s , will not have it . \nSo , like the Americans , the regimes have now calculated that , while holding elections , which a large part of the Sunni community might boycott , is a grave risk , not holding them would be a graver one . \nThey are all - even Syria the US accuses of abetting the insurgency - urging the Sunnis to lend their vital sanction to the kind of popular consultation they would never permit in their own countries . \nFor what makes Arab regimes fear an Iraqi democracy makes them fear civil war more ; and while quite possible with elections , that would be even more so without them . \nThe Shias have so far been remarkably restrained in their response to the anti-Shia terror that seems to be a secondary part of the Sunni resistance to American occupation ; their mainstream religious leaders clearly want to keep their distance from Iran , and , according to a recent opinion poll , Sunnis are twice as much in favor of a fully fledged `` Islamic government '' of some kind as they are . \nBut , if they can not come into their inheritance by constitutional means , they will be all too likely drawn into unconstitutional , violent means instead . \nAnd Iran would get deeply involved in that . \n"}

' '' \nAnd , 40-odd pages later : `` I heard a reporter say to Donald Rumsfeld : ` Before the war in Iraq , you ... said they would welcome us with open arms . ' \nAnd I heard Rumsfeld interrupt him : ` Never said that . \nYou may remember it well , but you 're thinking of somebody else . \nYou ca n't find , anywhere , me saying anything like those things you just said I said . ' '' \nEliot Weinberger is a poet , essayist and translator -LRB- most notably of Octavio Paz -RRB- . \nI have often thought that your best bet , if you need intelligent , lapidary prose in a hurry , is to ask a poet to do it , even , or rather particularly , if it 's about politics . \n-LRB- Admittedly , this was not such a sure-fire proposal in the second world war . \nThink of Ezra Pound . -RRB- \nIn 9\\/12 , a meditation on the consequences of the World Trade Centre atrocity , Weinberger had already proved himself the master of the provoking juxtaposition : `` We are bombing Afghanistan because it is believed that the terrorists who attacked the Trade Centre and the Pentagon were housed and trained for their mission in Afghanistan . \nThere is , as yet , no evidence for this assertion . \nWhat has been proven , however , is that the terrorists were housed and trained for their mission in Florida . '' \nThere is little , if any , such humor in What I Heard About Iraq . \nWe know more about the number of people who have died , and about the conduct of the war , and it 's not funny . \n-LRB- From the top-secret minutes of the prime minister 's meeting on July 23 2002 : Blair was told that `` military action was now seen as inevitable . \nBush wanted to remove Saddam , through military action , justified by the conjunction of terrorism and WMD . \nBut the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy ... There was little discussion in Washington of the aftermath . '' \nBut we all kind of knew that all along , did n't we ? -RRB- \nBut this is a very necessary book , for it presents an almost irrefutable case against the war . \nThere are many people - I have , from time to time , been one of them - who , when hearing outraged conversation about the subject in our bien-pensant , brie-munching liberal circles , have preferred to go all quiet . \nAfter all , as PG Wodehouse said , if not about Saddam , `` slice him where you like , a hellhound is always a hellhound '' ; and there are a lot of people who are n't going to be tortured to death by his goons any more . \n-LRB- Which is why the last paragraph , depicting Saddam writing poetry , reading the Koran and placing a circle of white stones around a plum tree , is as grotesque and revolting as a photo of him in his underwear . \nIt is the book 's only lapse of judgment . -RRB- \nBut the folly , mendacity and vicious stupidity of the war is brought chillingly home throughout . \nThe paragraphs are arranged so as to present a chronological version of what we have heard about the war . \nThe rise of the reported death counts , civil and military , is particularly appalling . \nThe book , understandably if frustratingly , is free of notes citing sources , but these would have marred its elegance ; and besides , we 've heard most of this stuff ourselves . \nMoreover , the `` I heard ... '' approach parodies the whole process of sexed-up rumor which supposedly justified the business in the first place . \nIt is very one-sided . \nA pro-war writer could produce a mirror image - but I suspect it would be harder . \n"}

'' \nThe Sun 's front page , headlined Tyrant 's in His Pants , showed Saddam , dressed only in baggy white Y-fronts . \nOther grainy pictures inside showed him sleeping and sitting in a red plastic chair washing his trousers . \nThe newspaper claimed the pictures were taken at the `` top secret location '' in Iraq where the former dictator is being held while awaiting trial for genocide . \nIt said Saddam was constantly monitored by three CCTV cameras to make sure he does not commit suicide . \nIt is unclear whether the pictures were taken from that footage . \nThe New York Post , which like the Sun is owned by Rupert Murdoch , also ran the pictures in later editions under the headline Butcher of Sagdad . \nThe Sun refused to say how it got hold of the pictures , insisting it needed to protect its sources . \nIt also took the unusual step of writing to rival news organizations saying they owned the worldwide syndication rights . \nNews International , the company that owns the newspaper , is said to be demanding # 20,000 a photo . \nIt is thought the military has been able to date the pictures because Saddam began growing a beard about 12 months ago . \nIn the pictures he is clean-shaven . \nIn its story the Sun cited military sources saying they handed over the pictures showing Saddam as `` an ageing and humble old man '' in the hope of dealing a blow to the resistance in Iraq . \n`` It 's important that the people of Iraq see him like that to destroy the myth , '' the paper 's source was quoted as saying . \nBut Lieutenant Colonel Steven Boylan , a senior US army public affairs officer in Baghdad , told the Guardian : `` The photographs were definitely not released by multinational forces in Iraq .

'' \nTariq was frightened about our trip , even though he is from Falluja and we had permission from one group of fighters to enter under their protection . \nBut Tariq , more than anyone , understands that the fighters are no longer just one group . \nHe is quite a character , Tariq : 32 and an engineer with a masters degree in embryo implantation , he works now at a human rights institute called the Democratic Studies Institute for Human Rights and Democracy in Baghdad . \nHe is also deeply into animal rights . \nFoolishly , I took a pill to try to keep down the flu , which made me sleepy . \nIt was 9am when we crossed the main southern gate out of Baghdad , taking care to stay well clear of American convoys . \nThe southern gate is the scene of daily attacks on the Americans by the insurgents - either a car-bomb or an ambush with rocket-propelled grenades . \nIt took just 20 minutes from Baghdad to reach the area known as the `` triangle of death '' , where the kidnapped British contractor Kenneth Bigley was held and finally beheaded in the town of Latifya . \nIt is supposed to be a US military-controlled zone , but insurgents set up checkpoints here . \nAs the road became more rural and more isolated , I got nervous that at any moment we would be stopped by carjackers and robbed of our expensive equipment . \nAt a checkpoint a hooded face came to the window ; he was carrying an old AK47 on his shoulder and looking for a donation towards the jihad . \nThere were six fighters in total , all hooded . \nThe driver and Tariq both made a donation ; I was frightened he would search the car and find the camera , so I gave him my Iraqi doctor 's ID card , hoping that would work . \nHe apologised and asked that we excuse him . \nNow , there was nothing ahead but the sky and the desert . \nIt was 1.30 pm and a bad time to use this road ; we had been told that carjackers were particularly active at this time of day . \nTariq pointed out four young men dressed in red , their two motorbikes parked by the side of the road . \nThey were planting a small , improvised explosive device made out of a tin of cooking oil for the next American convoy to leave the base outside Falluja . \nIt was 3.30 pm before we got to Habbanya , a tourist resort on a lake supplied with fresh water by the Euphrates , which was once controlled by Uday , Saddam 's oldest son . \nIt was here that Fallujans , who used to be wealthy as they supplied a lot of the top military for Saddam 's army , came for holidays . \nNow the place was freezing , and full of refugees . \nAll the holiday houses were crammed with people , sometimes two families to a room . \nThe first family we came across had been there since a month before the attack started . \nA man called Abu Rabe'e came up . \nHe was 59 and used to be a builder ; he said he had a message for our camera . \n`` We 're not looking for this sort of democracy , this attacking of the city and the people with planes and tanks and Humvees . '' \nHe had also fled Falluja with his family . \nThey were all living in a former mechanic 's garage in Habbanya . \nMost of the people we spoke to in Habbanya were poor and uneducated , and had fled Falluja in anticipation of the US attack . \nSome were in tents ; others were sharing the old honeymoon suites where newlyweds used to come when this was a holiday resort . \nThey squabbled among themselves to persuade me to film the conditions they were living in . \nThere was still a fairground in Habbanya , but nothing was working . \nIn the middle of the bumper cars an old lady had pitched a tent with bricks , where she was living with her son . \nI tried to talk to her but she told me to go away . \nThere was no cooking gas in Habbanya , so the Fallujan refugees were cutting down trees to keep warm and cook food . \nThen someone came up and said the resistance fighters had heard we were asking questions . \nWe decided to put the camera away and go to a friendly village that our driver knew . \nIt was also filled with refugees from Falluja . \nOne 50-year-old man , a major in the Iraqi Republican Guards under the former regime , took us in . \nThere were four families squeezed into one apartment , all of them once wealthy . \nThe major , like the others , was sacked after the liberation when the US disbanded the army and police . \nNow jobless , his house in Falluja was wrecked and he was a refugee with his five children and wife near the town where he used to spend his holidays . \nHe was angry with the Americans , but also with the Iraqi rebels , whom he blamed , alongside the clerics in the mosques , for causing Falluja to be wrecked . \n`` The mujahideen and the clerics are responsible for the destruction that happened to our city ; no one will forgive them for that , '' he said with bitterness . \n`` Why are you blaming them - why do n't you blame the Americans and Allawi ? '' \nsaid Omar , the owner of the apartment . \n`` We told the mujahideen to leave it to us ordinary Fallujans , but those bloody bastards , the sheikhs and the clerics , are busy painting some bloody mad picture of heaven and martyrs and the victory of the mujahideen , '' said Ali , another refugee . \n`` And , of course , the kids believe every word those clerics say . \nThey 're young and naive , and they forget that this is a war against the might of the machine of the American army . \nSo they let those kids die like this and our city gets blown up with the wind . '' \nI wanted to ask the tough old Republican guard why they had let these young muj have the run of the city , but I actually did n't have to . \nI remember being in Falluja just before the fighting started and seeing a crowd gathered around a sack that was leaking blood . \nA piece of white A4 paper was stuck on to the sack , which read : `` Here is the body of the traitor . \nHe has confessed to acting as a spotter for American planes and was paid $ 100 a day . '' \nAt the same time as we were standing looking at the sack , I knew I would be able to buy a CD of the man in this sack making his confession before he was beheaded in any CD shop in Falluja . \nThese were the people who controlled Falluja now - not old majors from Saddam 's army . \nIn the morning we went back towards Falluja and heard that there were queues of people waiting to try to get back into the city . \nThe government had made an announcement saying that the people from some districts could start to go back home ; they promised compensation . \nAbout midday we got a mile east of the city and saw that four queues had formed near the American base . \nThey were mostly men , waiting for US military ID to allow them back home . \nThe men were angry : `` This is a humiliation . \nI say no more than that . \nThese IDs are to make us bow Fallujan heads in shame , '' one of them said . \nI met Major Paul Hackett , a marine officer in the Falluja liaison base . \nHe said that the US military was not trying to humiliate anyone , but that the IDs were necessary for security . \n`` I mean , my understanding is that ultimately they can hang this ID card on a wall and keep it as a souvenir , '' he said . \nThey took prints of all my fingers , two pictures of my face in profile , and then photographed my iris . \nI was now eligible to go into Falluja , just like any other Fallujan . \nBut it was late by then , somewhere near 5pm -LRB- the curfew is at 6pm -RRB- . \nAfter that anyone who moves inside the city will be shot on sight by the US military . \nTomorrow , we would try again to get into the city . \nAt around 8am , Tariq and I drove towards Falluja . \nWe did n't believe that we might actually get into the city . \nThe American soldiers at the checkpoint were nervous . \nThe approach to the checkpoint was covered in pebbles so we had to drive very slowly . \nThe soldiers spent 20 minutes searching my car , then they bodysearched Tariq and me . \nThey gave me a yellow tape to put on to the windscreen of the car , showing I had been searched and was a contractor . \nIf I did n't have this stripe of yellow , a US sniper would shoot me as an enemy car . \nBy 10am we were inside the city . \nIt was completely devastated , destruction everywhere . \nIt looked like a city of ghosts . \nFalluja used to be a modern city ; now there was nothing . \nWe spent the day going through the rubble that had been the center of the city ; I did n't see a single building that was functioning . \nThe Americans had put a white tape across the roads to stop people wandering into areas that they still were n't allowed to enter . \nI remembered the market from before the war , when you could n't walk through it because of the crowds . \nNow all the shops were marked with a cross , meaning that they had been searched and secured by the US military . \nBut the bodies , some of them civilians and some of them insurgents , were still rotting inside . \nThere were dead dogs everywhere in this area , lying in the middle of the streets . \nReports of rabies in Falluja had reached Baghdad , but I needed to find a doctor . \nFallujans are suspicious of outsiders , so I found it surprising when Nihida Kadhim , a housewife , beckoned me into her home . \nShe had just arrived back in the city to check out her house ; the government had told the people three days earlier that they should start going home . \nShe called me into her living room . \nOn her mirror she pointed to a message that had been written in her lipstick . \nShe could n't read English . \nIt said : `` Fuck Iraq and every Iraqi in it ! '' \n`` They are insulting me , are n't they ? '' \nI left her and walked towards the cemetery . \nI noticed the dead dogs again . \nI had been told in Baghdad by a friend of mine , Dr Marwan Elawi , that the Baghdad Hospital for Infectious Diseases admits one case of rabies every week . \nThe problem is that infected dogs are eating the corpses and spreading the disease . \nAs I was walking by the cemetery , I caught the smell of death coming from one of the houses . \nThe door was open and the first thing I saw was a white car parked in the driveway and on top of it a launcher for an RPG . \nI went inside , and the sound of the rain on the roof and the darkness inside made me very afraid . \nThe door was open , all the windows were broken and there were bullet holes running down the hall to a bathroom at the end - as if the bullets were chasing something or somebody . \nThe bathroom led on to a bedroom and I stepped inside and saw the body of a fighter . \nThe leg was missing , the hand was missing and the furniture in the house had been destroyed . \nI could n't breathe with the smell . \nI realized that Tariq was n't with me , and I panicked and ran . \nAs I got out of the house I saw a white teddy bear lying in the rain , and a green boobytrap bomb . \nSome of the worst fighting took place here in the center of the city , but there was no sign of the 1,200 to 1,600 fighters the Americans said they had killed . \nI had heard that there was a graveyard for the fighters somewhere in the city but people said that most of them had withdrawn from the city after the first week of fighting . \nI needed to find one of the insurgents to tell me the real story of what had happened in the city . \nThe Americans had said that there had been a big military victory , but I could n't understand where all the fighters were buried . \nAfter I saw the body I felt uncomfortable about sleeping in Falluja . \nThe place was deserted and polluted with death and all kinds of weapons . \nImagine sleeping in a place where any of the surrounding houses might have one , two or three bodies . \nWe went back to my friend the old Republican guard officer . \nI was so tired I could hardly take my clothes off to go to sleep but I could n't sleep with the smell of death on my clothes . \nIn the morning , I went back to find the cemetery and look for evidence of the fighters who had been killed . \nIt was about 4pm before I got inside the martyrs ' cemetery ; people kept waylaying me , wanting to show me their destroyed houses and asking why the journalists did n't come and show what the Americans had done to Falluja . \nThey were also angry at the interim President Allawi for sending in the mainly Shia National Guard to help the Americans . \nAt the entrance to the fighters ' graveyard a sign read : `` This cemetery is being given by the people of Falluja to the heroic martyrs of the battle against the Americans and to the martyrs of the jihadi operations against the Americans , assigned and approved by the Mujahideen Shura council in Falluja . '' \nAs I went into the graveyard , the bodies of two young men were arriving . \nThe faces were rotting . \nThe ambulance driver lifted the bones of one of the hands ; the skin had rotted away . \n`` God is the greatest . \nWhat kind of times are we living through that we are holding the bones and hands of our brothers ? '' \nThen he began cursing the National Guard , calling them even worse things than the Americans : `` Those bastards , those sons of dogs . '' \nIt was n't the first time I had heard this . \nIt was the National Guard the Americans used to search the houses ; they were seen by the Fallujans as brutal stooges . \nMost of the volunteers for the National Guard are poor Shias from the south . \nThey are jobless and desperate enough to volunteer for a job that makes them assassination targets . \n`` National infidels '' , they were also called . \nI counted the graves : there were 74 . \nThe two young men made it 76 . \nThe names on the headstones were written in chalk and some had been washed away . \nOne read : `` Here lies the heroic Tunisian martyr who died '' , but I did n't see any other evidence of the hundreds of foreign fighters that the US had said were using Falluja as their headquarters . \nPeople told me there were some Yemenis and Saudis , some volunteers from Tunisia and Egypt , but most of the fighters were Fallujan . \nThe US military say they have hundreds of bodies frozen in a potato chip factory 5km south of the city , but nobody has been allowed to go there in the past two months , including the Red Crescent . \nSalman Hashim was crying beside the grave of his son , who had been a fighter in Falluja . \n`` He is 18 years old . \nHe wanted to be a doctor or engineer after this year ; it was his last year in high school . '' \nAt the same grave , the boy 's mother was crying and remembering her dead son , who was called Ahmed . \n`` I blame Ayad Allawi . \nIf I could I would cut his throat into pieces . '' \nThen , to the mound of earth covering her son 's body , she said : `` I told you those fighters would get you killed . '' \nThe boy 's father told her to be quiet in front of the camera . \nOn the next grave was written the name of a woman called Harbyah . \nShe had refused to leave the city for the camps with her family . \nOne of her relatives was standing by her grave . \nHe said that he found her dead in her bed with at least 20 bullets in her body . \nI saw other rotting bodies that showed no signs of being fighters . \nIn one house in the market there were four bodies inside the guest room . \nOne of the bodies had its chest and part of its stomach opened , as if the dogs had been eating it . \nThe wrists were missing , the flesh of the arm was missing , and parts of the legs . \nI tried to figure out who these four men were . \nIt was obvious which houses the fighters were in : they were totally destroyed . \nBut in this house there were no bullets in the walls , just four dead men lying curled up beside each other , with bullet holes in the mosquito nets that covered the windows . \nIt seemed to me as if they had been asleep and were shot through the windows . \nIt is the young men of the family who are usually given the job of staying behind to guard the house . \nThis is the way in Iraq - we never leave the house empty . \nThe four men were sleeping the way we sleep when we have guests - we roll out the best carpet in the guest room and the men lie down beside each other . \n`` Its Abu Faris 's house . \nI think that the fat dead body belongs to his son , Faris , '' said Abu Salah , whose chip shop was also destroyed in the bombing . \nIt was getting dark and it was time to go , but I needed some overview shots of the city . \nThere was a half-built tower , so I climbed it and looked around . \nI could n't see a single building that had n't been hit . \nAfter a few minutes I got the sense that this was n't a good place for me to be hanging around , but I had to pee urgently . \nI found a place on the roof of the building . \nWhile I was doing that a warning shot passed so close to my head that I ducked and did n't even wait to pull up my zip , but ran to the half-destroyed stairs to climb down the building . \nI felt as if the American sniper was playing with me ; he had had plenty of time to kill me if he wanted to . \nFor the rest of the day people were pulling on me to come and see their houses . \nAgain , they asked where all the journalists were . \nWhy were they not coming to report on what has happened in Falluja ? \nBut I have worked with journalists for 18 months and I knew it would be too dangerous for them to come to the city , that they are seen as spies and could end up in a sack . \nSo since I was the only one there with a camera , everyone wanted to show me what happened to their house . \nBack in Baghdad that night , I changed my clothes and decided to send them to the public laundry . \nI was worried about contaminating my family with Falluja . \nI was thinking that nobody was going to be able to live there for months . \nThen , I took a very long bath . \nI woke up at home in Baghdad around 9am . \nI had had enough of Falluja , but I still felt that I did n't understand what had happened . \nThe city was completely devastated - but where were the bodies of all the dead fighters the Americans had killed ? \nI wanted to ask Dr Adnan Chaichan about the wounded . \nI found him at the main hospital in Falluja at midday . \nHe told me that all the doctors and medical staff were locked into the hospital at the beginning of the attack and not allowed out to treat anyone . \nThe Iraqi National Guard , acting under US orders , had tied him and all the other doctors up inside the main hospital . \nThe US had surrounded the hospital , while the National Guard had seized all their mobile phones and satellite phones , and left them with no way of communicating with the outside world . \nChaichan seemed angrier with the National Guards than with anyone else . \nHe said that the phone lines inside the town were working , so wounded people in Falluja were calling the hospital and crying , and he was trying to give instructions over the phone to the local clinics and the mosques on how to treat the wounds . \nBut nobody could get to the main hospital where all the supplies were and people were bleeding to death in the city . \nIt was late afternoon when I drove out of Falluja and back to Baghdad , feeling that I had just scratched the surface of what really happened there . \nBut it is clear that by completely destroying this Sunni city , with the help of a mostly Shia National Guard , the US military has fanned the seeds of a civil war that is definitely coming . \nIf there are elections now and the Shia win , that war is certain . \nThe people I spoke to had no plans to vote . \nNo one I met in those five days had a ballot paper . \nA week after I arrived in London to make the film for Channel 4 News , the tape of the final interview arrived by Federal Express . \nIt was the interview with Alzaim Abu , who had led the fighters in the Shuhada district of Falluja and fought the Americans in the early battles in the city center . \nWe had been been trying to track him down for nearly three weeks . \nThen Tariq had got a call from him the night I had left for London saying that he would talk . \nThere was a lot of bullshit in the interview ; lots of bravado about how many Americans they had killed and about never surrendering and how Fallujans would win . \nHe said that there were a few foreign fighters in the city , but none in his units ; mostly , they were Fallujans . \nBut one thing stood out for me that explained the empty graveyard and the lack of bodies . \nHe said that most of the fighters had been given orders to abandon the city by November 17 , nine days after the assault began . \n`` The withdrawal of the fighters was carried out following an order by our senior leadership . \nWe did not pull out because we did not want to fight . \nWe needed to regroup ; it was a tactical move . \nThe fighters decided to redeploy to Amiriya and some went to Abu Ghraib , '' he said . \nThe US military destroyed Falluja , but simply spread the fighters out around the country . \nThey also increased the chance of civil war in Iraq by using their new national guard of Shias to suppress Sunnis . \nOnce , when a foreign journalist , an Irish guy , asked me whether I was Shia or Sunni - the way the Irish do because they have that thing about the IRA - I said I was Sushi . \nMy father is Sunni and my mother is Shia . \nI never cared about these things . \nNow , after Falluja , it matters . \n"}
{"id": "263", "time": "2005-01-16", "text": "How Condoleezza Rice became the most powerful woman in the world As Condoleezza Rice prepares to take over the US State Department from Colin Powell , Paul Harris investigates the girl from Alabama who has risen to become the Bush family 's ultimate insider Condoleeza Rics puts a high price on loyalty , but the most valuable is certainly her own . \nHer unwavering devotion to President George W Bush will reap its most glittering reward this week when she takes over the State Department , becoming the most powerful black American woman in history and the world 's best-known diplomat . \nHer rise to the top is a remarkable story of superhuman tenacity and single-mindedness . \nAt its heart lies an unshakeable belief in her own ability to succeed and a ruthless dedication to advancing herself . \nIt is a story of a life that began in the Deep South of a segregated America and has now reached the innermost sanctums of White House politics . \nBut it is a story that is only just beginning . \nFor Rice 's latest assignment is fraught with danger . \nShe is tasked with bringing the State Department firmly in hand , stifling the barely concealed dissent that marked the tenure of Colin Powell . \nIt will not be easy and is likely to spark the most fierce bout of Washington infighting in years . \nBut for Bush the job is vital . \nThe State Department must be brought to heel . \nIt is Rice 's job to win that battle for her boss . \n` Can Rice transform the State Department into an obedient tool of the administration ? \nThat is the only question in town , ' said Larry Haas , a Washington commentator and former official in the Bill Clinton White House . \nIf she does , the Bush administration will at last be a united and monolithic bloc . \nThe last whiff of internal dissent will have been snuffed out . \nRice is in the fight of her life . \nAt the same time , Rice is inheriting a complex brief that spans a troubled world . \nThe meat grinder of the Iraq war is an ever-present factor . \nWithin days of her taking over the job , Iraqis will go the polls in what will either be a vindication of America 's decision to invade or a blood-soaked disaster . \nThe threat of Iran and North Korea looms . \nRelations with the United Nations and ` Old Europe ' are tattered and torn . \nNot that Rice is nervous . \nShe has been keeping two offices in recent weeks . \nOne is deep in the heart of the White House , the other a ` transition office ' on the first floor of the State Department a short stroll away on Washington 's C Street . \nBut , starting this week , she will be in ` transition ' no more . \nFriends who met her last week say she is relaxed and affable . \nHer familiar calm demeanor is unruffled by troubles ahead . \n` She was excited , but was the same old person . \nShe was relaxed and happy and had a lot of time to chat , ' one friend said . \nThat is the Condoleezza Rice way . \nShe is like a swan on a lake . \nAll poise and grace on the surface , but beneath the water Rice paddles furiously , ruthlessly carving out a place at Bush 's right hand . \nBut who is Condoleezza Rice ? \nWhen she sits down this week before the Senate for the confirmation hearings that will clear her for the job , the panel of aged politicians will see an enigma . \nShe has risen to the highest ranks of Washington by being the ultimate insider who has the ear of Bush like no other power player in the capital . \nYet Rice has remained firmly outside the whirl of Washington life . \nShe lives alone and rarely , if ever , socialises on the ` circuit ' . \nShe comes from a tradition of academic study rooted in Ivy League universities , yet is a key part of an administration which has openly disdained such elites . \nShe is central to one of the most radical Republican governments in recent American history , yet many liberals like her . ' \nI am a flaming liberal , ' laughed one of her friends , ` but she is so bright and intelligent . \nI just think her views are not really represented in this administration . ' \nThat is debatable to say the least . \nRice is undoubtedly deeply conservative , but part of her genius is in persuading many liberals that she secretly might be one of them . \nRice is also a black American , yet race is rarely if ever mentioned when discussing her rise to power . \nIn a race-obsessed society , that is an enigma . \nPerhaps the secret lies in her childhood in the segregated Deep South of Alabama when her home town of Birmingham was marred by racial violence and dubbed ` Bombingham ' . \nFor Rice 's family did not embrace the civil rights movement in the way many other Southern blacks did . \nThey came from a different tradition which held that simple hard work , discipline and education would bring the American Dream to black America . \nHer family was solidly middle class , with a father who worked as a school guidance counsellor and part-time minister and a mother who was a teacher . \nShe was raised intensely as an only child of a couple who came to parenthood late . \nA young Rice performed in church , took piano lessons , learned to play the flute , spoke fluent French and skipped two grades in school . \nHer parents stressed advancement through achievement , not through fighting any racial injustice . \nDespite everything , it would be wrong to say that Rice has little awareness of racial politics . \n` She has no time for black people who are constantly talking about race , but that does not mean she has removed all consciousness of her race , ' said Nicholas Lemann , a writer who has interviewed Rice several times . \nSeveral anecdotes exemplify Rice 's attitude to her race and also her ferocity when attacked . \nShe famously told one interviewer : ` Let me explain to you : I speak French , I play Bach , I 'm better in your culture than you are . ' \nOn another occasion , when Rice was an academic at Stanford , she was shopping for expensive jewellery with a friend when a white clerk made some hostile comments . \n` Let 's get one thing straight , ' Rice reportedly told him . \n` You 're behind the counter because you have to work for six dollars an hour . \nI 'm on this side asking to see the good jewellery because I make considerably more . ' \nRice was a stellar performer at high school , helped by iron discipline that saw her ignore any idea of rebellion or slacking off . \n` If she had children , they would call her ma'am and salute . \nShe has a quasi-military approach , ' Lemann said . \nShe was certainly a young woman in a hurry to achieve . \nHer family moved to Denver when she was a teenager and she enrolled at the local university at 15 . \nIt was there she gave up dreams of becoming a concert pianist and discovered a new passion : international relations . \nThat in turn led to an academic career , specialising in the Soviet Union , that eventually brought her into contact with politics and the Bush family . \nWhen Bush appointed her as his National Security Adviser she was already familiar to him from stays at the Bush family compound in Kennebunkport , Maine . \nFrom there it has been her incredibly close relationship to Bush that has defined her continued rise . \nShe is the paragon of discretion and quiet service to her President . \n` There is little daylight between Rice and Bush . \nIt is hard to think of anyone closer to him , ' said Shaun Bowler , a political scientist at the Riverside Campus of the University of California . \nLike Bush , Rice was all transformed by the experience of 11 September , 2001 . \nThat day wiped out any remnant of the ` Old School ' Rice who had spent years steeped in academia and the Cold War . \n` Before 9\\/11 Rice probably would have been many diplomats ' dream of a Secretary of State , ' said Lemann . \n` After 9\\/11 she was transformed into someone tackling a very new world . ' \nLoyalty is now probably what best describes the secret of Rice 's success . \nNot for her the almost public spats with Donald Rumsfeld that marred Powell 's term of office . \nNot for her the secret briefings to the press or the thinly veiled attacks on her colleagues . \nBut also not for her the terrible isolation that Powell suffered . \nWhen it comes to the real decisions over the next four years , Rice will be at the heart of it all . \nShe will bring the ideology of the White House right into the State Department . \nThat is why she was appointed . \n` Appointing Rice is bringing the White House into State , not bringing State into the White House , ' said Bowler . \nThat will antagonise many of the Powellite ` Old Guard ' in the State Department , who long for a world before the war on terror , the invasion of Iraq and the dawn of the neocons . \nIt is up to Rice to steamroller that opposition and make her department an effective tool of pushing the Bush doctrine around the world . \n` She has a huge job ahead of her , ' said Haas . \n` State usually has a severe reluctance to ruffle feathers across the globe - but this is clearly a feather-ruffling administration . ' \nSo far , however , Rice 's first moves have struck a note of caution . \nHer appointment of the pragmatic Robert Zoellick as her deputy is a traditional move , especially as it passed over the ambitions of the hawkish John Bolton , who would have been the favorite choice of the neocons . \nSurprisingly , Rice has few critics in the American political spectrum . \nPossibly that is because of her achievements , but also perhaps because few people want to be seen to be attacking such a high-profile black woman . \nOne critic , however , is Mel Goodman , a former top CIA analyst and author of the book Bush League Diplomacy , which attacks neoconservative foreign policy . \nGoodman said Rice had been a failure at the National Security Council because she was taken by surprise by 11 September . \n` She failed in her job at the NSC . \nIt is the story that people refuse to tell , ' he said . \nIn a sign that Rice may be headed for troubled waters , Washington insiders are waiting with bated breath for a book by former CIA director George Tenet , who resigned last year as the agency imploded over the scandal of pre-war intelligence on Iraq . \nGoodman said that an initial synopsis of the book indicated who would be firmly in its sights : ` Tenet 's going to go after Condie Rice . ' \nOne thing is certain . \nThrough all the troubled times ahead , Rice will always appear calm . \nShe has good reason to feel safe and secure for she has the unquestioned support of the only man who matters : Bush . \nWhen last year she referred to Bush as ` my husband ' it was a Freudian slip that reflected how close Rice and the Bush clan have become . \nWhen it comes to Rice , the little girl from Birmingham who now bestrides the world stage , she really is part of the family . \nI find football so interesting strategically . \nIt 's the closest thing to war . \nWhat you are doing is taking and yielding territory and have certain strategies and tactics . \nMy parents had me absolutely convinced that you may not be able to have a hamburger at Woolworth 's , but you can be President of the United States . \nThere can not be an absence of moral content in American foreign policy . \nEuropeans giggle at this and say we are naive , but we are not European , we are American and we have different principles . \nYou were told in segregated Birmingham that if you ran twice as hard , you might get half as far . \nAnd there were also people willing to run four times as hard so they could stay abreast . \nAnd once in a while , somebody was willing to run eight times as hard so they could get ahead . \n"}

'' \nThe failure to challenge the administration before and after the Iraq war does not reflect well on the mainstream US media , which badly needs a few more Seymour Hershes to keep the spirit of Watergate reporting alive . \n"}

{"id": "207", "time": "2005-09-15", "text": "George Galloway , the British MP and anti-war campaigner , was labeled a `` disgrace '' last night by pro-war journalist Christopher Hitchens , who was himself branded by Mr Galloway as a `` slug '' leaving a `` trail of slime '' . \nThe two rhetorical heavyweights clashed in a rousing debate on Iraq in New York , both landing painful political blows among the insults , although Mr Galloway , Respect MP for Bethnal Green and Bow , came unstuck when he referred to the September 11 attacks . \nMr Hitchens , the British Vanity Fair columnist who has strayed from his left-wing roots , began by imagining what would have happened had the policies of the `` so-called anti-war movement '' been followed over the last 15 years . \n`` Saddam Hussein would be the owner and occupier of Kuwait . \nHe would have succeeded in the annexation - not merely the invasion - but the abolition of an Arab and Muslim state that was a member of the Arab League and of the United Nations . \nAnd with these resources , as we now know , because he lost that war , he was attempting to equip himself with the most terrifying arsenal that it was possible for him to ... '' Mr Hitchens was unable to finish as a comment from Mr Galloway drowned him out . \nMr Hitchens gave short shrift to the incident on which Mr Galloway 's reputation principally rests in the US , his famous - or infamous - visit to the US Senate this May , during which he put the anti-war case with a forceful , and , for US politicians , somewhat unaccustomed , lack of deference . \n`` It is a disgrace that a member of the British House of Commons should go before the United States Senate sub-committee and not testify , but decline to testify , and to insult all those who tried to ask him questions with the most violent , cheap , guttersnipe abuse . \nI think that 's a disgrace , '' Mr Hitchens said , to cheers from the 1,000-strong crowd . \nMr Galloway used colorful language of his own . \nTo laughter and applause , he brought up Mr Hitchens 's support for the 1991 Gulf war , noting : `` What you have witnessed since then is something unique in natural history : the first ever metamorphosis from a butterfly back into a slug . \nI mention ` slug ' purposefully , because the one thing a slug does leave behind it is a trial of slime . '' \nBut Hitchens claimed that he had simply changed his mind . \n`` I might not have been invited here in this battle of the titans if it was n't tolerably well known that I think I was probably mistaken on that occasion . '' \nAnd he took issue with Mr Galloway 's anti-war credentials . \n`` To hear him speak you would think - would you not ? \n- that he was a pacifist , that he defines himself as anti-war . \nNow how can this be said in good conscience by someone who has just , standing by the side of the dictator of Syria on the 30th of July , referred to the 154 heroic operations conducted in Iraq by the so-called resistance ? '' \nMr Galloway 's comments following his visit to Syria were among his most controversial . \nHe told al-Jazeera : `` The Iraqi resistance is not just defending Iraq . \nThey are defending all the Arabs and they are defending all the people of the world from American hegemony . '' \nHe added , speaking to Arab News Broadcasting : `` Most of the operations which they carry out are against the occupying forces and their collaborators and this is normal in every liberation struggle . '' \nAnd he told Syrian television : `` Two of your beautiful daughters are in the hands of foreigners : Jerusalem and Baghdad . \nThe foreigners are doing to your daughters as they will . \nThe daughters are crying for help and the Arab world is silent . \nSome of them are collaborating with the rape of these two beautiful Arab daughters . \nBecause they are too weak and too corrupt to do anything about it . '' \nMr Galloway stirred the crowd when he brought up the case of Cindy Sheehan , the anti-war protestor whose son died in Iraq last year and who has become the focus of fierce debate in the US . \nRepeating Mr Hitchens ' scathing criticisms of Ms Sheehan , Mr Galloway said : `` You are covered in the stuff you like to smear onto others . \nNot just me ... but people much more gentle than me , people like Cindy Sheehan ... who gave the life of her son for the war that you have come here to glory in . '' \nReferring again to the Syria episode , Mr Hitchens asked : `` Is it not rather revolting to appear in Damascus by the side of -LRB- Bashar al - -RRB- Assad -LRB- the Syrian president -RRB- and to praise the people who killed Casey Sheehan , and then to come to America and appeal to the emotions of his mother ? '' \nBut Mr Galloway hit the wrong note with his comments on September 11 . \n`` You may think that those aeroplanes in this city on 9\\/11 came out of a clear , blue sky . \nI believe they emerged out of a swamp of hatred created by us . '' \nA crescendo of booing cut him off as he continued to speak , and Mr Hitchens commented : `` Mr Galloway , you picked the wrong city to say that in , and arguably the wrong month , as well . '' \nAfter the debate , Mr Galloway told Radio 4 's James Naughtie : `` I think it 's amazing that so many people came and so many people were turned away , so much interest in two British guys debating Iraq in New York . \nThere do n't appear to be figures in the American anti-war movement and in the American pro-war movement that are able to draw an audience , so maybe we 'll have to take this show to the west coast , I do n't know . '' \nBut Mr Hitchens said he was `` depressed by the ease with which a cheap point can get applause in the mouth of a really unscrupulous person . \nWhen I turned my head - which I tried not to do - it was like looking straight into the piggy eyes of fascism . '' \nMr Galloway is on a speaking tour of America to promote his new book about the Senate hearings , Mr Galloway Goes to Washington . \n"}

'' \nDoes he consider the antiwar movement unpatriotic ? \n`` I hear people on the left saying ` do n't question my patriotism ' - but you do n't see a -LRB- US -RRB- flag in sight at the antiwar protests , '' he says . \nUnsurprisingly , Mackey 's own assessment of the occupation is at odds with that presented in most of the world 's media - bar , perhaps , Fox News . \n`` It 's going fantastically well in a way that 's not being reported in the news , '' he says . \n`` I understand 3,000 schools have been built and women have the right to vote and not to be raped by Uday Hussein . '' \nGiven his views , I ask him whether he 's concerned about being interviewed by a liberal website like Guardian Unlimited ? \n`` You 're liberal ? \nThat 's not what I 'd heard , '' he says . \n`` A friend of mine said you were like Fox News on the web . \nMaybe it was Sky News . '' \nI suddenly imagine the sound of my editor-in-chief choking on her lunch . \nSome critics argue that Liberality is so far-fetched it does n't work as satire . \nGiven her father 's shenanigans while in office , would Chelsea really be likely to want to go back to the Oval Office ? \n`` She 's a moderate in the book . \nI think she 's a sympathetic character , '' he says . \nMackey admits it was `` almost too ridiculous to use him '' until he saw Moore sitting in the place of honor next to Jimmy Carter at the Democratic party national convention during the US election campaign . \n`` Then it almost became dangerously prophetic , '' he says . \n`` But the book 's meant to be fun . \nIt 's not propaganda . \nIt 's not like I 've made a movie and called it a documentary like Michael Moore did . '' \nThe furore has attracted coverage from newspapers including the Boston Globe and talk radio , helping the Liberality website notch up 500.000 hits in two months . \nNot bad for a self-published comic with a print run of just 10,000 copies . \nIt 's doubtful Mackey will find a big audience outside the US , though . \nUK readers are probably aware of Oliver North , given his involvement in the covert sale of arms to Iran during the Reagan administration . \nBut would they recognize his other two heroes ? \nMaybe a few will recall G Gordon Liddy , who was involved in the Watergate break-in that led to Richard Nixon 's resignation , but Sean Hannity , a rightwing talk show host , is unheard outside of the US . \nComics , in London , have ordered just one copy - and only out of morbid curiousity . \nBut we Brits should perhaps be grateful we come off lightly in this nightmare vision of the future . \nThe UK is noticeably absent from the countries applauding Bin Laden 's UN address in the first issue . \n`` That was me tipping my hat to you guys , '' Mackey says . \n`` I 've got a lot of time for Tony Blair . \nI tried to envisage where the UK was in my reality . \nI think the British government would be very conservative .

{"id": "270", "time": "2005-11-21", "text": "The hunt for Iraq 's lost treasure When thousands of antiquities were looted from Baghdad 's Iraq museum , US marine Matthew Bogdanos pledged to get them back . \nAfter two years of sleuthing , he has become a national hero . \nJulian Borger reports On April 15 , 2003 , in the Iraqi city of Basra , an enraged British journalist whose name has been lost to history stormed up to a US marine colonel and his men and denounced them as `` macho assholes '' . \nThe colonel had been looking for weapons and cash left behind by the ousted Iraqi regime , but this reporter believed fiercely that he should be more concerned that `` the finest museum in the world has just been looted '' . \nBy a peculiar turn of fate , she had stumbled on the one person in the whole of modern Mesopotamia who both cared deeply about the cultural calamity at Baghdad 's Iraq museum and possessed the expertise , determination and clout to do something about it . \nHis name was Matthew Bogdanos - a Greek-American classics scholar and a New York prosecutor , whose toughness and tenacity had earned him the nickname `` pit bull '' even before he went off to fight the `` war on terror '' . \nColonel Bogdanos can not remember the name of the reporter who vented her frustration at him , but she appears to have set off an extraordinary train of events . \nFive days after the encounter , he had overcome the objections of his superior officers and was at the gates of the Baghdad museum , heading a mixed bag of volunteer soldiers and investigators , ready to hunt down Iraq 's lost legacy . \nWhat followed over the next two years was an epic feat of wartime sleuthing which took Bogdanos along a trail from pitch-black underground chambers and submerged bank vaults in Baghdad to the sleek antiquity dealerships of Madison Avenue , in pursuit of lost treasures with Harry Potterish names , such as the Sacred Vase of Warka . \nAlong the way , more than 5,000 artworks , including unique pieces from the first fluttering of civilisation , were recovered . \nBogdanos left active duty in the marines last month , but he is still on the hunt for the thousands of objects still unaccounted for . \nWhen he returns to the Manhattan district attorney 's office , where he worked before the September 11 attacks , he has permission , he says , to set up a new arts and antiquities unit . \nThe story so far is told in his new book , Thieves of Baghdad , the royalties from which will go back to the Iraq museum . \nIt traces his path from poring over the Iliad while helping out at his father 's Greek restaurant as a boy , to prosecuting Puff Daddy in New York , to the turning point of September 11 . \nHis apartment was a few hundred yards from the North Tower and his family was lucky to survive its collapse . \nAs a marine reservist , he immediately volunteered for active duty and his investigative skills were rapidly put to use in Afghanistan , tracking down Taliban documents , including an all-important membership ledger . \nHe followed the action to Iraq , his fateful meeting with the contemptuous British reporter and his present incarnation as a marine corps Indiana Jones . \nThese days , Bogdanos is feted as a hero in Washington . \nTen days ago , he was in the Oval Office where George Bush -LRB- `` appreciative and knowledgeable '' -RRB- awarded him the National Humanities Medal . \nAll the acclaim notwithstanding , Bogdanos gives the impression of boiling with anger from the first hello . \nHe launches into a tirade against media reports of the looting -LRB- including the Guardian 's account -RRB- which exaggerated the number of stolen objects , claiming 170,000 were missing . \nAccording to Bogdanos the figure was less than a tenth of that . \nAnd he is still infuriated by the suggestion that , as he puts it , `` Coalition forces stood idly by as looters ransacked the museum . '' \nThat , he insists , `` is simply and undeniably factually inaccurate '' . \nBetween April 10 and 12 2003 , when most of the thefts took place , Bogdanos says the museum was being used as a redoubt by Iraqi Special Republican Guard troops . \n`` It simply could not have been secured without a battle that would have been devastating , or blood loss that would have been criminal on the part of the commander on the ground , '' he says . \nOn the other hand , and with an equal measure of outrage , Bogdanos holds the US forces responsible for taking four days to arrive at the museum after the management 's appeal for help on April 12 . \n`` It 's not sinister . \nIt 's not evil . \nIt 's inexcusable , '' he says . \nIn those four days , he says , the museum 's Iraqi curators kept the thieves of Baghdad at bay themselves , but much of the damage had already been done . \nHalf an hour into the interview , Bogdanos is still fighting mad , and it is clear that enraged bellowing is his default mode of communication . \nA truly accurate transcript of our interview would have to be entirely in capital letters , punctuated with multiple exclamation and question marks , and occasionally hyphenated to show where he slows down , as if instructing a raw teenage recruit . \nIs he always so hot under the collar ? \n`` Injustice always angers me , '' he replies . \nBogdanos believes there were three classes of robber at work : looters who cleared museum shelves at random ; professionals who knew what they were looking for , perhaps taking orders from foreign dealers ; and inside operators - employees or ex-employees who knew where particular treasures were hidden , using the chaos of the war as a cover to grab them . \nThe distinction between the second and third group is somewhat blurred , but Bogdanos presents compelling evidence that inside knowledge was involved . \nHe followed the robbers ' footprints into an underground storage room that had been bricked off from the rest of the museum , where an acrid stench suggested they had had to work in darkness , burning improvised torches . \nSomehow the thieves had found their way to a hidden set of keys and used them to open lockers containing a unique collection of ancient cylindrical seals . \nBy some fluke , however , the keys had been dropped halfway through the heist and the thieves had been unable to recover them in the smoke-filled murk . \nThey fled before they found the collection of gold coins , which survives almost intact . \nPerhaps more surprising than the number of treasures stolen was the number brought back . \nOne of the first steps decided upon , was when Bogdanos and the museum authorities declared an amnesty with no questions asked and a cup of tea for anything returned . \nThe colonel and his men fanned out into the Baghdad bazaars and spread the word . \nAntiquities soon started turning up at the museum gates . \nOne car delivered 94 artifacts . \nBy the time Bogdanos left , 1,952 missing pieces had been handed back . \n`` There is n't one single reason for it , '' he says . \n`` You name it : fear of getting caught , conscience , recognition that they were no longer stealing from Hussein but stealing from themselves ... There are 1,952 reasons . '' \nThe network of informants Bogdanos built up in the bazaar led his men to other finds . \nThe Mask of Warka , a 3100BC limestone mask thought to be the earliest surviving naturalistic depiction of a human face , was found buried on a farm north of Baghdad . \nA precious statue was found wrapped and submerged in a septic tank . \nThe most valuable pieces , however , are already likely to be tucked away in private collections in the US and Europe , but Bogdanos thinks there are still ways to get them back . \n`` If you are willing to spend $ 20 , $ 30 , $ 40m for a piece of alabaster with funny writing on it that you can never publicly acknowledge owning and never show off , the first thing you are going to want to know is if that piece is authentic , '' he says . \n`` Are you going to take the dealer 's word that it 's real ? \nAre you going to take a graduate student 's word for it ? \nNo , you 're going to get the head of a department , the head of a museum or someone who is published in the field . '' \nSo the focus of the hunt moves now from Baghdad to New York , where Bogdanos will set up his new investigative unit . \nMeanwhile , he is playing it cool , fielding offers from Hollywood for his story . \nAny film , he insists , would have to advance his central aim - getting the lost art back . \n`` If it 's going to be done in pure Indiana Jones style , then it 's not going to advance the ball . \nBut if it 's going to be done seriously and intelligently , but as fun as well , then I 'm for it , '' he barks . \n`` I love movies . \nI loved Indiana Jones '' . \n"}

{"id": "111", "time": "2005-09-12", "text": "During the past century the United States has faced two brutal assaults . \nWithin four years of the first , on December 7 1941 , the US and its allies had mobilised , taken on and defeated two powerful enemies , Japan and Germany . \nFour years after the second , on September 11 2001 , what real progress can the US and its allies honestly claim for the war on terror ? \nThe answer , tragically and alarmingly , is that they have not made enough . \nNot only is terror very much still with us , it is also on the increase . \nLast year , the US state department reported 651 `` significant terrorist attacks '' around the world , three times the total for 2003 and the highest annual number since Washington began to collect such statistics two decades ago . \nAround a third of those attacks took place in Iraq , supposedly the central front of the war on terror , in some parts of which terrorist killings have now reached pandemic levels . \nSince April , more than 4,000 Iraqis have been killed by terrorists in Baghdad alone . \nBut the killing is in no way confined to Iraq . \nNo one in London needs any reminder of that . \nAnd Britain , like the US and many others , is wrestling to balance established liberties and ways of life with the danger that another 9\\/11 , or another 7\\/7 , may occur at any time . \nThe assault on America four years ago this week was in every way as infamous a deed as the one committed by Japan in 1941 . \nMuch of the response to it , however , was not just ineffective but counter-productive . \nFaced with 9\\/11 , George Bush 's initial response was briefly both brainy and belligerent . \nBut the initial advantages were quickly squandered under pressure from the ideological right . \nBy choosing to rid the world of evil - above all in Iraq - rather than to hunt down , take out and politically disable al-Qaida , Mr Bush set his country on a path which continues to dismay America 's friends and to delight its enemies . \nIn effect , though , he also did Osama bin Laden 's job for him . \nThe war on terror , with its rhetoric of a battle between good and evil and its talk of a fight that will last for generations , depended for credibility upon the efficacy of American power and upon the accuracy of the US neocon prescription of a `` democratic revolution '' across the Middle East . \nIn reality , both have proved to be wishful thinking - the real surprise being the limits of the US military effort . \nAmerica has fought and occupied , but it has not shown that it can rebuild . \nThe idea that Iraq would set off a domino democratic effect across the Middle East now seems even more preposterous than ever - if Iraq is exporting anything to its neighbors , it is violence not democracy . \nFaced with a ruthless insurgency , American public opinion is faltering as the gulf on the ground between reality and objectives widens . \nPost-Katrina , the question is not whether the US will begin to withdraw - but when , how and , above all , with what damage . \nPolitically this may be inevitable and even desirable - but we will all live with the consequences . \nThe most damning charge against the war on terror is that it has been a recruiting sergeant for the very forces it sought to destroy . \nAs Mark Danner put it in the New York Times yesterday , Mr Bush 's failure to focus on al-Qaida has created a global `` al-Qaidaism '' of the kind that struck this country on July 7 . \nSuch al-Qaidaism is not going to go away . \nIf the earlier generation could produce a 9\\/11 in the face of American power , what will the next generation produce in the wake of the American weakness inseparable from an Iraq withdrawal ? \nBin Laden 's organization may have been damaged and disrupted since 2001 , and his dreadful cause may in many places be in the hands of amateurs , but he could never have dreamed that the world four years after the twin towers would look so favourable to his objectives . \n"}

'' \nOther soldiers standing a few feet away joked among themselves . \nFor Reuters and many other foreign media organizations in Baghdad the August 28 shooting was further evidence that American troops are out of control . \nSince the 2003 invasion US forces have killed at least 18 media workers in incidents for which no one has been charged or punished . \nThere have been no satisfactory investigations that we know of , '' said Rodney Pinder , director of the International News Safety Institute -LRB- INSI -RRB- , a Brussels-based advocacy group . \nAngry and frustrated , several radio and television networks , agencies and newspapers , including the Guardian , met last week to chart a joint response to the crisis . \nThe gathering agreed to form a foreign correspondents ' association and to jointly lobby the US military and state department . \nMore journalists have been killed in Iraq in two years than during the 20 years of conflict in Vietnam , according to Reporters Without Borders . \nIt counted 66 dead in Iraq compared to 63 in Vietnam and 49 in the former Yugoslavia between 1991 and 1995 . \nINSI estimates the Iraq toll at 81 while the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists reckons 74 . \nInsurgents killed most and with few exceptions , such as the Italian Enzo Baldoni , the victims were Iraqis . \nForeign journalists , based in fortified hotels or compounds , can move discreetly around the capital and accompany coalition troops on missions but they routinely rely on Iraqi colleagues for on the ground reporting . \nIncreasingly US forces pose the graver threat . \n`` It is becoming impossible for us in good conscience to send out reporters to gather information because we do n't know what will happen to them , '' says Richard Engel , a correspondent for the US television network NBC . \nIf something goes wrong , he says , `` we do n't know what procedures if any exist to follow up . '' \nThe International Federation of Journalists accused the US military of `` incompetence , reckless soldiering , and cynical disregard '' for journalists ' lives . \nThe Committee to Protect Journalists said there appeared to be official `` indifference '' to reporters ' deaths . \nIn addition to shooting them , US forces have a habit of detaining journalists without charge . \nWeeks can pass before a bureau is able to confirm that an employee has been arrested , possibly injured , and held incommunicado in Abu Ghraib or another prison . \nA driver for the Guardian , accredited with the US authorities , was held without explanation for five days . \nAt stake is not only the existence of independent media , says Alastair Macdonald , Reuters ' Baghdad bureau chief , but the credibility of US claims to be fostering democracy . \n`` The American ambassador recently called us the fourth estate , a pillar of the democracy , but we 're not being allowed to do our job here . '' \nWhen the US military detains employees media organizations try to sort it out privately , going through regular channels , appealing to the relevant major or colonel , until it dawns that this does not work . \nAsked at a recent press conference if there was a special policy for journalists , a handful of the 10,000 US-held detainees , Major General Rick Lynch , a US military spokesman , was blunt : `` That 's a no. . \nWhat we 've got to do is look at the individual that was indeed detained and what was he doing , regardless of what his profession is . '' \nMany correspondents say the fundamental problem is that US forces do not recognize the media 's right to work in Iraq . \nAlmost every single Iraqi stringer in Mosul , a volatile northern city , has been arrested , including a freelance cameraman for CBS who was shot in April and has been detained since without charge . \nInvestigations into shootings are conducted by an officer from the unit which opened fire . \nInvariably shooters are exonerated and victims deemed at least partly culpable . \nWaleed Khaled 's case was typical . \nA three-day investigation concluded the 35-year-old Reuters soundman was driving fast , stopped , immediately reversed and that he or Haider Kadhem , the cameraman , leaned out with what appeared to be a weapon . \n`` Our soldiers on the scene , using established rules of engage-ment and all the training received , decided that it was appropriate to engage that particular car . '' \nIn other words the popular , jokey newsroom presence , the husband of a pregnant wife , the father of a four-year-old girl , brought it on himself . \nHis colleague Kadhem , 24 , was released without charge after three days of questioning about `` inconsistencies '' in his story . \nUS military spokesmen often cite `` strong evidence '' that an arrested Iraqi was an insurgent who used his work as cover . \nDespite astonishing allegations - including the shooting down of a helicopter by three journalists - no proof has emerged publicly . \nHardly a surprise given that the legal process is secret and reports are not published . \nA smear or not , hinting at evidence can intimidate an employer less than 100 % sure about a stringer 's background . \n`` They make you ask yourself if you really want to bat for this guy , '' says one bureau chief . \nSuch tactics contrast with the military 's warm embrace of those who `` embed '' , a well-oiled , largely transparent system which allows journalists to attach themselves limpet-like to troops . \nEverything is on the record and what you file , though monitored once published or broadcast , is uncensored . \nThe openness and access -LRB- not to mention the food -RRB- tends to be better than the more controlled British version . \nThere is no consensus on why there is such hostility to independent media . \nSome think it reflects the clumsiness of an army wrestling with a complicated guerrilla campaign . \nInsurgent cameramen do accompany gunmen and film attacks which end up on the internet . \nWhen a television crew arrives during or immediately after a fight troops often suspect the crew knew in advance . \nAn urban myth , say the networks , but a dangerous one when even an established name like CNN is branded the Communist News Network . \nThere is scant evidence that US troops deliberately target the press , unlike Israeli soldiers in the West Bank and Gaza . \nBut commanders who view Iraq as an information war have an interest in blocking images they deem damaging . \nIn a rare cracking of the opaque military Phillip Robertson , a reporter for the online magazine Salon.com , found the sniper who shot his friend Yasser Salihee , an Iraqi employee of the Knight-Ridder newspaper group . \nSalihee died instantly when a bullet entered his right eye as he drove towards a checkpoint in Baghdad in June . \nNamed only as Joe , the sniper said his unit was braced for a suicide bomber and that the car appeared suspicious . \nJoe was troubled by the feeling that his victim was not an insurgent . \n`` I really hope he was a bad guy . \nDo you know anything about him ?

{"id": "138", "time": "2005-11-19", "text": "Martin Kettle finds both wisdom and self-regard in the memoirs of British ambassador Sir Christopher Meyer , DC Confidential 302pp , Weidenfeld & Nicolson , # 20 That Christopher Meyer 's memoirs have been as controversial as their subtitle confidently asserts them to be is already a matter of record . \nBut , read in the round , how does the book as a whole actually emerge ? \nMy answer is that Meyer 's book is both better and worse than the headline-generating extracts suggest . \nIt is better because , contrary to the implication of its subtitle , this is not only a book about 9\\/11 and the Iraq war , crucially important though these subjects are . \nMeyer 's account of these events is painted on a wider canvas . \nHis Washington years stretched from autumn 1997 to the start of 2003 , so he was gone by the time the war began . \nThe majority of his time in DC fell within the Clinton presidency , not the Bush one . \nIndeed Bush barely makes an appearance in this memoir until around half way through . \nSeen in that light , this is an important book about what it was like to be Britain 's most senior and lustrous ambassador at a time when the prime minister enjoyed a direct line to the White House for which there are few precedents . \nThe strength of the Blair-Clinton and the Blair-Bush relationships was of vast advantage to Meyer , as he acknowledges . \nIt meant that long before 9\\/11 , though certainly in its aftermath , he was able to bathe in reflected glory . \nIt was , as he rightly says , a good time to be British in America . \nThat was just as true in the Clinton as in the Blair years ; there were `` Blair for President '' chants in Chicago as early as 1999 , Meyer recalls . \nBut the Downing Street-White House relationship was always the worm in the bud for the embassy , and by the time of Iraq it became both pettily and substantively intolerable to an ambassador who had an unusual taste for the limelight . \nEven before Bush , a lot of British discourse about America was mere caricature : under every president since JFK , too many British commentators have succumbed to the lazy temptation to regard the United States as a country of mad people governed by buffoons . \nUnder Bush that tendency has become much more extreme . \nSo it is useful to be reminded by Meyer that Bush is a more substantial figure than most here have come to regard him . \nAnd it is gratifying to read Meyer expounding wisdoms about America that can only come from experience . \nEvery September , Meyer recalls , he would gather new arrivals to the embassy together and give them a little pep talk . \nThe core of that message was always the same : `` Think of the US as a foreign country , then you will be pleasantly surprised by the many things you find in common with this most generous and hospitable of people . \nThink of America as Britain writ large and you risk coming to grief ; American attitudes to patriotism , religion , crime and punishment , schooling , sex , the outside world , can be very different from those of Europeans , including the British . '' \nAnyone who has spent time in America will recognize the accuracy of that . \nMeyer is wisely unsentimental , too , about the so-called `` special relationship '' . \nThe phrase was banned from use while he was ambassador , quite rightly , and he smartly observes that the only countries that can truly lay claim to such a status in Washington - in the sense of being able to have significant influence on US politics and policy - are Ireland , Israel , Saudi Arabia and Taiwan , and certainly not Britain , even under Blair or Thatcher . \nMy dissatisfaction with Meyer 's book is not that he has written it . \nIt is that his indiscretion is selective and even calculated . \nAs the now celebrated extracts showed , Meyer has little compunction about putting the stiletto into politicians - and into Cherie Blair , who did the Meyers many kindnesses in her time , for which she is meanly rewarded here . \nMeyer is also more generous to Gordon Brown in these pages - I wonder why that could be ? \n- than he was in private , when he regularly complained about the chancellor 's repeated and childish snubs . \nHe is also protective towards fellow diplomats , officials and mandarins . \nMeyer 's relationship with the former diplomat Jonathan Powell , Blair 's chief-of-staff , was pivotal to his Washington years . \nSo were his connections to John Sawers and Matthew Rycroft , both of them senior ex-Washington embassy figures who worked for Blair in vital periods . \nCrucial players all , yet they move as silently through Meyer 's account as Inspector Bucket does through much of Bleak House Then there is the Catherine question . \nChristopher Meyer was an ambassadorial moderniser - nice , approachable , sociable and very comfortable with the media . \nHe and Catherine were high-profile Washingtonians , and there was much talk towards the end of his term that they would decamp to New York on his retirement to become a Manhattan power couple to rival Harry and Tina themselves . \nIt sometimes seemed to me that they risked overstepping the mark in this networking , and Meyer 's account of Catherine 's eurosceptic conversations with Rupert Murdoch and Richard Perle rather confirms that . \nRunning through this book there is not just a mandarin 's frustration with ministers but a radical Conservative 's disdain towards Labor , even though I firmly believe that Meyer mostly did an exceptional job on Blair 's behalf . \nIn the end , though , it all comes inescapably back to Iraq . \nIraq is inevitably both the pivotal subject in Meyer 's account and the one on which he allows himself the most sustained exposition of his own views . \nMeyer makes a powerful case for the view that Britain could have caused the Bush administration to delay the invasion until late 2003 , giving time to bring France and Russia onside for a second UN resolution , perhaps even forcing Saddam to quit , but certainly enabling proper attention to be given to a UN-centred plan for the post-Saddam Iraq . \nWould it have worked ? \nWho can now say ? \nBut Meyer and many others of us have every right to be extremely angry that it was never given a chance . \nMartin Kettle was the Guardian 's Washington bureau chief from 1997 to 2001 . \nTo order a copy of DC Confidential for # 18 with free UK p & p call Guardian book service on 08708360875 Write your review of this or any other book , find out what other readers thought or add it to your lists Letters for publication should be sent to : letters@guardian.co.uk If you need help using the site : userhelp@guardian.co.uk Call the main Guardian and Observer switchboard : Review : DC Confidential by Christopher Meyer This article appeared on p10 of the Guardian review section of the Guardian on 01.19 GMT on Saturday 19 November 2005 Latest news and views from the Guardian 's books team paullaity : Read this : clever and funny and rightly cutting . \n"}
{"id": "101", "time": "2005-11-19", "text": "Andrey Kurkov on A Writer at War , Vasily Grossman 's long-suppressed memoir With each new war that occurs -LRB- the liberation of Kuwait , the action in Afghanistan and now in Iraq -RRB- you might expect the second world war to fade further into the mists of history . \nIn fact , as the years go by , the quantity of material increases and the picture we have of it grows ever more detailed and vivid . \nA Writer at War is the diary of the Soviet engineer turned writer Vasily Grossman . \nIt offers a wealth of new details and known facts seen from a new angle , but what is most striking about this book is the writer 's extraordinarily subtle , almost childishly attentive view of the war . \nGrossman is a very interesting character . \nHe grew up in the Jewish town of Berdichev , in Ukraine , where in the first days of Nazi occupation his mother , having refused to be evacuated , was shot . \nGrossman , whose poor health made him unfit for military service , soon became one of three leading Soviet war correspondents . \nThe works of the other two , Ilya Ehrenburg and Konstantin Simonov , became classics of Soviet literature . \nGrossman 's works did not , and this book shows why . \nThe main task of the correspondent was to produce articles showing the heroism of the Soviet soldiers . \nThe Red Star newspaper was practically the only source of information available to the soldiers and it was the hub of the Soviet propaganda machine , which had to maintain the soldiers ' fighting spirit and their faith in the eventual Soviet victory over fascism . \nGrossman spent his time on the front line seeking out examples of heroism , but his notebook contains everything he saw and experienced there . \nSome of his notes were obviously made for himself ; no censor would have let them through . \nHowever , even the articles about heroic deeds were `` edited '' , if not rewritten , often turning Grossman 's accounts of real events into biblical myths . \nIn his letters home - included in the book - Grossman complained about this editorial meddling . \nThe battle of Stalingrad has a central place in the book , just as the battle was pivotal in the history of the war . \nGrossman 's picture of it is quite different from the apocalypse traditionally described by military historians . \nThe stories he tells , either overheard or told directly to him , are all carefully recorded , and sometimes completely untrue . \nOccasionally he admits as much in his notes , but , none the less , Grossman the writer is fascinated by all of them . \nIf , having read this book , you read Grossman 's most famous novel , Life and Fate , you will recognize a great many of the characters and events . \nThe story that particularly struck me was one about the dogs that lived among the ruins of Stalingrad , which could differentiate between the sound of a German plane and a Soviet one . \nThe dogs started to bark long before the ground forces heard approaching German planes , but they were silent when Soviet planes flew over , as if they recognized their own . \nIn the next paragraph Grossman describes how at night the Germans tied geese up around the outskirts of the villages they occupied , to be certain that the villagers did not get prior warning of any approaching trouble . \nThe detail with which Grossman describes the extermination camp of Treblinka horrifies by underlining the mechanical functionalism of those terrible death camps . \nHere the technical quality of Grossman 's notes reflects his early career as a mining engineer . \nHis article about Treblinka , published in Znamya , was used as evidence in the Nuremberg trials . \nAs Grossman moved west with the advancing forces , he became intent on calculating the number of holocaust victims . \nHe attempted to include information specifically about Jewish victims in his articles , but the censor removed every mention of them . \nAlthough state Stalinist anti-semitism was not yet established , Soviet newspaper editors were already well aware of Stalin 's personal opinion on the matter : `` We should not categorise the dead according to nationality or race ; they are all victims of fascism . '' \nOn the advice of Ehrenburg , Grossman became a member of the Jewish Anti-fascist Committee . \nHe helped in the preparation of The Black Book , which detailed fascist crimes against the Jews . \nBut after the war , the publication of the The Black Book was banned by the Soviet censor . \nThe repression of the committee did not daunt Ehrenburg or Grossman , but the latter paid dearly for his objectivity and his humane attitude to what he had seen . \nLife and Fate is one of the most honest books about the second world war . \nAs soon as Grossman tried to publish it , KGB officers raided his apartment and confiscated every copy they could find . \nOne copy , which Grossman had given to a friend for safe-keeping , survived , and eventually , after the author 's death , a microfilm copy was smuggled out of the USSR . \nTo this day Grossman 's war diary has not been published in Russia . \nBritish readers are fortunate to have access to this honest and moving testimony . \nAndrey Kurkov 's A Matter of Life and Death is published by Harvill . \nTo order A Writer at War for # 18 with free UK p & p call Guardian book service on 08708360875 . \nWrite your review of this or any other book , find out what other readers thought or add it to your lists Letters for publication should be sent to : letters@guardian.co.uk If you need help using the site : userhelp@guardian.co.uk Call the main Guardian and Observer switchboard : Review : A Writer at War by Vasily Grossman This article appeared on p9 of the Guardian review section of the Guardian on 01.19 GMT on Saturday 19 November 2005 Latest news and views from the Guardian 's books team paullaity : Read this : clever and funny and rightly cutting . \n"}

What journalism is really about is to monitor power and the centres of power . '' \nFisk is perceived as anti-American , but scarcely any political leader escapes his lash . \nPraise is reserved for fellow-journalists - I counted 14 who are first-rate , brilliant , daring , meticulous , `` a blessing for journalism '' . \nHis forte is straight reporting , such as his three interviews with Osama bin Laden . \nAt least as good are his meetings with Saddam Hussein , Khomeini and Sadeq Khalkhali , the hanging judge of the Iranian revolution , and his close-ups of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan , the launch of Saddam 's war against Iran , an ambush by Islamists of an Algerian police patrol , and a lift into trouble in an Apache attack helicopter on the Iraq\\/Turkey border . \nRecounting his resignation from the Times , he hesitates : `` what is Fisk doing , I can hear hostile reviewers of this book ask - writing about the violent death of 290 innocent human beings and then taking up five pages to explain his petty rows with the Times ? '' \nFor this reviewer , at least , the problem is the opposite : sharp-focus reporting is submerged as horror is piled on horror - massacres and torture , atrocities by Turks , Iranians and Iraqis , Palestinians slaughtered by Israelis and Israelis slaughtered by Palestinians , Americans by Arabs and Arabs by Americans . \nOne example : five pages by Hussein Shahristani on being tortured in Iraq , reproduced verbatim because `` his story ... deserves to be told in full , in his own words '' . \n-LRB- He does not mention that in 2004 Shahristani was backed as prime minister of Iraq by the UN representative Lakhdar Brahimi , but sidelined by the Americans in favor of the US-based exile Iyad Allawi . -RRB- \nFisk compares his themes to those of Goya and Hieronymus Bosch , but Goya painted the Naked Maja as well as his black paintings , and Bosch painted earthly delights as well as the nightmare of hell . \nThat 's not Fisk . \n`` A fetid river -LRB- the Tigris -RRB- flowed slowly between treeless banks of gray sand beneath a dun-coloured sky . '' \nThe Persian Gulf , nowadays a tourist destination , `` looks not unlike Mars '' . \nTrue enough , but Thesiger he is n't . \nMuch more effective than reams of technicalities about the arms trade is the tale of tracing a missile used by the Israeli air force to murder civilians in Lebanon right back to the men in suits in Gainesville , Georgia , who manufactured it . \nAt the final confrontation , after producing the missile fragment bearing the tell-tale code number , he pushes across the table photographs of the children who died , images of blood and torn limbs . \n`` The executive on my left looked through them with distaste . \nThen he said : ' I do n't want these . ' '' \nAnd even Fisk felt `` oddly sad '' for him . \nIt 's worth quoting some penetrating insights . \nThe word `` settlements '' for the illegal Israeli presence in the occupied territories is `` almost comforting '' - the right word , as Fisk says , is `` colonising '' . \nEvery Palestinian knew that the four principal US officials handling the peace process for Washington in 1993 were Jews , and the Israeli press said so ; but the western press did not . \nFisk does n't mention Tony Blair 's appointment of Lord Levy as his personal Middle East envoy ; some of the Arab leaders who meet Levy appear to be under the impression that he represents Sharon rather than Blair . \nFisk describes how the French in the Algerian war of independence taught the Israelis their tactics . \nForty years later `` the Pentagon sent a delegation to Israel to study Israeli army tactics during the Palestinian intifada , so they could adopt these lessons in their own battle with Iraqi insurgents ... In some derivative and unconscious way , the Americans in Iraq may thus have been copying - at second hand - France 's equally deplorable tactics in the Algerian war of independence . '' \nIn the Kuwait war the allies ignored the Geneva Convention rules about enemy dead . \nGeneral Schwarzkopf said he was `` not in the business of body counts '' . \nBut as Fisk points out , `` even Hitler 's SS soldiers who were killed fighting the Americans around Bastogne in 1944 were identified and buried in marked graves '' . \nGeneral Tommy Franks was to repeat Schwarzkopf 's one-liner about body counts in the Iraq war of 2003 , with Blair giving the unfortunate impression that he does n't care . \n`` Guantnamo was a mirror of the treatment that every Middle East dictatorship meted out to its opponents . \nShackled , hooded , threatened with death by ` courts ' that would give no leeway to defense or innocence : this was how every Arab secret police force dealt with enemies of the regime . '' \nMany of the problems of the Middle East have their roots in the first world war , to which the book 's title is an allusion . \nFisk tries to knit the whole book together round a chapter on his father and his experiences in the war , but it does n't really work . \nWorse , it leads to oversimplification of history : the `` extraordinary lenity '' shown by the Allies to Turkey after the war , or the Northern Ireland conflict , `` that legacy of British colonial rule '' . \nThe book 's second title remains a mystery ; who has conquered the Middle East ? \nThe book contains a deplorable number of mistakes . \nSome are amusing : my favorite is when King Hussein 's stallion unexpectedly `` reared up on her hind legs '' . \nChrist was born in Bethlehem , not Jerusalem . \nNapoleon 's army did not burn Moscow , the Russians did . \nFrench : meurt means dies , not blooms . \nRussian : goodbye is do svidanya , not dos vidanya . \nFarsi : laleh means tulip , not rose . \nArabic : catastrophe is nakba not nakhba -LRB- which means elite -RRB- , and many more . \nOther mistakes undermine the reader 's confidence . \nMuhammad 's nephew Ali was murdered in the 7th century , not the 8th century . \nBaghdad was never an Ummayad city . \nThe Hashemites are not a Gulf tribe but a Hijaz tribe , as far as you can get from the Gulf and still be in Arabia . \nThe US forward base for the Kuwait war , Dhahran , is not `` scarcely 400 miles '' from Medina and the Muslim holy places , it is about 700 miles . \nBritain during the Palestine mandate did not support a Jewish state . \nThe 1939 white paper on Palestine did not `` abandon Balfour 's promise '' -LRB- and he was not `` Lord Balfour '' when he made it -RRB- . \nThe Iraq revolution of 1958 was not Baathist . \nBritain did not pour military hardware into Saddam 's Iraq for 15 years , or call for an uprising against Saddam in 1991 . \nThese last two `` mistakes '' occasion lengthy Philippics against British policy ; others may deserve them , we do not . \nThere are no illustrations in the text , but there is an end paper portrait of Bin Laden , looking benign but , oddly , a bit drunk . \nA great book is a great evil , wrote Callimachus . \nVigilant editing and ruthless pruning could perhaps have made two or three good short books out of this one . \nOliver Miles is a former British ambassador to Libya , Luxembourg and Greece Write your review of this or any other book , find out what other readers thought or add it to your lists Letters for publication should be sent to : letters@guardian.co.uk If you need help using the site : userhelp@guardian.co.uk Call the main Guardian and Observer switchboard : Review : The Great War for Civilisation by Robert Fisk This article appeared on p9 of the Guardian review section of the Guardian on 01.19 GMT on Saturday 19 November 2005 Latest news and views from the Guardian 's books team paullaity : Read this : clever and funny and rightly cutting . \n"}

Kenneth Tarver and Talise Trevigne in Armida In the Cafe de France in Essaouira , a beautiful walled city on Morocco 's Atlantic coast , some British people are making an opera . \nIt 's called Armida and tells the story of a soldier and a TV newshound who set aside their differences during some nameless contemporary desert war and fall in love . \nBut the locals do n't know or - let 's be honest - care about any of that . \nAll they 're bothered about is that today is Thursday , Morocco 's national lottery day , and they need to buy their tickets from the bloke in the cafe 's back room . \nIn between takes , a line of men is suffered by director Margaret Williams to walk across her set and return with a ticket each . \nReally , she should have shot the locals , too , and thereby made a second film featuring the characterful faces of Essaouira 's lottery junkies as they move nimbly across a landscape of cameras , cables , microphones and opera singers . \nIt could have been a culture-clash ballet , or maybe a sitcom . \nBut Williams 's task is difficult enough as it is . \nShe is filming an opera to be screened on television . \nIt 's the hardest job in the world - and , ratings-wise at least , one of the least rewarding . \nHave you ever tried to film a scene of soldiers playing football in a desert sandstorm with the sand lashing the opera singers ' faces and getting into the camera ? \nAnd have you ever tried to condense four centuries of myth-making about the Rinaldo and Armida love affair into a 50-minute opera that alludes to the Iraq war , without being exclusively about that conflict , to be screened on Channel 4 with one commercial break ? \n`` It 's even more difficult than that , '' says Philip Headlam , the conductor , removing his headphones between takes . \n`` It 's not like your normal opera from the canon , where everybody is familiar with the music and their roles in the story . \nOur singers have not heard it before , so it takes a lot of time and a lot of care to get it right . \nAnd then they have to perform in front of the cameras , which is very difficult if , as a singer , you 're not used to it . '' \nThe opera has already been sung in a studio and now the singers have to act and sing their parts in sync with a tape played back in the cafe . \nHeadlam 's task is to ensure they keep in time . \nTricky enough without being interrupted after every take by impatient Essaouirans demanding their tickets . \nJudith Weir , the composer , is an oasis of calm amid the transcultural crossness . \nShe sits , enviably self-contained , next to the cafe 's pool table , sipping mint tea from a glass . \n`` All my work is done . \nSo I 'm really just here to observe - and have a holiday , '' she says . \nShe started writing Armida in 2002 . \n`` All the eyes of the world were on Iraq at the time , but I was n't trying to write about Iraq in particular , just all the wars I 've lived through . '' \nThis also presented her with an opportunity to think about the medium for which she had been commissioned to write - television . \n`` I wanted to write an opera which deals in part with the TV coverage of wars . \nWe have become so aware of how we receive the news , and even how reporters come from behind the camera to talk about their feelings during conflict . \nSo I wanted to engage with that . '' \nThat 's not something you 'd expect an opera to do , at least not successfully . \n`` The position that classical music has in our society does make it rather removed from current affairs , '' Weir concedes . \n`` It 's presented as this refuge from modern life , where you go to have a comfortable sleep , often in a concert . \nI do n't think my work is removed from everyday life . '' \nShe has certainly done her utmost to place the romantic story of Rinaldo and Armida , a Christian crusader and a Muslim witch , in today 's world . \nTo anyone familiar with the many treatments of the tale , Weir 's version is a brave departure : Armida is no longer a sorceress but a TV news reporter , the setting a media-saturated desert conflict . \nIt 's a controversial idea , and surely fraught with pitfalls . \nIn Torquato Tasso 's 16th-century poem Jerusalem Delivered , which inspired nearly 100 operas and ballets -LRB- mostly baroque -RRB- , Armida is a hotsy-totsy Saracen sorceress at the time of the first Crusade , seeking to use her wiles to weaken the crusaders ' cause . \nShe is enraged by the French crusader Rinaldo for freeing comrades she has bewitched , and also because he alone of the Christian army besieging Jerusalem remains unmoved by her charms . \nSo she plans to kill him - but is so captivated by his beauty that she changes her mind . \nShe carries him off to her enchanted castle on an island , where she puts him under a spell so that he falls in love with her . \nEventually , Rinaldo is discovered on the island by his comrades , who confront him with his amorous folly by showing him his own degraded reflection in his shield . \nRinaldo , though still torn by feelings of love for Armida , abandons her and declares revenge . \nArmida responds furiously by assembling an army , intending to kill Rinaldo . \nBut when she finally meets him in an enchanted forest , her lingering affection for him renders her incapable of killing him , and she contemplates suicide . \nRinaldo prevents her from destroying herself , and the two are reconciled with the implication that Armida will convert to Christianity and marry Rinaldo . \nBut that is only one ending of the story . \nIn the operatic adaptations by Gluck -LRB- 1777 -RRB- and Rossini -LRB- 1817 -RRB- , the drama ends when Rinaldo abandons Armida on her enchanted island . \nIn Dvorak 's 1904 version , by contrast , a disguised Armida is killed by Rinaldo in battle and the pair are reconciled , as she dies , with her baptism . \nWith all this weight of previous interpretation , how did Weir decide to tell the story ? \nThe Dvorak version appealed least of all - not least because of its ending , which mingles the heroine 's death with Christian triumphalism . \n`` In fact , no one can say anything about the religious affiliation or ethnicity of any of the characters in my opera , '' says Weir . \n`` No one can say , this is a Muslim or this is a Christian . \nI wanted to show that I respect all the people in this piece . '' \nBoth of the leads , Talise Trevigne and Kenneth Tarver , are black , thus perhaps further annulling the eurocentrism of Tasso 's original poem and several later treatments . \nEven more significantly , Weir did n't want her female heroine killed off . \n`` The issue of women singers in opera is important . \nWomen have big roles in opera . \nBut those characters nearly always die terrible deaths as they 're punished for their uppityness . \nI wanted a woman you could believe in and not a crazy opera type . '' \nOf the operas that precede hers , Weir says : `` Rossini 's is the one that still stands up . \nIt is one of Maria Callas 's great roles . '' \nBut while she admits that she was inspired by them , `` there is no quotation from them '' . \nInstead , her music is scored for an ensemble that is half jazz band and half classical group , and tips between the two . \nIn Armida , Weir re-explores a theme she addressed in her earlier TV opera , Scipio 's Dream -LRB- a homage to Mozart also directed by Margaret Williams in 1991 -RRB- , namely the conflict between love and duty . \nArmida and Rinaldo are both torn by this conflict - they should n't love each other , since duty forbids it , but they do . \n`` I find the story interesting because it 's both a love story and a political story , '' says Weir . \n`` But it 's a love story , too , about the affair between the media and the war operation . \nIt 's also a war story about love - because love can be a war as well . '' \nHer opera -LRB- she wrote both music and libretto -RRB- starts at the army camp from where the infidels are being besieged . \nArmida comes to the camp , ostensibly to interview the soldiers , but secretly to subvert their cause . \nBut she falls in love with Rinaldo -LRB- a sensitive soul who writes poetry and quotes Taoist philosophy -RRB- , and whisks him off in her TV news helicopter to an enchanted Moorish city . \nHis comrades try to free him , but he has other ideas . \nCa n't they see he 's in love and has renounced war - as they should ? \nUnlike previous artists , Weir was hardly interested in using the story to press home a message of Christians triumphing over Muslims . \nAnd she emphasises that she did n't want to write `` an opera about Iraq '' . \n`` There was n't time to get into any sophisticated politics , '' she says , `` but I wanted to explore the idea , ` What if they held a war and nobody came ? ' '' \nWas she in favor of the Iraq war ? \n`` I think the whole thing is absolutely ludicrous . '' \nArmida is , then , an opera with an anti-war message . \nAs viewers return again and again to the army camp , they find that the soldiers have started to plant lavender bushes and grow vegetables in the desert . \nAnd , around the world , enthusiasm for war and duty decline , while love triumphs . \nNobody is interested in watching war porn ; instead , Metropolis TV now specialises in gardening shows and allied weather reports . \nJournalism , like soldiering , is to be replaced by what Weir in her libretto calls `` cultivation and repose '' . \nAll of which , no doubt , is a healthy message in our benighted times . \nBut it does make one hanker for the more fractious ending to Rossini 's version of Armida . \nThere , the abandoned heroine , torn between love and anger , commands her spirits to destroy the enchanted island she created , before flying away on her chariot pulled by dragons amid thunder and lightning . \nNow , that would have made for good telly . \nBut Channel 4 's opera budget probably does n't stretch that far . \n"}

'' \nBritish soldier Lance-Corporal George Solomou , who refused his call-up to serve in Iraq , was also at the front of the march . \nHe said : `` I am here to show my solidarity . \nThe British people are increasingly realizing that they have been told more and more lies about the war . '' \nJanet Brown , a retired teacher from Manchester , said : `` The war is corrupt and it stinks . \nIt has been a total lie from the beginning , we are constantly being lied to and Bush and Blair have to be answerable . \n`` They are just making a bad situation worse and there is no way that it is tolerable . '' \nKeir McKechnie , the secretary of Glasgow 's Stop The War Coalition had traveled down to London overnight . \nHe said there were three coaches from Glasgow , another two from Edinburgh and one from Dundee . \nHe said : `` We have come down here today because we want Tony Blair to know that the anti-war movement has not been kowtowed by his attempts to curb civil liberties . \nEvery single troop has to be brought home safely and not in body bags which is what is happening in Basra . '' \nHe added that ` there has been a watershed over the last week because millions of people now know that it really is a nightmare out there and that if Tony Blair continues to ally himself with Bush he is pulling himself further and further into a conflict that is unwinnable . '' \nSacked Gate Gourmet workers also joined the protest . \nHolding banners declaring : `` Our fight is your fight , '' they repeatedly chanted : `` We want justice : troops out , workers in . '' \nIn Washington tens of thousands are expected today for what is being billed as one of the biggest anti-war protests in the US since the Vietnam era . \nThe figurehead of the United For Peace and Justice Mobilisation is Cindy Sheehan , the mother of a soldier killed in Iraq who set up camp outside George Bush 's ranch in Crawford , Texas , during his summer holiday . \n"}

'' \nThe assault was preceded by eight weeks of aerial bombardment . \nUS troops cut off the city 's water , power and food supplies , condemned as a violation of the Geneva convention by a UN special rapporteur , who accused occupying forces of `` using hunger and deprivation of water as a weapon of war against the civilian population '' . \nTwo-thirds of the city 's 300,000 residents fled , many to squatters ' camps without basic facilities . \nAs the siege tightened , the Red Cross , Red Crescent and the media were kept out , while males between the ages of 15 and 55 were kept in . \nUS sources claimed between 600 and 6,000 insurgents were holed up inside the city - which means that the vast majority of the remaining inhabitants were non-combatants . \nOn November 8 , 10,000 US troops , supported by 2,000 Iraqi recruits , equipped with artillery and tanks , supported from the air by bombers and helicopter gunships , blasted their way into a city the size of Leicester . \nIt took a week to establish control of the main roads ; another two before victory was claimed . \nThe city 's main hospital was selected as the first target , the New York Times reported , `` because the US military believed it was the source of rumors about heavy casualties '' . \nAn AP photographer described US helicopters killing a family of five trying to ford a river to safety . \n`` There were American snipers on top of the hospital shooting everyone , '' said Burhan Fasa'am , a photographer with the Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation . \n`` With no medical supplies , people died from their wounds . \nEveryone in the street was a target for the Americans . '' \nThe US also deployed incendiary weapons , including white phosphorous . \n`` Usually we keep the gloves on , '' Captain Erik Krivda said , but `` for this operation , we took the gloves off '' . \nBy the end of operations , the city lay in ruins . \nFalluja 's compensation commissioner has reported that 36,000 of the city 's 50,000 homes were destroyed , along with 60 schools and 65 mosques and shrines . \nThe US claims that 2,000 died , most of them fighters . \nWhen medical teams arrived in January they collected more than 700 bodies in only one third of the city . \nIraqi NGOs and medical workers estimate between 4,000 and 6,000 dead , mostly civilians - a proportionately higher death rate than in Coventry and London during the blitz . \nThe collective punishment inflicted on Falluja - with logistical and political support from Britain - was largely masked by the US and British media , which relied on reporters embedded with US troops . \nThe BBC , in particular , offered a sanitised version of the assault : civilian suffering was minimized and the ethics and strategic logic of the attack largely unscrutinised . \nFalluja proved to be yet another of the war 's phantom turning points . \nViolent resistance spread to other cities . \nIn the last two months , Tal-Afar , Haditha , Husaybah - all alleged terrorist havens heavily populated by civilians - have come under the hammer . \nFalluja is still so heavily patrolled that visitors have described it as `` a giant prison '' . \nOnly a fraction of the promised reconstruction and compensation has materialised . \nLike Jallianwallah Bagh , Guernica , My Lai , Halabja and Grozny , Falluja is a place name that has become a symbol of unconscionable brutality . \nAs the war in Iraq claims more lives , we need to ensure that this atrocity - so recent , so easily erased from public memory - is recognized as an example of the barbarism of nations that call themselves civilised . \nMike Marqusee is a co-founder of Iraq Occupation Focus Letters for publication should be sent to : letters@guardian.co.uk If you need help using the site : userhelp@guardian.co.uk Call the main Guardian and Observer switchboard : Mike Marqusee : The destruction of Falluja was an act of barbarism that ranks alongside My Lai , Guernica and Halabja This article appeared on p32 of the Main section section of the Guardian on 23.58 GMT on Thursday 10 November 2005 . \nLike a MacBook Pro '' says @Mister_Solomon : Westminster Dog Show - live ! \n"}

'' \nSo , when the Daily Mirror last week published a report , `` Bush plot to bomb his Arab ally '' , which told of a leaked government memo alleging that George Bush planned to bomb al-Jazeera 's headquarters in Qatar , did the government welcome the openness that such scrutiny could bring ? \nInstead the attorney general , Lord Goldsmith , tried to coerce editors into keeping quiet . \nThe memo is said to describe an alleged conversation between Bush and Tony Blair last April , when Bush apparently threatened to use `` military action '' against al-Jazeera . \nThe government could have tried to sue the Daily Mirror for breach of confidence . \nHowever , the newspaper would surely have had a cast-iron public interest defense , so the government chose instead to rely upon the Official Secrets Act . \nUnder section 3 of the OSA , a crown servant is guilty of a criminal offence if he or she makes a damaging disclosure relating to international relations without lawful authority , where they came by that information because of their position in government . \nAlso , under section 5 , a person who receives such information from such a person is guilty of a criminal offence if he or she then discloses it knowing it is protected under the OSA . \nA disclosure is held to be `` damaging '' if it is likely to endanger the interests of the UK abroad , seriously endanger the protection by the UK of those interests or the safety of British citizens abroad . \nAccording to the Daily Mirror report , the memo turned up in the office of the former Labor MP for Northampton South , Tony Clarke . \nA civil servant has been charged under section 3 , and a researcher for Clarke under section 5 , in relation to the leaked memo . \nBut also , Lord Goldsmith is threatening newspaper editors under section 5 if they publish its contents . \nClearly , there is a need for secrecy in relation to genuinely sensitive information which could endanger the UK 's national security or British citizens ' lives . \nHowever , the information apparently contained in this memo clearly raises questions of public interest . \nFor example , whether George Bush was seriously recommending that a news organization located in a US ally 's territory be bombed in order to stop unfavourable coverage of the Iraq war . \nOne wonders whether the prosecutions have more to do with political expediency than a genuine attempt to safeguard the national interest . \nIndeed , it could be suggested that the lack of openness of the government in this case does more harm to national security than good . \nThis potential conflict has been recognized by the courts as long ago as the Spycatcher case in the late 1980s . \nMore recently , Lord Bingham in the David Shayler case stated : `` There can be no government by the people if they are ignorant of the issues to be resolved , the arguments for and against different solutions and the facts underlying those arguments . '' \nThe House of Lords in that case held that there was no public interest defense available under the OSA for members and former members of the security services , but one would expect the strictest restrictions to be imposed on security services personnel . \nThe media are in a different position and thus a public interest defense may apply when journalists are alleged to breach the OSA . \nFor , as the government itself noted , without openness and accountability , the public confidence will disappear . \n"}

{"id": "145", "time": "2005-09-23", "text": "Studies will help scientists tease out problem genes Critics say boundaries being pushed too far Scientists have successfully transplanted human chromosomes into mice , a first that promises to transform medical research into the genetic causes of disease . \nThe mice were genetically engineered to carry a copy of human chromosome 21 , a string of about 250 genes . \nAbout one in a thousand people are born with an extra copy of the chromosome , a genetic hiccup that causes Down 's syndrome . \nGenetic studies of the mice will help scientists to nail down which genes give rise to medical conditions which are prevalent among people with Down 's syndrome , such as impaired brain development , heart defects , behavioural abnormalities , Alzheimer 's disease and leukemia . \nMedical researchers yesterday hailed the work as a `` tour de force '' , but critics accused the team of pushing the boundaries of genetic manipulation too far and blurring the distinction of what was biologically human . \nElizabeth Fisher at the Institute of Neurology and Victor Tybulewicz at the National Institute for Medical Research in London spent 13 years perfecting the technique which is reported in the journal Science today . \nTo create the mice , the team first extracted chromosomes from human cells and squirted them on to beds of stem cells taken from mouse embryos . \nAny stem cells that absorbed human chromosome 21 were injected into three-day-old mouse embryos which were then re-implanted into their mothers . \nThe newly born mice carried copies of the chromosome and were able to pass it on to their own young . \n`` By adding the chromosome , we have mice that show nearly all of the characteristics of Down 's syndrome in humans , '' said Dr Fisher . \n`` It means we can tease out the genes that give rise to the different aspects of Down 's syndrome , because we know we 've got the right genes in there . '' \nAccording to Dr Tybulewicz , genetic tests on the mice , which will systematically knock out different genes on the transplanted chromosome , will help identify which gene or genes cause each of the symptoms common to people with Down 's syndrome . \n`` This should illuminate which genes lead to heart defects , the higher risk of leukemia and early onset Alzheimer 's , '' he said . \nPeter Scambler , a molecular geneticist at the Institute of Child Health in London , said : `` This is a technical tour de force . \nIt 's difficult to envisage how one could otherwise tackle something as complex as Down 's syndrome , because we ca n't go around creating human embryos with the condition . '' \nSteve Brown , director of the Medical Research Council 's mammalian genetics unit , said : `` This will tell us a lot about which genes are key to the myriad abnormalities we associate most with Down 's syndrome . \nWe are taking a step forward in the tools we have to investigate the genetic basis of these conditions . '' \nBut according to David King , of the pressure group Human Genetics Alert , the potential breakthrough comes at too high a cost . \n`` Creating organisms with whole chromosomes from another species is genetic engineering taken to another level . \n`` Before , researchers have said they 're not making big changes because they 're only inserting the odd gene into animals . \nIf you 're talking about creating something with a whole human chromosome in it , you have to ask is this really a mouse any more ? \nIs it starting to be a new species , a hybrid between a mouse and a human ? \nIf more chromosomes are put in , are we going to have to start giving these things pseudo human rights ? '' \nDr King said the research could lead to technologies that would allow humans to be genetically engineered . \n`` Once Britain has a clear ban on human genetic engineering , I 'll be much happier for scientists to do these studies with mice . \nBut they 're developing techniques that could be applied to human beings and , in essence , that leads to a new form of eugenics , '' he said . \nDr Fisher said the transferring of a chromosome was merely a more effective way of swapping large numbers of genes into an animal to benefit medical testing . \n`` We 're not trying to humanise mice , we 're trying to tease out the genetics of a very complex disorder . '' \nDr Tybulewicz added : `` There 's nothing more obviously humanlike about these mice than any others . \nIf you were to see them , you 'd not be able to tell they are different to a normal one .

'' \nThe average age of the Saudis was 17-25 and they were generally middle-class with jobs , though they usually had connections with the most prominent conservative tribes . \n`` Most of the Saudi militants were motivated by revulsion at the idea of an Arab land being occupied by a non-Arab country . \nThese feelings are intensified by the images of the occupation they see on television and the internet ... the catalyst most often cited -LRB- in interrogations -RRB- is Abu Ghraib , though images from Guantnamo bay also feed into the pathology . '' \nIn terms of fighters entering Iraq , Syria is clearly the biggest problem , the report says , but preventing militants from crossing its 380-mile frontier with Iraq is daunting . \n`` Even if Syria had the political will to completely and forcefully seal its border , it lacks sufficient resources to do so .

{"id": "295", "time": "2005-11-17", "text": "A new wave of political bloggers is challenging Britain 's old media pundits . \nBut who are they , and which ones matter ? \nOliver Burkeman reports Political bloggers -LRB- back row , from left -RRB- Perry de Havilland , Adriana Cronin , Oliver Kamm , Mick Fealty and Norman Geras , and -LRB- front row -RRB- Justin McKeating and Tim Ireland . \nPhotograph : Graeme Robertson . \nIn the days after September 11 2001 , a Londoner in his 30s who prefers to be known only as David T made two grim discoveries . \nThe first , and most upsetting , was that a close friend from school had died in the collapse of the World Trade Centre towers . \nThe second discovery - in a way the more disorienting of the two - was what had happened to another former friend . \nIn the years since the two had known each other well , he had become a spokesman for a prominent Islamic fundamentalist organization , and now , in statements to the media , he was openly applauding the attacks . \nDavid T 's experience was hardly typical , of course . \n`` It was the kind of moment where you think : OK , hang on - how do I even begin to make sense of that ? '' \nDavid says today , over bottles of beer in a north London bar . \n`` And that 's what I 've been doing for the last three years , really . '' \nHarry 's Place , the `` blog '' to which he is now a prolific contributor , has become one focus of Britain 's culture of political blogging - regularly updated online journals of opinion and debate - which has burgeoned in the years since 9\\/11 . \nSamizdata , by some measures the nation 's most successful independent blog , claims around 15,000 different visitors a day ; Harry 's Place gets perhaps 9,000 . \nThe phenomenon may not yet have reached the wild heights of the US , where bloggers have claimed credit for several real-world political upsets , including the resignations of the news anchor Dan Rather and the Senate Republican leader Trent Lott . \nBut what has emerged here is a fully fledged alternative wing of the opinion industry , challenging the primacy of newspaper commentators . \nAll political viewpoints thrive within it , but one has become notably prevalent : the stance generally identified as `` pro-war left '' , of which Harry 's Place is an example . \nIt is a line of argument that seems not to have diminished , in stridency or popularity , as the Iraq debacle has worsened . \nExerting influence as a member of this new commentariat is not just a matter of how many readers one attracts ; it 's a question of which ones . \n`` The freakiest thing is when you hear -LRB- a prominent commentator or politician -RRB- quote back a line or a phrase that you 've written , or something from a text you 've brought to light , '' notes Mick Fealty , who runs the non-partisan blog Slugger O'Toole , covering Northern Irish politics . \n`` Just last weekend , I read a whole sentence , in an editorial in one of the Irish Sundays , that I 'd used the Friday before . '' \nSamizdata , arguably the grandfather of British political blogs , is operated from a large and dimly lit flat in a pristine mansion block in south-west London . \nThere are a few computers at the back of the main room , but the dominant feature is a leather-lined drinks bar - installed , according to Samizdata 's founder , Perry de Havilland , by a double agent , who knew the flat 's former owner and who paid for it with money from both MI5 and the KGB . \n-LRB- The flat is also now the headquarters of the Big Blog Company , a consultancy run by some of the Samizdata bloggers , which advises businesses on how to exploit the phenomenon . -RRB- \nA vintage pistol lying on a side-table gives a hint of the Samizdata attitude ; a more modern gun appears in a photograph on the blog 's front page , on top of a copy of The Open Society and Its Enemies , Karl Popper 's anti-totalitarian polemic . \n`` The Samizdata people are a bunch of sinister and heavily armed globalist Illuminati , who seek to infect the entire world with the values of personal liberty and -LRB- private -RRB- property , '' the site says . \nIt was originally named Libertarian Samizdata , but too many of those involved became unhappy with the label : characteristically for libertarians , it seems , they were uncomfortable subscribing to a group ideology . \n`` We are ... a varied group made up of social individualists , libertarians , extropians , futurists , ` Porcupines ' , Karl Popper fetishists , recovering neo-conservatives , crazed Ayn Rand worshippers ... cypherpunks , minarchists , kritarchists and wild-eyed anarcho-capitalists from Britain , North America , Australia and Europe , '' the site now explains , unhelpfully . \nAs I arrive , De Havilland is laughing , nearly hysterically , at a blog by Oliver Kamm , a London hedge-fund manager and member of the `` pro-war left '' who now also writes a column for the Times . \n`` Just marvellous , '' says De Havilland . \n`` I was thinking of making it Samizdata quote of the day . \nIt 's something to the effect that , well , there 's no point in denying that our involvement in Iraq has inflamed -LRB- Islamist totalitarian -RRB- opinion . \nWhy should we deny it ? \nIt 's something we should be proud of ! '' \nSeptember 11 caused many ideological fissures , of course . \nBut it 's a fair bet that the split in British libertarianism - hardly a prominent movement in the first place - is probably one of the least well known . \nSome libertarians opposed any military response to the attacks , on the grounds that armies are tools of governments , and government is largely a bad thing . \nOthers supported the war in Afghanistan , and later the war in Iraq , as attempts to spread or safeguard liberty . \n`` It was between those who said it was just another big-government thing , '' says De Havilland , `` and those who said , ` Excuse me , guys , but these nutjobs are trying to fucking kill us ! ' '' \nSamizdata published its first entry on November 2 2001 . \n`` I look forward to hearing from all those out there in ` establishment punditland ' who sneered at the effect of the US bombing , '' De Havilland wrote in an early posting as he watched the Taliban fall . \n`` Establishment punditland '' was Samizdata 's target from the start . \nIn the US , the birthplace of blog culture , it was easy to see how almost any viewpoints expressed online were going to count as a breath of fresh air . \nAll they needed to do to distinguish themselves was to diverge from the New York Times 's establishment liberalism and from the ranting of rightwing talk radio . \nBritain 's press , by contrast , has long been more politically diverse and unashamedly partisan , which may explain the blogs ' lesser impact here . \nDe Havilland 's collaborator Adriana Cronin , who developed her vociferous views as a reaction to growing up in communist Czechoslovakia , laughs off suggestions that blogs might literally replace the mainstream media , but there is no disguising her passion . \n`` If we had a slogan , it would be , ` We ca n't change the way news is written , but we can change the way people read the news . ' \nSo what we 're saying is - '' `` We 're not competing with newspapers , '' De Havilland interrupts . \n-LRB- This is a habit of his , though it may also be a beneficial quality in a blogger : he is n't willing to wait before sounding off . -RRB- \n`` But I tell you who we are in competition with , 100 % direct competition , and that 's your op-ed writers . \nWe do n't have a reporter in Kandahar , and you might , it 's true - although in time we might have a blogger in Kandahar . \nBut for the moment , sure : if your guy in Kandahar says X blew up Y , then X blew up Y. But when your editorial guy says , ` This is what it means , ' that 's when we say , ` Excuse me ! \nYou 're completely wrong ! ' '' \nAccording to Wikipedia , the communally edited online encyclopedia , the term `` weblog '' was probably coined by the pioneering computer programmer John Barger . \nAs early as December 1997 , Barger began posting brief daily updates to his website , Robot Wisdom , with particular reference to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict - thereby initiating one particular argument that still dominates weblogs today . \nIt was these brief , frequent , personal and opinionated updates that came to define the form . \n`` Blog '' , the shortened version of the word - which also serves as a verb , meaning `` to run a blog '' or `` to add news postings to your blog '' - probably came from one early practitioner , Peter Merholz , who meant it as a joke . \n`` For what it 's worth , I 've decided to pronounce the word ` weblog ' as ` wee-blog ' . \nOr ` blog ' for short , '' he wrote on his site in 1999 . \n`` I did n't think much of it , '' he explained later . \n`` I was just being silly , shifting the syllabic break one letter to the left . \nI started using the word in my posts , and some folks , when emailing me , would use it too . \nI enjoyed its crudeness , its dissonance . '' \nThere was something about the concept that lent itself to strident opinions on current affairs , and quickly , a few figures - the gay conservative British expatriate Andrew Sullivan , for example , and Josh Marshall , of the liberal Talking Points Memo - rose to prominence . \nBroadcasting your opinions is not the only way to blog about politics ; several major UK sites , such as Guido Fawkes and PoliticalBetting , focus either on rumour-mongering or cooler analysis . \nBut the appeal of the form to those with something to get off their chests was clear . \nPosts could be made instantly , within minutes of news events taking place , and could be two or three lines long . \nThere was no need to wait until one had enough material , and time , to assemble a newspaper column - although , for most of the bloggers I spoke to for this article , maintaining their sites seemed to absorb many hours . \n-LRB- The time had to be found where it could ; Oliver Kamm originally blogged in the middle of the night , when he found himself sitting up with his new children , and needed something to do . -RRB- \nThere were other advantages . \nThe old barriers to access - the need to get a job at a newspaper , or a slot on television - did n't exist . \nYou did n't even need to put a name to your views . \n-LRB- David T and `` Harry '' , of Harry 's Place , insist on preserving their anonymity because they do not want to aggravate their employers . -RRB- \nBloggers could link to other bloggers ' postings , to demonstrate their agreement or provide examples of views they despised . \nLater , many sites added the facility for readers to leave comments , often spawning debates that continued long after the bloggers themselves had moved on to other topics . \n-LRB- Amid the flourishing of all this online diversity , certain uniformities emerged . \nOpinionated political blogging frequently resembles a pub rant , and , as such , remains an overwhelmingly male pastime in the UK : Cronin , at Samizdata , and her much-read fellow libertarian Natalie Solent , are rare exceptions . -RRB- \n`` Mainstream media is operating in what I call a channel world , '' says Cronin , whose faith in the transformative power of blogs can sometimes resemble religious zeal . \n`` You 've got certain pipelines that are owned by somebody , and you 've got the content , which is packaged and delivered to the final eyeball . \nBlogs , though , are part of a network world . '' \nThe power of blogs , according to this theory , lies not so much in the persuasive force of any one specific rhetorician , but in the opportunities for connections to be made . \nHundreds of people can quickly `` swarm '' around a particular issue , adapting it to their own purposes . \nHarry 's Place was an important recruiter of canvassers on behalf of Oona King , and against George Galloway , at the last election , while the anti-war site Bloggerheads was instrumental in Backing Blair , a satirical campaign designed to reduce Labor 's 2005 majority via tactical voting . \nOnline , power is the power of crowds ; celebrity becomes dissipated . \n`` On the internet , '' Cronin likes to say , `` everyone is famous for 15 people . '' \nAs you step into Norman Geras 's home , in Manchester 's leafy suburbs , the words `` cutting-edge cyberphenomenon '' do n't immediately spring to mind ; in fact , they never really do , despite his being one of the country 's most influential political bloggers . \nThe retired Manchester university professor of government lives with his wife , a children 's author , in a neatly furnished home , one room of which is densely shelved with books about cricket . \n`` There must be 2,500 of them , '' says Geras , who speaks quietly , with a southern African accent . \n`` Actually , who am I kidding ? \nI 'm quite particular about these things , and I 've counted them : I know there are 2,500 . '' \nAnother bookshelf , by the front door , is filled with nothing but copies of the New Left Review ; Geras is a lifelong marxist who still describes himself as such . \nBut he has also been a key online voice of the `` pro-war left '' - a position born , as for David T , of trying to resolve a serious case of psychological conflict in the months after 9\\/11 . \nHis site , Normblog , arose from a feeling of alienation `` from people I perceived as being in my neck of the woods '' , he says - academic colleagues , friends , and -LRB- a point made frequently by bloggers of Geras 's political persuasion -RRB- writers of articles in the comment pages of the liberal press , including this newspaper . \n`` The next day -LRB- after 9\\/11 -RRB- , or the day after , I open the newspaper and see - within hours - people talking about ` blowback ' , ` comeuppance ' . \nThey did n't even have the sense of horror , of shock , to wait . \nI was just appalled . \nI thought , ` That 's it . ' '' \nHe has blogged every day since July 2003 , with only about seven exceptions , including two Christmases and a spell when he was traveling and could n't get to a computer . \nIn fact , there were plentiful expressions of horror - but it is true that many columnists did not leave the matter there . \n`` It 's not that they do n't say , in a couple of lines at the beginning , that they 're outraged , '' Geras says . \n`` It 's a matter of balance and judgment . \nYou can only judge on the overall balance of what 's said . '' \nHowever justified their sense that their views were being squeezed from mainstream liberal debate , the hawkish left began to flourish online . \nIts members diagnosed what they saw as an unholy alliance between the extremist fringe of Islam and elements of the `` hard left '' . \nA key function of sites such as Normblog became the forensic examination of the work of commentators who claimed to be explaining the reasons for the attacks , but who found themselves accused of trying to justify them . \nOther blogs set out to demolish offending articles by quoting them and then attacking them line by line - a practice that became known as `` fisking '' , a derogatory reference to the Independent writer Robert Fisk , a regular victim of the approach . \n`` Why is it , '' says Geras , `` that the people in our culture are genuine agents , who take criticism for what they do , whereas the terrorists , who come from wherever else , are always somehow effects of somebody else 's actions ? '' \nAs the talk in Washington and London turned from Afghanistan to Iraq , many natural leftwingers who could not resolve mixed feelings about the coming war found themselves visiting Normblog . \n`` It was like a secret handshake - ` Do you read Norm ? ' '' \nis how one journalist puts it . \nHow all these feelings metamorphosed into support for the war is harder to discern : it sometimes seemed as if the leftwing hawks , out of distaste for some aspects of the anti-war lobby , were propelled by magnetic repulsion to a default position of support for the war that did n't always ring true . \nGeras , for his part , supported it on the logic of humanitarian intervention . \nBut does n't the catastrophic state of Baghdad prove that , in this instance at least , they made an error ? \n`` Even if I come to a point where I have to say it was a mistake - and I hope it does n't come to that , but it could happen , say if the whole thing degenerates into a terrible civil war , and even what we 've seen so far is overshadowed - that would be a different thing from saying that the reasons for supporting the war when it happened were wrong , '' Geras says . \n`` I genuinely thought intervention was unlikely to make things worse . \nA lot of antiwar critics say , ` You 're an idiot . \nIt was obvious that it would . ' '' \nSo - has it ? \n`` As of now , I would n't say that . \nAs of now , there 's still a chance for a democratic future for Iraq . '' \nThe July 7 bombings newly energised the `` pro-war left '' , leading to accusations - notably from Madeleine Bunting in this paper - that these `` muscular liberals '' are retreading the `` clash of civilisations '' thesis , giving voice to a kind of liberal fundamentalism as zealous as the religious fundamentalism it sets itself against . \n`` You can hear the creak of the drawbridge being pulled up , '' Bunting wrote . \n`` They believe they are surrounded by enemies - Muslims , and their dastardly non-Muslim apologists - and must defend to the last man the checklist of universal Enlightenment values that sustain their mission . \nTheir most ferocious firepower is directed at former allies whom they regard as yet to see the light . '' \nNot everyone who becomes a political blogger means their blog to start out that way , but the urge frequently proves irresistible . \n`` It took less than a year , '' says Tim Ireland , who works in marketing and runs Bloggerheads , founded in 2002 . \n-LRB- He has designed blogs for the Labor MP Tom Watson and the Tory Boris Johnson . -RRB- \nBy 2003 , Ireland was engaged in a half-serious campaign to force the prime minister to deliver on a promise to set up a publicly accessible email address . \nIn brief , it involved an email address that looked similar to what Blair 's might be , which soon started receiving email intended for the PM . \nHe also used the address to email MPs . \nTen responded to his missive , which , among other things , invited suggestions for names for Blair 's new baby . \n`` I can say with complete confidence that I am the only reason Blair 's email facility was -LRB- eventually -RRB- developed , '' he says . \nThe build-up to the Iraq war , though , added a steelier and angrier edge to Ireland 's campaigning . \nPartly because of the internet , he says , he was exposed to a far wider range of media sources than he might have been had he read a single newspaper , and he concluded that `` I had the facts on my side . \nBlair had to be held accountable , to be shown that to manipulate and exploit the ` war on terror ' for political gain was the wrong thing to do , morally and pragmatically ... eventually I just said , ` Fuck work . ' '' \nHe made sure he looked after his existing clients , `` but the reason I 've been in politics more than marketing , really , is because there are people dying , and that outrages me . '' \nHe channelled his outrage into Backing Blair , which used its ironically pro-Blair stance - its slogan was `` No Alternative '' - to urge tactical anti-Labour voting . \nHalf a million people visited the site , he says , where they found themselves being urged to vote Tory if necessary . \nWas n't that an irresponsible thing to advocate , from a leftwing point of view ? \n`` No way were the Tories going to win , '' Ireland says . \n`` I would have bet my left testicle on it . '' \nSimilar anti-Blair sentiments , meanwhile , were being wittily expressed by Justin McKeating of the Hove-based site Chicken Yoghurt . \nMcKeating spent the run-up to the 2005 general election closely following , and blogging about , the campaign in his constituency , reporting on encounters with candidates and canvassers . \nIt was a version of the `` citizen journalism '' increasingly prevalent in the US that only threw into relief how little of the same seemed to be going on among the British blogs . \nThere are , of course , a thousand other shades of political viewpoint throughout the `` blogo-sphere '' - a word every blogger I spoke to in person grimaced when using , though nobody seemed to have an alternative . \nConservatives can get their fix at two prominent blogs , Conservative Commentary and Blithering Bunny , while the UK Evangelical Blog , run by Adrian Warnock , also figures high in the charts . \nHow much does it all really matter , though ? \nBritain 's bloggers are divided not just by ideology , it turns out , but by their perception of their own importance : while Samizdata proclaims that blogs are the future , for example , Oliver Kamm insists they are an essentially parasitic medium , that can only exist insofar as it feasts on the output of traditional media . \nBut on the subject of motivation , the near-physical urge all the bloggers I spoke to felt - to join the debate , to make waves - seems to have been surprisingly uniform . \n`` I got sick of breaking televisions by throwing things at them , '' is how De Havilland puts it . \n`` If we lived in a world where actual facts could be discussed rationally , I 'd happily disappear back into my cage and sell tat for a living , '' says Tim Ireland . \nBut the drive that he feels , he says , `` will not allow me to shut down until Blair is held accountable '' . \n`` Harry '' , of the eponymous Place , recently announced he would be giving up blogging , for work and family reasons , but David T says he does n't believe him . \n`` He says he 's given up , but he 'll be back , because blogs are like crack and you ca n't quite ever give it up , '' says David . \nOr not like crack , but pornography : `` The internet grew , as so many industries did , because of people 's desire furtively to find pornography , '' he points out . \n`` I sometimes think blogging is the political equivalent to that . '' \nHe spends only a brief time writing his own blog entries , he says - but hours reading through readers ' comments . \n`` That sort of thing can ruin your marriage . \nYou 're never cured - you 're only in remission . \n"}

{"id": "267", "time": "2005-05-27", "text": "Jailed militia leader counselled ex-foes Friday 27 May 2005 00.01 BST When Sheikh Ali Bapir saw his fellow prisoners at the US-run detention center near Baghdad airport he was angry . \nThey were the men he had fought against most of his life . \nNow he was in prison with them . \nHe knew their faces from TV : Ali Hassan al-Majid , aka Chemical Ali , the alleged mastermind of gas attacks on the Kurds and of the brutal suppression of the Shia ; Taha Yassin Ramadan , the former Iraqi vice-president and a confidante of Saddam Hussein ; Tariq Aziz , the former deputy prime minister in the Ba'athist regime ; and Barzan al-Tikriti , Saddam 's half-brother . \nIn the near distance , separated from the others by a barbed wire fence , was Saddam . \nReleased without charge at the end of last month after 22 months in custody , Sheikh Ali , 44 , the leader of the Komala Islami Kurdistan -LRB- Kurdistan Islamic group -RRB- , spoke to the Guardian about his encounters with the former Iraqi leadership . \n`` Why did you put me in here with criminals and mass murderers ? '' \nhe would ask of his interrogators . \n`` I have never been a Ba'athist and I am not a terrorist . \nI even killed my brother because he spied for the Iraqi intelligence . '' \nBut as the weeks progressed , he channelled his rage into pity and became a spiritual guide to the ex-Ba ` athist leaders , teaching them the Qur ` an and leading them in prayer . \n`` At first I was hostile to them , '' he said . \n`` What they did to my people and the Iraqi people in general was not to be forgiven . \nBut they were also in prison and in a weak position . \nIt was my duty under Islam to show mercy , even to these people who had never shown mercy to others . '' \nSheikh Ali was reluctant to talk about individuals but said many of the former leaders looked like `` broken men '' . \nHis sermons and counselling had an effect . \n`` Some of them did recognize their mistakes . \nSome of them told me they would go to their cells and open the Qur ` an and cry because now they made sense of what they did and how horrifying were the results of their actions . '' \nSaddam was in a separate part of the prison , and even though the sheikh could see him , they never spoke . \nBefore the war , Sheikh Ali and his 3,000 followers were based in the Kurdish town of Khormal . \nLike many political leaders who fought against the regime , he also commanded a militia - of about 1,000 men - which controlled a mountain area of north-eastern Iraq close to the Iranian border . \nSheikh Ali opposed terrorism and advocated ties with the west . \nBut his territory abutted the region controlled by the mili tant group Ansar al-Islam . \nSheikh Ali was accused of helping the group by allowing Ansar 's guerrillas to take refuge in his areas . \nIn the first days of the war to remove Saddam , US cruise missiles hit his two-storey compound , killing 43 of his followers and wounding at least 50 . \nThe Americans apologised later but offered no compensation . \nIn July 2003 he arranged to meet US officers at a hotel in the lakeside resort of Dukan to ask for compensation but was arrested on his way there . \nHe was flown to Mosul , where he was told he had been arrested on four counts : of planning to attack US forces ; of helping Ansar al-Islam ; of having links to the previous Ba'athist regime ; and of having relations with Iran . \n`` I told them that the charges were baseless and asked them to produce evidence . \nThey were clearly clueless about my participation in the resistance to Saddam , and about my pronouncements against Ansar , '' he said . \nSheikh Ali had broadly supported the war to remove Saddam . \nFor the first nine days he was interrogated `` perhaps 50 times , day or night '' , after which he was transferred to the prison containing `` high value detainees '' . \nHe said he was tortured but refused to go into details . \n`` I do n't want to explain . \nI will only tell you the consequences of the torture . \nWhen I went to prison my weight was 75kg -LRB- 165lbs -RRB- but after nine days I had lost 15kg . \nand my heartbeat was very quick . \nI told everything to the Red Cross . '' \nHis prison cell was 2.5 metres by 2.5 metres -LRB- 8ft by 8ft -RRB- . \n`` It had a bed , a blanket , a big strong door , and no windows . \nMuch of the time there was no electricity , no lights , '' he said . \n`` At the beginning I spent 23 hours inside my cell . '' \nAfter several months , he was allowed out of his cell for longer periods . \n`` During the break , we would pace along an open-air corridor , '' he said . \n`` For the first four months we were not even allowed to say hello to other prisoners ; we had to keep our distance by a few metres from them . \nIf we broke those rules they would take away our exercise privileges . '' \nLater the rules were relaxed . \n`` They gave us chairs so we could sit next to each other and talk to each other , '' he said . \nHe received his first letter seven months after his arrest but was not allowed a phone call until a year later . \nThere were no newspapers . \n`` We got some information from our guards , '' he said . \n`` For example I knew when Saddam arrived . \nAnd I used to see him when he was being taken to the doctor . \nThe guards told me that he talked big words , but that he was often depressed . '' \nThe Americans gradually began to understand Sheikh Ali was not a security risk and allowed him to teach classes in religion to the other inmates . \nHe described a senior former regime figure who had broken his arm after falling in the shower , and `` was very down , and needed spiritual sustenance '' . \nSome of those he spoke to denied knowledge of the regime 's campaign against the Kurdish areas in the late 1980s , during which 180,000 Kurds were killed . \n`` Some said they did know but it was just a few villages that had been destroyed .

{"id": "59", "time": "2005-05-27", "text": "` Father ' of Malaysia savages Bush and Blair Mahathir brands US a rogue nation terrorising innocents and stands by claim that Jews ` rule the world by proxy ' Mahathir Mohamad , modern Malaysia 's founding father and moderate Islam 's self-styled champion , denounced the Bush administration yesterday as a `` rogue regime '' bent on terrorising innocent civilians . \nHe also said he was disappointed that Tony Blair , who he called a `` proven liar '' , had won re-election after joining the US invasion of Iraq . \nReflecting the rage felt across the Muslim world over abuse scandals in Afghanistan and Guantnamo Bay , and continuing violence in Palestine and Iraq , Mr Mahathir said President George Bush and other US politicians were `` ignorant '' people who believed might made right - a return to colonial-era `` old thinking '' . \nSpeaking to the Guardian at his offices in Putrajaya , near Kuala Lumpur , Mr Mahathir also claimed that the Israeli government had been given a free hand by Washington to continue to expropriate Palestinian land and entrench its control over Jerusalem . \nThe war on terror would not end until the Middle East conflict was justly resolved , he said . \nAsked whether he regretted his statement that `` Jews rule the world by proxy '' , which caused an international furore in 2003 , Mr Mahathir said he took nothing back . \n`` US politicians are scared stiff of the Jews because anybody who votes against the Jews will lose elections . \nThe Jews in America are supporting the Jews in Israel . \nIsrael and other Jews control the most powerful nation in the world . \nAnd that is what I mean -LRB- about Jews controlling the world -RRB- . \nI stand by that view . '' \nOn his balcony overlooking the tower blocks , mosques , bridges and artificial lakes of Putrajaya , Malaysia 's new administrative capital which he created in the 1990s , Mr Mahathir , 79 , cuts a slight , almost self-effacing figure . \nHis personal manner is reserved and courteous to a fault . \nEarlier in the day , he had lectured students at his Perdana Leadership Foundation on the importance of education and development in the Muslim world to defend the Islamic faith . \nThe problem was not Islam itself , he said , but the many incorrect interpreta tions of the Qur ` an that were exploited by extremists . \n`` Islam is a positive , not a negative force . \nToday most Muslim countries seem incapable of developing good governments , they are always fighting each other , assassinating each other and doing all the wrong things . '' \nDistortions of the Prophet 's teachings had held back the peoples of many Muslim countries , he said . \nBut Mr Mahathir 's strongest criticism was directed outwards . \nEven though he retired as Malaysia 's longest-serving prime minister in 2003 , many in the region still regard him as the country 's leader and one of Asia 's most influential voices . \nHis anger is undimmed ; his rhetoric flows unstaunched . \n`` The US is the most powerful nation , '' he said . \n`` It can ignore the world if it wants to do anything . \nIt breaks international law . \nIt arrests people outside their countries ; it charges them under American law . \n`` The US war on terror is a way of terrorising people . \nIf you are an Iraqi and you are expecting to be bombed , are n't you terrified ? \nIf you have done nothing , if you are an innocent Iraqi citizen and you are expecting any time a rocket to fly in and blow you to pieces , are n't you terrified ? \n`` That is terror -LRB- and -RRB- the US is as guilty of terrorism as the people who crashed their planes into the buildings ... Bush does n't understand the rest of the world . \nHe thinks everybody should be a neocon like him . '' \nMr Mahathir was equally scathing about Israeli policies in Palestine . \nHe said his visit to the West Bank last month had been deliberately disrupted by the Israeli government . \nSpecifically , he said he was blocked from traveling to Jerusalem and Jenin , scene of some of the worst Israeli violence in 2002 , where he was to open a school funded by Malaysia . \nIsrael has denied impeding his visit . \n`` I suppose I was mistaken in thinking that there are parts of Palestine that are under the control of the Palestinians . \nBut apparently the Israelis have occupied the whole of Palestine . \nThey do anything they like there , '' he said . \nMr Blair had discredited himself and Britain in Muslim eyes by backing the Iraq war , Mr Mahathir said . \n`` He was wrong and he was more wrong because he tells lies . \nYou know , Jack Straw came to see me -LRB- on the eve of the war in January 2003 -RRB- and I asked him , ` Why are you with the Americans ? ' \nHe said we 're trying to influence the Americans not to take that kind of action . \nBut it seems it was the other way round . \n`` They -LRB- Britain -RRB- were influenced in supporting America to do something that they knew was wrong ... They knew they were being lied to , and yet they supported the Americans and today 300,000 Iraqis are dead because of these lies . \n`` I think a person like Blair would feel very guilty and I am disappointed that the British people would re-elect a person who obviously told lies ... We 're beginning to lose faith in the present leadership of Britain . '' \nOne eventual consequence , he suggested , could be Malaysia 's withdrawal from the Commonwealth . \nMalaysia , which is encircled by conflicts in western Indonesia , the Philippines and southern Thailand , fully supported the fight against religious and political fanaticism , he said . \nBut the west was going about it the wrong way . \n`` Even if you get Bin Laden , you ca n't be sure there wo n't be another Bin Laden . \nYou can not get terrorists to sign a peace treaty . \nThe only way to beat terror is to go for the basic causes . \n`` They do n't blow themselves up for no reason , they 're angry , they 're frustrated . \nAnd why are they angry ? \nLook at the Palestinian situation . \nFifty years after you created the state of Israel , things are going from bad to worse . \n`` If you do n't settle that , there will be no end to the war on terror . \nFor how long are you going to go on examining people 's shoes ? '' \nMahathir Mohamad , 79 . \nMalaysian prime minister , 1981-2003 . \nMost high-profile of many roles is adviser to national car company , Proton , one of the nation 's flagship industrial enterprises . \nFormally eschews limelight , but still regarded as influential political heavyweight . \nSlagging off western nations at every opportunity . \nIgnoring the International Monetary Fund during the 1997 Asian financial crisis . \nAfter ridiculing his policies at the time , the IMF has admitted Mr Mahathir 's action proved extremely effective . \nBringing Formula One motor racing to Malaysia . \nGrand , often wasteful , infrastructure projects . \nThese include the Petronas towers - until 2003 the world 's tallest buildings - and Putrajaya , a , purpose-built capital city . \n"}

{"id": "300", "time": "2005-05-18", "text": "Mr Galloway goes to Washington No new revelations - but do not expect the controversy to go away Wednesday 18 May 2005 01.13 BST George Galloway , then a Labor MP , first went to Iraq 10 years ago . \nUp until then he had been identified as a campaigner for the Palestinian cause . \nAfter his visit to Baghdad he became the most prominent campaigner in the west on behalf of the Iraqi people . \nThat zeal has brought him seemingly endless controversy and yesterday led him to appear in front of a senate hearing . \nThe senators questioned whether he or an Iraq charity he founded had benefited financially from that involvement with Saddam 's regime . \nThe question raised by the senate sub-committee on investigations , led by a Republican , senator Norm Coleman , can be boiled down to a single issue : was Mr Galloway 's 10-year campaign on behalf of the Iraq people motivated , as he says , by his shock at the state of the Iraqi people 's suffering under sanctions or did he become caught up in an intricate financial network set up by Saddam to buy influence in the west ? \nMr Galloway , a newly elected MP for the anti-war Respect party , insists it was entirely altruistic . \nWhat is the background to the hearing ? \nMr Galloway campaigned vigorously on behalf of Iraq from the time of his first visit through to the outbreak of the war two years ago . \nIn 1998 he established the Mariam appeal , initially to help a four-year-old Iraqi girl suffering from leukemia but which broadened into a campaign against sanctions . \nTwo years later a Jordanian businessman , Fawaz Zureikat , was appointed to chair the appeal . \nMr Zureikat had extensive business dealings with Saddam 's Iraq . \nThe Iraq Survey Group published documents last year , which were reproduced again last week by the senate sub-committee , suggesting that Mr Zureikat and Mr Galloway had been allocated millions of barrels of oil by Saddam 's government . \nMr Galloway reiterated yesterday that while his name may have appeared on the documents , he never received anything , not `` even a slim dime '' . \nDid we learn anything new from the senate hearing ? \nThe short answer is no. . \nMr Galloway pointed out various errors in the senate report , such as the investigators mixing up allegations made by the Daily Telegraph with those made by the Christian Science Monitor , which the paper later admitted were based on forgeries . \nMr Galloway also pointed out that he had never met the former vice-president of Iraq Taha Yassin Ramadan , who was quoted in the senate sub-committee report as saying Mr Galloway had been allocated the oil because of his opinions about Iraq . \nThe MP questioned the cred-ibility of Mr Ramadan as a witness , given he was a US prisoner possibly facing a death sentence , and of another unnamed Iraqi source . \nMr Coleman focused on the crux of the allegations : the relationship between Mr Galloway and Mr Zureikat . \nThe Jordanian businessman gave # 375,000 to the Mariam appeal , but there is no evidence that this money came from the oil allocations . \nMr Galloway said he had never received a penny from the Iraqi government or from Mr Zureikat . \nHe knew that Mr Zureikat had business dealings with Iraq but did not know that these involved oil until 2003 . \nMr Coleman challenged Mr Galloway on whether it was credible that he had not discussed the source of the donation to the Mariam appeal with Mr Zureikat . \nDoes the senate hearing mark the end of the affair ? \nMr Galloway is regarded as a minor player in the senate sub-committee 's investig-ation . \nThe main purpose of the investigation is to demonstrate the weakness of the United Nations . \nMr Coleman has already called for the resignation of the organization 's secretary-general , Kofi Annan . \nBut , with so many US Congressional inquiries into Iraq 's finances under Saddam under way and with so many British journalists sore that they have failed to nail Mr Galloway after two decades of controversy , the issue is not going to go away . \nThe relationship between Mr Galloway and Mr Zureikat will continue to be explored , especially if , as Mr Galloway hinted yesterday , his friend is prosecuted . \nMr Coleman , at a press conference after yesterday 's hearing , said there would be `` consequences '' if Mr Galloway was found to have lied to the hearing . \nBut the bottom line , as Mr Galloway pointed out , is that neither the senator nor anyone else was able to provide any evidence in the form of bank accounts or any other pieces of paper to show that Mr Galloway had received any money from Saddam , Mr Zureikat or anyone else linked to Iraq . \n"}
{"id": "316", "time": "2005-05-18", "text": "Surrounded by journalists and politics students , Respect MP turns Washington hearing into an indictment of the invasion of Iraq George Galloway testifies to a US Senate committee . \nPhotograph : Dennis Cook\\/AP George Galloway confronted his accusers in the US senate yesterday , denying any involvement in Iraqi oil trades and using the occasion to unleash an indictment of the war with a stunning ferocity . \nMr Galloway , the newly elected MP for Bethnal Green and Bow , was appearing before the senate investigations sub-committee examining sanctions-busting oil deals in Iraq before the war . \nIn a lengthy preamble before his appearance , senate staff presented a series of documents , enlarged and printed on huge white boards , which they said were Iraqi government memoranda naming Mr Galloway as the recipient of highly lucrative allocations of cheap Iraqi oil under the UN-administered Oil For Food program . \nSenator Norm Coleman , the Republican committee chairman who has taken the lead in making allegations against Mr Galloway , repeatedly insisted that the hearing was `` not a court of law '' . \nBut the early stages were nothing if not lawyerly , with Mr Coleman very much in the role of chief prosecutor . \nIn a low businesslike voice , the senator from Minnesota read out an indictment of Mr Galloway running through the evidence against him . \n`` Senior Iraqi officials have confirmed that you , in fact , received oil allocations and that the documents that identify you as an allocation recipient are valid , '' Mr Coleman said . \n`` If you can provide any evidence that challenges the veracity of these documents or the statements of former Iraqi officials , we 'd welcome that input . '' \nThen it was the Respect party leader 's turn and any sense of judicial propriety was instantly shattered . \nThe courtroom became a vaudeville theater , as the MP lampooned his interrogators , accusing them of making `` schoolboy howler '' mistakes . \nMr Galloway insisted that he was entirely innocent . \n`` Senator , I am not now nor have I ever been an oil trader and neither has anyone on my behalf , '' he declared , in language that deliberately echoed that of Joe McCarthy 's anti-communist witch-hunt conducted half a century ago just metres from the chamber used for yesterday 's hearing . \n`` I have never seen a barrel of oil , owned one , bought one , sold one , and neither has anybody on my behalf , '' he said . \nThe wide , wood-panelled room was packed with journalists and spectators . \nA group of politics students stood at the back . \nThe turnout among senators was less spectacular , however . \nOnly four appeared for the start of the hearing . \nBy the time Mr Galloway took the microphone , there were only two left , Mr Coleman and Carl Levin , the leading Democrat on the panel . \nWitnesses in this August setting , a little below and surrounded by the horseshoe bench of powerful senators , are usually awed and almost always on the defensive . \nMr Galloway was on the attack from the first moment . \nHe entered the hearing room with guns blazing , telling journalists his inquisi tors were `` crazed '' , `` pro-war '' , `` lickspittles '' of the president , and predicting he would turn the tables on them . \n`` I want to put these people on trial . \nThis group of neo-cons is involved in the mother of smokescreens , '' he said . \nThat was the common theme in a feat of bare-knuckled rhetoric not often witnessed by the senators , who are accustomed to considerably more reverence for their positions . \nCNN called it a `` blistering attack on senators rarely heard or seen on Capitol Hill '' . \nMr Galloway deflected every charge against him and flung it back at the Bush administration and the US congress . \nFor example , he denied the committee 's claim that he had met Saddam many times , claiming there had only been two such meetings - and that the US defense secretary , Donald Rumsfeld , had met the then Iraqi president the same number of times , to sell arms , Mr Galloway said . \n`` Now , you have nothing on me , senator , except my name on lists of names from Iraq , many of which have been drawn up after the installation of your puppet government in Baghdad . '' \nThe senators mostly soaked up the punches , reserving judgment until a press conference later , when Mr Coleman claimed Mr Galloway 's credibility was `` very , very suspect '' . \nIn the hearing , however , the senators struggled to pin Mr Galloway down with Iraqi oil sales documents with his name on them . \n`` What counts is not the names on the paper ; what counts is where is the money , senator ? '' \n`` Who paid me hundreds of thousands of dollars of money ? \n`` The answer to that is nobody . \nAnd if you had anybody who ever paid me a penny , you would have produced them here today . '' \nA jubilant Mr Galloway later told an American television interviewer that it marked a victory for the `` British parliamentary style '' over the more sedate senate . \nMr Galloway used anti-war rhetoric far more raw than most politicians are accustomed to in America , where shared patriotism normally trumps outrage . \nHe said that 100,000 people had paid with their lives for false assumptions on Iraq , `` 1,600 of them American soldiers sent to their deaths on a pack of lies ; 15,000 of them wounded , many of them disabled forever on a pack of lies '' . \nIn their cross-examination , the senators focused on Mr Galloway 's relationship with Fawaz Zureikat , a Jordanian businessmen with extensive dealings in pre-war Iraq who served as chairman of and as principal contributor to Mr Galloway 's charity , the Mariam Appeal . \nThey suggested Mr Zureikat had been oil trading in his name , and the MP must have known about it . \nOnce more , the accused sought to turn the tables on his accusers . \nWhen Mr Coleman asked how he could have failed to be aware of Mr Zureikat 's oil deals , Mr Galloway turned the attention to Mr Coleman 's campaign fundraising . \nHe said : `` Well , there 's a lot of contributors , I 've just been checking your website ... '' `` Not many at that level , Mr Galloway , '' the senator interjected . \n`` No , let me assure you there are , '' Mr Galloway went on . \n`` I 've checked your website . \nThere are lots of contributors to your political campaign funds , I do n't suppose you ask any of them how they made the money they give you . '' \nMr Coleman stuck to his task . \n`` If I can get back to Mr Zureikat one more time , do you recall a time when you specifically had a conversation with him about oil dealings in Iraq ? '' \n`` I 've already answered that question , '' Mr Galloway replied . \n`` I can assure you , Mr Zureikat never gave me a penny from an oil deal , from a cake deal , from a bread deal or from any deal . '' \nHe danced around many of the questions , frequently responding , `` I can do better than that '' and answering a slightly different question . \nHis biggest stumble came when he mistakenly assumed Mr Levin had backed the war . \nMr Levin 's investigation of the US government 's own failure to police sanctions provided Mr Galloway ammunition for his counter-attack . \nBut he made no more headway than his Republican counterpart in his cross-examination of the witness . \nWhen Mr Levin invited Mr Galloway to say whether he was alleging the documentary evidence was forged , the British MP replied : `` Well , I have no way of knowing , sir . '' \n`` That 's fine . \nSo you 're not alleging , '' Mr Levin persisted . \n`` I have no way of knowing . '' \n`` Is it fair to say , since you do n't know , you 're not alleging ? '' \n`` Well , it would have been nice to have seen it before today , '' Mr Galloway said . \nThe minuet of exchanges played on for another few minutes before the senators gave up frustrated . \nThey had come equipped for a trial and found themselves in the role of stooges for a man accustomed to playing to the gallery . \n"}

'' Eventually Mr Hitchens gave up . \n`` You 're a real thug , are n't you ? '' \nhe hissed , stalking away . \nIt was a hint of what was to come : not so much political theater as political bloodsports - and with the senators , at least , it was Mr Galloway who emerged with the flesh between his teeth . \n`` I know that standards have slipped in Washington in recent years , but for a lawyer , you 're remarkably cavalier with any idea of justice , '' he told Norm Coleman , the Minnesota Republican who chairs the senate investigations committee , after taking his seat at the front of the high-ceilinged hearing room , and swearing an oath to tell the truth . \n`` I 'm here today , but last week you already found me guilty . \nYou traduced my name around the world without ever having asked me a single question . '' \nThe culture clash between Mr Galloway 's bruising style and the soporific gentility of senate proceedings could hardly have been more pronounced , and drew audible gasps and laughs of disbelief from the audience . \n`` I met Saddam Hussein exactly the same number of times as Donald Rumsfeld met him , '' Mr Galloway went on . \n`` The difference is that Donald Rumsfeld met him to sell him guns , and to give him maps the better to target those guns . '' \nAmerican reporters seemed as fascinated as the British media : at one point yesterday , before it was his turn to speak , Mr Galloway strode from the room , sending journalists of all nationalities rushing after him - only to discover that he was going to the lavatory . \nBy condemning him in their report without interviewing him , the senators had already given Mr Galloway the upper hand . \nBut not everything was in his favor . \nFor a start , only two senators were present , sabotaging Mr Galloway 's efforts to attack the whole lickspittle lot of them - and one of the two , the Democrat Carl Levin , had spent much of his opening statement attacking the hypocrisy of the US government in allegedly allowing American firms to benefit from Iraqi oil corruption . \nEven so , Mr Galloway was in his element , playing the role he relishes the most : the little guy squaring up for a fight with the establishment . \nFor these purposes , Senator Coleman served symbolically to represent all the evil in the world - the entire Republican party , the conscience of George Bush , the US government and the British government , too : no wonder his weak smile looked so nauseous . \n`` I gave my heart and soul to stop you committing the disaster that you did commit in invading Iraq ... senator , in everything I said about Iraq , I turned out to be right and you turned out to be wrong , '' Mr Galloway told him . \nAnd yet for all his anti-establishment credentials , Mr Galloway is as practiced as any of his New Labor enemies at squirming away from awkward questions . \nUnder scrutiny by Senator Levin , he deployed a classic example of the bait-and-switch technique that is the government minister 's best defense in difficult questioning . \nBut Mr Galloway Goes To Washington had never really been an exercise in clarifying the facts . \nIt was an exercise in giving Norm Coleman , and , by extension , the Bush administration , a black eye - mere days after the bloody nose that the Respect MP took credit for having given Tony Blair . \nAnd it went as well as Mr Galloway could have wished . \nLike a MacBook Pro '' says @Mister_Solomon : Westminster Dog Show - live ! \n"}

Mr Sevan 's lawyer , Eric Lewis , accused Mr Volcker 's committee of trying to `` scapegoat '' him . \nIn an attempt to curry favor and end sanctions , Saddam Hussein gave former government officials , activists , journalists and UN officials vouchers for Iraqi oil that could then be resold at a profit . \nMr Volcker 's report found `` convincing and uncontested evidence '' that selection of the three UN contractors for the oil-for-food program did not conform to established financial and competitive bidding rules . \nMr Annan has said that if any of Mr Volcker 's findings lead to criminal charges , he would cooperate with national law enforcement authorities and lift diplomatic immunity . \n"}

'' \nThe militants did not threaten to kill the election workers . \nThe election will be Iraq 's first multi-party poll in half a century . \nVoters will elect a 275-member assembly that will pick Iraq 's new transitional government and draft a permanent constitution . \nThe prime minister , Tony Blair , today indicated that Britain and the US could begin handing over large parts of Iraq to the country 's security forces after the election . \nMr Blair told the Financial Times that Washington and London were set to agree `` timelines '' with the new government indicating the pace at which Iraqi forces could take over less difficult areas . \n`` Both ourselves and the Iraqis want us to leave as soon as possible . \nThe question is , what is as soon as possible ? \nAnd the answer is when the Iraqi forces have the capability to do the job , '' he said . \n`` There are areas where we would be able to hand over to those Iraqi forces . \nRemember , 14 out of the 18 provinces in Iraq are relatively peaceful and stable .

'' \nHe goes on retreat to Iona every year and he has always been a socialist , he says . \n`` Socialism and Catholicism go hand in hand . '' \nIs n't the title Public Interest Lawyers - the firm has just six employees , including three solicitors - a bit presumptuous ? \nShiner replies that he is not out to define the public interest ; rather , to make the point that there is a strong public-interest component to the cases - and causes - he takes on . \nFor many human rights lawyers , a lot of the issues he tackles are pretty unfashionable . \nTake some of his environmental cases . \nThey include damage done by incinerators burning hazardous or dangerous substances , landfills , open-cast coal schemes , quarries , chemical plants , inappropriately sited mobile-phone masts , and industrial or commercial developments on greenfield land . \n`` Litigation through judicial review is a relatively blunt instrument , '' says his firm 's website . \n`` We aim for a preventative approach to these polluting developments . \nWe are not personal injury lawyers who act to sue for damages once a project has caused harm to public health and the environment . '' \nIt continues : `` PIL try to take pre-emptive action , that is , to make representations to a decision-maker prior to a decision being made , say , to grant planning permission for a particular project . \nIn that way we feed our legal representations into the broader political process so that an authority might be persuaded not to grant consent at all . \nFor example , if an incinerator is unacceptable to the local community because of the increased levels of prescribed pollutants , it is better to persuade a local planning authority of that than expect a judge on judicial review to enter the debate as to whether that is or is not acceptable . \nMany of our successes have been in persuading public bodies to refuse consent for polluting projects so that , once the developer decides not to appeal , the community can close the book on the problem . '' \nShiner also takes on nuclear power - every aspect of it . \nTomorrow , he is appealing against the refusal of legal aid for a case to decide whether the nuclear weapons facility at Faslane in Scotland should abide by the Radioactive Substances Act , an issue , he says , which is important for the local community . \nThe nuclear weapons plant at Aldermaston in Berkshire , and the naval dockyard at Devonport , the navy 's nuclear submarine base , should also be subject to extra safeguards , he says . \nHe is taking comfort from the decision by the European Commission to seek a ruling from the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg that health and safety rules should apply to military as well as civil sites . \nShiner has pursued equally strenuously the issue of the legality of nuclear weapons and Britain 's special nuclear weapons relationship with the United States . \nHe acted for CND - with Rabinder Singh QC , a founding member of Matrix barristers ' chambers with Tony Blair 's wife , Cherie Booth QC - in an unsuccessful attempt to persuade the high court to rule on whether the invasion of Iraq was legal . \nHe believes the use of cluster bombs is an issue that should be heard by the International Criminal Court . \nAnd he is now preparing a case on behalf of Quakers and others , arguing that they should not have to pay the part of their taxes which is spent on armaments and warfare . \nUnsurprisingly , he is not the most Ministry of Defense 's most popular lawyer . \nLast year , he threatened a judicial review of the prime minister 's decision to give ex-Gurkhas the right of abode in Britain , but only those who had recently left the regiment . \nThe government gave way and Geoff Hoon , the defense secretary , has now announced a full review of the terms and conditions of service of all Gurkhas . \nIt is not the first time that Shiner has taken up the Gurkhas ' cause . \nHe says one of his high points is winning the argument , in the high court and then the court of appeal , that ex-Gurkhas captured by the Japanese should be given a # 10,000 ex gratia payment on a par with other armed services inmates of the wartime concentration camps . \nSome 1,000 Gurkhas and their families benefited . \nA `` low moment '' was his decision to seek evidence from Iraqi families whose relatives , allegedly , had been killed , mistreated or even tortured by British troops in southern Iraq after the last Iraq war was declared over . \nThe high-profile case provoked huge controversy . \n`` Anyone Else Want to Sue ? '' \nthe Daily Mail asked last year in a banner headline . '' \n` Murder ' Slur on Our Soldiers '' , it declared , adding : `` Solicitor who yesterday accused British troops of murder went touting for clients in Iraq - and , yes , you 've guessed it , wants legal aid , too . '' \nThe newspaper published a cartoon of a large Iraqi at dinner with his wife , reading a phrasebook , a solicitor hanging upside down from a rafter in the background . \n`` I 've just worked out what he said after ` I 'm English ' , '' she says . \n`` It was : ` Do you want to sue anybody ? ' '' \nShiner received a number of death threats as a result of his work on this case . \n`` You 're doing it for Muslims , and Arabs , and other dirty Iraqi bastards , '' said one . \nHe was sent packets of white powder . \nThat was not all . \nThe Legal Services Commission launched an investigation over allegations that he touted for business . \nThe pressure was so great , Shiner says , that he almost felt that he could not go ahead with his marriage to Rachel , his second wife . \n`` For three hours , I thought , ' I ca n't do this . \nThis is too much . ' '' \nThen , in December , Shiner , who is now acting for some 40 Iraqi families , won his case . \nIn a landmark judgment , the high court ruled that British troops on foreign operations are bound by the European Convention on Human Rights , which bans torture and inhuman or degrading treatment of prisoners . \nSpecifically , it ruled that the convention extended to a prison in Iraq where Baha Mousa , a hotel receptionist , died last year while in the custody of British soldiers . \nIn what Lord Justice Rix and Mr Justice Forbes called a `` difficult and troubling case '' , the judges said that British troops were `` in effective control '' of the prison where Mousa died . \nThe MoD is appealing against the judgment . \nClare Dodgson , the Legal Services Commission 's chief executive , trumpeted the commission 's part in funding the case , describing the judgment as a `` historic legal ruling '' . \nThough it carried no implication of guilt or wrongdoing by British soldiers , she said , it allowed for allegations surrounding deaths in custody to be `` fairly and independently investigated '' . \nMeanwhile , the commission is still looking into the allegations against the lawyer who brought this historic case to court . \nShiner describes the support he has received from his peers as phenomenal . \nHe is fighting in an honorable lawyers ' tradition , he says - `` guilty of pursuing cases in a single-minded way and upsetting powerful people '' . \n"}

{"id": "171", "time": "2005-02-01", "text": "The Vietnam turnout was good as well No amount of spin can conceal Iraqis ' hostility to US occupation Tuesday 1 February 2005 02.38 GMT On September 4 1967 the New York Times published an upbeat story on presidential elections held by the South Vietnamese puppet regime at the height of the Vietnam war . \nUnder the heading `` US encouraged by Vietnam vote : Officials cite 83 % turnout despite Vietcong terror '' , the paper reported that the Americans had been `` surprised and heartened '' by the size of the turnout `` despite a Vietcong terrorist campaign to disrupt the voting '' . \nA successful election , it went on , `` has long been seen as the keystone in President Johnson 's policy of encouraging the growth of constitutional processes in South Vietnam '' . \nThe echoes of this weekend 's propaganda about Iraq 's elections are so close as to be uncanny . \nWith the past few days ' avalanche of spin , you could be forgiven for thinking that on January 30 2005 the US-led occupation of Iraq ended and the people won their freedom and democratic rights . \nThis has been a multi-layered campaign , reminiscent of the pre-war WMD frenzy and fantasies about the flowers Iraqis were collecting to throw at the invasion forces . \nHow you could square the words democracy , free and fair with the brutal reality of occupation , martial law , a US-appointed election commission and secret candidates has rarely been allowed to get in the way of the hype . \nIf truth is the first casualty of war , reliable numbers must be the first casualty of an occupation-controlled election . \nThe second layer of spin has been designed to convince us that an overwhelming majority of Iraqis participated . \nThe initial claim of 72 % having voted was quickly downgraded to 57 % of those registered to vote . \nSo what percentage of the adult population is registered to vote ? \nThe Iraqi ambassador in London was unable to enlighten me . \nIn fact , as UN sources confirm , there has been no registration or published list of electors - all we are told is that about 14 million people were entitled to vote . \nAs for Iraqis abroad , the up to 4 million strong exiled community -LRB- with perhaps a little over 2 million entitled to vote -RRB- produced a 280,000 registration figure . \nOf those , 265,000 actually voted . \nThe Iraqi south , more religious than Baghdad , responded positively to Grand Ayatollah al-Sistani 's position : to call the bluff of the US and vote for a list that was proclaimed to be hostile to the occupation . \nSistani 's supporters declared that voting on Sunday was the first step to kicking out the occupiers . \nThe months ahead will put these declarations to a severe test . \nMeanwhile Moqtada al-Sadr 's popular movement , which rejected the elections as a sham , is likely to make a comeback in its open resistance to the occupation . \nThe big vote in Kurdistan primarily reflects the Kurdish people 's demand for national self-determination . \nThe US administration has hitherto clamped down on these pressures . \nHenry Kissinger 's recent proposal to divide Iraq into three states reflects a major shift among influential figures in the US who , led by Kissinger as secretary of state , ditched the Kurds in the 70s and brokered a deal between Saddam and the Shah of Iran . \nGeorge Bush and Tony Blair made heroic speeches on Sunday implying that Iraqis had voted to approve the occupation . \nThose who insist that the US is desperate for an exit strategy are misreading its intentions . \nThe facts on the ground , including the construction of massive military bases in Iraq , indicate that the US is digging in to install and back a long-term puppet regime . \nFor this reason , the US-led presence will continue , with all that entails in terms of bloodshed and destruction . \nIn the run-up to the poll , much of the western media presented it as a high-noon shootout between the terrorist Zarqawi and the Iraqi people , with the occupation forces doing their best to enable the people to defeat the fiendish , one-legged Jordanian murderer . \nIn reality , Zarqawi-style sectarian violence is not only condemned by Iraqis across the political spectrum , including supporters of the resistance , but is widely seen as having had a blind eye turned to it by the occupation authorities . \nSuch attitudes are dismissed by outsiders , but the record of John Negroponte , the US ambassador in Baghdad , of backing terror gangs in central America in the 80s has fuelled these fears , as has Seymour Hirsh 's reports on the Pentagon 's assassination squads and enthusiasm for the `` Salvador option '' . \nAn honest analysis of the social and political map of Iraq reveals that Iraqis are increasingly united in their determination to end the occupation . \nWhether they participated in or boycotted Sunday 's exercise , this political bond will soon reassert itself - just as it did in Vietnam - despite tactical differences , and despite the US-led occupation 's attempts to dominate Iraqis by inflaming sectarian and ethnic divisions . \nSami Ramadani was a political refugee from Saddam Hussein 's regime and is a senior lecturer at London Metropolitan University Letters for publication should be sent to : letters@guardian.co.uk If you need help using the site : userhelp@guardian.co.uk Call the main Guardian and Observer switchboard : This article was published on guardian . \n"}

'' \nThe BBC head of political programs , Sue Inglish , defended Paxman , saying that he opened the Galloway interview with a question about Ms King 's race because a studio guest , former Labor MP Tony Banks , had just raised it . \n`` Some people found Jeremy Paxman 's line of questioning insensitive but , having reviewed the interview in the cold light of day , I do not agree , '' Ms Inglish said . \n`` Jeremy Paxman is renowned for his vigorous questioning and so the directness of the question can hardly have come as a surprise to Mr Galloway . \nThat Mr Galloway chose not to take the opportunity he was being offered to say that neither race nor religion nor sex was the issue is a matter for him , but it was a pertinent question to ask . \n`` It was Mr Banks who brought up questions of ethnicity and gender ... When Jeremy Paxman very shortly afterwards had a chance to interview George Galloway , the question he asked was one that many in the audience must at that point have had at the front of their minds ; did Mr Galloway feel uncomfortable about unseating one of the few black women MPs ? \n`` The interview only became bogged down on this issue because George Galloway preferred not to answer the question and move on to other matters . \nHowever , Jeremy Paxman did explore the issue of Labor unpopularity as a result of the Iraq war in comparative depth in his interview with Labor 's David Lammy , immediately after the abortive exchange with George Galloway . '' \nDuring the interview , Mr Galloway , speaking on a link from the Bethnal Green and Bow constituency in east London , repeatedly refused to answer Paxman 's opening question and instead challenged the Newsnight presenter to congratulate him on his victory . \nEventually he retorted : `` All those New Labor MPs who voted for Mr Blair and Mr Bush 's war have on their hands the blood of 100,000 people in Iraq , many of them British soldiers , many of them American soldiers , most of them Iraqis . \n`` That is a more important issue than the color of her skin . \nSo do n't try and tell me I should feel guilty about one of the most sensational election results in modern electoral history . '' \nHe accused Mr Paxman of `` insulting '' his new constituents by ignoring the result . \n`` They chose me . \nCa n't you find it within yourself even to congratulate me ? '' \nhe asked , before terminating the interview . \nWith that the MP stormed off , to which Paxman responded with a bout of his trademark eye-rolling . \nThe BBC has also admitted it had too many under-35s in the audience for the Question Time election special on Thursday April 28 , in which Tony Blair , Michael Howard and Charles Kennedy were quizzed in turn by people in the studio . \nMore than 70 people called the BBC to complain that there were too many young people in the audience for it to be representative . \n`` Looking back at the program I think that we got most of the balances pretty well right . \nHowever , I think we were probably under-representative among older people , I accept that , '' said Ric Bailey , the Question Time executive editor . \n`` But I think we did achieve a very lively program in which there was lots of young people who contributed their views and a few older people as well .

'' \n`` I hope that situation never arises in our country , '' he said . \n`` Maybe the film will awaken people to this danger . '' \nAsked whether Star Wars Episode III openly alluded to the Iraq war , he said : `` When I wrote it Iraq did n't exist . \nWe were funding Saddam Hussein and giving him weapons of mass destruction . \nWe were going after Iran . \nBut the parallels between what we did in Vietnam and what we are doing in Iraq are unbelievable . '' \nLucas yesterday received , amid enormous hoopla , one of the highest honors Cannes can bestow : the Trophy of the Festival , which he was awarded on the world 's largest ocean liner , the Queen Mary 2 . \nHis film was screened out of competition at Cannes before its London premiere tonight . \nLucas said : `` I am happy the film does n't have to compete -LRB- for the Palme D'Or -RRB- , because it probably would n't win . '' \nBut he was bullish about the tepid critical reception of the more recent Star Wars films . \n`` I see it all as one movie ; I do n't pay much attention whether people like individual chapters or not , '' he said . \n`` There are two groups of fans for my films : one group over 25 , and the other under 25 . \nThe people in their 30s and 40s love the first three , and they are in control of the media and the web . \n`` The more recent ones are fantastically adored by people under 25 and the devotion of each group is about equal ... but one group can express themselves more loudly than the others . \n`` It will be interesting to see what happens in 10 years when the younger group has grown older .

'' \nMajor Taylor was expected to give evidence to the hearing in Osnabruck , northern Germany , later today . \nSpeaking yesterday Lieutenant Colonel Nick Clapham , prosecuting , said Major Taylor 's order was in breach of the Geneva Convention . \nCpl Kenyon pleaded not guilty yesterday to six charges , including aiding and abetting a person to force two naked detainees to simulate a sex act and failing to report the alleged abuse . \nToday Mr Giret told the panel of seven officers who are trying the soldiers that Cpl Kenyon had been described as a `` war hero '' who had saved soldiers ' lives in the conflict . \nThe photographs , taken two weeks after the fall of Saddam Hussein 's regime , prompted comparisons with those showing US troops abusing detainees at Abu Ghraib prison outside Baghdad which caused international outrage . \nAs well as showing forced simulation of sexual acts , some also depict British soldiers allegedly pretending to punch and kick bound men and a prisoner tied to the raised tines of a forklift truck . \nIn the Commons this morning , the prime minister , Tony Blair , said that while there was disgust at the `` shocking and appalling '' images , he hoped that the proceedings in Germany would `` indicate we do not tolerate this type of activity in any shape or form '' . \nIn Germany , the court has heard that the Ali Baba operation began at daybreak on May 15 2003 with more than 100 British soldiers patrolling the camp in groups of four to six . \nA number of looters were caught and forced to carry back the aid they had stolen . \nThey were then broken up into groups and distributed between the servicemen to be `` worked hard '' by carrying out menial tasks at the camp . \nA section run by Cpl Kenyon was given three or four Iraqis to detain and work and a short time later the scenes in the photographs occurred . \nThe other men facing court martial are Lance Corporal Darren Larkin , 30 , from Oldham , Greater Manchester , and Lance Corporal Cooley , 25 , from Newcastle upon Tyne . \nL\\/Cpl Larkin yesterday admitted one charge of assaulting an unknown male at the camp , but pleaded not guilty to a charge of indecent conduct for allegedly forcing two Iraqi detainees to undress in front of others . \nOne of the released photographs shows L\\/Cpl Larkin wearing shorts and flip-flops standing on top of a bound Iraqi . \nL\\/Cpl Cooley denied three charges , including placing an unknown Iraqi captive on a forklift and also `` simulating '' punching and kicking a detainee while someone else took photographs . \nThe court heard yesterday that L\\/Cpl Cooley admitted driving the truck but claimed it was `` to move the man out of the sun '' . \nThe court heard today that all the accused were briefed on the law of armed conflict and prisoner of war handling , according to army records . \nThe army 's senior legal adviser in Iraq , Lieutenant Colonel Nicholas Mercer , told the hearing his orders had made it clear how detainees should be treated . \nHe said that the Geneva Convention only allowed photographs of prisoners of war to be taken for the purpose of identification and that photographing civilian detainees had to be `` humane and dignified '' . \nThe photographs came to light after a film was taken to be developed at a high street shop in Britain by Fusilier Gary Bartlam , who was convicted of a number of offences in connection with them last week . \nDetails of his case can not be fully reported because of reporting restrictions imposed by Judge Advocate Michael Hunter , who is sitting on the hearing 's panel . \nThe hearing , which is expected to last up to four weeks , continues . \nup to four weeks , continues . \n"}

'' \nHe said the soldiers had taken the men to their `` hide '' location at the far end of the camp to undertake `` menial tasks '' . \nWhile there , the unknown Iraqis were forced to undress and perform simulated sexual acts while being photographed . \nOne was beaten and suspended from a forklift truck . \nWith regard to the pictures depicting sexual acts , he commented : `` I do not say that the act of oral sex is actually taking place . \nIt is very close but it has n't got to that stage . '' \nThe abused Iraqis pictured never came forward and the allegations only came to light when another fusilier , Gary Bartlam , 20 , took his film to be processed at a shop in his home town of Tamworth . \nPolice were called and the soldier was arrested . \nHe was recently convicted at a separate court martial , the details of which can not be revealed because of reporting restrictions imposed by Judge Advocate Michael Hunter who is also sitting on the current panel . \nThe army 's legal adviser during the war , Lieutenant-Colonel Nicholas Mercer , told the court it had been made `` absolutely clear '' to soldiers that they must `` treat persons who fall into their power humanely and protect them from the dangers of war '' . \nHe said that looting in Iraq was `` epidemic and psychotic '' but soldiers had been briefed that prisoners should either be released or handed over to the Royal Military Police as soon as possible . \nThe soldiers face a maximum of two years in prison for each of the charges apart from the lesser charge of battery . \n"}

'' \nHe spoke out as the Ministry of Defense said it was unable to provide details of serious injuries sustained by 790 British troops evacuated since the invasion of Iraq . \nTheir injuries were as a result of `` hostile actions , accidents , and other incidents '' , Ivor Caplin , the junior defense minister , told MPs earlier this month . \nMr Solomou describes an atmosphere of restlessness over Iraq in the increasingly deployed reservist TA , saying : `` I want to act as a beacon for other soldiers to come out and say they are against the war , or at least that they are not prepared to go . \nThere are so many more soldiers out there who believe what I believe . \n`` I have always wanted to be a soldier and I still want to be a soldier , '' he added . \n`` But I want to be used in the correct manner . \nWe are not just pieces of flesh to be moved about on a chessboard . '' \nMr Solomou , 38 , a worker for the emergency services in east London , said he had always opposed the war in Iraq , and had marched against it in February 2003 with a group of TA colleagues . \nCiting his objections yesterday , he said : `` I believe the occupation of Iraq to be illegal . \nThey have tried everything - weapons of mass destruction , the connection to al-Qaida - none of it was true . \n`` Now the fundamental bedrocks of democracy are being trampled by this war , with the American treatment of prisoners . \nAdded to that , the Iraqis can see oil tanker after oil tanker coming out of Iraq while they have n't even got electricity . \nThis war is a turning point in history and is about America setting itself on a course to control the world 's petroleum . '' \nMr Solomou started his TA career as an infantryman , but transferred to the Royal Army Medical Corps attached to the London Irish Rifles . \nHe will present his case at a press conference at Westminster today , convened by Military Families Against the War , and led by Rose Gentle from Glasgow , whose 19-year-old son Gordon was killed in Iraq in June last year . \nMost of the 790 injuries sustained by British service personnel since March 2003 were caused by shrapnel , defense sources suggested yesterday . \nThe MoD said it could not give any further information . \nIt is known that a number have had limbs amputated . \nThey include two Royal Signals soldiers who lost their legs in a suicide bomber attack on the Black Watch battlegroup south of Baghdad in November . \nSeveny-three members of the armed forces have been killed in Iraq , more than half the result of accidents and , in at least one case , suicide , according to the latest MoD figures on fatalities . \nMr Caplin also told MPs earlier this month that there are about 400 British military medical personnel in Iraq , including surgeons , dentists , physiotherapists and mental health specialists . \nIn separate parliamentary answers , the Foreign Office minister , Bill Rammell , said the government had `` no reliable of ascertaining the number of Iraqi civilians injured by military or terrorist action '' since May 2003 . \nBut he said that according to the Iraqi health minister , figures based on records from some 180 hospitals , showed that between April and October last year 15,517 Iraqi civilians were injured , and 3,853 killed . \n"}
{"id": "84", "time": "2005-01-19", "text": "Julia Roberts has a better chance of winning this war Iraq will surrender its soul to America only when the US army has left Wednesday 19 January 2005 00.02 GMT There is growing dissension and dismay in the US armed forces about their prospects of victory in Iraq . \nThe yellow ribbons , lapel pins and yard signs expressing solidarity with the nation 's soldiers are still conspicuous around army bases across America . \nBut commanders and soldiers alike are conducting an increasingly anguished debate . \nThere are four reasons for this . \nFirst , many service people are shocked by the incontrovertible evidence that the justifications offered by the Bush administration for invading Iraq - WMD and a link with international terrorism - were false . \nSecond , bitter and painful fighting , notably in the showpiece assault on Falluja , has failed to suppress insurgency . \nThird , there is deep scepticism about progress in recruiting Iraqis to assume the security burden . \nEven General David Petraeus , the US airborne general charged with organising Iraq 's new forces , is said to be increasingly despondent . \nAnd finally , the army and marine corps are acutely aware that they have to sustain the occupation without sufficient troops to control the country effectively . \nHaving begun the campaign convinced of the justice of their cause and their ability to secure victory , many members of the US military and their families now suspect that the cause may be invalid and the battle unwinnable . \nLast autumn in Iraq , a senior British officer told me how impressed he was by the Americans ' commitment . \n`` Before I came here , '' he said , `` I doubted whether the US army possessed the moral toughness to see this thing through . \nI no longer feel that uncertainty . \nI have not met one American at any level who questions the need to be here , and to finish the job . '' \nThat assertion is no longer true . \nIn the minds of many US soldiers looms the spectre of Vietnam . \nIn recent years , the US army has been forged into a motivated , effective tool for large-scale military operations overseas . \nBut it has never been suited to combating insurgency . \nGuerrillas and suicide bombers can impose a deadly corrosion on conventional forces . \nYears ago , I heard an American general 's lament for what was once a formidable cold war fighting machine . \nHe said to me : `` We went into Korea ... in 1950 with a very poor army , and came out of it in 1953 with a very good one . \nWe went into Vietnam in 1964 with a fine army , and came out in 1975 with a terrible one . '' \nThis is the threat that some thoughtful American officers see hanging over the Iraq deployment . \nThe US armed forces are fighting the sort of conflict that least suits their capabilities . \nIt would be a devastating blow to the confidence painstakingly rebuilt since Vietnam if the US , having committed enormous resources and suffered painful casualties , was obliged to quit Iraq without achieving its purposes . \nYet would military failure represent decisive defeat ? \nMight not America ultimately prevail in Iraq by means in which armed forces play no part ? \nConsider this proposition from Edward Luttwak , the maverick American strategy guru . \nIn a recent speech to a British audience , he suggested that the US began to win the Vietnam war the day after its envoy was humiliatingly evacuated from the roof of the Saigon embassy in April 1975 . \nThe military conflict was lost - but , argued Luttwak , the US began to achieve victory culturally and economically . \nVietnam may still profess a commitment to communism , but in reality capitalism is taking hold at every level . \nAmerican values , represented by corporatism and schools of management studies , are gaining sway over Vietnam as surely as they are every other nation possessed of education and aspirations to prosperity . \nLuttwak describes what is happening as the US acquiring a `` virtual empire '' , founded upon cultural dominance - a convincing proposition , certainly in the eyes of Osama bin Laden , who is attempting to mobilise the Muslim world to resist it . \nAl-Qaida is seeking to combat through terrorism a cultural invasion more effective than stealth bombers and Bradley fighting vehicles . \nBill Gates and Steven Spielberg represent influences much harder to repel than a field army . \nLuttwak 's remarks raise the fascinating possibility that , while the US might be obliged to abandon its military struggle in Iraq , its values will still triumph . \nMight Baghdad emulate Saigon in surrendering its soul to the US , in a fashion Bin Laden would find repugnant , long after the last American soldier has gone home ? \nI am not arguing that military power is redundant . \nBut recent history suggests that America is less skilful in exploiting armed might to fulfil its national purposes than in wielding economic and cultural power , without a soldier in sight . \nLast spring in a refugee camp in Gaza , I was quizzing a cluster of children about what they enjoyed watching on television . \nWithout hesitation they cried : `` Rambo ! \nIt is hard to think of a less appropriate role model . \nWhat seemed significant , however , was not the identity of their icon , but its source . \nThese children 's parents had come to fear , mistrust and , often , hate America . \nYet Hollywood possesses a power greater than any that President Bush can exercise through the Pentagon . \nWhatever the political hostility of young Palestinians to the US , they can not escape its cultural ubiquity . \nTo return to Iraq : even if the insurgents are successful in forcing the US to abandon its armed struggle , they have much less chance of prevailing against Tom Hanks , Julia Roberts and their kind , who can sustain an occupation of Iraqi homes effortlessly now that satellite TV is almost universally available . \nHow fascinating it will be if great armies prove less relevant to the movement of societies in the 21st century than cultural forces . \nWe saw a foretaste of this in the last part of the 20th century . \nIt was not Ronald Reagan 's rearmament of America that brought the Soviet `` evil empire '' to its knees , but economic failure , and it was the same force that obliged the South African apartheid regime to surrender . \nIn the poorest and least educated societies on earth , alas , it is likely that power will continue to be contested at gunpoint . \nBut wherever people are susceptible to external cultural influences - and , in fairness to George Bush , `` wherever they are given freedom to receive such influences '' - soldiers are likely to find their relevance diminished . \nI do not think the US armed forces will achieve their military purposes in Iraq . \nThe American soldiers who have become pessimistic about the campaign they are waging are probably right . \nBut in a long historic view , Microsoft and DreamWorks could achieve a dominance of Baghdad and a power over Iraqi society that eludes George Bush and his armored legions . \nLike a MacBook Pro '' says @Mister_Solomon : Westminster Dog Show - live ! \n"}

{"id": "215", "time": "2005-02-06", "text": "British industrialists are angry that huge American companies like Halliburton and Bechtel win so much business in the UK Haliburton , the US engineering giant formerly headed by vice-president Dick Cheney , has long been a bte noir of British business . \nBut as talks to hammer out a deal over Britain 's new aircraft carriers reached crisis point this weekend , it has never been less loved . \nSince the Iraq war , when the Houston company won contracts to put out oil fires in Iraq without having to bid against competitors , it has been synonymous with White House cronyism . \nBritish engineers and oil industry operators felt they had been frozen out of lucrative work and spat blood . \nWhen it emerged that Halliburton was overcharging for the petrol it was importing from Kuwait , the anger grew . \nInvestigations into the activities of Halliburton subsidiary Kellogg Brown and Root in the Gulf revealed tales of kickbacks to employees , poor cost control , and further overcharging . \nNevertheless , Halliburton secured more contracts to work on Iraqi oil infrastructure . \nUS congressmen headed by Democrat Henry Waxman demanded investigations , not least into the role of Cheney in the contracting process . \nAccording to the US Congress committee on government reform , Halliburton has received $ 10.3 billion from contracts there . \nAlthough US government work in Iraq is channelling less into company coffers this year than last , it still contributed $ 1.7 bn of total $ 5.2 bn revenue in the last quarter of last year . \nThis at a time when Halliburton faces claims worth billions in asbestos-related lawsuits , which saw it post a fourth-quarter net loss of close to $ 1bn . \nHalliburton is facing several investigations around the world . \nKBR is part of a consortium that is under investigation for allegations of bribery in a Nigerian gas contract . \nAnd back in the post-Enron US , the company last year paid $ 7.5 m to settle accusations that it misled investors because it did not disclose an accounting change in 1998 , when Cheney was CEO . \nBut last week the focus was in Britain as KBR UK appeared close to winning a vital role on Britain 's largest-ever naval shipbuilding contract , the roughly # 3bn program to build two new aircraft carriers . \nMinistry of Defense officials were preparing to announce that KBR had been chosen as the ` physical integrator ' -LRB- PI -RRB- on the program , the overseer that will manage the complicated integration of design , systems and construction by a wide range of prime and sub contractors . \nBAE Systems , the UK 's largest defense firm , was furious . \nBAE is part of the alliance - along with Thales of France and the MoD itself - that was formed to manage the project . \nIt is the owner of two of the yards where hull modules could be built . \nIt said it would pull out of the alliance if KBR was chosen as the PI . \nBAE says there is no need to have a body above the alliance and is livid at the thought of it being KBR . \n` They do n't have a happy reputation either here or overseas , ' one company source said last week . \nThe prospect of KBR taking the ` overseer of overseers ' role has united the UK 's often bickering shipbuilders . \n` If they award it to KBR you are going to have the Americans and the French running the carrier program , ' says one . \n` The whole thing is a nonsense . ' \nIt is hard to separate two key issues : unhappiness at the way the carrier contract has been handled over the past two years , and simple dislike of KBR . \nBAE was unhappy that its role as prime contractor was open to competition in the first place , and when two years ago it appeared that its rival , Thales , had won the competition to be prime , it channelled its fury into negotiating its way on to the top table as a project manager , shifting Thales to a design role . \nThe MoD , however , would not demote Thales , and insisted on the two compa nies forming the alliance , with the MoD joining as mediator . \nBAE has flexed its muscles repeatedly , last year announcing the sale of its shipbuilding division in what many industry insiders interpreted as a negotiating tactic to ensure its influence in the program . \nZafar Khan , analyst at SG Securities , says : ` The whole thing is now a bit of a mess . \nThe problem is the buck will pass from one to the other . \nAnd then you get KBR on top of the whole thing , which has added a further layer of complexity . ' \nIf nothing else , the carrier contract has demonstrated that BAE deploys tactics with the MoD that invite comparison with Halliburton 's at the Pentagon . \nNevertheless , BAE 's protestations are echoed by other major UK companies . \nOne source suggested that the real Halliburton agenda was to use the carrier contract as a wedge to break its way into the UK naval shipbuilding business , which has a full order book stretching out more than a decade and a half . \n` We do n't want to open up our numbers and details to KBR and Halliburton . \nThere is unease about letting in a potential competitor and one that probably has another agenda , ' the source said . \nBAE , along with Portsmouth-based VT Group and Babcock , owner of the Rosyth dockyard in Fife , were all nervous when it became clear before Christmas that KBR had won because they suspected it wanted to take work into a disused oil platform yard at Nigg , further up the Scottish coast . \nThe timing is doubly sensitive because the structure of UK shipbuilding is under review . \nThe government and the industry are considering a consolidation of yards into one or two separate companies . \nAnother senior industry figure says : ` The UK builders have suffered from the peaks and troughs of this industry , and now that there is the chance of a sustained peak there is incredulity at why the government is handing it to an outsider . ' \nHe adds : ` If BAE pulls out and becomes a subcontractor , the project -LRB- due for completion between 2012 and 2015 -RRB- will be a disaster and will be late . ' \nMeanwhile , industry leaders suspect KBR may have over-promised on the carrier deal . ' \nI know exactly how they got it , ' says one . \n` Tony Pryor -LRB- head of KBR UK -RRB- went in and said `` Look , we 've built these oil platforms and they 're much bigger than the carrier , and that 's for starters . \nOf course we can do it . '' \nAnd he wowed them . ' \nPryor was unavailable for interview last week , although KBR said it had proven expertise in working on complex major projects and pioneered the alliance approach to contracting . ' \nI saw the spec for the PI contract , ' says one executive . \n` It asked the PI to take all time and financial risk in return for managing the project and taking the margin . \nWe said we could not do that , and I know the others did too , but KBR said okay . ' \nNow , he says , there is evidence that the original specifications have changed , and that KBR is set to win a three-month , # 5m deal to ` scope out ' the responsibilities on the program , before retendering for a longer term . \n` The key question is , what kind of risk will they be taking on when they renegotiate . \nThey are very skilled at renegotiating that kind of thing . ' \nThe implication in all of this is clear - that Halliburton sweet-talks governments into deals . \nDetractors have plenty of precedents to point to . \nKBR 's progenitor , Brown and Root , had close relations with president Lyndon Johnson stretching from his days as a Texan state politician and received contracts to supply logistical support in Vietnam and build dams in the US . \nTwo decades later , KBR drew up the ` Logcap ' arrangements for US military logistical support . \nIt went on to win the contract . \nBut , with the PI contract up for re-tender , the question in the government 's mind will be , how good is KBR ? \n` The only thing you need to say is `` DML '' , ' says one detractor , referring to the company , majority-owned by KBR , that won the contract to build docks at Devonport for refitting nuclear submarines . \nThe original # 576m cost of the project soared by 2002 to # 900m amid unclear responsibilities . \nA report by the National Audit Office found that DML had ` no experience of managing a major construction project that was subject to civil nuclear safety standards ' . \nMoreover , the NAO found that ` despite the stated allocation of risk in the contract , the MoD agreed to fund most of the cost increases ' . \nDetractors have to be careful . \nKBR has won a range of other projects , such as the armed forces Conlog contract -LRB- the UK equivalent of Logcap -RRB- , where it can demonstrate expertise . \nThe NAO says it has no criticisms as yet of this , or any of the other recent deals KBR has won from government , ranging from NHS IT programs to road building . \nIndeed , one of its detractors admits , it has collaborated with KBR in other areas , such as road building , and the work has been good . \n` But there is a bit of a difference between a road and an aircraft carrier , ' he adds . \nMany point to the fact that to mitigate its asbestos liabilities , Halliburton placed KBR in US chapter 11 bankruptcy protection a year ago . \nNow its CEO Dave Lesar has said he wants to sell it . \nOne well-connected Whitehall insideris baffled : ` The thing that puzzles me is why a company with this record , that is up for sale , that could be owned by anyone next month , is being put in charge of the most sensitive defense contract ever ? ' \nA cynic might respond that ministers hope Halliburton does sell KBR . \nThen it will be clear of the shadow of its Houston parent for good . \n"}

\nDealing with underlying structural problems helps , but not as much as how people and institutions behave : whether communities turn a blind eye to provocations ; whether intellectuals and journalists allow lies to take root ; whether leaders whip small resentments into big ones ; whether states respond with sensitivity or crude force . \nFor Britain , three conclusions follow . \nFirst , leaders and institutions need to take great care over what they say and do , whether they are mullahs or ministers . \nOne example illustrates the point . \nThe wrongful arrest of tens of thousands of British Muslims after the September 11 attacks can be explained by the very poor intelligence the police had , and , just possibly , excused by the fact that a terrorist action in Britain linked to British Muslims would have been hugely damaging . \nBut responsible leadership in a diverse society has to mean thinking through all of the possible effects of actions . \nSecond , we need to fight the myths on all sides . \nSecular commentators should be challenged when they claim that Islam is uniquely violent -LRB- what about the horrors committed in the name of Christianity , secular communism or for that matter Hinduism -RRB- . \nThey should be challenged when they paint Islam as uniquely intolerant -LRB- what of the Emperor Akbar who remains the world 's best example of active rather than passive tolerance -RRB- or as bound to subordinate civil life to religion -LRB- what about Turkish or Ottoman history -RRB- . \nEqually , Salafi extremists operating within Muslim communities should be challenged when they propagate lies about American or Zionist conspiracies . \nThey should also be confronted when they exploit real grievances over Palestine but ignore the complexities of Kosovo or Bosnia -LRB- when the west came to the aid of a Muslim minority being oppressed by a Christian majority -RRB- , or the inconvenient fact that the worst slaughter of Muslims of recent years -LRB- in the Iran\\/Iraq war -RRB- was at the hands of other Muslims . \nThird , we need new deals to be negotiated ; compromises which allow life to go on and hold resentments at bay . \nSome of those implicit deals are already taking shape : more autonomy to run Islamic schools in return for a commitment to the national curriculum so that children are prepared for life in modern Britain ; more targeted social programs ; more chances for young Muslims -LRB- and their often equally isolated white working class counterparts -RRB- to mix with others . \nSome of these deals may be uncomfortable when they touch on such issues as the non-negotiability of free speech , the possibility of a limited role for sharia law , or a stronger emphasis on English language skills . \nThe point is that these all have to be talked about and negotiated politically , not treated as matters of absolute and immovable principle . \nSocieties can easily talk themselves into conflict and misery . \nBut they can also talk , and act , their way out . \nGeoff Mulgan is director of the Young Foundation . \n"}
{"id": "4", "time": "2005-06-09", "text": "Stuff Happens ... in LA David Hare 's play about Blair , Bush and the Iraq invasion received its US premiere this week . \nHow did it go down ? \nBy Rob Kendt Thursday 9 June 2005 11.08 BST Big questions ... Nicholas Farrell as Blair and Alex Jennings as Bush in Stuff Happens . \nPhotograph : Tristram Kenton There has to be a name for this noise : something between a jeer and a snicker , a gasp and a murmur . \nMore telling than outright applause or laughter , it is unmistakeably the sound of an audience absorbing a play , rather than simply reacting to it . \nWe heard a lot of that curious noise at the American premiere of Stuff Happens this week at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles . \nDavid Hare 's dramatised account of the run-up to the invasion of Iraq also drew its share of hisses , spontaneous ovations , relieved laughter and intent silence . \nIn Hare 's play , the caricatures of the players we think we know all too well - George Bush , Tony Blair , Colin Powell and the rest - talk back , often stirringly , against our first impressions . \nWhen a dyspeptic Dick Cheney -LRB- Dakin Matthews -RRB- excoriates the world-changing idealism of Blair -LRB- Julian Sands -RRB- , positing instead American security as his sole concern , we 're momentarily hushed into weighing which justification for war is more troubling . \nWhen a pair of mincing French diplomats visit Condeleezza Rice -LRB- Lorraine Toussaint -RRB- to announce that they 're scrapping diplomatic efforts to save Gallic face , we ca n't help but share Rice 's shock at their naked self-interest . \nTo the play 's mass of mostly familiar documentary material , Hare brings an imposing dramatic architecture . \nHe frontloads the play with pro-war voices and rationales , and captures the momentum of inevitability that pervaded those terrible months in late 2002 and early 2003 . \nAt the same time he sets up this house of cards for a hubristic fall in a devastating second act . \nAfter a rapid-fire conclusion that has the Bushies running away unapologetically from their stated casus belli , weapons of mass destruction , Hare closes with an Iraqi exile -LRB- Jay Harik -RRB- , as appalled by the invasion as by Saddam 's reign of terror , stating : `` A country 's leader is its own fault . '' \nTaking Hare 's play directly from its National Theatre debut last autumn is something of a coup for Mark Taper Forum artistic director Gordon Davidson , who 's leaving the post after this season , and for whom Hare 's play makes a fitting farewell . \nDavidson has led the Taper for nearly four decades with a commitment to politically engaged work , from the Vietnam protest play The Trial of the Catonsville Nine -LRB- which famously had FBI agents sniffing around the theater -RRB- to Zoot Suit and Twilight , Los Angeles 1992 . \nDavidson 's production of Stuff Happens is taut and involving , taking full advantage of the Taper 's intimate in-the-round stage to bring the actors out front , and subtly implicating us in scenes set in Congress , the UN , and various press briefing rooms . \nAmerican critics have been mostly enthusiastic of Hare 's play , though many have questioned its neutrality . \n`` Leave it to the vocal peanut gallery -LRB- an Americanism meaning ill-informed people in the cheap seats -RRB- to deliver the obligatory standing ovation , the hisses and the cheers that Stuff Happens - a by no means neutral play - proclaims not to be courting but probably is , '' wrote Evan Henerson in the LA Daily News . \n`` Stuff Happens is not a diatribe , exactly , '' continued Henerson , `` but it 's hardly an unbiased docudrama , either . '' \nIn the Hollywood Reporter , Jay Reiner compared Hare 's strategy with the warmongering tactics he portrays , writing that : `` The playwright had his mind made up well in advance about these people and their motives - and then did his best to disguise this with a thin veneer of objectivity and ideological evenhandedness ... In this sense , the play is much like the political drama it pretends to explore . '' \nVariety 's Joel Hirschhorn admired the play as a `` deeply felt , rigorously researched reminder of governmental manipulation and ineptitude '' , though he found the `` repetitive '' second half began to `` feel like a series of bulletins issued at board meetings '' . \nWriting for the Los Angeles Times , James C Taylor , the only one of our ranks who saw the production at the National in London , was able to report that Keith Carradine 's performance as Bush is `` finely tuned ... certainly more convincing than his London predecessor -LRB- Alex Jennings -RRB- ... and perhaps even more convincing than the genuine article . \n`` Many will no doubt come to the Mark Taper Forum play expecting to see Bush-bashing on a grand scale , '' wrote Taylor . \n`` But thankfully , Hare 's characterisation of the 43rd president of the United States is unique among current portraits , fictional or otherwise . \nThe playwright chooses not to demonise or lionise him . \nRather , Hare shrewdly depicts George W Bush as a man whose power derives simply from the stubbornness of his convictions -LRB- regardless of their origins -RRB- and the lack of similar fortitude on the part of those who oppose him . '' \nRegistering the only strong dissent was the LA Weekly 's Steven Mikulan , who labeled it `` less a play than a timeline '' and found that `` after three hours you do n't know which to despair about more - the imperial direction of our foreign policy or Hare 's declining powers as a scenarist '' . \nOur exposure to Hare 's work , in LA at least , has been glancing : Davidson 's Center Theatre Group brought us Racing Demon and Skylight , and a small local company called Theatre 40 offered a bracing reading of The Secret Rapture years ago . \nStuff Happens is something altogether different , the first significant dramatic narrative about the Iraq war in any medium , deposited on the very doorstep of the fabulists of Hollywood . \nIt is shaming to report , in fact , that no American playwright , let alone filmmaker , has yet attempted anything close to its scope or acuity . \nWe have seen Tim Robbins 's brittle agitprop revue , Embedded , whose main achievement was to prove that Robbins should stick to acting and offstage activism . \nAnd of course there was Fahrenheit 9\\/11 , a sui generis blast of American bluster that no one could accuse of undue circumspection . \nPerhaps it takes a dramatist from the erstwhile empire that gave the world Shakespeare and Shaw to remind us of the uniquely immediate voice that theater can raise in the discourse about central questions of the age - not least because it invites us to add our own buzzing soundtrack of real-time reactions to the mix . \nStuff Happens is at the Mark Taper Forum , Los Angeles , until July 17 . \nBox office : -LRB- 00 1 -RRB- 213-6282772 Letters for publication should be sent to : letters@guardian.co.uk If you need help using the site : userhelp@guardian.co.uk Call the main Guardian and Observer switchboard : Latest news , views and links from the Guardian 's stage team Compare and buy tickets for thousands of events \n"}
{"id": "141", "time": "2005-12-16", "text": "What makes a great war film ? \nAs Sam Mendes ' Jarhead tackles the 1991 Gulf conflict , James Meek , who has reported from the battlefields of Iraq , gives his verdict Fire away : a scene from Jarhead Oscar night in April 1979 marked a shift of key for the Hollywood war film , a genre whose explosions keep going off in newspaper columns and political discourse long after the closing credits have rolled . \nMichael Cimino 's The Deer Hunter , about an Orthodox community in a steel town whose sons go to Vietnam , won best film and best director . \nCimino was given one statuette by Francis Ford Coppola - whose own Vietnam movie , Apocalypse Now , was destined for a cooler critical reception when it limped into the cinemas a few months later - and the other by John Wayne . \nIt was Wayne 's last public appearance before he died . \nHis attempt , as actor-director , to apply the propagandistic certainties of his second world war films to a celluloid Vietnam , The Green Berets , had been a failure as art or entertainment or , indeed , propaganda . \nAnother Vietnam film , Coming Home , won Jane Fonda a best actress Oscar that night . \nAccording to Peter Biskind , Fonda , whose visit to Communist North Vietnam during the war still makes her an object of hate for the American right , lashed out at Cimino backstage , saying The Deer Hunter was a `` racist , Pentagon version of the war '' . \nTwo decades later , along with their M16s , gas masks and Kevlar helmets , the young US marines preparing for war in the Arabian desert in Sam Mendes ' new film , Jarhead , carry a new piece of equipment into battle : irony . \nWatching Apocalypse Now on base at Camp Pendleton , the marine characters in the Mendes movie sing along with The Ride of the Valkyries broadcast from the attack helicopters in the Coppola movie . \nIn camp in Saudi Arabia , they sit down to enjoy a video of The Deer Hunter only to find that the wife who sent it has deliberately taped over the Cimino film with a home movie of her having sex with the neighbor . \nMendes is doing a couple of things with the references to post-Vietnam classics . \nOne is to point out that thoughtful liberal film-makers who set out to make movies showing the futility and waste of war run the risk of celebrating it instead for that significant host of men who , among themselves , only glory in their association with death - the risk of receiving it , and the chance of dealing it out . \nLike the Wall Street brokers who burst into cheers when Gordon Gekko , the supposed-to-be-odious broker in Oliver Stone 's Wall Street , declares `` Greed is good '' , like the Russian mafia neophytes who reportedly based their philosophy on The Godfather , films about US marines are bound to be watched by US marines . \nNow that the US , like Britain , has an all-volunteer military - in Vietnam , most of the troops were conscripts - your average marine is much more likely to be the kind of guy who is in uniform because he yearns to feel what it is like to be afraid of violent injury , and what it is like to frighten others . \nWhen I asked a 19-year-old marine in Iraq last year why he 'd joined up , he said : `` I 've always been into explosions and , you know , just , just , uh , action movies . '' \nThe other side of the ironic references to Vietnam films in Jarhead is provocative . \n`` Compare mine to theirs , '' it says . \nIt 's ballsy and risky of Mendes to put Jarhead up against The Deer Hunter and Apocalypse Now - the latter having so grown in reputation since it appeared . \nCan they be compared ? \nIs Jarhead a war film ? \nWhat is a war film , anyway - is Schindler 's List a war film ? \nIs Lawrence of Arabia -LRB- another film Mendes references visually -RRB- ? \nIs the musical Oh What a Lovely War a war film , or The Crying Game ? \nIs Wag the Dog a war film ? \nThere 's a war in it , but not a real one . \nMillions are killed off-screen , and there are heaps of skulls , but there is n't exactly a war in The Killing Fields . \nBrian De Palma made a feature in 1987 in which an idealistic young officer and his tough , experienced sergeant lead a group of heavily armed misfits into battle against an evil , equally heavily armed foe which threatens everything they and their families hold dear . \nBullets fly , there are casualties on both sides ; in the end right triumphs over both might and cynicism . \nBut The Untouchables is n't a war film . \nAll war films tell two stories , the story of a war , and the story of the men fighting it . \n-LRB- Although large numbers of women have served in the US marines since the 1980s , you would n't know this from Jarhead -RRB- . \nBy this measure , Mendes ' movie certainly counts as a war film , yet , based as it is on Anthony Swofford 's memoir of a stint in the US marines which took him to the Arabian Gulf , it has more in common with the clutch of Vietnam films that appeared in the late 1980s than with those of 1979 - Oliver Stone 's Platoon , Stanley Kubrick 's Full Metal Jacket and John Irvin 's Hamburger Hill . \nLess `` pity the world that has war visited upon it '' ; more `` pity the poor soldier '' . \nIt 's more to do with how a group of young American men party , quarrel , bitch , brawl , boast , pose , amuse themselves and bond in an intimate group facing danger than about the wider impact of war on families , civilians or the world at large . \nJarhead is , nonetheless , an oddity . \nIt begins conventionally enough . \nThere are certain cinematic rites of passage which non-Americans have seen so often that it is almost as if they have become part of their own childhood . \nI sometimes feel as if I once asked a girl to the senior prom by a bank of metal lockers in the corridor of a mid-western high school ; as if I walked through a screen door to shoot baskets with my eager-to-bond father in the twilight in the forecourt outside our non-existent garage ; and as if , once , I stood in green fatigues on a hot parade ground , being shrieked at by a sergeant - black , naturally - in a broad-brimmed hat , to whom I would yell back : `` SIR , YES , SIR ! '' \nSwofford , played by Jake Gyllenhaal , endures this experience and the usual set of boot camp humiliations . \nWhat makes the film peculiar both as a war film and as a reflection on America 's present hideous entanglement in Iraq is its timing and the Twilight Zone-nature of the war Swofford and his comrades are eventually sent to take part in . \nJarhead is set in the 1991 Gulf War , when US troops led a genuine international coalition - including , it is strange to remember now , troops from Syria , Egypt , Saudi Arabia and France - to expel Iraqi troops from Kuwait , leaving Iraq as soon as they 'd achieved this . \nTheir commander in chief is George Bush , but it 's the other George Bush , the present White House incumbent 's father . \nThe only Arabs the marines get close to in the film are shimmery Bedouin on the horizon and the charred , unrecognisable bodies of Iraqi troops subject to US air attack . \nNone of the marines in Swofford 's section fire a shot in anger ; the only US casualties are those killed by friendly fire . \nThe young American warriors in Jarhead do n't get the chance to be a threat to Arabs - the nearest Swofford gets is having an Iraqi officer in the sights of his sniper 's rifle and reading about the killing of an Arab by Albert Camus - and never seem threatened themselves . \nSwofford gets rained on by crude oil , sits down to commune with a set of scorched Iraqi corpses , is made to shovel shit with a Santa Claus hat on his head and loses a comrade after they 're discharged , but the thing that seems to affect him most deeply is being dumped , while in the desert , by his girlfriend . \nSince the character played by Gyllenhaal is a fit , attractive , educated 20-year-old American male , and since there is nothing in the film to tell us anything about their relationship except that Swofford really liked having sex with her , you may find it hard to equate his plight with , say , the experience of having your entire family wiped out when a bomb is dropped on your house by mistake . \nHistorically , the lack of fighting the US marines were involved in on the ground in 1991 , while the allied air armada roared overhead , dealing death and destruction on Iraq , is accurate . \nTheir main role was as a feint , making the Iraqis think they were going to land on Kuwait 's beaches . \nWhen they finally entered Kuwait - some time after air power and the tanks of the US , British and French armies had chased the Iraqis north - there was n't much for the marines to do except take the surrender of thousands of Iraqi troops . \nYet it 's odd to have such a non-war war film playing in the cinemas when , before and after the performance , you 'll be reading in the papers and watching on TV about scores of Iraqis being killed in car bombs , about US marines being killed by roadside bombs , about Iraqis and Afghans being tortured or arrested or killed or having their property damaged by US troops , about anti-war feelings growing inside America . \nIn a curious way , an earlier 1991 Gulf War feature , Three Kings , though it was too hip , funky and sentimental to be a great film , engaged better than Jarhead does with today 's disaster in Iraq - and Three Kings was made in 1999 , when the dismal phrase `` war on terror '' had n't sounded around the world . \nThe pundits do on occasion work themselves up into a lather about how `` realistic '' a war film is . \nThere was excitement , when Steven Spielberg brought out Saving Private Ryan , at how genuine the portrayal of the slaughter on the beaches in the early hours of D-Day was . \nAlthough very few people alive today , including serving soldiers , have experienced that sustained intensity of combat , it did have the appearance of authenticity . \nYet that realism counts for nothing if the characters and story in the film are n't real too -LRB- Private Ryan ends absurdly with a Magnificent Seven-style shootout -RRB- . \nPerhaps it is asking too much of war films to be realistic when war itself is so unlike the reality western audiences know . \nIt 's not that actors are incapable of capturing the intensity of men at war . \nWhat they can not do is capture the vacancy of men at war . \nApart from the technical difficulty of conveying to cinema audiences the actual loudness of military explosives , and the fact actors are usually too old for raw recruits -LRB- Gyllenhaal is 25 , his sniping partner Peter Sarsgaard 34 , when the average age of boot camp newbies is 19 -RRB- , the dramatic demands of a commercial film make it impossible to capture the salient characteristic of ordinary soldiers - that they are exhausted most of the time . \nJarhead is a war film , but it is constricted , like Platoon , by the narrow vision of the pity-the-soldier genre . \nIndeed , Jarhead often slips into envy-the-soldier territory for naive young men - the lack of gore , the marines ' experience of war as freakish , transient vision , the sheer boyish locker-room fun Swofford and his pals enjoy in the desert as they booze , boogie and flex their torsos , means Jarhead wo n't be troubling US recruiters in the way today 's news footage does . \nThe key to a film about war is how it ends , and if the young man at the film 's center is lifted out of the battlefield uninjured and sane , if his family and home life before and after are n't prominent in the picture , the movie is diminished as a film which says something about war and becomes a simpler story of growing up , of jeopardy overcome . \nThat 's what happens to Charlie Sheen 's character at the end of Platoon , and that 's what happens to Jake Gyllenhaal 's character at the end of Jarhead . \nIt is easy to understand why Jane Fonda abominated The Deer Hunter . \nThe Vietnamese characters are not sympathetic or deep , the American soldiers are , and the movie ends with the survivors sitting around the table , singing God Bless America . \nBut that simplistic summary , and Fonda 's hostility , mischaracterise the subtlety and complexity of Cimino 's feature : the tender slowness with which he describes the home town the conscripts come from , which makes you understand the coldness of the American war machine , the depth of the betrayal involved in hurling trusting young patriots into an incomprehensible nightmare for which their upbringing has not prepared them , and the true , lingering nature of war wounds . \nAnd even The Deer Hunter , like all Hollywood war films , carries a morally flawed premise that the world can not rely on the US film industry to correct : namely that the only truly important thing , in wars waged by Americans , is what happens to the Americans . \n"}

'' \nOne newspaper , Itijah al-Akhar , illustrated the theme with a bridge in the shape of two hands shaking . \nAnother paper , Al Mada , showed a flower growing from a cactus . \nA state television network , al-Iraqiya , showed Shias and Sunnis chanting together . \nUm Qasim , 54 , a Shia who lost her son to an insurgent attack , said that Mr Ubeydi was a hero . \n`` We are one nation , '' she added . \nIraqi Sunnis , a once dominant minority , have been marginalised since the fall of Saddam Hussein . \nTheir insurgency against the Shia-led government has produced escalating tit-for-tat assassinations and massacres . \nHowever , few expect Mr Ubeydi 's story to turn back the sectarian tide . \nThough there was no suicide bomber , many Shias blamed last week 's stampede on a climate of fear fostered by the insurgents . \nA subsequent spate of attacks against Sunnis was thought to be a backlash , and a unity rally near the bridge at the weekend fizzled out . \nShots were exchanged between the Shia west bank of the Tigris and the Sunni east bank . \nSaddam is scheduled to go on trial on a charge of mass killing on October 19 , Iraq 's government spokesman confirmed yesterday , adding that several of the ousted dictator 's associates , including one of his half-brothers , would face trial with him . \n`` They will be tried for the execution of 143 citizens , '' he said , referring to reprisals for an assassination attempt on Saddam in the Shia village of Dujail in 1982 , after which more than 140 male villagers were killed . \n"}

wins and losses were measured in milliseconds . \nIt was never an ambition to be doing that , so when the Jakarta bureau was short-staffed in 1998 I jumped at the chance to go . \nI landed at the right time . \nIndonesia had been stable for 30 years , but within a week of my arrival , the capital exploded in rioting - for the first time I was at the center of a huge international story and being tear-gassed . \nThe anxiety I experienced then returns every time I am in a new country . \nBut it prepared me for the dangers I faced during the 1999 East Timor crisis , underlined by the death of a Dutch journalist . \nThankfully , I was under the guidance of Kurt Schork , a truly inspirational figure who was later killed in Sierra Leone . \nFrom there I was posted in Bangkok , a regional hub covering several countries , which involved a lot of traveling . \nBurma was a tragic place to visit , but I was lucky to be there when Aung San Suu Kyi was released from house arrest . \nAmid scenes of mass celebrations , it reminded me why I loved being a reporter : to meet amazing people from around the globe . \nWhen the Afghanistan war started in 2001 , I was itching to go in . \nBut frustratingly , I had not completed the requisite training back in Britain . \nI rushed home to do it , enabling me to be based in Kandahar , albeit after the fall of Kabul . \nThe only reason I was there was in case Osama bin Laden was captured nearby , but in reality , little was going on . \nIn this job you often find yourself marooned somewhere for weeks because something could happen and we must be there if it does . \nI do envy my newspaper colleagues , because they have the time to pursue their own stories , confident that wire services can tell the main story of the day as a backup . \nYet I do n't feel in direct competition with them , apart from in terms of finding scoops . \nI like the adrenaline ; as soon as something happens , you have to report it . \nIn Kandahar , though , I proved you can make a story out of anything by chatting to locals . \nMy war reporting experience saw me sent to Kuwait ahead of the Iraq war in 2003 . \nThe plan was to be embedded with the US military and I underwent chemical and biological warfare training . \nBut as the war became delayed , I faced a personal dilemma : my sister was getting married at the start of April and I had to decide whether to invade Iraq with the US Marines or attend the wedding . \nIt would have been the biggest story of my life , but I went home . \nAfter the war I was able to go into Basra and from there I took on the Baghdad job . \nI do n't think anybody in journalism has experienced conditions like those in the Iraqi capital and faced a comparable level of risk for such a sustained period of time . \nThe main stress was n't for my own safety - running things from the office , I did n't go out much - but for my team of around 50 Iraqi staff who were putting themselves in extreme danger . \nOn leave for a couple of weeks , I would try to de-stress in England or on a beach in Thailand . \nBut I would get depressed when I switched on CNN and saw the carnage from Iraq . \nI found it astonishing that I worked there and would question the wisdom of going back . \nOn my return , I would wonder whether the holiday was worthwhile . \nAfter two years in the role - one of the longest serving journalists in Iraq since the war - I felt it was time to get out a couple of months ago . \nLeaving behind my Iraqi colleagues was hard , because they will still have to live through the difficult conditions . \nWhen I was back in London , I was n't due to be working , but on July 7 I raced into the office to help with the coverage of the bombings . \nI thought I had left behind multiple suicide bombings and I did n't expect to be writing about them happening at home . \nJobs Correspondent , Reuters -LRB- 1994 - -RRB- , including postings in Dublin , Jakarta , Bangkok , Kuwait and Iraq Career high The Iraqi elections were amazing to cover . \nI was worried about the safety of my staff and thought the polls would be overshadowed by bloodshed . \nBut millions turned out to vote and Reuters was quoted by President Bush at the end of the day Career low When friends and colleagues are killed covering a story . \nWe 've had many losses in the Baghdad bureau and I fear there will be more casualties Letters for publication should be sent to : letters@guardian.co.uk If you need help using the site : userhelp@guardian.co.uk Call the main Guardian and Observer switchboard : How to be ...

The government wants to overhaul the university admissions system , changing it from a complicated muddle of deadlines and form-filling to a new complicated muddle of deadlines and form-filling . \nIt 's always going to be that complicated because it involves assessing the skills of around 1 million students and then trying to shoehorn them into the right courses . \nContinue reading ... Oliver King is our new politics editor . \nHe writes : While it 's easy to dismiss the current Conservative leadership contest as little more than a political beauty contest , the race is about far more than a job title . \nThe future of party policy is up for grabs and senior Tories are seizing on the opportunity to dump on policies they never liked in the first place . \nAccording to this morning 's Daily Telegraph , Andrew Lansley , the party 's cerebral shadow health secretary , wants to drop their `` patients ' passport '' policy , their idea of cutting waiting lists by letting patients use NHS money to subsidise private operations . \nWhile he never said so explicitly in a speech on Wednesday to the NHS confederation , there is little doubt about what he meant . \nHe told his audience : `` It is most important to engage the public positively with choice and competition extended to everyone , than to be directed into a benefit for a minority . '' \nThe point being that giving patients half the cost of a # 5,000 hip operation only helps if you can afford to fund the other half . \nContinue reading ... The non-evacuation of New Orleans is one of the harder to understand events of the last few months . \nFirst , that while an evacuation order was given the only choice for those who could not leave , who were too frail or did not have cars , was to stay in their homes or a shelter . \nSecond , that when evacuation buses were laid on there are several thousands who would not go . \nPresumably they do not want to leave the city and their possessions behind , or , amid the nightmarish toxic waters and rotting flesh , do not believe it can get any worse . \nFor the second time this summer the first was in the Gaza Strip we are to see forced evacuations . \nAnother international story , but this time intriguing rather than hard to understand , is the illness of Jacques Chirac . \nHe left hospital today but , as Jon Henley will report in his World Dispatch there are allegations of a cover up over the state of his health . \nIn Britain , the chancellor , Gordon Brown , has announced that five countries and Bill Gates are to support his International Finance Facility to raise money to immunise children in the developing world . \nAt the Oval , England appear to be close to the end of their first innings , perhaps not as close as bowler Glenn McGrath would like , but it can not be long before they are in the field . \nIf you are an undecided voter ahead of next week 's German election , there 's only one place to turn . \nSo far more than 2 million Germans have already logged on to Wahl-O-Mat - an online guide to which party most corresponds with your views . \nUndecided voters have to answer a series of 30 questions . \nSome of them are overtly political : do you think , for example , that Germany 's strict dismissal protection laws should be relaxed ? \nOthers are more general : should there be a speed limit on Germany 's autobahn , and should compulsory military service be abolished ? \nThere is also foreign policy : do you agree that Turkey should be in the EU ? \nAnd drugs : should hashish should be legalised ? \nYou can agree , disagree , say you are `` neutral '' or , if you are an inveterate fence-sitter - skip to the next question . \nAt the end you click on `` result '' . \nWahl-O-Mat lists the five parties in order , with the one most compatible with your views at the top . \nFounded in the Netherlands , Wahl-o-Mat was first used in Germany during the last election in 2002 , when some 3.6 million wavering voters logged on . \nIt 's run by the Bundeszentrale f r politische Bildung -LRB- Federal Agency for Political Education -RRB- , an independent body . \nWith record numbers of Germans still undecided this time , it could yet play a crucial role in determining whether Angela Merkel can put together a centre-right coalition , or is forced into a grand alliance with Gerhard Schr der 's SPD , as now seems likely . \nThe results , of course , can be reassuring , surprising , dismaying , or baffling and may not coincide wih your own apparent preferences . \nWhen I tried it earlier this week , the Wahl-O-Mat told me I should vote for the Linkspartei , Germany 's new anti-business Left party , followed by the pro-business Liberal FDP , an unlikely pairing . \nNext came the Greens , followed by the SPD , with the CDU bottom - a result that surely refutes the claim made by some of you bloggers out there that I 'm some sort of CDU stooge . \nAnyone interested in German politics should give it a spin . \nThere are many things that distinguish a Green party conference - opening today in the picturesque city of Lancaster - from the run-of-the-mill get-togethers of the big three parties . \nIt is not just the pagan worship meetings -LRB- with them being held at dawn , this correspondent has yet to make it to one -RRB- , the recycling bins -LRB- it is embarrassing to consider how many forests must perish to provide journalists with printouts of speeches - most of which go straight in the bin - at the other three -RRB- or the number of small children happily galivanting around the conference floor as the looming environmental Armageddon is discussed from the podium -LRB- the Greens seem to be particularly fertile , as well as child-friendly -RRB- . \nWhat takes a little time to sink in , at least for the seasoned political anorak such as your correspondent , is what is n't here . \nThere simply is n't any commercial or corporate sponsorship of the event . \nContinue reading ... A deeply shocking account by two paramedics stranded in New Orleans alleges that police lied to residents , saying buses were waiting to evacuate them - and then fired shots above their heads when they tried to reach them . \nIt 's well worth reading in full , and gives the lie to claims that officials did all they could to help people escape the stricken city . \nLarrie Bradshaw and Lorrie Beth Slonsky were attending a conference in the city when the hurricane struck . \nUnable to find transport , they pooled money with around 500 people staying in the same hotel and paid $ 25,000 for buses to come and pick them up . \n`` We later learned that the minute they arrived at the city limits , they were commandeered by the military , '' the account says . \nContinue reading ... It is the debate that barely dare speak its name : should they rebuild ? \nShould they move it ? \nSeveral US commentators and the odd brave politician are starting to ask the questions , faced with the dizzying cost of rebuilding and fears over the low-lying city 's future vulnerability . \nMany evacuees have said they will not return . \nThere may not be much evidence of people doing , as Barbara Bush put it , `` very well '' out of the disaster but it seems certain that many will make new lives elsewhere . \nA lot of the homes destroyed by Hurricane Katrina were not insured and the insurance payments for those that were could be spent anywhere . \nIn today 's lead article on Slate , editor at large Jack Shafer argues that the city should not be rebuilt , and being careful to praise its history and people , lists its problems before Katrina hit : the old housing stock , the failing schools , the crime . \nSure there will always be the higher-lying areas and the tourist-draw of the historic French Quarter , until a `` big one -LRB- new hurricane -RRB- hits '' , but he answers `` Do n't refloat '' , to the question of rebuilding . \nShafer cites a professor in earth and sciences who says that New Orleans `` wants to be a lake '' and should never have been built in the first place . \nThere is also at least one politician who has dared to question the pledges to rebuild : speaker of the House Dennis Hastert . \nHe said in an interview that spending billions on a city that is below sea level `` does n't make sense to me '' , although he rowed back on the issue in a later statement . \nOther commentators have asked whether the city should be rebuilt on land less vulnerable to hurricanes and levee breaks . \nA New York Times piece entitled Putting Down New Roots on More Solid Ground said the city 's population had been declining anyway : down from a zenith in 1960 of some 630,000 people to around 445,000 in the last census . \nIt is estimated that some 250,000 of the evacuees wo n't come back . \nThe relief effort for Hurricane Katrina may have been slow getting off the ground - but internet scam artists have shown no lack of initiative , writes David Fickling . \nFraudsters now see a major disaster as perfect bait to draw in the unwary : the aftermath of the south Asian tsunami saw dozens of such scams , and Katrina seems to have sparked even more . \nThe FBI reports that more than 500 sites have been advertising Katrina relief services , with 300 established last Friday alone . \nSome are no doubt legitimate and sincere , but several have already been fingered for alleged illegal practice . \nContinue reading ... Until this week , there was little doubt who was going to win Germany 's general election the conservative leader Angela Merkel . \nHer Christian Democrat party -LRB- CDU -RRB- was comfortably ahead in the polls and would , it appeared , have little difficulty in putting together a centre-right government along with its coalition partner , the liberal Free Democrats -LRB- FDP -RRB- . \nThe latest survey published by Forsa yesterday , however , suggests that , with 10 days to go , there are distinct signs of a late swing towards Gerhard Schrder 's Social Democrats . \nThe poll shows the SPD up three points , to 34 % , with the Greens on 7 % and the new Left party on 8 % . \nWhile the CDU are still ahead on 42 % , the FDP is marooned on just 6 % . \nFor the first time in weeks , Mrs Merkel 's conservative coalition has just 48 % , compared to 49 % for the left parties . \nContinue reading ...

The comments from Barbara Bush yesterday on how things are `` working very well '' for the `` underprivileged '' survivors of Hurricane Katrina are attracting a lot of interest on blogs today . \nAfter touring a relief center in Texas , the First Mother is reported to have told the Public Broadcasting Service : What I 'm hearing , which is sort of scary , is they all want to stay in Texas . \nEveryone is so overwhelmed by the hospitality . \nAnd so many of the people in the arena here , you know , were underprivileged anyway , so this is working very well for them . \nThe American Flyer blog also pulls up the remarks below from Mrs Bush - which have something of a congruent tone - on Good Morning America in March 2003 about speculation in the media before the US-led invasion of Iraq on the scale of US fatalities . \nWhy should we hear about body bags , and deaths , and how many , what day it 's gonna happen , and how many this or what do you suppose ? \nOh , I mean , it 's not relevant . \nSo why should I waste my beautiful mind on something like that ? \nThe blogger comments : `` So look out . \nIf you were n't born with a silver spoon in your mouth , you may just get poked in the eye with Bush 's compassion stick .

Tony Blair meets the Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh on a visit to Delhi . \nPhotograph : John D McPugh\\/Getty The Guardian 's political editor Michael White has spent this week traveling to China and India with the prime minister , as he arranges trade deals , meets heads of government , and plays some very bad football . \nHe writes from Delhi : The prime minister was up early this morning and in stockinged feet , he and Mrs Blair laid a wreath and threw red rose petals on the memorial to Mahatma Ghandi , the father of Indian independence . \nNow the PM has gone on to visit an HIV\\/Aids clinic while his entourage of businessmen are making contacts and hopefully trading deals of mutual benefit . \nThe EU commission president , Jos Manuel Barroso , is also in tow , as Mr Blair has been wearing both his European and British hats on his visits to China and India this week . \nHe 's spent the first day of each trip representing the political , economic and cultural interests of the EU , as the president of the council of ministers , and the second day as prime minister pushing the interests of Britain . \nA voter at a Cairo polling station shows his finger dipped in ink to indicate he has voted in Egypt 's presidential elections . \nPhotograph : Khaled Desouki\\/AFP\\/Getty Today 's presidential election is the first time Egyptians have been able to pick an alternative to their leader , Hosni Mubarak , but few expect to see change , writes David Fickling . \nMamduh Shawqi sees the whole process as a play : `` The candidates are hilarious people , which makes you think they were probably all chosen by the current system to play the role of candidates , '' he writes . \nThe disillusion of many bloggers sits side-by-side with a weary excitement at the remote possibility of change . \nRitzy Mabrouk delivers a potent picture of Cairo holding its breath as election day dawns , but concludes the election is a `` dirty mess '' . \nOthers see more potential in the contest . \nContinue reading ... Forget about the policies - one of the most intriguing aspects of next week 's general election in Germany has been the bands , or at least the campaign songs , used by the parties to stir up the voters . \nEveryone knows by now that the Christian Democrats have been using the Rolling Stones song Angie , from the album Goats Head Soup , as their theme tune . \nBut what about the others ? \nWell , traveling down to Cottbus last week for a rally of the new Linkspartei - or Left party - I was astonished to hear the band afterwards break into 70s British glam rock . \nNot just any old glam rock , but The Sweet 's classic Blockbuster the first song I ever bought -LRB- you know , the one with the wailing police siren in it . \nIt goes ` a-wooo ' , ` a-wooo ' , etc -RRB- . \nAdmittedly , most of the east German pensioners rapidly left , but I was enthralled . \nContinue reading ... David Blunkett 's objection to an in-depth interview he gave `` as a favor '' to a student appearing in the London Evening Standard raises a few questions about the ethics of using quotes given in the belief that they will never be published , writes Claire Cozens . \nThe secretary of state for work and pensions , who resigned from government last year after an investigation found he helped secure a visa for his former lover 's nanny , claims he did not grant his permission for the interview to be published . \nThe interview , in which Mr Blunkett discussed his complex personal life , his political ambitions and the problems of coping with his disability , has gained widespread coverage in the media since it was published yesterday . \nThe team surrounding the UN secretary-general , Kofi Annan , freely admits he has taken a battering over the last year , mainly because of the investigation into the Iraq oil-for-food program , writes Ewen MacAskill . \nWhen he set up the investigation in April last year , he can not have imagined that both he and the organization he serves would be so severely criticised in the report published today . \nHe has been undermined mainly by the disclosures about the behavior of his son , Kojo , whose former employer Cotecna was one of the successful bidders for one of the Iraq contracts . \nIn spite of the criticism , he says he is not planning to resign and intends to see out the remainder of his tenure , due to end in December next year . \nBut the investigation has left him weak and vulnerable . \nThe UN summit next week , the biggest-ever meeting of world leaders , was supposed to be the high point of his stewardship of the UN as world leaders commit to meeting targets for poverty reduction and universal primary education for all . \nInstead , the summit will end up diluting the final document , mainly at the behest of the US , which opposes the financing of the development targets , objecting even to the term `` millennium development goals '' . \nContinue reading ... More than a week after Hurricane Katrina hit , the evacuation of New Orleans continues . \nThis time it is enforced . \nAfter those who could not leave it is the turn of the estimated 10,000 who would not . \nWe have an interactive guide to where the evacuees are going and will be rounding up on Newsblog the latest on the web on the recovery . \nA report on the UN oil-for-food program , which Kofi Annan said he wished the organization had never got involved in , is released at 3pm today . \nThe preface -LRB- read it here -RRB- was released yesterday , accusing the UN of `` corrosive corruption '' , so what we will be looking out for today is Mr Annan 's response . \nDiplomatic editor Ewen MacAskill will be blogging about what the report means for the UN and some of its most determined critics . \nOn Online blog , Bobbie Johnson is writing about the preparations for Apple 's expected iPhone , and is hoping to report live from a north London satellite link-up with San Francisco where more details will be revealed . \nOn Newsblog , there is a certain amount of anticipation in air as England prepare for the final Ashes Test against Australia . \nWe will be looking at cricket and literature , particularly the news that the sound of leather on willow has inspired John Major to write poetry . \nHurricane Katrina , and its terrible aftermath , are being covered in great detail by the international media and in the blogosphere . \nIt is a complex , moving and quickly developing story , and it can be a challenge to reach out and grab the best coverage and comment . \nBelow is an attempt to round up some of today 's best links on the hurricane and the recovery efforts that are following , complementing an earlier Newsblog round-up of notable links . \nPlease feel free to insert other good links in the comment field . \nWired carries some good hurricane stories , one hailing the great emergency resource of sciponius.com . \nThis uses a Google Map of the disaster area as a template , and allows users to post information about specific areas and streets . \nThe entries give evolving information such as how submerged a certain area is , or whether it has mobile phone coverage . \nWired describes the site as a `` wiki disaster map '' . \nAnother interesting Wired story outlines attempts being made to develop modern ways of replacing the sandbag as the answer to blocking broken levees . \nIt looks at three floodwall systems being examined by the US military , which use a variety of plastic and other methods : Geocell Systems , Hesco and Portadam . \nContinue reading ...

'' \nNo wonder Mr Annan said he wished the UN had never been given the program . \nBut it was and the UN did not cover itself in glory during the $ 61bn -LRB- # 33bn -RRB- project , one of the UN 's biggest operations ever . \nBenon Sevan , the UN official in charge of the program , last month resigned from the organization just days before he was accused in a previous report of receiving $ 147,184 -LRB- # 83,000 -RRB- to help to facilitate an oil deal . \nContinue reading ...

This is the first of Luke Harding 's daily blog posts from Berlin in the run-up to the election on September 18 Honours even ? \nAngela Merkel and Gerhard Schrder shake hands after the debate . \nPhotograph : AP\\/RTL It was the biggest TV event since Germany lost to Brazil in the 2002 World Cup final . \nSome 20 million Germans tuned in to watch the only debate of the German election campaign between the chancellor Gerhard Schr der and his conservative challenger Angela Merkel . \nBut who actually won ? \nWell , if you believe the polls conducted immediately after the gripping 90-minute clash it was a clear victory for Gerd as Schr der 's friends call him . \nAccording to a poll for ZDF television , some 48 % of viewers believed Schr der was the winner , while only 28 % thought Merkel had triumphed . \nAnd among undecided voters his figures were even better , with 58 per saying that Gerd had won , compared to only 16 % for Angie . \nAt first glance the result seems baffling not least given that most journalists -LRB- including this one -RRB- thought Frau Merkel got the better of her rival . \nShe seemed quicker than Schr der , superior when it came to detail and even made a joke . \nTony Blair today apologised to Britons caught up in Hurricane Katrina who said they felt `` abandoned '' by by the Foreign Office . \nToday we 'll be contacting Gary Younge in New Orleans for an audio dispatch from the empty , ruined city , which he described in this piece in today 's Guardian . \nWe 'll also be updating our list of blogs covering the aftermath of the tragedy . \nMr Blair 's comments came during a visit to China , where he later held talks with President Hu Jintao in his capacity as holder of the rotating EU presidency . \nAlso in China , there are conflicting reports over whether the EU and China have in fact reached a deal to end the so-called `` bra wars '' . \nIn Indonesia , at least 117 people died today when an aircraft crashed into a crowded residential area in the city of Medan shortly after takeoff . \nAnd here on Newsblog we 'll have the first of Berlin correspondent Luke Harding 's daily dispatches ahead of the German election in two weeks ' time . \n"}

Board of Education , which overturned the segregation of public schools ; the `` one man one vote '' cases of 1962-1964 , which dramatically altered the relative power of rural regions in many states ; and Hernandez v. Texas , which gave Mexican-Americans the right to serve on juries . \nWarren Burger , appointed chief justice by Richard Nixon in 1969 , also disappointed conservatives . \nBurger did not move to oveturn the major decisions of the Warren court and in the most controversial ruling of his term , Roe v. Wade , Burger voted with the majority to recognize the right to abortion . \nMore recently , Justice Anthony Kennedy , who was appointed by Ronald Reagan , has pushed the court to defend homosexuality and abolish the juvenile death penalty . \nIn recent years , the court was evenly balanced between liberals and conservatives , often ruling 5-4 on important cases . \nBut if Bush has his way , the court could take a decisive shift to the right . \n"}

{"id": "153", "time": "2005-09-02", "text": "Katrina comes home to roost President Bush is to blame for the scale of the disaster as a result of his administration 's policies and actions Friday 2 September 2005 10.29 BST Biblical in its uncontrolled rage and scope , the storm has left millions of Americans to scavenge for food and shelter , and hundreds reportedly dead . \nWith its main levee broken , the evacuated city of New Orleans has become part of the Gulf of Mexico . \nBut the damage wrought by Hurricane Katrina may not entirely be the result of an act of nature . \nA year ago the US army corps of engineers proposed to study how New Orleans could be protected from a catastrophic hurricane , but the Bush administration ordered that the research not be undertaken . \nAfter a flood killed six people in 1995 , the Congress created the Southeast Louisiana Urban Flood Control Project . \nOperated by the corps of engineers , levees and pumping stations were strengthened and renovated . \nIn 2001 , when George Bush became president , the Federal Emergency Management Agency issued a report stating that a hurricane striking New Orleans was one of the three most likely potential disasters - after a terrorist attack on New York City . \nBut by 2003 the federal funding essentially dried up as it was drained into the Iraq war . \nBy 2004 , the Bush administration cut the corps of engineers ' request for holding back the waters of Lake Pontchartrain by more than 80 % . \nBy the beginning of this year , the administration 's additional cuts , reduced by 44 % since 2001 , forced the corps to impose a hiring freeze . \nThe Senate debated adding funds for fixing levees , but it was too late . \nThe New Orleans Times-Picayune , which before the hurricane published a series on the federal funding problem - whose presses are underwater and can now only put out an online edition - has reported : `` No one can say they did n't see it coming ... Now in the wake of one of the worst storms ever , serious questions are being asked about the lack of preparation . '' \nThe Bush administration 's policy of turning over wetlands to developers almost certainly has contributed to the heightened level of the storm surge . \nIn 1990 , a federal task force began restoring lost wetlands around New Orleans . \nEvery two miles of wetland between the Crescent City and the Gulf reduces a surge by half a foot . \nBush promised a `` no net loss '' wetland policy , which had been launched by his father 's administration and bolstered by President Clinton . \nBut he reversed the approach in 2003 , unleashing the developers . \nThe army corps of engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency announced they could no longer protect wetlands unless they were somehow related to interstate commerce . \nIn response to this potential crisis , four leading environmental groups conducted a study that concluded in 2004 that without wetlands protection New Orleans could be devastated by an ordinary - much less a category four or five - hurricane . \n`` There 's no way to describe how mindless a policy that is when it comes to wetlands protection , '' said one of the report 's authors . \nThe chairman of the White House 's council on environmental quality dismissed the study as `` highly questionable '' , and boasted : `` Everybody loves what we 're doing . '' \n`` My administration 's climate change policy will be science-based , '' President Bush declared . \nBut in 2002 , when the Environmental Protection Agency submitted a study on global warming to the UN , reflecting its expert research , Bush derided it as `` a report put out by a bureaucracy '' , and excised the climate change assessment from its annual report . \nThe next year , when the EPA issued its first comprehensive Report on the Environment , stating : `` Climate change has global consequences for human health and the environment '' , the White House simply removed the line and all such conclusions . \nAt the G8 meeting in Gleneagles this year , Bush stymied any common action on global warming . \nBut scientists have continued to accumulate impressive data on the rising temperature of the oceans , producing more severe hurricanes . \nIn February 2004 , 60 scientists warned in a statement , Restoring Scientific Integrity in Policymaking : `` Successful application of science has played a large part in the policies that have made the US the world 's most powerful nation and its citizens increasingly prosperous and healthy ... Indeed , this principle has long been adhered to by presidents and administrations of both parties in forming and implementing policies . \nThe administration of George W Bush has , however , disregarded this principle ... The distortion of scientific knowledge for partisan political ends must cease ... '' Bush ignored the statement . \nIn the two weeks preceding the storm , the trumping of science by ideology and expertise by special interests accelerated . \nThe Food and Drug Administration announced it was postponing sale of the morning-after pill , despite overwhelming scientific evidence of its safety and approval by the FDA 's scientific advisory board . \nThe UN special envoy for HIV\\/Aids in Africa accused the Bush administration of responsibility for a condom shortage in Uganda as a result of pushing its evangelical Christian agenda of `` abstinence '' . \nThe chief of the board of justice statistics in the justice department was ordered by the White House to delete its study that African-Americans and minorities are subject to racial profiling in police traffic stops . \nHe refused to concede and was forced to quit . \nWhen the army 's chief contracting oversight analyst objected to a $ 7bn no-bid contract awarded for work in Iraq to Halliburton , she was demoted despite her superior professional ratings . \nOn the day the levee burst in New Orleans , Bush delivered a speech comparing the Iraq war to the second world war and himself to Franklin D Roosevelt : `` And he knew that the best way to bring peace and stability to the region was by bringing freedom to Japan .

{"id": "255", "time": "2005-09-02", "text": "If you want to know what London was like in 1905 , come to Washington in 2005 . \nImperial gravitas and massive self-importance . \nThat sense of being the center of the world , and of needing to know what happens in every corner of the world because you might be called on - or at least feel called upon - to intervene there . \nAnd yet , gnawing away beneath the surface , the nagging fear that your global supremacy is not half so secure as you would wish . \nAs Joseph Chamberlain , the British colonial secretary , put it in 1902 : `` The weary Titan staggers under the too vast orb of his fate . '' \nThe United States is now that weary Titan . \nIn the British case , the angst was a result of the unexpectedly protracted , bloody and costly Boer war , in which a small group of foreign insurgents defied the mightiest military the world had seen ; concern about the rising economic power of Germany and the US ; and a combination of imperial overstretch with socio-economic problems at home . \nIn the American case , it 's a result of the unexpectedly protracted , bloody and costly Iraq war , in which a small group of foreign insurgents defies the mightiest military the world has seen ; concern about the rising economic power of China and India ; and a combination of imperial overstretch with socio-economic problems at home . \nIraq is America 's Boer war . \nRemember that after the British had declared the end of major combat operations in the summer of 1900 , the Boers launched a campaign of guerrilla warfare that kept British troops on the run for another two years . \nThe British won only by a ruthlessness of which , I 'm glad to say , the democratic , squeamish and still basically anti-colonialist US appears incapable . \nIn the end , the British had 450,000 British and colonial troops there -LRB- compared with some 150,000 US troops in Iraq -RRB- , and herded roughly a quarter of the Boer population into concentration camps , where many died . \nIn a recent CNN\\/Gallup poll , 54 % of those asked said it was a mistake to send American troops into Iraq , and 57 % said the Iraq war has made the US less safe from terrorism . \nThe protest camp outside President Bush 's ranch in Crawford , which grew around the mother of a soldier who died in Iraq , exemplifies the pain . \nCNN has aired a documentary explaining in detail how the intelligence on Saddam 's weapons of mass destruction was distorted , abused , sexed up and , as the program was entitled , Dead Wrong . \nThis will hardly be news for British or European readers , but the facts have not been so widely aired in the US . \nIn another poll , the number of those who rated the president as `` honest '' fell below 50 % for the first time . \nHe has again attempted to bolster support for his administration and his war . \nIt does n't seem to be working . \nA recent article in the New York Times plausibly estimated the prospective long-term cost of the Iraq War at more than $ 1 trillion . \nNow that Iraqi politicians have finally agreed a draft constitution for their country , only the world 's greatest optimist can believe that it will turn Iraq into a peaceful democratic federal republic . \nIncreasingly , the Islamic Republic of Iran quietly calls the shots in the Shia south of Iraq . \nAs the Washington joke goes : the war is over , and the Iranians won . \nMeanwhile oil prices of $ 70 a barrel put the price of petrol at American pumps up to $ 3 a gallon for basic unleaded fuel . \nFor someone from Europe this is still unbelievably cheap , but you should hear the shrieks of agony . \n`` Gas prices have changed my life , '' moaned a distressed California commuter . \nIf higher energy prices persist , they threaten not just a still vibrant economy but a whole way of life , symbolised by the Hummer . \nBesides instability in the Middle East , the main force pushing up oil prices is the relentless growth of demand for energy from the emerging economic giants of Asia . \nThe Chinese go around the world quietly signing big oil supply deals with any oil-producing country they can find , however nasty its politics , including Sudan and Iran . \nWhen a Chinese concern tried to buy a big California energy company , that was too much - American politicians screamed and effectively blocked the deal . \nChina and India are to the US today what Germany and America were to Britain a hundred years ago . \nChina is now the world 's second-largest energy consumer , after the US . \nIt also has the world 's second-largest foreign currency reserves , after Japan and followed by Taiwan , South Korea and India . \nIn the foreign reserve stakes , the US comes only ninth , after Singapore and just before Malaysia . \nAccording to some economists , the US has an effective net savings rate - taking account of all public spending and debt - of zero . \nIt does not save ; it spends . \nTV channels are full oof commercials , enticing you to spend , spend , spend - and then to `` consolidate '' your debt in one easy package . \nNone of this is to suggest that the US will decline and fall tomorrow . \nAfter all , the British empire lasted for another 40 years after 1905 . \nIn fact , it grew to its largest extent after 1918 , before it signed its own death warrant by expending its blood and treasure to defeat Adolf Hitler -LRB- not the worst way to go -RRB- . \nSimilarly , one may anticipate that America 's informal empire - its network of military bases and semi-protectorates - will continue to grow . \nThe US , like Edwardian Britain , still has formidable resources of economic , technological and military power , cultural attractiveness and , not least , the will to stay on top . \nAs one British music hall ditty at that time proclaimed : And we mean to be top dog still . \nYes , we mean to be top dog still . \nYou do n't have to go very far to hear that refrain in Washington today . \nThe Bush administration 's national security strategy makes no bones about the goal of maintaining military supremacy . \nBut whether the `` American century '' that began in 1945 will last until 2045 , 2035 or only 2025 , its end can already be glimpsed on the horizon . \nIf you are , by any chance , of that persuasion that would instinctively find this a cause for rejoicing , pause for a moment to consider two things : first , that major shifts of power between rising and falling great powers have usually been accompanied by major wars ; and second , that the next top dog could be a lot worse . \nSo this is no time for schadenfreude . \nIt 's a time for critical solidarity . \nA few far-sighted people in Washington are beginning to formulate a long-term American strategy of trying to create an international order that would protect the interests of liberal democracies even when American hyperpower has faded ; and to encourage rising powers such as India and China to sign up to such an order . \nThat is exactly what today 's weary Titan should be doing , and we should help him do it . \n"}
{"id": "107", "time": "2005-11-07", "text": "Blair 's litany of failures on Iraq - ambassador 's damning verdict Meyer says PM failed to exert any leverage on Bush and was seduced by US power President Bush with Tony Blair in the Blue Room at the White House a few hours before addressing Congress and the nation on September 20 2001 . \nSir Christopher , highly critical of Mr Blair 's performance in the run-up to the war , argues the prime minister and his team were `` seduced '' by the proximity and glamour of US power and reluctant to negotiate conditions with George Bush for Britain 's support for the war . \nHe says Mr Blair failed to exploit his enormous leverage with Mr Bush not only to secure a precious delay but to plan for postwar Iraq . \n`` We may have been the junior partner in the enterprise but the ace up our sleeve was that America did not want to go it alone . \nHad Britain so insisted , Iraq after Saddam might have avoided the violence that may yet prove fatal to the entire enterprise . '' \nBut Mr Blair did not have any appetite for bargaining with Mr Bush , according to Sir Christopher : `` Tony Blair chose to take his stand against Saddam and alongside President Bush from the highest of high moral ground . \nIt is the definitive riposte to Blair the Poodle , seduced though he and his team always appeared to be by the proximity and glamour of American power . \n`` But the high moral ground , and the pure white flame of unconditional support to an ally in service of an idea , have their disadvantages . \nThey place your destiny in the hands of an ally . \nThey fly above the tangled history of Sunni , Shia , Kurd , Turkomen and Assyrian . \nThey discourage descent into the dull detail of tough and necessary bargaining : meat and drink to Margaret Thatcher but , so it seemed , uncongenial to Tony Blair . '' \nThe former diplomat accuses Mr Blair of weakness in failing to engage Mr Bush in the `` plain-speaking conversation '' that needed to take place . \n`` Had Blair told Bush in clear and explicit terms that he would be unable to support a war unless British wishes were met ? \nI doubted it . '' \nThe Washington embassy repeatedly advised Downing Street to use its leverage , but was ignored . \nDelaying the invasion from March to the autumn would have allowed the United Nations weapons inspectors extra months to establish whether Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction , enabled the US and Britain to reach an understanding with France and Russia , two of the biggest sceptics about war , and increased international support , instead of going to war `` in the company of a motley ad hoc coalition of allies '' . \nThe former diplomat , who enjoyed unparalleled access to all the key members of Mr Bush 's administration and supported the war , provides the most detailed account yet of the thinking inside the White House and Downing Street in the 18 months running up to the invasion in March 2003 . \nHe says of the war now : `` History 's verdict looks likely to be that it was terminally flawed both in conception and execution . '' \nPublication comes at a time when Mr Blair is vulnerable domestically , and the indictment of Lewis `` Scooter '' Libby , the chief of staff of Vice-President Dick Cheney , has reopened the debate in the US about why the country went to war . \nSir Christopher records a conversation with Mr Libby who told him `` we were the only ally that mattered . \nThat was a powerful lever '' . \nBut the former ambassador says London `` was not fertile ground for the notion of leverage or the tough negotiating position that must sometimes be taken even with the closest allies - as Churchill did with Roosevelt and Thatcher did with Reagan '' . \nHe regrets that at precisely the moment that Mr Blair should have been bargaining , in the early autumn of 2002 , `` political energy in London had become consumed by a titanic struggle to keep public opinion , parliament and the Labor party onside for war . \nThere was little energy left in No 10 to think about the aftermath . \nSince Downing Street drove Iraq policy , efforts made by the Foreign Office to engage with the Americans on the subject came to nothing . '' \nHe questions whether No 10 relied too heavily on British military and intelligence advisers fatalistic about the inevitability of war and `` as a consequence underestimated its political leverage and ability to affect the course of events '' . \nHe takes a swipe at John Scarlett , chairman of the joint intelligence committee , which was responsible for assessing intelligence , and one of the main authors of the controversial British dossier making a case against Saddam . \nSir Christopher , who at one time was lined up to be head of the JIC , said he understood why Alastair Campbell , Mr Blair 's press secretary , wanted as categorical a public depiction of Saddam 's threat as possible . \n`` Equally , I would have expected the JIC to be rigorous in telling me how far I could go . '' \nOne of Sir Christopher 's main charges is that Mr Blair failed to puncture the US administration 's belief that it would be `` sweetness and light in Iraq '' after the war , and the descent of Iraq into chaos today is , in part , a result of this . \nSir Christopher recounts how Mr Bush told the inner circle at a US-British summit at Camp David in 2002 that the prime minister had `` cojones '' -LRB- balls -RRB- . \nThe former ambassador says Britain should have taken advantage of such praise , making its participation in the war dependent on a fully worked-out plan for postwar Iraq , which he describes as `` defective '' and `` rudimentary '' . \n`` This would have been the appropriate quid pro quo for Blair 's display of cojones at this Camp David meeting with Bush . '' \nHe is adamant Mr Bush was amenable to pressure almost to the end . \n`` Indeed , if it all went wrong at the UN , and the US was faced with going to war alone , it seemed to me that Bush might blink . \nOr , to put it another way : what Britain decided to do could be the decisive factor in the White House . '' \nThe former ambassador says a delay from March to autumn 2003 could have made a significant difference : `` Even if the most optimistic predictions are finally realized for Iraq , the question will still be asked : why did the Americans and British make it so hard for themselves and even harder for Iraqis ? \nThe US and the UK would have stood a better chance of going to war in good order , and of doing the aftermath right , had they planned on an autumn , not a spring , campaign . '' \nHe reveals that Karl Rove , the political adviser to the president , told him there would have been no problem for Mr Bush in waiting until the end of 2003 or even early 2004 and this would not have risked entanglement in the US presidential campaign . \n"}

'' \nThe briefing was on the record but under embassy rules the official could not be named . \nHe did not elaborate on the substance of the talks and it was unclear which of the insurgency 's numerous groups had been engaged . \nThe contacts , conducted mainly through Sunni Arab tribal and religious leaders , were limited to factions which could be coaxed away from violence and into mainstream politics , the official added . \nThat ruled out Abu Musab al-Zarqawi 's al-Qaida in Iraq and other radical Islamic groups believed responsible for most of the suicide bombings . \n`` Some insurgents are irredeemable and have to be dealt with in a purely military way . '' \nThe US has made public overtures to Iraq 's Sunni Arabs , a disaffected minority driving the insurgency , but until now drew the line at contacts with the `` terrorists '' denounced by President Bush . \nThe administration has come under increasing pressure to show progress in a war which claims approximately two American lives daily and is blamed for shortfalls in army recruitment . \nA recent Gallup poll showed 57 % of Americans do not believe it was worth invading in March 2003 . \nIt is no secret that some US commanders on the ground have informal and indirect contacts with their opponents , mostly via Sunni mosques and tribal elders . \nThe embassy official suggested those channels have become more formalised . \nThe insurgency is a complex mix of criminal gangs , Sunni Arab nationalists , former members of Saddam Hussein 's Ba'ath regime and Islamic radicals , with many foreigners among the latter . \nTwo years ago Mr Bush 's response was `` Bring 'em on '' . \nBut as casualties soared and the nascent Iraqi state reeled , the US reached out to the Ba'athists and Sunnis , encouraging , for example , the country 's new Shia and Kurdish rulers to scale back purges known as `` de-Ba ` athification '' . \nEarlier this week an Arab Sunni politician and former electricity minister , Ayham al-Samarie , said two groups , the Islamic Army in Iraq and the Army of Mujahideen , were ready to talk to the government . \nThe prime minister , Ibrahim al-Jaafari , said yesterday he hoped to draw `` all sectors '' of Iraqi society into the political process and hinted that this included homegrown insurgents . \nThe ruling Shia and Kurdish coalition promised to give Sunni Arabs a greater role in writing a new constitution by increasing their membership on the drafting committee , where they occupy two out of 55 seats . \nSome officials said Sunnis would be given an additional 13 seats , matching Kurdish representation , but President Jalal Talabani , himself a Kurd , said the government would meet Sunni demands for an extra 20 to 25 seats . \nThe British foreign secretary , Jack Straw , visiting Baghdad as part of a European Union delegation , expressed confidence that Iraq would have a referendum-approved constitution and elections by the end of the year . \nThe delegation also pledged financial support for Iraq . \n"}

' \nWhat this meant was expensive lawyers were busy devising methods of circumventing those laws . \nAn article in a recent New Yorker describes the vogue for outsourcing torture . \nSuspects abducted by the CIA are loaded in shackles onto executive jets , and delivered to countries such as Egypt , Syria and Jordan whose secret police have robust ways of asking questions . \nMark Danner - toiling through official reports and transcripts of interviews with prisoners and witnesses , as well as conducting his own investigation in Iraq - has exposed the false piety in disavowals of responsibility by Bush and Donald Rumsfeld , and established official complicity in the abuse . \nThe moral corruption began , of course , from the obfuscation of language . \nIt 's easy to lie if you muddle up the definition of truth ; abominable acts can be made defensible if you call them by another name . \nNo one in Apocalypse Now tells Willard to murder Kurtz . \nThey simply say that the colonel 's command must be ` terminated ' , and when the assassin blinks uncomprehending they add that the termination must occur ` with extreme prejudice ' . \nThe military bureaucrats on whom Danner eavesdrops employ the same elevated , evasive diction . \nA colonel justifies the use of ` sleep deprivation ' at Guantnamo by saying that such measures are ` probably within the lexicon ' . \nThat mental torment thus becomes a mere word , a quaint lexical curio . \nFrom there it 's a short step to the paraphrase employed at Abu Ghraib , where keeping cells lit 24 hours a day is called ` sleep adjustment ' , as if it were therapeutic . \nThe CIA specialises in such neologisms . \nBeatings , for instance , are glossed as ` enhanced interrogation techniques ' : imagine how your life would be enhanced by a battery of fists , whips and cattle prods . \nSuch enhancement is a privilege , lavished only on guests whom the agency classifies as its ` high value detainees ' . \nJargon is anesthetic ; it stops your ears to the cries of your victims , and like a beta blocker suppresses whatever humane sensitivity you may still possess . \nThus the torturers , theorising about ` prisoner-guard interactions ' , could describe themselves as artists who competed with each other to devise more ` creative ' forms of aggression . \nDanner 's documents reveal what that creativity entailed . \nIt had become banal , when ` fearing up ' detainees , to see them piss themselves in terror . \nSuch victories were facile , so a prize was awarded to whoever could make a man defecate by threatening him . \nDetainees were handcuffed together , then ordered them to crawl on the floor while being choked or hosed down or pummelled . \nThe thugs who supervised the revels imagined they were making music : a report on one such session names the soldiers by whom it was ` orchestrated ' . \nLatinate terminology is useful because it remains unintelligible . \nSlang also comes in handy , since it 's a terse shorthand whose precise meaning is unfixed , not yet inscribed in the lexicon . \nA lieutenant-colonel , taking delivery of four Iraqi generals , ordered a corporal to ` Strip them out and PT them ' . \nDid stripping out mean denuding them , or placing them in isolation ? \nPT is physical training : did that prescribe gymnastics or a punch-up ? \nThe vagueness of the order , as a report concluded , ` could have led to any subsequent abuse ' . \nBut it could hardly be abusive , since its purpose was to ` soften up ' the detainees . \nIs n't softness synonymous with clemency and kindness ? \nAccusations of wrongdoing lose their force because words have been so bled of meaning . \nA report decides that ` the use of nudity was sanctioned at some level within the chain of command ' . \nBut ` sanction ' gestures towards sanctity . \nUsed to approve torture , it ca n't help sanctifying the torturer . \nHalf way through 500 pages of such brain-befuddling gobbledegook , Danner inserts eight pages of photographs - the cheery holiday snaps of Private Lyndie Englund and her gloating , sadistic cronies , who have piled up naked Iraqis into pyramids ` for the fun of it ' or smeared them in shit or paraded them so that their fearfully shrivelled penises can be laughed at . \nJames Schlesinger , the former defense secretary , disposed of this obscene album by referring to a comic film : Abu Ghraib , he said , was ' Animal House on the nightshift ' . \nBut these were not the frat-house rampages of John Belushi and his swinish , beer-swilling buddies . \nDanner prefers a loftier cultural reference , and says that the detainees were put through a ` Dantesque nightmare journey ' . \nFor me , it all looks less like Dante 's inferno than the coprophiliac hell imagined by Bosch : a pornotopia where bowel movements are the answers to barked questions , and prisoners after being half-drowned in vats of urine are told to lap up meals that have been dumped in the toilet . \nThe images , foul as they are , come as a relief after so much verbose hypocrisy . \nBush may prate about the gospel of freedom , but Danner quotes an Iraqi who says that the American liberators have merely brought ` the freedom of rape , the freedom of nudity and the freedom of humiliation ' . \nTorture was supposed to extract truth from the captives . \nTruth , however , was the first casualty of this unending and ineffectual war . \n"}

' \nI would not take anything the North Koreans say at face value , ' said Paul Leventhal , president of the Nuclear Control Institute . \nBut most experts accept such sentiments afford little comfort . \nNow the focus of dealing with North Korea has become working out what sort of nuclear devices North Korea might possess and how it could deliver them . \nThough it has no missiles that could reach America , South Korea lies just over the border . \nTokyo is just a short flight over the Sea of Japan . \nIt could easily use a plane or a boat to deliver a nuclear device . \nThat could see the triggering of a regional nuclear arms race in Asia , a continent already scarred by the nuclear standoff between Indian and Pakistan . \nWith North Korea boasting a nuclear arsenal , South Korea is under enormous pressure to follow suit as a deterrent . \nJapan too could see nuclear weapons as its only insurance against assault . \nWith its hi-tech economy many people believe Japan could develop weapons in a matter of weeks or months , not years . \nBut if this happens then China , motivated by longstanding fears over its advanced neighbor , will likely move to increase its own nuclear weapons arsenal and develop more advanced delivery systems . \nSuddenly , the nuclear club will start to look very crowded . \nCertainly Iran appears to want to join despite intensive diplomacy from a trio of European nations . \nMany experts put that down to a failure of US policy . \nIran 's leaders have looked at the contrasting fates of Iraq , which was invaded for weapons it did not have , and North Korea , which has confessed to developing nuclear weapons and now appears immune to any military threat . \nWith the Bush administration openly bent on ` regime change ' in Iran , the safest route for the country 's reigning mullahs seems obvious . \n` Iran has learned that lesson . \nThey want to go the North Korea route , not the Iraq route , ' Goldring said . \nThat has led to a dangerous game of brinkmanship in a Middle East destined to become a theater of conflict where nuclear weapons are suddenly a real possibility . \nIsrael already has the bomb . \nIran , surrounded by American allies and soldiers , wants it too . \nSome experts think it is too late to stop Iran from going nuclear , no matter how many official denials Tehran puts out about its intentions . \nOthers believe there is still hope . \n` We need to make a concerted effort and engage with the process , ' said Peter Pella , a former proliferation expert at the US State Department . \nThe Bush administration is taking an opposite tack . \nIn an international version of ` good cop , bad cop ' European nations are holding discussions with Iran about its nuclear program , while the US makes hostile noises . \nFew experts failed to notice Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice 's recent remarks that attacking Iran was ' ... not on the agenda at this point ' . \nThat has some US hawks on the Iranian situation delighted . \n` We need a stick to use , ' said Leventhal . \n` The Europeans will have heard the ` not on the agenda ' part , but the Iranians will have head the ` at this point ' part . ' \nWhatever the approach , few believe that the Iranian nuclear issue is anything but a potentially catastrophic powder keg . \nIf Iran pushes ahead , then Israel could launch strikes against possible nuclear facilities , just as it did in Iraq in the 1980s . \nSuch a move could easily ignite a major war across the region . \nThe crisis is brewing to a boil and no real solution is yet in sight . \nBut the nuclear threat of the 21st century comes from terrorist groups , not just rogue states . \nIt is no longer governments who are the most likely to spread nukes or the technology to make them . \nAnd it is no longer states who are most likely to use them . \nMilitants such as Osama bin Laden have said that they would use nuclear weapons . \nAl-Qaeda are known to have acquired plans for the manufacture of nuclear arms . \nIntelligence services know meetings occurred between al-Qaeda representatives and nuclear scientists before 11 September . \nIslamic militants have since negotiated to buy what they thought was weapons-grade uranium from criminals . \n` The intent is there , ' said one Western intelligence source . \n` The question is whether any militant organization - particularly one that is being chased by the most powerful nation in the world - could build the facilities to create and weaponise a nuclear armament , even some kind of `` suitcase bomb '' style device . \nThe answer is `` probably no '' . ' \nInstead , most experts agree , the main threat comes from a basic radiological device - or dirty bomb . \nThis would be a conventional bomb laced with radioactive material - perhaps only an element from a hospital x-ray machine . \nAccording to a report to be published next week by the British American Security Information Council , the radiological impact of a dirty bomb is uncertain . \nIn 1987 the Iraqi army tested a large radiological bomb for possible use in the Iran-Iraq war , but abandoned the plan because the radiation levels produced were not considered high enough . \nBut dirty bombs do have two advantages for terrorists . \nFirst , they could cause widespread panic and chaos . \nSecond , the cost of the cleanup , and the implications of having large parts of a city center rendered unusable , would be massive . \nThere are also fears that North Korea or Iran may give nuclear technology to militants , or rogue scientists selling secrets or nuclear materials . \nA recent example is that of Abdul Qadeer Khan , the father of Pakistan 's nuclear program , who reportedly made himself a fortune of more than $ 400m in a 15 year career of selling nuclear secrets to North Korea , Libya and , quite possibly , Iran . \nWorking through scores of offshore accounts and cut-out companies , Khan 's network stretched from South Africa to Morocco to Singapore . \nTurkish and Malaysian workshops made parts for centrifuges , Italian factories made furnaces , a German supplier provided vacuum pumps . \nThough the CIA have claimed they had penetrated the network , it is still thought Khan was able to visit North Korea more than a dozen times to swap Pakistani centrifuge technology for local missile know-how , pass uranium enrichment technology to Iran and to give Libya blue prints for a bomb . \nThere are dangers everywhere . \nMany fear General Pervaiz Musharraf 's pro-Western government in Pakistan , which already has the bomb , could be replaced by a harder line Islamic regime . \nAnd there are problems with former Soviet stocks . \nRussia alone has hundreds of metric tonnes of weapons grade materials such as enriched uranium . \nThe prospect of a nuclear attack by terrorists on a Western city is more possible now than at any time . \n` If a nuclear weapon went off in a city somewhere , it would not surprise me at all , ' said Leventhal . \nIt is not all doom and gloom . \nLibya has come in from the diplomatic cold , giving up its nuclear ambitions . \nAnd there is now little possibility of a nuclear-armed Iraq threatening the Middle East . \nBut in general the situation looks bleak . \nIt has been more than 30 years since the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty was created . \nIt was designed to discourage nations from developing nuclear weapons in return for access to nuclear power and an obligation on behalf of the big powers to work towards nuclear disarmament . \nThe treaty will be reviewed this May in New York at a time when it seems no one is abiding by it . \nIt is likely that the issue of Iran will dominate the meeting . \nOne senior Western European diplomat told The Observer the atmosphere was likely to be ` poisoned ' by the acrimonious debate over policy towards Tehran . \n` It is a treaty concerned not only with stopping the further spread of nukes but also about their complete elimination , ' said Dr Stephen Pullinger , of Saferworld , an independent foreign affairs think tank . \n` Instead , it is clear that none of the five declared nuclear states are thinking about abandoning their nukes for the foreseeable future . ' \nAs Iran and North Korea stand in the dock in May it may well be worth remembering the Non-Proliferation was meant to work both ways . \n"}

although we will fight using our industrial power , our collective strength as a union , and as a part of civil society which needs to grow in order to defeat both still-powerful Saddamist elites and the foreign occupation of our country . \nBush and Blair should remember that those who voted in last month 's elections in Iraq are as hostile to the occupation as those who boycotted them . \nThose who claim to represent the Iraqi working class while calling for the occupation to stay a bit longer , due to `` fears of civil war '' , are in fact speaking only for themselves and the minority of Iraqis whose interests are dependent on the occupation . \nWe as a union call for the withdrawal of foreign occupation forces and their military bases . \nWe do n't want a timetable - this is a stalling tactic . \nWe will solve our own problems . \nWe are Iraqis , we know our country and we can take care of ourselves . \nWe have the means , the skills and resources to rebuild and create our own democratic society . \nHassan Juma'a Awad is general secretary of Iraq 's Southern Oil Company Union and president of the Basra Oil Workers ' Union Letters for publication should be sent to : letters@guardian.co.uk If you need help using the site : userhelp@guardian.co.uk Call the main Guardian and Observer switchboard : Follow all the top stories of the day on Twitter with the Guardian 's world news team john_hooper : #Benedict decided to resign after visit to Mexico & Cuba last March , says tonight 's edition of #pope 's daily L'Osservatore Romano #news \n"}

'' \nThe detainee withdrew his charges on November 23 2003 . \nHe says he was told : `` You will stay in the prison for a long time , and you will never get out until you are 50 years old . '' \nA medical examination by a US military doctor confirmed the detainee 's account , yet the investigation was closed last October . \n`` It is further proof that the army is not seriously investigating credible allegations of abuse , '' said Jameel Jaffar , a lawyer for the ACLU . \nThe latest allegations from Afghanistan fit a pattern of claims of brutal treatment made by former Guantnamo Bay prisoners and Afghans held by the US , and reported by the Guardian last year . \nIn December the US said eight prisoners had died in its custody in Afghanistan . \nIn a separate case , which the Guardian reveals today , two former prisoners of the US in Afghanistan have come forward with claims against their American captors . \nIn sworn affidavits to a British-American human rights lawyer , a Palestinian says he was sodomised by American soldiers in Afghanistan . \nAnother former prisoner of US forces , a Jordanian , describes a form of torture which involved being hung in a cage from a rope for days . \nBoth men were freed from US detention last year after being held in Afghanistan and Guantnamo Bay . \nNeither has been charged by any government with any offence . \nHussain Adbulkadr Youssouf Mustafa , a Palestinian living in Jordan , told the lawyer , Clive Stafford-Smith , that he was sodomised by US soldiers during his detention at Bagram air force base in 2002 . \nHe claims to have been blindfolded , tightly handcuffed , gagged and had his ears plugged , forced to bend down over a table by two soldiers , with a third soldier pressing his face down on the table , and to have had his trousers pulled down . \n`` They forcibly rammed a stick up my rectum , '' he reports . \n`` It was excruciatingly painful ... Only when the pain became overwhelming did I think I would ever scream . \nBut I could not stop screaming when this happened . '' \nIn a second affidavit , the Jordanian citizen , Wesam Abdulrahman Ahmed Al Deemawi , detained from March 15 2002 to March 31 2004 , says that during a 40-day period of detention at Bagram he was threatened with dogs , stripped and photographed `` in shameful and obscene positions '' and placed in a cage with a hook and a hanging rope . \nHe says he was hung from this hook , blindfolded , for two days although he was occasionally given hour-long `` breaks '' . \nThe Guardian asked the US military 's central command , which has responsibility for Afghanistan , to respond to the allegations on Wednesday . \nBy the time of going to press last night no response had been received other than an email from a Major Steven Wollman in Kabul , saying he was researching the question . \n"}

'' \nRelations have worsened following accusations by Sheikh Harith al-Dhari , the leader of the Sunni clerics ' association , that the Badr Brigades had orchestrated the killing of a number of prominent Sunni figures . \nBadr Brigades ' leaders denied that and in return accused Sunni clerics of failing to denounce the insurgency and of fomenting sectarian conflict . \nThe fresh attempt at mediation came as news emerged of the killing of 10 Shia pilgrims as they were returning from Syria . \nAt a funeral on Saturday for four of the victims in the mostly Shia city of Diwaniyah , about 100 miles south of Baghdad , mourners chanted `` revenge , revenge '' . \nIt followed a week of violence across Iraq which saw a wave of car bombs , suicide attacks and assassinations aimed at mostly Shia targets . \n`` Ordinary Shia Muslims have been killed as they pray , as they marry , as they buy food , '' said Sheikh Araji . \n`` Enough is enough . \nWe must defend ourselves . \nBut we must not retaliate through violence . '' \nThe country 's most senior Shia cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani has also urged Shias to refrain from retaliation . \nA western diplomat in Baghdad said : `` Since the fall of Saddam Hussein there has been little to no attempt at national reconciliation from the political and religious leaders . \nAnd unless that happens soon we may see more of see this kind of revenge killing . '' \nThe interior ministry said police accepted that the killings appeared to be on the increase . \nDespite the peace talks , the Sunni Arab minority , once all-powerful but now alienated and marginalised , remain angry . \nAt Friday prayers in Hassanein mosque in the west Baghdad district of Amiriya the imam , Adnan Abdul Wahab al-Ani , said : `` Saddam oppressed all Iraqi peoples without distinction , but now there is just one group being oppressed - the Sunnis . '' \nAfter the sermon Sheikh Ani told the Guardian : `` We are not accusing the Shia people , just the Badr Brigades ... someone is killing Sunni religious people and politicians . '' \nHe said that in recent months , 152 Sunni mosques had been raided , while 14 sheikhs and 62 worshippers had been killed . \nOutside the mosque young men distributed DVDs promoting the militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi . \nIn the nearby market , flyers were handed out that excoriated the `` bullshit Shia '' for cooperating with the Badr Brigades and for `` welcoming Iran into Iraq '' . \nThe Badr Brigade was set up by Iraqi Shia exiles in Iran under the aegis of the Iranian government . \nOne Sunni sheikh , Khalaf al-Aliyan , said Shia political parties had a hit-list targeting 4,000 Sunni Arabs but this was vehemently denied by Shia leaders . \n"}

'' \nMr Mousa dabbed his eyes with a handkerchief and the other hand gripped a mobile phone so tightly the knuckles gleamed . \n`` Baha did everything for us . \nI think we 'll never get over it . '' \nMembers of the Queen 's Lancashire Regiment allegedly beat Baha Mousa , 26 , a hotel receptionist in the southern Iraqi city of Basra , to death in September 2003 . \nFour days after he was seized with six colleagues in a raid on the hotel , his father identified his battered corpse at the British military morgue . \nAt least four QLR soldiers face charges of murder and abuse and yesterday it was reported that they and another seven soldiers and officers could face wider war crimes charges under legislation enacted in 2001 after the establishment of the International Criminal Court . \nThe Army Prosecuting Authority has apparently yet to finalize its decision on who will be prosecuted , and on what charges , but the revelation that war crimes may be included in the charge sheet was welcomed by the victim 's father . \nThe nuances of international law and legal precedent held little interest for Mr Mousa , but he hoped the development would bring justice and compensation a step closer . \n`` The punishment for the killers is for British law to decide . \nBut if it was here in Iraq , and it was my choice , I would say execute them . '' \nA police colonel built like a wrestler , he spoke softly as tears rolled down his cheeks . \nOn the sofa beside him , his two orphaned grandsons , Hussein , 7 , and Hassan , 5 , fidgeted and smiled , aware they were the focus of the assembled adults but unsure why . \nHussein is the image of his father . \nHe has had trouble settling into school and is hyperactive . \nHassan resembles his mother . \nShe succumbed to cancer six months before their father died . \nAfter that Baha would sleep between the boys . \nOn monthly visits to his grave , they expect to see him and they return home to Basra disappointed and puzzled , said relatives . \n`` When they see British patrols in the streets they point and say ` Those men killed my father ' , '' said Mr Mousa . \n`` But they do n't really understand . '' \nThe occupation was six months old in September 2003 and the British-controlled port city was febrile , with sporadic attacks on British forces , when the soldiers raided the Ibn Al Haitham hotel . \nThey found five assault rifles and two pistols used for hotel security . \nUnable to locate their quarry , one of the hotel 's owners , they took Baha and six colleagues to the British military base . \nAccording to Kifah Taha , 46 , a maintenance engineer who was one of the six , beatings started immediately . \nThere was a competition to see which soldier could kickbox a prisoner the furthest , he claimed . \nEach prisoner was allegedly given a footballer 's name and beaten if he failed to remember it . \nFreezing water was allegedly poured through hoods placed over their heads . \nBaha suffered the most and on the second night he was taken to another room from which Mr Taha said he could hear him moaning `` Blood . \nThere 's blood coming from my nose . \nI 'm going to die . '' \nAfter punches and kicks , Mr Taha 's kidneys failed and he nearly died . \nHe and the other five survivors were eventually released without charge . \nBacked by human rights advocacy groups , including the UK-based Iraqi League , last year the six men launched a high court challenge to the government 's refusal to order independent inquiries into the deaths . \nBack at work yesterday , fixing the hotel 's generator , Mr Taha said he still had nightmares . \n`` When I see the British in the streets , my soul leaves my body and I remember the day I was arrested . '' \nArmy prosecutors have been under pressure to act since the high court ruled last December that the UK had broken the Human Rights Act by failing to prevent Mr Mousa 's death or to prosecute his alleged assailants . \nBritish officers have visited the family home in the Kafa hat suburb of west Basra several times to apologise . \nAs a senior police officer , Baha 's father works with and respects most British soldiers . \n`` They make a good impression . \nWe tackle terrorism together . '' \nBut he said he rejected as an insult the offer of $ 8,000 compensation , contrasting it with the $ 10m Libya agreed to pay for each victim of the Lockerbie bombing . \n`` Is an Arab life worth so much less ? \nAre Arabs less human ? '' \nHowever , despite the delay in prosecuting the case , Baha 's father expressed confidence in British justice . \n`` I think everyone is under the law in your country . \nI visited London and the people were friendly , they did not like what had happened to my family .

{"id": "26", "time": "2005-02-27", "text": "There are not many newspaper articles that can genuinely claim to have changed the world for the better . \nBut on Sunday , 28 May 1961 , The Observer published a campaigning piece on the front of its Weekend Review section . \nThe article was entitled ` The Forgotten Prisoners ' and it was by Peter Benenson , a 40-year old Eton-educated London lawyer . \nBenenson had been angered after learning about two Portuguese students who had been arrested and imprisoned for seven years after drinking a toast to liberty in a Lisbon cafe during the Salazar dictatorship . \nAs Benenson later said : ` That so enraged me that I walked up the steps of St Martin-in-the-Fields , out of the Underground , and went in to see what could really be done effectively to mobilise world opinion . ' \nHis solution seemed simple : to bombard the Portuguese regime with written protests . \nAs Martin Ennals , a future Amnesty secretary-general observed later , it was ` an amazing contention that prisoners of conscience could be released by writing letters to governments ' . \nBut rather than have just one campaign for one country , why not draw public attention to the plight of political and religious prisoners throughout the world ? \nThis was the basis of his Observer article , which took the shape of a series of letters published as an ` Appeal for Amnesty ' . \nHis article began : ` Open your newspaper - any day of the week - and you will find a report from somewhere in the world of someone being imprisoned , tortured or executed because his opinions or religion are unacceptable to his government . \nThe newspaper reader feels a sickening sense of impotence . \nYet if these feelings of disgust all over the world could be united into common action , something effective could be done . ' \nHe could not have predicted how right he has proved to be . \nBenenson had intended his campaign to run for a year , but the response to his article was overwhelming . \nThe term ` prisoner of conscience ' , which he coined , soon became common currency and the movement 's logo , a candle surrounded by barbed wire , became a worldwide symbol of hope . \nAmnesty 's campaigns have saved countless prisoners from torture or death . \nFrom South Africa , Chile and Uganda to Iraq , Burma and China , Amnesty 's work has helped secure the release of political prisoners and highlighted human rights violations . \nCloser to home Amnesty has also been critical of policies of the former prime minister , Margaret Thatcher , and more recently Tony Blair 's anti-terrorist legislation . \nIrene Khan , its present secretary general , said yesterday : ` His vision gave birth to human rights activism . \nPeter Benenson 's life was a courageous testament to his visionary commitment to fight injustice around the world . \nHe brought light into the darkness of prisons , the horror of torture chambers and tragedy of death camps around the world . \n` This was a man whose conscience shone in a cruel and terrifying world , who believed in the power of ordinary people to bring about extraordinary change and , by creating Amnesty International , he gave each of us the opportunity to make a difference . ' \nThe Leader of the House of Commons , Peter Hain , a long-time campaigner against the former apartheid regime in South Africa , led the political tributes last night . \n` He lit a torch for human rights which Amnesty International has kept burning across the world in being constantly vigilant about abuses , ' Hain said . \nIn Amnesty 's first few years Benenson 's energy was vital to its success . \nHe provided much of its funding and was involved in all aspects of the organization . \n` At that time we were still putting our toes in the water and learning as we went on , ' he later said . \n` We tried every technique of publicity and we were very grateful for the widespread help of journalists and television crews throughout the world who not only sent us information about the names of prisoners but also , whenever they could , gave space to stories about prisoners . ' \nAmnesty 's membership is now more than a million , with supporters in more than 160 countries and territories . \nIt has dealt with the cases of 47,000 prisoners of conscience and other victims of human rights violation . \nMore than 45,000 of these are now closed . \nIn 1977 Amnesty International was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for its tireless fight against injustice . \nFormer prisoner of conscience Julio de Pena Valdez , a trade union leader in the Dominican Republic , has spoken of the impact of an Amnesty letter-writing campaign . \n` When the 200 letters came , the guards gave me back my clothes . \nThen the next 200 letters came and the prison director came to see me . \nWhen the next pile of letters arrived , the director got in touch with his superior . \nThe letters kept coming and coming - 3,000 of them . \nThe president was informed . \n` The letters still kept arriving and the president called the prison and told them to let me go . ' \nBenenson was born on 31 July 1921 , the grandson of the Russian-Jewish banker Grigori Benenson . \nHe later converted to Catholicism . \nHe was tutored privately by WH Auden , then went to Eton and Oxford , where he studied history . \nHis flair for controversy emerged early , when his complaint to the headmaster of Eton about the poor quality of the school 's food prompted a letter to his mother warning of her son 's ` revolutionary tendencies . \nAt age 16 , he launched his first campaign : to get school support , during the Spanish Civil War , for the newly-formed Spanish Relief Committee which was helping Republican war orphans . \nHe himself ` adopted ' one of the babies , helping to pay for its support . \nHis concern about political imprisonment and mistreatment was inspired by Arthur Koestler 's Spanish Testament , which described the horrors of imprisonment and threatened execution by the Fascists . \nIt was this concern that led to his next campaign - the plight of Jews who had fled from Hitler 's Germany . \nDespite some opposition , he succeeded in getting his school friends and their families to raise # 4,000 to bring two young German Jews to Britain . \nAfter leaving Eton , he helped his politically committed mother find homes in various countries for refugee children who arrived in London . \nThe Trades Union Congress sent him to Spain as its observer at the trials of trade unionists in the early Fifties . \nHe was appalled by what he saw in the courtrooms and in the prisons . \nIn one instance he was so outraged by the proceedings that he drew up a list of complaints with which he confronted the trial judge over dinner . \nThe trial ended with acquittals , a rarity in fascist Spain . \nBenenson , who had been ill for some time , died on Friday evening at the John Radcliffe Hospital , Oxford . \nLighting a candle in St Martin-in-the Fields church to mark the twentieth anniversary of Amnesty , he said : ' I have lit this candle , in the words of Shakespeare , ` against oblivion ' - so that the forgotten prisoners should always be remembered . \nWe work in Amnesty against oblivion .

January 2005 00.46 GMT It will be one of the biggest parties in American history , but half of the country will be left out . \nWith a price tag of up to $ 50 million , President George W Bush 's inauguration in 11 days ' time will be an unashamed celebration of Red America 's victory over Blue America in last November 's election . \nIt is going to be the most expensive , most security-obsessed event in the history of Washington DC . \nAn army of 10,000 police , secret service officers and FBI agents will patrol the capital for four days of massive celebrations that some critics have derided as reminiscent of the lavish shindigs thrown by Louis XIV , France 's extravagant Sun King . \nMore than 150,000 people , nearly all Republicans whose tickets are a reward for election work , will pack the Mall to hear Bush take his oath of office on 20 January . \nThere will be nine official balls , countless unofficial ones , parades and a concert hosted by Bush 's daughters , Jenna and Barbara . \nAmid the official pageantry will be many huge parties laid on by companies wishing to win favor with Washington 's power players . \nAnyone who is anyone in Republican circles will be in town . \nMany Democrats will be leaving . \nWith so many big names in one place , security measures will include road blocks , anti-aircraft guns guarding the skies and sniper teams patrolling the rooftops . \nMany observers say it is all too much . \n` We have elected a President who seems to have quite a monarchical role . \nIt is a bit of a coronation , ' said Larry Haas , a former official in Bill Clinton 's White House . \nCertainly , Bush 's inauguration will be an orgy of gladhanding and partying by the Republican faithful from all over the country . \nOne Washington hotel , the Mandarin Oriental , is offering visitors four nights in its Presidential Suite for $ 200,000 . \nThe price tag includes a 24-hour butler , a chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce or Humvee , daily champagne and caviar and a flight to the hotel in a private jet . \nOne highlight of the bonanza is the Black Tie and Boots Ball organised by Bush 's home state of Texas , with the President as star guest . \nTen thousand tickets sold out in less than 50 minutes , and are now trading privately at $ 1,300 each . \nAnother is the Commander-in-Chief 's Ball where Bush will honor American soldiers fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan . \nThis is billed as the centrepiece of the inauguration , which itself has a theme tinged with the idea of military service . \nAll the partying is being condemned by many commentators as in poor taste for a nation fighting a bloody war . \nCarroll Wilson , editor of the Texas newspaper the Times Record , has called the cost obscene and ' a horrendous waste ' . \n` There 's something inherently embarrassing about spending $ 50m on a party that will start and end in the blink of a very red eye , ' he added . \nThe fighting in Iraq has provoked calls for the celebrations to be toned down , as they were during the two world wars when some were even canceled . \nBush 's second inauguration will be the first in wartime since President Richard Nixon took office in 1969 during the Vietnam conflict . \nYet the partying is being intensified . \nThe Commander-in-Chief 's Ball is being hailed by organisers as a fitting tribute to American soldiers on active service . \nMore than 2,000 troops and their partners , selected by the Pentagon , will take part . \nMost have served in Iraq or Afghanistan or are about to go there . \nThe parades will have a stronger than normal military theme . \nThat angers many anti-war protesters who say the lavish celebration is inappropriate during conflict . \nSome conservative commentators have even joined the fray , contrasting the spending with a recent scandal over a shortage of armor for American soldiers and their vehicles . \nA huge series of demonstrations is now being planned which organisers say will be much larger than the ones that marked Bush 's first inauguration after the contested Florida recount in 2000 . \n` We want our voices to be heard , ' said a spokesman for the Answer Coalition , which is co-ordinating the protests . \nThe huge security presence means there is likely to be little disruption , especially of the oath-taking ceremony itself . \nMore vulnerable may be the corporate events taking place all over the city . \nThe $ 50m bill is mostly being paid by private donations from people and firms currying political favor . \nWith a strict ban on large single donations to active political campaigns , the inauguration offers a rare chance for companies and individuals to lavish large sums of money on the President and his party simultaneously . \nThe big donors are split into ` underwriters ' , who stumped up $ 250,000 each , and ` sponsors ' , who merely shelled out $ 100,000 . \nBoth gain access to a variety of events that will be attended by Bush . \nThe donors are a familiar roster of Republican supporters and big business . \nThey include firms in the President 's former business , oil , such as Exxon Mobil and ChevronTexaco , former Enron president Richard Kinder and Texas oil baron Boone Pickens , who also gave $ 500,000 to the anti-John Kerry campaign of Swift Boat Veterans for Truth . \nThough the guests will be celebrating Bush 's victory , some Washington insiders will also be keeping a keen eye on the jockeying for position that has already begun for the next election . \n` The clock to 2008 starts ticking the second after Bush finishes his oath , ' Haas said ` At that moment Republicans begin moving into position for that . \nBush should enjoy his moment while he can .

' \nDawn Halfaker was arguably more fortunate than Huff . \nThe 25-year-old Californian is home from Iraq now and has been spending time before attending post-graduate college snowboarding and playing basketball - with one arm . \nShe had already been in firefights and had killed insurgents when she went on a routine reconnaissance patrol with her military police platoon in Baquoba one night last year . \nThey were ambushed and a rocket-propelled grenade screamed into her armored vehicle . \nIt tore off the arm of Sergeant Norberto Lara , sending the limb flying into the driver 's lap , then exploded at Halfaker 's shoulder , blasting her head and arm . \nMedics kept her alive until they reached a base , where her last words before passing out were : ` You bastards better not cut my arm off . ' \nShe woke up an amputee , dreams of becoming a professional basketball player as shattered as her body . \nBut she has no regrets about being a soldier in a modern war zone . \n` Woman in combat is not really an issue . \nIt is happening , ' she said . \nFighting insurgents across Iraq makes for a chaotic battlefield . \n` Everyone pretty much acknowledges there are no rear battle areas , no forward line of troops , ' said Halfaker . \nFour women died under enemy fire in the Gulf war , where female troops made headlines flying combat aircraft , driving supply trucks close to the front lines and being taken as prisoners of war . \nEight servicewomen died during the Vietnam war - all nurses - and hundreds have died in previous conflicts , but as auxiliary troops or medics serving far to the rear , succumbing most often to disease and accidents . \nIn 1994 Bill Clinton opened up 90 per cent of military jobs to women . \nBut although that meant they could officially go into combat by air and by sea , they were and still are barred from units that go on the offensive on land , including the general infantry , the marines and the special forces , and from units that accompany those troops . \nArmy documents have now surfaced , however , recommending a lifting of the ban on women in units serving alongside other units that primarily go into combat . \nOfficials say it is no more than a discussion document at this stage , others say it is the first step towards sanctioning women in land combat . \n` The government will probably not deal with this until the Iraq conflict is over , otherwise , if it went the wrong way , they could face having to pull the women out of Iraq who are there now , who are de facto in combat , ' said Lory Manning , a retired navy captain and director of the Centre For Women in Uniform in Washington DC . \nWomen are firing missiles from helicopters , but are not yet going on the offensive on the ground in Iraq , Manning said . \nBut they are returning fire in ways never seen before . \nParatrooper Kellie McCoy of St Louis , Missouri , has just returned to Iraq after a break following her award of a bronze star with a rare ` V ' for valor . \nMcCoy , 29 , was only on her third day in Iraq last September when her convoy ran into an ambush during the attack on Falluja . \nShe cranked out machine-gun rounds until she had killed enough of the enemy to break through and escape , rescuing others on the way . \n` Captain McCoy willingly and repeatedly took action to gather up her soldiers under enemy fire and direct fire at the enemy , ' her citation stated . \n` Her actions inspired her men to accomplish the mission and saved the lives of her fellow soldiers . ' \nSuch tributes , and they are few but not isolated , rebuff the myth that men ca n't go to war with women because sexual tensions or their urge to protect them will sink morale . \nAnd the argument that the public would not stand for news of servicewomen coming home in coffins has not been borne out . \nWomen are being awarded bronze stars and record numbers are receiving the booby prize of the wounded , the Purple Heart . \nOne such is Major Ladda Duckworth , the most severely wounded of five female amputees in rehab at Walter Reed Army Hospital . \nThe Black Hawk pilot lost both legs and a huge chunk of one arm when her helicopter was shot down . \nStaff were shocked when she was brought in . ' \nI think they had not seen a female that badly mutilated , ' said 37-year-old Duckworth , from Illinois . \nNow all she wants is to fly again and says she joined the ranks because ' I wanted to take the same risks as the guys . ' \nBut Elaine Donnelly , president of the Centre for Military Readiness in Washington , still argues that : ` The concept of equality does not fit in combat environments . \nThe nation has got used to the idea of women dying in combat , and I do n't think that 's a good thing . ' \nManning points out that no one wants to see combat casualties of either gender and says none of the deaths in Iraq is justified - because the war itself is not . \n` But if you are going to fight wars , women have to be there , and they have shown how tough they can be when they need to be , ' she added . \n"}

'' \nMost of the relatives will attend today 's service , with some traveling from as far afield as New Zealand , Australia and Bangladesh . \nConducted by the Dean of St Paul 's , the Very Reverend John Moses and attended by Mr Blair , the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh , the 55-minute service is designed to reflect the religious and cultural diversity of London and those who died or were injured . \nOf the 52 people who were killed , 36 were British citizens and families of the other 16 , who came from countries as diverse as Mauritania , Ireland , Italy , Nigeria , Grenada , Poland , France , New Zealand , Ghana and Bangladesh , have flown into London to be at the service today . \nIn an opening bidding , the dean will speak of the resolve of countless men and women of different faiths and cultures to live together in peace . \nFour candles , representing each of the locations where the suicide bombers struck - Aldgate , Edgware Road , King 's Cross and Tavistock Square - will form the focal point of the service as they are carried to the Dome altar by emergency and transport staff . \nThey will be followed by bereaved families of individuals who died in the three tube attacks and the bomb on the No 30 bus . \nThe driver of the bus , George Psaradakis , had been due to carry the Tavistock Square candle but he is suffering severe post-traumatic stress and understood to be too ill to attend . \nAfter meetings with the culture secretary , Tessa Jowell , last week several families were asked if they would like to meet the Queen following the service . \nIt was an invitation which divided one family . \nLouise Gray , whose husband Richard , 41 , was killed in the Aldgate blast , told the London Evening Standard that her son Adam , 11 , was refusing to go to the service but his sister , Ruby , seven , would be presenting a posy to the Queen . \nMrs Gray said Adam blamed Mr Blair for making London vulnerable to the terrorist attack which killed his father as he traveled to work from his home in Ipswich . \n`` He -LRB- Adam -RRB- is very angry . \nHe fully understands what happened . \nHe is very angry with the bombers but he also blames the war and he blames the government . \nHe does n't want to be part of anything that has Tony Blair there . '' \nBut she said Ruby decided to come after being asked by the organisers to present a posy to the Queen . \nOther families who will meet the Queen include Graham and Janet Foulkes , the parents of David Foulkes , 22 , a Guardian employee and one of the youngest to die in the bombings . \n-LRB- The service begins at 3pm -RRB- Processional hymn Praise to the Lord , the Almighty , the King of Creation The bidding given by the Dean of St Paul 's , Dr John Moses , followed by The Lord 's Prayer Anthem O Vos Omnes qui Transitis per viam -LRB- All ye that pass by behold -RRB- Reading Isaiah 51.1-6 , read by Ken Livingstone , the mayor of London Hymn Judge Eternal , Throned in Splendour Sermon given by the Archbishop of Canterbury , Dr Rowan Williams Hymn Father Hear The Prayer We Offer In remembrance and thanksgiving led by Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor , Archbishop of Westminster , and the Rev Esme Beswick , co-president of Churches Together in England Kyrie Eleison by Maurice Durufl , sung by the choir . \n"}

'' \nLater on the tour , Mr Bush was asked if the US could continue spending billions of dollars in the war in Iraq amid the hurricane crisis . \nHe replied : `` We 've got plenty of resources to do both . \nWe 'll secure our country from the terrorists and we 'll rebuild this area . \nWe 've got what it takes to do more than one thing . '' \nBut even as the rescue operation continues , anger is growing that the administration 's focus on the war in Iraq diminished its ability to respond adequately to a growing crisis at home . \n`` There 's no doubt it has already led people to further question the president 's involvement in Iraq , '' said William Stewart , professor emeritus of political science at the University of Alabama . \n`` If we did n't have so many resources there , we might have been able to respond to the tragedy here at home more quickly . '' \nPublic dissent over Mr Bush 's reaction is reflected in newspaper editorials , radio talk shows and weblogs . \nThe New York Times described the president 's first public comments on the tragedy on Wednesday , two days after the storm hit , as `` one of the worst speeches of his career '' . \nIts columnist Paul Krugman wrote : `` America , once famous for its can-do attitude , now has a ca n't - do government that makes excuses instead of doing its job . \nAnd while it makes those excuses , Americans are dying . '' \nAmanda Lang , a retired US army officer and political commentator writing on the Opednews.com weblog , attacked the president for staying on vacation at his Crawford ranch for three days before returning to Washington . \n`` He treats his own citizens with the same contempt and callousness as he does the Iraqi civilians , as ` collateral damage ' , '' Professor Lang said . \nReferring to Mr Bush 's address to citizens of the Gulf coast , she added : `` His heart and prayers may have been there , but his ass sure was n't . '' \nThose directly involved in the tragedy have also spoken out . \nRay Nagin , the New Orleans mayor , reflected the anger of his stranded citizens when he told a local radio station : `` We had an incredible crisis here and his flying over in Air Force One does not do it justice . \nThey flew down here one time two days after the doggone event was over with TV cameras , AP reporters , all kind of goddamn - excuse my French , everybody in America , but I am pissed -LRB- off -RRB- . '' \nProf Stewart said Mr Bush 's early handling of the situation was definitely `` not a plus '' but that he was always going to receive criticism regardless of his actions . \n`` It is easy to say in retrospect that he should have done such and such but , because of the scale of the problems , any administration would have been underprepared . '' \nPolitical enemies wasted little time in weighing in . \nPresident Hugo Chvez of Venezuela , a long-time critic who refers to Mr Bush as Mr Danger , said : `` That man , the king of vacations , said nothing but ` you have to flee ' , and did not say how . \nIt 's cowboy mentality . '' \nWith a war in the Middle East , economic difficulties at home , including soaring petrol prices , and now the nation 's largest natural disaster to deal with , Mr Bush is facing his biggest challenge since the 2001 terrorist attacks . \n`` This is a supreme test of Bush 's leadership at a time when resources are thin and his approval ratings are perilously low , '' poll expert John Zogby told Reuters . \n`` The president is going to have to do a lot more than a 25-minute flyover .

{"id": "87", "time": "2005-11-08", "text": "The media are minimizing US and British war crimes in Iraq The reporting of the Iraqi death toll - both in its scale and account of who is doing the killing - is profoundly dishonest We were told that the Iraqis do n't count . \nBefore the invasion began , the head of US central command , General Thomas Franks , boasted that `` we do n't do body counts '' . \nHis claim was repeated by Donald Rumsfeld in November 2003 -LRB- `` We do n't do body counts on other people '' -RRB- and the Pentagon last January -LRB- `` The only thing we keep track of is casualties for US troops and civilians '' -RRB- . \nBut it 's not true . \nAlmost every week the Pentagon claims to have killed 50 or 70 or 100 insurgents in its latest assault on the latest stronghold of the ubiquitous monster Zarqawi . \nIn May the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff said that his soldiers had killed 250 of Zarqawi 's `` closest lieutenants '' -LRB- or so 500 of his best friends had told him -RRB- . \nBut last week , the Pentagon did something new . \nBuried in its latest security report to Congress is a bar chart labeled `` average daily casualties - Iraqi and coalition . \n1 Jan 04-16 Sep 05 '' . \nThe claim that it kept no track of Iraqi deaths was false . \nThe report does not explain what it means by casualty , or if its figures represent all casualties , only insurgents , or , as the foregoing paragraph appears to hint , only civilians killed by insurgents . \nThere is no explanation of how the figures were gathered or compiled . \nThe only accompanying text consists of the words `` Source : MNC-I '' , which means Multi-National Corps - Iraq . \nWe 'll just have to trust them . \nWhat the chart shows is that these unexplained casualties have more than doubled since the beginning of the Pentagon 's survey . \nFrom January to March 2004 , 26 units of something or other were happening every day , while in September 2005 the something or other rose to 64 . \nBut whatever it is that 's been rising , the weird morality of this war dictates that it is reported as good news . \nJournalists have been multiplying the daily average of mystery units by the number of days , discovering that the figure is lower than previous estimates of Iraqi deaths , and using it to cast doubts on them . \nAs ever , the study in the line of fire is the report published by the Lancet in October last year . \nIt was a household survey - of 988 homes in 33 randomly selected districts - and it suggested , on the basis of the mortality those households reported before and after the invasion , that the risk of death in Iraq had risen by a factor of 1.5 ; somewhere between 8,000 and 194,000 extra people had died , with the most probable figure being 98,000 . \nAround half the deaths , if Falluja was included , or 15 % if it was not , were caused by violence , and the majority of those by attacks on the part of US forces . \nIn the US and the UK , the study was either ignored or torn to bits . \nThe media described it as `` inflated '' , `` overstated '' , `` politicised '' and `` out of proportion '' . \nJust about every possible misunderstanding and distortion of its statistics was published , of which the most remarkable was the Observer 's claim that : `` The report 's authors admit it drew heavily on the rebel stronghold of Falluja , which has been plagued by fierce fighting . \nStrip out Falluja , as the study itself acknowledged , and the mortality rate is reduced dramatically . '' \nIn fact , as they made clear on page one , the authors had stripped out Falluja ; their estimate of 98,000 deaths would otherwise have been much higher . \nBut the attacks in the press succeeded in sinking the study . \nNow , whenever a newspaper or broadcaster produces an estimate of civilian deaths , the Lancet report is passed over in favor of lesser figures . \nFor the past three months , the editors and subscribers of the website Medialens have been writing to papers and broadcasters to try to find out why . \nThe standard response , exemplified by a letter from the BBC 's online news service last week , is that the study 's `` technique of sampling and extrapolating from samples has been criticised '' . \nThat 's true , and by the same reasoning we could dismiss the fact that 6 million people were killed in the Holocaust , on the grounds that this figure has also been criticised , albeit by skinheads . \nThe issue is not whether the study has been criticised , but whether the criticism is valid . \nAs Medialens has pointed out , it was the same lead author , using the same techniques , who reported that 1.7 million people had died as a result of conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo -LRB- DRC -RRB- . \nThat finding has been cited by Tony Blair , Colin Powell and almost every major newspaper on both sides of the Atlantic , and none has challenged either the method or the result . \nUsing the Congo study as justification , the UN security council called for all foreign armies to leave the DRC and doubled the country 's UN aid budget . \nThe other reason the press gives for burying the Lancet study is that it is out of line with competing estimates . \nLike Jack Straw , wriggling his way around the figures in a written ministerial statement , they compare it to the statistics compiled by the Iraqi health ministry and the website Iraq Body Count . \nIn December 2003 , Associated Press reported that `` Iraq 's health ministry has ordered a halt to a count of civilians killed during the war '' . \nAccording to the head of the ministry 's statistics department , both the puppet government and the Coalition Provisional Authority demanded that it be stopped . \nAs Naomi Klein has shown on these pages , when US soldiers stormed Falluja -LRB- a year ago today -RRB- , their first action was to seize the general hospital and arrest the doctors . \nThe New York Times reported that `` the hospital was selected as an early target because the American military believed that it was the source of rumors about heavy casualties '' . \nAfter the coalition had used these novel statistical methods to improve the results , Blair told parliament that `` figures from the Iraqi ministry of health , which are a survey from the hospitals there , are in our view the most accurate survey there is '' . \nIraq Body Count , whose tally has reached 26,000-30 ,000 , measures only civilian deaths which can be unambiguously attributed to the invasion and which have been reported by two independent news agencies . \nAs the compilers point out , `` it is likely that many if not most civilian casualties will go unreported by the media ... our own total is certain to be an underestimate of the true position , because of gaps in reporting or recording '' . \nOf the seven mortality reports surveyed by the Overseas Development Institute , the estimate in the Lancet 's paper was only the third highest . \nIt remains the most thorough study published so far . \nExtraordinary as its numbers seem , they are the most likely to be true . \nAnd what of the idea that most of the violent deaths in Iraq are caused by coalition troops ? \nWell according to the Houston Chronicle , even Blair 's favorite data source , the Iraqi health ministry , reports that twice as many Iraqis - and most of them civilians - are being killed by US and UK forces as by insurgents . \nWhen the Pentagon claims that it has just killed 50 or 70 or 100 rebel fighters , we have no means of knowing who those people really were . \nEveryone it blows to pieces becomes a terrorist . \nIn July Jack Keane , the former vice chief of staff of the US army , claimed that coalition troops had killed or captured more than 50,000 `` insurgents '' since the start of the rebellion . \nPerhaps they were all Zarqawi 's closest lieutenants . \nWe can expect the US and UK governments to seek to minimize the extent of their war crimes . \nBut it 's time the media stopped collaborating . \n"}
{"id": "290", "time": "2005-11-30", "text": "Vice-president accused of backing torture Claims on BBC by former insider add to Bush 's woes Vice-president Dick Cheney 's burden on the Bush administration grew heavier yesterday after a former senior US state department official said he could be guilty of a war crime over the abuse of prisoners . \nLawrence Wilkerson , who served as chief of staff to secretary of state Colin Powell from 2002 to 2005 , singled out Mr Cheney in a wide-ranging political assault on the BBC 's Today program . \nMr Wilkerson said that in an internal administration debate over whether to abide by the Geneva conventions in the treatment of detainees , Mr Cheney led the argument `` that essentially wanted to do away with all restrictions '' . \nAsked whether the vice-president was guilty of a war crime , Mr Wilkerson replied : `` Well , that 's an interesting question - it was certainly a domestic crime to advocate terror and I would suspect that it is ... an international crime as well . '' \nIn the context of other remarks it appeared he was using the word `` terror '' to apply to the systematic abuse of prisoners . \nThe Washington Post last month called Mr Cheney the `` vice-president for torture '' for his demand that the CIA be exempted from a ban on `` cruel , inhuman and degrading '' treatment of detainees . \nMr Wilkerson , a former army colonel , also said he had seen increasing evidence that the White House had manipulated pre-war intelligence on Iraq to make its case for the invasion . \nHe said : `` You begin to wonder was this intelligence spun ? \nDid , in fact , the American people get fooled ? \nI am beginning to have my concerns . '' \nMr Cheney has been under fire for his role in assembling evidence of weapons of mass destruction . \nMr Wilkerson told the Associated Press that the vice-president must have sincerely believed Iraq could be a spawning ground for terrorism because `` otherwise I have to declare him a moron , an idiot or a nefarious bastard '' . \nSuch charges have kept the Bush administration on the defensive for several months . \nMr Bush yesterday repeated his earlier assertion that the US `` does not torture and that 's important for people around the world to realize '' . \nHe is also due to make the first of a series of speeches today , outlining his plan to defeat the insurgency and pave the way for US withdrawal . \nThe White House will also publish a declassified version of its war plan . \nBut it has now emerged that two justice department memos listing permissible interrogation methods have been kept secret by the White House , even from the Senate intelligence committee . \nThe New Yorker recently quoted a source who had seen a memo as calling it `` breathtaking '' . \n`` The document dismissed virtually all national and international laws regulating the treatment of prisoners , including war crimes and assault statutes , and it was radical in its view that in wartime the president can fight enemies by whatever means he sees fit , '' the magazine reported . \nOne technique allegedly used by the CIA in questioning suspects is `` waterboarding '' -LRB- strapping a detainee to a board and submerging it until the prisoner believes he or she is drowning -RRB- . \nThe White House is accused of defining `` torture '' so narrowly as to exclude such methods . \nBut James Ross , a legal expert at Human Rights Watch said such a narrow definition was at odds with international norms . \n`` Waterboarding is clearly a form of torture . \nIt has been used since the Inquisition . \nIt was a well-known torture technique in Latin America , '' Mr Ross said . \nHuman Rights Watch this year called for a special counsel to investigate any US officials - no matter their rank or position - who took part in , `` ordered , or had command responsibility for war crimes or torture , or other prohibited ill-treatment against detainees in US custody '' . \nThe report focused on the defense secretary , Donald Rumsfeld , for his alleged command responsibility for abuses at Abu Ghraib , but Mr Wilkerson argued Mr Cheney was ultimately responsible . \nThe US is a signatory to the 1984 UN Convention Against Torture , which bans inflicting `` severe pain or suffering , whether physical or mental '' . \nSuch practices are also a crime under US federal law . \n"}
{"id": "298", "time": "2005-12-17", "text": "The war in Iraq has had at least one redeeming feature . \nAlong with events in Afghanistan , it has revived serious debate into some of the most important and long-standing issues in history and politics . \nType the four words `` Iraq '' , `` Afghanistan '' , `` America '' and `` empire '' into Google , for instance , and you get around 3.5 million hits . \nThere are the usual mad bloggers and propaganda rants but there is also a wealth of discussion on offer that expands every day . \nIs the US an empire ? \nIf so , what sort of empire ? \nIs imperialism good or bad , or sometimes both ? \nAnd , of course : why has it proved so hard for America , the most formidable military and economic power the world has seen , to effect its will ? \nThe passion behind this on-screen questioning is evident . \nSo , very often , is a limited understanding of what imperial ventures have usually involved . \nIn part , this is understandable . \nBefore 1939 most of the world was still ruled by empires of some kind , as had been the case for much of recorded history . \nSince the second world war and decolonisation , however , most people have drawn their impressions of empire as a mode of rule less from direct experience than from one of two powerful mythologies . \nSome still veer towards the old , conservative mythology of maps drenched in pink and brave pith-helmeted sahibs doing selfless , transforming work for `` native '' peoples . \nBut this view has increasingly retreated before a rival , post-colonial mythology . \nAccording to this , empires -LRB- especially European ones -RRB- always rested overwhelmingly on force and invariably provoked desperate resistance that ultimately painfully triumphed . \nClearly antagonistic , these two selective visions none the less have something in common . \nThey both make empires out to have been more powerful than historically was often the case . \nSome variants and examples of empire have proved powerful and durable . \nChina , for example , is essentially a land-based empire , forged over the centuries by conquest and migration , which has managed to reposition itself as a nation state . \nAnd the kind of `` informal empire '' that Britain ran in parts of the world in the 19th century is also very much with us today . \nThe US has no conventional colonies and may be in trouble in Iraq . \nBut it retains military and naval bases in some 130 countries , and consequently the potential for influence over and intervention in them ; and it possesses - as every mighty empire has done - a network of supportive and tractable client states , including , arguably , Britain . \nDirect overseas empire , however , has tended to be more uncertain and more vulnerable . \nAs the political scientist Stephen Walt has written , in words that should be inscribed in gold in the Oval Office and at 10 Downing Street , it is `` extremely difficult to project power across water and on to a foreign shore '' . \nThe histories of the old European empires demonstrate this clearly enough . \nEven at the height of their imperial power , there were countries - such as Afghanistan - where the British were never able to establish themselves successfully ; and others - such as Egypt - where their rule was only tenuous . \nAs for India , the jewel in Victoria 's Crown Imperial , the British only held on to it for as long as they did by way of an army and police force that were overwhelmingly made up of Indians , and by collaborating with Indian princes who continued to rule a third of the subcontinent . \nBut the most difficult form of empire by far to carry off successfully - and this is where imperial history becomes acutely relevant - has been the well-meaning , transformative variant . \nNeocon politicians and intellectuals who are willing to admit to the existence of a US empire , such as Dinesh D'Souza , often argue that American interventionism is better and purer than old-style , Old World imperialisms , because to a unique degree it strives to make the world a better place . \nYet such American idealism - which is real enough - represents one of the ways in which present-day foreign policy closely mirrors imperial ventures in the past . \nAncient Rome , Qing China , Napoleonic France and conspicuously imperial Britain did not simply invade and occupy other people 's lands out of economic greed . \nIn each case , empire was also driven at times by the desire to spread improvement , and to export cultural and political practices that were seen as better , fairer and more civilised . \nViewed this way , George Bush 's desire to implant US-style democracy in the Middle East , along with greater religious freedoms , women 's rights and the rule of law - by force of arms if necessary - is profoundly reminiscent of past British imperial practices , which may be one reason why Tony Blair and the new Tory leader have supported the project so enthusiastically . \nIn the 19th and early 20th centuries , British imperialists too frequently sought to deploy their power to export representative government , the rule of law , women 's education and the abolition of slavery , and sometimes even secured a measure of success . \nThis week 's elections keep open the prospect that Iraq might also ultimately be regarded as a success . \nBut there is an obvious difficulty involved in this kind of aspirational imperialism . \nIt is hard to convince people that you mean them well if you are looking at them down the barrel of a gun . \nMoreover , imperial idealism frequently loses out to the practicalities of rule . \nInstead of exporting what they perceived to be rational , modern , humane government to their colonies , the British often found themselves propping up deeply unattractive and corrupt princelings and client rulers because this was the cheapest way of maintaining control . \nIt remains to be seen how far , and how durably , the US will achieve anything better in Iraq . \nThe gulf between imperial ideals and empire on the ground has customarily proved disillusioning not only for colonial peoples but also for some in the occupying power . \nIn the past , anti-imperialists in Britain , such as Richard Cobden or George Orwell , regularly argued that overseas adventurism was detracting from the nation 's decency and liberty . \nBritish anti-imperialists also argued , exactly like the author and journalist Chalmers Johnson is doing now in the US , that heavy expenditure on an overseas presence and military action abroad undermined the economic wellbeing of ordinary working people at home . \nBut , while current events have revived awareness that seeking to remodel other countries can be a difficult and chancey business even for the invaders , there is one respect in which this has come to be true in the present to a degree that never applied in the past . \nAdam Smith , who distrusted empire , argued that only when `` all the different quarters of the world '' were able to inspire `` mutual fear '' would nations finally begin to respect the integrity of each other 's borders . \nIn the most horrible of ways , al-Qaida is after a fashion testing this very premise . \nIn the past , the imperialism of the west , like that of the rest , was often difficult - for the doers as well as for their victims ;

'' \nFor the American imperial strategists invested deeply in the belief that through spreading terror they could take power . \nNeoconservatives such as Paul Wolfowitz , Richard Perle and the recently indicted Lewis `` Scooter '' Libby , learned from Leo Strauss that a strong and wise minority of humans had to rule over the weak majority through deception and fear , rather than persuasion or compromise . \nThey read Le Bon and Freud on the relationship of crowds to authority . \nBut most of all they loved Hobbes 's Leviathan . \nWhile Hobbes saw authority as free men 's chosen solution to the imperfections of anarchy , his 21st century heirs seek to create the fear that led to submission . \nAnd technology would make it possible and beautiful . \nOn the logo of the Pentagon 's Information Awareness Office , the motto is Scientia est potentia - knowledge is power . \nThe IAO promised `` total information awareness '' , an all-seeing eye spilling out a death-ray gaze over Eurasia . \nCongressional pressure led the IAO to close , but technospeak , half-digested political theory and megalomania still riddle US thinking . \nBarnett , in The Pentagon 's New Map and Blueprint for Action , calls for a `` systems administrator '' force to be dispatched with the military , to `` process '' conquered countries . \nThe G8 and a few others are the `` Kantian core '' , writes Barnett , warming over the former Blair adviser Robert Cooper 's poisonous guff from 2002 ; their job is to export their economy and politics by force to the unlucky `` Hobbesian gap '' . \nImperialism is imagined as an industrial technique to remake societies and cultures , with technology giving sanction to those who intervene . \nThe Afghanistan war of 2001 taught the wrong lessons . \nThe US assumed this was the model of how a small , special forces-dominated campaign , using local proxies and calling in gunships or airstrikes , would sweep away opposition . \nBut all Afghanistan showed was how an outside power could intervene in a finely balanced civil war . \nThe one-eyed Mullah Omar 's great escape on his motorbike was a warning that the God 's - eye view can miss the human detail . \nThe problem for the US today is that Leviathan has shot his wad . \nIraq revealed the hubris of the imperial geostrategy . \nOne small nation can tie down a superpower . \nAir and space supremacy do not give command on the ground . \nPeople ca n't be terrorised into identification with America . \nThe US has proved able to destroy massively - but not create , or even control . \nAfghanistan and Iraq lie in ruins , yet the occupiers cower behind concrete mountains . \nThe spin machine is on full tilt to represent Iraq as a success . \nPeters , in New Glory : Expanding America 's Supremacy , asserts : `` Our country is a force for good without precedent '' ; and Barnett , in Blueprint , says : `` The US military is a force for global good that ... has no equal . '' \nBoth offer ambitious plans for how the US is going to remake the third world in its image . \nThere is a violent hysteria to the boasts . \nThe narcissism of a decade earlier has given way to an extrovert rage at those who have resisted America 's will since 2001 . \nBoth urge utter ruthlessness in crushing resistance . \nIn November 2004 , Peters told Fox News that in Falluja `` the best outcome , frankly , is if they 're all killed '' . \nBut he directs his real fury at France and Germany : `` A haggard Circe , Europe dulled our senses and fooled us into believing in her attractions . \nBut the dugs are dry in Germany and France . \nThey deluded us into prolonging the affair long after our attentions should have turned to ... India , South Africa , Brazil . '' \nWhile a good Kleinian therapist may be able to help Peters work through his weaning trauma , only America can cure its post 9\\/11 mixture of paranoia and megalomania . \nBut Britain - and other allied states - can help . \nThe US needs to discover , like a child that does not know its limits , that there is a world outside its body and desires , beyond even the reach of its toys , that suffers too . \nDr Richard Drayton , a senior lecturer in history at Cambridge University , is the author of Nature 's Government , a study of science , technology and imperialism Letters for publication should be sent to : letters@guardian.co.uk If you need help using the site : userhelp@guardian.co.uk Call the main Guardian and Observer switchboard : Richard Drayton : Shock , awe and Hobbes have backfired on America 's neocons This article appeared on p26 of the Main section section of the Guardian on 00.03 GMT on Wednesday 28 December 2005 . \nAfter reports that unarmed drones might be deployed to search for self-proclaimed killer Christopher Dorner near Los Angeles , should law enforcement agencies use armed drones against an ` imminent threat ' on US soil ? \n"}
{"id": "310", "time": "2005-02-28", "text": "Monday 28 February 2005 00.53 GMT Who would have thought that 13 pages of paper would so come to haunt Tony Blair ? \nYet the full version of the opinion drawn up by the attorney general , Lord Goldsmith , about the legality of a military attack on Iraq will , I suspect , come to rank in recent British history only with the protocol enshrining the Anglo-French-Israeli collusion before the invasion of Suez in 1956 . \nSir Anthony Eden instructed his cabinet secretary to burn the British copy of that protocol . \nTony Blair has long been irritated by what he sees as a malign British obsession with procedure rather than results . \nIn the past he has publicly dismissed such debate about the nuances and due processes of government as a kind of anorakry . \nHere he is in the House of Commons in July 2000 on the significance of the ministerial code , formerly known as questions of procedure for ministers : `` No one will be better governed through finetuning the ministerial code . \nThose are good issues for academics and constitutional experts , but they are not the big issues that parliament should debate when we consider our role in modern society . '' \nThe Butler report placed such matters as proper procedure right at the heart of Blair 's prime ministerial `` role in the modern society '' . \nOn July 20 2004 , six days after Butler was published , Blair was on his feet in the Commons undertaking to implement its procedural recommendations . \nThe constitutional anorak suddenly fitted the prime ministerial shoulders . \n`` Prior to the war , '' he said , `` meetings were held with an informal group , including the foreign and defense secretaries , the chief of the defense staff , the head of the Secret Intelligence Service , the chairman of the JIC , and my foreign policy adviser . \nIn any future situation , such a group , which brought together the key players required to work on operational military planning and developing the diplomatic strategy , will operate formally as an ad hoc cabinet committee . '' \nIn his report , Lord Butler showed that the government 's fundamental shift in the spring of 2002 from a policy of containing Saddam Hussein to one designed `` to enforce disarmament '' was not based on any new development in the current intelligence picture on Iraq . \nSimilarly , in the run-up to the war , Goldsmith -LRB- who eventually judged it legal without a further , specific UN resolution authorising the use of force -RRB- warned his ministerial colleagues that `` there would be no justification for the use of force against Iraq on grounds of self-defence against an imminent threat '' . \nOne of the impressive aspects of the Butler report was the way his committee followed the intelligence trail into the attorney general 's office and assessed the degree to which it did or did not shape his advice to the prime minister 's group on Iraq and to the cabinet . \nThe attorney general 's legal opinion has not been published in full . \nAll parliament has been given is a written answer from Goldsmith , with an accompanying summary prepared by the Foreign Office , dated March 17 2003 . \nThe Butler committee has seen the opinion in full . \nWhat we did not know until Butler appeared before the select committee on October 21 2004 was that initially the government had been unwilling to show it to Butler 's committee of privy counsellors . \nAs Butler put it : `` There were moments when we had a bit of tension with the government about whether they were going to disclose documents to us . \nOne of the examples of that was the attorney general 's legal opinion . \nHad we gone public and said , ` We think this is relevant to our committee and the government will not give use access to it , ' we would have had huge public and media support . \nThat was an important leverage on the government . '' \nButler 's revelation was striking in itself . \nBut it also suggested that Goldsmith 's opinion , which led to the resignation of Elizabeth Wilmshurst , the FO 's foremost expert on the legality of military operations , was even more finely balanced than we had thought . \nMissing from the Butler report is the information that it was not ministers who requested that final legal opinion from Goldsmith . \nIt was the senior military and top civil servants in the Ministry of Defense who did so . \nCan the full cabinet really have tested Goldsmith 's opinion when , as Butler reported , the attorney general set out his view on the legal position to the cabinet on March 17 2003 , by producing and speaking to the written answer he gave to parliament on that date ? \nFor me , this and the other accumulations of failures to scrutinise and question in the privacy of the cabinet room amounts to a dereliction of cabinet government comparable only to 1956 . \nThen Eden 's cabinet did not press him at the height of the Suez crisis on the significance of his telling them that `` from secret conversations which had been held in Paris with representatives of the Israeli government , it now appeared that the Israelis would not alone launch a full-scale attack against Egypt '' . \nFrom these remains you did not need a background in British intelligence to sniff out the collusion between the UK , France and Israel , which Eden subsequently flatly denied in the Commons . \nFor me , Goldsmith 's March 2003 opinion on the legality of the Iraq war remains the fault-line under the Blair government . \nLike the permanent stain of Suez on Eden 's reputation , it will not be eradicated from the memory of the Blair premierships for generations to come . \nThe ultimate systems failure in both instances occurred at proper , formal cabinet meetings . \nIf the full cabinet will not take on a dominant prime minister in full cry , there is no other part of the system of government that can compensate for such supineness . \nThe Commons , even if it is permitted a specific vote on peace and war -LRB- as it was in 2003 -RRB- , is not going to possess a range and detail of knowledge comparable to that of ministers . \nIn the Commons last July , Blair promised to tighten up his procedures if , heaven forbid , he should contemplate leading his country into another war of pre-emption . \nIt was a welcome recognition that Butler 's concerns were justified . \nBut can it make any difference if cabinet ministers will not , in a phrase beloved of Roy Jenkins , `` rise to the level of events '' ? \nWith a few big exceptions in the cabinet room , such as Gordon Brown and John Prescott , power and place come courtesy of Blair alone . \n`` Tony wants '' usually means that `` Tony gets '' . \nWill the Butler report really change those ingrained habits on the part of the dispenser and the receivers of patronage ? \nOnly , I suspect , if the engines of war are cranked up once more . \nPeter Hennessy is Attlee professor of contemporary British history , Queen Mary , London . \nThis is an edited version of an article in the current issue of the Political Quarterly www.blackwellpublishing.com Letters for publication should be sent to : letters@guardian.co.uk If you need help using the site : userhelp@guardian.co.uk Call the main Guardian and Observer switchboard : Peter Hennessy : The blame for the Iraq war lies with our supine cabinet This article was published on guardian . \n"}

Promptly at 2am , the electricity went off and I was plunged into the pitch black hell better known as `` an August night with no electricity in Iraq '' . \nSo I sat there , in the dark , trying to remember where I had left the candle and matches . \nAfter five minutes of chagrined meditation , I decided I would `` feel '' my way up the stairs and out on to the roof . \nStep by hesitant step , I stumbled out into the corridor and up the stairs , stubbing a toe on the last step -LRB- which was n't supposed to be there -RRB- . \nI stood there trying to determine whether it was only our area , or the whole city , that had sunk into darkness . \nA few moments later , my younger brother -LRB- we 'll call him E -RRB- joined me - dishevelled , disgruntled and half asleep . \nWe stood leaning on the low wall enclosing the roof watching the street below . \nI could see the tip of Abu Maan 's cigarette glowing in the yard next door . \nI pointed to it with the words , `` Abu Maan ca n't sleep , either ... '' E grunted , `` It 's probably Maan . '' \nI stood staring at him like he was half-wild - or maybe talking in his sleep . \nMaan is only 13 ... how can he be smoking ? \n`` He 's only 13 . '' \n`` Is anyone only 13 any more ? '' \nI mulled this remark over . \nNo , no one is 13 any more . \nNo one is 24 any more ... everyone is 85 and I think I might be 105 . \nI was too tired to speak and , in spite of his open eyes , I suspected E was asleep . \nThe silence was shattered a few moments later by the sound of bullets in the distance . \nIt was just loud enough to get your attention , but too far away to be the source of any real anxiety . \nE : How far do you think that is ? \nMe : I do n't know ... ` bout a kilometre ? \nE -LRB- impressed -RRB- : You 're getting good at this . \nNo - I 'm getting great at it . \nI can tell you if it 's `` them '' or `` us '' . \nI can tell you how far away it is . \nI can tell you if it 's a pistol or machine gun , tank or armored vehicle , Apache or Chinook ... I can determine the distance and maybe even the target . \nThat 's my new talent . \nIt 's something I 've gotten so good at , I frighten myself . \nWhat 's worse is that almost everyone seems to have acquired this new talent ... young and old . \nAnd it 's not something that anyone will appreciate on a resum ... Females can no longer leave their homes alone . \nEach time I go out , E and either a father , uncle , or cousin has to accompany me . \nIt feels like we 've gone back 50 years since the beginning of the occupation . \nA woman , or girl , out alone , is at risk . \nAn outing has to be arranged at least an hour beforehand . \nI state that I need to buy something or have to visit someone . \nTwo males have to be procured -LRB- preferably large -RRB- and `` safety arrangements '' must be made in this total state of lawlessness . \nAnd always the question : `` But do you have to go out and buy it ? \nCa n't I get it for you ? '' \nNo you ca n't , because the kilo of eggplant I absolutely have to select with my own hands is just an excuse to see the light of day and walk down a street . \nThe situation is incredibly frustrating to females who work or go to college . \nBefore the war , around 50 % of the college students were females , and over 50 % of the working force was composed of women . \nNot so any more . \nWe are seeing an increase of fundamentalism in Iraq which is terrifying . \nFor example , before the war , I would estimate -LRB- roughly -RRB- that about 55 % of females in Baghdad wore a hijab - or headscarf . \nHijabs do not signify fundamentalism . \nThat is far from the case - although I myself do n't wear one , I have family and friends who do . \nThe point is that , before , it did n't really matter . \nIt was `` my '' business whether I wore one or not - not the business of some fundamentalist on the street . \nI am female and Muslim . \nBefore the occupation , I more or less dressed the way I wanted to . \nI lived in jeans and cotton pants and comfortable shirts . \nNow , I do n't dare leave the house in pants . \nA long skirt and loose shirt -LRB- preferably with long sleeves -RRB- has become necessary . \nA girl wearing jeans risks being attacked , abducted , or insulted by fundamentalists who have been ... liberated ! \nFathers and mothers are keeping their daughters stashed safe at home . \nThat 's why you see so few females in the streets -LRB- especially after 4pm -RRB- . \nOthers are making their daughters , wives and sisters wear a hijab . \nNot to oppress them , but to protect them . \nI lost my job for a similar reason . \nGirls are being made to quit college and school . \nMy 14-year-old cousin -LRB- a straight-A student -RRB- is going to have to repeat the year because her parents decided to keep her home since the occupation . \nBecause the Supreme Council of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq took over an office next to her school and opened up a special `` bureau '' . \nMen in black turbans -LRB- MIBTs as opposed to MIBs -RRB- stand around the gates of the bureau in clusters , scanning the girls and teachers entering the secondary school . \nThe dark , frowning figures stand ogling , leering and sometimes jeering at the ones not wearing a hijab or whose skirts are n't long enough . \nIn some areas , girls risk being attacked with acid if their clothes are n't `` proper '' . \nThe Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq -LRB- SCIRI - but I prefer `` SCAREY '' -RRB- was established in 1982 in Tehran . \nIts main goal is to import the concept of the `` Islamic Revolution '' from Iran to Iraq . \nIn other words , they believe that Iraq should be a theocracy led by Shia Mullahs . \nThe SCIRI would like to give the impression that they have the full support of all Shia Muslims in Iraq . \nThe truth is that many Shia Muslims are terrified of them and of the consequences of having them as a ruling power . \nAbdul Aziz Al-Hakim , the deputy leader of SCIRI , was responsible for torturing and executing Iraqi PoWs in Iran all through the Iran-Iraq war and after . \nShould SCIRI govern Iraq , I imagine the first step would be to open the borders with Iran and unite the two countries . \nBush can then stop referring to the two countries as a part of his infamous `` Axis of Evil '' and can just begin calling us the `` Big Lump of Evil and Bad North Korea '' . \nDo n't blame it on Islam . \nEvery religion has its extremists . \nIn times of chaos and disorder , those extremists flourish . \nIraq is full of moderate Muslims who simply believe in `` live and let live '' . \nWe get along with each other - Sunnis and Shia , Muslims and Christians , and Jews and Sabi'a . \nWe intermarry , we mix and mingle , we live . \nSomeone asked me if , through elections , the Iraqi people might vote for an Islamic state . \nSix months ago , I would have firmly said , `` No. '' Now , I 'm not so sure . \nA lot of you have been asking about my background and the reason why my English is good . \nI am Iraqi - born in Iraq to Iraqi parents , but was raised abroad for several years as a child . \nI came back in my early teens and continued studying English in Baghdad - reading any book I could get my hands on . \nMost of my friends are of different ethnicities , religions and nationalities . \nThere are thousands in Iraq like me - kids of diplomats , students , expatriates , etc. . \nI 'm a computer science graduate . \nBefore the war , I was working in an Iraqi database\\/software company located in Baghdad as a programmer\\/network administrator -LRB- yes , yes ... a geek -RRB- . \nEvery day , I would climb three flights of stairs , enter the little office I shared with one female colleague and two males , start up my PC and spend hours staring at little numbers and letters rolling across the screen . \nIt was tedious , it was back-breaking , it was geeky and it was ... wonderful . \nI came and went to work on my own . \nAt 8am I 'd walk in lugging a backpack filled with enough CDs , floppies , notebooks , chewed-on pens , paperclips and screwdrivers to make Bill Gates proud . \nWhat I 'm trying to say is that no matter what anyone heard , females in Iraq were a lot better off than females in other parts of the Arab world -LRB- and some parts of the western world - we had equal salaries ! -RRB- . \nWe were doctors , lawyers , nurses , teachers , professors , architects , programmers , and more . \nDuring the first week of June , I heard my company was back in business . \nIt took several hours , seemingly thousands of family meetings , but I finally convinced everyone that it was necessary for my sanity to go back to work . \nThey agreed that I would visit the company -LRB- with my two male bodyguards -RRB- and ask them if they had any work I could possibly take home and submit later on , or through the internet . \nOne fine day in mid-June , I packed my big bag of geeky wonders , put on my long skirt and shirt , tied back my hair and left the house with a mixture of anticipation and apprehension . \nWe had to park the car about 100m away from the door of the company because the major road in front of it was cracked and broken with the weight of the American tanks as they entered Baghdad . \nI half-ran , half-plodded up to the door , my heart throbbing at the thought of seeing friends , colleagues , secretaries ... just generally something familiar again in the strange new nightmare we were living . \nThe moment I walked through the door , everything looked shabbier somehow - sadder . \nThe lights were shattered , desks overturned , doors kicked in , and clocks torn from the walls . \nI stood a moment , hesitantly , in the door . \nThere were strange new faces . \nEveryone was standing around , looking at everyone else . \nAnd I was one of the only females . \nI weaved through the strange mess and made my way upstairs . \nMy little room was n't much better off than the rest of the building . \nThe desks were gone , papers all over the place ... but A was there ! \nI could n't believe it - a familiar , welcoming face . \nHe looked at me for a moment , without really seeing me , then his eyes opened wide and disbelief took over the initial vague expression . \nHe congratulated me on being alive , asked about my family and told me that he was n't coming back after today . \nI stood staring at the mess for a few moments longer , trying to sort out the mess in my head , my heart being torn to pieces . \nMy cousin and E were downstairs waiting for me - there was nothing more to do . \nA and I left the room and started making our way downstairs . \nWe paused on the second floor and stopped to talk to one of the former department directors . \nI asked him when they thought things would be functioning , he would n't look at me . \nHis eyes stayed glued to A 's face as he told him that females were n't welcome right now - especially females who `` could n't be protected '' . \nHe finally turned to me and told me , in so many words , to go home because `` they '' refused to be responsible for what might happen to me . \nI turned my back , walked down the stairs and went to find E and my cousin . \nSuddenly , the faces did n't look strange - they were the same faces of before , mostly , but there was a hostility I could n't believe . \nWhat was I doing here ? \nE and the cousin were looking grim , I must have been looking broken , because they rushed me out of the first place I had ever worked and to the car . \nI cried bitterly all the way home - cried for my job , cried for my future and cried for the torn streets , damaged buildings and crumbling people . \nYesterday , I read how it was going to take up to $ 90bn to rebuild Iraq . \nBremer -LRB- the former head of the US Occupation Authority -RRB- was shooting out numbers about how much it was going to cost to replace buildings and bridges and electricity , etc. . \nListen to this little anecdote . \nOne of my cousins works in a prominent engineering company in Baghdad , well-known for building bridges all over Iraq . \nMy cousin , a structural engineer , is a bridge freak . \nHe spends hours talking about pillars and trusses and steel structures to anyone who 'll listen . \nAs May was drawing to a close , his manager told him that someone from the CPA -LRB- Coalition Provisional Authority -RRB- wanted the company to estimate the building costs of replacing the New Diyala Bridge on the south-east end of Baghdad . \nHe got his team together , they went out and assessed the damage , decided it was n't too extensive , but it would be costly . \nThey did the necessary tests and analyses -LRB- mumblings about soil composition and water depth , expansion joints and girders -RRB- and came up with a number they tentatively put forward - $ 300,000 . \nThis included new plans and designs , raw materials -LRB- quite cheap in Iraq -RRB- , labor , contractors , travel expenses , etc. . \nLet 's pretend my cousin is a dolt . \nLet 's pretend he has n't been working with bridges for over 17 years . \nLet 's pretend he did n't work on replacing at least 20 of the 133 bridges damaged during the first Gulf war . \nLet 's pretend he 's wrong and the cost of rebuilding this bridge is four times the number they estimated - let 's pretend it will actually cost $ 1,200,000 . \nLet 's just use our imagination . \nA week later , the New Diyala Bridge contract was given to a US company . \nThis particular company estimated the cost of rebuilding the bridge would be around - brace yourselves - $ 50,000,000 !! Something you should know about Iraq : we have over 130,000 engineers . \nMore than half of these engineers are structural engineers and architects . \nMy brother , E , was out at 8am this morning getting gasoline for the car . \nHe came home at 12pm in a particularly foul mood . \nHe had waited in line of angry , hostile Iraqis for three hours . \nGasoline lines drive people crazy because , prior to the war , the price of gasoline in Iraq was ridiculously low . \nA litre of gasoline -LRB- unleaded -RRB- cost around 20 Iraqi dinars when one US dollar equalled 2,000 Iraqi dinars . \nIn other words , one litre of gasoline cost one cent ! \nA litre of bottled water cost more than gasoline . \nNot only does it cost more now , but it is n't easy to get . \nI think they 're importing gasoline from Saudi Arabia and Turkey . \nWe -LRB- a cousin , his wife , my mom and I -RRB- dragged E out of the house , at 12.30 to go visit my aunt on the other end of the city . \nWe heard the usual instructions before we left - stop at checkpoints , return before dark , and if anyone wants the car , give them the keys - do n't argue , do n't fight it . \nWe climbed into a battered , old , white 1984 Volkswagen - people are avoiding using `` nice '' cars that might tempt hijackers -LRB- `` nice '' is anything made after 1990 -RRB- . \nI mentally debated putting on sunglasses but decided against it - no need to attract any undue attention . \nI said a little prayer to keep us safe as I rummaged around in my bag , checking for my `` weapon '' . \nI ca n't stand carrying a pistol so I carry around a big , red , switchblade hunting knife - you do n't want to mess with Riverbend ... Being out in the streets is like being caught in a tornado . \nYou have to be alert and ready for anything every moment . \nI sat in the backseat , squinting into the sun , trying to determine if a particular face was that of a looter , or abductor , or just another angry country-man . \nI craned my neck looking at the blue SUV , trying to remember if it had been behind us for the last kilometre or longer . \nI held my breath nervously every time the cousin slowed down the car because of traffic , willing the cars in front of us to get a move on . \nThe ride that took 20-minutes pre-war Iraq took 45 minutes today . \nThere were major roads completely cut off by tanks . \nAngry troops stood cutting off access to the roads around the palaces -LRB- which were once Saddam 's but are now America 's palaces -RRB- . \nThe cousin and E debated alternative routes at every roadblock . \nI stayed silent because I do n't even know the city any more . \nNow , areas are identified as `` the one with the crater where the missile exploded '' , or `` the street with the ravaged houses '' , or `` the little house next to that one where that family was killed '' . \nThe looting and killing of today has changed from the looting and killing in April . \nIn April , it was quite random . \nNow they 're more organised than the CPA and the troops combined . \nNo one works alone anymore - they 've created gangs and armed militias . \nThey pull up to houses in minivans and SUVs , armed with machine guns and sometimes grenades . \nThey barge into the house and demand money and gold . \nIf they do n't find enough , they abduct a child or female and ask for ransom . \nSometimes the whole family is killed - sometimes only the male members of the family are killed . \nEver since the occupation , employees of the Ministry of Oil are being searched by troops - and lately , dogs . \nThe employees have been fed up ... the ministry itself is a virtual fortress now with concrete , barbed wire , and troops . \nThe employees stand around for hours at a time , waiting to be checked and let inside . \nToday , one of the women who works at the ministry , Amal , objected when the troops brought forward a dog to sniff her bag . \nShe was carrying a Qur ` an inside of it and , to even handle a Qur ` an , a Muslim has to be `` clean '' or under `` widhu '' . \n`` Widhu '' is the process of cleansing oneself for prayer or to read from the Qur ` an . \nWe simply wash the face , neck , arms up to the elbows and feet with clean water and say a few brief `` prayers '' . \nMuslims carry around small Qur ` ans for protection and we 've been doing it more often since the war - it gives many people a sense of security . \nIt does n't mean the person is a `` fundamentalist '' or `` extremist '' . \nAs soon as Amal protested about letting the dog sniff her bag because of the Qur ` an inside , the soldier grabbed the Qur ` an , threw it out of the bag , and proceeded to check it . \nThe lady was horrified and the dozens of employees who were waiting to be checked moved forward in a rage . \nAmal was put in handcuffs and taken away and the raging mob was greeted with the butts of rifles . \nThe Iraqi police arrived to try to intervene , and found the mob had turned from a security check into a demonstration . \nOne of the TV stations showed police officers tearing off their `` IP '' badge - a black arm badge to identify them as police and shouting at the camera , `` We do n't want the badge - we signed up to help the people , not see our Qur ` an thrown to the ground ... '' We heard the latest statement from Washington about Germany , France , Russia and Canada not being allowed to have anything to do with the reconstruction . \nIraq no longer feels like a country - it feels like war spoils : the winning team gets the pickings . \nThere have been huge demonstrations in the south these last few days and in Baghdad , demanding elections . \nI 'm torn on the topic of elections . \nWhile I want elections because it 's the `` democratic '' thing to do , I 'm afraid of the outcome . \nAll the signs lead one to believe that elections will lead to a theocracy -LRB- which I dread -RRB- . \nThe current GC is not representative of the Iraqi people - neither Sunnis nor Shia approve of them ... but will elections bring about a more representative group of would-be leaders ? \nFurthermore , what if the Iraqi `` majority '' do want a theocracy like the one in Iran ? \nIf the choice boils down to a democracy styled like the one in America or a theocracy styled like the one in Iran , how do you think a Muslim country is going to choose ? \nThere has been a lot of criticism about the way Al-Arabia and Al-Jazeera were covering the riots and fighting in Falluja and the south this last week . \nSome American spokesman for the military was ranting about the `` spread of anti-Americanism '' through networks like the abovementioned . \nActually , both networks did a phenomenal job of covering the attacks on Falluja and the southern provinces . \nAl-Jazeera had their reporter literally embedded in the chaos . \nAhmed Mansur , I believe his name was , was actually standing there , in the middle of the bombing , shouting to be heard over the F-16s and helicopters blasting away at houses . \nI think western news networks are far too tame . \nThey show the Hollywood version of war - strong troops in uniform , hostile Iraqis being captured and made to face `` justice '' and the White House turkey posing with the Thanksgiving turkey ... which is just fine . \nBut what about the destruction that comes with war and occupation ? \nWhat about the death ? \nI do n't mean just the images of dead Iraqis scattered all over , but dead Americans , too . \nPeople should have to see those images . \nStill , when I hear talk about `` anti-Americanism '' it angers me . \nWhy does America identify itself with its military and government ? \nWhy does being anti-Bush and anti-occupation have to mean that a person is anti-American ? \nWe watch American movies , listen to everything from Britney Spears to Nirvana and refer to every single brown , fizzy drink as `` Pepsi '' . \nI hate American foreign policy and its constant meddling in the region ... I hate American tanks in Baghdad and American soldiers on our streets and in our homes on occasion ... why does that mean that I hate America and Americans ? \nAre tanks , troops and violence the only face of America ? \nIf the Pentagon , Department of Defense and Condi are `` America , '' then , yes - I hate America . \nThe elections have come and gone . \nThe day of elections was a day of eerie silence punctuated by a few strong explosions and the hum of helicopters above . \nWe remained at home and watched the situation on TV . \nIt was like a voting marathon for all of the news channels - CNN , Euronews , BBC , Al-Jazeera , Al-Arabia , LBC ... everyone was talking elections . \nI literally had chills going up and down my spine as I watched Abdul Aziz Al-Hakim of Iranian-inclined SCIRI dropping his ballot into a box . \nBehind him , giving moral support and her vote , was what I can only guess to be his wife . \nShe was shrouded from head to foot and only her eyes peeped out of the endless sea of black . \nShe stuffed her ballot in the box with black-gloved hands and submissively followed a very confident Hakim . \nE turned to me with a smile and a wink , `` That might be you in a couple of years ... '' I promptly threw a sofa cushion at him . \nMost of our acquaintances -LRB- Sunni and Shia -RRB- did n't vote . \nWe 've been watching the protests about the Newsweek article with interest . \nI 'm not surprised at the turnout at these protests - the thousands of Muslims angry at the desecration of the Qur ` an . \nWhat did surprise me was the collective shock that seems to have struck the Islamic world like a slap in the face . \nAfter what happened in Abu Ghraib and other Iraqi prisons , how is this astonishing ? \nNow Newsweek have retracted the story - obviously under pressure from the White House . \nDetainees coming back after weeks or months in prison talk of being forced to eat pork , not being allowed to pray , being exposed to dogs , having Islam insulted . \nAt the end of the day , it 's not about words or holy books or pork or dogs or any of that . \nIt 's about what these things symbolise . \nIt 's not that all troops disrespect Islam - some of them seem to genuinely want to understand our beliefs . \nBut it does seem like the people in charge have decided to make degradation and humiliation a policy This is an edited extract from Baghdad Burning : Girl Blog From Iraq , by Riverbend , published on July 4 by Marion Boyars . \nTo order a copy for # 9.99 -LRB- inc p & p -RRB- , call 08708360875 -LRB- guardian . \n"}

'' \nThe existing drug-assisted therapy sessions last up to eight hours , during music is played . \nThe patients swallow a capsule containing a placebo or 125mg of MDMA - about the same or a little more than a typical ecstasy tablet . \nPsychologists assess the patients before and after the trial to judge whether the drug has helped . \nThe study has provoked controversy , because significant doubts remain about the long-term risks of ecstasy . \nAnimal studies suggest that it lowers levels of the brain chemical serotonin , and some politicians and anti-drug campaigners have argued that research into possible medical benefits of illegal drugs presents a falsely reassuring message . \nThe South Carolina study marks a resurgence of interest in the use of controlled psychedelic and hallucinogenic drugs . \nSeveral studies in the US are planned or are under way to investigate whether MDMA , LSD and psilocybin , the active ingredient in magic mushrooms , can treat conditions ranging from obsessive compulsive disorder to anxiety in terminal cancer patients . \n-LRB- - i think that 's unfair , he was a kid , no ? \nFor the paedo stuff he was a powerful adult . \n"}
{"id": "135", "time": "2005-06-27", "text": "Monday 27 June 2005 01.32 BST The US defense secretary , Donald Rumsfeld , yesterday warned that the insurgency in Iraq could go on for at least a decade and confirmed that the army had been in contact with some of its leaders in an attempt to quell the violence . \nHe spoke after insurgents launched coordinated suicide bomb attacks which killed at least 33 people and wounded dozens more in the northern city of Mosul . \nMr Rumsfeld said that Iraqis , not US troops , would eventually bring an end to attacks that have killed thousands of civilians and 1,730 American soldiers . \nHis downbeat assessment , during a television interview , was in stark contrast to a claim at the end of May by the vice presiden , Dick Cheney , that the insurgency was `` in its last throes '' . \nMr Rumsfeld said : `` We 're not going to win against the insurgency . \nThe Iraqi people are going to win against the insurgency . \nThat insurgency could go on for any number of years . \nInsurgencies tend to go on five , six , eight , 10 , 12 years . '' \nMr Rumsfeld confirmed that US officials were taking part in talks with insurgent leaders in Iraq . \nAsked about a report of two such meetings in yesterday 's Sunday Times , he told Fox News : `` Well , the first thing I would say about the meetings is they go on all the time . '' \nHe added that Iraq had a sovereign government which could choose its own relationships with different groups of insurgents . \n`` We facilitate those from time to time , '' Mr Rumsfeld said . \nAl-Qaida in Iraq and another Sunni extremist group , the Ansar al-Sunnah army , both issued statements on militant Islamic websites yesterday denying having held talks with US or Iraqi government officials . \nMr Rumsfeld made it clear that the talks had been with Iraqi insurgents rather than foreign fighters led by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi , a Jordanian extremist . \nHe told NBC television 's Meet the Press program : `` It is n't a matter of negotiating with terrorists . \nThere 's no one negotiating with Zarqawi or the people that are out chopping people 's heads off . '' \nGeneral John Abizaid , the commander of US forces in the Middle East said that both US and Iraqi officials were `` looking for the right people in the Sunni community to talk to ... and clearly we know that the vast majority of the insurgents are from the Sunni Arab community . '' \nAmid steadily declining support for the war in the US and conflicting signals from the Bush administration , Mr Rumsfeld went out of his way to lower American expectations of a quick victory . \nHe said : `` We 're going to create an environment that the Iraqi people and the Iraqi security forces can win against that insurgency . '' \nUS war objectives have been ratcheted down in recent months from establishing stability in Iraq to training sufficient numbers of Iraqi government troops to fight the insurgency independently . \nThe policy of lowering expectations however was thrown into confusion by Mr Cheney 's claim that the insurgency was `` in its last throes '' . \nThe claim appeared to take other administration officials by surprise and forced them into a string of semantic contortions to explain it . \n`` The fact is that if you look at the context of his remarks , last throes could be a violent last throe , just as well as a placid or calm last throe . \nLook it up in the dictionary , '' Mr Rumsfeld said yesterday . \nHe added : `` There 's no question but that the enemy is a thinking enemy , that their attacks are more lethal than they had been previously . \nThey 're killing a lot more Iraqis . '' \nThe defense secretary 's back-to-back television appearances were part of a concerted administration campaign to convince the American public it has a winning strategy in Iraq amid falling home support . \nThat public relations campaign will reach its peak tomorrow night with a prime-time address to the nation by President George Bush , who will call for popular resolve in support of the nation 's 135,000 troops still in Iraq . \n"}

' \nSamantha 's husband was the first soldier to die in action in the Iraq war and this time last year the 34-year-old was scarcely out of the press , as a result of a highly personal campaign to uncover the circumstances of her husband 's death . \nSteve , a 33-year-old sergeant from the 2nd Royal Tank Regiment , was shot in the stomach and chest by ` friendly fire ' in March 2003 as he was trying to calm a demonstration near Basra . \nHours earlier he had been told to hand over his flak jacket to a soldier who was not equipped with one . \nSamantha was cast as the feisty widow from west Yorkshire who could bring down the Defense Secretary , Geoff Hoon , who appeared to be on the ropes following the furore over the death of government scientist Dr David Kelly . \nThe ` showdown ' between grieving widow and minister , as the papers put it , took place a year ago this week . \nIt was not until eight months after that low point that Samantha felt that she was coming to terms with Steve 's death . \nThe occasion was when she met 30 other bereaved women at Amport House , the Armed Forces Chaplaincy Centre , near Andover in Hampshire . \nThe chaplain talked about how grief affects people differently . \n` Up to that point I had never had anyone explain to me just what happens when you grieve , ' she says . \n` He talked for about 45 minutes and it shocked me when he described exactly how I felt . ' \nIt was those few days that led her and the other women to set up a new group , the Army Widows Association , to provide a lifeline for the women who lose loved ones in the armed forces . \nThe group aims to help widows get back on their feet by providing vital information on pension rights , accommodation entitlements and , most importantly , creating a network of women who share the same experience . \nHeather Saunders , another founding member of the group , was at the Amport House meeting . \n` Our husbands were taken from us ; they did n't choose to leave us , ' she says . \n` It is a shattering thing and what you want is support from other people who have been through it . ' \nHeather 's husband , Stephen , was defense attach at the British embassy in Athens when he was shot dead by two men on a motorbike as he drove to work . \n` People often come up and they sympathise , but how the hell do they know how I feel ? ' \n` They have n't a clue . ' \nThe War Widows Association , a powerful political force , especially on pension rights , welcomes the new group . \nThere are 47,000 war widows and 70 per cent are over 80 . \nDebbie Bowles , the group 's press officer , lost her husband in an aircraft crash 14 years ago over the North Sea . ' \nI remember going to church on a Sunday and thinking I ought to be sitting with the old ladies now I 'm a widow - but I was only 32 , ' she says . \n` You get a sense of understanding through knowing someone of your age who has been through it as well . ' \nArmy widows often feel isolated . \nGeraldine McCool , a partner at the law firm McCool Patterson Hemsi , specialises in claims against the military . \nShe represents more than 20 families of Iraqi servicemen , including Samantha Roberts , as well as the families of those killed in large-scale accidents , such as the 25 anti-terrorist experts who died when an RAF Chinook crashed in fog on the Mull of Kintyre in 1994 . \n` If you are living on base , you 're part of army life , ' she says . \n` If you lose your husband , then , in a way , you lose your wider family , which is the backing of the military community . ' \nThe military can be very supportive to the bereaved if you embrace that life , she says , but it can also cut women adrift socially and in other ways . \nFor example , the loss of a partner in the armed forces can mean the end of your subsidised home and perks such as Council Tax contributions , travel warrants , access to child care and creche or boarding school allowances . \n` Women have often sacrificed their careers to follow their husbands , ' Geraldine McCool points out . \n` For obvious reasons , it is extremely difficult to keep careers going on short-term deployments , particularly abroad . ' \nUnfortunately war widows ' pensions are not particularly generous -LRB- and end if you re-marry -RRB- . \nSamantha Roberts , who has no children , receives # 600 from her husband 's pension plus a war widow 's pension of # 90 . \n` That 's pretty insulting since Steve gave 15 years to the army and ultimately gave them his life , ' she says . \nShe has always lived outside army quarters and been financially independent . \nOccasionally the Ministry of Defense acts with crass insensitivity . \nTake the case of Lianne Seymour , whose husband Ian Seymour , a Royal Marine , died when a US helicopter crashed in Kuwait at the start of the Iraq conflict in 2003 . \nThree days later she was told that she and her three-year-old son had six months to vacate their MoD-owned home and that she would have to return nine days ' wages paid to her husband in error . \nMrs Seymour later received a personal apology from Geoff Hoon . \nThe women behind the new Army Widows Association hope that they can help the army develop a new sensitivity . \nThey are particularly concerned about the lack of training for liaison officers appointed to assist the bereaved . \nOne widow recalls how the delegated soldier arrived at her house to drive her to pick up her husband 's body from the airport . \n` It was the second worst day of my life , ' she recalls . \n` But he turned up , full of the joys of spring , and the first thing he did was hand me this joke he 'd just been emailed . \nIt was in such bad taste and possibly the most inappropriate thing he could have done . ' \nArmy liaison officers are often ` the nearest person at the time ' , reports Heather Saunders . \n` They 're reading their brief on `` How to be a counsellor '' on their way to see a widow for the first time , ' she adds . \nMost importantly , the women hope that the group will help others through the bureaucratic fight for information with the MoD that takes over many women 's lives . \n` The army shies away from dealing with widows because they seem to think any sign of admitting fault or showing compassion will mean everyone is going to be on their back and suing them for thousands of pounds , ' says Heather Saunders . \nYou can contact the Army Widows Association at S4 , the Ministry of Defense 's Casualty Cell , on 01980 615959 . \nThe War Widows Association can be contacted on on 08702411305 or see its website at www.warwidowsassociation.org.uk Letters for publication should be sent to : letters@observer.co.uk If you need help using the site : userhelp@guardian.co.uk Call the main Guardian and Observer switchboard : ' I lost my husband in the war but now I 've found a lifeline ' 00.32 GMT on Sunday 30 January 2005 \n"}
{"id": "43", "time": "2005-01-30", "text": "It 's time to bin the past Fred Halliday , a leading expert on international affairs , says we are still infected by Cold War ills : an arrogant West , shabby dictators , naive protests Sunday 30 January 2005 01.25 GMT The thinkers and managers of world hegemony met amid the snow in Davos , Swizerland , last week while the anti-globalisation forces convened in the tropical summer of Porto Alegre , Brazil . \nAs they assembled , the international system presented a much clearer picture than that through which the world had moved in the 14 years since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War . \nIn America we can see a President resolute in international bellicosity and a national consensus arrogantly indifferent to external concerns . \nWe can also see the impact , within the US and internationally , of 9\\/11 . \nThe battle lines are drawn . \nAl-Qaeda does not have the capacity to destroy the West , but it does have the capacity to mobilise for years to come . \nIn Ariel Sharon and George Bush it has found two stalwart recruiting sergeants . \nMore important still has been the consolidated rise of China . \nAfter five centuries when the Atlantic was the strategic and economic center of the world , the focus has shifted to East Asia and the Pacific . \nThis , not Iraq , is the dominant story of 2004 . \nLast year marked the end of the interregnum following the end of the Cold War , the third chapter in the great European civil war in which the two world wars marked the initial two chapters . \nYet this apparent distance between the contemporary world and the Cold War is delusory and dangerously so . \nThe intellectual challenge is how to characterise this condition . \nWe have had some grand , if preposterous , theories : the New World Order , the New Middle Ages , the End of History , the Clash of Civilisations , now the War Against Terrorism . \nIn an attempt to comprehend the contemporary international system , this article proposes another narrative : the Three Dustbins Theory . \nThe Three Dustbins Theory rests on the claim that , despite the receding of the Cold War , we remain , in key respects , prisoners of its legacy and will , unless we face up to these questions , remain so . \nAs with all unacknowledged influences from the past , these repositories of conflict and myth are all the more powerful because unacknowledged . \nDustbin Number One contains the legacies of the Soviet and communist periods . \nAmong its contents are : an array of uncontrolled and unmonitored nuclear materials ; a set of unresolved , sanguinary inter-ethnic problems inherited from the Soviet period - Bosnia , Kosovo , Transdniestr , Nagorno-Karabakh , Chechnya , Eritrea-Ethiopia - in all of which the costs of ethnic expulsion and fragmented government have provided a context for entrenched mafioso power ; and the consolidation , in nearly all of the former Soviet Union and much of former pro-Soviet Africa -LRB- as in the Horn of Africa and Mozambique -RRB- of corrupt elites , a transition not to democracy but to post-Marxist kleptocracy . \nMost significant of all of these is the political character of the two most important states to have undergone the communist experiment : the neo-authoritarian dictatorship of Vladimir Putin in Russia , and the politically immobile dictatorship of the communist leaders in China . \nNo transition to democracy here and none likely , not least because these two groups of rulers play the coquette to Washington in the matter of their ` wars ' against Chechen and Sinkiang opponents . \nThe Second Dustbin is that of the West , and the US in particular . \nOne of the costs of winning the Cold War is that the West has failed to rethink its assumptions about the conduct of international relations . \nInstead , and above all with the Bush administration , we have seen the recycling , often by veterans of the confrontations with the Soviet Union in the 1970s , of policies that were as wrong then as they are now : the fabrication of threats , accompanied by dire warnings about how time ` is running out ' , about hostile states ; the repetition ad nauseam of platitudes about the role of force in international affairs that no first-year student could get away with ; a suspicion , if not disdain , for international institutions , notably the UN and international law ; a facile , historically short-sighted and grossly exaggerated set of claims about how many states conform to an acceptable model of democracy -LRB- the ` Free World ' of the 1950s and 1960s recycled -RRB- . \nOf the cruel , and intellectually bankrupt , certainties of neo-liberalism , which has undermined the social provision and regulation roles of the state across the world , there is no need to say more . \nMeanwhile , US neo-conservative family planning policy , by blocking the use of contraception and abortion , is in league with the patriarch of St Peter 's Square , condemning millions to avoidable death . \nHowever , the greatest , and least acknowledged , legacies of the Cold War on the Western side lie in two other domains . \nHere pervasive denial , compounded by self-righteous declamation , reign supreme . \nOne such legacy concerns the origins of the terrorist threat itself : al-Qaeda and its like did not arise suddenly in 2001 , or from the subconscious of the Islamic or Arab minds , but from the Cold War , in particular the financing , training and arming of tens of thousands of jihadi militants by the US , Saudi Arabia and Pakistan for the war in Afghanistan in the 1980s . \nThat war was to the early 21st century what the Spanish Civil War was to the mid-20th , the devils kitchen in which the criminal practices later unleashed on the world were first brewed . \nIt is the greatest , if not the only , solecism of Bush 's anti-terrorist campaign that he is incapable , as is American public opinion as a whole , of recognizing how far the US helped to prepare this movement , as it did the Unita murderers in Angola , the Contras in Nicaragua , and , at one remove , Renamo in Mozambique . \nThe other , now more evident than ever , legacy of Cold War on the Western side is both simple and all-pervasive : the mental attitude accompanying the exercise of power over other peoples , and the discussion of it , by Washington , one predominantly of arrogance , ignorance and instinctive resort to force . \nThis mindset , often decked out with frothing claims about ` imperial burdens ' and ` grand strategy ' , was evident in the Cold War itself , not least in the grotesque continuation of a nuclear arms race over four decades , but also draws in the US , as it does in much of post-imperial Europe , on the unacknowledged cultural legacy of colonialism . \nThe West has still not learned to treat the rest of the world on an equal footing , a point most graphically illustrated by the photographs from Abu Ghraib : it is , above all , not because the victims were Muslim , Arab , or even non-white , but because they were from a subordinate people that they were subjected with such levity and sadism to their tortures . \nIt might be thought prudent to stop the argument there , with a denunciation of the powerful in East and West . \nBut the unacknowledged legacy of the Cold War does not stop there , and is equally to be found among those protesting against globalisation and meeting in Porto Alegre . \nThe Third Dustbin is that of the contemporary global protest movement , to a considerable degree a children 's crusade of intellectual demagogues , recycled 1960s bunkeristas with their fellow travellers in literary circles , dreamers and political manipulators , of the old and new lefts , whose claim to moral and analytic superiority too often masks a set of unexamined , and themselves often recycled , platitudes from the Cold War period and , indeed , from the ideology of the communist world . \nIt is as if , having appeared to die in Moscow in 1991 , the anti-capitalist world movement leapt from the coffin , like James Joyce 's corpse Finegan at his Wake , at Seattle in 1999 , having learned nothing at all . \nIndeed the contents of this Third Dustbin are familiar enough : a ritual incantantion of ` no war ' that avoids any substantive engagement with problems of international peace and security , or reflection on how positively to help peoples in zones of conflict ; a set of vague , unthought out , uncosted and often dangerous utopian ideas about an alternative world ; a pleasing but vapid invocation of global human values and internationalism that blithely ignores the misuses to which that term was put in the 20th century -LRB- for example by Stalin or Mao -RRB- ; a complacent attitude , innocent when not indulgent , towards political violence -LRB- witness the cult of Che Guevara , a cruel and dangerous man , and the invitees from Northern Ireland , Palestine and Iran , to name but three at the London Social Summit in October -RRB- . \nThis was a capitulation , that would have shocked their socialist forebears , to nationalist and religious bigots -LRB- as in the reception by the supposedly left-wing Mayor of London of Sheikh Yusif al-Qaradawi , the descendant of a line of Mus lim fascist thinkers -RRB- . \nThere is also a vapid and politically ineffective attitude to nature , forgetting , as the tsunami should have reminded all of us , that nature can also kill . \nAnd all of this is mixed up with a shallow , repetitive critique of globalisation , in the name of what we are never sure , and a naive , uninformed , analysis of the US . \nSuch a critique applies , in the first place , to the Western and affiliated Third World protest movement . \nBut it applies with even greater force to the murderous vapidities promulgated by the most prominent alternative center of resistance , that of radical Sunni jihadism , be it of Bin Laden or al-Zarqawi : these people are devoid of any substantive ideas about how to run a modern society , economy or political system . \nHere is in essence the Three Dustbins Theory . \nThat unchallenged ideas and political legacies take their toll was familiar to the wise of earlier times . \nMarx remarked that the legacy of past generations weighs like a nightmare on the brain of the living . \nKeynes said that behind the ideas of every politician lay the thought of some dead economist . \nFreud warned us of the toll taken by the repressed . \nAll would find much that is familiar in the world today . \nWe can assess the outcome of discussions in Davos and Porto Alegre to see if thinking on the current crises of the world has moved on . \nHere ideas and policies should meet what I term the ` Vilanova Test ' , named after the flinty Spanish writer Pere Vilanova , who , on the basis of years of political engagement and debate in Spain and the Arab world , has argued consistently for pensamiento duro , ` tough thinking ' , in the contemporary world . \nWe certainly have , and may again be treated to , plenty of the other . \nFred Halliday 's ` The International Relations of the Middle East ' -LRB- CUP -RRB- and ` One Hundred Myths About the Middle East ' -LRB- Saqi -RRB- will be published in the spring Letters for publication should be sent to : letters@observer.co.uk If you need help using the site : userhelp@guardian.co.uk Call the main Guardian and Observer switchboard : This article was published on guardian . \n"}
{"id": "201", "time": "2005-06-20", "text": "He was a Foreign Office diplomat on the fast track to an ambassadorship and knighthood . \nSo why , after 15 years at the top , did Carne Ross turn his back on the power and the status to go freelance ? \nCarne Ross : ` I 'd read the intelligence on WMD for four and a half years , and there 's no way that it could sustain the case that the government was presenting . ' \nPhotograph : Sarah Lee Carne Ross must have been an unusual schoolboy . \nHe did n't dream of being a footballer , a cricketer or even an engine driver . \nHe dreamed of being a diplomat . \n`` At quite a young age , '' he recalls , `` I realized that I was fascinated by abroad . \nI decided quite early on that I was going to become a diplomat , and was very discouraged by everybody saying it was incredibly difficult and that only very clever people became diplomats . '' \nAt 22 , fresh out of Exeter University , Ross proved the doubters wrong : he passed the necessary exams , joined the Foreign Office 's graduate fast-track , worked at the UK embassy in Bonn and its mission to the UN , enjoyed a good salary , status , even a sniff of power , and was on course to an ambassadorship with obligatory knighthood . \nThen , last September , the dream turned to dust . \nHe quit - part of the diplomatic fallout from the Iraq war - to be an `` independent diplomat '' . \nA contradiction in terms , according to some of his Foreign Office friends , but not according to the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust , which last week chose Ross as one of its seven `` visionaries for a just and peaceful world '' . \nFor the next five years , the trust will pay him a stipend of almost # 40,000 a year to attempt to prove his former colleagues wrong and turn his vision of what might be called committed diplomacy - putting right before might and morality before national interest - into reality . \nRoss , a confident , crop-haired 38-year-old , spent 15 years in the Foreign Office . \nHe loved the life but ultimately hated having to bend the truth on behalf of his country . \nThe gradual process of disillusionment began in Germany in the mid-1990s when refugees from the war in Yugoslavia flooded into the country . \n`` We of course supported the British policy that the war in Yugoslavia was a civil war and that an arms embargo was a fair way of treating all the parties , '' he says . \n`` This was deeply mistaken and inhuman . \nIn effect it enabled one group to genocidally pursue another . \nThe war was born of a grasp for power by Milosevic and his henchmen on the back of an invented Serb nationalism . '' \nIt took Ross almost a decade to realize the full extent of the mistakes the Foreign Office made in the Balkans . \nHis lack of faith in British policy in the Middle East manifested itself far more quickly . \nFrom 1995-98 he worked in London on the Middle East peace process and as speechwriter to foreign secretary Malcolm Rifkind , before joining the British delegation at the UN , where the issue of Iraq - he was the key British negotiator with the Iraqi government and the weapons inspectors - was soon to take over his life . \nHe says the New York posting , which occupied him for almost five years , was `` dramatic '' , `` exciting '' , `` challenging '' . \nThe hours were long but he enjoyed the drama - trying to work out what the Iraqis were doing , negotiating resolutions in the security council , being pursued by film crews desperate to understand where the diplomatic dance was leading . \nBut , in Ross 's mind , one word obliterates all those others - `` guilt '' . \n`` I think sanctions -LRB- against Iraq -RRB- were wrong and they harmed the wrong people , '' he says . \n`` They did immeasurable damage to the Iraqi civilian population . \nWe were conscious of that damage , but we did too little to address it . \nWe said we were trying to address it , but frankly it was n't enough and I 'm not proud of my own role in that because I was a vigorous defender of British policy in the security council . \nWe would not have treated a European or American people in that way . '' \nRoss was in New York on September 11 2001 and his recollection of the attack on the World Trade Centre is vivid . \n`` I saw the first plane go over and then went to a ludicrous EU meeting which dragged on as reports were coming in of the attacks , '' he recalls . \n`` The meeting ended after both planes struck . \nThe UN building was evacuated and we were sent home . \nMy home was downtown , so I walked back against this flood of people coming the other way - people covered in ashes and weeping . \nI went to my apartment on the south side of Union Square which looks south over lower Manhattan . \nI watched all afternoon , watched this huge pall of smoke which did n't go away for weeks . \nYou could smell it in the apartment and in the streets around for weeks afterwards . '' \nThe lesson he draws from 9\\/11 is of the compassion of New Yorkers and the way political leaders in the US and UK misjudged the mood . \n`` There was no desire for vengeance among people on the streets , '' he says . \n`` Union Square became a collecting point for people to light candles , pray , sing , grieve . \nI 'd make my way through these crowds every day and it affected me very profoundly . \nTragically , that compassion is something that the governments of both the US and Britain have seemed to ignore since . '' \nIn the wake of 9\\/11 , Ross was given responsibility for UK policy on Afghanistan . \nHe quickly realized that meant preparing for war . \nWhen the invasion came , he spent six weeks in Kabul negotiating with warlords . \nAgain his account tempers the excitement of the moment with the disillusionment of having to come to terms with what could be achieved . \nThe allies did n't understand Afghanistan , did n't have sufficient forces on the ground , were trapped in their fortified compounds , were naive about the willingness of the warlords to cede power , and were far too optimistic in their belief that opium production could be curtailed . \nHe returned to New York and , increasingly doubtful of the wisdom of British policy in the Middle East , decided to take a year-long sabbatical , joining the graduate international affairs program at the New School in Greenwich Village , where he studied a subject of which Donald Rumsfeld might approve - the limits of knowledge in decision-making . \n`` I was ultimately trying to grasp the claim in diplomacy , and in policy-making in general , to knowledge , '' explains Ross , `` because I had doubts about the whole thing . \nWhat is it that we know , how do we know it and how can we make policy on the basis of that knowledge ? \nExamining the theory helped crystallise a lot of my doubts . '' \nWhile he was on sabbatical , Britain and the US invaded Iraq and Ross 's doubts turned to anger . \n`` I was very close to my former colleagues in the mission and was in touch with a lot of the diplomats at the security council , '' he says . \n`` I was very conscious of what the British government was doing , and I was very sceptical of it . \nI contemplated resigning at the time and making a fuss , but felt that resigning would be standing up in front of a runaway train and I 'd just be crushed . \n`` It was an agonised experience because I knew that the evidence they were presenting for WMD was totally implausible . \nI 'd read the intelligence on WMD for four and a half years , and there 's no way that it could sustain the case that the government was presenting . \nAll of my colleagues knew that , too . \nWe all believed the Iraqis had something , but that is very different from saying they had that much . \nThe intelligence indicated that they 'd failed to account for what they had in the past . \nThey had n't given us a complete account of the disposal of their past stocks , so we thought there was something , but there was no way that the claim of an imminent threat was sustainable . \nThe 45-minute stuff was ridiculous . '' \nHe had lost faith in the Foreign Office but had no idea what to do with his life , so at the end of his sabbatical year he engineered a compromise - a secondment to the UN in Kosovo . \nIn the summer of 2004 , he supplied a secret , written testimony to the Butler inquiry on intelligence and weapons of mass destruction . \nThe act of giving evidence finally brought his career as a British diplomat to an end . \n`` I told -LRB- the inquiry -RRB- what I knew in terms of the evidence on WMD and what the inspectors told me during the four and a half years that I dealt with it , '' he says . \n`` I also wrote down my views on the available alternatives to war , which were fairly forthright . \nI felt that war should be the last alternative , and emphatically it was not in this case . \nThere was a very good alternative to war that was never properly pursued , which was to close down Saddam 's sources of illegal revenue . \nThat testimony crystallised what I felt about the Iraq issue , and once I 'd written it I felt there was no going back . \nI had to quit . \nI could n't honestly work for this government with a smile on my face . '' \nIt was a bold , some would say foolhardy , step . \nRoss gave up everything - income , status , what he calls the `` grandeur '' of the Foreign Office . \nHe wrote to the permanent undersecretary and to the political adviser to the secretary of state stating his reasons for resigning ; neither replied . \nSome former colleagues were `` indifferent to the point of rudeness '' ; he does n't know whether they took his resignation as an implied criticism of their own actions or whether they thought him mad . \n`` I had a very good career under way and it was a huge sacrifice , '' he says . \n`` I 'd always wanted to be a diplomat , so it was a very painful decision . \nI still feel sad about it when I walk past the Foreign Office . \nBut in the end I felt I had no choice . \nAlthough diplomacy and the Foreign Office was a deeply satisfying and enjoyable career , it was n't answering to a deeper part of my soul . '' \nHis wife Carmen - a Croatian-born film-maker living in New York when they met - gave Ross the idea of offering his diplomatic skills on a freelance basis . \nHenceforth he would not be beholden to the British government but to his own conscience , and his policy advice would be steered not by national interest but by the alleviation of suffering . \nIndependent Diplomat , the slogan of which is `` A diplomatic service for those who need it most '' , was born . \nRoss is currently advising the government of Kosovo and trying to raise awareness of the Saharawi people , displaced by Morocco 's long-standing occupation of the western Sahara . \nHe hopes the Rowntree money will enable him to start building a global network of diplomats and lawyers who can help emerging governments or `` political groups struggling to make their case heard '' . \nIndependent diplomats will not dissimulate , sit on the fence or hide behind national interests ; their instincts will be to help the marginalised and oppressed ; they will take sides . \n`` I often felt as a British diplomat that the things I really wanted to do were help the people who were less privileged than us , '' he says . \n`` I do n't believe in the received wisdom about what foreign policy is about . \nI do n't believe in things like British interests and the calculus of security and trade and all the rest of it . \nI think it 's mostly manufactured . '' \nHe holds up his present preoccupation , the refugees of the western Sahara , as a test case for his new approach . \n`` If you look at these people suffering in a refugee camp in the middle of the desert , most British people would think that was wrong and that something should be done . \nYet British policy is to do nothing because British interests dictate that fairly minuscule trade with Morocco is more important . \nAt the UN I used to perform these calculations myself and send telegrams saying we had no interest in supporting the Saharawi cause . \nAt the Foreign Office you are taught to think that trade and market share and security are the most important things , and that human suffering is not important if it 's nothing to do with Britain . \nI disagree with that analysis . \nThe best way to a safer and more peaceful world is through alleviating suffering . \nSimplicity is the only thing that works in a complex world .

'' \nHe said decisions not to deliver to some areas were taken by local managers , but insisted there was no `` blanket list '' of problem areas . \n`` Where there is an area we have had problems with , the local manager would make a decision that they wo n't deliver for a while until it has settled down , '' he said . \n`` It 's a case of the manager talking to his driver and saying , ` How do you feel about this ? ' \nHe might say , ` It 's getting a bit hairy out there , ' and a decision might be made that it 's not safe . '' \nThere are thought to be about two dozen postal areas in Britain on the company 's blacklist at any time , but DHL refused to say where they were . \nMany are thought to be council estates and tower blocks in inner-city areas . \nThe list is not permanent , and areas can be taken off the list if the situation improves . \nMr Zamoyski said he was not aware of any surge in attacks . \nDHL was one of the first companies to open in Baghdad after the fall of Saddam Hussein , and also operates in Afghanistan and North Korea . \nThe company opened in Baghdad only days after the Iraq war ended . \nOne of its transport planes was hit by a shoulder-launched rocket as it left Baghdad airport in November 2003 , but managed to land safely . \nThe spokesman said DHL was able to deliver there because of local arrangements . \nHe said : '' -LRB- Iraq and Britain -RRB- are very different cases . \nThere are local security arrangements applicable in every country , and they differ .

{"id": "347", "time": "2005-06-29", "text": "Full text : George Bush 's Iraq speech Full text of President George Bush 's speech at Fort Bragg , North Carolina , as provided by the White House Wednesday 29 June 2005 03.07 BST Thank you and good evening . \nI am pleased to visit Fort Bragg , home of the Airborne and Special Operations Forces . \nIt is an honor to speak before you tonight . \nMy greatest responsibility as president is to protect the American people , and that is your calling as well . \nI thank you for your service , your courage and your sacrifice . \nI thank your families , who support you in your vital work . \nThe soldiers and families of Fort Bragg have contributed mightily to our efforts to secure our country and promote peace . \nAmerica is grateful and so is your commander in chief . \nThe troops here and across the world are fighting a global war on terror . \nThis war reached our shores on September 11 2001 . \nThe terrorists who attacked us and the terrorists we face murder in the name of a totalitarian ideology that hates freedom , rejects tolerance and despises all dissent . \nTheir aim is to remake the Middle East in their own grim image of tyranny and oppression by toppling governments , driving us out of the region and exporting terror . \nTo achieve these aims , they have continued to kill in Madrid , Istanbul , Jakarta , Casablanca , Riyadh , Bali and elsewhere . \nThe terrorists believe that free societies are essentially corrupt and decadent , and with a few hard blows they can force us to retreat . \nAfter September 11 , I made a commitment to the American people : This nation will not wait to be attacked again . \nWe will take the fight to the enemy . \nWe will defend our freedom . \nIraq is the latest battlefield in this war . \nMany terrorists who kill innocent men , women and children on the streets of Baghdad are followers of the same murderous ideology that took the lives of our citizens in New York , Washington and Pennsylvania . \nThere is only one course of action against them : to defeat them abroad before they attack us at home . \nThe commander in charge of coalition operations in Iraq , who is also senior commander at this base , General John Vines , put it well the other day . \nHe said , `` We either deal with terrorism and this extremism abroad , or we deal with it when it comes to us . '' \nOur mission in Iraq is clear . \nWe are hunting down the terrorists . \nWe are helping Iraqis build a free nation that is an ally in the war on terror . \nWe are advancing freedom in the broader Middle East . \nWe are removing a source of violence and instability and laying the foundation of peace for our children and our grandchildren . \nThe work in Iraq is difficult and dangerous . \nLike most Americans , I see the images of violence and bloodshed . \nEvery picture is horrifying and the suffering is real . \nAmid all this violence , I know Americans ask the question : Is the sacrifice worth it ? \nIt is worth it , and it is vital to the future security of our country . \nAnd tonight I will explain the reasons why . \nSome of the violence you see in Iraq is being carried out by ruthless killers who are converging on Iraq to fight the advance of peace and freedom . \nOur military reports that we have killed or captured hundreds of foreign fighters in Iraq who have come from Saudi Arabia , Syria , Iran , Egypt , Sudan , Yemen , Libya and other nations . \nThey are making common cause with criminal elements , Iraqi insurgents and remnants of Saddam Hussein 's regime who want to restore the old order . \nThey fight because they know that the survival of their hateful ideology is at stake . \nThey know that as freedom takes root in Iraq , it will inspire millions across the Middle East to claim their liberty as well . \nAnd when the Middle East grows in democracy , prosperity and hope , the terrorists will lose their sponsors , lose their recruits and lose their hopes for turning that region into a base for attacks on America and our allies around the world . \nSome wonder whether Iraq is a central front in the war on terror . \nAmong the terrorists , there is no debate . \nHear the words of Osama Bin Laden : `` This Third World War is raging '' in Iraq . \n`` The whole world is watching this war . '' \nHe says it will end in `` victory and glory or misery and humiliation . '' \nThe terrorists know that the outcome will leave them emboldened or defeated . \nSo they are waging a campaign of murder and destruction . \nAnd there is no limit to the innocent lives they are willing to take . \nWe see the nature of the enemy in terrorists who exploded car bombs along a busy shopping street in Baghdad , including one outside a mosque . \nWe see the nature of the enemy in terrorists who sent a suicide bomber to a teaching hospital in Mosul . \nAnd we see the nature of the enemy in terrorists who behead civilian hostages and broadcast their atrocities for the world to see . \nThese are savage acts of violence but they have not brought the terrorists any closer to achieving their strategic objectives . \nThe terrorists , both foreign and Iraqi , failed to stop the transfer of sovereignty . \nThey failed to break our coalition and force a mass withdrawal by our allies . \nThey failed to incite an Iraqi civil war . \nThey failed to prevent free elections . \nThey failed to stop the formation of a democratic Iraqi government that represents all of Iraq 's diverse population . \nAnd they failed to stop Iraqis from signing up in large numbers with the police forces and the army to defend their new democracy . \nThe lesson of this experience is clear : The terrorists can kill the innocent but they can not stop the advance of freedom . \nThe only way our enemies can succeed is if we forget the lessons of September 11 , if we abandon the Iraqi people to men like Zarqawi and if we yield the future of the Middle East to men like bin Laden . \nFor the sake of our nation 's security , this will not happen on my watch . \nA little over a year ago , I spoke to the nation and described our coalition 's goal in Iraq . \nI said that America 's mission in Iraq is to defeat an enemy and give strength to a friend , a free , representative government that is an ally in the war on terror and a beacon of hope in a part of the world that is desperate for reform . \nI outlined the steps we would take to achieve this goal : We would hand authority over to a sovereign Iraqi government ; we would help Iraqis hold free elections by January 2005 ; we would continue helping Iraqis rebuild their nation 's infrastructure and economy ; we would encourage more international support for Iraq 's democratic transition ; and we would enable Iraqis to take increasing responsibility for their own security and stability . \nIn the past year , we have made significant progress : One year ago today , we restored sovereignty to the Iraqi people . \nIn January 2005 , more than 8 million Iraqi men and women voted in elections that were free and fair and took place on time . \nWe continued our efforts to help them rebuild their country . \nRebuilding a country after three decades of tyranny is hard and rebuilding while at war is even harder . \nOur progress has been uneven but progress is being made . \nWe are improving roads and schools and health clinics and working to improve basic services like sanitation , electricity and water . \nAnd together with our allies , we will help the new Iraqi government deliver a better life for its citizens . \nIn the past year , the international community has stepped forward with vital assistance . \nSome 30 nations have troops in Iraq , and many others are contributing nonmilitary assistance . \nThe United Nations is in Iraq to help Iraqis write a constitution and conduct their next elections . \nThus far , some 40 countries and three international organizations have pledged about 34 billion dollars in assistance for Iraqi reconstruction . \nMore than 80 countries and international organizations recently came together in Brussels to coordinate their efforts to help Iraqis provide for their security and rebuild their country . \nAnd next month , donor countries will meet in Jordan to support Iraqi reconstruction . \nWhatever our differences in the past , the world understands that success in Iraq is critical to the security of all our nations . \nAs German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said at the White House yesterday , `` There can be no question a stable and democratic Iraq is in the vested interest of not just Germany , but also Europe . '' \nFinally , we have continued our efforts to equip and train Iraqi security forces . \nWe have made gains in both the number and quality of those forces . \nToday Iraq has more than 160,000 security forces trained and equipped for a variety of missions . \nIraqi forces have fought bravely helping to capture terrorists and insurgents in Najaf , Samarra , Fallujah and Mosul . \nAnd in the past month , Iraqi forces have led a major anti-terrorist campaign in Baghdad called Operation Lightning , which has led to the capture of hundreds of suspected insurgents . \nLike free people everywhere , Iraqis want to be defended by their own countrymen , and we are helping Iraqis assume those duties . \nThe progress in the past year has been significant and we have a clear path forward . \nTo complete the mission , we will continue to hunt down the terrorists and insurgents . \nTo complete the mission , we will prevent al-Qaida and other foreign terrorists from turning Iraq into what Afghanistan was under the Taliban - a safe haven from which they could launch attacks on America and our friends . \nAnd the best way to complete the mission is to help Iraqis build a free nation that can govern itself , sustain itself and defend itself . \nSo our strategy going forward has both a military track and a political track . \nThe principal task of our military is to find and defeat the terrorists and that is why we are on the offense . \nAnd as we pursue the terrorists , our military is helping to train Iraqi security forces so that they can defend their people and fight the enemy on their own . \nOur strategy can be summed up this way : As the Iraqis stand up , we will stand down . \nWe have made progress but we have a lot more work to do . \nToday Iraqi security forces are at different levels of readiness . \nSome are capable of taking on the terrorists and insurgents by themselves . \nA larger number can plan and execute anti-terrorist operations with coalition support . \nThe rest are forming and not yet ready to participate fully in security operations . \nOur task is to make the Iraqi units fully capable and independent . \nWe are building up Iraqi security forces as quickly as possible , so they can assume the lead in defeating the terrorists and insurgents . \nOur coalition is devoting considerable resources and manpower to this critical task . \nThousands of coalition troops are involved in the training and equipping of Iraqi security forces . \nNato is establishing a military academy near Baghdad to train the next generation of Iraqi military leaders , and 17 nations are contributing troops to the Nato training mission . \nIraqi army and police are being trained by personnel from Italy , Germany , Ukraine , Turkey , Poland , Romania , Australia and the United Kingdom . \nToday dozens of nations are working toward a common objective : an Iraq that can defend itself , defeat its enemies and secure its freedom . \nTo further prepare Iraqi forces to fight the enemy on their own , we are taking three new steps : First , we are partnering coalition units with Iraqi units . \nThese coalition-Iraqi teams are conducting operations together in the field . \nThese combined operations are giving Iraqis a chance to experience how the most professional armed forces in the world operate in combat . \nSecond , we are embedding coalition `` transition teams '' inside Iraqi units . \nThese teams are made up of coalition officers and noncommissioned officers who live , work and fight together with their Iraqi comrades . \nUnder US command , they are providing battlefield advice and assistance to Iraqi forces during combat operations . \nBetween battles , they are assisting the Iraqis with important skills such as urban combat and intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance techniques . \nThird , we are working with the Iraqi Ministries of Interior and Defense to improve their capabilities to coordinate anti-terrorist operations . \nWe are helping them develop command and control structures . \nWe are also providing them with civilian and military leadership training , so Iraq 's new leaders can more effectively manage their forces in the fight against terror . \nThe new Iraqi security forces are proving their courage every day . \nMore than 2,000 members of the Iraqi security forces have given their lives in the line of duty . \nThousands more have stepped forward and are now in training to serve their nation . \nWith each engagement , Iraqi soldiers grow more battle-hardened and their officers grow more experienced . \nWe have learned that Iraqis are courageous and that they need additional skills . \nThat is why a major part of our mission is to train them so they can do the fighting and our troops can come home . \nI recognize that Americans want our troops to come home as quickly as possible . \nSo do I. Some contend that we should set a deadline for withdrawing US forces . \nLet me explain why that would be a serious mistake . \nSetting an artificial timetable would send the wrong message to the Iraqis , who need to know that America will not leave before the job is done . \nIt would send the wrong message to our troops , who need to know that we are serious about completing the mission they are risking their lives to achieve . \nAnd it would send the wrong message to the enemy , who would know that all they have to do is to wait us out . \nWe will stay in Iraq as long as we are needed and not a day longer . \nSome Americans ask me , if completing the mission is so important , why do n't you send more troops ? \nIf our commanders on the ground say we need more troops , I will send them . \nBut our commanders tell me they have the number of troops they need to do their job . \nSending more Americans would undermine our strategy of encouraging Iraqis to take the lead in this fight . \nAnd sending more Americans would suggest that we intend to stay forever , when we are in fact working for the day when Iraq can defend itself and we can leave . \nAs we determine the right force level , our troops can know that I will continue to be guided by the advice that matters : the sober judgement of our military leaders . \nThe other critical element of our strategy is to help ensure that the hopes Iraqis expressed at the polls in January are translated into a secure democracy . \nThe Iraqi people are emerging from decades of tyranny and oppression . \nUnder the regime of Saddam Hussein , the Shia and Kurds were brutally oppressed and the vast majority of Sunni Arabs were also denied their basic rights , while senior regime officials enjoyed the privileges of unchecked power . \nThe challenge facing Iraqis today is to put this past behind them and come together to build a new Iraq that includes all its people . \nThey are doing that by building the institutions of a free society , a society based on freedom of speech , freedom of assembly , freedom of religion and equal justice under law . \nThe Iraqis have held free elections and established a transitional national assembly . \nThe next step is to write a good constitution that enshrines these freedoms in permanent law . \nThe assembly plans to expand its constitutional drafting committee to include more Sunni Arabs . \nMany Sunnis who opposed the January elections are now taking part in the democratic process , and that is essential to Iraq 's future . \nAfter a constitution is written , the Iraqi people will have a chance to vote on it . \nIf approved , Iraqis will go to the polls again to elect a new government under their new , permanent constitution . \nBy taking these critical steps and meeting their deadlines , Iraqis will bind their multiethnic society together in a democracy that respects the will of the majority and protects minority rights . \nAs Iraqis grow confident that the democratic progress they are making is real and permanent , more will join the political process . \nAnd as Iraqis see that their military can protect them , more will step forward with vital intelligence to help defeat the enemies of a free Iraq . \nThe combination of political and military reform will lay a solid foundation for a free and stable Iraq . \nAs Iraqis make progress toward a free society , the effects are being felt beyond Iraq 's borders . \nBefore our coalition liberated Iraq , Libya was secretly pursuing nuclear weapons . \nToday the leader of Libya has given up his chemical and nuclear weapons programs . \nAcross the broader Middle East , people are claiming their freedom . \nIn the last few months , we have witnessed elections in the Palestinian territories and Lebanon . \nThese elections are inspiring democratic reformers in places like Egypt and Saudi Arabia . \nOur strategy to defend ourselves and spread freedom is working . \nThe rise of freedom in this vital region will eliminate the conditions that feed radicalism and ideologies of murder and make our nation safer . \nWe have more work to do , and there will be tough moments that test America 's resolve . \nWe are fighting against men with blind hatred and armed with lethal weapons who are capable of any atrocity . \nThey wear no uniform ; they respect no laws of warfare or morality . \nThey take innocent lives to create chaos for the cameras . \nThey are trying to shake our will in Iraq just as they tried to shake our will on September 11 2001 . \nThe terrorists do not understand America . \nThe American people do not falter under threat and we will not allow our future to be determined by car bombers and assassins . \nAmerica and our friends are in a conflict that demands much of us . \nIt demands the courage of our fighting men and women , it demands the steadfastness of our allies and it demands the perseverance of our citizens . \nWe accept these burdens because we know what is at stake . \nWe fight today because Iraq now carries the hope of freedom in a vital region of the world , and the rise of democracy will be the ultimate triumph over radicalism and terror . \nAnd we fight today because terrorists want to attack our country and kill our citizens , and Iraq is where they are making their stand . \nSo we will fight them there , we will fight them across the world and we will stay in the fight until the fight is won . \nAmerica has done difficult work before . \nFrom our desperate fight for independence , to the darkest days of a Civil War , to the hard-fought battles against tyranny in the 20th century , there were many chances to lose our heart , our nerve or our way . \nBut Americans have always held firm , because we have always believed in certain truths . \nWe know that if evil is not confronted , it gains in strength and audacity and returns to strike us again . \nWe know that when the work is hard , the proper response is not retreat , it is courage . \nAnd we know that this great ideal of human freedom is entrusted to us in a special way and that the ideal of liberty is worth defending . \nIn this time of testing , our troops can know : The American people are behind you . \nNext week , our nation has an opportunity to make sure that support is felt by every soldier , sailor , airman , Coast Guardsman and Marine at every outpost across the world . \nThis Fourth of July , I ask you to find a way to thank the men and women defending our freedom by flying the flag , sending letters to our troops in the field or helping the military family down the street . \nThe Department of Defense has set up a website , AmericaSupportsYou . \nYou can go there to learn about private efforts in your own community . \nAt this time when we celebrate our freedom , let us stand with the men and women who defend us all . \nTo the soldiers in this hall , and our servicemen and women across the globe : I thank you for your courage under fire and your service to our nation . \nI thank our military families ; the burden of war falls especially hard on you . \nIn this war , we have lost good men and women who left our shores to defend freedom and did not live to make the journey home . \nI have met with families grieving the loss of loved ones who were taken from us too soon . \nI have been inspired by their strength in the face of such great loss . \nWe pray for the families . \nAnd the best way to honor the lives that have been given in this struggle is to complete the mission . \nI thank those of you who have re-enlisted in an hour when your country needs you . \nAnd to those watching tonight who are considering a military career , there is no higher calling than service in our Armed Forces . \nWe live in freedom because every generation has produced patriots willing to serve a cause greater than themselves . \nThose who serve today are taking their rightful place among the greatest generations that have worn our nation 's uniform . \nWhen the history of this period is written , the liberation of Afghanistan and the liberation of Iraq will be remembered as great turning points in the story of freedom . \nAfter September 11 2001 , I told the American people that the road ahead would be difficult and that we would prevail . \nWell , it has been difficult . \nAnd we are prevailing . \nOur enemies are brutal , but they are no match for the United States of America and they are no match for the men and women of the United States military . \nAnd may God bless America . \n"}

'' \nMr Bush was attempting to reverse a growing slump in public support for the war . \nTwo polls yesterday showed greater scepticism than ever . \nOnly one in three Americans believe the US and its allies are winning the war , down nine percentage points since February , according to a Gallup poll . \n"}

'' \nA lovely image , though highly romanticised . \nWe agnostics see only a fox running in terror for its life . \nTo the non-believer , the pleasures of Clayton 's book are incidental , not least the portraits of the glorious eccentrics who people hunting - figures such as the `` redoubtable '' -LRB- for which read terrifying -RRB- Daphne Moore , spinster , authority on hound pedigrees and author of The Book of the Foxhound , who used to follow the Beaufort on `` a large black ladies ' bicycle of ancient vintage '' . \nThere are also occasional startling facts . \nDid you know that Soho is named after a Norman hunting cry -LRB- `` So Ho '' -RRB- ? \nClayton is also interesting on hunting dress . \nThe author photograph on the flap shows him wearing the traditional top hat to hunt , but in the text he admits to having swapped it for a hard hat that offers more protection . \nTraditionalists still swear by toppers , even though they are hopeless if you fall . \n-LRB- The class warriors have never grasped that hunting performs the invaluable service of thinning out the ranks of the upper class . -RRB- \nRiding macs are also frowned on , hunters preferring to be tastefully soaked rather than dourly -LRB- but pragmatically -RRB- clad . \nIt is surely significant that Baily 's -LRB- the annual `` hunting bible '' -RRB- begins each of its entries on individual hunts with a description of their uniform : `` Dress : red , light blue facings , hunt buttons '' for the Quorn ; `` Blue coat , blue collar , buff facings '' for the Beaufort , which also specifies that hunt servants ' livery should be green . \nI have only hunted once -LRB- entirely for journalistic purposes -RRB- and went out with the Beaufort wearing a padded green jacket and jockey 's hat . \nExactly what he expected someone from the Guardian to be wearing , remarked the philosopher , hunting devotee and Beaufort subscriber Roger Scruton sardonically . \nBaily 's is in its 98th year . \nPresumably , it will make 100 , but how many of the packs of foxhounds , harriers , beagles , basset hounds , mink hounds , staghounds and bloodhounds will still exist in two years ? \nSimon Hart , chief executive of the Countryside Alliance , who contributes an article to Baily 's on the way ahead , makes no predictions about hunting 's survival . \nInstead , he argues that the debate , by becoming enmeshed in a grander `` whose country ? '' \nnarrative , has ceased to be about the specifics of hunting . \n`` To some backbenchers it is ` payback time for the miners ' , '' he complains , `` for others a matter of warped parliamentary principle or priority , and to some simply an issue about managing the Labor party . '' \nClayton refuses to accept that 2005 will mark the end of the activity to which he has devoted a large part of his life , yet he offers no coherent picture of how it will endure . \nWill hunts break the law , try to tie it in knots , or bed down and hope that one day the Tories return to power with sufficient numbers - and sufficient will - to reverse the ban ? \nThe dogs are going to need more than doggerel . \n"}
{"id": "249", "time": "2005-02-26", "text": "From Surrey to Basra , abuse is a fact of British army life Officers who blame ' a few bad apples ' ignore a culture of brutalisation Saturday 26 February 2005 02.13 GMT Stanley Kubrick 's film Full Metal Jacket must rank as one of the grimmest portrayals of the Vietnam war . \nA leading character , dubbed `` Joker '' , is asked why he volunteered ; he replies : '' -LRB- I -RRB- wanted to meet interesting , stimulating people from an ancient land ... and kill them . '' \nConfronted with the harrowing photographic evidence of abuse by British soldiers in Iraq , it is tempting to add the phrase `` humiliate , sexually abuse , and torture '' to this admission . \nWe seem to have moved a long way from the promise of restoring democracy to the Iraqi people . \nPart of the war has been conducted at a court martial in the ancient German city of Osnabruck , where two soldiers of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers have been found guilty of abusing civilian prisoners . \nA third soldier had already pleaded guilty to assault , after he was photographed standing on an Iraqi prisoner . \nIt is not only these men who stood trial , but the British army itself . \nAnd for many people around the world , the British people also bear some responsibility . \nEven before these convictions , the militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi , who has been linked to al-Qaida , claimed that suicide attacks were `` in response to the harm inflicted by British occupation forces on our brothers in prison '' . \nGiven our army 's record of abuse and torture in Malaya , Kenya , Aden , Cyprus , and Northern Ireland -LRB- to name just a few -RRB- , is it any wonder that many people might react cynically to claims that justice has been done ? \nThe evidence of abuse on British army premises in Iraq that was revealed during the trial indicates that something is seriously wrong with our armed forces . \nRituals involving physical and psychological humiliation , as well as sexual abuse , are not confined to overseas operations , but are also present `` at home '' . \nA survey carried out by the Ministry of Defense in 2002 found that more than 40 % of British soldiers believed the army had a problem with bullying , sexual discrimination and harassment . \nMore recently , an official study claims that almost half the women serving in the RAF have been sexually harassed at some point in their career . \nAnd only yesterday , the Sun published photographs of members of the Queen 's Guard apparently ritually humiliating a new recruit by tying him naked to a fence and pouring what appears to be manure over his head . \nIn addition , the claims of ritual humiliation and sexual abuse at Deepcut training camp , in Surrey , are profoundly disturbing . \nA police report into the barracks contained more than 100 allegations of serious abuse . \nThe fact that the army was aware of the repeated violent , predatory behavior of men such as Lance Corporal Leslie Skinner -LRB- convicted in 2004 of a series of sexual attacks on young recruits -RRB- and Lance Corporal David Atkinson -LRB- who murdered Cambridge student Sally Geeson on New Year 's Day -RRB- , is another indictment of the institution . \nThe army insists that these are aberrations - a few `` bad apples '' . \nBut it is plausible to assume that bullying and abuse are more widespread than senior officers wish to admit . \nWithin the barracks , a culture of silence prevails . \nLeslie Skinner 's victims , for instance , said nothing for years . \nThe reason for their reticence was that Skinner was `` rank '' and in the army `` you do what you are told '' . \nUnquestioning obedience is inculcated into every recruit . \nBasic training , from the donning of a uniform to being subjected to a relentless series of drills and chants , induces a lessening of self-awareness . \nSuch a process of de-individuation can lead to the weakening of restraints against prohibited forms of behavior . \nThis is coupled with the fact that positive military values include aggression , dominance and overt displays of physical prowess . \nSensitivity , understanding and compassion are routinely derided . \nThe `` macho '' culture in training barracks is shared by female soldiers too , many of whom become obsessed with the need to trounce the boys . \nAnd despite their enthusiasm , `` GI Janes '' often become targets of abuse . \nDuring the Gulf war , much was made of the fact that two US servicewomen taken prisoner had been raped . \nWhat was less publicised was that 24 US servicewomen reported being raped or sexually assaulted by colleagues during the withdrawal of forces . \nSimilarly , 29 % of American women who served in Vietnam were victims of actual or attempted sexual assault . \nClearly , ethical and moral codes change in the conditions of military life . \nThese altered standards , together with isolation from family and civilian networks , favor brutalisation . \nSo , too , does the general ambience of preparing for war . \nIn the Falklands war of 1982 , for instance , British soldiers on troop ships were shown violent pornographic films as a way of stimulating their aggression prior to battle . \nYoung male recruits in particular were terrified of being derided as `` queer '' and `` chicken '' . \nThose who refused to participate in `` raggings '' or group abuse were regarded as lacking loyalty . \nOstracism was dreaded : it denied recruits what little comfort could be grasped in an often alienating environment . \nAs one soldier put it , it was `` dangerous enough just fighting the acknowledged enemy '' . \nIn the front line , of course , both abuse and fear of reporting abuse increase exponentially . \nThe British army prides itself on its professionalism and its discipline . \nIts adherence to codes of honorable behavior in battle is central to the way the British army markets itself , particularly in opposition to other fighting forces -LRB- such as the Germans during the two world wars , and the Americans in the current conflict -RRB- . \nBut this image may be exploded as a result of the war in Iraq . \nIn all armies , the horror of battle can reduce inhibitions to atrocious behavior . \nBut this seems to be more likely on some battlefields than others . \nDuring the second world war , for example , British and American servicemen were significantly more likely to act in atrocious ways in the Pacific theater of war compared with the European one . \nThe guerrilla nature of warfare in the Pacific partly explained the greater willingness of soldiers to hit out blindly against enemy combatants and civilians alike . \nBut racism also played a significant part . \nAs drill instructors told recruits : `` You 're not going to Europe , you 're going to the Pacific . \nDo n't hesitate to fight the Japs dirty . '' \nClassifying the Japanese as inhuman meant they all became fair game . \nIn Iraq , too , it is hard to avoid the conclusion that racial and religious differences are fuelling much of the abuse being carried out by the occupying forces . \nRefusing to participate in abuses , as well as reporting maltreatment , becomes extremely difficult in such contexts . \nAlthough servicemen and women are only required to obey lawful orders , immediate and total obedience is deeply ingrained . \nAs one sergeant recalled after witnessing an atrocity in Vietnam : `` There was no chance of ever having anything done , and I ... did n't want to get hassled or thrown into the brig ...

{"id": "52", "time": "2005-05-31", "text": "Her new book about the quiet triumphs of the protest movement is designed to cheer up the left . \nHas Californian Rebecca Solnit spent too much time in the sun , or does she really offer a new way of looking at radical politics ? \nShe talks to Stuart Jeffries Rebecca Solnit is content with her life , thank you very much . \nShe is an anarchist activist and , by her own admission , an impecunious author . \nAs a writer she resembles Naomi Klein , though probably more radical , and also Susan Sontag , though somewhat less of an aesthete . \nSolnit lives in a rent-controlled apartment in San Francisco , has no dependents and no nine-to-five job to get in the way of regular visits from the literary muse . \nThat said , she says she may yet have children , but she enjoys her student-like existence too much to get tied down just yet . \n`` I decided to stop working in my editorial job in 1988 and that year has n't ended yet . \nLiving below one 's means can give you a sense of freedom . '' \nWhich is perhaps not something she should say too often outside the boho milieu of a literary festival . \nSurely then , I suggest , nobody should buy her new book - if we did , it would ruin her unimpeachably radical lifestyle ? \nShe would probably wind up spending the proceeds on 4x4s , Ikea kitchens and Big Macs . \n`` No , people should buy my book , '' says Solnit , rather sternly . \n`` I 'll have no income in 2006 otherwise . \nI need clean socks . '' \nThat book is called Hope in the Dark : The Untold History of People Power . \nIt has been hailed by George Monbiot and Tony Benn , and joins two impressive books , Wanderlust : A History of Walking , and Motion Studies : Time , Space and Eadweard Muybridge , in an odd , offbeat , appealingly off-message oeuvre . \nIf you were to put the new book 's philosophy on a placard , it would read : `` Oi ! \nYes , the Iraq war had hideous consequences , but do n't forget that anti-war protests may well have stopped Bush from unleashing an even more terrible bombing of Baghdad than he did . \nWhat about Latin America , where dictators have been falling like ninepins ? \nGays , women and blacks have all substantially overcome oppression ! \nTrue , that would make it a huge placard , but Solnit 's message is a complicated , counter - intuitive one . \nShe was inspired to write Hope in the Dark following the gloom that descended over the left in the US and UK after the anti-Iraq war demonstrations in February 2003 . \nOur governments seemed to ignore popular protest , democracy seemed dead , despair the only rational political option . \nSolnit argues that it is a luxury to collapse into despair . \nShe writes : `` To say that everything without exception is going straight to hell is not an alternative vision but only an inversion of the mainstream 's ` everything 's fine ' . '' \nShe recalls the human rights activist and Irish nationalist Roger Casement who , when investigating torture and genocide in South America 's Putamayo rainforest , still found time to admire handsome local men and chase brilliantly colored local butterflies -LRB- or maybe it was the other way round -RRB- . \nFrom this , Solnit draws the following moral : `` Joy does n't betray but sustains activism . \nAnd when you face a politics that aspires to make you fearful , alienated and isolated , joy is a fine initial act of insurrection . '' \n`` I 'm a natural contrarian , '' she says , `` and a lot of what I felt contrary about was the griping and the finding fault that is so prevalent in some parts of the left . '' \nThe book starts with an unexpectedly jaunty epigraph from that seeming arch leftwing male miserabilist , Noam Chomsky : `` The world is pretty awful today , but it is far better than yesterday , not only with regard to unwillingness to tolerate aggression , but also in many other ways , which we now tend to take for granted . '' \nSolnit similarly says that she sees a nuanced moral world of greys . \n`` It is always simplistic to see things in black and white . '' \nIs n't she just a smug , middle-class white Californian with an upbeat , post-hippyish philosophy ? \n`` I 'm certainly middle-class , white and Californian . \nI am certainly not saying that terrible things have not happened in Iraq . \nBut what we forget are the things that did not happen - the wars , the diseases , the people who did n't die . '' \nIndeed , she says that she hopes to see George Bush indicted for war crimes during her lifetime . \n`` Or , more importantly , during his . '' \nBorn the same year the Berlin wall went up -LRB- 1961 -RRB- , Solnit concedes that she had a strange upbringing for an American . \n`` I was floating in a kind of Laputa like in Gulliver 's Travels . \nI lived among radicals . \nI had to go to Nevada to see a Republican . '' \nHer Jewish mother and her Irish Catholic father contributed to her embrace of alternative politics , but it was a radical , bohemian aunt - a woman who used to fight against logging companies - who proved especially inspirational . \nSolnit describes herself as a cultural historian , but she has never fitted into the straitjacket of academe . \nInstead , she has written books and lectured on a freelance basis about such subjects as the American landscape - how indigenous inhabitants were ousted from the land that became the Yosemite national park , how the US government a century later instigated nuclear tests in Nevada . \nShe often writes lyrically about these issues , describing , for instance , these two landscapes as serving as `` our national Eden and Armageddon '' . \nSolnit 's most popular book so far is her history of walking . \nBut it is hardly a straight history or travel volume ; rather , it examines how walking became a political act in a technological , suburbanised society and how pedestrians - Gandhi 's salt walk , Martin Luther King 's marches , French demos - changed the world in part by physically claiming the streets . \nShe insists on the joy of taking to the streets and engaging in communal activism , especially now , when we are encouraged to become discrete , passive consumers . \nShe has a chastening line in her new book in which she asks her readers to imagine the world as a theater . \n`` The acts of the powerful and the official occupy center stage . \nThe traditional versions of history , the conventional sources of news encourage us to fix our gaze on that stage . '' \nThe result , she says , is `` the too-common silence of those who settle for being audience and who pay the price of the drama '' . \nSolnit is in the UK to lend her support to protest at the looming G8 meeting at Gleneagles . \nBut she contends that local responses to global problems are at least as important as such gestures . \nFor instance , she points out that , even though the US has not ratified the Kyoto treaty , her city government enforces Kyoto-style emission standards . \nShe advocates what she calls `` post-oppositional activism '' . \nBut to some , in a globalised world , that is an inadequate response . \nI remind Solnit that during her talk the previous evening she had been taken to task for this . \nGo preach that white , western , patronising philosophy to the street-fighting Uzbeks or to Palestinians resisting the Israeli state . \nSuch was the question 's tenor . \n`` I really agree with you , '' Solnit told her accuser , post-oppositionally . \n`` I am not opposed to that kind of politics in those places . \nI just think in the world I inhabit , that stuff does n't work any more .

{"id": "294", "time": "2005-05-09", "text": "The prime minister must accept that most British people want the troops out of Iraq Monday 9 May 2005 00.00 BST Tony Blair insists British troops can not leave Iraq until Iraq 's own police and army can guarantee security . \nIt is , of course , the same argument that George Bush uses to justify keeping close to 150,000 US soldiers in the country . \nNever mind the fact that pulling foreign troops out would almost certainly improve Iraq 's security , since much of the violence is directed against the occupation . \nWithout the occupation , the insurgency would decline dramatically . \nLet us take Blair 's position at face value . \nHas he not noticed that in Basra and the other two south-eastern provinces where British forces are based the insurgency barely exists ? \nIt is true that another British soldier died last week in Amara , a traditionally difficult town , but Basra has been quiet for months . \nSuicide bombers are conspicuous by their absence . \nAttacks on British forces are rare , and fatalities even rarer . \nOn election day in January there was almost no violence . \nThe reasons are varied , the main one being that the Shia political groups which control Basra are taking the long view . \nThey form the backbone of Iraq 's new government in Baghdad and have no particular complaint with the current drift of Iraqi politics nationally . \nAlthough they are Islamists , the conservative stamp they have put on the city has not been opposed by the British . \nThe radical Shias around the cleric Moqtada al-Sadr who strongly denounce the occupation and have taken up arms against it are not as active in Basra as they are in Baghdad and the holy city of Najaf , which is closer to the capital . \nSo , although there are special factors which explain it , the bottom line is that Iraq 's south-east has no real insurgency to speak of . \nWhy then are British troops needed ? \nWhat is the threat they are allegedly deterring , and that Iraqis can not handle on their own ? \nForget the cliches about `` not cutting and running '' . \nCut the rhetoric about `` the need to finish the job '' . \nBritish troops could pull out immediately , and neither the people of Iraq 's south-east nor the people of Britain would regret it . \nBush would not be pleased , but the American president has had to accept that other once-staunch allies have changed their minds and withdrawn their forces . \nSpain , the Netherlands and Poland have seen the light , under pressure from their own electorates . \nNow Blair should do the same . \nHow can we say we are trying to bring democracy to Iraq , he should tell the White House , and then not recognize democracy at home ? \nTen days before the general election an NOP poll showed that 60 % of Britons wanted British troops out by the end of this year . \nLast week 's slashing of the Labor parliamentary majority reinforced that view . \nBy accepting that most British people want out of Iraq , and telling Bush we can not remain there purely out of solidarity with the Americans , Blair could go a long way towards restoring the public trust he has lost during the past two and a half years . \nIt would not completely erase the effect of Iraq on his premiership -LRB- nothing will -RRB- , but it would at least be a sign that he understands how unpopular his policies over Iraq have been . \nBlair will never admit he was wrong on Iraq , let alone that he lied . \nBut by bringing his policies into line with the majority of British people , some of the taint of arrogance would be wiped away . \nIraq has been a kind of slow-motion Suez for Blair . \nLike Eden in 1956 , he took Britain to war in error , but whereas Eden was forced to resign within three months of his blunder , Blair will have taken four or five years to go . \nFor Eden it was more humiliating since what undid him was not the unpopularity of the war . \nThe Guardian and Observer opposed Suez , but most British people supported the invasion . \nIt was US opposition which undid Eden . \nWhen Eisenhower came out against the invasion of Egypt , Eden had no choice but to take the blame . \nBlair 's circumstances are different . \nThere was no majority for the war before it started , and apart from a few weeks while the invasion was under way , there has been no such support since . \nUltimately , it is a matter of courage . \nHas Blair the guts to tell Bush that he can not stand beside him any longer on a war which is unpopular in Britain ? \nBritish troops have been in occupation in Basra for more than two years . \nTheir job is done . \nThey should leave now . \n"}
{"id": "229", "time": "2005-05-09", "text": "Monday 9 May 2005 00.00 BST In June 1971 , Colonel David Hackworth , probably America 's most decorated soldier in Vietnam , appeared on ABC television and told his countrymen that the war could not be won , that US military leaders had failed to understand or train their men for the nature of the country or the conflict , that Saigon would fall to the communists within five years and that one of every five American casualties had been the victim of so-called friendly fire . \nThis criticism put Hackworth , who has died of cancer aged 73 , under concerted attack from his superiors , an assault made easier to sustain by the fast and loose approach to regulations he had employed as commander of a Blackhawk air cavalry brigade in Vietnam . \nHis troops wore US civil war hats , and Hackworth , as commander of the unit , later became the model for Colonel Kilgore , the abrasive , cigar-chomping officer played by Robert Duvall in the 1979 film Apocalypse Now . \nHackworth had set up his unit 's own bordello in Vietnam , and the US army used that and other violations to threaten him with court-martial . \nHowever , General Creighton Abrams , the overall commander in Vietnam , called him `` the best battalion commander I ever saw '' , and , in 1971 , he was allowed to resign with an honorable discharge . \nHe threw away his medals in protest , and moved to Australia . \nIn the 1980s , Hackworth returned to the US after his medals were reissued , and his book about Vietnam , About Face , became a best-seller . \nFrom 1990 to 1996 , he was a contributing editor on defense at Newsweek magazine , where , in 1996 , he wrote a column revealing that Admiral Michael Boorda , a former chief of US naval operations , wore combat medals he had not earned . \nWhen the admiral committed suicide , Hackworth again incurred the military 's wrath . \nHe was accused of lying when he claimed to be the army 's `` most-decorated soldier '' - the US keeps no statistics on such matters - and of wearing an unearned Ranger tab . \nAn army investigation found that Hackworth had been issued the tag in error , but had never been given a number of medals he had earned . \nHis decorations included two distinguished service crosses , the second highest US award for valor , 10 silver stars , eight bronze stars and eight purple hearts . \nAfter leaving Newsweek , Hackworth wrote a syndicated newspaper column , Defending America , with his third wife , Eilhys England . \nCovering both Iraq wars and peacekeeping actions in Somalia , the Balkans and Haiti , he became a fierce critic of the US establishment . \nHis website , Soldiers For Truth , lambasted the Pentagon 's `` perfumed princes '' , whom he claimed constantly betrayed the ordinary solider . \nHe was particularly incensed that Donald Rumsfeld used a machine to sign condolence letters sent to the families of dead soldiers in Iraq . \nHackworth 's army connections began young . \nOrphaned at five months , and raised by his grandmother in Santa Monica , California , he shined shoes at a local army base , becoming a mascot to the soldiers , who gave him his own uniform . \nAt 14 , he lied about his age and joined the US merchant marine ; a year later , he paid a sailor to impersonate his father and get him into the army , where he served in postwar Italy , policing the border dispute over Trieste . \nHe won his first silver Star in Korea at the age of 20 , when his battlefield commission made him the army 's youngest captain . \nCommanding the Wolfhound Raiders , he led one attack despite being shot in the head , modelling himself on General James Gavin , America 's youngest second world war general -LRB- played by Ryan O'Neal in the 1977 film , A Bridge Too Far -RRB- . \nHackworth volunteered for service with the US special forces in Vietnam , and , as the army 's youngest full colonel , returned in 1965 , commanding a paratroop unit . \nWith General SLA `` Slam '' Marshall , he wrote the Vietnam Primer , a guide to counter-guerrilla tactics . \nHe used his theories about the enemy , whom he referred to as `` the G '' , to transform a hapless 4\\/39 infantry unit into what became known as the Hardcore Battalion , driving his men so hard they allegedly put a cash bounty on him . \nBut he also won their loyalty , by such acts as leading the rescue of a trapped company while riding on the strut of a helicopter . \nIt was one of three times on which Hackworth was nominated for the congressional medal of honor , America 's highest award . \nAfter leaving the army , he was successful in property and restaurants in Brisbane , and became active in the Australian peace movement . \nHe returned to Greenwich , Connecticut , in the 1980s . \nHackworth 's many books included a novel , Price Of Honor , a volume of war dispatches , Hazardous Duty , and a memoir of the hardcore battalion , Steel My Soldier 's Hearts . \nServing soldiers fed his website with information about the army 's leadership shortcomings . \nLast February , he wrote , `` Most combat vets pick their fights carefully . \nThey look at their scars , remember the madness and are always mindful of the fallout ... the White House and the Pentagon are run by civilians who have never sweated it out on a battlefield .

'' \nMr Bush said the lesson of post-war European history was that rivals could become partners and that Washington supported a strong and united Europe `` because we need a strong partner in the hard work of advancing freedom in the world '' . \nHe said the US and western Europe shared a history of fighting tyranny in the second world war and in the democratisation of central and eastern Europe in the years after 1989 and the two needed to begin `` a new era of transatlantic unity '' . \nMr Bush will meet with the three key opponents of the Iraq war - the French , German , and Russian leaders , Jacques Chirac , Gerhard Schrder and Vladimir Putin - on his five day visit to Belgium , Germany and Slovakia . \nHe may have strong words for Mr Putin , whom he today urged to ensure Russia stayed true to democratic principles and the rule of law . \nHe said the EU must put democratic reform at the heart of its dialogue with Russia . \nIn a move sure to please Mr Bush , EU foreign ministers are today expected to approve the funding of a Baghdad office to coordinate the training of Iraqi judges and prosecutors . \nUS aides expressed hope that Mr Bush 's European visit would lead to a cooler transatlantic dialogue . \nHe will dine later today with Mr Chirac , one of his most outspoken critics on the Iraq war . \nThe EU may be cooperating with the US on Iraq but divisions remain over how to confront Iran about its nuclear programs and an EU proposal to end a 15-year arms embargo on China . \nMr Bush 's trip will see the tightest and largest security operation ever mounted in the countries he is visiting . \nSeveral thousand police were on duty in Brussels last night , almost double the quota deployed during EU summits , as hundreds of demonstrators staged the first of several planned protests . \n"}
{"id": "251", "time": "2005-01-06", "text": "` These are the people we never see on TV ' A new film reveals how the war hit a corner of Iraq the world had overlooked : Kurdistan . \nMichael Howard meets its director Turtles Can Fly : ` An anti-war movie without slogans . ' \nAs a Kurd , Bahman Gobadi knows that opportunity can grow out of tragedy . \nThat belief helps to explain why , two weeks after the fall of Saddam Hussein in the spring of 2003 , he slipped across the border from his native Iran and headed for Baghdad . \nWith him he carried a copy of his second feature film , Marooned in Iraq , a road movie about a group of Iranian-Kurdish musicians seeking lost love in Saddam 's benighted land . \nTurtles Can Fly -LRB- Lakposhtha Ham Parvaz Mikonand -RRB- `` I wanted to be the first to screen a film in Baghdad after the removal of the great dictator , '' he said last week in Arbil , the main Iraqi Kurdish city . \n`` Being caught watching such a movie under the former regime would have almost certainly meant death . \nI was so delighted that Saddam had gone . '' \nBut Gobadi had also packed a small video camera , which whirred away as he passed through scores of impoverished Kurdish villages en route to the capital . \nBack in Tehran after the screening , he looked at the footage . \n`` What I saw was startling : a land full of mines and refugee tents and disabled children ... arms sellers , abandoned tanks , mortars . '' \nHe could n't sleep . \n`` Every time I closed my eyes , I was haunted by those images . \nThere was something telling me to go back and make another movie . \nSo I smuggled myself back over the border and started work . '' \nThis was the beginning of Turtles Can Fly , the first feature film to emerge from post-Saddam Iraq . \nIt is a powerful cry on behalf of children everywhere caught up in despotism and war . \nFilmed on location last winter , using minimal equipment in the mountainous terrain of Iraqi Kurdistan , Turtles paints a radically different picture of life in Iraq from the one most western audiences have seen on their news channels . \nGobadi is a deeply political film-maker , but his nuanced approach skillfully avoids the naive blustering of many on the anti-war left . \n`` It is an anti-war movie without slogans . '' \nHe chose the title in part , he says , because `` people might think it was some kind of Disney film '' . \nAs with A Time for Drunken Horses , his acclaimed first film , the central characters are children . \nThey are all first-time actors , some with serious physical disabilities , from whom Gobadi has coaxed astonishing performances . \nThe story follows a group of Iraqi Kurdish orphans in a refugee camp on the Turkish border on the eve of the US-led invasion . \nThe children carry the physical and mental scars of life under Saddam 's regime with stoicism and not a little humor . \nGobadi 's aim , he says , was to present a portrait of the `` pain and surrealism '' of war and its effects on Iraqis with `` naturalness and honesty '' . \n`` These are the people we never see or hear from on TV , '' he says . \n`` President Bush and Saddam had become the superstars on the satellite channels . \nIraqi people were just extras . \nSo I wanted my stars to be the children , with Saddam and Bush in the background . '' \nTurtles Can Fly is as bold a presentation of the Kurdish experience as has appeared on the big screen since the great Turkish Kurdish director Yilmaz Guney made Yol . \nAnd it has clearly touched a nerve among Iraq 's Kurds . \nA week after the film 's premiere in Arbil , Gobadi still bore the bruises from what he described as `` the astonishing reaction '' of the audience . \n`` They almost hugged me to death , '' he said . \n`` I was telling a part of their pain and their memories . \nI take it as a compliment . \nIf they had not believed what was in the film , they would not have reacted like that . '' \nIt is Gobadi 's biggest production to date , involving thousands of Kurdish villagers as extras , as well as real US soldiers and helicopters . \nAnd he admits that without the help of the Kurdish Regional Government , led by Nechirvan Barzani , the film would never have been made . \n`` We did n't have the money , or any sophisticated equipment , so their help made the difference . '' \nFilming was tough , he says . \n`` We endured hours of freezing weather , filming in the mud and the mountains . \nAnd believe me , what these children did in my film and put up with for my film , the Hollywood children could never do . \nThe children were acting their lives . \nThat 's why they seem so real . '' \nGobadi was born in 1969 in the border town of Baneh in Iranian Kurdistan . \nAs a student , he worked for a radio station before joining a group of amateur film-makers in the city Sanandaj . \nWith their help , he directed his first short films . \nIn Tehran , where he had moved to attend film classes -LRB- he dropped out before graduating -RRB- , Gobadi directed a number of award-winning short films . \nIn 1999 , he was Abbas Kiarostami 's first assistant on The Wind Will Carry Us , which proved a crucial stepping stone . \nFor Turtles he teamed up once more with cameraman Shahriar Assadi - `` He 's a Kurd at heart '' - and persuaded Hussein Alizadeh , one of Iran 's leading composers , to provide the eerily beautiful soundtrack . \nVariety magazine recently dubbed Gobadi `` the poet laureate of the Kurdish cinema '' . \nYet he dismisses talk of a Kurdish cinema as premature . \n`` When we have cinemas in every Kurdish town , and when Kurdish language and culture on film is no longer viewed as a rare and exotic bird by the film community , perhaps then we can talk of a Kurdish cinema . \nI want to register the Kurds on the cultural map . '' \nGobadi now lives in Tehran , because that is where the Iranian film industry is based . \n`` But it 's just my body that lives there , '' he says . \n`` My spirit and my heart are in Kurdistan . '' \nTurtles Can Fly is released tomorrow . \n"}
{"id": "291", "time": "2005-10-06", "text": "' I do give a damn ' After years of writing superior spy thrillers , author David Cornwell , aka John Le Carr , has evolved into an impassioned political commentator . \nThe film of his novel The Constant Gardener - which opens this year 's London film festival - is a searing indictment of Britain 's recent record in Africa . \nIn a rare interview , he talks to Stuart Jeffries about his ` radical period ' One day , perhaps , David Cornwell will write a book called A Strange Kind of Patriot . \nIt will make the narrative twists and turns of The Spy Who Came In from the Cold seem like plot devices for the Teletubbies . \nIts principal character will be someone who was a master at Eton , went on to become our man in Hamburg , served Her Majesty 's Secret Services -LRB- both MI5 and MI6 -RRB- , and who was exposed as a spy to the Soviets by the traitor Kim Philby . \nBut it will also be about a man who , when asked why he stays in this benighted country , replies : `` When Simon Wiesenthal was asked why he lived in Vienna , he said , ` If you want to study the disease , you live in the swamp . ' \nSo I live in the swamp . '' \nCornwell is , most likely , being histrionic . \nAfter all , Britain is not a swamp . \nYou ca n't , for instance , play cricket in swamps . \nAnd cricket is not a small matter to Cornwell , the man who has written 19 novels under the pen name John Le Carr . \nHe sweeps into the interview suite at a London hotel looking sartorially the very image of an MCC buffer , demanding to know the Test score after being confined for the past hour to a round-table grilling by continental journalists . \nThis is a patriot who tells me he could easily have defected if he had wanted to , though it would have deprived him of excursions to Lord 's to see England attempt to rout uppity ex-colonials . \nBut his patriotism only goes so far . \nIn a key scene in the new film adaptation of his novel The Constant Gardener , for instance , Britain and all it stands for gets rubbished . \nIn it a fey , eponymous and very English career diplomat called Justin Quayle -LRB- played by Ralph Fiennes -RRB- has just delivered a fatuous speech in which he has asserted that , `` Diplomacy is the map and measure of civilisation '' , only to be taken to task by a firebrand law student called Tessa -LRB- Rachel Weisz -RRB- , whom Cornwell describes in the novel as an `` angel waif with a cudgel '' and who will soon afterwards become Quayle 's wife . \n`` Whose map ? '' \nshe asks pointedly , implying that the British map of civilisation would be very different from , say , that of a country in the developing world . \nShe then launches into a rant against Britain and its presumption to have an ethical foreign policy while its armed forces are mired in Iraq , which she describes as `` Vietnam , the sequel '' . \n`` You are being paid to apologise for this pathetic country , Britain , '' she tells Quayle . \nHe folds under this assault but is more than a little turned on . \nCornwell did not write this dialogue . \nIt was a free adaptation by the screenwriter -LRB- the novelist Jeffrey Caine -RRB- , in which he updated their conversation . \nWhy did Cornwell not write the screenplay himself ? \n`` I was getting into another novel , so I was very glad not to be saddled with writing the script . '' \nBut were n't you uncomfortable about what Caine did to your story , especially the way he updated the exchange between Justin and Tessa ? \n`` Not at all . \nIt 's not smoke up your arse , but I was very happy with the adaptation of the film . '' \nI jump at this , partly because a potty mouth is not what one expects from this suave man , but also because it is unusual for Cornwell to feel other than mauled when his books hit the screen . \n`` I have been through the sheep dip with movies before but , like everybody else , I blame myself . \nI have written what I thought were very attractive books that have broken down badly for film . \nIf they were n't satisfactory movies , I was part of the process that made them unsatisfactory . \nI do n't feel that I was used or traduced , but many were n't very good . \nSome , though , were . \nThe film of The Spy Who Came In from the Cold was pretty good . \nTinker Tailor was really good . '' \nHe understandably forbears from naming those sheep-dip adaptations , but The Russia House , The Little Drummer Girl and The Tailor of Panama are surely contenders . \nAnd now , in Cornwell 's estimation , the adaptation of The Constant Gardener is really good , too . \nBut does that approbation extend to topical references inserted by his screenwriter to Britain 's role in the Iraq war ? \n`` Refitting the script was admissible , I thought , '' he says crisply . \nMore than admissible , surely . \nCaine has accurately reflected , in Tessa 's swingeing words , much of what Cornwell has said about the war on Iraq . \nSince the publication of The Constant Gardener , he has gone on record opposing the Anglo-American ousting of Saddam Hussein . \nHe told James Naughtie on BBC Radio 4 's Today program a couple of years ago that , `` To me there 's no bigger sin that a politician can commit than allowing his country to go to war under false pretences . '' \n`` Actually , '' says Cornwell , `` I believe the sin was greater than simply taking us to war . \nIt destroyed our relationship with the Middle East and with south-east Asia and took us on a flight of fantasy about our relationship with the US . \nThose are terrible sins . '' \nAnd those purported sins were committed by his nemesis , Tony Blair , a politician whose failings he once ascribed to his education , saying : `` I think that the extremely old-fashioned schools such as Fettes -LRB- in his day , anyway -RRB- leave marks of puritanism and deformation . '' \nFor the record , Cornwell believes Britain 's public schools should be abolished . \nFor the record , too , his dislike of them is a lifelong phenomenon - young David persuaded his father to send him to school in Switzerland after reportedly feigning a nervous breakdown at Sherborne school , which he detested . \nBut Cornwell 's rancor is now directed not just at Blair and the anti-egalitarian establishments that made him what he is . \n`` Our tragedy as a nation is bigger than Blair . \nBlair 's rise and rise is consonant with the collapse of the Conservative party and the leaderless condition of the Liberal party . \nI think it is becoming not just a social but a patriotic duty to attest to the shit that we are being subjected to . '' \nAgain with the jarring potty mouth . \nIt is worth asking if at any point he was tempted to defect from this pathetic country ? \n`` Well , I have had every chance of defecting from Britain for every reason - financial reasons or whatever . \nBut I 'm part of this . \nIt made me and ultimately I love it . '' \nIf , however , you read The Constant Gardener , it is hard to detect a man who loves his homeland . \nWidely hailed as his best novel for many years , it depicts the British high commission in Nairobi as working hand in glove with the most contemptible mutations of late capitalism , the international pharmaceutical industry . \nIt hardly makes one want to hoist the Union Jack . \nAnd even though the novel includes a postface in which he disclaims any indictment of the high commission , the sour taste remains that our men and women abroad are protecting British interests in a grubbily neo-colonial and unprincipled manner . \nFor them , the novel implies , it matters little if Africans die from taking a dodgy drug that has been improperly tested , so long as the pharmaceutical company developing it creates 1,500 jobs in Britain . \nCornwell finds such government collusion with corporations nauseating . \n`` Mussolini 's definition of fascism was that when you ca n't distinguish corporate power from governmental power , you are on the way to a fascist state . \nIf you throw in God power and media power , that 's where we are now . '' \nIs he saying Britain is a fascist state ? \n`` Does it strike you as democratic ? '' \nNone the less , Cornwell says : `` I 'm sorry to have portrayed the high commission in such miserable terms . \nThe fact is that they got into the line of fire because they have to enforce government policy . \nSo they became the whipping boys . \nI was having fun with a former colony , as I often do . \nBritish habits and postures are very comic . \nEvery foreign mission is slightly frozen in time . \nPeople are living at a level that they never could in Britain . \nIt 's the same whichever embassy you go to . \nAt the German embassy there 's a Bismarckian opulence . '' \nBut despite Cornwell 's depiction of Britain 's miserable diplomatic efforts in Kenya , the real target is the British government . \n`` Yes , I believe this movie is in the line of movies that should be made about political subjects . \nThere is an absence of opposition in parliament . \nThe concerns and information possessed by the man in the street are not expressed . \nThere is a truth gap that desperately needs to be filled . \nIn that sense , this is a useful movie . \nOf course there need to be others . '' \nBut is n't his book a fiction ? \n`` This is a kind of documentary . \nIt is a report which is fictional but incontrovertible in fact . '' \nHe argues that The Constant Gardener is also a useful movie because it indicts western pharmaceutical companies for their greed in trying to make profits by using the world 's most poor and vulnerable people as expendable . \n`` The multinational pharmaceutical world , once I entered it , got me by the throat and would n't let go . \nBig Pharma , as it is known , offered everything : the hopes and dreams we have of it ; its vast , partly realized potential for good ; and its pitch-dark underside , sustained by huge wealth , pathological secrecy , corruption and greed . '' \nIn The Constant Gardener we see poor Africans being given a drug called Dypraxa that tests for HIV . \nBut its recipients are unwittingly taking part in dubious clinical trials to find out whether the pills could also serve as a hugely profitable anti-tubercular wonder drug for rich westerners . \nAnd all with the connivance of a British government seeking to boost domestic employment , and an African government bribed to accept trials on their people . \n`` Our story is about human guinea pigs and the faking of clinical trials , '' he says . \nBut why would a pharmaceutical company fake trials ? \nCornwell snorts at my naivety . \nMost of them have bigger marketing than R&D budgets , '' he says . \n`` This happens a lot with big pharmas . '' \n`` Nothing that has happened in the years since I wrote that book has changed . \nSome things have got worse . \nThe posture , particularly of the American administration , is shameful . \nPharamaceuticals are priced for the American industry . '' \nCornwell was thrilled to have a Brazilian , Fernando Meirelles , director of the extraordinary Rio-slum-set City of God , at the helm of the film : `` Fernando brought to it a third-world view . \nFrom the moment he was aboard , the story was about the victim rather than the perspective I had in the novel . '' \nIn the novel , Tessa Quayle arrives newly married in Nairobi , where her husband is to take up a diplomatic post . \nInstead of becoming a diplomat 's complaisant wife , she becomes a campaigner against the big pharmas and submits a report to the high commission pointing out that Dypraxa is being tested on sick Africans for mercenary motives . \nThe foreign office hushes up the report in the name of trade . \nTessa is the story 's conscience , an irritant who stands against the grubby self-interest that lies behind western neo-colonialism . \nIn this , she bears considerable resemblance to Yvette Pierpaoli , the dynamic French aid worker who sought to help war widows , displaced persons , landmine victims , homeless families , street children and other refugees . \nCornwell has written eulogies to her work and dedicated The Constant Gardener to her : `` For Yvette Pierpaoli , who lived and died giving a damn . '' \nTessa , too , gives a damn , but only after her death does her husband realize the value of his dead wife 's passion for justice . \nTessa is murdered in a remote area of northern Kenya . \nHer traveling companion , a charismatic doctor , appears to have fled the scene , which seems to indicate that it may have been a crime of passion . \nCertainly the bereaved Quayle is encouraged to believe this . \nBut he does not : her traveling companion was gay and , in any case he starts to discover there are many more plausible motives for her murder . \nHigh commission drones , foreign office invertebrates , Kenyan officials and corporate thugs are keen to ensure he does not . \nTessa is killed on page one of the book and it is fundamental that the film follows its non-linear structure . \nCornwell has written a particularly affecting and unusual love story , about a bereaved husband falling more intensely in love with a woman whose true nature he scarcely realized during her life and whose work he realizes he must devote himself to continuing . \nThus the stories of political awakening to the evils of capitalism rampant and a poignantly observed posthumous romance are inseparable . \nThe Times described the novel as `` Le Carr with a new twist , the Old Master developing new techniques for a new age ... What is different in this book , however , is the passion . '' \nBelatedly , one might think , he has started to live like Pierpaoli , and to give a damn . \nAnd to write as if he did , too . \nHis latest novel after The Constant Gardener was 2003 's Absolute Friends , in which Smiley 's people - his favored dramatis personae of cold war double agents - were retooled as bitter old men seething over what they saw as the idiocy of Bush-Blair geopolitics . \nCornwell describes Absolute Friends as `` a piece of political science fiction '' aimed at showing `` what could happen if we allow present trends to continue to the point of absurdity where corporate media are absolutely at the beck and call in the United States of a neo-conservative group which is commanding the political high ground , calling the shots and appointing the state of Israel as the purpose of all Middle Eastern and practically all global policy '' . \nFor some , this was irksome : the Guardian lamented the novel 's strident editorialising . \nIts radical anti-American credentials were unimpeachable . \nIn the acknowledgments he thanked John Pilger for his `` words of wisdom over dinner '' , while anti-globalisation campaigners Naomi Klein , Joseph Stiglitz , Noam Chomsky and George Monbiot were name-checked in the text amid rhetorical denunciations of American neo-imperialism , of the Atlantic alliance and of Tony Blair for taking us into war with Iraq . \nThis led one critic to suggest that Cornwell had come up with new villains : in his old novels they were KGB spymasters ; now they are the people who defeated them . \nWhat prompted the 73-year-old to become so radical in his past two novels ? \nCornwell denies that it is a new departure . \n`` I think it was just a coming out . \nIf you look at the books from quite early on , none of them is satisfied with the status quo . \nThe Spy Who Came In from the Cold was locked in the ice of the cold war . \nThe other books - A Perfect Spy was very cheeky . \nThe Tailor of Panama - I do n't know if you would say that belongs to my radical period . '' \nIf he finds it hard to date his radical period , we can only speculate . \nPerhaps it began when , in the mid-80s , he turned down a new year 's honor from Margaret Thatcher and started to become sympathetic to the Arab world - a sympathy that led him into a rather unedifying public spat in 1997 in which he criticised Salman Rushdie for insulting Islam in the Satanic Verses , and Rushdie retorted that Cornwell supported the Islamists who wanted to murder him . \nCornwell 's Islamic sympathies have hardly diminished in the new millennium . \n`` We went through a terrible period when it was defined among neo-conservatives of Bush 's first administration that they would equate liberalism with pro-Islamism . \nThat was the absolute nadir of relations between the American government and the media . \nWhat Bush is doing can only happen with the complicity of an appalling corporate media , along with religious doctrine . \n`` I believe that when the history of this is told , what will be perceived as most awful is the collapse of the US media as a critical voice . '' \nWhat about the British media ? \n`` Once we were in there we were telling the same lies . \nThe spin doctors have done some gruesome things . \nThe price is we live in ignorance . '' \nAre these issues that will resurface in the next book ? \n`` I never talk about what I 'm working on . '' \nBut for such a writer who , since the millennium , has been unafraid to inject agitprop into his fiction , it seems unlikely he will be able to keep the politics out , nor cease to explore his loathing for his beloved homeland . \nThe Constant Gardener opens the London film festival on October 19 . \nIt goes on general realease on November 11 . \n"}
{"id": "95", "time": "2005-08-04", "text": "The July 7 attacks in London were not an individual act of terrorism but one episode in a worldwide conflict , say researchers at Oxford University . \nPhilip Ball reports Thursday 4 August 2005 00.02 BST The third world war has already started . \nIt is not George Bush 's rhetorical `` war on terror '' , but terrorism itself . \nIn other words , terrorism is the new war . \nA recent analysis of the casualty statistics of global terrorism shows they follow the pattern previously observed for conventional conflicts ranging from small local skirmishes to the second world war . \nIn at least two continuing conflicts not generally regarded as terrorist in nature - in Iraq and Colombia - the statistics are converging on the form seen for global terrorism , perhaps indicating that governments need to deal with wars differently . \nAccording to Neil Johnson , a physicist at Oxford University and one of the team that studied the figures , the findings raise the possibility that both conflicts `` are a part of one big ongoing global war - a mother of all wars '' . \nIf that is so , London is embroiled in it , too . \nThe casualty figures for the July 7 bombings `` absolutely fall in line '' with what the analysis of terrorism statistics predict , says Johnson . \nBut how can a single , simple -LRB- if gruesome -RRB- statistic such as the number of people killed in attacks tell us anything meaningful about events and conflicts conducted in completely different places for what seem to be totally different reasons ? \nIs n't this like expecting to understand a country 's culture by counting its population ? \nThat depends on what you are looking for . \nWhen he first studied the statistics of `` deadly quarrels '' 80 years ago , the British physicist Lewis Fry Richardson wanted to understand why wars happen . \nRichardson , a Quaker who served as an ambulance driver in the first world war , hoped that such insight could promote world peace . \nHe decided first to find out how wars were distributed according to their size . \nIn the 1920s , Richardson plotted the fatality statistics for 82 wars fought since 1820 on a graph showing the size of the conflicts on one axis and the number of conflicts of that size on the other . \nHe found that the data fitted onto a smooth curve which , when the numbers were plotted as logarithms , became a straight line . \nThis sort of mathematical relationship is known as a power law . \nThe line slopes `` downwards '' because there are progressively fewer conflicts of ever greater size : little wars are common ; big ones rare . \nThe power law continued to hold as the data embraced conflicts such as the second world war and Vietnam . \nRichardson 's discovery of power-law statistics of conflicts has been followed subsequently by the recognition that power laws govern all sorts of `` social '' statistics , from the sizes of towns to the fluctuations of economic markets and the network structure of the world wide web . \nPower-law statistics of event sizes are also found for natural phenomena that occur close to points of instability , such as earthquakes and avalanches . \nThis suggests that social systems prone to power-law statistics , such as economic markets and international relations , also operate on the brink of instability . \nEarlier this year , computer scientists Aaron Clauset and Maxwell Young at the University of New Mexico showed that the fatalities from acts of terrorism since 1968 also follow a power law . \n`` We were very surprised , '' Clauset says . \n`` It made us think that there may be some deep , underlying connection between terrorism and wars . '' \nBut they found that not all terrorism is the same . \nThere are two different power laws - one that fits the figures for terrorist attacks in industrialised -LRB- G8 -RRB- nations ; and another for attacks in the rest of the world . \nThe slope of the straight-line plot was steeper in the latter case , indicating that attacks in industrialised nations are more rare but more severe when they do occur . \nThe attacks of September 11 indicate precisely that , as do the London bombings . \nJohnson has teamed up with economist Mike Spagat at Royal Holloway College in London , a specialist in the Colombian conflict , and researchers in Bogot , Colombia , to apply the same kind of analysis to this continuing struggle between the government and several left - and rightwing insurgent groups . \nThe conflict has been going on since the 1980s , and at face value it resembles neither a terrorist-style confrontation nor a conventional war . \nBut the researchers found that the fatality statistics for individual attacks since 1989 also follow a power law . \nMore strikingly still , the slope of the power law has been decreasing steadily over time and appears to be converging on precisely the value that Clauset and Young found for global -LRB- non-G8 -RRB- terrorism . \nThe Colombian `` war '' may have started out as something unique , but it seems now to have mutated into a conflict with the fingerprint of terrorism . \nAnd the team found the same trend for the statistics in Iraq since the coalition invasion in March , 2003 . \nHere , the slope of the power law initially had much the same value as that seen by Richardson for conventional wars . \nBut it has crept up steadily since 2003 , and now it , too , is equal to that for global terrorism . \nJohnson argues that , while the conventional approach of political analysts is to look for micro-explanations of the course of a conflict in terms of the motivations of the groups concerned , that statistical analysis suggests that the outcomes are much more to do with `` the mechanics of how people now do war '' . \n`` It 's like looking at different markets , '' he says . \n`` We now know that a lot of the fluctuations are universal , irrespective of whether you 're looking at trading in New York or Shanghai . '' \nWith that in mind , he and his colleagues have developed a simple mathematical model of how insurgent forces are organised into small groups that are continually coalescing and fragmenting . \nAssuming that the destructive capacity of a group depends on its size and resources , this model predicts the value of the power-law slope found for global terrorism . \nThe team 's conclusion supports the assertion of Mary Kaldor , a political scientist at the London School of Economics , that `` the ongoing war in Iraq is a new type of war '' . \nKaldor says that US military action in Iraq has been predicated on the assumption that they are fighting an `` old war '' . \n`` This is immensely dangerous , '' Kaldor says . \nThat , it seems , must also be the message for any global `` war on terror '' - it is not one that can be won by military might , but by new strategies . \nIn `` new wars '' , says Kaldor , military forces should be deployed for law enforcement , and `` forces are needed that combine soldiers , police and civilians with the capacity to undertake humanitarian and legal activities '' . \nBut if , as Johnson 's work suggests , these conflicts have indeed turned into a form of terrorism , they will not be over soon . \nAccording to Clauset , the power-law statistics of terrorism show that it `` is an endemic feature of the modern world and is likely not something that can be completely eradicated . \nInstead , it should be considered in a similar way to other endemic problems , such as crime and natural disasters . '' \nFrom old wars to new wars and global terrorism N Johnson et al. . \n-LRB- - i think that 's unfair , he was a kid , no ? \nFor the paedo stuff he was a powerful adult . \n"}
{"id": "236", "time": "2005-08-04", "text": "Thursday 4 August 2005 09.32 BST Ayman al-Zawahri , al-Qaida 's second-in-command , speaks in a video aired by al-Jazeera in which he warned Britons that Tony Blair 's policies will bring more destruction to London . \nPhotograph : al-Jazeera\\/Reuters Osama bin Laden 's deputy blamed Tony Blair 's foreign policy for the London bomb attacks in a video broadcast today and warned of `` more destruction '' to come . \nAl-Qaida 's No 2 , Ayman al-Zawahiri , said the suicide bombings in London on July 7 , described as `` volcanoes of wrath '' , had followed the UK 's rejection of an offer of a `` truce '' from al-Qaida conditional on withdrawing troops from Iraq . \nIn a message broadcast this afternoon on the Qatar-based al-Jazeera television station , Zawahiri said : `` Blair 's policies will bring more destruction to Britons after the London explosions , God willing . '' \nDowning Street refused to make any immediate comment on the tape , which is the first message from al-Qaida 's inner circle to directly mention last month 's suicide bombings in which 52 people were murdered . \nTonight the US president , George Bush , said he would not be deterred by threats from Zawahiri , who warned that the US faced worse casualties in Iraq than in Vietnam . \nIn the immediate aftermath of the attacks , the prime minister denied the Iraq war was a factor . \nHe said later , after the foreign policy thinktank Chatham House linked Iraq with the attacks , that the war was `` an excuse '' , but argued that terrorists with an `` evil ideology '' would always find grievances to justify attacks . \nToday Zawahiri said that al-Qaida 's message was clear : `` You will not be safe until you withdraw from our land , stop stealing our oil and wealth and stop supporting the corrupt rulers . '' \nEgyptian-born Zawahiri did not claim responsibility for the London attacks but rather put the al-Qaida stamp of approval on them , which has increasingly become the new dynamic as the terror organization , deprived of its training camps in Afghanistan , changes in nature . \nAnalysts have said it is unlikely that the London bombings were directly organised by the al-Qaida leadership in a way that the September 11 attacks were . \nIt is thought that they were more likely to have been inspired by al-Qaida , in a similar way to last year 's Madrid bombings , which claimed 191 lives . \nThe July 7 attacks were carried out by four suicide bombers , three of whom lived in West Yorkshire . \nHowever there has been speculation that they could have been orchestrated by a `` mastermind '' who traveled to the country , recruited Britons and gave them training and help with explosives and fled before the attacks were carried out . \nExperts said it was probably no coincidence that the Zawahiri tape emerged on a Thursday , exactly four weeks on from the Thursday July 7 attacks and two weeks after the failed bomb attacks on Thursday July 21 . \nAs the tape was broadcast , around 6,000 police were out in force in a major London security operation today . \n-LRB- Read more here -RRB- Scotland Yard has warned of more attacks , although there is no specific intelligence anticipating an attack today and senior officers have said there is no hard evidence that a `` third cell '' that is still at large . \nThe Zawahiri tape is sure to be scrutinised by British anti-terror officers . \nIn it , Zawahiri refers to an audio tape broadcast by the al-Arabiya television station last April in which a speaker purported to be Bin Laden offered a ceasefire to nations deciding not to `` interfere '' in Muslim countries . \nThe offer was not extended to the US . \nIn today 's tape , Zawahiri says : `` As to the nations of the crusader alliance , we have offered you a truce if you leave the land of Islam . \nHas n't Sheik Osama bin Laden told you that you will not dream of security before there is security in Palestine and before all the infidel armies withdraw from the land of Mohammed ? \nInstead , you spilled blood like rivers in our countries , and we exploded the volcanoes of wrath in your countries . '' \nZawahiri also warned the US that `` tens of thousands '' of its military personnel would die if they did not immediately withdraw from Iraq and that continuation of US aggression against Muslims would make `` you forget the horrible things in Vietnam and Afghanistan '' . \nThe footage showed Zawahiri wearing white robes , with an AK47 assault rifle by his side . \nBehind him was a muddy brown sackcloth of a kind often used in al-Qaida tapes to hide geographical features that could provide clues to where they were filmed . \nLivingstone calls for Iraq pullout Zawahiri 's comments are sure to rekindle debate about how involvement in Iraq has endangered the UK . \nIn today 's Guardian newspaper , the mayor of London , Ken Livingstone , argued that British troops should be withdrawn from Iraq to help protect the city from more attacks , because the invasion was `` not justified '' . \nZawahiri is a former eye doctor who merged his militant group with al-Qaida in Afghanistan in the late 90s . \nLike Bin Laden , he has a $ 25m bounty on his head and some experts regard him as the prime force behind al-Qaida 's ideology . \nHe last appeared in a video aired by al-Jazeera in June , in which he called for an armed struggle to expel `` crusader forces and Jews '' from Muslim states and said that peaceful change was impossible . \nThe last videotape from Bin Laden emerged on October 29 last year ahead of the US elections on November 2 . \nIn it he threatened another attack like September 11 and said : `` Bush is still deceiving you ... and therefore the reasons are still there to repeat what happened '' . \nSome UK and US officials have expressed anxieties about the media broadcasting messages from al-Qaida . \nBin Laden and Zawahiri are suspected to be hiding somewhere around the Afghanistan-Pakistan border are the subject of a manhunt on a huge scale that has so far proved fruitless . \nSuspect has Italian court date set In other developments today , an extradition hearing has been set for August 17 in Rome for Hussein Osman , one of the chief suspects in July 21 attacks , who was arrested in the Italian capital last week . \n-LRB- Read more here -RRB- Ray Kelly , the New York police commissioner , is likely to have caused more consternation in Scotland Yard after disclosing new details about the July 7 investigation , a week after the Met appealed to international agencies to be discrete with shared information . \nMr Kelly said the bombs were probably detonated using mobile phones and the explosives included hair bleach . \nScotland Yard refused to comment . \n-LRB- Read more here -RRB- Letters for publication should be sent to : letters@guardian.co.uk If you need help using the site : userhelp@guardian.co.uk Call the main Guardian and Observer switchboard : This article was published on guardian . \n"}

{"id": "110", "time": "2005-07-18", "text": "Thinktank says war boosts al-Qaida Britain 's involvement in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan contributed to the terrorist attacks in London , a respected independent thinktank on foreign affairs , the Chatham House organization , says today . \nAccording to the body , which includes leading academics and former civil servants among its members , the key problem in the UK for preventing terrorism is that the country is `` riding as a pillion passenger with the United States in the war against terror '' . \nIt says Britain 's ability to carry out counter-terrorism measures has also been hampered because the US is always in the driving seat in deciding policy . \nThe report says the security services , diverted by fighting the IRA over Northern Ireland and the rise of animal activists committing terrorist acts , failed to give priority in the early 1990s to monitoring Islamist terror activists setting up in Britain , so `` the British authorities did not fully appreciate the threat from al-Qaida '' . \nIn the most politically sensitive finding , Chatham House , which used to be known as the Royal Institute of International Affairs , concludes there is `` no doubt '' the invasion of Iraq has `` given a boost to the al-Qaida network '' in `` propaganda , recruitment and fundraising '' , while providing an ideal targeting and training area for terrorists . \n`` Riding pillion with a powerful ally has proved costly in terms of British and US military lives , Iraqi lives , military expenditure and the damage caused to the counter-terrorism campaign . '' \nThis finding runs counter to the line from Downing Street , which has sought to detach Iraq from the London attacks . \nOn Saturday , Tony Blair said the fanatics who struck in London and launched other attacks around the world were driven by an `` evil ideology '' rather than opposition to any policy , and that it would be a `` misunderstanding of a catastrophic order '' to think that if we changed our behavior they would change theirs . \nAmid the growing debate over proposed terror laws in Britain , the Tories will today offer Charles Clarke , the home secretary , the chance to speed up new laws , provided that the government delays until next year proposals to revise the control orders system for detaining suspect terrorists . \nDavid Davis , the shadow home secretary , will ask the government to bring forward full details of one of the most divisive parts of the legislation - the indirect incitement to terrorism offence - by a month to September , so MPs and human rights groups such as Liberty can study them properly before the bill is published in October . \nMr Davis will make his offer during talks today with Mr Clarke , which will also be attended by Mark Oaten , the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman . \nLord Falconer , the lord chancellor , indicated yes terday that the government might be prepared to speed up anti-terror measures if it could reach agreement with the opposition parties . \nHe told BBC Radio 4 's Westminster Hour : `` We should not rush into things because these things need careful thought . \nBut if the opposition parties and the police can reach a consensus with us , then we can do it very quickly . '' \nAzzam Tamimi of the Muslim Association of Britain told a rally in Russell Square , near the scene of the bus bombing , that the Muslim community would not suffer in silence for the crimes of the suicide bombers . \n`` We will continue to talk , we will continue to write and we will continue to challenge the government . \nI say to Muslims , do not bow to pressure to keep accepting those pointing fingers at you . \n`` Say , ` No , I 'm not responsible for what happened on July 7 . \nMy heart bleeds , I condemn it , yes , but I did not make those boys angry . \nI did not send those bombs to Iraq . \nI do not keep people locked in Guantnamo Bay and I do not have anything to do with Abu Ghraib , except to denounce it .

{"id": "296", "time": "2005-07-20", "text": "Military chiefs furious at betrayal by politicians as prosecutions raise fears of further damage to soldiers ' confidence and reputation Wednesday 20 July 2005 02.08 BST The decision , announced by the attorney general late last night , to prosecute British soldiers for war crimes under the International Criminal Court Act , is a crushing blow for an army known and respected worldwide for its peacekeeping prowess and discipline . \nIn the Lords last week , former chiefs of defense staff lined up one after another to harangue the Ministry of Defense for succumbing to `` political correctness '' by allowing British soldiers to be subjected to legal constraints by lawyers who had no idea what it was like to face not a conventional enemy , but insurgents in Iraq , a uniquely dangerous security environment . \nIn a Lords debate last Thursday they voiced particular concern about the case of Trooper Kevin Williams of the 2nd Royal Tank Regiment , who was accused of murder in Iraq . \nThe case against him eventually collapsed when the crown prosecution service accepted that there was no realistic prospect of conviction . \nThey were reflecting deep concerns among serving military chiefs who feel they are being betrayed by their civil and political masters - with the exception , perhaps , of their new and sympathetic defense secretary , John Reid . \nDuring the debate , Field Marshal the Lord Inge , a former chief of the defense staff , said he dreaded the possibility that British servicemen would be tried by the ICC , warning that any such prosecution would undermine faith in the armed services ' chains of command . \nLord Boyce , the chief of defense staff at the time of the first war on Iraq , told peers : `` Our armed forces are under legal siege and are being pushed in the direction in which an order could be seen as improper or legally unsound . \nThey are being pushed by people not schooled in operations but only in political correctness . '' \nHe added : `` If we continue to travel down this road , there will come a point when the close relationship between the commanding officer and his or her people will be lost . \nIf that is destroyed the consequences could be serious . '' \nThe defense staff were assured by ministers that the ICC statute would have no impact on British soldiers . \nThe ICC was supposed to have been an essential plank in new Labor 's `` ethical '' foreign policy advocated by the then foreign secretary , Robin Cook . \nIt had been intended to target the war crimes that shocked the international community in such places as the Balkans and Africa . \nMoreover , the US refused to sign up to the ICC and the French obtained a `` get out '' clause for their troops . \nBritish soldiers , General Sir Mike Jackson , the head of the army , has insisted , are not above the law , but it may be galling for him to see his troops being dragged through the courts when so many others - including American troops - are getting off , the charges against those implicated in the Abu Ghraib prison scandal notwithstanding . \nEarlier this year a military review body reduced the sentences of two soldiers imprisoned for abusing Iraqi civilians in a case that drew comparisons with Abu Ghraib . \nBoth were found guilty of abusing Iraqi civilians suspected of looting in May 2003 . \nTheir trials in Germany focused on photographs taken of the abuse , which included dangling one man from a forklift truck . \nThe photos provoked outrage in Britain , with Tony Blair calling the images `` shocking and appalling '' . \nBritish soldiers , notably those engaged in fierce fighting against insurgents in Amara , a town some 100 miles north of Basra , have achieved heroic deeds , rewarded by a VC and other honors . \nThey have trained Iraqis and negotiated with tribal leaders in a way that has earned a level of trust which is the envy of American military commanders . \nThe new reality of policing war zones is a sharp rejoinder to that work but not the first time the modern British army has faced pressures - the most notable example being Northern Ireland . \nThe long-awaited , and costly , Saville inquiry report on the events of Bloody Sunday is expected to castigate the parachute regiment and the commanders for killing 13 unarmed Catholics on a civil rights March in Derry in January 1972 . \nPrevious reputation aside , those who have mistreated Iraqis amount to only a small fraction of the tens of thousands of British troops who have served there , insists the MoD . \nIf only the US had listened to the British and prepared properly for post-invasion things would have been so different , say military chiefs . \nYet this only part of the picture . \nBritish troops were ill-equipped and the chain of command cracked up - witness the deaths of six military policemen in southern Iraq in 2003 , deprived of ammunition and unable to communicate with their base . \nLawsuits damage morale and there are indications that the whole Iraq experience is seriously affecting recruitment , already hit by the scandals at Deepcut barracks . \nPressure and overstretch is affecting training . \nThese are not excuses , but if military commitments cheerfully agreed by the Blair government continue at their present rate without taxpayers prepared to cough up more for the military - and with Britain to take over control of Nato forces in Afghanistan next spring - then the reputation , and discipline , of the British army will be damaged , perhaps irretrievably . \nTwo separate cases have resulted in charges . \nThe first centres on allegations of offences against Iraqi detainees in Basra in September 2003 and involves seven servicemen . \nOne of the detainees , receptionist Baha Da'oud Salim Musa , died . \nThose charged in connection with this case are : Corporal Donald Payne , 34 , of the Queen 's Lancashire Regiment , accused of the manslaughter of Baha Musa . \nAlso charged with inhuman treatment of persons and perverting the course of justice . \nLance Corporal Wayne Crowcroft , 21 , of the Queen 's Lancashire Regiment : inhuman treatment of persons . \nPrivate Darren Fallon , 22 , of the Queen 's Lancashire Regiment : inhuman treatment . \nSergeant Kelvin Stacey , 28 , of the Queen 's Lancashire Regiment : assault causing actual bodily harm , alternatively common assault . \nWarrant Officer Mark Davies , 36 , of the Intelligence Corps : neglecting to perform a duty . \nMajor Michael Peebles , 34 , of the Intelligence Corps : negligently performing a duty . \nColonel Jorge Mendonca , 41 , lately of the Queen 's Lancashire Regiment : negligently performing a duty . \nThe second case involves four servicemen and relates to the alleged killing of Ahmed Kareem , an Iraqi civilian , in Basra on May 8 2003 . \nSergeant Carle Selman , 38 , of the Scots Guards : unlawful killing of Kareem . \nGuardsman Martin McGing , 21 , of the Irish Guards : unlawful killing of Kareem . \nGuardsman Joseph McCleary , 23 , of the Irish Guards : unlawful killing of Kareem . \nA 21-year-old lance corporal with the Irish Guards has also been charged with the unlawful killing of Kareem but has yet to be informed . \n"}

'' \nThe war on terror , Iraq and Afghanistan were all seen by a section of British Muslims as being acts against Islam . \n`` This disillusionment may contribute to a sense of helplessness with regard to the situation of Muslims in the world , with a lack of any tangible ` pressure valves ' , in order to vent frustrations , anger or dissent , '' said the paper . \nDespite this warning last month , Jtac lowered its terrorist threat level on the grounds that there was thought to be no single `` group with both the current intent and the capability to attack the UK '' . \nBut it added : `` Whilst the threat from al-Qaida leadership-directed plots have not gone away , many of our current concerns focus on a wide range and large number of extremist networks and individuals in the UK and individuals and groups that are inspired by , but only loosely affiliated to , al-Qaida or are entirely autonomous . ' \n`` Some of these have the potential to plan UK attacks and it is also possible that lone extremists or small groups could attempt lower-level attacks . '' \nThe mayor of London , Ken Livingstone , yesterday suggested the four suicide bombers were prompted - at least in part - by long-standing grievances . \nDuring his weekly press briefing at City Hall , Mr Livingstone said he could not read the bombers ' minds but added : `` I think there were several levels that led those young men to come to London to kill . \nOne is 85 years of western intervention in the affairs of the Middle East . '' \nHe said the west had repeatedly meddled `` because we wished to preserve oil supplies '' , adding : `` I think for the last nearly 60 years we have this terrible running sore of the dispossession of the Palestinians which is the single most important wound in the Islamic psyche . '' \nThe mayor also rounded on media critics of the Muslim cleric Yusef al-Qaradawi , amid reports that the controversial theologian is coming to Britain for a conference early next month . \nNewspapers accuse the cleric of supporting suicide bombing and have called for him to be banned . \nEgypt said yesterday that Magdi el-Nashar , a detained chemist wanted by Britain for questioning over the London bombings , had no links to the attacks nor to al-Qaida . \nA group called Abu Hafs al Masri Brigades , an al-Qaida-linked group , threatened yesterday to launch `` a bloody war '' on the capitals of European countries that do not remove their troops from Iraq within a month . \nThe group has no proven record of attacks , and experts have doubted its claims in the past . \n"}

'' \nThe prison was at the center of a political storm after revelations of mistreatment and torture of Iraqi inmates by their US guards . \nThe scandal was exposed last April with the publication of photographs and video film showing US soldiers abusing naked Iraqis and forcing them to perform sex acts . \nThe furore damaged the rep utation of the US army and paved the way for the disclosure of other abuses of Iraqi detainees by foreign troops in Iraq , including by British soldiers in the largely Shia south . \nMr Amin , whose ministry monitors conditions in Iraq 's US-run penal facilities , said the transfer will begin after the formation of the new Iraqi government , which is due to happen in the next few weeks . \nThe transfer would take place gradually and sensibly : `` Iraq still needs time and international assistance and training to prepare and control and run and manage these prisons in a fit and proper way . '' \nUS military officials in Baghdad could not be reached for comment yesterday . \nBut on Tuesday an army official said US forces were considering pulling out of Abu Ghraib be cause of a spate of attacks on the facility by insurgents . \nLast April , a barrage of 28 mortar rounds killed 22 prisoners and injured 91 . \nThe army official said the US would probably transfer only high security detainees in Abu Ghraib to another facility at the US base at Baghdad 's airport , while the majority of the `` common criminals '' would remain under Iraqi control . \nThe US-run prison system in Iraq is currently bloated with detainees . \nMore than 10,000 are estimated to be behind bars - the highest number since the insurgency began in 2003 . \nTheir ranks have swollen during the crackdowns by US and Iraqi security forces before and after the January 30 elections . \nHowever the rounding up of large numbers of suspects appears to be having little effect on the operational effectiveness of the insurgents . \nIn further grim news yesterday , Iraqi officials said that 35 bodies , some shot execution-style , others beheaded , had been discovered at two sites , one just south of the capital and the other near the western border with Syria . \nThere are three main US detention centres in Iraq : Abu Ghraib , on the western outskirts of the capital , which holds about 3,160 detainees ; Camp Bucca near the southern city of Umm Qasr , which has at least 5,640 ; and Camp Cropper at the Baghdad international airport complex , where Saddam Hussein and the leaders of the former Ba'athist regime are being held pending trial . \nA fourth detention center is run by British forces at Shaibah near the southern city of Basra , where 818 people are being held . \nMr Amin said he understood this would also be included in the handover . \n`` After the era of the Saddam regime , where an Iraqi prison was a byword for torture and murder , and the shock of the prisoner abuse by US military guards , a smooth handover would go a long way to restoring the credibility of the country 's justice and penal system . '' \nMr Amin said conditions at the detention centres had improved enormously since the Abu Ghraib scandal broke , and admitted there were no guarantees that Iraq 's burgeoning prison population would fare any better under Iraqi jurisdiction . \nA state department report last week said that human rights abuses were occurring under the interim Iraqi government , including torture , illegal detention by police and forced confessions , though it accepted that `` a long legacy of serious human rights abuses '' under Saddam had been reversed . \n`` We can not expect the system to become like Denmark 's or Sweden 's overnight , '' Mr Amin conceded . \n`` Saddam created many mini-Saddams . '' \nHe said it was crucial that guarantees of human rights in the justice system be included in the permanent constitution that will be drafted by the new parliament . \n"}

{"id": "35", "time": "2005-03-19", "text": "How new is `` New Labor '' ? \nIn the heady years after 1997 , the ideologues worked hard to promote an image of youth . \nLabor 's troublesome past , they proclaimed , had been thrown overboard along with its commitment to a socialist economy set down in Clause Four of the 1918 constitution . \nIn place of a history , there was a future . \nThe party could now adopt or reject slogans and symbols according to the demands of its current branding strategy . \nHence the appearance of an increasingly bizarre set of stage props starting with `` Cool Britannia '' and climaxing in 2001 with the improbable pink makeover of the British bull-dog . \nBut that was all before 9\\/11 , before the coupling with Bush and the Iraq war . \nNow New Labor talks little about its former flirtations with the young . \nBetter to present itself as the authentic continuation of a social-democratic past . \nThis is the point of Patrick Diamond 's New Labor 's Old Roots -LRB- Imprint Academic , # 14.95 -RRB- , a collection of `` revisionist '' Labor texts running from RH Tawney in 1931 to Gordon Brown in 1997 . \nDiamond is a Downing Street adviser and his claim is strongly endorsed by Tony Blair who now depicts New Labor as `` a party which has returned to its roots '' . \nBut talk of `` roots '' and continuities can also be misleading . \nIt suggests a soft-focus constancy of identity and beliefs that a sharper look at Labor 's history belies . \nWhat chiefly emerges from the brief biographies and memoirs also noticed here - of Aneurin Bevan , Roy Jenkins and Tony Benn - is the sheer diversity encompassed by Labor and its Whig , liberal and puritan forebears . \nParticularly striking is Tony Benn 's moving childhood memoir , Dare to Be a Daniel -LRB- Hutchinson , # 17.95 -RRB- . \nBenn was brought up in an affluent home , the product of a family publishing empire and two generations of engagement in London progressive politics . \nHis father was a Liberal MP who turned to Labor in the 1920s and served in Labor cabinets in 1931 and 1945 . \nThe young Benn grew up with a nurse , cook `` and servants to keep house '' ; he came from a family of Lib-Lab political insiders living next door to Sidney and Beatrice Webb on the site of the present Millbank Tower . \nThe Benns were authentic Puritans . \nEver since the writings of George Eliot and Matthew Arnold , Puritanism has been associated with the provinces , with the energy , ambition yet narrowness of the outsider . \nBut the metropolitan puritanism of the Benns was no less intense . \nThe Benn family were - as Benn still is - teetotal . \nThey were not intellectuals . \nHis parents showed no interest in whether the young Tony read or what he read : `` All my life I have lived in the oral tradition , learning from listening and watching rather than reading . '' \nThis helps to explain why Benn retains such an unruffled belief in a Manichean world in which the forces of good are in perpetual combat with the backsliding and corruption of false friends . \nFrom the Old Testament stories of his mother , Benn learned to honor prophets , not kings . \nIn this picture of politics as a modern day Pilgrim 's Progress , Marx -LRB- despite his atheism -RRB- is honored as `` the last of the Old Testament prophets '' . \nBenn 's parents showed no interest in culture . \nThey lived next door to the Tate Gallery , yet never went inside . \nParsimony was one reason . \nWhen his father once passed the Tate , what clinched his decision not to enter was `` that it would cost him sixpence '' . \nBut what mattered most was not to waste time . \nFrom the 17th century onwards , Puritans were prone to keep diaries in order to justify to God their use of time . \nBenn 's father kept a daily time chart to set down the number of hours he had worked . \nBenn 's own diary-keeping and the assembling of his political life into a huge domestic archive was clearly inspired by his father . \nIf Benn recalls the Puritan inheritance of Labor , Bevan represented the secular revolt against it . \nAlthough his father was an active Baptist as well as treasurer of the local miners ' lodge , neither religion nor the Puritan ethic left much mark upon Bevan . \nIndeed , in later years he combined his socialism with a taste for high living . \nBevan 's education was not a product of home , school or chapel , but of the Central Labor College where he learned Marxian economics and the history of Labor 's struggle . \nLike Benn in the 70s , Bevan in the 50s found himself the leader of a leftwing rebellion within the Labor party . \nBut as Clare and Francis Beckett point out in their lucid short biography , Bevan -LRB- Haus , # 9.99 -RRB- , he was uninterested in the `` self-righteous sectarianism '' in which the Bennites would later wrap themselves . \nFor Bevan the question was `` where was power and which was the road to it '' , a power which he wished to exercise on behalf of `` the working class '' . \nThis attitude resulted not only in the foundation of the National Health Service in 1948 , but in his provision of the best of 20th-century public housing through an insistence on high quality standards in the Housing Act of 1946 . \nIn Labor mythology Jenkins was often considered the polar opposite of Bevan . \nHe was the suave Gaitskellite who split the party and so made possible the triumph of Margaret Thatcher . \nBut the young Jenkins himself was once a Bevanite , only switching to Gaitskell once convinced , like Tony Crosland , that socialism should be identified with equality , rather than public ownership . \nLike Bevan unaffected by religion , Jenkins also presided over the dismantling of the puritan moral code which had governed Britain since the triumph of Evangelicalism in Victorian times . \nBut unlike Bevan , Jenkins was from the beginning a Labor insider -LRB- his father became Attlee 's political secretary -RRB- and received a good formal education culminating in his time at Balliol College , Oxford , where he mixed easily with the children of the privileged classes . \nIn this respect he was an early embodiment of the decline of deference and loosening of social mores which were to become celebrated after 1964 . \nGaitskell had felt disturbed by this trend in the 50s . \nHe associated it with the decline of the old service ethic of the upper middle class : `` Tony -LRB- Crosland -RRB- and Roy are not upper and I sometimes feel they do n't have a proper humility to ordinary working people . '' \nThe receding tide of Puritanism on the one hand , and noblesse oblige on the other , also had its grosser side . \nAlan Watkins recalls that as a young reporter , lunch with a politician often involved `` a large aperitif beforehand , sharing a bottle of wine with the meal and ... brandy afterwards with his coffee . '' \nNew Labor would probably be as appalled as their Edwardian ancestors . \nThe thoughtful accounts found in Roy Jenkins : A Retrospective , edited by Andrew Adonis and Keith Thomas -LRB- OUP , # 18.99 -RRB- , that deal with Jenkins 's detachment from Labor after the electoral defeat of 1970 , read more like a tale of accident and misadventure than of the irresistible rise of a new political force . \nLike Bevan in the 50s , Jenkins was a reluctant rebel . \nBut for Europe and his absence from parliament after the move to Brussels in 1977 , the split with Labor might not have occurred . \nThe much-flagged Dimbleby Lecture of 1979 was anything but epic . \nShirley Williams described it as `` a mildly interesting academic lecture '' . \nBut electoral defeat and the ferocity of internecine party warfare , spearheaded by an intolerant Bennite left , appeared to offer `` the Gang of Four '' no point of return . \nAlready by 1983 , however , after a spirited challenge at the Warrington byelection and victory at Glasgow , Hillhead , Jenkins was suffering from `` battle fatigue '' . \nAnd things only got worse as he found himself confronted by the deviousness of David Steel and the surliness of David Owen , whose `` tough and tender '' program Jenkins dubbed `` sub-Thatcherite '' . \nIt would be easy to point to Jenkins 's personal weaknesses in recounting this unhappy story . \nBut in the end , as the invaluable collection of documents assembled in New Labor 's Old Roots reveals , there was in Labor a collective failure of ethos and aim . \nFor in the crisis which produced Labor 's defeat , Bennism and the SDP , the hallucinating reversion of an infantile left to nationalisation and Europhobia was only a symptom of a wider inability to come to terms with the breakdown of what David Marquand calls `` Keynesian social democracy '' . \nThis was the belief most elegantly encapsulated in Crosland 's 1956 Future of Socialism that increasing equality could be painlessly achieved through a combination of economic growth and high social spending without a fundamental reform of the institutions and assumptions of the existing state . \nThis policy left Labor wholly unprepared to deal with it , and in part even fuelled `` the mounting inflation , swelling balance of payments deficits , unprecedented currency depreciation , rising unemployment , bitter industrial conflict and ebbing governability '' for which the Wilson-Callaghan years are remembered . \nBy republishing the incisive essays of Mackintosh , Marquand , Radice and others , Diamond rightly emphasises that the revision of Croslandite assumptions about social-democracy was as crucial as the need to revise Clause Four . \nBut to get the full measure of this problem which still lurks just beneath the surface of New Labor , we need to set it in a longer time-frame . \nFor `` revisionism '' did not begin in 1994 , not even with Gaitskell in 1960 , but at least as far back as 1918 . \nLabor before 1914 did not aspire to power . \nIt was a party committed to defend the trade unions ' right to organise and secure parliamentary representation . \nCommitment to public ownership in 1918 was a `` revision '' put forward not by utopians or Marxists , but by sober-minded Fabians and hard-headed trade union leaders , convinced - as was Lenin - by the practical successes of state control of wartime industry . \nDuring the inter-war years and well into the 40s , there was no Labor intellectual , be it Tawney , Durbin , Dalton or Gaitskell , who did not believe in the superiority of a planned economy with a large measure of public ownership . \nBut public ownership was not the defining point of socialism . \nIt only became so during the 50s when Bevan equated it with a commitment to Clause Four in contrast to Crosland 's emphasis upon equality . \nIf these were the decisive doctrinal turning points in Labor 's history before 1960 , the period between Gaitskell and `` New Labor '' delivered a massive blow to each of these three possible foundations for Labor advance : first , the assumption crucial to Clause Four , that socialist planned economies were superior , widely believed in the 30s and still present in the Labor National Plan of 1964 , disappeared in the following 20 years as the economic inefficiency of Soviet communism became increasingly apparent . \nSecond , the privileged legal position of trade unions , first established in the 1870s and reinforced by the foundation of the Labor party in 1900 , was discredited by trade union militancy in `` the winter of discontent '' and dismantled by Thatcher and Norman Tebbit in the bitter aftermath of the 1983 miners ' strike . \nLastly , Keynesian assumptions about economic management upon which Crosland 's egalitarian strategy depended were destroyed by the economic crises of the 1970s . \nSeen in this way , it becomes clear that `` New Labor '' is not really new ; yet equally clear that `` the roots '' to which the party might wish to return are frail or no longer existent . \nThe question that destroyed the coherence and ultimately the existence of the SDP was what to put in place of the defense of the trade unions , Clause Four or Crosland 's vision of equality . \nSo far , `` New Labor '' has managed to keep this question at bay , just as Harold Wilson deferred the question of Clause Four for more than a decade . \nIt has done so by good economic management , by the wooing of middle England through the black arts of triangulation and spin , and by the modest , but real commitment to the reduction of poverty , both nationally and internationally . \nBut should the bad times ever return - Iraq and possible economic downturn suggest they might - `` New Labor '' would do well to start thinking now about an alternative basis for a politics of equality . \nGareth Stedman Jones 's book An End to Poverty ? \nis published by Profile . \n"}

'' \nThe cost of the Iraqi adventure was heavy . \nAccording to a team of medical investigators sent by Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore , more than 100,000 Iraqi civilians died . \nTorture , encouraged from above , became a fact of life . \nPerhaps some good liberal apologist for Blair will soon explain how democratic torture is much nicer than authoritarian torture . \nPerhaps the belligerati could take this further . \nIan McEwan 's next novel could sensitively depict dilemmas of a liberal torturer faced with the barbaric Orient . \nWe live , after all , in a world where illusions are sacred and truth profane . \nMeanwhile , as some -LRB- non-Labour -RRB- MPs contemplate impeaching Blair for lying and other misdemeanors , a general election draws near in Britain . \nWhat are we going to do ? \nIf Blair wins this election -LRB- as appears likely -RRB- , he will claim , like Bush , that the country supports him in these difficult times . \nIt is for this reason that those who opposed the war must think carefully before they cast their votes . \nAbstention is not a serious option . \nThe aim should be to return an anti-war majority to the House of Commons . \nThis requires tactical\\/intelligent voting in every constituency . \nNormally , people vote to assert their political sympathies . \nBut this is not a normal general election . \nIt will be the first opportunity to punish the warmongers and , given the undemocratic voting system , the votes cast for the Greens , Respect and others will have no impact , with a possible exception in Bethnal Green and Bow , east London , where George Galloway confronts the warmonger Oona King . \nIt is possible that in some constituencies the Green\\/Respect vote could ensure the return of a warmonger , as we have seen in the odd byelection . \nSo why not treat this election as special and take the politics of the broad anti-war front to the electoral arena ? \nIf the result is a hung parliament or a tiny Blair majority , it will be seen as a victory for our side . \nBlair has led this country into more wars than Thatcher and Major combined . \nHe is responsible for more deaths than his Tory predecessors and with fewer popular votes to back him . \nIn 1992 , the year Neil Kinnock was defeated by John Major , the Labor vote was 11.5 million . \nIn 2001 , New Labor 's indecent majority was based on a popular vote of 10.7 million . \nTurnout dropped from 71 % in 1997 to 59 % in 2001 . \nThe rival claimant to the throne , Gordon Brown , provided a hallucinatory explanation : people were so relaxed and happy under New Labor that they could n't be bothered to vote . \nPsephology beckons , Gordon . \nIn reality , it was the collapse of the Tories that distorted the results . \nNew Labor 's massive majorities have been based on mass abstentions and a blatantly undemocratic electoral system . \nThe assault on civil liberties mounted by Blair and Blunkett is far more serious than the appalling internment without trial that Edward Heath instituted during the Troubles . \nThe tribal notion that New Labor is somehow qualitatively better than the Tories is pure sentimentality . \nIt is not supported by the facts . \nWith the abandonment of anything resembling traditional social democracy , New Labor has concentrated on intrigue , treachery and infamy . \nHow else can one characterise the long Blair-Brown struggle for mastery of No 10 ? \nDespite the fact that politics has evaporated inside New Labor , the demonstration had its impact . \nA total of 139 Labor MPs voted against the war . \nRobin Cook resigned from the cabinet . \nClare Short was pushed out . \nGeorge Galloway , the most consistent opponent in parliament , was expelled from the Labor party . \nThe Liberal Democrats , Scottish Nationalists and Plaid Cymru voted against as well . \nIn constituencies where there are MPs belonging to the anti-war faction , one should vote for them despite disagreements on many other issues . \nIn the warmonger constituencies we should vote tactically . \nIn my north London constituency , the MP is Barbara Roche : pro-war and pro everything else this wretched government has done . \nI do n't simply want to vote against her . \nI want her to be defeated . \nThat is why I will vote Liberal Democrat . \nA version of this article appears in the April issue of Red Pepper Letters for publication should be sent to : letters@guardian.co.uk If you need help using the site : userhelp@guardian.co.uk Call the main Guardian and Observer switchboard : Tariq Ali : For one day only , I 'm a Lib Dem This article was published on guardian . \n"}

'' \nBut in big and small ways things are changing . \nCity authorities and residents themselves are injecting color and vitality through initiatives designed to beautify Baghdad . \nMunicipal workers have planted thousands of bushes and trees along thoroughfares and intersections . \nIt is easy to miss them now but within six months some species will be waist-high foliage , said Mustafa al-Ubadi , 35 , pointing to freshly planted rows of leafless saplings opposite his fish restaurant on Abu Nawas street . \nEmboldened by better security and business , he plans to return paintings he stored at home for safety to the bare walls of his restaurant . \nThis week trucks unloaded tonnes of soil on to the east bank of the Tigris , which is to be laid with grass , dotted with benches and linked to a new park due to open later this year . \nThere will be a fountain , swings and slides , said Kadhim Radhi , 40 , a council worker at the site . \nThis weekend the city will regain a favorite playground : Jadriya lake , formerly known as Saddam lake . \nBuilt on farmland a year before his fall , the 36-hectare -LRB- 90-acre -RRB- expanse of water with kiosks along its banks was popular with families and couples . \nBut American tanks smashed the paving and when looters stole electric cables and pumps the lake drained into the Tigris , leaving the site dry and desolate . \nSix months ago the tourist board , part of the culture ministry , funded its restoration and the lake is back . \nKiosks with pictures of Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck have been painted in vivid blue , red and yellow . \nSpeedboats were tested on the lake yesterday and musicians practiced for the opening ceremony . \n`` It 's like a lung for the city , '' said Abdul Razaq Ali , a supervisor . \nHe looked forward to the return of foreigners . \n`` Give me security and I 'll give you tourists , '' he said . \nHilal Shawkat , head of the Iraqi investment firm which restored the lake , said he would build restaurants and amusement parks around the shore . \n`` This will revive the nightlife of Baghdad , '' he said , carrying an armful of glossy company brochures for architectural plans . \nOne of them , entitled Happy Land in Baghdad , included a 500-room , five-star hotel near the lake . \n`` Iraq will be back to normal in two years , '' said Mr Shawkat , ignoring a burst of gunfire and sirens in the distance . \nOrdinary Baghdadis are puncturing the drab greyness with flowers and potted plants which have become more visible in homes and shops , cheering the likes of Talab Hadi , 38 , a third-generation horticulturist . \n`` Business is 10 times better than six months ago , '' he beamed . \n`` People want color . '' \nBut the city is far removed from its glorious heritage . \nSaid by some historians to be the site of the Garden of Eden , it was founded in AD762 by Caliph Abu Ja ` far al-Mansour and became the heart of medieval Muslim civilisation , a political capital as well as an architectural wonder immortalised in stories such as the 1001 Nights . \nThe Mongols , among others , razed it several times , but Baghdad recovered and 19th century visitors proclaimed it the most beautiful city in the east . \nIn the 70s it began to deteriorate . \nSaddam Hussein erected brutalist apartment blocks and kitsch monuments , and uprooted trees from river banks lest they provide cover for assassins . \nWar with Iran and the first Gulf war drained resources , while economic sanctions and an explosion in population , estimated at 5.6 million , crippled the infrastructure . \nUS dollars gushed with the occupation , but they did little to alleviate banes such as the green zone , a heavily fortified swath of embassies and government buildings which burned a hole in the city 's heart , closing bridges and roads . \nIn addition to concrete and razor wire , the security crisis necessitated a curfew which prevents night-time street cleaning , producing mounds of waste . \nFour children collecting litter yesterday were killed by a bomb hidden in the rubbish which was probably intended for US or Iraqi security forces . \nWhen Saddam fell the new-found freedom eroded civic mindedness because there was no authority to fear , said Adnan Omran , 57 , a municipal manager . \nDrivers would park their cars anywhere they liked and rubbish was dumped at random . \nIncreased staffing and pay have given him the means to crack down on these nuisances , starting with shops which displayed wares on pavements . \n`` What about pedestrians ? '' \nsaid Mr Omran , indignant . \nSix months ago Bradt Travel Guides published what was probably the first postwar guidebook for Baghdad . \nIf you do not enjoy Iraq 's capital , at least appreciate the residents , it said . \n`` They are a justifiably proud people , whose city was the capital of the world when London was an overgrown village and Columbus several centuries away from America . \n`` War has not destroyed this and western condescension is met with the scorn it deserves .

'' \nFor those interested in keeping the earth intact in its present shape so that we might one day live on it peacefully , the bombings of July 7 provide no such `` opportunities '' . \nThey do not `` clarify '' or `` sharpen '' but muddy and bloody already murky waters . \nAs the identities of the missing emerge , we move from a statistical body count to the tragedy of human loss - brothers , mothers , lovers and daughters cruelly blown away as they headed to work . \nThe space to mourn these losses must be respected . \nThe demand that we abandon rational thought , contextual analysis and critical appraisal of why this happened and what we can do to limit the chances that it will happen again , should not . \nTo explain is not to excuse ; to criticise is not to capitulate . \nWe know what took place . \nA group of people , with no regard for law , order or our way of life , came to our city and trashed it . \nWith scant regard for human life or political consequences , employing violence as their sole instrument of persuasion , they slaughtered innocent people indiscriminately . \nThey left us feeling unified in our pain and resolute in our convictions , effectively creating a community where one previously did not exist . \nWith the killers probably still at large there is no civil liberty so vital that some would not surrender it in pursuit of them and no punishment too harsh that some might not sanction if we found them . \nThe trouble is there is nothing in the last paragraph that could not just as easily be said from Falluja as it could from London . \nThe two should not be equated - with over 1,000 people killed or injured , half its housing wrecked and almost every school and mosque damaged or flattened , what Falluja went through at the hands of the US military , with British support , was more deadly . \nBut they can and should be compared . \nWe do not have a monopoly on pain , suffering , rage or resilience . \nOur blood is no redder , our backbones are no stiffer , nor our tear ducts more productive than the people in Iraq and Afghanistan . \nThose whose imagination could not stretch to empathise with the misery we have caused in the Gulf now have something closer to home to identify with . \n`` Collateral damage '' always has a human face : its relatives grieve ; its communities have memory and demand action . \nThese basic humanistic precepts are the principle casualties of fundamentalism , whether it is wedded to Muhammad or the market . \nThey were clearly absent from the minds of those who bombed London last week . \nThey are no less absent from the minds of those who have pursued the war on terror for the past four years . \nTony Blair is not responsible for the more than 50 dead and 700 injured on Thursday . \nIn all likelihood , `` jihadists '' are . \nBut he is partly responsible for the 100,000 people who have been killed in Iraq . \nAnd even at this early stage there is a far clearer logic linking these two events than there ever was tying Saddam Hussein to either 9\\/11 or weapons of mass destruction . \nIt is no mystery why those who have backed the war in Iraq would refute this connection . \nWith each and every setback , from the lack of UN endorsement right through to the continuing strength of the insurgency , they go ever deeper into denial . \nTheir sophistry has now mutated into a form of political autism - their ability to engage with the world around them has been severely impaired by their adherence to a flawed and fatal project . \nTo say that terrorists would have targeted us even if we had n't gone into Iraq is a bit like a smoker justifying their habit by saying , `` I could get run over crossing the street tomorrow . '' \nTrue , but the certain health risks of cigarettes are more akin to playing chicken on a four-lane highway . \nThey have the effect of bringing that fatal , fateful day much closer than it might otherwise be . \nSimilarly , invading Iraq clearly made us a target . \nDid Downing Street really think it could declare a war on terror and that terror would not fight back ? \nThat , in itself , is not a reason to withdraw troops if having them there is the right thing to do . \nBut since it is n't and never was , it provides a compelling reason to change course before more people are killed here or there . \nSo the prime minister got it partly right on Saturday when he said : `` I think this type of terrorism has very deep roots . \nAs well as dealing with the consequences of this - trying to protect ourselves as much as any civil society can - you have to try to pull it up by its roots . '' \nWhat he would not acknowledge is that his alliance with President George Bush has been sowing the seeds and fertilising the soil in the Gulf , for yet more to grow . \nThe invasion and occupation of Iraq - illegal , immoral and inept - provided the Arab world with one more legitimate grievance . \nBush laid down the gauntlet : you 're either with us or with the terrorists . \nA small minority of young Muslims looked at the values displayed in Abu Ghraib , Guantnamo Bay and Camp Bread Basket - and made their choice . \nThe war helped transform Iraq from a vicious , secular dictatorship with no links to international terrorism into a magnet and training ground for those determined to commit terrorist atrocities . \nMeanwhile , it diverted our attention and resources from the very people we should have been fighting - al-Qaida . \nAs early as February 2003 the joint intelligence committee reported that al-Qaida and associated groups continued to represent `` by far the greatest terrorist threat to western interests , and that that threat would be heightened by military action against Iraq '' . \nAt the World Economic Forum last year , Gareth Evans , the former Australian foreign minister and head of the International Crisis Group thinktank , said : `` The net result of the war on terror is more war and more terror . \nLook at Iraq : the least plausible reason for going to war - terrorism - has been its most harrowing consequence . '' \nNone of that justifies what the bombers did . \nBut it does help explain how we got where we are and what we need to do to move to a safer place . \nIf Blair did n't know the invasion would make us more vulnerable , he is negligent ; if he did , then he should take responsibility for his part in this . \nThat does not mean we deserved what was coming . \nIt means we deserve a lot better . \n"}

'' \nThe BBC 's Ten O'Clock News used two mobile phone sequences shot by members of the public , and the main picture used on its online news service on Thursday was taken by a passer-by . \n`` People are very media-savvy . \nWe saw the use of what we call ` user-generated material ' in the tsunami and at the floods in Boscastle . \nBut as people get used to creating pictures and videos on their phones in normal life , they increasingly think of sending them to us when major incidents occur . '' \nBoaden believes the growing interaction between the public and broadcasters is changing the media for the better . \n`` It shows there is a terrific level of trust between the audience and us , creating a more intimate relationship than in the past . \nIt shows a new closeness forming between BBC news and the public . \nEach big story that happens confirms that . '' \nMore than 300 emails containing an average of three images and about 30 video clips were sent to the yourpics@bbc.co.uk address on Thursday . \nThe iconic picture of the devastated bus at Tavistock Square was sent to the website within 45 minutes of the bombing and was subsequently used on the front pages of the Guardian and the Daily Mail on Friday . \nSome mobile phone video footage was on air just 20 minutes after being received by rolling news channels . \nBen Rayner , the editor of the ITV News channel , says ITN was sent more than a dozen video clips from mobile phones on Thursday , and the clips - some so graphic as to render them unusable - played an important role in getting across to viewers the nature of the story . \n`` It 's the way forward for instant newsgathering , especially when it involves an attack on the public , '' he believes . \nMobile phone video clips and stills were posted on to internet sites alongside first-hand accounts of people 's experiences , building up a vast catalogue of DIY coverage more comprehensive and wide-ranging than anything available through the mainstream media . \nJohn Ryley , the executive editor of Sky News , says video from the bombed tube between King 's Cross and Russell Square stations was received at 12.40 pm and was on air by 1pm . \n`` It raises questions for the authorities but these devices allow a democratisation of news . \nNews crews usually get there just after the event , but these pictures show us the event as it happens , `` says Ryley . \nOne senior BBC broadcaster sums up the effect of mobile phone videos being used on the corporation 's news : `` I sat down and watched the Ten O'Clock News last night and thought ` this is a media turning point ' . \nIt was revolutionary . '' \nJust as the internet was said to have arrived as a major news source during the events of 9\\/11 , blogging may come to be seen as the new news essential as of last week - from Wednesday , when email inboxes and irreverent blogs burst with pictures mocking the French Olympic bid , to 24 hours later when the internet mood had utterly changed . \nAnd with traditional news outlets initially struggling to make sense of conflicting reports in the minutes and hours that followed the four blasts , many people turned to the internet . \nIt was not the first time that news websites have seen a huge hike in traffic due to a big story , but this time - partly because it took place during office hours and partly because blogs have now become a familiar part of online life - many people also then turned to less formal sites . \nAnthony Barnett , editor-in-chief at global politics and culture site OpenDemocracy , which runs its own blog , has also noted the change . \n`` The blog mechanism has come in since 9\\/11 and has created quite a natural form , '' he says . \nFor Open Democray and others , including some traditional media owners such as the Guardian and the New York Times , the blog provides an increasingly crucial addition to their core online services . \nLiveJournal , a community site , attracted hundreds of posts during the day . \nMost of them provided practical information , such as transport updates , pleas for missing persons and links to the latest news updates from around the world . \n`` The community has worked best because it was more timely than conventional news media - but now they 're very much on the scene , providing a full news and analysis service , and London is trying to get back to normal , '' the site 's administrator wrote last Friday morning . \nWith every blog posting on the subject and linking to other postings and news stories , it is possible to track the progress of information and conjecture around the web . \nTechnorati , a website that tracks around 12.2 million blogs , reported a 30 % increase in blogging activity on Thursday , when nine of the top 10 searches were about the bombings . \nAnd while the benefits of the internet in times of crisis were apparent - as a place to find practical information fast , as a giant message board to search for missing people , find communal comfort and debate the issues - last week also highlighted its downside . \nOn some blogs , and certainly on many message boards , rational debate descended into the raving and the mawkish . \nAnd even the plain baffling - witness one US contributor who wrote : `` I 'm probably only proving that I 'm a total Star Wars wonk , but I thought the last page of the novelisation of Revenge of the Sith seemed fitting here ... '' The attack was the first big breaking news story since the BBC published its new editorial guidelines that made explicit the new `` accuracy is more important than speed '' creed . \nWith so many people turning to breaking news during the day , whether on the digital rolling news channels or the main networks that had ripped up their schedules , clear differences in tone , style and content were laid bare to a mass audience for the first time . \nBBC News 24 was noticeably more cautious in its coverage than Sky News , which rushed to get as much information - speculation or fact - on air . \nITV , meanwhile , sat somewhere between the two . \nIn truth , the differences have been evident for some time , since the Lambert report into BBC News 24 required it to become more distinctive . \nBut with a far bigger audience than the usual news junkie crowd , the differences hit home to many viewers for the first time . \n`` We get confirmed facts on air immediately but it 's true we 're cautious about some wire copy or internet-type rumors that we ca n't substantiate ourselves , '' says Roger Mosey , head of television news at the BBC . \n`` At times on Thursday we were getting ` eyewitness accounts ' saying completely contradictory things that could n't possibly all be true . '' \nIn the two hours that followed the first blast , there was so much conjec ture flying around that the rolling news channels had to be very much on their guard . \nThere are even those who believe the `` power surge disruption '' explanation was a deliberate piece of disinformation disseminated by the authorities to prevent panic . \nMosey says that the BBC would only `` put on screen what we know is right - reports from our own correspondents , the official emergency service figures and information from members of the public that we 've checked out '' . \nThis `` safety first '' attitude was also in evidence on radio : `` We now have a very cautious approach to this . \nWe try to get it right even if it sacrifices being first . \nWe are seeking to ensure that our information is very strongly sourced before going with something like a casualty figure , '' says Stephen Mitchell , BBC head of radio news . \nNick Pollard , head of Sky News , makes a subtle distinction , saying viewers are now in tune with the rhythms of rolling news and expect a more complete picture to build up throughout the day . \n`` We take very seriously our reputation as the place to turn to when there 's big breaking news . \nIt 's what we 're there for , '' says Pollard . \n`` We tell viewers what we can see , what we know and what we do n't know . '' \nFor today 's news-savvy audiences , it was important that Sky got the news out quickly on a big developing story , he says , provided that they were told where the information came from : `` We scrupulously try to tell people our source - that 's something we 've learned over the past three to four years . '' \nApart from the proliferation of user-generated content , the coverage was notable for its restraint . \n`` It 's a very fine line . \nI always maintained the point of view that in such a terrible incident we should show what we need to show and no more , '' says David Mannion , editor-in-chief of ITV News . \nMannion believes that the authorities appeared to be over-cautious in updating the casualty figures - with the result that foreign news wires and broadcasters were getting more up-to-date information from their own government sources . \n`` I think it was extraordinary to some degree . \nIt seems to me that the Home Office and the Met adopted a policy of not adding to the death toll until they had informed relatives , '' he says , adding that it led to a situation where the people of Australia were better informed than Londoners . \n`` That is ridiculous . \nWe 're all grown ups and I think it 's treating the public with a degree of disrespect to hide the truth . '' \n`` Many of us felt the angel of death brush past us yesterday morning . '' \nSuddenly even the agony aunt was a frontline reporter . \nLast Thursday , everyone was a potential eyewitness and the Sun 's Deidre Sanders , who survived the Asian tsunami , found herself at King 's Cross just after 9am , face-to-face with survivors of the underground blast . \nShe described in spare , moving prose `` the huddle of shaken men and women , with red-rimmed eyes , their faces black with soot '' . \nFlick forward a few pages and the paper 's TV critic and `` Aldgate resident '' Ally Ross was shocked to see his own flat flashed up on a television news report . \nThe view from his living room window was unsettling : `` Two policemen , armed with machine guns , are standing outside our packed local fun pub , '' he observed . \nSome of the accounts were almost too grim to read . \nThe Daily Mail reported eyewitness Carol Miller 's description of the carnage at Edgware Road : `` I saw an old lady who was ripped to pieces , lying between the two trains , '' she said . \nThe Mail reporter added : `` The force of the blast tore bodies apart and amputations were carried out at the scene . '' \nIf disasters are best told in pictures , sometimes words bring home the full horror because they confront you with your own imagination . \nAmong the commentators there was a sharp divide between those prepared to point the finger of blame at the prime minister and the Iraq war , and others who felt it was both inappropriate , with the death toll still mounting , and wrong . \nIn her eerily prescient blog on Thursday afternoon , the Mail 's Melanie Phillips warned of `` something horrible and warped ... lurking just below the surface '' . \nShe was not referring to George Galloway , rather to belief that the Iraq war `` has created more not less terror and that the British would not have been a target at all had we distanced ourselves from the US '' . \nThe columnist continued : `` I expect to see mainstream writers saying as much over the next few days . '' \nIn the event Phillips did not have to wait that long . \nIn the Daily Mirror , Kevin Maguire , risking the ire of many of the tabloid 's readers who thoroughly disliked former editor Piers Morgan 's anti-war stance , asked : `` Was it because of the war in Iraq ? \nThe answers are likely to make uncomfortable reading for Tony Blair ... Responsibility lies firmly with the butchers . \nHowever , when the inquest starts , the Iraq war will also be in the dock . '' \nShoulder to shoulder with Maguire was the former Daily Telegraph and London Evening Standard editor - and military historian - Sir Max Hastings , who wrote : `` We must acknowledge that , by supporting President Bush 's extravagances in his ill-named War on Terror and ill-justified invasion of Iraq , Blair has ensured that we are in the front line beside the US whether we like it or not . '' \nThursday 's events made for some strange bedfellows : the Respect MP George Galloway - branded `` vile '' and `` a traitor '' in the Sun - said much the same thing in the House of Commons . \nIn the Guardian , meanwhile , Robin Cook - an outspoken critic of the Iraq war - urged bridge-building with the moderate Muslim world . \n`` The danger now is that the west 's current response to the terrorist threat compounds the original error , '' he wrote . \n`` So long as the struggle against terrorism is conceived as a war that can be won by military means , it is doomed to fail . '' \nCook is no doubt one of the `` many supple self-deluding figures '' referred to in the Telegraph by Mark Steyn : business as usual by the governing class in the face of terrorism is `` not a stiff upper lip , but a death wish '' , he argued . \n`` This is the beginning of a long existential struggle for Britain and the West . '' \nOnly commentators can afford to be so certain . \nIt was a day in which the number of people visiting news websites soared . \nAs office workers scrambled to find out the latest information , the BBC , Sky News and the Guardian websites reported significantly increased traffic . \nBBC News accounted for 28.6 % of all news page impressions in Britain on Thursday . \nSky News was ranked third , with 3.8 % , and Guardian Unlimited fifth with 2.4 % . \nThe Sun was the eighth most popular news destination , with a 1.4 % share , narrowly behind CNN.com . \nGuardian Unlimited reported that 1.3 million people accessed nearly 8m pages , the most on any one day since the website was launched . \nMore than 500,000 of those users came from the US , while Madrid , scene of the train bombings which killed 191 people in March 2004 , accounted for more visits than any other city apart from London . \nThe US accounted for the highest number of users , with 518,524 . \nThe UK came next with 392,029 , and Canada third with 57,594 . \nSpain accounted for the fourth largest number of visitors , with 35,636 . \nThe busiest period was between 1pm and 2pm : 770,000 pages were viewed on Guardian Unlimited , the equivalent of 213 pages a second . \nOn a typical day , Guardian Unlimited has 3.5m-4m full-page views . \nNews websites accounted for 5.6 % of all online traffic on Thursday , up nearly 50 % on the previous day . \nSky News ' website rose more than 300 places in the overall web rankings to become the 62nd most visited website . \nRatings for the TV news channels were predictably high . \nOn Thursday , Sky News recorded a 4.21 % share of viewing , with BBC News 24 on 2.1 % and the ITV News Channel on 0.6 % . \nAll three news channels were simulcast on terrestrial networks for much of the day : ITV1 was first to switch , taking a rolling service from the ITV News Channel at 10.12 am , which continued uninterrupted until 7pm . \nBBC1 followed suit later , while Five took a feed from Sky News , which was also being simulcasted by Fox News in the US . \nITV seemed keen to re-establish its public service principles , breaking off only for episodes of Emmerdale and The Bill before returning with a two-hour news special fronted by Trevor McDonald from 9pm . \nDespite ITV 's mammoth coverage , viewers turned to the BBC in greater numbers . \nBBC1 's early evening news more than doubled its audience : nearly 7 million viewers watched the specially extended bulletin at 6pm , more than twice the 3.3 million who tuned in at the same time the previous Thursday night . \nAt the same time , 4.4 million were watching ITV 's news coverage . \nThere are few occasions where public relations are as important as in the immediate aftermath of a large scale terrorist attack and the accompanying risk of widespread panic . \nThe Metropolitan Police 's PR department , alongside those of the other emergency services and local government , had long rehearsed for yesterday 's events and , indeed , far worse scenarios . \n`` The eyes of the world are on you at times like this , '' says the Met 's PR chief Dick Fedorcio . \n`` Thursday 's attacks began in the City of London police force area , and early on they asked us to take over the media side for them . \nBefore too long we were dealing with all four attacks . \nI heard the bus blowing up as I walked into the press bureau in Scotland Yard and by then we had already started putting our plan into action . \n`` We took the view very early on that we would need access to a large venue . \nThrough government support we quickly got access to the QE2 conference center which we used for the media . \nAgain , we had planned for that . '' \nThe Met 's deputy assistant commissioner Brian Paddick and the disaster-hardened deputy chief constable of British Transport Police , Andy Trotter , who handled the Paddington rail disaster for the Met , fronted the press conference . \n`` We need to find a senior police figure who is not directly involved in running the operation as we must have access to them round the clock due to the media demands , '' Fedorcio explains . \n`` In a terrorist situation the Met takes the lead over the other emergency services . \nSince September 11 a whole new series of structures were put in place to manage pan-London incidents under the heading London Resilience . \nOur initial objectives are : to convey that we are responding , to demonstrate that we are in control , and to reassure people as best and as early as we can . \nWe also need to be as accurate as possible and not to find ourselves in a position of saying things that turn out to be untrue . '' \nNowhere is that more important or sensitive than when it comes to numbers of casualties . \nSome media executives have expressed frustration at a perceived lack of information in this area : the ITV News editor-in-chief , David Mannion , said he had been called by a Home Office press officer demanding that a newsflash saying that at least 20 people had died be taken down . \n`` I said we would n't take it down , because we 'd got the figure from an authoritative government source , '' he said . \n`` Numbers are very difficult to manage , '' admits Fedorcio . \n`` In the Paddington rail crash there was a carriage we were n't able to get into for several days , but everyone believed a lot of people had got into it . \nIn the event , it turned out there were hardly any bodies in there . \nWhen we have a complete body we will count that , but not before . \nWe 've had to be very careful with the bus and the train at Russell Square because we wo n't have a final figure until we have all the bodies out . '' \nThe bombings were front-page news all over the US print media . \nEditors were quick to stress its context in a war on terror that began for Americans with the attacks on New York and Washington in 2001 . \nMemories of September 11 2001 flooded back : `` The slow realisation of the magnitude of that crime , the nagging worry that we had not seen the end of it ... '' noted an editorial in the New York Times . \nThe New York Post , Rupert Murdoch 's bombastic tabloid , devoted its first 15 pages to graphic photographs of damage and dazed and bloodied survivors , while reports on the `` Massacre by Savages '' stressed Anglo-American unity . \nNoting the `` painful memories of 9\\/11 '' , the Post contrasted Tony Blair 's `` steadfast behavior '' with the `` surprisingly unfocused '' George Bush , and emphasised that the London attacks were another front in the `` war on terror '' being waged in places such as Iraq . \n`` For Britain , it 's 7\\/7 , '' said the Los Angeles Times , stressing the vulnerability of cities in open societies to terrorist attacks . \nPublic transit systems , said the paper , are especially at risk , yet the Bush administration 's efforts to boost security were especially meager . \nThe theme of continued threat at home was taken up by USA Today , America 's only national newspaper . \n`` What 's being done to prevent an attack on my train , or bus , or subway ? '' \nasked an editorial , before concluding , `` the stark reality is , not much '' . \nAmericans , said USA Today , deserved better security . \nBut whereas the US press reaction to 9\\/11 sometimes degenerated into xenophobia , the response to 7\\/7 was more tempered . \nIn contrast , the TV networks , notoriously averse to covering news from abroad , tended to emphasise local angles . \nWhich mostly meant wondering how safe Americans ' mass transit was . \n`` The pace and tone of American TV news , '' noted a commentator in the LA Times , `` have a way of stoking vague fears . '' \nFor real news , it was best to turn to the BBC where the tone of coverage could best be described as `` adult '' . \nLike the other US newspapers , the Washington Post pointed out how new technologies shaped public perception of the London bombings . \nAmericans felt an especial immediacy to events in London when blurry images of footage from the King 's Cross blast aired on their television screens . \nAs USA Today noted , paraphrasing the French response to 9\\/11 , today `` We are all Britons '' . \nPeter Huck in Los Angeles Letters for publication should be sent to : letters@guardian.co.uk If you need help using the site : userhelp@guardian.co.uk Call the main Guardian and Observer switchboard : ` We had 50 images within an hour ' This article appeared on p2 of the Technology Guardian section of the Guardian on 10.58 BST on Monday 11 July 2005 \n"}
{"id": "246", "time": "2005-08-05", "text": "Commanders weigh their options as ` Juba ' notches up more kills Friday 5 August 2005 00.01 BST They have never seen Juba . \nThey hear him , but by then it 's too late : a shot rings out and another US soldier slumps dead or wounded . \nThere is never a follow-up shot , never a chance for US forces to identify the origin , to make the hunter the hunted . \nHe fires once and vanishes . \nJuba is the nickname given by American forces to an insurgent sniper operating in southern Baghdad . \nThey do not know his appearance , nationality or real name , but they know and fear his skill . \n`` He 's good , '' said Specialist Travis Burress , 22 , a sniper with the 1-64 battalion based in Camp Rustamiyah . \n`` Every time we dismount I 'm sure everyone has got him in the back of their minds . \nHe 's a serious threat to us . '' \nGun attacks occasionally pepper the battalion 's foot and mounted patrols , but the single crack of what is thought to be a Tobuk sniper rifle inspires particular dread . \nSince February , the killing of at least two members of the battalion and the wounding of six more have been attributed to Juba . \nSome think it is also he that has picked off up to a dozen other soldiers . \nIn a war marked by sectarian bombings and civilian casualties , Juba is unusual in targeting only coalition troops , a difficult quarry protected by armored vehicles , body armor and helmets . \nHe waits for soldiers to dismount , or stand up in a Humvee turret , and aims for gaps in their body armor , the lower spine , ribs or above the chest . \nHe has killed from 200 metres away . \n`` It was the perfect shot , '' the battalion commander , Lt Col Kevin Farrell , said of one incident . \n`` Blew out the spine . \n`` We have different techniques to try to lure him out , but he is very well trained and very patient . \nHe does n't fire a second shot . '' \nSome in the battalion want marksmen to occupy rooftops overlooking supply routes , Juba 's hunting ground , to try to put him in the cross-hairs . \n`` It would be a pretty shitty assignment because he 's good , '' said Spc Burress . \n`` I think it 's a sniper 's job to get a sniper , and it 'd probably take all of us to get him . '' \nAmerican snipers operate in teams of at least two people , a shooter and a spotter , the latter requiring more experience since he must use complicated formulae to calculate factors such as wind strength and drag coefficients . \nSome worry that Juba is on his way to becoming a resistance hero , acclaimed by those Iraqis who distinguish between `` good '' insurgents , who target only Americans , and `` bad '' insurgents who harm civilians . \nThe insurgent grapevine celebrates an incident last June when a four-strong marine scout sniper team was killed in Ramadi , all with shots to the head . \nUnlike their opponents , US snipers in Baghdad seldom get to shoot . \nTypically they hide on rooftops and use thermal imaging and night vision equipment to monitor areas . \nIf there is suspicious activity , they summon aircraft or ground patrols . \n`` We are professionals . \nThere is a line between a maniac with a gun and a sniper , '' said Mike , 31 , a corporal with a reconnaissance sniper platoon who did not want to his surname to be used . \nHe spoke during a 24-hour mission on a roof during which his team ate junk food and urinated into a bottle . \nDuring daylight they lay on the ground , immobile , to avoid being seen . \n`` It 's not a glamorous life , '' he said . \nThere was no sign of Juba , who tended to operate further east , but the team spotted mortar flashes and fed the coordinates to base . \nMike said he had shot 14 people in Somalia , three in Afghanistan and one in Iraq . \n`` It 's not like you expect it to be , an emotional high . \nYou just think about the wind , the range , then it 's over with . '' \nSniper fire is only of the threats for an American military that has suffered heavy losses this week . \nYesterday another soldier was killed in Ramadi , west of Baghdad , adding to the 21 who died in attacks on Monday and Wednesday . \nRoadside bombs account for most of the lives lost , and the size and design of the explosions has led investigators to conclude that the insurgents are learning bombmaking methods from other terrorist organizations . \nYesterday 's New York Times reported that the techniques used by Hezbollah in Lebanon were increasingly being seen in roadside bombs in Iraq . \nAn unnamed senior American commander quoted by the paper said bombs using shaped charges closely matched the bombs that Hezbollah used against Israel . \n`` Our assessment is that they are probably going off to ` school ' to learn how to make bombs that can destroy armored vehicles , '' he said . \n"}
{"id": "93", "time": "2005-10-09", "text": "Liberals will blame anybody else for atrocities rather than accuse murderous Islamic terrorists There are plenty of signs that Paris could be next . \nFrench intelligence agents found a message on an Arabic website from the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat , a demented Algerian outfit which is close to al-Qaeda . \nFrance was ` our first enemy ' , the terrorists said . \nThe ` only way to discipline France is jihad , martyrdom and Islam ' . \nAt the end of last month , French police arrested nine alleged Islamists in a suburb of Paris and claimed they were planning to bomb the Metro . \nNicolas Sarkozy , the French Interior minister , said the risk of an attack was currently ` at a very high level ' . \nMarc Hecker , from the French Institute for International Relations , said it was ' a real error ' to believe that France would be left in peace because President Chirac opposed the Iraq War . \nBut as it 's impossible to blame Iraq , what or who will get the blame if the rucksacks start exploding at the Gare du Nord ? \nWill the liberal world look Islamism in the face and see a cult of slaughter and self-slaughter powered by messianic faith , the Jewish conspiracy theory of European fascism , imperialist dreams of world domination and a loathing of democracy , pluralism , religious tolerance and the emancipation of women ? \nI live in hope , but the record suggests everyone but the perpetrators will be held responsible . \nIf the French ca n't be blamed for their part in the downfall of Chirac 's old friend , Saddam Hussein , then maybe their support for the Algerian government will be used to explain the killings . \nHow about the ban of headscarves in French schools ? \nMy money is on the headscarves but , frankly , the favored ` root cause ' could be the effect of the Common Agricultural Policy on poor world farmers or the provocation given by bikini-wearing holidaymakers at Club Med resorts in North Africa or the behavior of French paratroopers during the Algerian War of Independence in the 1950s . \nIf you think I 'm exaggerating , consider the attempts to show that the bombs in Bali were the fault of liberal democracies . \nBefore a single fact on the motives of the killers was available , the Independent on Sunday declared : ` There can be little doubt that the bombs in Bali are linked to issues surrounding the war . \nIt is no coincidence that Australia , whose citizens are likely to be the majority of the victims , is fully committed in Iraq . ' \nActually , there could be a great deal of doubt , not least because the majority of the dead were Indonesian Hindus , who I assume the Islamists were happy to designate as pagans before murdering them . \nPamela Nowicka of Tourism Concern , which campaigns for eco-friendly holidays , had doubts of her own . \nShe decided that what mattered was that the dead tourists were tourists rather than Australians . \n` Many in the global south regard tourism as a new form of colonialism and cultural imperialism , ' she wrote in the Guardian . \n` While that may be hard for the suntanned holidaymaker to take on board , for the millions of ordinary people servicing their needs - the waiting staff , room cleaners , receptionists , shop workers , guides , massage ladies and taxi drivers - the linkage is clearer . ' \nExcept that the bombers were n't disgruntled room cleaners and taxi drivers . \nThey were members of a totalitarian movement which is against every principle Ms Nowicka professes to support . \nThe first economic consequence of their killings will be to put cleaners and taxi drivers out of work . \nI could go on - Mark Curtis , a historian from the Noam Chomsky school , wrote a piece which blamed the bombs on British support for General Suharto 's coup a mere 40 years ago - but what needs saying is that no mainstream commentator mentioned that we have the grievance of Indonesian Islamists on the record . \nIt has nothing to do with the foreign policy of the first Wilson administration or stingy tipping in Bali 's restaurants . \nAfter the 2002 explosions in Bali killed 200 , Osama bin Laden declared : ` Australia is the one that we have warned before not to participate in Afghanistan , not to mention its continued awful chapter in East Timor . \nThey ignored our warning and they woke up to the sound of explosions in Bali . ' \nMy guess is that people do n't want to look at al-Qaeda 's condemnations of Australia 's role in saving -LRB- largely Catholic -RRB- East Timor from destruction by the militias of -LRB- largely Muslim -RRB- Indonesia . \nIt 's too frightening to contemplate ; it takes you into the darkness to confront Islamism 's impossible and therefore unappeasable demand for a caliphate and reminds you of its imperial urge to dominate Muslims and subjugate all others . \nAvoidance of what al-Qaeda stands for began in 9\\/11 and has become endemic since . \nMy favorite piece of victim blaming was after the Madrid bombings . \nFor a few hours , there was a rumor that they were the work of ETA and Eddie Mair , the presenter of Radio 4 's PM news show , duly had a go at a representative of the Spanish government , alleging that Madrid 's refusal to talk to Basque nationalists was the root cause of the atrocity . \nBy the next day , it was clear that Islamists , not Basques , had attacked Madrid . \nWithout pausing for breath , Mair duly wanted to know if the presence of Spanish troops in Iraq was the root cause of the atrocity . \nThe identity of the bombers was irrelevant . \nThe Spanish had to be the cause of their own suffering . \nPerhaps it is too easy to mock . \nWhen confronted with an ideology which mandates indiscriminate killing on an industrial scale , it is natural to seek rational explanations of the irrational ; to pretend that Islamism is merely a reasonable , if bloody , response to legitimate concerns which could be remedied if we elected wiser leaders . \nYet the masochism - ` Kill us , we deserve it ! ' \n- the subliminal dislike of democracy and the willingness to turn al-Qaeda into the armed wing of every fashionable campaign from sustainable tourism to the anti-war movement will in the end disgrace the liberals by making them ridiculous . \nCharles Clarke should learn that clarity does n't begin at Home The Home Office is attempting the revolutionary tactic of treating the British public as adults . \nThis may be foolish . \nThe only adult thing about millions of British voters is that they are over 18 . \nNone the less , it was cheering to see Charles Clarke publish vast amounts of supporting evidence last week to explain why he wanted to hold suspects without charge for three months . \nFor years now , the government has felt no need to justify its assaults on civil liberties . \nIt has simply dismissed its critics as ` BMW-driving , civil-liberties lawyers ' and other decadent dilettantes . \nThe act of writing out a justification destroys self-delusion by forcing you to be clear . \nI 'm not sure if it will help sell other Home Office policies . \nHow would an honest description of its ban on the incitement to religious hatred read ? \n` We are so worried about religious extremists that we want to give them the chance to send their critics to prison . ' \nA bit windy , perhaps . \nLet 's try : ` We 'll fight religious bigotry by protecting religious bigotry . ' \nNearer the mark , I think , and more succinct . \nOn identity cards , intellectual clarity would demand that Mr Clarke begins : ` We 're so worried by crime , terrorism and illegal immigration that we want to impose a new law-and-order tax on the public . \nOur estimate is it will raise # 6 billion . \nOthers say # 18bn . \nLet 's split the difference and call it # 12bn . \nNow we wo n't spend it on capturing criminals , terrorists and illegal immigrants . \nThat would be mad . \nRather than wasting money on new police officers , we will force people who are n't criminals , terrorists and illegal immigrants to carry an expensive piece of plastic . ' \nDoes it work for you ? \nI do n't think the new openness will last . \nAs a true friend of the Home Office , I advise it to go back to its traditional policy of always complain , never explain . \n"}

'' \nMr McClellan admitted he was not at the Israeli-Palestinian summit at the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh in June 2003 when Mr Bush supposedly revealed the extent of his religious fervor . \nHowever , he said he had checked into the claims and `` I stand by what I just said '' . \nAsked if Mr Bush had ever mentioned that God had ordered him into Afghanistan and Iraq , Mr McClellan said : `` No , and I 've been in many meetings with him and never heard such a thing . '' \nThe claims are due to be broadcast in a three-part BBC documentary which analyses attempts to bring peace to the Middle East . \nMr Shaath , the Palestinian foreign minister in 2003 , claims Mr Bush told him and other delegates that he was spoken to by God over his plans for war . \nHe told the film-makers : `` President Bush said to all of us : ` I 'm driven with a mission from God . \nGod would tell me , George , go and fight those terrorists in Afghanistan . \nAnd I did , and then God would tell me , George , go and end the tyranny in Iraq ... And I did . '' \n` And now , again , I feel God 's words coming to me , Go get the Palestinians their state and get the Israelis their security , and get peace in the Middle East . \nAnd by God I 'm gonna do it . ' '' \nThe Palestinian leader , Mahmoud Abbas , who attended the June 2003 meeting as well , also appears on the documentary series to recount how Mr Bush told him : `` I have a moral and religious obligation . \nSo I will get you a Palestinian state . '' \nMr Bush , who became a born-again Christian at 40 , is one of the most overtly religious leaders to occupy the White House , a fact that brings him much support in middle America . \n`` History is littered with examples of people doing the most bizarre and sometimes wicked things on this basis , '' said Andrew Blackstock , director of the British-based Christian Socialist Movement . \n`` If Bush really wants to obey God during his time as president he should start with what is blindingly obvious from the Bible rather than perceived supernatural messages . \n`` That would lead him to the rather less glamorous business of prioritising the needs of the poor , the downtrodden and the marginalised in his own country and abroad . \n`` When we see more policies reflecting that , it might be easier to believe he has God on his side . \nAnd more likely that God might speak to him . '' \nThe TV series , which starts on Monday , charts recent attempts to bring peace to the Middle East , from the former US president Bill Clinton 's peace talks in 1999-2000 , to Israel 's withdrawal from the Gaza Strip this year . \nIt seeks to uncover what happened behind closed doors by speaking to presidents and prime ministers , along with their generals and ministers , the BBC said . \n"}

'' \nMr Shaath 's comments came as Mr Bush delivered a speech yesterday aimed at bolstering US support for the Iraq war . \nHe revealed that the US and its partners had disrupted at least 10 serious al-Qaida plots since September 11 , including three planned attacks in the US . \n`` Because of this steady progress , the enemy is wounded - but the enemy is still capable of global operations , '' he said . \nHe added that Islamic radicals had used a series of excuses to justify their attacks , from conflict with the Israelis to the Crusades 1,000 years ago . \n`` We 're facing a radical ideology with unalterable objectives : to enslave whole nations and intimidate the world , '' he said . \nHe conceded that al-Qaida , led in Iraq by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi , and other insurgents had gained ground in Iraq but the US would not leave until security had been established . \n`` Some observers also claim that America would be better off by cutting our losses and leaving Iraq now . \nThis is a dangerous illusion , refuted with a simple question : Would the United States and other free nations be more safe , or less safe , with Zarqawi and Bin Laden in control of Iraq , its people , and its resources ?

{"id": "24", "time": "2005-03-20", "text": "Johnson Beharry was last week awarded the Victoria Cross for his acts of bravery during the Iraq war . \nPeter Beaumont and Jason Burke ask what factors - physical , psychological and moral - create a heroic act The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Sunday March 27 , 2005 In the article below we said Colonel Herbert ` H ' Jones and Sergeant Ian McKay were awarded the VC for their role in the attack on Goose Green . \nIn fact , Sergeant McKay 's VC was awarded for his bravery during an attack on an enemy position on Mount Longdon , an objective in the battle for Port Stanley . \n` Heroism ' , wrote Ralph Waldo Emerson , ` is an obedience to a secret impulse of an individual 's character . ' \nIt is a mystery , war 's great enigma - what is it that makes one man run , another stand his ground , and an exceptional few display unusual courage . \nThat conundrum - of what makes a hero - was posed again last week as a young Grenadan-born private from the 1st Battalion of The Princess of Wales 's Royal Regiment , Johnson Beharry , was presented with the Victoria Cross , Britain 's highest award for military gallantry , for the bravery he showed in two separate actions in Iraq last year . \nHe is only the 1,354 th recipient since the medal was instituted in 1854 - and only the 11th since the end of the Second World War . \nAnd what underlies that question of heroism is not simply the details of his extraordinary valor as they were detailed last week , but by the pictures of Beharry himself . \nThey showed an open , easy and smiling face - comfortable , perhaps even a little shy - reinforcing his humanity . \nThey were pictures that insisted that we ask : what was it that made this ordinary man do such extraordinary things ? \nIt is a question , in truth , as old as writing and humanity itself - and one that only now scientists are beginning to understand . \nHomer took it as his theme in the Iliad , his depiction of the characters of two great and flawed warriors - Achilles and Hector - while Plato and Aristotle dissected what it meant for the citizen soldier . \nThe Old Testament authors presented their own archetypes for heroism , none more powerfully described than David 's struggle against Goliath . \nIn the last century , however , biologists and social scientists , physiologists and psychologists began to attempt to define Emerson 's ` secret impulse ' and the core nature of heroism itself . \nIt is a question that has been muddied by the fact that the idea of heroism at any time is defined by broader social values and shifting cultural perceptions . \nThe traditional meaning that accrued to it in the field of military endeavor was , perhaps , best expressed by Churchill 's physician , Lord Moran , who took two views of courage in his book , The Anatomy of Courage - as a ` true virtue ' , and as a special case of self-control . \nHe rejected , too , the idea of courage as a constant . \nInstead he took the view that it was inevitably exhaustible . \nMost of all , believed Moran , it had to involve a conscious decision . \n` Courage is a moral quality , ' wrote Lord Moran . \n` It is not a chance gift of nature like an aptitude for games . \nIt is a cold choice between two alternatives , the fixed resolve not to quit ; an act of renunciation which must be made not once but many times by the power of the will . ' \nIt is a definition that could have been written for Johnson Beharry . \nThe story of Beharry 's heroism , however , is doubly meaningful because his story transcends the traditional idea of martial valor - that its function is violence alone - and incorporates more modern civil notions that real heroes are just those ordinary people who put themselves at risk to help others . \nThe 24-year-old armored vehicle driver was at the head of a five-vehicle convoy that came under attack on the outskirts of the central Iraqi city of Amara on the night of 1 May last year . \nThe vehicle Beharry was driving was hit by a barrage of rocket-propelled grenades , leaving the platoon commanding officer unconscious and presumed dead , and engulfing the vehicle in flames . \nBeharry , determined to get the casualties to safety and create a path for the other vehicles to follow , rammed a barricade and drove on through thick smoke and a mile-long ambush with his protective hatch blasted open . \nHe eventually delivered the troops to a secure area , twice returning to the vehicle under fire to carry the wounded inside a compound . \nWeeks later , his Warrior was ambushed again and a rocket exploded six inches away from him , causing serious head injuries . \nHe managed to reverse the Warrior and its occupants out of danger before collapsing into a coma . \nThey were actions that meant Beharry would become the first living recipient of a Victoria Cross -LRB- VC -RRB- since 1965 , and the first to get the medal since the 1982 Falklands conflict when Colonel Herbert ` H ' Jones and Sergeant Ian McKay were awarded the VC posthumously for their role in the attack on Goose Green . \nIndeed , military experts believe that the award of the VC to Beharry signalled a recognition of the change in the army 's role . \n` For a long time the feeling was that the Victoria Cross should be reserved for gallantry in conventional war rather than the `` low-intensity conflicts '' that the British Army has primarily been involved in recently , ' said Andrew Dorman , a lecturer in Defense Studies at King 's College London . \nDorman said last week 's VC showed a recognition both that ` extreme gallantry is the same whatever ' , a belief recognized by Beharry 's fellow soldiers , who launched the campaign for him to be given the Victoria Cross after senior officers recommended him for honors . \nBut was there something in Beharry 's background that conditioned him for courage ? \nThe son of a Grenadan brickmaker who came to the United Kingdom in 1999 , Johnson grew up in a wooden hut without running water that he shared with his parents and seven brothers and sisters . \nIn interviews last week , his parents said that Johnson , who had enjoyed playing childhood war-games with his friends , had always dreamed of joining the British Army , leaving school at 14 . \nBeharry 's modest upbringing is one that he shares with other soldiers who have displayed the highest gallantry in war , including Audie Murphy , America 's most decorated soldier of World War Two , whose parents were dirt-poor sharecroppers , and Albert Jacka VC , the Australian hero of Gallipoli , a forestry labourer who rose rapidly through the ranks . \nYet none of this explains why some people are predisposed to be courageous , and in a way the majority are not . \nThis question has obsessed military commanders from the first decade of the last century onwards as they enlisted the new social sciences to try to find ways of persuading soldiers to be more aggressive - courageous in the traditional military sense . \nIt is the search for the roots of courage that was chronicled by Joanna Bourke of Birkbeck College in her book An Intimate History of Killing . \n` There was a problem : the instinct of self-preservation was as liable to lead to `` flight '' as to `` fight '' , ' wrote Bourke about the early attempts to understand valor . \n` To overcome this , military psychologists coupled instinct theory with the crowd psychology of men like Gustave Le Bon and his English populariser , Wilfred Trotter . \n` Humans were herd animals , with strong gregarious impulses . \nIn a crowd - and the army was only a trained crowd - the `` group mind '' would take over , endowing the individual with a sense of almost limitless power and immortality . ' \nThat was the theory for a while at least . \nBut it still did not explain why some soldiers were prepared to take more risks than others . \nBy the Fifties , research was hinting at other explanations . \nThe British psychologist , Hans Eysenck , developed a scale to measure the personality trait of extroversion , now regarded by psychologists as one of the most consistent predictors of risk-taking . \nOther physical studies , meanwhile , were beginning to reveal that the brain not only craved arousal , but somehow could regulate that arousal at an optimal level . \nOver the next three decades , researchers extended these early findings into a host of theories about risk-taking . \nIt led scientists , including Frank Farley in the US , to identify risk-takers as a whole new ` personality type ' - Type-A - which he subdivided into T-negative and T-positive , to distinguish between productive and destructive risk-taking : between the heroic tendency and the nihilistic . \nBiologists too were making critical breakthroughs in explaining those predisposed to risk-taking behavior , discovering the action of an enzyme called monoamine oxidase -LRB- MAO -RRB- in regulating arousal in the brain , with scientists discovering low levels of the enzyme in the brains of those dubbed High Sensation Seekers . \nAll of which suggests that military courage , of the kind understood by Moran , is a deeply complex coincidence of the physical , social and the moral ; of nature and nurture ; of instinct and that which is learned . \nBut for all the mystery of what courage is and where it comes from , one thing about it is immutable : it is the use of valor to reinforce what a society feels about its values , from Homer 's celebration of the valor of Greek and Trojan warriors , to Australia 's lionisation of Albert Jacka and the mythologising in the public mind of Colonel Herbert ` H ' Jones . \nThe soldier 's story is being seen as a magnificent public relations opportunity for the army , which has been hit by scandals involving the abuse and death of recruits at Deepcut Barracks and the mistreatment of prisoners in Iraq . \nThough the army is only 500 men below its ideal strength of 104,000 , an initial surge in recruitment that followed the war in Iraq has now fallen away and , as is usual after a war , experienced soldiers are leaving . \n` Beharry was incredibly brave , incredibly competent and incredibly committed . \nHis story is a great advertisement for today 's army and everyone 's very pleased about that , ' one retired senior officer told The Observer . \nAnd Beharry 's heroism can help in other ways . \nThe forces have made repeated efforts to reach out to minorities . \nLast week the head of Britain 's armed forces made a direct appeal to the country 's Islamic community to encourage more Muslims to join up . \nGeneral Sir Michael Walker , the chief of defense staff , said he was personally committed to ` creating armed forces which reflect more fully the society we serve ' . \nBeharry , his great smiling face appearing on the front of newspapers , can mean far more to the creation of an image of the army as a diverse organization than any set of new statistics or new policies . \nFor the soldiers themselves it is a different state of affairs . \nFor them heroism is best summed up by the speech of Clearchos to his soldiers in Xenophon 's Anabasis . ' \nI will go with you and suffer whatever I must suffer . \nFor I consider that you are my country and my friends and comrades ; and with you , I think I shall be honored wherever I may be , but without you I think I am not able either to help a friend or hurt an enemy . \nWhere you go , there I will go also : that is my resolve .

'' \nPte Beharry had no means of communication with the turret crew or any of the other Warriors around him . \nHe did not know if his commander or crew were still alive or how serious their injuries were . \n`` On his own initiative , he closed his driver 's hatch and moved forward through the ambush position to try to establish some form of communications , halting just short of a barricade across the road . '' \nThe Warrior was hit again by RPGs . \nIt caught fire and filled with thick , noxious smoke . \nPte Beharry , continues the citation , `` assessed that his best course of action to save the lives of his crew was to push through , out of the ambush . \nHe drove his Warrior directly through the barricade , not knowing if there were mines or improvised explosive devices placed there to destroy his vehicle . \nBy doing this he was able to lead the remaining five Warriors behind him towards safety . '' \nAnother RPG hit the Warrior . \n`` The flames and force of the blast passed directly over him , down the driver 's tunnel , further wounding the semi-conscious gunner in the turret . '' \nPte Beharry was `` forced to drive the vehicle along the rest of the ambushed route , some 1,500 metres , with his hatch opened up and his head exposed to enemy fire , all the time with no communications with any other vehicle . '' \nA 7.62 mm bullet penetrated his helmet and remained lodged on its inner surface . \nPte Beharry then climbed on to the turret of the burning vehicle and , `` seemingly oblivious to the incoming enemy small arms fire , manhandled his wounded platoon commander out of the turret , off the vehicle and to the safety of a nearby Warrior '' . \nRemounting his burning vehicle for the third time , he drove it through `` a complex chicane and into the security of the defended perimeter of the outpost , thus denying it to the enemy '' . \nOnce inside , he collapsed from physical and mental exhaustion . \nA few weeks later , on June 11 , another Warrior convoy he was leading was ambushed . \nA grenade detonated six inches from his head . \n`` With the blood from his head injury obscuring his vision , Beharry managed to continue to control his vehicle and forcefully reversed the Warrior out of the ambush , '' says the citation . \nHe then collapsed , unconscious . \nThe Grenada-born private was paraded by the top brass yesterday among his comrades in the 1st Battalion , the Princess of Wales 's Royal Regiment , and other recipients of high military honors . \n`` I was just doing my job . \nI was just thinking of the guys in the vehicle and the guys behind me , '' he said . \nHe was asked what was going through his mind at the time . \n`` An RPG '' , Pte Beharry promptly replied . \nHe was not afraid at the time , only afterwards . \nAsked why he had left Grenada , he said he wanted `` a change of life '' . \nAsked if he would be Britain 's first black general , he quickly replied : `` No. '' His wife Lynthia said that after he had been injured he was told he had only a 50-50 chance of surviving . \nShe said her husband would return to Iraq `` if he has to '' . \nPte Beharry 's award was described by Gary Sheffield , a leading historian of the modern British army , as `` a classic in the VC mould - he was rescuing colleagues '' . \nHe added : `` It is also testimony of what a nasty war is going on in Iraq . '' \nLieutenant Colonel Matt Maer , Pte Beharry 's commanding officer , described yesterday how his troops were in action every day for five months , more than 800 times in all . \nIt was the longest period of continuous combat experienced by the British army since the Korean war 50 years ago . \nThe soldiers were repeatedly attacked by Mahdi militia , supporters of the radical Shia cleric , Moqtada al-Sadr . \nHe said 40 of his soldiers were wounded and three killed from his battlegroup of about 1,300 . \nBritish military sources who experienced the action say they do not know how many Iraqis were killed , but add that hundreds would be an exaggeration . \n"}

divorce by `` talaq '' -LRB- when a husband has only to declare `` I divorce you '' three times for the marriage to be at an end -RRB- ; honor killings ; stoning and public beheadings of women for alleged adultery . \nBut now rule 137 's provisions are back in the new draft constitution . \nDespite the appalling security situation in Iraq -LRB- two Sunni members of the committee who are drafting the constitution were gunned down last week -RRB- , thousands of brave Iraqi women , from different governorates , risked their lives last Tuesday when they congregated in Baghdad 's Al-Firdaws Square to protest against their exclusion in the draft constitution . \nThe international press , busy reporting the continuing violence of the insurgency , failed to cover this event and it got little publicity within Iraq . \nAt one point in the rally , a small group of women arrived to mount their own demonstration - shouting slogans demanding that the Qur ` an be the sole source of law in the constitution . \nTheir curious presence illustrates neatly the additional fear that even if 25 % of the membership of all decision-making bodies , including the national assembly , are reserved for women , some will be little more than puppets , put forward by those very parties that believe that women 's place is not in politics , but subservient to men and in the home . \n-LRB- The 25 % quota was included in the interim constitution thanks to the laudable efforts of Sir Jeremy Greenstock when he was our man in Baghdad in 2004 , but it is only to be followed for the next two elections . \nAfter that the quota will lapse . -RRB- \nThe drafts released last weekend are a cause for deepest concern . \nWritten by a committe of 46 men and nine women , they expressly state that the main source of legislation in the new Iraqi constitution is to be sharia law , which will take precedence over international law . \nSharia law decrees that `` personal status '' -LRB- that is , family law relating to marriage , divorce , custody , widowhood and inheritance -RRB- is to be determined according to the different religious sects . \nDepriving women of their long-held rights and rendering them subservient to interpretations of Islamic law could well lead to the `` Talibanisation '' of Iraq and an escalation of violence towards women who rebel . \nIndeed extremists and insurgents are already using rape , acid attacks and violence to force women to wear the veil . \nNow a law is set to be passed that will ban widows from working for three months following the deaths of their husbands . \nThese developments have caused deep dismay among women 's organizations across Iraq , whether Kurds , Sunnis or Shias . \nIraqi women have campaigned and lobbied hard over the past few months , often risking great personal danger - several politically active women have been assassinated , abducted , raped or threatened - for the new constitution to guarantee women 's rights and abide by international treaties . \nWhat can be done to ensure that women 's voices are heard ? \nConferences , workshops , rallies and seminars seem to have no effect . \nAt a meeting in Jordan only three weeks ago , at an undisclosed location for reasons of security , men and women from the Constitutional Drafting Committee and the Transitional Assembly vigorously discussed the issue of women 's rights . \nBut already it seemed clear that it would be impossible to arrive at any consensus by the August 15 deadline , whether about women 's rights , or about federalism , the place of international conventions , or such basic principles as the right to life . \n`` Leave that till we have hung Saddam , '' commented one national assembly member . \nAnother , in a formal speech , remarked , `` If we had 30 % of women in our national assembly we would never get anything done '' , and offered the suggestion : `` Husbands should be able to punish their wives , providing that they leave no mark of injury . '' \nThe majority of participants voted for a postponement - and a postponement of six months is permitted . \nBut the Bush administration would clearly like to see all the deadlines , for the constitution , referendum and next election , met so that it can withdraw US troops from Iraq . \nBut delivering a constitution that so flagrantly breaches all international laws on human rights and equality , and is so totally discriminatory of , and unacceptable to , the vast majority of Iraqi women , is not acceptable in the name of `` democracy '' . \nIf Iraq is truly to become a democratic state , complying with international human rights treaties and conventions , then its constitution , while upholding sharia law , must ensure that its interpretation does not breach its international obligations . \nIt is unprecedented to rush the writing of a document as important as a constitution , because once written , it will determine the future of the country and the lives of its people . \nCivil society , both male and female , must be consulted . \nBut the present state of near civil war is not the best time to take soundings , or educate and inform the population on the meaning of a constitution , and its importance for their future - another reason surely for a postponement . \nEvery day in Iraq , women are beaten , raped , abducted and murdered in `` honor killings '' . \nMillions more live in poverty and fear . \nThe new constitution must uphold their rights , for we know that it is only when women have equality with men that there can be true democracy , justice and peace . \nIraqi women are imploring the international community to act to protect the lives of 13 million women . \nTony Blair and Jack Straw must not remain silent . \nMargaret Owen is the head of Widows for Peace through Democracy and a member of the UK Bar Human Rights Committee Letters for publication should be sent to : letters@guardian.co.uk If you need help using the site : userhelp@guardian.co.uk Call the main Guardian and Observer switchboard : Women 's rights in Iraq 's draft constitution This article appeared on p16 of the G2 section of the Guardian on 11.43 BST on Thursday 28 July 2005 . \n"}

\nThere is no Lab\\/LD swing which can lead to the Conservatives winning an overall majority . \nAnd besides , Mr Blair promised to introduce PR in the 1997 manifesto . \n8 years later he 's using the unfairnes of FPTP to frighten people into voting Labor . \nDo n't blame the system you promised to reform , Mr Blair , you 've had 8 years to change it ! \nPosted by Garry on May 1 , 2005 09:36 PM . \nBefore you put full faith in that argument , you might like to ask yourself why they covered something like 30 scenarios , but not one in which the tory percentage vote was as far from the poll value as it has been in every single one of the last half-dozen or so elections . \nWhile it is theoretically possible they are right , it would be unprecedented in modern politics . \nPosted by Garry on May 2 , 2005 12:53 AM . \nThis is not about the election but the article `` It 's official : Acupuncture really works '' , which would be hilarious if it was n't so depressing . \nSuggestion and qualification being presented as proof , depressing stuff . \nWe 're only told that genuine acupuncture created brain activity - the author does n't even bother to state which , if any , of the control groups displayerd a universal improvement in their symptoms . \nProbably because none did , which would demonstrate -LRB- again -RRB- that acupuncture is pure quackery -RRB- . \nIt does n't take a genius to notice that all the -LRB- stress induced -RRB- illnesses listed as being treated by acupuncture come straight after we 're shown the amateur psychiatry associated with the `` treatment '' . \nA pathetic article masquerading as Health\\/Science in an otherwise intelligent newspaper . \nPosted by Daniel Sexton on May 2 , 2005 07:54 PM . \nI think it is great the Observer opens its pages to its readers and discovers that some live in a greater fantasy world than some of its political commentators . \nMy mind goes out to the words of Nixon who said something along the lines of `` it ca n't be illegal if the President of the United States does it . '' \nHave these people not been elected to rule this county and does n't that allow them to lead us in to war anytime they want for any reason they want ? \nDo we believe in giving men power and then tripping them up when they try and make decisions that we -LRB- and that includes me , if you must know -RRB- do n't approve of ? \nAnd what about all the smarmy knockers who say `` it is all about oil . '' \nWe live in a world dominated by oil . \nThe world we know and enjoy is spun around it . \nWho knows what will happened when the stuff starts running out and prices go through the roof ? \nIs this country going to start riding bikes or start throwing bricks ? \nBlair has n't done a bad job for this country and it is right that he should be re-elected . \nThe initial public love affair was never going to last - but I think his record is quite respectable and will probably be viewed more kindly when he calls it a day . \nPosted by Peter Hayes on May 3 , 2005 05:17 PM . \nthe party party - George Bush sampled in funky mp3 mash-up jam . \nSublime subversion ... openDemocracy - Independent , free , free-thinking . \nGotta be a good thing ...

{"id": "299", "time": "2005-04-30", "text": "Saturday 30 April 2005 02.22 BST Sudan 's Islamist regime , once shunned by Washington for providing a haven for Osama bin Laden as well as for human rights abuses during decades of civil war , has become an ally in the Bush administration 's `` war on terror '' . \nOnly months after the US accused Khartoum of carrying out genocide in Darfur , Sudan has become a crucial intelligence asset to the CIA . \nIn the Middle East and Africa , Sudan 's agents have penetrated networks that would not normally be accessible to America , one former US intelligence official told the Guardian . \nSome of that cooperation has spilled over into the war in Iraq : Sudan is credited with detaining foreign militants on their way to join anti-American fighters there . \nSudanese agents have also helped the CIA to monitor Islamist organizations in Somalia . \n`` The intelligence relationship is the strongest thread between Washington and Khartoum , '' the official said . \n`` Khartoum is probably the only government in the Arab League that has contributed in a major way to the protection of US forces and citizens in Iraq . '' \nNews of the growing cooperation was first reported in yes terday 's Los Angeles Times . \nThe paper traced the thaw in relations since 2001 to a milestone last week : the visit to Washington by Sudan 's intelligence chief , Salah Abdallah Gosh . \nIt reported that Sudan 's secret police had begun to crack down on suspected Islamists , had shared evidence with the FBI and allowed US personnel to interrogate al-Qaida suspects . \nIn May 2003 , Sudanese security forces raided a suspected terrorist training camp and deported more than a dozen , mainly Saudi , militants to Arab states which work closely with US intelligence services , the newspaper said . \nYet a decade ago Sudan was a haven to Bin Laden and other international outlaws , such as Carlos the Jackal . \nIn 1993 , it was placed on the US state department 's list of terrorist regimes . \nApproaches from Khartoum were rebuffed - even as it offered its services against an emerging al-Qaida in the 1990s . \n`` Sudan tried to hand over two guys implicated in the 1998 bombing of the US embassies in east Africa , and the response was to send cruise missiles to hit the aspirin factory in Khartoum , '' the official said . \n`` They offered up Bin Laden in 1995 , and we said we do n't even have an indictment on him . '' \nOfficially , Washington 's position towards Sudan remains unchanged . \n`` Sudan is still considered a state sponsor of terror , '' a state department spokesman said yesterday . \nNews of General Gosh 's visit to Washington caused consternation in human rights circles . \nThe general is among 51 Sudanese officials implicated in human rights abuses by the international criminal court . \n`` I quite understand that the war on terrorism means dealing with bad actors , but to fly in one of Sudan 's chief committers of what Washington has formally described as genocide is deeply disturbing , '' said an independent Sudan analyst , Eric Reeves . \nHe noted there had been signs of a slight thaw towards Khartoum for some time - despite the state department 's official stance . \n"}
{"id": "262", "time": "2005-03-11", "text": "Friday 11 March 2005 01.52 GMT Experts in public health from six countries , including the UK , today castigate the British and American governments for failing to investigate the deaths of civilians caught up in the conflict in Iraq . \nTwenty-four experts from the UK , the US , Australia , Canada , Spain and Italy say the attitude of the governments is `` wholly irresponsible '' . \nThey say the UK government 's reliance on `` extremely limited data '' from the Iraqi ministry of health is `` unacceptable '' because it is likely to seriously underestimate the casualties . \nTheir hard-hitting statement , published online by the British Medical Journal , comes nearly five months after the Lancet published a household survey of civilian deaths in Iraq which estimated that about 100,000 civilians had died - most of them women and children . \nThe study caused controversy and was dismissed by the British government as unreliable , partly because the authors admitted that , under the difficult circumstances , it could not be precise . \nThe experts lambast the government for criticising the data without conducting inquiries of its own . \n`` The obvious answer to removing uncertainties that remain is to commission a larger study with full official support and assistance , but scientific independence , '' they say . \n`` Counting casualties can help to save lives both now and in the future by helping us to understand the burden of death , and residual burden of injury , disease and trauma across the entire population , '' the experts say . \n`` We have waited too long for this information . '' \nThe Iraqi ministry of health data is not complete . \nAmong the reasons for this are that only violence-related deaths reported through the health system are counted and deaths in the first 12 months of the conflict are not included . \nAmong the 10 experts from the UK who have signed the statement are Klim McPherson , visiting professor of public health epidemiology at Oxford University , David Hunter , chair of the UK Public Health Association , and Sian Griffiths , immediate past-president of the faculty of public health at the Royal College of Physicians . \nThere are seven eminent physicians from the US , three from Australia , two from Spain and one each from Canada and Italy . \n`` Monitoring casualties is a humanitarian imperative , '' they say . \n`` Understanding the causes of death is a core public health responsibility , nationally and internationally . \nYet neither the public , nor we as public health professionals , are able to obtain validated , reliable information about the extent of mortality and morbidity since the invasion of Iraq . '' \nIn a commentary in the BMJ , Professor McPherson says that public access to reliable figures is important . \n`` The policy being assessed - the allied invasion of Iraq - was justified largely on grounds of democratic supremacy . \nVoters in the countries that initiated the war and others - not least in Iraq itself - are denied a reliable evaluation of a key indicator of the success of that policy . \nThis is unacceptable . '' \nUnderstanding the burden of death , disease , injury and trauma aids the proper planning of war and health and will help governments assess the humanitarian implications of conflict , he says . \n`` The plain fact is that an estimate of 100,000 excess deaths attributable to the invasion of Iraq is alarming . \nThat is already half the death toll of Hiroshima . \nApart from the practical arguments , the principled ones stand and will always stand . \nHave we not learned any lessons from the history of sweeping alarming numbers of deaths under the carpet ? \nThis is not something about which there can be any political discretion 60 years after Auschwitz . '' \nThe Foreign Office said yesterday it believed the figures from the Iraqi ministry of health were the most reliable because they were based on head counts not extrapolation . \n"}

'' \nMr Talabani , who was hailed by a standing ovation in parliament , pledged to work with all ethnic and religious factions to rebuild Iraq after decades of conflict and dictatorship . \nFor weeks , the Islamist-led Shia alliance that won a slim majority in parliament and the Kurdish coalition that came second in the polls have been arguing about forming a government . \nKurdish parties were especially keen to counter Shia influence by including representatives of the Sunni Arab minority in a national unity government . \nDisagreement over which Sunni would be vice-president held up a deal , but political leaders decided late yesterday to favor Mr Yawar over elder statesman Adnan Pachachi . \nFrustration among Iraqis who braved suicide bombs and threats to vote grew as the wrangling went on . \nSome key decisions - such as who occupies the important oil and defense ministries - remain to be made . \nMany Iraqis complained that politicians had let them down by taking so long to form a government , fearing the delay could have benefited Iraq 's still active insurgency . \nA western diplomat in Baghdad told the Associated Press : `` The people are waiting for success , while the insurgents are waiting for failure .

{"id": "331", "time": "2005-04-06", "text": "Wednesday 6 April 2005 12.47 BST It looks like a Naomi Klein book . \nIt has her name emblazoned on the cover . \nIn a tilt to her bestseller , No Logo , it 's called No War . \nThe design is strikingly similar . \nThe book 's synopsis on Amazon namechecks the activist writer in the first sentence . \nBut , according to Klein , No War by Naomi Klein is not by her at all . \nIt is an anthology of essays which , says Klein , `` contains one previously published magazine article by me that has been available free-of-charge on my website for eight months '' . \nKlein is adamant that `` No War is not my book ; I had no role in choosing the title , and will accept no revenue from its sales . \n`` I am very concerned that readers will mistakenly believe that they are purchasing original writing , despite my best efforts to convince the publisher to clearly label the book what it is : an anthology of previously published articles by multiple authors , '' she adds . \nSo what 's going on ? \nThe # 4.99 paperback is published by Gibson Square books , a publishing company founded in 2001 by Martin Rynja , the former commissioning editor of Duckworth 's . \nAccording to its website , Gibson Square `` specialises in books with either a strong biographical element , or those which are based in some relevant way on personal experience . \nThey will , in addition , have a high publicity potential and be able to provoke or contribute to a current debate '' . \nGibson Square Books is certainly no stranger to controversy . \nLast July the independent publisher picked up Craig Unger 's House of Bush , House of Saud after Random House pulled out of a deal amid fears it could be sued for libel . \nThe book inspired some of the more sensational allegations contained in Michael Moore 's film Farenheit 9\\/11 and Amazon . \nco. uk refused to stock the book although all the major bookchains and Amazon 's US site carried it . \nAccording to Martin Rynja , the confusion over No War has arisen because of a last minute change of format of the book . \nGibson Square had originally intended to publish Klein 's article on its own . \nRynja says that he read the piece and thought it was `` mind-blowing - it 's long but it 's punchy and casts a light on the Iraq war which I found completely compelling . \nIt has the ` a-ha ! ' \nelement - after you have read it , something you have always vaguely thought becomes crystal clear '' . \nHe sought rights from Klein via her website and was sent a standard response email about the essay which said that the rights were controlled by Harper 's , the original publishers of the article . \nThe magazine agreed to sub-licence the article . \nRynja says that all was running smoothly until about three weeks before the publication date when he had two long conversations with Klein about the book . \n`` I heard that she is working on a new book on the subject and did n't want the essay published on its own , '' he says . \n`` She felt passionately that the book should be turned into an anthology with more authors included . \nWe could have gone ahead and published the essay on its own , as planned , if we had wanted as we had the rights , but because she felt very strongly and I admire her as a great thinker and writer - in the calibre of Noam Chomsky or Hannah Arendt - I did what I could and we missed the original publication date in order to include three other extremely strong authors who develop the seam of the lead article further . '' \nThe three other contributors are Susan Watkins , writing on the Iraq war as a front for US commercial , interests , Brian Miller on selling Iraq and Walter Lecoeur on terrorism . \nAccording to Rynja , the reason the other contributors are not mentioned on any of the online information about the book is because the revised data submitted to Neilson Bookdata and Amazon has not yet been updated and the sites are still displaying information referring to the original version of the Klein-only book . \nIn response to Klein 's claim that the writing in the book is not `` original '' , Ryjna argues that many books are published first in the US and then in the UK , or carried from one medium to another and that the work itself stays original . \n`` There is a market for books in their physical form rather than in electronic form , '' he says , `` it 's simply bringing her very important message to different markets . '' \nHowever , the situation may be murkier than it first appears . \nWhile it is true that Harper 's had syndication rights on Klein 's essay , the author retained the book contract rights and the sale of them to Ryjna by Harper 's was a mistake - one about which Klein says she knew nothing until three weeks before the book was due to be published . \nAt this point , having failed to persuade Ryjna to withdraw the book , Klein and her agent tried to salvage the situation as best they could , and avoid a protracted legal battle , by mooting the possibility of an anthology in which all the contributors would be equally credited . \nAgain , however , Gibson Square have a different take on events : they reiterate that they did approach Klein , via her website , to ask for the rights to publish the essay in book form in the UK and were told to approach the magazine , from whom the rights were obtained . \nThey then claim they went back to Klein in the first week of March to ask for corrections or additions , at which point the idea to include three other writers came up , and was agreed to . \nPolitico 's , the specialist political online bookstore , is advertising No War as being `` by Naomi Klein '' on its website , and reports no complaints about it from customers but they have not yet sold a single copy of the book . \n`` I was not aware of Naomi Klein 's statement but I will look into it , '' said a spokesman for Politicos , `` If the book is being mis-sold we will take it off the site . '' \nWaterstone 's Economist 's Bookshop at the LSE said that they had sold three copies of the book , from a stock of about 25 , and had received no complaints from customers . \nThe book is officially published on April 18 and , says Rynja , Gibson Square 's wholesalers have already sold nearly a thousand copies of the book . \nMeanwhile , Naomi Klein is encouraging readers interested in her essay , Baghdad Year Zero , to download it for free from her website , nologo.org . \n"}

\nNothing is wrong with genuine efforts at understanding ; on these we all depend . \nBut the genuine article is one thing , and root-causes advocacy seeking to dissipate responsibility for atrocity , mass murder , crime against humanity , especially in the immediate aftermath of their occurrence , is something else . \nNote the selectivity in the way root-causes arguments function . \nPurporting to be about causal explanation rather than excuse-making , they are invariably deployed on behalf of movements or actions for which their proponent wants to engage our indulgence , and in order to direct blame towards some party towards whom he or she is unsympathetic . \nA hypothetical example illustrates the point . \nSuppose that , on account of the present situation in Zimbabwe , the government decides to halt all scheduled deportations of Zimbabweans . \nSome BNP thugs are made angry by this and express their anger by beating up a passer-by who happens to be an African immigrant . \nCan you imagine a single person of left or liberal outlook who would blame this act of violence on the government 's decision or urge us to consider sympathetically the root causes of the act ? \nIt would n't happen , because the anger of the thugs does n't begin to justify what they have done . \nThe root-causers always plead a desire merely to expand our understanding , but they 're very selective in what they want to `` understand '' . \nIf causes and explanation are indeed a serious enterprise and not merely a convenient partisan game , then it needs to be recognized that causality is one thing and moral responsibility another , though the two are related . \nThe fact that something someone else does contributes causally to a crime or atrocity does n't show that they , as well as the direct agents , are morally responsible for that crime or atrocity , if what they have contributed causally is not itself wrong and does n't serve to justify it . \nFurthermore , even when what someone else has contributed causally to the occurrence of the criminal or atrocious act is wrong , this wo n't necessarily show they bear any of the blame for it . \nThe `` We told you so '' crowd all just somehow know that the Iraq war was an effective cause of the deaths in London . \nHow do they know this , these clever people ? \nFor what they need to know is not just that Iraq was one of a number of influencing causes , but that it was the specific , and a necessary , motivating cause for the London bombings . \nIf it was only an influencing motivational cause among others , and if , more particularly , another such motivational cause was supplied by the military intervention in Afghanistan , then it 's not the case that the London bombings would n't have happened but for the Iraq war . \nEver on the lookout for damning causes , the root-causers never go for the most obvious of these . \nThis is the cause , indeed , which shows , by its absence , why most critics of the Iraq war or of anything else do n't murder people when they are angry . \nIt is the fanatical , fundamentalist belief system which teaches hatred and justifies these acts of murder . \nThat cause somehow gets a free pass from the hunters-out of causes . \nThere are apologists among us , and they have to be fought intellectually and politically . \nThey do not help to strengthen the democratic culture and institutions whose benefits we all share . \nBecause we believe in and value these , we have to contend with what such people say . \nBut contend with is precisely it . \nWe have to challenge their excuses without let-up . \n"}

'' \nThe Irish Guards who have been charged are alleged to have punched and kicked a looter before forcing him into the Shatt al-Basra canal , where he drowned . \nThe soldier went on : `` Soldiers will be scared to touch anyone . \nIf you run over and crack one of them -LRB- an Iraqi -RRB- on the back of the legs and put them in plasticuffs and nick them and then the MPs are on your patrol and they go back to camp and then pass it on to SIB -LRB- Special Investigation Branch -RRB- and then they decide you are too aggressive , what were you supposed to do ? \nYou are told by your commander , ` Right lads , you are going out on aggressive patrol , ' so you have got to go out and patrol aggressively . \nThen they put their umbrellas up and deny all knowledge of this and it 's the average soldier that gets the shit . '' \nOne still-serving veteran of the Iraq war called the charges `` a bloody disgrace '' and said : `` It 's hardly going to make anyone want to go there any more than they do at the moment . '' \nHe added that soldiers of lower rank were not officially schooled in the Geneva conventions or laws of war . \nThe soldier , serving in the newly merged Scottish Regiment , was part of the advance guard sent into the battle zone of central Iraq , alongside US troops . \nA number of his fellow soldiers were killed and others very seriously injured . \n`` It 's a while since I was in Iraq , '' the soldier said . \n`` But even then the feeling was not too high . \nFolk are usually relieved to be sent somewhere else . \nIt 's not a popular place to serve , and it 's getting less of one . \nCertainly if you suddenly find you end up in a court because you 're accused ... yes , not by the army , but by politicians '' . \nTalking from barracks in Warminster , Wiltshire , the soldier said : `` People have got to understand that when you 're facing the kind of enemy in Iraq , this is n't an enemy with a uniform . \nThis is suicide bombers and stuff . \nIt could be anybody . \nYou do n't know who is who . \nYou do n't know who you are supposed to be protecting and who is going to attack you , whether they 're in a car , or on the street . '' \nEarlier this year four soldiers were convicted in courts martial in Germany of the abuse of Iraqi looters in what became known as the Camp Breadbasket scandal , in which prisoners were forced to strip naked and were photographed simulating sexual positions . \nThe four members of the 1st Battalion , the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers claimed that they had been scapegoated and that an order had been given that they `` work '' the looters and force them to run with boxes on their heads . \nIn their defense , the soldiers claimed they had not been briefed on the Geneva convention and had not been told how to treat prisoners . \nLast night the soldier with the Scottish Regiment said : `` We do n't really get taught officially what 's in the Geneva convention . \nNo one gave me anything to read or anything . \nMaybe there 's a rough idea it exists , you know , about civilians ... yes , prisoners and all that . \nI think the officers might get more details , study it all . \nBut no one ever told me to . \nI think most people think that sort of thing is done with proper war , between armies , not terrorism and looting . '' \nAnother former corporal , who served on the frontline during Operation Telic - the codename for the British operation in Iraq - but has since left the army , said : `` It 's terrible that it 's happening . \nI do n't think Britain should have signed it -LRB- the International Criminal Court Act 2001 -RRB- in the first place . \nThe Americans are exempt from it . \nThis is just putting British soldiers ' lives at risk . \n`` I think the fact that these lads are getting prosecuted and it could happen to any other British soldier is wrong . \nIf all this was happening 60 years ago , where would we be now ? \nIn the present climate it adds more fuel to the fire for these terrorists in Iraq . '' \nAnother former soldier , who served in Iraq with the Household Cavalry for six months , said : `` You are out there to do the job . \nIf you have got to start thinking about silly things that you might be prosecuted for , you 're putting people 's lives at risk . \n`` If you have got to think about that at a moment 's notice , it is going to be you on the floor and not them . \nIt is going to bring the morale of the British soldier down . \nThat 's when you will get people refusing to go out and soldier in Iraq . \nI would definitely consider not going out and doing it , especially if I thought I was going to be shot . \n`` The people that are sitting behind a desk that are putting these people through the court , they should really put themselves in the shoes of soldiers and see what he goes through in Iraq and other places like that . \nIt 's just constant pressure out there , never knowing when your next bit of rest is going to be . \nYou 're always worrying whether you are going to be bombed or shot at , you never know what 's going to happen .

we have our own voices , however muffled they may seem . \nIf communities are not to be corrupted by the government , the only patriotism possible is one that refuses the banality of taking either side , and continues the arduous conversation . \nThat is why we have literature , the theater , newspapers - a culture , in other words . \nWar debases our intelligence and derides what we have called `` civilisation '' and `` culture '' and `` freedom '' . \nIf it is true that we have entered a spiral of violence , repression and despair that will take years to unravel , our only hope is moral honesty about what we have brought about . \nAnd not only us . \nIf we need to ensure that what we call `` civilisation '' retains its own critical position towards violence , religious groups have to purge themselves of their own intolerant and deeply authoritarian aspects . \nThe body hatred and terror of sexuality that characterise most religions can lead people not only to cover their bodies in shame but to think of themselves as human bombs . \nThis criticism on both sides is the only way to temper an inevitable legacy of bitterness , hatred and conflict . \n"}

'' \nMr Straw said in Brussels yesterday : `` I 'm astonished Chatham House is now saying that we should not have stood shoulder to shoulder with our long-standing allies . '' \n`` The terrorists have struck across the world , in countries allied with the US , backing the war in Iraq and in countries which had nothing whatever to do with the war in Iraq . '' \nBut the Guardian\\/ICM poll shows the public believe that Britain 's frontline role has made the country a more obvious target . \nAnd it shows that while Britons have reacted relatively calmly to the attacks earlier this month - with 83 % saying they were no less likely to travel into central London and 75 % saying they were just as likely to use the tube - the public does want the government to respond with new legislation . \nA clear majority - 71 % - want the government to exclude or deport from the UK foreign Muslims who incite hatred with only 22 % believing such people should be allowed to live in the UK . \nThat may give some comfort to ministers as they seek to persuade opposition parties to support new laws making it an offence to incite terrorism . \nBut the poll also shows that despite the attacks , there is increasingly limited public support for ID cards . \nOnly 53 % of those questioned said they believed ID cards should be brought in to help in the fight against terrorism - a fall on previous findings before and after the bombings . \nReflecting the relative cross-party unity that has dominated politics since the attacks , the poll also finds that Labor 's poll lead remains almost unchanged on last month 's Guardian\\/ICM findings . \nDespite public unease about the prime minister 's decision to support the invasion of Iraq , Labor has the support of 39 % of voters -LRB- up one point on last month -RRB- , the Conservatives 31 % -LRB- no change -RRB- and the Liberal Democrats 23 % -LRB- no change -RRB- . \nICM interviewed a random sample of 1,005 adults aged 18 + by telephone between July 15 and 17 . \nInterviews were conducted across the country and the results have been weighted to the profile of all adults . \nICM is a member of the British Polling Council and abides by its rules . \n"}

'' \nMrs Linehan , whose son , Colin , served as a doctor in Iraq between November 2003 and October 2004 , said the main problem for Ms Fonda would be the American press . \n`` The danger will be that they just pick up on the surface layer , but I would hope people will welcome anybody who can stir a discussion on Iraq and draws attention to the real issues .

'' \nOthers believe that Wolfowitz , seen as the intellectual force among the administration 's neo-conservatives , was always an uneasy fit at the Pentagon . \n`` When he was named deputy of secretary of defense I thought of a number of positions where he would be even more in tune with what was going on , '' says Thomas Keaney , a defense expert who worked with Wolfowitz during one of his brief spells out of government at the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University . \n`` I thought he was even more in tune with international development and globalisation . \nThis is a good fit . '' \nIt is also a welcome escape for Wolfowitz , who has spent much of the past two years trying to defend his policies to Congress . \nThe academic high priest of the Vulcans , as the president 's coterie of security advisers called themselves , Wolfowitz is associated inextricably with the greatest disasters of the Iraq war : the rosy predictions on the eve of the conflict that US soldiers would be welcomed with open arms as liberators , and his insistence that reconstruction could be financed from Iraqi oil revenues . \n`` I think he and the Bush White House have slightly different agendas . \nThe Bush White House wanted to promote and reward a guy without going through - though they would never say this - a bruising confirmation battle for some other US government job , '' says James Mann , the author of a history of the Bush war cabinet called Rise of the Vulcans . \n`` He sees it as a chance to launch into an entirely new area , and to get away from being stuck on defense and military issues . '' \nNow 61 , Wolfowitz was born into a Polish Jewish immigrant family , and grew up mainly in the university town of Ithaca , New York , where his father was a professor of statistical theory at Cornell University . \nAt 14 he spent a year in Israel while his father was a visiting professor in Haifa , and his sister emigrated to the country . \nBut he is one of the few neo-conservatives in the Bush administration to endorse the creation of a Palestinian state , and was heckled at a pro-Israeli rally in 2002 for acknowledging Palestinian suffering . \nTo please his father , the younger Wolfowitz enrolled at Cornell , too , where he studied maths and was offered a full scholarship , but went on to pursue his own interests in political science , doing graduate studies at the University of Chicago . \nThere he encountered such leading conservative figures as Leo Strauss and Albert Wohlstetter , under whom he wrote his doctorate on the dangers of a nuclearised Middle East . \nSignificantly for a neo-conservative , that included the threat posed by a nuclear-armed Israel . \nSince coming to Washington to work as an intern in the arms control and disarmament agency in 1973 , Wolfowitz has worked almost exclusively in government , apart from a period of exile during the Clinton years , when he headed the School of Advanced International Studies . \nEven colleagues who disagree violently with his view of the world concede that Wolfowitz was far more congenial than the usual Washington apparatchik . \n`` He does n't do what I have often seen in Washington which is treat you like a piece of furniture , '' says Dan Gour , a fellow at the Lexington Institute , who met Wolfowitz 30 years ago when he gave him a job at the arms control agency . \n`` Even if he was critical of something you had done for him , it was not done in a way that would diminish you as an individual . '' \nBut despite sharp intelligence , willingness to put in 18-hour work days , and a genial , low-key manner , Wolfowitz has never before held a leadership position . \nInstead , he became `` the most influential underling in Washington '' , as Mann writes in his book . \nOver the years he worked under six presidents , including the Democrat , Jimmy Carter . \nBut Wolfowitz 's preoccupations have not radically changed since his days as a graduate student : a belief in the importance of military power and that America is a force for good in the world , a distrust of the Soviet Union and of America 's intelligence agencies , and a disdain for the Kissinger doctrines of detente and containment . \nSince 2001 Wolfowitz has added another pillar to his ideology : a belief that the September 11 terror attacks changed the world forever . \nClues to the way in which Wolfowitz would respond to that change as deputy Pentagon chief were evident from his first days in Washington . \nAs a junior official at the Pentagon in 1977 he presided over a project which looked at the possibility of a Soviet seizure of Gulf oilfields . \nHe also explored the consequences of an Iraqi attack on Saudi Arabia or Kuwait . \nTo Mann , that was typical . \n`` He stands out for me from many other neo-conservatives for the frequency with which he takes core beliefs and then asks the next question , '' he says . \nDuring the 80s , Wolfowitz 's interests shifted from the Middle East to Asia , when he moved to the state department as assistant secretary for east Asia , then ambassador to Indonesia . \nSupporters say those years convinced him of the importance of using American might to promote democratic change . \nHe was , by all accounts , a successful ambassador . \nBut some who acknowledge his popularity also discount the argument that Wolfowitz used his influence as an envoy to press for change . \n`` It is really too much to claim that he played any kind of role in leading Indonesia to democracy , '' says Jeffrey Winters , an expert on Indonesia at Chicago 's Northwestern University , who was in the country at the time . \n`` The real record when you dig into it is that he was very slow to respond to Indonesia 's movement for democracy . \nIndonesia 's citizens across the spectrum had been struggling against authoritarian rule . \nThey had been tortured . \nThey had been jailed . \nThey had been ruined in various ways , and the Wolfowitz embassy did n't speak up for them - not once . '' \nHe adds : `` He had his chance , and he toed the Reagan hawkish line . '' \nThe World Bank will be watching for far more than that from Wolfowitz . \nBorn 1943 in Brooklyn , New York . \nSon of Jacob Wolfowitz , a leading Polish mathematician who emigrated in 1920 , and Lillian Dundes Family Married in 1968 to Clare Selgin . \nThree children ; divorced 2002 Educated Cornell University -LRB- bachelor 's degree in maths , 1965 -RRB- , University of Chicago -LRB- PhD , political science , 1972 -RRB- Career Lecturer , political science , Yale 1970-73 ; deputy assistant secretary of defense ,1977 - 80 ; state department policy planning staff head1981-82 ; assistant secretary for east Asian and Pacific affairs , 1983-86 ; ambassador to Indonesia 1986-89 ; undersecretary of defence,1989-93 ; deputy defense secretary , 2001-05 ; World Bank president , 2005 A former colleague says `` Hawk does n't do him justice . \nWhat about velociraptor ?

{"id": "231", "time": "2005-04-01", "text": "A presidential commission investigating the intelligence debacle that preceded the Iraq invasion reported yesterday that the damage done to US credibility would `` take years to undo '' . \nAmerican intelligence was described by the report as being in chaos , often paralysed by the rivalry of 15 different spy agencies and affected by unchallenged assumptions about Baghdad 's supposed weapons of mass destruction . \nThe incompetence described in the report occasionally descends into farce , particularly over an Iraqi defector codenamed Curveball , whose fabricated tales about mobile biological laboratories and their influence on US decision-makers were reminiscent of Graham Greene 's accidental spy in Our Man in Havana . \nDespite warnings that he was `` crazy '' , `` a waste of time '' , and that he had not even been in Iraq at the time of an event he supposedly saw , his claims became the subject of almost 100 Defense Intelligence Agency reports and a focus of the National Intelligence Estimate in October 2002 . \nMost critically , Curveball 's description of mobile laboratories provided one of the highlights of Colin Powell 's address to the UN security council on February 5 2003 , in which the then US secretary of state laid out the justification for the invasion . \nCurveball 's story has already been told in part , but yesterday 's account is the most comprehensive . \nHe was an Iraqi chemical engineer who was first debriefed in 2000 by a foreign liaison service - not named in yesterday 's report but elsewhere reported as being German intelligence . \nBefore the war , the Germans refused to let US interrogators question Curveball directly , saying that he `` would refuse to speak to Americans '' ; they just passed on his claims , according to the Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction . \nWarning signs emerged in May 2000 when a military intelligence officer was allowed to visit Curveball . \nHe reported : `` I do have a concern with the validity of the information , based on Curveball having a terrible hangover the morning of -LRB- the meeting -RRB- . '' \nThe warning fell on deaf ears , but by autumn 2002 the CIA was growing increasingly nervous , knowing it had not met an important source . \nSo a meeting was arranged between the local CIA division chief and German intelligence officers . \nWhen the division chief asked whether US agents could question the defector , `` the foreign intelligence service responded with words to the effect of ` You do n't want to see him because he 's crazy ' - furthermore , the -LRB- German -RRB- representative said that he worried that Curveball was ' a fabricator ' . '' \nThe division chief passed on this alarming news to his superiors , but George Tenet , then CIA chief , and his deputy , John McLaughlin , both denied having been told of it . \nOn the eve of Mr Powell 's UN speech , Mr Tenet and senior intelligence officers were cloistered with the secretary of state in New York , going over the administration 's claims . \nAt midnight Mr Tenet called the division chief at home , but the two men have different recollections of the conversation . \n`` Although he did not remember his exact words , the division chief says that he told Mr Tenet something to the effect of ` You know that the -LRB- foreign service -RRB- reporting has problems ' . \nAccording to the division chief , Mr Tenet replied with words to the effect of ` Yeah , yeah ' and that he was ` exhausted ' , '' the report says . \nIt continues : `` The division chief said that when he listened to the speech ... he was surprised the information from Curveball had been included . '' \nQuestioned by the commission , however , Mr Tenet denied that the subject of Curveball had ever been raised . \nCurveball is reportedly related to a senior member of the Iraqi national congress -LRB- INC -RRB- , then an exile group . \nHowever , the commission found that the INC had not brought him forward . \nThe report is another nail in the coffin of Mr Tenet 's reputation and clears the White House and Pentagon of trying to shape intelligence to justify war . \nIt concludes : `` The commission found no evidence of political pressure to influence the intelligence community 's prewar assessments of Iraq 's weapons programs . '' \nIt warns only of the dangers of intelligence leaders becoming too close to the president and risking the loss of objectivity . \nIn other words , the commission found that Mr Tenet had been too eager to please . \n"}

'' \nBritish defense sources last night repeated the British government 's stated policy that its troops will stay in Iraq `` as long as is necessary and as long as the Iraqis want us '' . \nMr Berlusconi 's comments about a precise exit strategy were `` an aspiration '' or `` political guesswork '' , they added . \nMr Berlusconi , who is among President Bush 's closest allies , has been under huge domestic pressure over Italy 's staunch support for US policy in Iraq . \nEarly next month , he faces a test of electoral strength and in recent weeks he has felt the full force of Italians ' misgivings . \nOn March 4 , a senior intelligence officer , Nicola Calipari , was killed by US troops in Baghdad after rescuing an Italian hostage . \nHis death united right and left in appalled condemnation , with thousands of Italians turning out to pay their respects to the dead agent during a lying in state . \nMr Berlusconi dropped his bombshell last night hours af ter Italy 's lower house of parliament , in which the prime minister 's supporters have an outright majority , approved funding for its contingent in Iraq until the end of June . \nItalian officials had already indicated troops would be withdrawn as soon as it was clear that Iraq could handle its own security . \nBut Mr Berlusconi went much further than before in defining the outlines of a timetable . \nHe said : `` A progressive reduction of the presence of our soldiers will start from September . '' \nHe added that the phase-out would take place `` in agreement with our allies '' . \nHe was careful not to let himself be pinned down to a finishing date , saying that would `` depend on the ability of the Iraqi government in equipping itself with adequate security and public order forces '' . \nWith 3,000 troops , Italy is one of the biggest contributors to the US-led coalition . \nIts forces did not take part in the invasion of Iraq , but were sent in afterwards as part of what Mr Berlusconi and his ministers have always insisted was a peace mission . \nYesterday saw Italy 's death toll reach 21 when it was announced that a soldier had accidentally shot and killed himself during target practice . \nIn London , the government announced yesterday it was proposing an international conference on Iraq later this year to encourage the United Nations and other major organizations to kickstart the stalled reconstruction program . \nA similar idea for a postwar conference was put forward by France a year ago but was blocked by the US , because it was proposed by a country that had spearheaded international opposition to the war . \nBut the British idea is gaining widespread support , including that of the US and France . \nThe conference would bring together the countries contributing troops , those offering economic help , and the UN , the World Bank , the International Monetary Fund and other international bodies . \nBritish officials said that the Iraq conference is likely to be held abroad , probably in Brussels . \nThe proposal comes as the Iraqi assembly , elected on Jan uary 30 , meets today for the first time . \nBut the Shias and Kurds who make up the bulk of the 275-member parliament have so far failed to reach agreement on the formation of a coalition government . \nThe assembly will meet behind the concrete blast-barriers and barbed wire that separates Baghdad 's Green Zone , home to the US and British embassies and the interim Iraqi government , from the rest of the Iraqi capital . \n"}
{"id": "65", "time": "2005-03-16", "text": "Wednesday 16 March 2005 03.26 GMT The Pentagon stood accused of sitting on a damaging report from its own auditors on a $ 108.4 m -LRB- # 56.6 m -RRB- overcharge by Halliburton for its services in Iraq yesterday . \nIn a scathing letter to George Bush , Democratic congressmen Henry Waxman of California and John Dingell of Michigan said the Defense Contract Audit Agency 's audit was completes last October - before the election . \nThey also note that 12 separate requests to the Pentagon to view the completed audits on the contractor 's $ 2.5 bn contract to supply fuel and other services in post-war Iraq had been ignored . \n`` We would like to know why this audit report - and audit reports on nine additional task orders - are being withheld from Congress , '' they wrote . \n`` We also want to know what steps you are taking to recover these funds from Halliburton . '' \nIn a second public letter yesterday , Mr Waxman accused Bush administration officials of deliberately withholding information on overcharges by Halliburton from UN auditors - at its behest . \nSome $ 1.6 bn of the $ 2.5 bn Halliburton contract was funded from Iraqi oil revenues overseen by the UN . \n`` The evidence suggests that the US used Iraqi oil proceeds to overpay Halliburton and then sought to hide the evidence of these overcharges from the international auditors , '' the letter says . \nThe audit , released by the congressmen on Monday , offers the most definitive glimpse so far of overbilling by Halliburton , once run by the vice president , Dick Cheney . \nIn the most startling transaction , it charged the Pentagon $ 27.5 m to ship $ 82,100 worth of cooking and heating fuel to Iraq from Kuwait - 335 times the actual cost of the liquified petroleum gas , a charge the Pentagon auditors said was `` illogical '' . \nThe firm and its subsidiary , Kellogg , Brown and Root -LRB- KBR -RRB- , face several investigations , including a fraud inquiry from the justice department . \nA preliminary Pentagon audit , focused on the immediate aftermath of the US-led invasion , found KBR overcharged the Pentagon by $ 61m for kerosene and other fuels . \nCritics of Halliburton are convinced this represents just a fraction of the overcharges . \nThe audit released this week covers only one of 10 task orders undertaken under the $ 2.5 bn no-bid contract awarded immediately after the invasion of Iraq . \nHowever , the overcharges identified in the single task order already dwarf the $ 61m -LRB- # 32m -RRB- in previously discovered overcharges . \nHalliburton charged army corps of engineers $ 875m -LRB- # 457m -RRB- to supply fuel from May 2003 to March 2004 . \nAuditors questioned $ 108.4 m -LRB- # 56.6 m -RRB- of those costs . \nAs the Congressmen note , the auditors criticised charges in nearly every area , saying the firm misled auditors and failed to supervise sub-contracts . \n`` Halliburton failed to demonstrate its prices for Kuwaiti fuel were ` fair and reasonable ' , '' the auditors say . \nThey also note Halliburton refused repeatedly to provide information on costs of obtaining fuel from Turkey and Jordan , or reveal how it selected its contractors in Kuwait . \nA Halliburton spokeswoman , Wendy Hall , said it was forced into paying , and charging , high costs because of the security situation following the war . \n`` Transporting fuel into Iraq was a mission fraught with danger , which increased the prices that firms were willing to offer for trans portation , '' she told reporters . \n`` The report fails to take into account the fact KBR performed an urgent mission at the army 's request and the mission took place in a wartime environment . '' \nThe lawyer for an army corps of engineers whistle-blower said that his client was set to be interviewed for a second time by Pentagon investigators on April 4 over her claims of contracting abuse involving KBR . \n"}
{"id": "97", "time": "2005-07-04", "text": "Monday 4 July 2005 15.20 BST Following is an edited transcript of US President George Bush 's interview on Tonight with Trevor McDonald to be broadcast on ITV1 at 8pm today . \nSIR TREVOR MCDONALD FOR TONIGHT : Mr President , the G8 summit will be chaired by Tony Blair . \nHe wants to get new international agreements on aid , on trade and on climate change . \nNow , he gave you unstinting support over the war in Iraq - can he expect the same support from you over the G8 ? \nPRESIDENT BUSH : You know , Tony Blair made decisions on what he thought was best for the people of Great Britain , and I made decisions on what I thought was best for Americans . \nAnd I really do n't view our relationship as one of quid pro quo . \nI view our relationship as one of strong allies and friends working together for the common good . \nTONIGHT : On the question of Tony Blair , his support for you on Iraq probably damaged him politically at home . \nSupporting his proposals in Edinburgh might be one way of paying him back and making sure that he can probably repair some of that damage . \nPRESIDENT BUSH : Well , again , I really do n't view our relationship as one of , you know , we both make decisions and try to earn credit with each other on a personal basis . \nTony Blair made decisions on what he thought was best for keeping the peace and winning the war on terror , as did I. So I go to the G8 not really trying to make him look bad or good ; but I go to the G8 with an agenda that I think is best for our country . \nTONIGHT : The subject of climate change is one of the subjects on the G8 agenda . \nNow , the majority of the world 's leading scientists now agree that climate change is a reality . \nDo you agree with their conclusion ? \nPRESIDENT BUSH : I believe it is a significant , long-term issue that we 've got to deal with . \nAnd that 's why my government is dealing with it . \nWe spent I think over $ 20 billion since I 've been the president to not only research the issue of greenhouse gases , but to develop technologies that will enable us to diversify away from fossil fuels . \nAnd I look forward to discussing this agenda with not only the G8 leaders , but also with the leaders of developing countries , countries like India and China . \nTONIGHT : Do you accept that climate change is man-made , sir ? \nPRESIDENT BUSH : To a certain extent it is , obviously . \nI mean , if fossil fuels create greenhouse gases , we 're burning fossil fuel , as is a lot of other countries . \nYou know , look , there was a debate over Kyoto , and I made the decision - as did a lot of other people in this country , by the way - that the Kyoto treaty did n't suit our needs . \nIn other words , the Kyoto treaty would have wrecked our economy , if I can be blunt . \nAnd so my hope is - and I think the hope of Tony Blair is - to move beyond the Kyoto debate and to collaborate on new technologies that will enable the United States and other countries to diversify away from fossil fuels so that the air will be cleaner and that we have the economic and national security that comes from less dependence on foreign sources of oil ... To that end , we 're investing in a lot of hydrogen - research on hydrogen-powered automobiles . \nI believe we 'll be able to burn coal without emitting any greenhouse gases , zero emissions plant . \nAnd so , therefore , we 've got to spend money and share technology as to how to move forward . \nTONIGHT : But Mr President , if I may , the predictions about global warming - and I hear what you say - are very dire . \nThe UK 's chief scientist says that it probably poses a bigger threat than global terrorism . \nIs n't it , therefore , irresponsible for you to say , as you 've done , that you walked away from Kyoto and you wo n't order cuts in carbon dioxide emissions because it would damage America 's economy ? \nPRESIDENT BUSH : I walked away from Kyoto because it would damage America 's economy , you bet . \nIt would have destroyed our economy . \nIt was a lousy deal for the American economy . \nI felt there was a better way . \nAnd that 's why -- TONIGHT -LRB- interrupting -RRB- : But is that putting American industrial economic interests above the global interests of the environment ? \nPRESIDENT BUSH : No , I think you can do both . \nSee , I think you can grow your economy and at the same time do a better job of harnessing greenhouse gases . \nThat 's exactly what I intend to talk to our partners about . \nI do n't think you can expect any American leader to wreck the economy , nor as an ally and a friend of America and a trading partner of America should you want us to wreck our economy . \nOn the other hand , what you would want us to do is to use our investment capacity , as well as our research capacity to come up with new ways to power our economy , new ways to energise our economy . \nAnd that 's precisely what we 're doing , and I look forward to sharing those ideas . \nSecondly , the Kyoto treaty would n't work unless all nations were involved . \nAnd as you know , many of the developing nations were n't involved in Kyoto . \nSo some of the discussions we 're going to have at the G8 , thanks to Tony Blair 's leadership , is to work with India and China as to how to share technology with them , so that we can all work together to clean up the environment , and at the same time have sustained economic growth . \nTONIGHT : They are expecting , many countries are expecting international legal binding agreements on cutting greenhouse gas emissions . \nCan they expect your support in doing that ? \nPRESIDENT BUSH : If this looks like Kyoto , the answer is no. . \nOn the other hand , if people want to come together and share technologies and develop technologies and jointly spend - and spend money on research and development , just like the United States is , to help us diversify away from fossil fuels , -LRB- I am -RRB- more than willing to discuss it . \nI know we need more nuclear power in order - nuclear power , after all , is not dependent on fossil fuels and emits no greenhouse gases . \nI believe we 're going to be able to have coal-fired plants that have zero emissions . \nWe need to work on carbon sequestration technologies . \nI mean , there 's a lot we can do together and achieve the objective , which a lot of people want , which is the reduction of greenhouse gases , and at the same time , have viable economic growth . \nTONIGHT : And because , sir , America remains the biggest polluter . \nPRESIDENT BUSH : America is the largest investor in the technologies necessary to be able to say to people , ` You can grow your economy so people 's standard of living can improve , and at the same time be good stewards of the environment ' . \nTONIGHT : But pollution in this country has increased amazingly since 1992 . \nPRESIDENT BUSH : That is a totally inaccurate statement . \nTONIGHT : It 's a UN figure . \nPRESIDENT BUSH : Well , I just beg to differ with every figure you 've got . \nThe environment has - the quality of the environment has improved , in spite of the fact that we 've grown our economy . \nTONIGHT : You recently helped , Mr President , to scrap the debt burden on some of Africa 's poorest countries - and you 've won some praise for that . \nBut should n't a country as rich as yours be giving much more in direct aid to these poverty stricken countries of Africa ? \nPRESIDENT BUSH : Well , we 've tripled the budget on direct aid to the countries in Africa since I 've been the president - tripled it . \nWe have got a great trade agreement with the African nations called AGOA , the African Growth and Opportunity Act , and that is working . \nI just announced a $ 674 million food relief package . \nWe 're spending $ 15 billion on HIV\\/Aids . \nNo , we 're leading the world when it comes to helping Africa . \nBut we 've done something else that I think is smart and I think our taxpayers appreciate . \nAnd that is that we 're saying , ` Now , for increased aid , you , the leaders of Africa , must have transparency in your government , you must fight corruption , you must invest in the health and education of your people . ' \nIn other words , we 're not going to invest in governments that are corrupt . \nTONIGHT : So this is aid with strings attached ? \nPRESIDENT BUSH : No , this is aid - this is partnership . \nThis is saying to nations we want to work with you as partners , partners in alleviating poverty , partners in helping fight HIV\\/Aids . \nBut you 've got a role to play - you , the leaders of African nations , you 've got a role to play to make good governance decisions . \nThat 's what the taxpayers of my country expect . \nAnd I hope that 's what the taxpayers of Great Britain expect , is expect us to , when we make investments in countries , that they work . \nAnd they do n't work if a nation does n't invest in its people . \nTONIGHT : I hear what you say about tripling the aid to Africa , but it 's still only - it 's less than 0.2 % of gross domestic national product . \nAnd that is less than what the United Nations talks about , of having 0.7 % . \nSome European countries are moving towards that . \nWhy ca n't America ? \nPRESIDENT BUSH : You know , there 's all kinds of ways to calculate how generous we are . \nLet me just tell you this : if you take all the food aid , America is by far the most generous country . \nIf you take the direct aid , we 're very generous . \nBut when you add on our private contributions - see , our tax system encourages private citizens to donate to organizations that , for example , help the folks in Africa . \nAnd when you take the combined effort of US taxpayers ' money plus US citizens ' donations , we 're very generous . \nAnd we 'll do more . \nAnd I look forward to talking about doing more at the G8 . \nBut I 've got to tell you , I 'm very proud of the generosity of the United States . \nTONIGHT : Mr President , on the question of trade , how can it be morally justified for the world 's richest country to subsidise its farmers so that they can sell their goods cheaper than farmers in the developing world , and , as a result , put those farmers in the developing world out of business ? \nPRESIDENT BUSH : That 's precisely the question we 've been talking to the EU about . \nThere are tremendous agricultural subsidies in the EU . \nWe - TONIGHT -LRB- INTERRUPTING -RRB- : Yes , but , I put those questions to the EU , if I were talking to somebody in the EU , but - PRESIDENT BUSH : No , let me - let me finish , let me finish . \nI was about to say , we 've got agricultural subsidies , not nearly to the extent that our friends in the EU have , and therefore , we went to Doha round , WTO - Doha round of the WTO and said , ` Let 's get rid of all our subsidies together . \nLet 's join hands as wealthy industrialised nations and say to the world , we 're going to get rid of all our agricultural subsidies together . ' \nAnd so the position of the US government is , we 're willing to do so , and we will do so with the - with our fine friends in the European Union . \nTONIGHT : So you would if they would , because at the moment , for example - TONIGHT : - cotton farmers in this country get subsidised to the extent of $ 230 per cotton acre . \nYou would get rid of those things if the EU does ? \nPRESIDENT BUSH : Absolutely . \nAnd I think we have an obligation to work together to do that . \nAnd that 's why it 's very important that the Doha round of the WTO go forward . \nTONIGHT : Because if we do achieve this business of free trade , and if markets in the west are opened up to countries in Africa , say , they could be so successful , then , that they could eliminate the need for aid . \nPRESIDENT BUSH : Absolutely . \nThat 's the whole reason why we 've got the African Growth and Opportunity Act . \nAs a matter of fact , the benefits that have come from opening up markets - our markets to them and their markets to us - far outweigh the benefits of aid . \nTONIGHT : Mr President , if I can move on to the question of Iraq , when we last spoke before the Iraq war , I asked you about Saddam Hussein and you said this , and I quote : `` He harbors and develops weapons of mass destruction , make no mistake about it . '' \nWell , today , no WMD , the war has cost 1,700 American lives , many more Iraqi civilians killed , hundreds of billions of dollars in cost to your country . \nCan you understand why some people in your country are now beginning to wonder whether it was really worth it ? \nPRESIDENT BUSH : Absolutely . \nI mean , when you turn on your TV set every day and see this incredible violence and the havoc that is wreaked as a result of these killers , I 'm sure why people are getting discouraged . \nAnd that 's why I spoke to the nation last night and reminded people that this is a - Iraq is a part of this global war on terror . \nAnd the reason why foreign fighters are flocking into Iraq is because they want to drive us out of the region . \nSee , these folks represent an ideology that is based upon hate and kind of a narrow vision of mankind - women do n't have rights . \nAnd I believe this is an ideological movement . \nAnd I know that they want to use suicide bombers and assassinations and attacks on the World Trade Centre , and the attacks in Madrid , to try to shake our will and to achieve an objective , which is to topple governments . \nAnd the best way to defeat an ideology is with a better ideology . \nAnd I believe democracy is a better ideology , to provide hope for people and - but yes , it 's tough . \nBut we 've done tough things before in America . \nAnd we 've got a great ally in Great Britain . \nBut it 's not only Great Britain . \nAs Gerhard Schrder said in the Oval Office , a democratic Iraq is important not only to Germany , but to Europe , and he 's right . \nForeign fighters are traveling into Iraq to make it a front line in the war on terror . \nAnd I would rather defeat them there than face them in our own country . \nTONIGHT : Have you still - do you still think that you may have mismanaged , or do you think you may have mismanaged public expectations about a quick victory and a decisive ending to this war ? \nYou 've talked in optimistic terms . \nBut now , as you say , the carnage on the screens night after night seems - tell a different story . \nPRESIDENT BUSH : Well , certainly that 's a very powerful weapon for the terrorists , is to kill innocent men , women and children , and try to shake our will and conscience . \nAnd on the other hand , there is progress being made in Iraq . \nRemember , it was n't all that long ago that 8 million people went to the polls to vote . \nAnd you might remember the discussions prior to the vote . \nI had a lot of people saying , ` Well , they do n't know what they 're doing , the people do n't want to be free , certain people ca n't - they 're not going to - what makes you think they want democracy ? ' \nAnd all of a sudden , when given the chance , 8 million people voted . \nAnd now the political process is moving in parallel with the security process . \nAnd our strategy is to help the Iraqis stand up a viable government , to encourage them to get their constitution written , and to have the elections , to ratify the constitution , as well as a government under the constitution , and , at the same time , train Iraqis so they can fight . \nThat 's our strategy . \nAnd we 're making good progress . \nTONIGHT : Is the administration at sixes and sevens about the insurgency in Iraq ? \nThe vice-president said that we 're in the last throes , or seeing the last throes of the insurgency . \nDonald Rumsfeld comes up and says we could be there for five , eight , 10 , 12 years . \nWhich do you believe ? \nPRESIDENT BUSH : I believe that we will succeed in Iraq , because , one , the Iraqis want to live in a free society . \nTONIGHT : But how long will it take , Mr President ? \nPRESIDENT BUSH : And , two , that the Iraqis want to take the fight to the enemy . \nAnd people want me to put a timetable on things ; that 's a huge mistake . \nPutting a timetable on this - on our stay there in Iraq simply emboldens the enemy and discourages our friends . \nAnd so , therefore , my answer is just , quickly as possible , and we are making progress . \nTONIGHT : Do you ever think maybe this was not such a good idea ? \nPRESIDENT BUSH : No , I 'm actually confident it 's the right thing to do . \nTONIGHT : You have never had any doubts at all about it ? \nPRESIDENT BUSH : I am absolutely confident that we made the right decision . \nAnd not only that , I 'm absolutely confident that the actions we took in Iraq are influencing reformers and freedom lovers in the greater Middle East . \nAnd I believe that you 're going to see the rise of democracy in many countries in the broader Middle East , which will lay the foundation for peace . \n"}

Foreign affairs editor Peter Beaumont in Baghdad uncovers a grim trail of abuse carried out by forces loyal to the new Iraqi government Sunday 3 July 2005 02.22 BST The video camera pans across Hassan an-Ni ` ami 's body as it is washed in the mosque for burial . \nIn life he was a slender , good-looking man , usually dressed in a dark robe and white turban , Imam at a mosque in Baghdad 's Adhimiya district and a senior official of the Muslim Clerics Association . \nWhen I first interviewed him a year ago he was suspected of contacts with the insurgency . \nCertainly he supported resistance to US forces . \nMore recently , an-Ni ` ami had dropped out of sight . \nThen , a little over a month ago , relatives say , paramilitary police commandos from ` Rapid Intrusion ' found him at a family home in the Sha'ab neighborhood of northern Baghdad . \nHis capture was reported on television as that of a senior ` terrorist commander ' . \nTwelve hours later his body turned up in the morgue . \nWhat happened to him in his 24 hours in captivity was written across his body in chapters of pain , recorded by the camera . \nThere are police-issue handcuffs still attached to one wrist , from which he was hanged long enough to cause his hands and wrists to swell . \nThere are burn marks on his chest , as if someone has placed something very hot near his right nipple and moved it around . \nA little lower are a series of horizontal welts , wrapping around his body and breaking the skin as they turn around his chest , as if he had been beaten with something flexible , perhaps a cable . \nThere are other injuries : a broken nose and smaller wounds that look like cigarette burns . \nAn arm appears to have been broken and one of the higher vertebrae is pushed inwards . \nThere is a cluster of small , neat circular wounds on both sides of his left knee . \nAt some stage an-Ni ` ami seems to have been efficiently knee-capped . \nIt was not done with a gun - the exit wounds are identical in size to the entry wounds , which would not happen with a bullet . \nInstead it appears to have been done with something like a drill . \nWhat actually killed him however were the bullets fired into his chest at close range , probably by someone standing over him as he lay on the ground . \nThe last two hit him in the head . \nThe gruesome detail is important . \nHanging by the arms in cuffs , scorching of the body with something like an iron and knee-capping are claimed to be increasingly prevalent in the new Iraq . \nNow evidence is emerging that appears to substantiate those claims . \nNot only Iraqis make the allegations . \nInternational officials describe the methods in disgusted but hushed tones , laying them at the door of the increasingly unaccountable forces attached to Iraq 's Ministry of the Interior . \nThe only question that remains is the level of the co-ordination of the abuse : whether Iraq is stumbling towards a policy of institutionalised torture or whether these are incidents carried out by rogue elements . \nSix months ago , Human Rights Watch -LRB- HRW -RRB- laid out a catalogue of alleged abuses being applied to those suspected of terrorism in Iraq and called for an independent complaints body in Iraq . \nBut as the insurgency has grown hotter , so too , it appears , have been the methods employed in the dirty counter-insurgency war . \nTo add to HRW 's allegations of beatings , electric shocks , arbitrary arrest , forced confessions and detention without trial , The Observer can add its own charges These include the most brutal kinds of torture , with methods resurrected from the time of Saddam ; of increasingly widespread extra-judicial executions ; and of the existence of a ` ghost ' network of detention facilities - in parallel with those officially acknowledged - that exist beyond all accountability to international human rights monitors , NGOs and even human rights officials of the new Iraqi government . \nWhat is most shocking is that it is done under the noses of US and UK officials , some of whom admit that they are aware of the abuses being perpetrated by units who are diverting international funding to their dirty war . \nHassan an-Ni ` ami may well have been a terrorist . \nOr he may have had knowledge of that terrorism . \nOr he may have been someone who objected too loudly to foreign troops being in Iraq . \nWe will never know . \nHe had no opportunity to defend himself , no lawyer , no trial . \nHis interrogation and killing were a breach of international law . \nAnd it is not only the case of an-Ni ` ami but others too , all arrested by units of the Ministry of the Interior , many of whom were tortured and subsequently killed . \nPost-mortem images show a dozen or so farmers from the insurgent hotbed of Medayeen who were apparently seized by police as they slept in one of Baghdad 's markets and whose bodies were discovered on a rubbish dump in shallow graves to the north of the city . \nLike an-Ni ` ami , their bodies also bore the marks of extensive torture before execution , most with a bullet to the head . \nThe face of the first body is blackened by strangulation or asphyxiation . \nAnother has bruises to his forehead where he was been hit repeatedly with something heavy . \nYet another , his hands still tied with cord , has been punched in the eye and had his ankle fractured . \nYet another shows signs of burning similar to an-Ni ` ami 's . \nThe last two have identical puncture wounds , fist-width apart , suggesting the use of a spiked knuckle-duster . \nThen there is Tahar Mohammed Suleiman al-Mashhadani , seized from the Abu Ghraib neighborhood from early prayers outside a mosque with a number of other men , again by paramilitary police from Rapid Intrusion . \nWhen his body was found by family members in the morgue - 20 days after his arrest - he had been tortured almost beyond recognition . \nThese are not isolated cases . \nFor what is extraordinary is the sense of impunity with which the torture , intimidation and murder is taking place . \nIt is not just in Baghdad . \nIn the majority Shia south , far from the worst ravages of the insurgency , there are also emerging reports consistent with the abuses in the capital . \nIf there is a center to this horror , it is Baghdad 's Ministry of the Interior , and the police commando units that operate from there . \nThe ministry is a strange , top-heavy building , set apart in an area of open ground off the highway . \nIts entrance is guarded by concrete blast-walls and endless checkpoints on the dusty road that leads to its crowded reception . \nI came here almost exactly a year ago , two days after sovereignty had been handed back to Iraq 's interim government . \nThe floors were occupied by civil servants and blue-uniformed officers of the Iraqi Police Service . \nIt was easy to wander in . \nThese days the ministry is a very different place . \nThe dusty hinterland that leads to it is busy with the new paramilitary forces that most often have been accused of human rights abuses - the Rapid Intrusion brigades , most notoriously the Wolf Brigade of ` Abu Walid ' . \nThere has been no investigation or official findings over the allegations . \nIt was here - 12 months ago - that there was the first intimation that something was going seriously wrong . \nOn the second day of Iraq 's new government , US military police were forced to raid the Guest House to ` rescue ' dozens of alleged criminals , scooped up in a sweep of the city , who were being subjected to beatings and forced confessions of their crimes . \nBack then officials were happy to justify the violence - and angry at the US intervention . \nCriminals and terrorists expected a good beating , one official said , proud of his 100 per cent confession rate . \nNow it is impossible to reach those officials as they shelter on heavily guarded floors . \nThere are no American MPs to come to the aid of those locked in the cells . \nA year ago , the worst violence was meted out in the Guest House . \nNow officials say the abuse happens on the seventh floor , where those suspected of terrorist connections are brought . \nOne of those held at the ministry for ` terrorist interrogation ' is ` Zaid ' . \nIt is not his real name . \nSince his release , the 25-year-old Sunni from the western suburbs of Baghdad lives in fear of being brought back . \nA taxi driver , the college graduate stopped his car in March to buy food in a market . \nWhen a bomb exploded nearby , he went to look at the damage . \nArrested at the scene by soldiers from the Iraqi National Guard , he says he was handed over to the Ministry of the Interior . \nAt first , said Zaid , he was put in a room , on the seventh floor , measuring 10ft by 12ft , with 60 others . \nHe was crammed in so tightly he could not sit . \nIn some respects Zaid was lucky . \nEarly in his detention , a Ministry of Justice official appeared and , furious at the conditions , demanded the men be moved . \n` He said , `` You ca n't have this many people in a room this size , '' so they moved us to somewhere with more air and fed us . \nHe asked too whether there had been any beatings and some said yes . ' \nFor his part , Zaid says he was hung by his arms , but not for so long that it caused any permanent damage . \nHis ordeal was largely to be subjected to threats of violence as up to eight guards circled him during his interrogation . \nBut Zaid claims he witnessed what happened to men brought from another detention facility , a barracks run by the Wolf Brigade , who were kept in the same area as Zaid until his parents paid a hefty bribe for his release . ' \nI saw men from Samarra -LRB- another insurgent stronghold -RRB- and from Medayeen . \nSome appeared to have wounds to their legs , ' he recalled . \n` There were others who could not use their spoon properly . \nThey had to hold it between their palms and move their heads to the spoon . ' \nHis month in the ministry terrified Zaid . \nIf the police came again for him , he said , he would rather throw himself off a balcony than go back . \nZaid is not the first detainee to accuse the police of taking bribes for the release of prisoners . \nIt is a common charge , as are descriptions of prisoners being brought from other , less accountable , interrogation facilities where the worst of the violence is taking place . \nWhat is most important about Zaid 's testimony is that it makes clear a link exists between the Ministry of Interior and the torture being conducted out of sight at other centres . \nIraqi and international officials named several of these centres , including al-Hadoud prison in the Kharkh district of Baghdad . \nA second torture center is said to be located in the basement of a clinic in the Shoula district , while the Wolf Brigade is accused of running its own interrogation center - said to be one of the worst - at its Nissor Square headquarters . \nOther places where abusive interrogations have been alleged include al-Muthana airbase and the old National Security headquarters . \n` Abu Ali ' , a 30-year-old Sunni scooped up in a mosque raid in central Baghdad , was taken to the latter for a week in mid-May where he says he was beaten on his feet , subjected to hanging by his arms and , when he angered his guards by refusing to confess , threatened with being sat on ` the bottle ' - being anally penetrated . \nIt is not just in Baghdad . \nCredible reports exist of Arab prisoners in Kirkuk being moved to secret detention facilities in Kurdistan , while other centres are alleged in Samarra , in the Holy Cities and in Basra in the south . \n` There are places we can get to and know about , ' said one Iraqi official . \n` But there are dozens of other places we know about where there is no access at all . ' \n` It is impossible to keep track of detentions , and what is happening to people when they are taken away , ' complained one foreign official involved in trying to building Iraq 's respect for human rights . \n` On top of that we have a whole culture that is permitting torture . \nThe impression is the judiciary are simply not interested in responding to the issue of human rights . \nIt is depressing . ' \nBut it is not simply the issue of keeping track of where detainees are being taken that is a problem . \nAccountability has also become more opaque since the formation of the Shia-dominated government of Ibrahim Jaffari with ministers and senior officials at the Ministry of the Interior refusing to meet concerned international organizations including Human Rights Watch . \n` We have been trying to break through to someone responsible to express our concerns , ' said another international official . \n` But it is impossible to meet the people we really need to see . \nWhat is so worrying is that allegations concerning the use of drills and irons during torture just keep coming back . \nAnd we have seen precisely the same evidence of torture on bodies that have turned up after they have been arrested . \nThere is a dirty counter-insurgency war , led on the anti-insurgency side by groups responsible to different leaders . \nPeople are not appearing in court . \nInstead , what is happening to them is totally arbitrary . ' \nThere is a significance to all this that goes beyond the everyday horror of today 's Iraq . \nIn the absence of weapons of mass destruction , the human rights abuses of Saddam Hussein 's regime became more important as a subsidiary case for war . \nIt has been a theme that has been constantly reiterated : it was horrific then , and it is better now . \nThe second may still just be true . \nIn many aspects there may be some improvement , but the trajectory of Iraq now on human rights is in danger of undermining that last plank of justification . \nTrue , there is a question of scale of the abuses . \nWhat is also different from Saddam 's era is that Iraq is now host to multinational troops , to huge UK and US missions , and is a substantial recipient of foreign aid , including British and EU funds . \nBritish and US police and military officials act as advisers to Iraq 's security forces . \nForeign troops support Iraqi policing missions . \nWhat is extraordinary is that despite the increasingly widespread evidence of torture , governments have remained silent . \nIt is all the more extraordinary on the British side , as embassy officials have been briefed by senior Iraqi officials over the allegations on a number of occasions and individual cases of abuse have been raised with British diplomats . \nIn Iraq 's Ministry of Human Rights , close to the Communications Tower and the location of one of the secret interrogation centres , they were marking the international day for the victims of torture . \nAs officials gathered for chocolate cake and cola under posters that read ` Non to torture ' , some senior officials are in no doubt that torture in their country is again getting worse . \nThe deputy minister , Aida Ussayran , is a life-long human rights activist who returned from exile in Britain to take up this post . \nShe concedes that abuses by Iraq 's security forces have been getting worse even as her ministry has been trying to re-educate the Iraqi police and army to respect detainee rights . \n` As you know , for a long time Iraq was a mass grave for human rights , ' she says . \n` The challenge is that many people who committed these abuses are still there and there is a culture of abuse in the security forces and police - even the army - that needs to be addressed . \nI do not have a magic solution , but what I can do is to remind people that this kind of behavior is what creates terrorists . ' \nThere is a sense of frustration too in the Ministry of Human Rights , for even as the security forces rapidly increase in size , the ministry tasked with checking abuses has only 24 monitors to pursue cases , at a time when officials believe it needs hundreds to keep Iraq 's police and army effectively in check . \nIf Ussayran is robust about her country 's problems with human rights abuses , others are convinced that , far from being the acts of rogue units , the abuse is being committed at the behest of the ministry itself - or at least senior officials within it . \n` There are people in the ministry who want to use these means , ' said one . \n` It is in their ideology . \nIt is their strategy . \nThey do not understand anything else . \nThey believe that human rights and the Convention against Torture are stupid .

{"id": "321", "time": "2005-04-12", "text": "Tuesday 12 April 2005 01.52 BST A report to the UN human rights commission in Geneva has concluded that Iraqi children were actually better off under Saddam Hussein than they are now . \nThis , of course , comes as a bitter blow for all those of us who , like George Bush and Tony Blair , honestly believe that children thrive best when we drop bombs on them from a great height , destroy their cities and blow up hospitals , schools and power stations . \nIt now appears that , far from improving the quality of life for Iraqi youngsters , the US-led military assault on Iraq has inexplicably doubled the number of children under five suffering from malnutrition . \nUnder Saddam , about 4 % of children under five were going hungry , whereas by the end of last year almost 8 % were suffering . \nThese results are even more disheartening for those of us in the Department of Making Things Better for Children in the Middle East By Military Force , since the previous attempts by Britain and America to improve the lot of Iraqi children also proved disappointing . \nFor example , the policy of applying the most draconian sanctions in living memory totally failed to improve conditions . \nAfter they were imposed in 1990 , the number of children under five who died increased by a factor of six . \nBy 1995 something like half a million Iraqi children were dead as a result of our efforts to help them . \nA year later , Madeleine Albright , then the US ambassador to the United Nations , tried to put a brave face on it . \nWhen a TV interviewer remarked that more children had died in Iraq through sanctions than were killed in Hiroshima , Mrs Albright famously replied : `` We think the price is worth it . '' \nBut clearly George Bush did n't . \nSo he hit on the idea of bombing them instead . \nAnd not just bombing , but capturing and torturing their fathers , humiliating their mothers , shooting at them from road blocks - but none of it seems to do any good . \nIraqi children simply refuse to be better nourished , healthier and less inclined to die . \nIt is truly baffling . \nAnd this is why we at the department are appealing to you - the general public - for ideas . \nIf you can think of any other military techniques that we have so far failed to apply to the children of Iraq , please let us know as a matter of urgency . \nWe assure you that , under our present leadership , there is no limit to the amount of money we are prepared to invest in a military solution to the problems of Iraqi children . \nIn the UK there may now be 3.6 million children living below the poverty line , and 12.9 million in the US , with no prospect of either government finding any cash to change that . \nBut surely this is a price worth paying , if it means that George Bush and Tony Blair can make any amount of money available for bombs , shells and bullets to improve the lives of Iraqi kids . \nYou know it makes sense . \nTerry Jones is a film director , actor and Python . \nHe is the author of Terry Jones 's War on the War on Terror Letters for publication should be sent to : letters@guardian.co.uk If you need help using the site : userhelp@guardian.co.uk Call the main Guardian and Observer switchboard : This article was published on guardian . \n"}

though in some cases - notably that of the legal memoranda - partial leakage prompted full disclosure . \nNothing much seems to have been obtained under the Freedom of Information Act . \nFor Iraqis , already accustomed to unspeakable things happening to anyone detained by Saddam 's police in Abu Ghraib , little can have changed . \nBut one of America 's leading legal journalists , Anthony Lewis of the New York Times , in an illuminating introduction to The Torture Papers , draws out the grim moral that - in the words of the former national security adviser to George Bush senior , Donald Gregg - it was the legal memoranda that `` cleared the way for the horrors that have been revealed '' in the US-run detention facilities . \nThese books contain extensive evidence that Lewis and Gregg are right . \nThey include a mass of depositions and reports about what was going on in the detention facilities . \nReading the detailed and objective findings of investigating officers , one begins to wonder whether the brutality was not in truth the rogue activity of a few privates , corporals and paramilitaries , while the legal sanctioning of torture thousands of miles away in Washington had more to do with the sophisticated techniques taught over many decades by the US Special Forces and CIA to client dictatorships . \nBut it becomes inexorably apparent that the crude use of fear and pain on detainees was not simply the localized abuse of absolute power by individuals unfit to hold it . \nStripping Iraqi men of their clothing and making them wear women 's underwear for days on end , or setting dogs on them when naked , makes a precise fit with the official doctrine that anything short of killing and maiming is a legitimate way of breaking people down for interrogation . \nEvidence has crept out of Afghanistan of the use of similar techniques there . \nDanner , in one of his own New York Review of Books articles which introduce his volume , traces `` water-boarding '' -LRB- repeated near-drowning -RRB- from the French war in Algeria through the dirty war in Argentina to the interrogation since 9\\/11 by CIA operatives of `` high value '' suspects in locations which have never been disclosed . \nDoes even a democracy have nevertheless to countenance such methods when its back is to the wall ? \nOther democracies have not thought so : many of their governments have refused to pass illiberal laws in response to terrorism , and where some have sought to do so their judiciaries have pointed out that if the reaction to terrorists is to abandon the rule of law , terrorism will have achieved an irreversible victory . \nThe supreme court of India in 2003 held that India 's prevention of terrorism laws must respect the fundamental human rights recognized in the constitution . \nThe Israeli supreme court , under its remarkable president Aharon Barak , has - not too successfully , it must be said - told the government and army in a series of judgments that while democracy is fated to fight with one hand tied behind its back , `` none the less , it has the upper hand . \nPreserving the rule of law and recognition of individual liberties ... strengthen its spirit , and this strength allows it to overcome its difficulties '' . \nIn this country the law lords , rejecting the legacy of wartime decisions permitting arbitrary executive detention , have found detention without trial a greater evil than the evil it is intended to challenge . \nPerhaps the strongest evidence that the abuse of prisoners in US hands has been systemic , not aberrant , is the simplest : it is the fact that those involved felt it was quite safe to be photographed repeatedly while committing it . \nPersonnel who fear disciplinary reprisal , or even disapproval , do not usually make a visual record of their conduct . \nIf it says something for Donald Rumsfeld , the defense secretary , that he twice tendered his resignation over the Abu Ghraib disclosures , it says rather more about the Bush administration that his offer was on both occasions rejected . \nThe outcome of the events tracked in these two books , for which both men bear responsibility , is a world order of which the icon has become a hooded figure , its arms outstretched in torment . \nThe apologists who blame a few bad apples in the barrel might do well to remember what a few bad apples do : they make the whole barrel rotten . \nStephen Sedley is a judge of the court of appeal for England and Wales Letters for publication should be sent to : letters@guardian.co.uk If you need help using the site : userhelp@guardian.co.uk Call the main Guardian and Observer switchboard : Review : The Torture Papers and Torture and Truth This article appeared on p14 of the Guardian review section of the Guardian on 01.27 GMT on Saturday 5 March 2005 Latest news and views from the Guardian 's books team paullaity : Read this : clever and funny and rightly cutting . \n"}

'' \nTariq Aziz , the former deputy prime minister who has been in jail since the US invasion of Iraq , allegedly told the investigation the oil had been allocated in the name of two of Mr Galloway 's agents , one of whom was Fawaz Zureikat . \nHowever , he added : `` These oil allocations were for the benefit of George Galloway and for Mariam 's Appeal . \nThe proceeds from the sale benefited the cause and Mr Galloway . '' \nMr Aziz is one of the primary witnesses mentioned in the new Senate investigation . \nIt quotes him as authenticating a letter supposedly sent by the head of Iraqi intelligence detailing a meeting between Mr Galloway , Mr Zureikat and an unnamed intelligence officer during which the MP is said to have asked for an increased oil allocation . \nThe letter was published in the Daily Telegraph in 2003 . \nMr Galloway successfully sued the newspaper , which is currently appealing against the ruling . \nAccording to the new report , Mr Aziz `` stated that he recognized the ... letter and recalled seeing it in the past '' . \nMr Aziz also allegedly told investigators that Mr Galloway had expressed concern to him about `` the appearance of taking money directly from the Iraqi government '' , and asked for his and his wife 's name to be omitted from official documents . \nHowever , the report found that several documents , authenticated by former regime officials , did mention Mr Galloway by name . \nThe report quoted the former Iraqi vice-president Taha Yasin Ramadan saying Mr Galloway , who is now an MP for the Respect party , was a `` friend of Iraq '' who `` needed to be compensated for his support '' . \n`` Galloway needed money to pay for his actions , '' Mr Ramadan allegedly told investigators , adding `` we gave him oil to sell to make the money '' . \nAccording to the report , the claim was confirmed by the former minister of oil , Amer Rashid . \nMr Galloway 's wife , Dr Abu Zayyad , from whom he is estranged , could not be contacted last night . \nBut she is quoted in the report as denying having received any money . \nMr McKay challenged the validity of the statements made by Mr Aziz and Mr Ramadan . \n`` Tariq Aziz has been in custody and we know from his lawyer this senate committee offered him a deal - just what I do not know , whether reduced charges or freedom - and it is ironic that Tariq Aziz , Yasin and Saddam are being accused , on the one hand , of being homicidal maniacs and on the other of being relied upon to give a true and accurate statements uncoerced .

'' \nThat 's no surprise when the army is up against the likes of Cindy Sheehan , who is camped outside George Bush 's Texas ranch in protest at the death of her son in Iraq . \nMedia coverage of returning casualties from Iraq , such as this powerful piece in the Washington Post does the US army no favors either . \nGiven this unpromising context , Business Week reports that the army will spend more money on recruitment ads next year , about $ 320m up from $ 240m this year . \nAs it helpfully points out this amounts to $ 4,000 per recruit if the army signs up 80,000 next year - more than twice what Toyota spends to woo a new customer . \nAs part of this marketing drive , the army has plans for 15 televised town hall meetings in which carefully selected soldiers will put a positive spin on the US presence in Iraq and Afghanistan . \nMeanwhile TV ads will target parents with one featuring a mother 's voice-over : `` Thanks for bringing the best out the best in my child . '' \nFor those keeping tabs on the Pentagon 's recruitment efforts , the CounterRecruiter website , a project of the Indypendent , the newspaper of the New York City Independent Media Center , provides useful information , including the army 's controversial attempts to recruit from schools and universities . \nYet while the army struggles to fill its ranks , this appears not to be the case with the navy , air force and Marines . \nAccording to Strategy Page , a site specialising on military issues as its name indicates , the army seems to be having trouble attracting those applicants who were unable to get into the other services . \nJames Dunnigan , the editor in chief of Strategy Page , also notes that the army is having no trouble getting people who have served in Iraq to re-enlist . \nBy the end of the year , the army expects to get 4,000 more re-enlistments than it expected , he writes . \nYet even he does not deny that the army is having trouble getting new recruits . \nGiven the situation , any idea of sending US troops to Iran must fill the army with dread . \n"}
{"id": "317", "time": "2005-10-22", "text": "This age of fanaticism is no time for non-believers to make enemies Humanists need to be less fussy about working with the religious who share our commitment to social justice The old story of Voltaire on his death bed is surely familiar . \nA priest bursts in on him crying , `` Renounce the devil and all his works ! '' \nVoltaire affably replies , `` This is no time to make enemies . '' \nThis time of terrorist and terror , real and imagined , is no time for non-believers to make enemies . \nFundamentalism and fanaticism are rife , but are being rejected or resisted within their own religions by most Christians and Muslims . \nIf we humanists are fully secure in our non-belief , scepticism and secularism , we can work together with those of all beliefs who fight against new or born-again enemies to freedom . \nWe should not confuse the pinpricks of religiosity -LRB- religious broadcasting on the BBC -RRB- or the specific body blows of even the modern Catholic church with the real threats to democracy , freedom and international law now posed by both Christian and Muslim fundamentalists . \nArchbishop Rowan Williams began a recent lecture on `` Law , Power and Peace '' with the scornful irony : `` The Iraq war was fought for the sake of freedom and democracy , so we are incessantly told . \nAnd ... whatever else may have resulted from that ill-fated enterprise , the present situation is not exactly freedom and democracy . '' \nThere was that huge , memorable anti-war demonstration , but also Rowan Williams speaking out in powerful and reasoned terms . \nI felt that he `` spoke for England '' then , just as Robin Cook spoke for real Labor . \nPart of the motivation of the religious who spoke against the war and the mad lack of foresight and preparation for pacification may indeed have been their religious beliefs ; but the substantive arguments were rational , prudential and moral in universal terms . \nLet me make a confession . \nAn admirably troublemaking body called the Citizen Organising Foundation is strong in the East End of London . \nThey campaign on issues of poverty , discrimination and empowerment . \nThey are an inter-faith body - Christians of many denominations , Jews , Muslims and Hindus . \nI met them through a common concern with citizenship education . \nThey stretched their ecumenicity by electing me , a vice-president of the British Humanist Association , as an honorary fellow at a ceremony at St Martin-in-the-Fields ; I risked a humanist blasphemy trial gladly , because all their practical actions were motivated by a morality of social justice . \nThat is what they had in common . \nOh yes , they speak , as do Rowan Williams and the Chief Rabbi , of morality needing a grounding in faith . \nBut their real religious differences , if insisted on at every turn , would render impossible their common commitment to concrete objectives of justice and human rights . \nThe great German theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer , killed by the Gestapo , famously argued in his prison letters for a religionless form of Christianity appropriate for the new secular world . \nSuch thinking was also that of Paul Tillich , and John Robinson 's book Honest to God was a pop version that so offended the pious tabloid editors . \nThe phrase `` secular Christianity '' , current for a while among Protestant theologians , led not surprisingly to some confusion . \nThe South African theologian and anti-apartheid activist John de Gruchy has revived the 16th-century usage of More and Erasmus to speak of `` Christian humanism '' . \nThis is not merely a commitment to social justice among all of us , religious and irreligious alike , but recognition that , through shared natural reason , politics is a secular activity . \nFor politics is inherently concerned with arbitration and compromise between differing values and interests , whereas the fundamentalist believes in a clear and literal truth in an ancient text and in a duty to impose truth on others . \nThere are bizarre similarities of belief between the fundamentalists of Protestantism and Islam . \nThey each believe we are in `` the last days '' and that Armageddon , the final victory or the `` Rapture '' is near at hand - so little need for the slow and tolerant processes of legal arbitration and political compromise . \nWe humanists do not need to mute our intellectual criticism of religion , but for social and political purposes we should work with those who can be the most effective combatants against fanaticism . \nTo work with those of other beliefs implies , of course , tact and courtesy to mute immediate criticism of what for the time and purpose at hand are irrelevancies . \nIt is historically and psychologically foolish for secularists to believe that criticism of all religious belief is an effective way of combating violent fanaticism . \nWe too can spend too much time preaching to the converted . \nAnd we do , up to a point , have a lot in common with most believers . \nRowan Williams earlier this year talked to the Citizen Organising Foundation on `` Who 's Bringing Up Our Children ? '' \n`` What are the characteristics you would regard as marks of maturity , or having grown up as a human being ? \n... A human adult is someone who believes that change is possible in their own lives and the lives of those around them . \nA human adult is someone who ... knows they are not right about everything , and that they wo n't live for ever . \nAn adult is someone sensitive to the cost of the choices they make for themselves and the people around them . \nAn adult is someone who is not afraid of difference ... who is aware of being answerable to something more than a cultural consensus - someone whose values and priorities are shaped by something other than majority votes ; which is why I add -LRB- but you would expect me to -RRB- that an awareness of the Holy is an important aspect of being an adult . '' \nWell , we would expect him to , would n't we ? \nBut his basic argument , like that of Bonhoeffer and John de Gruchy , is that political justice is a secular imperative . \nOur motivations may differ ; but surely we can respect differing motivations if they point to common action ? \nFor Rowan Williams asked : `` What if we live in an environment where apathy and cynicism are the default positions for most people on issues of public concern ? \n... What if our environment is passive to the culture of the global market , simply receiving that constant stream of messages which flows out from producers and marketeers ? '' \nThose questions used to be answered with moral authority by Labor governments , but now there is only New Labor 's moral vacuum . \nRowan Williams speaks with an impressive interrogating authority . \nPhilosophically he is a pluralist who can quote both the churchman Neville Figgis and the Jewish atheist Harold Laski . \nHumanists must assert the secularity and plurality of politics and citizenship ; but in doing this we should not assume all believers differ from us . \nChristian humanists also believe politics is part of the secular sphere -LRB- the natural law , not the divine law -RRB- . \nReligious fanaticism thrives domestically where there is either physical poverty or poverty of political and social ideals , and internationally where there is gross injustice . \nHumanists need to be more active in social policies and less fussy about the company we keep . \n"}

'' \nBarghouti is from the city of Ramallah , but lives in exile in Cairo . \nWhen I talked to him after his reading , he told me that he does not hate Israelis , but despises the stereotypes meted out to Palestinians . \nIn their brief introduction , the editors , Barnaby Rogerson and Rose Baring , describe current stereotypes of Muslims and Islamic culture as their motive for collating this book . \n`` Realising that the lies , half truths and manufactured fears by which this -LRB- Iraq -RRB- war had been sold to the public were backed by images of the Islamic world latched on to by our media - of bearded fanatics , suicide bombers and veiled gunmen - it seemed important to offer a truer , broader picture . '' \nThe result is an eclectic avalanche of travel literature : from memoirs to chance encounters , stories of unusual life-long friendships to physical and spiritual journeys . \nThe contributors are professional authors , as well as academics , film-makers , doctors , and translators , plus an Iranian singer-songwriter and an English sculptor who carves her work in stone . \nIndeed , one of the delights of this unusual book is the spectrum of writing styles it embraces . \nThese veer from the brisk , quintessentially English tone of Juliet Peck describing her friendship with the Afghan mujahideen commander Abdul Haq , to Shusha Guppy 's quietly reverential tale of a janitor at the Tehran theology college where her father used to teach . \nSome of the shortest stories of all encapsulate the most memorable meetings : Tahir Shah 's affectionate recollection of `` conversations paid for in postage stamps '' with his elderly Moroccan shanty town neighbor , or Peter Clark 's elegiac vignette about reuniting Wilfred Thesiger with his former traveling companion , Musallim bin al-Kamam . \nThe overall tone is more poignant and nostalgic than joyful . \nWar , revolution and foreign occupation have wreaked havoc across the Islamic world , especially in the past 20 years . \nA substantial number of the characters we are introduced to have since died . \nOthers have been maimed in recent invasions in the Middle East , Afghanistan and Iraq . \nIn `` The Girl from Gardez '' , Alberto Cairo describes meeting a young Afghan woman called Samar Gul , who has had one of her legs blown off by a bomb the Americans were supposedly aiming at the Taliban . \n`` Six members of Samar Gul 's family were killed . \nThe only survivors were herself and her younger sister . \nHer sister is not speaking to her : she can not forgive Samar Gul for saving her life by sending her out to draw water from the well just before the blast . '' \nThe majority of these stories have been written by white middle-class professionals , who remain very much the dominant commentators in our culture . \nIt would have been refreshing to have read more by non-British Muslims at home or abroad , and it is a shame that there are no contributions from the Balkans . \nBut ultimately this is an imaginative and timely collection . \nLouisa Waugh 's Hearing Birds Fly is published by Little , Brown . \nTo order Meetings With Remarkable Muslims for # 17.99 with free UK p & p call Guardian book service on 08708360875 . \nWrite your review of this or any other book , find out what other readers thought or add it to your lists Letters for publication should be sent to : letters@guardian.co.uk If you need help using the site : userhelp@guardian.co.uk Call the main Guardian and Observer switchboard : Review : Meetings With Remarkable Muslims edited by Barnaby Rogerson and Rose Baring This article appeared on p9 of the Guardian review section of the Guardian on 01.01 BST on Saturday 22 October 2005 Latest news and views from the Guardian 's books team paullaity : Read this : clever and funny and rightly cutting . \n"}

{"id": "334", "time": "2005-08-27", "text": "Opposing viewpoints of protesters gathered near George Bush 's ranch in Texas . \nPhoto : Joe Raedle\\/Getty The police tape fluttering gently marks the front line . \nOn one side sits a rag-tag collection of tents , home-made placards calling for the troops to come home and a long line of white crosses representing the soldiers killed in Iraq . \nOn the other side of the small country lane there is a smart collection of garden-style awnings filled with fold-out canvas chairs , lined with glossy placards proclaiming `` Bush Country '' , `` IM4W '' and `` Support Our Troops '' . \nA sign on the highway welcoming visitors to Crawford declares the population to be 705 , but today the figure is likely to be at least four times that . \nThousands of pro- and anti-war activists are making their way to this little corner of Texas for the culmination of protests that began when George Bush arrived for his five-week `` working vacation '' at the beginning of August . \nLeading the anti-war rally will be Cindy Sheehan , 48 , the mother of a soldier killed in Iraq , whose vigil outside Mr Bush 's ranch has given the US peace movement in America a new focus and forced the president on to the defensive . \nRanged against her are various conservative activists and military families , including the `` You Do n't Speak for Me , Cindy ! '' \ntour , which began in Mrs Sheehan 's home town of Vacaville in California and is due to arrive in Crawford at midday today . \nIts figurehead is Deborah Johns , the mother of a marine serving in Iraq . \nThe pro-war demonstrators will hold a rally in the little town , not far from Fort Qualls , which was set up in memory of Louis Qualls - a marine killed in Iraq last year but whose father , Gary , is a staunch Bush supporter . \nBetween them they are determined to drag the spotlight away from Mrs Sheehan , and today 's two rallies promise a showdown . \nWaiting at Camp Reality - the pro-war activists ' name for their headquarters - is Valerie Duty , 46 , a local resident who declares a little coquettishly that she is a `` friend '' of the president . \nShe is on the telephone when the Guardian arrives , trying to arrange a delivery of donated bottled water , a physical necessity in the wilting , 38C -LRB- 100F -RRB- heat . \n`` There has been a silent majority during the siege against our president , '' she says . \n`` But this weekend that majority is going to speak out . '' \nMrs Duty says she respects Mrs Sheehan 's right to do what she is doing , but says she does not speak for the majority of soldiers ' families . \n`` She is a nice woman , I have met her several times ... but she is being used by these leftwing groups who want to get at the president . '' \nMike Greenfield , 49 , from Colorado , agrees . \n`` They just hate Bush . \nThey are losers and they are bad losers . '' \nMr Greenfield criticises Mrs Sheehan 's connections with the leftwing group Moveon.org , and says he has heard that Michael Moore is helping to finance her campaign . \nAsked about the pro-war groups ' links with Move Forward America , which is sponsoring the `` You Do n't Speak For Us , Cindy ! '' \ntour , Mrs Duty says all their donations come from concerned individuals . \nNew York Times columnist Frank Rich describes the attacks as the `` swift boating '' of Cindy Sheehan , a reference to the campaign to discredit John Kerry 's Vietnam war record that was credited with derailing his presidential campaign . \nBut over at Camp Casey - named after Mrs Sheehan 's 24-year-old son - they accept the criticism as a badge of honor . \nAnne Wright , a career diplomat who resigned on the eve of the war , points out that the protest has come far from its start as three women sleeping in a car at the end of the road to Mr Bush 's ranch . \n`` There has always been a peace movement out there -LRB- but -RRB- finally we have managed to get some media attention , and it has given all those people out there a focal point . '' \nWhen Mrs Sheehan was forced to return home to California last week after her mother had a stroke , many expected the protest to fizzle out . \nBut by the time she returned on Wednesday it had grown . \nMost of the protesters have moved to a field donated by a local farmer , a stone 's throw away from the presidential ranch . \nA big white marquee has been erected and minibuses shuttle protesters in from Crawford . \nIn a kitchen area , volunteers prepare meals for up to 200 people , much of it with donated food - including 220kgs -LRB- 50lbs -RRB- of bison meat from a local farmer . \n`` I 'm a vegetarian cook but I was like , ` OK , I 'll cook meat for the revolution ' , '' said Rebekah Patrode , 28 , who drove 1,800 miles from Wendel in Massachusetts to be here . \nJoan Baez , the folk singer , came to talk to some of the families and ended up staying three nights , while organisers estimate that about 8,000 people have visited the site in the past three weeks . \nThey are expecting at least 1,000 to come this weekend before the camp packs up on Wednesday . \nConservatives have tried to dismiss the activists as the `` lunatic fringe '' of former Vietnam protesters , but not all are the usual suspects . \nLarry Donovan , 87 , has come 80 miles from his cattle ranch in Georgetown , Texas , to pay his respects to Mrs Sheehan . \n`` I just love her , '' he said , a cowboy hat protecting his head from the sun . \n`` With all the cheap politicians that we have it takes one lone woman to start something - but you know , I think that the politicians might just have to follow . '' \nOliver Utne , 21 , a student from Connecticut , is directing traffic outside the camp . \n`` People like Karl Rove -LRB- Mr Bush 's political chief adviser -RRB- have done very good job of convincing people that if you are a mainstream American then you have to be in favor of the war . \nWell , I 'm a mainstream American and I wanted to come here to show that you do n't have to be a wacko to be against the war . '' \nThe protesters at Camp Casey believe they are gaining ground . \nMrs Sheehan will begin a country-wide bus tour when she leaves Crawford , ending in Washington DC on September 24 for a long-planned anti-war march through the capital . \nIn reality , the turnout then will be a better barometer of public sentiment than which of the protests manage to mobilise the most support today . \n`` We hope that the people of America will use that event to put pressure on the White House and show in huge numbers the public angst and the need to end the war and stop killing people , '' Mrs Wright said . \n`` But you know , I feel we have the momentum now . \nI want to come here to show you do n't have to be whacko to be against the war .

'' There have been quite a few along the lines of that last remark , enough for the former marine captain to take a few security precautions at his new Washington home , and he admits to feeling the strain . \n`` It 's kind of hard for a guy who 's dedicated his entire adult life to the health and wellbeing of this country to be called a traitor by people who , I feel , have probably sacrificed a lot less than I have , '' he said . \nHe was talking in an elegant and quiet corner of Washington 's Army and Navy Club , where he still enjoys privileges , despite his choice of employer . \nHe dresses in the manner of many former officers on both sides of the Atlantic - a tweed jacket over a boldly striped shirt - and has the crispness in his talk and the direct gaze drilled into him at marine charm school . \nThose qualities , plus his degree in classic civilisations and ancient history , got him the job of presenting the Pentagon 's side of the Iraq war to the local media in Qatar 's capital , Doha . \nIt made him an unwitting star . \nAn Egyptian-American film-maker , Jehane Noujaim , was hanging around the media center with a video camera , and most of the officers , including the then Lieutenant Rushing , thought she was making a student film about media coverage of the war . \nBut her documentary , Control Room , became one of last year 's surprise hits . \nThe film is a largely sympathetic portrayal of al-Jazeera , but it also shines a bright light on the multi-million dollar publicity machine the Pentagon built in Doha . \nAmong all the gung-ho on-message military information officers , Lt Rushing stuck out . \nHe listened to what some of the Arab journalists were saying about the war and appeared to reconsider some of his assumptions . \nIn one memorable scene , he declared himself sickened by al-Jazeera 's decision to screen pictures of dead Americans , but then realized he was not as outraged to see Iraqi bodies on the same network the following evening . \n`` It upset me on a profound level that I was n't bothered as much as the night before , '' he said in the film . \n`` It makes me hate war . '' \nThe film caused an uproar , and abuse from military and militaristic types began to flood in . \nHis favorite was : `` Six months in the desert does n't make you fucking Lawrence of Arabia . '' \nRushing recalls : `` I saved that one , because I do n't claim to be Lawrence of Arabia - just a guy who says it may be worth us trying to understand their perspective . '' \nDisplaying an apparently genuine innocence , he still can not understand why the defense department was annoyed by the film , and why he was subsequently forbidden to talk to the press . \n`` The Pentagon missed an opportunity with my case in that movie , '' he says . \n`` I would have liked to have come out and said that there are a lot of people in the military that would have reacted in the same way in that film , trying to understand the other side and wanting to do the right thing . '' \nHe left the marines last August and spent some miserable months , unemployed and eating into his modest savings , before he accepted al-Jazeera 's offer . \nThe danger Rushing now faces is that he may be accused of going from one one-sided media operation to another . \nAfter all , he is shown in Control Room criticising al-Jazeera 's bias , comparing it to Fox News `` at the other end of the spectrum '' . \nHe admits that he is unaware whether al-Jazeera 's Arabic broadcasts have got any better . \n`` I do n't know where they 're at right now . \nI do n't get a chance to watch it , and if I could I do n't understand it , '' he says . \n`` I think there 's going to be a difficult time overcoming the brand in America . '' \nIt may turn out to be impossible . \nThe new English-language al-Jazeera International has yet to find a US cable outlet prepared to carry its broadcasts . \n"}

'' \nThe figure includes accidents . \nThe daily drip of US casualties passes almost unnoticed now , a footnote to the wider slaughter of Iraqis : five policemen killed in two car bombs yesterday , 13 soldiers killed on Wednesday , a judge on Tuesday , at least 115 police and army recruits and civilians on Monday . \nSome 18,000 civilians are estimated to have died . \nYesterday 's headlines were about the renewal of Iraq 's state of emergency , fresh attacks on oil pipelines , and deadlock between Shias and Kurds over forming a new government . \nThe men of Bravo company , an infantry unit which rides in the armored Stryker vehicles of 321 Battalion in Mosul , did not care that since George Bush 's re-election the artificial limbs and flag-draped coffins of US troops have faded in political significance . \nFor them , it was personal . \n`` I do n't tell my mom or my wife that we drive up and down streets getting blown up every day . \nThey 'd just worry all the time . \nI tell them we sit in the base and do the odd mission , '' said Sgt Nathan Purdy , who is 23 . \nA week embedded with Bravo company , midway through a year-long stint in an insurgent stronghold , showed a group of men with good morale and determination to catch `` bad guys '' but divided over the war and frustrated by an elusive enemy . \nThere was consensus about the reaction when home on leave . \n`` People wanting to buy you drinks , buy you food , wanting to shake your hand , they made you feel a hero , '' said Specialist Matt Sutton , 24 , from Illinois . \nThose from liberal states such as Washington said anti-war activists did not criticise them personally or echo the Vietnam-era chant of baby killer . \n`` The country is behind us . \nThey did n't dare , '' said one lieutenant . \nBravo Company 's quarters are a bombed-out palace in the grounds of Camp Freedom , a sprawl of cabins and concrete shelters . \nMortars land regularly but tend not to hit anything . \nLieutenant Colonel Mike Gibler said his battalion 's main objective was rebuilding the Iraqi security forces which `` imploded '' last November after insurgents overran Mosul 's police stations . \nThe Iraqi army was improving thanks to joint operations and would soon take half of the responsibility of securing the city . \nAsked about the police force he rolled his eyes , but speculated that there was enough progress for US forces to leave within three years . \nHis desk had tomes on Islam and a `` Do n't mess with Texas '' sticker . \nEnlisted men were less sure about progress , complaining they were always on the defensive and waiting to be attacked by insurgents . \n`` They fight like bitches , pop a few shots , then hide , '' said Sgt Ramirez Flores . \nDrive-by shootings have wounded several in the unit but the big fear is roadside bombs which according to the Pentagon accounted for 56 % of all US battle deaths in the first two months of this year . \nThey are hidden in rubbish bags , animal carcasses , holes , rubble , cars and carts , turning every object into a potential killer . \nA suicide car bomber rammed and immolated one of the battalion 's Strykers but all the occupants survived , prompting reverence for the eight-wheel , 23-tonne monsters . \nA tip about weapons caches this week led to a midnight mission to dig up a lawn . \n`` Fucking gardeners - what are we doing here ? '' \n`` And tomorrow we 're giving out candy to kids again , '' replied his friend . \n`` We did n't train for this . '' \n"}
{"id": "240", "time": "2005-04-13", "text": "Wednesday 13 April 2005 01.03 BST The number of soldiers to desert the army or go absent without leave has more than doubled over the past year , the Ministry of Defense has revealed . \nThere are now more than 500 soldiers whose whereabouts are unknown . \nThe rise coincided with the invasion of Iraq and its aftermath . \nIndependent sources said yesterday that the war was clearly a factor . \nHowever , the rising trend over four years suggests that other issues also played a part . \nThe number of soldiers still illegally absent last year totalled 530 , compared with 205 in 2003 , 150 in 2002 , and 100 in 2001 . \nThe figures show that soldiers went Awol more than 3,000 times last year , with only a third of that figure accounting for returns to base within 21 days . \nThe largest number of soldiers going Awol came from the infantry , followed by the Royal Logistic Corps and the Royal Artillery , according to the MoD . \nThe figures were released to Bob Russell , the Liberal Democrat MP for Colchester , a garrison town . \nThough he first asked for the information in January , the MoD did not respond until it was too late for him to pursue the matter . \nThe response to his original question came more than two months later in a letter from the armed forces minister , Adam Ingram . \n`` The mere fact they took so long to answer the question is significant , '' Mr Russell said yesterday . \nHe asked for the information after being told by a source that a growing number of soldiers disapproved of the government 's stand on Iraq . \nHe still has not seen Mr Ingram 's letter , which was addressed to the Commons on the last full working day of parliament and gives no explanation for the rise . \nThe MoD said yesterday that it was unable to comment . \nGilbert Blades , a lawyer representing Awol soldiers , said Iraq was `` probably the biggest factor '' . \nBut he said a growing number of young soldiers were also not prepared to `` suffer the indignities and discipline '' of army life . \nJustin Houston-Roberts , who also represents soldiers , said : `` There 's been a very noticeable increase of not only soldiers but airmen as well asking our advice on being absent without leave , '' he said . \n`` Some are subjected to horrific bullying and run away to save themselves ... There are huge amounts of reasons but the conflict in Iraq is significant . '' \nHe added : `` When the conflict started we had a very noticeable increase in requests to assist soldiers who wanted to leave the services or had done so without permission . \n`` I think Iraq has had an impact . \nIt 's not necessarily people who do n't want to fight but people who have found themselves in situations upon their return that they ca n't necessarily cope with . '' \nMark McGhee , another solicitor , said : `` Certainly from my experience of dealing with soldiers returning from Iraq , I would be very concerned about the fact that there 's been a doubling up of the numbers going Awol .

{"id": "221", "time": "2005-07-02", "text": "Roy Greenslade salutes Dilip Hiro 's Secrets and Lies , a depressing but magisterial assessment of the reasoning that led to the invasion of Iraq Millions across the world who marched in the hope of preventing the invasion of Iraq were angered by the fact that their opposition was ignored . \nIf they read this book their anger will be redoubled . \nBut the people who will surely feel even more embittered are those who were taken in , having been persuaded by the arguments of President Bush and Prime Minister Blair to support the war . \nDilip Hiro coolly dismantles the political lies , distortions and obfuscations that allowed the United States and Britain to launch an illegal invasion of Iraq . \nThat he does the job so meticulously - even , arguably , in too detailed a fashion on occasion - makes his overall indictment even more powerful than the scatter-gun approach of other war critics , such as Michael Moore . \nHiro brings to the subject a thorough knowledge of the Middle East , having written extensively about the region in several of his previous 26 books . \nHere is an author for whom , to paraphrase Bush 's secretary of defense , Donald Rumsfeld , there are no unknown unknowns . \nHe has made it his business to know exactly how Bush 's White House team managed to prosecute a war based on a giant fabrication . \nThat , of course , was the claim that Iraq 's dictator , Saddam Hussein , had defied the United Nations by holding on to weapons of mass destruction that presented a threat to global stability . \nIn order to support the central lie , to give it the semblance of credibility , there were scores of intertwined supporting lies . \nSaddam was not linked to al-Qaida and was not , therefore , responsible for 9\\/11 . \nHe did not buy uranium oxide from Niger . \nIraq did not have a fleet of unmanned aircraft nor did it have mobile labs to produce chemical and biological weapons . \nNor was it operating poison factories . \nHiro is painstaking as he holds up every piece of fake intelligence to scrutiny , revealing both its falsity and the propaganda use to which it was put . \nEvery excuse advanced by Bush and Blair for the invasion is shown to be hollow , as they seek to conceal the main reason for their pre-emptive strike : the desire for regime change . \nIn some of the most telling passages , Hiro reveals the key roles played by the sinister group who surrounded Bush , such as his deputy , Dick Cheney ; Rumsfeld 's deputy , Paul Wolfowitz ; the under secretary of defense , Douglas Feith ; the defense adviser Richard Perle ; the president 's chief political adviser , Karl Rove ; and , of course , the national security adviser , Condoleezza Rice . \nMeanwhile , the senior man , Colin Powell , the secretary of state , was largely isolated from Bush 's gung-ho squad . \nDespite his policy disagreements however , he performed important tasks on behalf of the warriors , none more so than his lengthy speech to the UN Security Council in the build-up to the invasion . \nHiro 's point-by-point rebuttal of Powell 's allegations is masterly . \nIn similar fashion he destroys the so-called evidence in Blair 's now infamous dossiers on WMD and the far-fetched claim about Iraq being able to deploy such weapons within 45 minutes . \nEvidently , even the Americans scoffed at the statement , though they grew less concerned themselves about the WMD reasoning because they had successfully convinced their public that Saddam was one of the 9\\/11 culprits . \nHiro mounts convincing evidence that Bush was determined to invade Iraq on virtually any pretext soon after his first election victory . \nHe also shows how , some seven months before the war , US special forces were operating within Iraq at the behest of Rumsfeld . \nTheir work was specifically linked to an invasion that had not even been raised with the UN and while its weapons inspectors were still carrying out their tasks with what later transpired to be great efficiency . \nThe geopolitical maneuvers are certainly riveting , but the more human , and inhuman , story emerges in the passages that tell of the invasion itself . \nThere are several examples of just how badly the civilian Iraqi population suffered as the Anglo-American forces swept through their country . \nBut the haunting moments come , just as they did in the revelations about the reality of the Vietnam war , when one discovers that neither politicians nor military leaders ever tell the truth . \nFor example , the Pentagon strenuously denied that it had used napalm in Iraq , despite an Australian correspondent witnessing its use . \nThat was n't napalm , said a spokesman , it was a Mark 77 firebomb . \nAs Hiro observes this statement was `` cynical sophistry '' , since the Mark 77 is a mixture of kerosene and polystyrene , while napalm is a mixture of jet fuel and polystyrene . \nThe result is just the same : death in a fireball . \nThere were also official denials about the use of lethal , and indiscriminate , cluster bombs . \nYet Hiro is not only able to state that 1,566 cluster bombs were dropped along with more than 20,000 cluster munitions , he also reproduces a map to show exactly where they were used . \nIn the greater scheme of things it was a small lie , just one among so many . \nThe promulgation of pre-war lies was followed by further lies during the war . \nNow Bush and Blair tell us that life in post-Saddam Iraq is improving . \nBut why should we believe them ? \n& # 183 ;

'' \nThe response in Baghdad yesterday was mixed . \nOne drink wholesaler , Abbas Salih , said the initiative was doomed . \n`` Coca-Cola does business with those who are shooting our brothers in Palestine , '' he said . \n`` How can we drink it ? '' \nAbu Ream , a shop owner in Baghdad , repeated a widespread conspiracy theory : `` If you hold up a Coke can to the mirror , the writing says ` No Allah ' , '' Mr Ream said . \n`` Or maybe ` No Mohammad ' . \nI ca n't remember which . '' \nBut Mr Ream said since supplies became available two years ago he had sold more Coke than Pepsi . \n`` People like the taste better . \nAnd they like the novelty . '' \nCoca-Cola denies any political or religious bias . \n`` The myth is indeed sometimes perpetuated , but has no truth to it , '' the spokesman said . \n`` We are a local business that employs local people ... Our Palestinian bottler employs 250 Palestinians . '' \nAfter the 1990 invasion of Kuwait , sanctions led the Iraqi licence holder , Baghdad Soft Drinks , to replace the authentic Pepsi concentrate it had used with fakes smuggled from eastern Europe . \nMatters were not helped when Saddam Hussein 's son Uday bought 10 % of the company . \nBut Baghdad Soft Drinks says Pepsi is rebuilding , with bottling operations in the capital and southern Iraq . \nIn the west , Coke and Pepsi have been targeted as US symbols . \nEntrepreneurs have produced alternatives such as Mecca-Cola and Muslim Up . \nBut in Iraq , hostility to the US is expressed more directly in attacks on US troops ; Sunni Arab insurgent sympathisers have no problem drinking and serving Pepsi . \n"}
{"id": "5", "time": "2005-08-21", "text": "A monster of our own making These British bombers are a consequence of a misguided and catastrophic pursuit of multiculturalism There is damaging confusion over the real nature of the terrorist threat and where it is located . \nIs it global or local ? \nIt undoubtedly is both , but the former is a distraction from the most serious problem , which lies in Europe . \nIn 2001 , following the 9\\/11 attacks , the American government called terrorism centrally directed and international , motivated by hatred of the West . \nIt was waging a ` war ' against the West , so the West must go to war against it . \nMany or most in Britain and Europe accepted this . \nAl-Qaeda , identified by Washington as international terrorism 's central authority , was said by the US and British governments to be linked to Saddam Hussein 's Iraq and certain other Middle Eastern governments . \nThe evidence linking the London , Sharm el-Sheik -LRB- so far as we know -RRB- and Madrid bombings to the surviving al-Qaeda leadership remains tenuous at best . \nIt is unclear whether al-Qaeda remains a group with a disciplined structure and the organisational capacity for international action . \nThanks to the internet , it communicates , but what is behind the communication ? \nThe most significant thing about Islamic terrorism today is that it is a politicosocial phenomenon among apparently self-motivated individuals and small groups . \nThey are volunteers in a loose international movement of religious revival and radicalisation that offers alienated young Muslims an explanation for the unsettling forces at work in their lives and a mission . \nThe argument that terrorism is an organised global menace continues to be put forward in Washington , although with fading conviction . \nIt is necessary as the justification for the Bush administration 's war in Iraq . \nIt is essential for Bush and Blair to be able to say that staying the course in Iraq can disable or end the terrorism practiced by young Muslims in Europe and elsewhere . \nThe argument ignores or implicitly denies the cultural and social sources of Islamic extremism in the West . \nFew today would seriously deny that the war in Iraq generates terrorist sympathies among members of Western Europe 's Muslim communities , as the Palestinian intifadas did . \nThe war clearly provides a continuing obstacle to the integration of these communities into the larger society , in Britain as elsewhere . \nEnding the war would remove the obstacle , but today would , quite rightly , be interpreted as defeat for the coalition . \nDespite the fact that the Iraqi resistance seems predominantly nationalist in motivation , the radical Islamists would claim credit for forcing the coalition 's withdrawal . \nMilitary withdrawal none the less is perfectly possible , since the evidence is overwhelming that foreign military occupation and the resistance are in symbiotic and symmetrical relationship , each reinforcing the other . \nIn any case , American public opinion has taken a sharp turn against the war , and finding a plausible exit is now the Bush administration 's priority . \nWithout one , the government will eventually confront the dire choice between conscription , politically ruinous to the Republicans , and a smokescreen-covered defeat , as in Vietnam . \nThis ` defeat ' , however , would transfer the problem of Islamic fundamentalism back to where it belongs , inside Islamic society itself . \nThere , the myth of a return to a glorious past will eventually be discredited . \nThe primary aim of the Islamic extremists is to radicalise Islamic society in order to purify it . \nTheir main concern with the West is to expel it and its influences from the Islamic world . \nThe radical leaders have no imaginable reason to want to conquer and try to rule the infidel West , even if they could . \nThe notion of al-Qaeda as a global force is mainly the result of America 's obsession with it . \nThe 11 September attacks gave a conservative American government just the challenge it wanted , having already a malevolent eye on the defiant Saddam Hussein and an ambition to establish new Middle Eastern strategic bases . \nThe attacks were immediately called a new Pearl Harbor , the start of a war more dangerous than the Cold War , waged by militants acting out of ` hatred for freedom ' - creating an emergency that required mobilisation of all the democracies under American leadership . \nYou are with us or against us . \nThe US reorganised its government to defend the ` homeland ' , drastically revised its security and immigration legislation , set up military courts of exception , denounced the Geneva Convention on the treatment of prisoners and the use of torture as ` no longer relevant ' , and suspended habeas corpus in certain security cases . \nIt attacked Afghanistan and Iraq . \nBlair 's Britain followed , contributing to the forces that eventually produced the London bombings . \nBritish police investigation presumes the London bombings on 7 July were carried out by young , British-born citizens , using materials easily obtained in supermarkets , hardware shops and beauty parlors . \nThe second round of attempted explosions still seems the work of young amateurs and their friends and family , intended ` to scare people ' . \nPolice asked of the first group : ` Who supported them ? \nWho encouraged them ? ' \nOn the evidence of previous bombings in Europe , it is reasonable to think that they supported , encouraged and financed one another , took their training from the internet , or from radicalised friends , and were inspired , one might say , by the zeitgeist . \nAyman al-Zawahiri , who says he is second in command of al-Qaeda , appeared on television to claim credit for it all and warn that worse is on the way . \nBut that is his practice . \nAyman al-Zawahiri , Tony Blair and George W Bush also exist in a symbiotic relationship . \nAll have a vested interest in terrorism as a centrally directed international threat -LRB- an Islamic Comintern -RRB- , at war everywhere with the West . \nHowever , many have already seen in it an international network of people with a common ideology and access to the internet ; some with , but most without , experience of Afghanistan under the Russians or Iraq under the coalition ; and some committing copycat crimes motivated by unarticulated motives of political-religious protest and moral dislocation . \nA half-century of a well-intentioned but catastrophically mistaken policy of multiculturalism , indifferent or even hostile to social and cultural integration , has produced in Britain and much of Europe a technologically educated but culturally and morally unassimilated immigrant demi-intelligentsia . \nLike the anarchists of the 19th and early 20th centuries , these people have no realisable goals and make no meaningful political demands , only Utopian ones . \nThus , like the anarchists , they must be called nihilists . \nFor that reason , they present a profound problem to governments accustomed to dealing with rationally manageable threats , enemies and demands . \nReason has no answer to nihilism . \nWilliam Pfaff 's most recent book is The Bullet 's Song : Romantic Violence and Utopia , published by Simon & Schuster . \n"}
{"id": "286", "time": "2005-08-17", "text": "The battle over the constitution is regarded by most Iraqi women , confined to their homes by the occupation , as an irrelevance Wednesday 17 August 2005 01.15 BST A prominent group of Iraqi women who backed the US-British invasion recently met the American ambassador in an effort to pressure the politicians drawing up Iraq 's constitution not to limit women 's rights . \nWestern feminist groups and some Iraqi women activists fear that Islamic law , if enshrined as a main source of legislation , will be used to restrict their rights , particularly in relation to marriage , divorce and inheritance . \nThe US claims to share this concern . \nIraqi women generally do not . \nTo understand why , perhaps we need to remember that this constitution is being written in a war zone , in a country on the verge of a civil war . \nThis process is designed not to represent the Iraqi people 's need for a constitution but to comply with an imposed timetable aimed at legitimising the occupation . \nThe drafting process has increasingly proved a dividing , rather than a unifying , process . \nUnder Saddam Hussein , we had a constitution described as `` progressive and secular '' . \nIt did not stop him violating human rights , women 's included . \nThe same is happening now . \nThe militias of the parties heading the interim government are involved in daily violations of Iraqis ' human rights , women 's in particular , with the US-led occupation 's blessing . \nWill the new constitution put an end to this violence ? \nMost Iraqi women try to cope sensitively with the predicament of dealing with the occupation and the rise of reactionary practices affecting their rights and way of life . \nThis applies across the political and class spectrum , to the secular left as much as to moderate Islamists and nationalists . \nMost also feel that the constitution is not their priority , and that those writing such a crucial document should be able to think clearly , to think of tomorrow . \nTo do that one must be free of today 's fears and able to enjoy basic human rights , such as walking safely in the streets . \nIraqi women can not . \nDespite all the rhetoric of `` building a new democracy '' , Iraqis are buckling under the burdens and abuse of the US-led occupation and its local Iraqi sub-contractors . \nDaily life for most Iraqis is still a struggle for survival . \nHuman rights under occupation have proved , like weapons of mass destruction , to be a mirage . \nTorture and ill-treatment - even the torture of children in adult facilities - is widespread . \nDepleted uranium and other banned weapons have been used against Iraqi cities by occupying troops . \nIraqi women were long the most liberated in the Middle East . \nOccupation has largely confined them to their homes . \nA typical Iraqi woman 's day begins with the struggle to get the basics : electricity , petrol or a cylinder of gas , water , food and medication . \nIt ends with a sigh of relief at surviving death threats and violent attacks . \nFor most women , simply to venture on to the street is to risk being attacked or kidnapped for profit or revenge . \nYoung girls are sold to neighbouring countries for prostitution . \nIn a land awash with oil , 16 million Iraqis rely on monthly food rations for survival . \nNone has been received since May . \nPrivatisation threatens free public services . \nAcute malnutrition among children has doubled . \nUnemployment , at 70 % , has fuelled poverty , prostitution , backstreet abortions and honor killings . \nCorruption and nepotism are rampant in the interim government . \nGender is no obstacle : Layla Abdul-Latif , the minister of transport in Ayad Allawi 's administration , is under investigation for corruption . \nA quota system imposed by Paul Bremer , the former head of the Coalition Provisional Authority , ensures women 's participation in the interim government , the national assembly and the committee appointed to write the constitution . \nIraqi women 's historical struggle against colonial domination , and for national unity , social justice and legal equality , has been reduced to bickering among a handful of `` women leaders '' over nominal political posts . \nPowerless , holed up in guarded areas , venturing out in daylight only with armed escorts , and lacking any credibility among Iraqi women , the failure of these `` leaders '' is catastrophic . \nLike their male colleagues , they have adopted a selective , largely US-oriented approach to human rights . \nThe suffering of their sisters in cities showered with napalm , phosphorus and cluster bombs by US jets , the death of an estimated 100,000 Iraqis -LRB- half of them women and children -RRB- , is met with rhetoric about training women for leadership and democracy . \nDocuments released in March by the American Civil Liberties Union highlight more than a dozen cases of rape and abuse of female detainees , and reveal that no action was taken against any soldier or civilian official as a result - and that US troops have destroyed evidence , to avoid a repetition of last year 's Abu Ghraib scandal . \nThe silence of female National Assembly members and interim-government and US-financed women 's NGOs is deafening . \nIn Iraq , `` women 's rights '' is an absurd discourse chewing on meaningless words . \nNo wonder that the US-funded NGOs , which preach western-style women 's rights and democracy , are regarded as vehicles for foreign manipulation and are despised and boycotted , even when they recruit liberal or left personalities . \nIraqi women know that the enemy is not Islam . \nThere is a strong antipathy to anyone trying to conscript women 's issues to the racist `` war on terror '' targeted against the Muslim world . \nMost Iraqi women do not regard traditional society , exemplified by the neighborhood and extended family , however restrictive at times , as the enemy . \nIn fact , it has in practice been the protector of women and children , of their physical safety and welfare , despite lowest-common-denominator demands on dress and personal conduct . \nThe enemy is the collapse of the state and civil society . \nAnd the culprit is the foreign military invasion and occupation . \nHaifa Zangana is an Iraqi-born novelist and former prisoner of Saddam 's regime ; a version of this article appeared in the Cairo weekly Al-Ahram Letters for publication should be sent to : letters@guardian.co.uk If you need help using the site : userhelp@guardian.co.uk Call the main Guardian and Observer switchboard : This article was published on guardian . \n"}
{"id": "124", "time": "2005-08-28", "text": "Secret document said UK seen as ` crusader state'Read the document here The Foreign Office 's top official warned Downing Street that the Iraq war was fuelling Muslim extremism in Britain a year before the 7 July bombings , The Observer can reveal . \nDespite repeated denials by Number 10 that the war made Britain a target for terrorists , a letter from Michael Jay , the Foreign Office permanent under-secretary , to the cabinet secretary , Sir Andrew Turnbull - obtained by this newspaper - makes the connection clear . \nThe letter , dated 18 May 2004 , says British foreign policy was a ` recurring theme ' in the Muslim community , ` especially in the context of the Middle East peace process and Iraq ' . \n` Colleagues have flagged up some of the potential underlying causes of extremism that can affect the Muslim community , such as discrimination , disadvantage and exclusion , ' the letter says . \n` But another recurring theme is the issue of British foreign policy , especially in the context of the Middle East peace process and Iraq . \n` Experience of both ministers and officials ... suggests that ... British foreign policy and the perception of its negative effect on Muslims globally plays a significant role in creating a feeling of anger and impotence among especially the younger generation of British Muslims . ' \nThe letter continues : ` This seems to be a key driver behind recruitment by extremist organizations -LRB- e.g. recruitment drives by groups such as Hizb-ut-Tahrir and al Muhajiroon -RRB- . \nThe FCO has a relevant and crucial role to play in the wider context of engagement with British Muslims on policy issues , and more broadly , in convincing young Muslims that they have a legitimate and credible voice , including on foreign policy issues , through an active participation in the democratic process . ' \nAl Muhajiroon , formed by Omar Bakri Mohammed , the radical preacher who fled Britain after the 7 July bombings , was a recruiting organization for young Islamic extremists in Britain . \nAttached to the letter is a strategy document , also obtained by The Observer , which reveals further concerns . \nIt says Britain is now viewed as a ` crusader state ' , on a par with America as a potential target . \n` Muslim resentment towards the West is worse than ever , ' the document , ` Building Bridges with Mainstream Islam ' , says . \n` This was previously focused on the US , but the war in Iraq has meant the UK is now seen in similar terms - both are now seen by many Muslims as `` Crusader states '' . \n` Though we are moving on from a conflict to a reconstruction phase in Iraq , there are no signs of any moderation of this resentment . \nOur work on engaging with Islam has therefore been knocked back . \nMr O'Brien -LRB- then a Foreign Office minister -RRB- has expressed his concern . ' \nHowever , all mention of the Iraq connection to extremism was removed from ` core scripts ' - briefing papers given to ministers to defend the government 's position on Iraq and terror . \nThe document begins : ` We do not see the Muslim community as a threat . \nMuslims have always made , and continue to make , a valuable contribution to society . ' \nThe lines to be used by ministers include measures designed to address Muslim concerns , such as the introduction of religious hatred legislation and tackling educational underachievement among Muslims . \nBut there is nothing to address the concerns raised by Jay eight months earlier . \nThe documents reveal deep divisions at the heart of government over home-grown religious extremism and its connections to British intervention in Iraq . \nThe Prime Minister has consistently said that the bombers were motivated not by a sense of injustice but by a ` perverted and poisonous misinterpretation of Islam ' . \nAlthough Iraq was clearly used as a pretext by extremists , he said he believed it was ideology that drove them to kill . \nTo press home the point , Downing Street issued a list of atrocities carried out before intervention in Afghanistan and Iraq . \nThe claim was later undermined by the MI5 , which said that Iraq was the ` dominant issue ' for Islamic extremists in Britain . \nJack Straw , the Foreign Secretary , also rowed back from his comments immediately after the bombings that there was no connection with Iraq and the terror threat after it became clear that the public remained unconvinced . \nBut Jay 's letter shows that the Foreign Office was convinced that foreign policy played a key role in radicalising young Muslims . \nThe letter outlines a list of 11 ` work streams ' to discourage extremism . \nThey included delegations to the Islamic world , ministerial briefings for key members of the Muslim community and receptions to mark key Muslim festivals . \nIt is not known how Turnbull responded to the letter , although it is clear that , by January , there was a significant difference between what was being said within the Foreign Office and what ministers were officially being permitted to say in speeches . \nLiberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten last night called on the government to come clean about the link between extremism among British Muslims and anger about Iraq : ` For the government to deny a link between the war in Iraq and dismay among the Muslim community is ridiculous . \nBut to try to cover it up , when senior civil servants have recognized the seriousness of the resentment , is even worse .

{"id": "14", "time": "2005-05-14", "text": "Suicide bombing is n't as new or alien as westerners imagine Saturday 14 May 2005 00.01 BST One of the most chilling aspects of the Iraqi conflict is that suicide bombings have now become a matter of everyday routine . \nDuring April there were 67 , a new record . \nOn Wednesday there were no less than five separate suicide attacks across Iraq , killing 71 people and injuring scores of people . \nThe rate of suicide bombings - the seemingly endless supply of people prepared to blow themselves up - leaves a western audience utterly bewildered . \nWhat kind of psychology motivates people to such violent extremes ? \nThe incomprehension prompts revulsion that this form of warfare is historically unprecedented and reveals a peculiar , aberrant irrationality - a kind of inhuman madness . \nAll too quickly , Islam is blamed for deluding its believers into martyrdom with promises of 72 virgins ; the old prejudices about Islam as a faith uniquely associated with violence and unquestioning belief are fanned into life again . \nBut such prejudices wo n't get us very far in trying to unpick which elements of this violent phenomenon are in fact unprecedented and which are not - or to understand why the strategy has been adopted . \nThere are two obvious factors . \nFirst , the plentiful supply of volunteers crossing into Iraq reflects the radicalisation of a generation of the newly urbanised , under-employed , fast growing populations of many Muslim countries in the Maghreb and the Middle East . \nSecond , suicide attacks are the single most effective weapon against the vastly superior armed force of the US in their heavily defended camps . \nAlong with more conventional resistance tactics , suicide bombings are helping to cripple Iraqi reconstruction and fuelling resentment of the occupation . \nThis has successfully derailed US hubris in a `` regional redesign '' . \nHow else could all these aims have been achieved ? \nBut even while grasping this , suicide bombings still profoundly outrage western sensibility . \nThere are two separate aspects of the current wave : the use of suicide as a tactic of war ; and the tendency to deploy it recklessly against soft or civilian targets outside the theater of conflict . \nThe latter is a familiar feature of different forms of terrorism - so nothing much new there . \nSuicide attacks also have historical precedent ; but what does seem new , first in Palestine and now in Iraq , has been the combination of the two and their frequency . \nIt is that particular combination of individual motivation to kill oneself and the cold ruthlessness to stand among the people one is going to kill before detonating oneself which is hardest to understand . \nTracing the history of how suicide has been used as a weapon and as a protest through history offers up many illuminating parallels to what might motivate those who undertake the suicide missions in Iraq . \nIt was the Japanese who made the use of suicide as a military strategy so feared , and the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka in the 1980s who applied it as a technique for assassinations . \nBoth were part of wider military efforts which were not always easily distinguishable from a suicide mission . \nThe line in war between a suicidal mission and a reckless disregard for one 's own life can be very blurred . \nThis was true in the Soviet struggle against the Germans in the second world war . \nSome Soviet pilots undertook explicit suicide missions to ram bridges in Germany in 1945 ; many others went into battle knowing they would die , and saw their death as a sacrifice for the `` motherland '' . \nIt is the powerful who determined how such events are understood ; while the Japanese and Islamist militants are feared as inhuman , the Soviets are celebrated for their courageous defiance of nazism . \nThe idea of suicide to serve a set of beliefs is also deeply rooted in history . \nThe staging of the current brilliant production of Julius Caesar in London pointedly refers to Iraq with its US military fatigues and the set of a military warehouse . \nSeveral suicides in the final scenes lead to Brutus 's poignant comment that swords have been turned `` in our own proper entrails '' . \nRoman republicanism , imperial Japanese militarism : both elevated suicide as an honorable part of military valor . \nEven more closely related to Iraq 's suicide bombers is the fascinating description of early Christian martyrdom in Farhad Khosrokhavar 's new book , Suicide Bombers . \nThe suicidal recklessness of a large number of early Christians , aimed precisely at bringing about their martyrdom , bewildered and horrified contemporary commentators . \nBut martyrdom was an astonishingly effective propaganda tool designed to inspire awe - and converts . \nThe Greek origin of the word martyr is `` witness '' . \nInterestingly , it prompted exactly the same sorts of criticism among pagan Romans as today 's Islamist militants do in the west : the Christian martyrs were accused of dementia and irrationality . \nSuch was the flood of Christians in pursuit of martyrdom by the third century that the theologians had to step in to declare this thirst for a holy death to be blasphemous . \nThat concept of using your death to bear witness to a cause , without killing others , has prompted more than 1,000 suicides since 1963 , when a Buddhist monk set himself on fire in protest against the oppression of Buddhism in Vietnam . \nGlobal mass media ensure that this individual protest has impact across the world ; it is a desperate but hugely effective way to give the cause prominence . \nElements of all these precedents can be traced in the research done on motivations of suicide bombers in Palestine , Chechnya and al-Qaida and probably now those in Iraq . \nA sense of humiliation and the need to avenge honor on the part of their faith and\\/or people -LRB- or a potent combination of both as in Iraq -RRB- is emphasised by Khosrokhavar . \nHe also picks up on how hating the world -LRB- because of the experience of injustice and oppression -RRB- leads to a longing for death - a rejection of this world 's vale of tears . \nThese are concepts which are very difficult for westerners living largely comfortable lives to grasp . \nHonour is meaningless to us ; we have replaced it with a preoccupation with status and self-fulfilment . \nWe dimly grasp self-sacrifice but only apply the concept to our raising of children . \nMeanwhile , nothing can trump our dedication to the good life of consumer capitalism , and certainly not any system of abstract beliefs . \nNot having experienced the desperation of oppression , we have little purchase on the extremism it might engender . \nMeanwhile , we have medicalised rather than politicised the condition of hating the world and longing for death . \nThe gulf in understanding yawns wide . \nBut our outraged incomprehension of suicide bombing is also partly because it is the opposite of how we have come to believe wars are fought . \nIt is not the high technology of laser-guided bombs , nor the strangely sterile detachment of the aeroplane camera without any images of the screams , smashed bones and blood . \nThe west can only now kill from a distance - preferably from several thousand feet up in the air or several hundred kilometres away on an aircraft carrier . \nIt is the very proximity of these suicide missions which is so shocking . \nThis kind of intimate killing is a reversion to pre-industrial warfare - the kind of brutality seen in the thirty years war , for example . \nSuicide bombers in Iraq are a new permutation of old traditions ; they have no monopoly on the horrors they reveal of the human psyche and its capacity to destroy life . \n"}

'' \nIt was not always this way . \nIn the 1950s , Iraq was the first Arab country to appoint a female government minister . \nWomen worked freely in banks and government and administrative departments and were involved in a vibrant public debate . \nThe changes came in the 1990s when Saddam Hussein began to appease the tribes and the imams . \nHe allowed men to take four wives and ruled there would no longer be any punishment for a man who killed a woman in his family if he suspected her of an `` honor crime '' . \nThese conservative rulings have been inherited and tacitly endorsed by the major religious parties . \nAt one stage a year ago , hardliners in the US-appointed governing council tried to pass article 137 that would impose Islamic Sharia law over rights of personal status , drastically diluting the legal protection for women . \nAfter a series of vocal protests the article was dropped , but it was a clear warning of the conservative political program that lies ahead . \nThese are the public problems . \nIn private there is so much more that remains unspoken . \nThe conference organiser Mohammad , 44 , runs the Organisation for Women 's Freedom in Iraq , an outspoken campaigning movement . \nShe is rare among Iraqi women : avowedly secular and unafraid to stand up in public and pugnaciously condemn the failings of the male-dominated establishment . \nShe dresses as she might in the west - today she is wearing a smart trouser suit and her long dark hair is , as always , uncovered . \nHer views are so radical in today 's Iraq that she has twice had death threats , always travels with a guard and has a small silver pistol hidden in her purse . \nHer group has already established two women 's shelters - in Baghdad and Kirkuk . \nIn the past year perhaps a dozen women have been taken in and many more have asked for help , telling stories of brutality and oppression rarely acknowledged in public . \nThey found one woman from a strict Islamic family in the Kurdish north who had been raped before she was married . \n`` After her husband found out he decided she was filthy and not allowed to touch her newborn child . \nIt was bad , daily beatings . \nWe found her on the street weeping , '' says Mohammad . \nNow the woman , 23 , is back at school , living in the shelter and planning to go to university . \nThe group 's campaigning and shelters is largely down to the energy of Mohammad herself . \nAn architecture graduate from Baghdad University , she lived abroad for 10 years before the war , mostly in Toronto . \nThere she met socialist feminists and decided to return to Iraq to campaign after the fall of the regime . \nShe sold her house and left her husband and 17-year-old son behind in Canada . \n`` I became obsessed with the shelter . \nIt had to be done , '' she says . \nNow , a year on , she is worried that many people 's frustration at the failures of the occupation are being channeled into hardline Islamic movements . \n`` The liberation should happen through a civil and secular alternative . '' \nShe makes her case in an unrepentant way . \nThe latest copy of her group 's newspaper , al-Musawat , or Equality , shows a photo of her burning a veil . \n`` They should be afraid of us , '' she writes . \nShe refuses to take part in the elections this Sunday , even though rules are in place to ensure that each party includes 25 % women among its candidates . \nShe argues that the overwhelming influence of the Islamists has unfairly tipped the balance and says her group would be unlikely to win a seat . \nInstead she will continue campaigning from outside government . \n`` There are thousands of secular people supporting me . \nWith short , certain steps we will get somewhere , '' she says . \n`` But it will take time .

' \nThe nine cases are in addition to the current court mar tial in Osnabrck , Germany , where three members of the Royal Fusiliers have been accused of abusing Iraqi civilians . \nThe revelation that more of the 9,200 soldiers serving in Iraq could face courts martial has prompted calls from human rights groups for a full public inquiry into the army 's activities . \nThey also want to know when - and to what extent - the government was aware of concerns about the abuse of Iraqis . \nKate Allen , director of Amnesty International UK , which last year raised concerns about the conduct of British troops with defense ministers , said only an independent investigation could reveal the true picture . \nReferring to the court martial in Osnabrck , Allen said : ` What 's really staggering is that these allegations would probably never have come to light had a soldier not taken some pictures into a high street developers ' and the staff not called the police . \nIs that really the full extent of public scrutiny over the behavior of our armed forces ? ' \nAllen said it was not enough for the government to rely on the army 's own inquiries into allegations of mistreatment of Iraqis civilians and soldiers . \n` Complaints against the armed forces are investigated behind closed doors , by the armed forces themselves . \nThe decision whether to pursue a case rests with the commanding officer of the accused - hardly the independent and impartial investigation that international law requires , ' Allen added . \nPhil Shiner , of Birmingham-based Public Interest Lawyers , who is representing Iraqi civilians in some 40 legal actions against the army , 10 of which involve allegations of detention and mistreatment , said he had written to the attorney-general expressing concerns that allegations of abuse might be more widespread than previously acknowledged . \nWhatever the outcome of the army 's investigation into the nine pending investigations , more soldiers will appear before courts martial this year , threatening further negative publicity for defense chiefs who have already seen recruitment levels drop . \nTrooper Kevin Williams , of the 2nd Royal Tank Regiment , will appear before a court martial charged with shooting dead an Iraqi civilian , while Private Alexander Johnston , of the Kings Own Scottish Borderers , is to face trial accused of the unlawful wounding of a 13-year-old boy . \nA number of Territorial Army soldiers who served with the Queen 's Lancashire Regiment are also to face a court martial over charges that they faked photographs of Iraqi soldiers being abused , which were subsequently sold to the Mirror newspaper . \nYesterday it emerged that it was not only British and US forces that are battling abuse charges . \nA female intelligence officer and four military police sergeants from Denmark are to face a court martial accused of mistreating Iraqi prisoners . \nThe abuse is alleged to have occurred last year , when the five were stationed near Basra as part of a 500-strong contingent sent to Iraq . \n"}

{"id": "2", "time": "2005-02-04", "text": "Haunted by his experiences as an army medic in Iraq , David McGough could n't cope with life after his tour of duty . \nYet it took two failed suicide attempts before he was diagnosed as suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder . \nAlison Roberts on the forgotten casualties of the war The first symptom was sleeplessness . \nIt was July 2003 and Lance Corporal David McGough of the Royal Army Medical Corps was just back from a five-month tour of duty in Basra , Iraq . \nLots of the lads from his unit had trouble settling back to a normal routine at first , but most were OK within a fortnight or so . \nDavid , however , did not sleep for an entire month . \n`` My body just would n't switch off , '' he tells me , fidgeting with his hands . \n`` All the time this tension was building , this incredibly tense restlessness . \nI was going for weeks without any sleep at all and then collapsing , sleeping for maybe six hours , and then starting all over again . '' \nAt night , on leave , he walked around his small maisonette in a suburb of Preston , Lancashire , folding and re-folding his clothes , checking and double-checking the locks , looking over his shoulder repeatedly for imagined intruders . \nMcGough was vomiting every day , often bloodily . \nThe odour of cooking or burned meat made him sick , though `` the worst thing is the smell of public toilets '' . \n`` That brings the PoW camps back . \nThe stench of those places was horrendous . '' \nMostly it was the insomnia that started to drive him mad , that made him crash his car and almost beat his then-fiancee , that both masked and exacerbated his chronic underlying depression . \nThe army doctor at the camp in Preston prescribed him Prozac and more or less told him to pull himself together . \nWhen Prozac failed to work , McGough was given a stronger antidepressant , citalopram , `` but no sleeping tablets , and by then - Christmas - I was n't really sleeping at all '' . \nMcGough 's two attempts at suicide , both at Christmas in 2003 , were more cries for help than committed bids to kill himself . \nOn the first occasion he held a knife across his throat until his sister begged him to put it down , and on the second he put a 9mm pistol to his head but did not pull the trigger fully . \nHorrified by what was happening , McGough 's father , a civil servant based in Northern Ireland , called Dr Alun Jones , a civilian psychiatrist who specialises in diagnosing and treating psychological problems in servicemen and women . \n`` It was immediately clear , '' says Jones , `` that McGough was suffering a severe case of post-traumatic stress disorder . '' \nSo far , PTSD experts have seen a mere handful of British sufferers from this latest war in Iraq - but as the violence goes on , the trickle is expected to become a flood . \nLate last year , the independent inquiry into Gulf war illnesses chaired by Lord Lloyd of Berwick came to the conclusion that there was `` every reason '' to accept the existence of a Gulf war syndrome , and that post-traumatic stress was one of several contributing factors . \nThough the Ministry of Defense does not publish statistical predictions , military psychiatrists in America have been warned to expect psychiatric disorder to occur in a remarkable 20 % of servicemen and women returning from Iraq . \n`` What we 've got now is a situation starting to approximate to Northern Ireland or Bosnia , to civil insurrection rather than a straight shooting war , '' says Jones , who runs PTSD clinics around the country and at a residential center in north Wales . \n`` In those kinds of circumstances , where you 're experiencing hatred and violence from an unpredictable civilian population , we tend to get a lot of very disturbed and damaged soldiers . '' \nIn the field of trauma studies , this atmosphere of constant and random danger is known by the shorthand `` no safe place '' . \nOther surveys suggest that roughly half the servicemen who suffer psychiatric illness as a result of traumatic events do not seek medical help , or do so years later , when the psychological afterburn has irreparably damaged marriages , careers and mental wellbeing . \n`` And there 's still a stigma attached , '' says Leigh Skelton , director of clinical services at Combat Stress , the ex-services mental welfare charity . \n`` PTSD is seen as a career-stopper within the army . \nGenerally , the first line of action servicemen and women take is to bottle it up . \nThen they 'll self-medicate , usually with alcohol , sometimes with other substances . \nCries for help often come from relatives rather than from the affected person . '' \nSymptoms range from insomnia , nausea and extreme fatigue to the classic `` flashback '' ; aggression , feelings of alienation and irrational anger . \nSometimes the disorder centres on one particular memory . \nA 30-year-old female ambulance driver in the Territorial Army , for example , constantly replays the moment her vehicle was blown up last year by a hand-made bomb tied to a lamp-post in Basra . \nOne marine in his early 20s now suffering chronic PTSD remembers `` the fear in the eyes of an Iraqi soldier in the window '' of a building mortared by the British ; and seeing that fear again when British soldiers mistakenly opened fire on a civilian vehicle . \nMcGough , however , identified no single trigger . \nSkinny and pale , when I met him in late November he was a shadow of the strong young man he was pre-Iraq - the high-flyer who studied psychology at Queen 's College , Belfast , who loved to sky-dive and socialise , who was promoted within a year of joining the RAMC . \nFor him , the pressure began the moment he and his medical unit moved into Iraq , at 2.30 am on the first night of the war , four hours after the Americans began their aerial bombardment of Baghdad . \nMcGough was 21 years old and effectively in charge of 80 rookie soldiers fresh out of training , most of them still teenagers . \nAs medics , they traveled in canvas-roofed trucks and were not equipped with body armor . \n`` There was gunfire everywhere . \nSome of them were literally crapping themselves in the back of those trucks . '' \nThat first night , there was n't even time to pitch camp . \n`` The worst casualty I saw was an Iraqi guy hit about 13 times , big chunks of his stomach , face and legs just gone . \nWe intubated him and opened him up by the side of a truck . \nYou do it on autopilot at the time because your training kicks in . \nIt 's only afterwards you start to think about what you 've seen and done . '' \nThe mobile field unit , the first line of medical services , was initially established just south of Basra , but was twice relocated to escape attack . \nIts job was to mop up trauma cases , stabilise them and send them to field hospitals nearer the southern border . \nAccording to McGough , the medical unit received up to 1,000 wounded Iraqis during his five-and-a-half-month tour of duty , of whom perhaps 60 % died and were buried in mass graves . \nA large proportion of the medics ' work , however , took place in the PoW camps set up on each site . \n`` Usually we had about 150 prisoners coming in a day , '' says McGough , `` both soldiers and civilians who 'd been picked up with guns . \nSome had clearly been tortured by the Iraqi regime . \nThere was one man who had thick black stuff , like goo , coming out of his penis , and said he 'd been injected with something when he was a prisoner before . \nOthers had quite infected lash wounds on their backs , or broken jaw bones . '' \nThe unit also saw a number of raped women , who were treated and counselled by a female army gynaecologist . \nSeemingly futile or absurd situations are known to compound wartime trauma . \nThe unit 's first location at Basra was regularly attacked by Iraqis defending a nearby ammunition dump from a maze-like system of trenches . \n`` There was no adherence to any kind of convention on their part . \nSometimes it was ridiculous . \nEvery time we hit and wounded someone , a white flag would go up on their side and the others would bring the man we 'd wounded over to the base for treatment . \nThen they 'd go back up and start shooting at us again . '' \nMost harrowing of all was the discovery of the corpse of a 12-year-old girl who 'd been hanged in a backstreet alley in Basra . \nMcGough was sent to confirm the death and recognized her as the child to whom he and his comrades had chatted the week before . \n`` We heard later that she was probably hanged by the crowd because she 'd been talking to our crew ... That was one of the worst things . \nYou expect to see some nasty stuff , but seeing a little girl hanging in the street because she once spoke to you ... '' PTSD has been a recognized injury of war for more than 30 years , yet treatment in Britain is still very patchy . \nIt took complete break-down -LRB- `` my girlfriend found me one night huddled on the floor , shaking and crying '' -RRB- and several emergency trips to hospital in Preston before McGough was finally prescribed sleeping tablets . \nWhile a member of the British army , he was unable to access the civilian care system - and had been informed of a decision to discharge him without a pension . \n`` The army is not a branch of the social services , '' says Jones , `` but I do think there is a certain duty of care , knowing what we now know about the effects of trauma . \nIt would be reasonable to expect the army to check these lads over for psychological injury when they come back from combat , but in fact there is no obligation whatsoever to do this . '' \n`` No one rings or visits in the mornings because I 'm just a horrible , nasty person before the drugs have kicked in , '' says McGough . \nHe was increasingly convinced that his physical symptoms - the vomiting and chronic weight loss - are related to anthrax injections and to the Naps tablets taken to counter the potential use of enemy nerve agents . \nOn bad days he does not get out of bed at all . \n`` I loved being in the army , '' he says . \n`` It was supposed to be my long-term career , and I was prepared to give everything to it ... I just wish I could shake this and get on with my life again . '' \n"}
{"id": "160", "time": "2005-02-04", "text": "How the right played the fascism card against Islam Friday 4 February 2005 00.03 GMT Fascism is coming back into fashion , at least in the propaganda wars . \nFor the right , it comes in the shape of a new word : `` islamofascism '' . \nThat conflates all the elements into one image : suicide bombs , kidnappings and the Qur ` an ; the fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan ; Iranian clerics and Hitler . \nThe term seems to have appeared first in the Washington Times in a reference to Islamist fundamentalists . \nCoined by Khalid Duran , a Muslim scholar seeking to explain Islam to Jews , the word was meant as a criticism of hyper-traditionalist clerics - who in turn denounced Duran as a traitor to the faith . \nUsage has gathered momentum among commentators and academics who seek a verbal missile to debilitate those who disagree with them . \nThey have adopted it as a sort of Judeo-Christian war cry - look for it soon in the title of a neo-conservative think tank conference . \nFor the left , the term `` fascist '' lost its power in the 1970s , when it was sprayed on every authority figure in sight , from the Nixon-Kissinger White House to university provosts to the neighborhood cop . \nTo make Bush-Hitler comparisons work requires more nuanced historical references - to the night of the long knives , for example , as Sidney Blumenthal did about the dismissal of Colin Powell . \nUnfortunately for liberals , those references do n't work as efficiently as islamofascism does for the right , because to imagine the appropriately creepy picture requires a familiarity with German history of the 1920s and 30s . \nNazism is better known for its death camps than for Leni Riefenstahl or the Reichstag fire , so analogies between the Nazis ' early years and current Republican party behavior seem hollow , no matter how strong some parallels might be . \nChristopher Hitchens , a former socialist who now sits on the other end of the political see-saw , sprinkles islamofascism about like paprika . \nHe and Andrew Sullivan , a voice of the right , both wrongly receive credit in some quarters for coining the term . \nLong before September 11 2001 , Duran was commissioned by the American Jewish Committee to produce one side of an interfaith project . \nDuran responded to attacks on his book , Children of Abraham , by deriding those who sought `` to impose religious orthodoxy on the state and the citizenry '' . \nIn that sense , he said , extreme islamism is `` islamofascism . '' \nIt took a couple of years for the word to seep into frequent usage . \nBy then its meaning had expanded . \nLast year , Sullivan cited `` five elements that make it particularly dangerous '' , including the `` broken , medieval societies '' that foster it , the `` unquenchable extremism '' of its motivation , and `` the destructive technology '' its adherents seek . \nUse of the term to describe Muslim clerics and stateless terrorists has neatly pre-empted any chance of labeling Bush a fascist - no matter how many suspects are kidnapped by the US authorities and tortured ; no matter how impervious the border ; no matter how effective the use of propaganda to destroy the opposition ; no matter how many countries are invaded on false pretenses ; no matter how strongly a minority religion may become a mark of guilt . \nLike a MacBook Pro '' says @Mister_Solomon : Westminster Dog Show - live ! \n"}

'' \nTim Schadla Hall , reader in public archaeology at the Institute of Archaeology at University College London , said : `` In this case we see an international conflict in which the US has failed to take into account the requirements of the Hague convention ... to protect major archaeological sites - just another convention it seems happy to ignore . '' \nLieutenant Colonel Steven Boylan , a US military spokes man in Baghdad , said engineering works at the camp were discussed with the head of the Babylon museum . \n`` An archaeologist examined every construction initiative for its impact on historical ruins . '' \nHe said plans were being considered to move some of the units in order `` to better preserve the Babylon ruins . '' \n`` The significance of Babylon is not lost on the coalition , '' he added . \n`` The site dates back to the time of Nebuchadnezzar 's Babylon , but there are very few visible original remains to the untrained eye .

'' At one point , outside the base entrance nicknamed the `` Reno Gate '' , he found a 200-metre stretch of road , lined with the mesh baskets `` that have clearly been filled with deposits from the Babylon site , containing sherds , bones , etc. '' Two areas of 6th century BC brick pavement , part of the processional street , are exposed in this area . \n`` In both cases the bricks are badly broken . \nThis is thought to be the result of a heavy vehicle or vehicles driving over them . \nIf this is so , it is likely that the bricks still covered by earth are similarly damaged . '' \nTrenches have been dug into the ziggurat , one of the stepped pyramids which were one of the most distinctive Babylonian monuments and gave rise to the legend of the Tower of Babel . \n`` Much pottery and many fragments of brick with cuneiform inscriptions of Nebuchadnezzar were observed in the bank of spoil '' next to the trench . \nOther observations include : an old car park vastly expanded to make a helicopter landing zone and parking lot , all flattened and gravelled , old tracks covered in new stones , now deeply rutted from heavy vehicles , large areas scooped out to a depth of two metres to obtain material to fill the sand bags and metal baskets and earth mounded up to protect six fuel depots , which also show evidence of leakage . \nThe most serious damage may be invisible , the contamination and disturbance of areas which have never been excavated , which may mean that many of the secrets of Babylon , including the site of the hanging gardens , may never be resolved . \nIn his conclusions Dr Curtis says : `` A full-scale international investigation should be launched into the damage done to the archaeological site of Babylon during its occupation by coalition forces . '' \nAll mines and ordnance must be cleared , and all disturbed areas investigated and recorded by archaeologists appointed by the Iraqis , he says . \nBabylon has never been on the Unesco list of world heritage sites . \n`` Now more than ever Babylon needs the care , attention and advice that being a world heritage site would ensure it received , '' he says . \nDr Curtis said it was not possible for him to determine at which time , and by which forces , damage was caused : a separate report has been compiled by Polish archaeologists . \nA further report is being compiled by the Iraqis on the damage to Saddam Hussein 's palace , built in a corner of the site , and which had already been looted before allied forces began camping out in the shell . \nThe site had such symbolic importance to Saddam that he rebuilt many of the walls and gates , using bricks stamped with his name , many of which have been stolen . \nDr Curtis , back in his office in the British Museum , refused to say who should pay for the damage , but said : `` The Iraqis simply do not have the resources to tackle the scale of this site , an international effort will clearly be needed .

and he finally makes a Faustian bargain to save the life of a loved one . \nThere was an element of suspense in the earlier Star Wars films . \nWe wondered where Darth Vader came from and what was his relationship to young Luke Skywalker . \nThat has long since gone , being wholly dispelled by the prequels . \nSpecial effects have greatly advanced since 1978 , but technology needs imagination after it has made an initial impression . \nImagination is not the strong suit of Revenge of the Sith . \nThis new century has brought us the Lord of the Rings trilogy , which has a dramatic drive and an emotional sweep that some feel border on the spiritual . \nPeter Jackson 's films overshadow Lucas 's new picture and its ersatz mythology . \nStar Wars III aims to raise serious moral issues but never transcends the banality of evil . \nIts dialogue , combining the pretentious and the flat-footed , expresses the banality of drivel . \nIndifferently directed , the performers can do little with the material . \nThe exception is Ian McDiarmid as the evil Palpatine who shows Anakin how to scowl from under his cowl and become one of the boys in the hood . \nAll this compares rather poorly with Lucas 's other series , the Indiana Jones trilogy , featuring a key figure of the earlier Star Wars pictures , Harrison Ford . \nIn what is also a nostalgic entertainment modelled on Saturday morning serials , Jones confronts - at least in two of his outings - genuine forces of evil , Hitler and the Nazis . \nIn Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade , Indie , like Anakin Skywalker , has to make a life-and-death decision . \nIn order to save his father 's life , he must help the evil powers obtain the Holy Grail , but unlike Anakin he knows how to play a canny game . \nAlthough Lucas appointed others to make a TV series about the young Indiana Jones , he restricted himself in the cinema to a short prequel segment about the teenage Indie , explaining his troubled relations with his father and how he came to be the way he was . \nIt is a witty , sparkling 15-minute sequence tucked into the opening of The Last Crusade , not three solemn movies made over a period of five years . \n"}

3000 BC -RRB- . \nLater Amman became the capital of the Ammonites , a semitic people frequently mentioned in the Bible , and was known as Ammon . \nEgypt 's King Ptolemy II Philadelphus conquered the city in the third century BC and renamed it Philadelphia after himself ; the name was retained through Byzantine and Roman times . \nAt the rise of Islam , the city 's name returned to its semitic origin of Ammon or Amman , after being taken by the Arab general Yazid ibn Abu Sufyan in AD 635 . \nBy about 1300 the city had entirely disappeared for unknown causes . \nIn 1878 the Ottoman Turks resettled the site with Circassian refugees from Russia ; it remained a small village until after the first world war . \nTransjordan became part of the Palestine mandate , but Britain severed it from western Palestine -LRB- 1921 -RRB- and established a protected emirate of Transjordan , under the rule of Abdullah bin al-Hussein . \nAmman became capital of this new country ; the city 's growth was accelerated at Jordan 's independence -LRB- 1946 -RRB- . \nThe city is a thriving metropolis with a population of more than 1 million people . \nIts growth has been driven largely by political events in the region , especially the Arab-Israeli conflict which has drawn waves of Palestinian refugees to the city . \n"}
{"id": "60", "time": "2005-11-12", "text": "What is it good for ? \nGeneral Sir Rupert Smith 's The Utility of Force and Martin Shaw 's The New Western Way of War show how western leaders fail to grasp the nature of modern warfare , says Martin Woollacott It seems tautologous to say that there is something wrong with war . \nMorally wrong , of course , but also wrong in the sense that the function of this dangerous , expensive and ethically dubious institution has become increasingly unclear in the past half century . \nWars have , on the whole , ceased to deliver the clear resolutions of human conflicts which , for all their costs , they once did . \nNow we still have the costs , but not so often the resolutions . \nThis is true of all societies , but western countries have a particularly tortuous recent record of largely unsuccessful warfare . \nWhen western armies lose , does n't that mean that others win , and therefore that war is still useful to them ? \nNot necessarily , because a frequent outcome is that the conflict continues , even though the war ends . \nAbout the only thing that is clear in the muddled landscape of historical relics , irrelevantly advanced technology , nuclear pretence , old symbols and new threats is that war still kills people . \nThat is why it is so important to try to understand what is going on . \nThese books - one by a soldier trying to wrest some continuing purpose for his profession and one by an academic who believes that the west 's attempts to reshape the military instrument have failed - are both very worthwhile efforts to map difficult ground . \nThough they come to somewhat different conclusions , some arguments and categorisations are strikingly similar . \nSoldier and sociologist are looking at the same scene , as indeed many others have done , most notably the Israeli military thinker Martin van Creveld , whose On Future War opened up many of these themes more than a decade ago . \n`` War no longer exists , '' Rupert Smith proclaims in his very first sentence , by which he means that the industrialised clash of mass armies inaugurated by Napoleon , which culminated in the two world wars , will never happen again . \nWhat will also not happen , obviously , is the city-smashing fight we supposedly prepared for during the nuclear confrontation between the west and the Soviet Union , although `` lesser '' nuclear exchanges between new nuclear powers are unfortunately still a possibility . \nSmith makes these points so strongly because he believes that political and military leaders and their publics , in the west , are still wedded to the structures and expectations of industrialised war . \nThey are wedded to the assumptions - but also increasingly unable to provide the men , the motivation and the industrial muscle that once went with them . \nIn the range of conflicts the world has actually experienced over the past half century , and particularly since the end of the cold war , armies of this kind have often not done well and governments with these expectations have usually been disappointed . \nIn the confusion of both purposes and means , it is not surprising that soldiers have found it hard to land a telling military blow . \nSmith , for instance , was the only UN commander in Bosnia ever able to do so . \nHe did so by quietly building up his forces , by discreetly circumventing the intentions of most of the governments whose troops and guns he commanded , by analyzing the capacities and character of his opponent , the Serb general Ratko Mladic , and by successfully deceiving him . \nThe artillery and air strikes he organised in 1995 on Serb forces around Sarajevo , followed up by ground forces , broke the siege of the Bosnian capital . \nThey helped to push the Bosnian Serbs on to the defensive and led on to the Dayton settlement , although Smith is honest enough to say that concurrent Croatian and Bosnian advances were the primary cause of the shift . \nBosnia was a case where the intervening powers literally had no strategy , and in this limbo Smith had to craft the framework for action that his political masters so signally failed to provide . \nIn other circumstances the political will is there and it is all too easy to land the telling military blow , as in Iraq in 2003 , but the resulting military victory does not bring a political resolution . \nAs Smith says , an inadequate overall strategy is as bad as or worse than no strategy at all and is most likely to produce the paradoxical combination of military success and political failure , as shown , at least so far , in places like Iraq and Chechnya . \nSmith calls the new kind of conflicts `` war among the people '' . \nThey are fights , he says , which , even if successful from the western point of view , usually provide only a step towards the desired end , rather than delivering it at once by military means . \nThey are fights taking place among the people , both in the combat arena and in the world at large . \n-LRB- This is one reason why the media are even more important than in previous conflicts . -RRB- \nThey are fights that are often episodes of violence in a long process of confrontation rather than definitive struggles . \nThey are fights where the conventional side , especially if it is western rather than , say , Russian , Indian or Chinese , tries hard to keep both its own casualties and its equipment losses to an absolute minimum . \nThey are fights involving the constant adaptation and reshuffling of weapons and tactics designed for other purposes . \nAnd they are fights in which the sides are rarely single states , but rather multinational coalitions and sub-state parties and movements . \nThere are striking similarities between some of Smith 's and Shaw 's principles . \nSmith 's `` among the people '' is close to Shaw 's idea of `` global surveillance war '' , in which a conflict is fought under the critical gaze not only of the people among whom it is being waged and the people in intervening nations but of the world as a whole . \nAbove all , Smith 's emphasis on force protection chimes with Shaw 's central concept of `` risk-transfer war '' . \nBut where Smith sees this as simply a logical consequence of the value and scarcity of military assets in western societies , Shaw goes beyond that to identify what he regards as the key problem at the heart of the way recent conflicts have been conducted by western countries . \nIn the aftermath of Vietnam , Shaw believes , the west came up with a formula for making war that was felt to be both sustainable at home and likely to be effective . \nIt used technical superiority and , in particular , air power , to destroy enemy combatants without incurring serious casualties . \nIndeed , it privileged its own military personnel to the point of a readiness to inflict `` collateral '' damage on civilians that could otherwise have been avoided . \nIt used new ways of controlling the media , including embedding reporters , to dominate the `` narrative '' of wars , so as to build support at home and suppress the views of opponents . \nIn this way , risks have been transferred from politicians to their soldiers , then on to enemy soldiers and finally to non-combatants . \nThese were wars with varied purposes , but many liberals were attracted to the idea that the military could be used to stop conflicts and to discipline or even unseat oppressive regimes . \nKosovo was the acme of such wars , with not a single allied soldier lost . \nThe Falklands , much earlier , was close . \nThe two Gulf wars seemed to fit the template - but not if you saw them as one conflict and counted the civilian losses not only of the two periods of combat but of the sanction years and of the occupation , a still mounting total . \nShaw 's conclusion is that even when such wars `` work '' , they are still degenerate . \nWhen they do not , the degeneracy is compounded , and when terrorists strike in western capitals it is clear they have understood the vulnerabilities the new way of war was intended to protect as well as their opponents have . \nShaw concludes by calling for the strenuous avoidance of war , even if the use of force is sometimes unavoidable . \nSmith concludes by calling for force to be used only when it is fitted into more realistic and more responsible political strategies . \nIn the end , there is not much in it . \nThere are no magic , painless wars , and we are at a point , both agree , for reassessment and reflection . \nTo order The Utility of Force for # 23 or The New Western Way of War for # 12.99 , both with free UK p & p , call Guardian book service on 08708360875 . \nWrite your review of this or any other book , find out what other readers thought or add it to your lists Letters for publication should be sent to : letters@guardian.co.uk If you need help using the site : userhelp@guardian.co.uk Call the main Guardian and Observer switchboard : Review : The Utility of Force and The New Western Way of War This article appeared on p8 of the Guardian review section of the Guardian on 15.26 GMT on Saturday 12 November 2005 . \n"}

\nBlair committed Britain and British soldiers to the American side in Iraq because he believed that it would be perilous for us , indeed for all America 's allies , to leave our friend to fight alone . \nWithout Britain could America have invaded ? \nIt probably would have done so , but the enterprise would have been more politically hazardous and it is possible that British hesitation would have encouraged doubts in the American establishment . \nChoking off our own grave doubts , the sort that the foreign secretary , Jack Straw , evidently put to Blair at the eleventh hour , did Washington no favors . \nIs it really the role of a good friend to suppress real anxieties rather than express them candidly ? \nSupporting the Bush invasion of Iraq is probably the worst service we have paid America . \nSo what influence did we buy for ourselves by going along with this ill-judged adventure ? \nFrom the Crawford meeting in the spring of 2002 , Blair had given Bush and his senior advisers to understand that , whatever happened , if there was fighting we would be shoulder to shoulder with them . \nWhat influence did we ever exercise over substance as opposed to process - over the prosecution of the war or the government of Iraq when the war was formally over , with the `` mission accomplished '' but the fatalities about to mount ? \nIt is revealing that whatever the disastrous mistakes made by the occupying power in Iraq - the purging of Ba'athists , the employment of the sort of military overkill tactics used by the Israeli Defense Forces , the Grozny-isation of Falluja and other towns - no one has pointed the finger of blame at the British . \nNo one holds Britain to account because no one thinks for a nanosecond that Britain is implicated in the decisions . \nBritain is there as part of the feudal host , not as a serious decision-sharing partner . \nWe have been assured that we have been influential in persuading Bush and his colleagues to become more involved in pushing forward the peace process in the Middle East . \nConceivably , one day this will be true . \nBut in the years when I saw close-up the process deliberately driven into a layby , Britain 's principal role was to find excuses for American inaction , not reasons for prodding Washington into doing something . \nBlair is right to argue , as others do , that the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648 no longer provides an adequate basis for international law . \nThat treaty , which brought to an end the Thirty Years war and inaugurated the modern European state system , also concluded that one state should only take up arms against another and intervene in its affairs if it were itself to be attacked by that state . \nThat is plainly no longer sufficient as a central assumption in international law . \nBlair feels strongly that there should be an international consensus , rooted in the practices and principles of the UN , which can legitimise armed intervention in cases such as Rwanda , Kosovo and Afghanistan , where other efforts to prevent a crisis fail . \nHis views on intervention were set out in a speech in Chicago in 1999 where he laid out five main considerations that could justify our intervention to prevent `` threats to international peace and security '' . \nWere we sure of our case ? \nHad we exhausted all diplomatic options ? \nWere there military options that would be undertaken prudently ? \nWere we prepared to stick things out for the long term ? \nWere our national interests involved ? \nDid Blair think that these tests were met in the case of Iraq ? \nThe problem about going to war in a democracy on the sort of grounds to which the Blair doctrine refers , the attempt to pre-empt danger , is that it depends crucially on trust . \nHas Iraq made it more or less likely that when the pre-emptive use of force is required in future , voters in Britain and other democracies will support it ? \nDo voters feel they were told the truth about Iraq ? \nWere they told the truth ? \nHave the invasion and occupation increased the dangers of terrorist attack on free and independent states ? \nOne of the principal concerns about Blair 's policy on Iraq is that it makes it more difficult to put in place a policy of pre-emptive intervention with the backing of international law and of public opinion in democratic societies . \nBlair is clearly committed to Britain playing a strong role in Europe . \nHe has worked hard with France to develop a more effective European defense capability , which has fluttered the dovecotes in Washington . \nWhile Americans want Europe to do more for itself in the field of security , they are reluctant to see the development of capacity leading to any decoupling from a chain of command that they control themselves . \nBlair is right to worry that at the moment Europe dwells in the worst of all worlds : our pretensions worry the Americans without giving us much additional ability to work with them to make the world safer . \nUnfortunately , Blair 's European ambitions have been thwarted in Iraq . \nMaybe he could have been more effective in bridging the Atlantic - representing Europe to America and America to Europe . \nBut it would have taken a clearer and more outspoken determination to speak up for European doubts from time to time . \nDid Blair ever speak out against American attacks on `` the cheese-eating surrender monkeys of Europe '' ? \nDid he try to explain the strength of public opinion in Europe - far more united in hostility to the Iraq adventure than governments ever were ? \nEven members of his own party clearly doubt whether the British engagement in Iraq would have developed in the same way without him . \nWould a Brown-led government - whatever Brown would have said loyally on the hustings in 2005 - have gone to war for the same reasons ? \nNow we must hope and work for a peaceful democratic future for Iraq . \nWe can at least support Blair in that . \nBut we can not forget the journey that brought us here . \nA victim of his own interpretation of the `` special relationship '' , Blair is all too likely to be judged by history as a leader who was braver in defending Bush 's agenda in Iraq than he was in standing up for his own , and Britain 's , strategic objectives in Europe . \nThis is an edited extract from Not Quite the Diplomat by Chris Patten , published by Penguin , # 20 . \nTo order a copy for # 18 with free UK p & p go to guardian . \n"}
{"id": "280", "time": "2005-09-19", "text": "When Doonesbury was dropped from G2 , hundreds of enraged fans were quick to point out our mistake . \nTo celebrate its return , lifelong fan Linda Grant explains what the fuss is about , and talks to its creator Garry Trudeau ` It would be a disservice to Mr Mitchell and his character to prejudge the man , but everything known to date could lead one to conclude he 's guilty . \nGuilty , guilty , guilty !! '' If , whenever you sniff out a lying politician or crook with a good lawyer , you want to look him in the eye and shout : `` Guilty , guilty , guilty ! '' \n, you are , whether you know it or not , uttering the words of that great student revolutionary and radical radio jock Mark Slackmeyer , speaking in this instance of the Watergate conspirator John Mitchell , in 1973 . \nAnd guilty , guilty , guilty is the indictment of the dolt who thought that it would n't matter if the Guardian , after 25 years of Doonesbury , the comic strip in which Slackmeyer appeared , decided to drop it . \nWhy does Doonesbury matter ? \nOK , here 's why . \nIt 's all one big 35-year story , starting with the cartoon 's inception in 1970 , with the lives of the eponymous Mike Doonesbury , Mark Slackmeyer and Zonker Harris , from their layabout days on Walden Pond , the student commune in New England , to the baby-boomer middle age we are all stunned to have found ourselves reaching . \nI first came across the strip when I was hitchhiking across the US a year after the Nixon resignation , a 2lb copy of Pynchon 's Gravity 's Rainbow weighing down my backpack . \nI was in America because , well , wow ! \nNo one I knew back then was anti-American ; out of the response to the Vietnam war had come the counter-culture . \nAmerica was the country of Gloria Steinem and Ms Magazine , of the Black Panthers and the Chicago Seven , Jane Fonda astride a tank in Hanoi , Vermont communes , hash brownies -LRB- whatever brownies were -RRB- , group marriage , Cheech and Chong . \nYou could not turn your back on America if you were at all interested in your own generation and its future . \nI crossed the border into Canada to look up an old boyfriend , a graduate student at the University of Manitoba . \n`` Here , look at this , '' he said , showing me the local newspaper . \nIt was a comic strip which did n't just satirise but editorialised , sustaining a day-by-day argument against the government and its domestic and foreign policy , told in narrative form . \nBut what jumped out at you about Doonesbury was that it was a comic strip about us . \nWe were those student layabouts , and there in the little boxes were our political discussions , our lives , our values . \nThe character who most engaged my attention then was Joanie Caucus , the escapee wife and new feminist who tried to bring women 's liberation to the stoned guys in the Walden Pond commune . \nJoanie was a cartoon character with baggage : an ex-husband who would rather go bowling than talk to her , a daughter she was trying to bring up as a free woman . \nAnd she embodied feminism 's dichotomy ; the desire for freedom and the desire for a relationship . \nWe followed the Walden Ponders trying to fix her up with the Rev , the self-styled `` fighting priest who can really talk to the young '' , who had n't had a date since before the Selma march -LRB- `` I 've been busy '' -RRB- , then with Andy Lippincott , perhaps the first ever cartoon character to come out of the closet , mid-frame . \nBut the strip 's ambitions ranged beyond the living room at Walden Pond . \nJoanie went to law school at Berkeley . \nShe got a job working for a woman senator and married Rick Redfern , the investigative reporter . \nJoanie took us to Washington and the strip took us to Vietnam itself , to meet Phred the Vietcong fighter , later bringing him back to America to testify at a Senate sub-committee on the fate of Cambodian refugees , feted at the kind of radical-chic dinners that Tom Wolfe might have satirised -LRB- `` Can I have your roll ? '' -RRB- . \nThe 70s turned into the 80s , into Reagan 's America , and still no one at Walden had graduated . \nWe knew Doonesbury was stuck in a timewarp , but it was still a shock when Trudeau took a year off to re-think his characters ' lives . \nHis brilliance was to decide to confront us with the choices we were making in our own lives , to turn a political satire into a social one , a critique of what the baby-boom generation was making of its own adulthood . \nJoanie 's boss got Alzheimer 's . \nMark was the second character to come out as gay and confounded us with sex 's reckless , ruthless political incorrectness , falling in love with a Republican . \nMeanwhile , Mike went to work in advertising and had to represent the tobacco industry : enter a new character , Buttsy , a talking cigarette . \nMike moved out to Seattle at the time of the dotcom boom to launch the software for a search engine and got eaten alive by Microsoft . \nHis wife JJ , Joanie 's daughter , ran off to find herself as a performance artist . \nWhen the strip returned to Vietnam , Phred was running a resort hotel and acting as a consultant for Nike . \nWe went on reading Doonesbury , not just because of the politics , which were as sharp as ever with Reagan in the Oval Office , but because it was the lifelong soap opera of ourselves . \nYou could dismiss it as the Archers for ageing hippies , but Trudeau is smart enough to continually update not only the politics , but the characters , introducing the next generation : Joanie and Rick 's son , Alex , now at Walden College , has shamed his parents by joining the CIA as a summer intern , and managing to accidentally launch a Hellfire missile from a Predator drone , taking out an al-Qaida ammo dump . \nMike 's second wife , Kim Rosenthal , the orphaned Vietnamese-Jewish-Southern-Californian American , entered the strip as a Generation X hacker . \nTrudeau seems to understand contemporary America from top to bottom , from President King , the administrative head of Walden College who is engaged in a losing fight against grade inflation , down to Elmont , a mover and shaker in the Washington , DC homeless community who blew a fortune in day trading . \nAnd if the strip is always making us laugh and making us angry , it also has the power to move us on many levels . \nThe sun coming out over the White House as the Vietnam war ends . \nAndy Lippincott dying of Aids , passing over into death listening to the Beach Boys ' Pet Sounds . \nAnd this year , the shock of perennial football player and resident Republican BD going to Iraq with his National Guard unit and losing his leg . \nA comic strip that deals with denial , depression , post-operative therapy ? \nBut that 's Doonesbury - it just keeps on taking risks with the format . \nThere were times , of course , when for a British audience it became incomprehensible as it tackled domestic questions . \nI would ring an American friend to get a briefing on the US constitution , or just stop reading for a week or so , checking in each day to see if he had moved on to something I could once again understand . \nBut the strip , which had started out of my fascination with America , has remained the place where you can still understand what America is up to , an invaluable adjunct to its over-reverent journalism . \nAs an American friend and long-term reader of the strip told me , and perhaps he was only half-joking : `` The only coverage I read of the Iraq war was in Doonesbury . '' \nSince 1970 , Garry Trudeau has rarely given interviews to the press . \nOn Thursday night , Trudeau and I had an email exchange . \nFor me , the most fascinating aspect of the cartoon was its narrative character , as if it were a serialised 19th-century novel . \nSo when Trudeau took that year off , to reinvent his characters , had he had a long-term plan for each of them ? \n`` No , it was more a matter of setting them on individual paths out into the real world , '' he replied . \n`` When the strip returned , all the characters had moved forward in real time - back stories included graduation , a wedding , new jobs etc - but there was no plan beyond the new setups . \nI 've always thought of the strip as more journal than novel . \nIt 's true that comics often use novelistic conventions - such as routinely tossing the characters into a great thicket of Dickensian coincidence - but mostly Doonesbury is put together on the fly , as running dispatches , so fleetingly observed that I ca n't even remember writing whole sequences . '' \nWas he pissed off at the Guardian 's decision to erase him ? \n`` Are you allowed to say ` piss off ' in British newspapers ? \nWriting for the Guardian must be fun . \nI 've certainly enjoyed appearing there . \nIf memory serves , the paper signed up for Doonesbury nearly 25 years ago , just before I took a long sabbatical from the strip . \nWe withdrew the feature from all 600 or so client papers , save one - the Guardian . \nWe had been so delighted by the placement - and were so concerned that , once left in the lurch , the paper would never come back - that we decided to provide the Guardian with repeat episodes -LRB- it helped that we had 10 years ' worth of strips in the archives that the British public had n't seen -RRB- . \nAs to the recent cancellation , I knew nothing of the decision prior to the strip being reinstated , so there was no opportunity to work myself up into a righteous snit , which was a disappointment . '' \nDoonesbury must seem to many Americans the only place in the country where dissent is still possible , and where its presidents are routinely exposed and satirised in a way that its supine press has failed to emulate . \nI asked him if he felt that his comic strip was doing a better job than the newspapers they are printed in , in sustaining a climate of political dissent in contemporary America ? \n`` Well , that 's not really for me to judge , '' he replied . \n`` I will say there 's no shortage of dissent in America - it 's just that it 's largely impotent . \nChallenges to the White House narrative continue to be reframed as unpatriotic . \nAnd fear-mongering has disabled civil public discourse . \nBefore the last election , our friends abroad could say the problem was Bush , not the American people . \nPerhaps Doonesbury flatters us . \nIt reminds us of who we once were , of our values . \nI prefer to think that it keeps us honest , because those values do not seem to have abandoned Trudeau himself . \nThe counter-culture sold out , its idealism failed , we had to compromise : with being adults , holding down jobs , being parents . \nWould he go on drawing it to his dying day , or might there be a final strip , a final frame , The End ? \n`` As to when it all ends , '' he said , `` there are so many unforeseeable factors ; health , energy , interest - it 's impossible to know .

{"id": "217", "time": "2005-11-15", "text": "The US used chemical weapons in Iraq - and then lied about it Now we know napalm and phosphorus bombs have been dropped on Iraqis , why have the hawks failed to speak out ? \nDid US troops use chemical weapons in Falluja ? \nThe answer is yes . \nThe proof is not to be found in the documentary broadcast on Italian TV last week , which has generated gigabytes of hype on the internet . \nIt 's a turkey , whose evidence that white phosphorus was fired at Iraqi troops is flimsy and circumstantial . \nBut the bloggers debating it found the smoking gun . \nThe first account they unearthed in a magazine published by the US army . \nIn the March 2005 edition of Field Artillery , officers from the 2nd Infantry 's fire support element boast about their role in the attack on Falluja in November last year : `` White Phosphorous . \nWP proved to be an effective and versatile munition . \nWe used it for screening missions at two breeches and , later in the fight , as a potent psychological weapon against the insurgents in trench lines and spider holes when we could not get effects on them with HE -LRB- high explosive -RRB- . \nWe fired ` shake and bake ' missions at the insurgents , using WP to flush them out and HE to take them out . '' \nThe second , in California 's North County Times , was by a reporter embedded with the marines in the April 2004 siege of Falluja . '' \n` Gun up ! ' \nMillikin yelled ... grabbing a white phosphorus round from a nearby ammo can and holding it over the tube . \nBogert yelled , as Millikin dropped it . \nThe boom kicked dust around the pit as they ran through the drill again and again , sending a mixture of burning white phosphorus and high explosives they call ` shake 'n' bake ' into ... buildings where insurgents have been spotted all week . '' \nWhite phosphorus is not listed in the schedules of the Chemical Weapons Convention . \nIt can be legally used as a flare to illuminate the battlefield , or to produce smoke to hide troop movements from the enemy . \nLike other unlisted substances , it may be deployed for `` Military purposes ... not dependent on the use of the toxic properties of chemicals as a method of warfare '' . \nBut it becomes a chemical weapon as soon as it is used directly against people . \nA chemical weapon can be `` any chemical which through its chemical action on life processes can cause death , temporary incapacitation or permanent harm '' . \nWhite phosphorus is fat-soluble and burns spontaneously on contact with the air . \nAccording to globalsecurity.org : `` The burns usually are multiple , deep , and variable in size . \nThe solid in the eye produces severe injury . \nThe particles continue to burn unless deprived of atmospheric oxygen ... If service members are hit by pieces of white phosphorus , it could burn right down to the bone . '' \nAs it oxidises , it produces smoke composed of phosphorus pentoxide . \nAccording to the standard US industrial safety sheet , the smoke `` releases heat on contact with moisture and will burn mucous surfaces ... Contact ... can cause severe eye burns and permanent damage . '' \nUntil last week , the US state department maintained that US forces used white phosphorus shells `` very sparingly in Fallujah , for illumination purposes '' . \nThey were fired `` to illuminate enemy positions at night , not at enemy fighters '' . \nConfronted with the new evidence , on Thursday it changed its position . \n`` We have learned that some of the information we were provided ... is incorrect . \nWhite phosphorous shells , which produce smoke , were used in Fallujah not for illumination but for screening purposes , ie obscuring troop movements and , according to ... Field Artillery magazine , ` as a potent psychological weapon against the insurgents in trench lines and spider holes ... ' The article states that US forces used white phosphorus rounds to flush out enemy fighters so that they could then be killed with high explosive rounds . '' \nThe US government , in other words , appears to admit that white phosphorus was used in Falluja as a chemical weapon . \nThe invaders have been forced into a similar climbdown over the use of napalm in Iraq . \nIn December 2004 , the Labor MP Alice Mahon asked the British armed forces minister Adam Ingram `` whether napalm or a similar substance has been used by the coalition in Iraq -LRB- a -RRB- during and -LRB- b -RRB- since the war '' . \n`` No napalm , '' the minister replied , `` has been used by coalition forces in Iraq either during the war-fighting phase or since . '' \nThis seemed odd to those who had been paying attention . \nThere were widespread reports that in March 2003 US marines had dropped incendiary bombs around the bridges over the Tigris and the Saddam Canal on the way to Baghdad . \nThe commander of Marine Air Group 11 admitted that `` We napalmed both those approaches '' . \nEmbedded journalists reported that napalm was dropped at Safwan Hill on the border with Kuwait . \nIn August 2003 the Pentagon confirmed that the marines had dropped `` mark 77 firebombs '' . \nThough the substance these contained was not napalm , its function , the Pentagon 's information sheet said , was `` remarkably similar '' . \nWhile napalm is made from petrol and polystyrene , the gel in the mark 77 is made from kerosene and polystyrene . \nI doubt it makes much difference to the people it lands on . \nSo in January this year , the MP Harry Cohen refined Mahon 's question . \nHe asked `` whether mark 77 firebombs have been used by coalition forces '' . \nThe US , the minister replied , has `` confirmed to us that they have not used mark 77 firebombs , which are essentially napalm canisters , in Iraq at any time '' . \nThe US government had lied to him . \nMr Ingram had to retract his statements in a private letter to the MPs in June . \nWe were told that the war with Iraq was necessary for two reasons . \nSaddam Hussein possessed biological and chemical weapons and might one day use them against another nation . \nAnd the Iraqi people needed to be liberated from his oppressive regime , which had , among its other crimes , used chemical weapons to kill them . \nTony Blair , Colin Powell , William Shawcross , David Aaronovitch , Nick Cohen , Ann Clwyd and many others referred , in making their case , to Saddam 's gassing of the Kurds in Halabja in 1988 . \nThey accused those who opposed the war of caring nothing for the welfare of the Iraqis . \nGiven that they care so much , why has none of these hawks spoken out against the use of unconventional weapons by coalition forces ? \nAnn Clwyd , the Labor MP who turned from peace campaigner to chief apologist for an illegal war , is , as far as I can discover , the only one of these armchair warriors to engage with the issue . \nIn May this year , she wrote to the Guardian to assure us that reports that a `` modern form of napalm '' has been used by US forces `` are completely without foundation . \nCoalition forces have not used napalm - either during operations in Falluja , or at any other time '' . \nHow did she know ? \nThe foreign office minister told her . \nBefore the invasion , Clwyd traveled through Iraq to investigate Saddam 's crimes against his people . \nShe told the Commons that what she found moved her to tears . \nAfter the invasion , she took the minister 's word at face value , when a 30-second search on the internet could have told her it was bunkum . \nIt makes you wonder whether she really gave a damn about the people for whom she claimed to be campaigning . \nSaddam , facing a possible death sentence , is accused of mass murder , torture , false imprisonment and the use of chemical weapons . \nHe is certainly guilty on all counts . \nSo , it now seems , are those who overthrew him . \n"}

'' \nIsrael 's military intelligence was already assisting us at Unscom -LRB- the United Nations Special Commission , which ran the UN 's weapons inspections program in Iraq -RRB- by scrutinising the `` take '' from the American U-2 spy-plane flights over Iraq . \nIt had proved an unorthodox but fruitful relationship for Unscom : the Israeli analysts had proved far superior to the CIA 's . \nBut what I was now proposing to the Israelis was a dramatic expansion of this intelligence-sharing . \nI was asking Lieutenant Colonel Ponkovsky and his colleagues to accept tapes from a secret Unscom-British communications eavesdropping operation that we were planning in Baghdad itself . \nThe Israelis would process the data -LRB- ie , break any codes or ciphers the Iraqis might be using , and translate -RRB- , and analyze them to determine if there was anything useful for Unscom 's mandate of disarming Iraq . \nIt was an ambitious , and possibly dangerous , project , but I had the backing of Unscom 's senior executives - its chairman , the Swedish diplomat Rolf Ekus , his American deputy , state department official Charles Duelfer , and Russian arms control expert Nikita Smidovich . \nBy the end of January 1996 , the scheme was falling into place : Ponkovsky told me that his boss , director of military intelligence General Ya'alon , had given authorisation . \nJust one part of the jigsaw puzzle was missing : with Britain providing the intercept team , and Israel doing the analysis , that just left the Americans . \nEarlier that month , Duelfer had handed me a paper from the CIA containing a series of questions about Unscom 's communications intercept plan . \nUntil then , the CIA had been disdainful of Unscom as a tool for intelligence-gathering , but now they were getting interested . \nNot that I knew it at the time , but the hidden agenda was regime change . \nSteve Richter , the head of the CIA 's Near East Division , had decided that the CIA would extend a helping hand - as long as they could exploit Unscom 's work to further its plans for a coup against Saddam Hussein . \nThis newfound enthusiasm for Unscom was only confirmed when the CIA saw how weapons inspectors were increasingly gaining access to some of the most sensitive sites in Iraq , including bases belonging to the Special Republican Guard - Saddam 's personal bodyguard . \nThe CIA coup plan went like this : if Unscom inspections could somehow be used to trigger a crisis , that would create a pretext for a US military attack against the Special Republican Guard , then Saddam 's personal security force could be decapitated . \nThis would clear the way for the plotters , led by Mohammad Abdullah al-Shawani , a former commander of Iraqi Special Forces who had defected to Amman in Jordan and been recruited by the CIA , to make their move . \nBut I had no idea of the CIA 's ulterior motives for offering assistance when , on February 4 1996 , I greeted the British eavesdropping team as they arrived at Washington 's Dulles Airport to receive training and equipment from the CIA . \nThe five intercept operators , led by Gary , a short , fit man in his early 30s , would become known as the `` Special Collection Element '' -LRB- SCE -RRB- . \nThe Brits proved to be fast learners , and I was back in northern Virginia by mid-February , checking up on the preparation of the SCE team before escorting them to Bahrain and on to Baghdad . \nThe Iraqis , meanwhile , were well aware of the potential intelligence value of the access gained by the weapons inspectors . \nThe Iraqi secret service , the Mukhabarat , already maintained a unit dedicated to Unscom . \nThe Mukhabarat 's priority was to get sanctions lifted - Iraq 's number one national security priority . \nIts director had been told by Saddam Hussein himself that Iraq had disarmed , and no longer had any interest in developing any WMD capability . \nBut sanctions could not be lifted until Unscom inspectors reached that conclusion for themselves . \nSo the Mukhabarat 's objective was not to obstruct our work ; quite the reverse , they had an interest in getting the Iraqi experts who were our counterparts to cooperate . \nTheir problem was that these officials were petrified of the Special Security Organisation , run by Saddam 's son Qusay Hussein . \nIf their cooperation with Unscom was seen as compromising the regime 's security , the consequences for the individuals involved would have been brutal . \nBecause they regarded such locations as Special Republican Guard units as off-limits , the Special Security Organisation demanded early warning of any inspection effort targeting presidential security . \nAs a consequence , the Mukhabarat redoubled its efforts to penetrate Unscom - with outstanding success . \nFirst , electronic surveillance of our computers in Baghdad , Bahrain and New York was established . \nThen , with French technical assistance provided via the French economic liaison in Baghdad - whether by rogue element , or with official permission is still unknown - the Mukhabarat broke Unscom 's encryption system , so they could listen in on all `` secure '' phone calls between Baghdad and New York . \nWith their advance knowledge of Unscom 's plans , the Iraqis were able to pre-empt inspections at will . \nBy June 1996 , a new inspection , Unscom 150 , was getting under way . \nThe aim was to shed light on the Iraqi mechanism of concealment - specifically the role of the Special Security Organisation . \nThe paramilitary wing of the CIA was taking an extraordinary interest in Unscom 150 . \nA man I knew as Moe Dobbs , a former American weapons inspector who was in fact a senior officer in the CIA 's covert operations Special Activities Staff -LRB- SAS -RRB- , had assigned three men to provide logistics and communications support for the team . \nIn retrospect this was suspicious , but at the time I was just grateful to get the help we so badly needed . \nSmidovich and I put together an inspection plan , which had us `` squeezing '' Special Republican Guard facilities in the Baghdad area . \nWith Israeli help , I had found the location of every Special Republican Guard unit around the capital . \nStrangely , Dobbs and the SAS objected to one of these targets - a barracks belonging to the 3rd Battalion of the 1st Brigade . \n`` There 's nothing there , '' Dobbs said . \n`` We 've checked it out . '' \nWe dropped it from our list . \nWhile we were busy planning our inspection , the CIA 's Iraq Operations Group had dispatched a special team of agents to its Amman Station to coordinate coup planning with the Iraqi National Accord -LRB- INA -RRB- , a group of Iraqi expatriates led by a former Ba'athist official , Iyad Alawi , whom Richter had brought together with al-Shawani . \nThe White House was under political pressure to be seen to be doing something about Iraq . \nWhen the CIA said they had a plan - the `` Silver Bullet '' coup - to get rid of Saddam Hussein , the White House approved it . \nOf course , there was a political dimension : the upcoming presidential elections in November 1996 . \nTony Lake , the national security adviser to President Clinton , was sensitive to any possibility of an `` October Surprise '' and , in private discussions with CIA director John Deutch -LRB- denied by both Deutch and Lake , but acknowledged by many CIA insiders -RRB- , ordered that the coup be wrapped up by early summer . \nThe only problem was that this coup , supposedly planned in great secrecy , was well known to the Iraqi government . \nMany of the defectors being used by the CIA were actually Mukhabarat double agents . \nThen , through a series of tragic mistakes , the Mukhabarat took control of one of the CIA 's secure satellite communications units used by the INA to communicate with the plotters in Baghdad . \nSo the Mukhabarat learned every detail of the plan - including the fact that the CIA was linking the timing of the coup with the Unscom inspection in early June . \nWhen the Unscom 150 team arrived in Baghdad on June 10 1996 under the watchful , if somewhat hostile , stares of our Iraqi minders , Rolf Ekus and the rest of Unscom were completely unaware of the CIA 's ulterior motive . \nOn the very first day , one team was prevented from inspecting a Special Republican Guard barracks in Abu Ghraib . \nThe following day , another group set out for the headquarters of 1st Brigade , SRG . \nThe Iraqis were having none of that either , and Unscom 150 found itself in a stand-off with automatic-rifle-wielding SRG troopers . \nThe Security Council reacted to Baghdad 's non-cooperation by passing a new resolution , 1060 , which `` deplored '' the denial of access and demanded full cooperation . \nTwo days later , the inspectors were still parked in the sun . \nThe decision to send Ekus to Iraq was , on the surface , curious . \nClearly , had the US still wanted to bomb Iraq , they would have pushed harder for a finding of `` material breach '' . \nThe truth was that this sudden U-turn - renewed American support for diplomacy - was driven by the fact that the CIA coup plot was collapsing around them . \nWhile Unscom 150 was parked out front of the Special Republican Guard facilities , the CIA station in Amman was desperately trying to contact the ringleaders of the coup in Baghdad . \nBut their entire network was silent . \nIt was as if they had disappeared off the face of the earth . \nIn reality , Saddam 's intelligence service had so thoroughly infiltrated the plot that there was n't a single CIA-controlled asset left in Iraq who had not been arrested by the Mukhabarat . \nFor the Iraqi leadership there was a clear case for terminating all contact with Unscom , but the Mukhabarat 's Unscom cell had convinced Tariq Aziz and others , including Saddam , that Unscom was being used and was not a witting player in the coup attempt . \nThe Iraqis knew economic sanctions could not be lifted without a favourable report on compliance from Unscom ; Ekus promised to work hard to this end , but needed help . \nOn June 22 , Ekus and Tariq Aziz signed what became known as the `` Agreement for the Modalities of Sensitive Site Inspections '' , which governed how Unscom would go about inspecting sites belonging to Republican Guard , Special Republican Guard , Special Security Organisation , Mukhabarat and other security institutions . \nEkus had done his job - averting a war , while keeping weapons inspections on track . \nThe ramifications of the collapsed coup had yet to sink in . \nAny remaining hopes within the CIA were quashed when , on June 26 , the Agency 's Amman station allegedly received a transmission from one of their secure satellite phones . \nOn the line was the Mukhabarat , who told astonished CIA agents that the game was up . \nWithin days the CIA team in Amman vanished . \nThe US had witnessed a covert action fiasco of a kind not seen since the Bay of Pigs in 1961 . \nSaddam 's security services had rounded up more than 800 suspected plotters , most of whom were tortured and executed . \nAll traces of the CIA 's involvement in a coup plot against Saddam were eliminated . \nIt was the last time I , or anyone in Unscom , saw Moe Dobbs and his colleagues . \nMeanwhile , I was anxious for an opportunity to put the new agreement to the test . \nOn June 24 , I got it - in the form of a CIA-provided photograph that showed a gathering of vehicles outside a Special Republican Guard site on the southern tip of Saddam International Airport , which I labeled `` Site 1a '' . \nSCE intercepts of Iraqi minder communications showed that , at the time the U-2 photograph was taken , the Iraqis wanted to know where every inspector was - arousing our suspicion of ongoing concealment activity . \nThis made `` 1a '' an ideal candidate for testing the `` sensitive site modalities '' . \nLess than a month later , we formed up outside the Baghdad Monitoring and Verification Centre . \nAt the initial Special Republican Guard checkpoint just on the edge of Saddam International Airport , the two convoys - Iraqi and Unscom - linked up and proceeded down the road . \nWe passed through the next two Special Republican Guard checkpoints without problems . \nBut then , as we closed in on Site 1a , we came to a new checkpoint , and these guards were n't playing around . \nTaking up positions in a horseshoe pattern , they aimed loaded rifles , machine guns and grenade launchers at our convoy . \nSuddenly , a vehicle arrived in front of us , on the other side of the checkpoint . \nTwo officers stepped out , took a quick look at the situation , and barked some orders . \nThe gate was opened and we moved on . \nTo our left was the southern edge of Saddam International Airport , and to our right a lush game park with several different species of gazelle and antelope - Saddam 's personal stock for his kitchen . \nFinally , we reached the compounds of Site 1a . \nAs soon as the inspection began , I understood why the Iraqis were so nervous about our presence here . \nThe eastern compound was , as we thought , affiliated with the Special Republican Guard . \nBut it was n't just any SRG unit - it was Saddam 's personal bodyguard , the Radwaniyah Platoon , 2nd Company of the 1st Battalion . \nThis unit was equipped with shiny silver Mercedes sedans , parked in a line under a covered lot . \nTwo of the cars had tarpaulins over them , which , when pulled back , showed the effects of an earlier ambush . \nOne had been riddled with machine-gun bullets , shattering the bullet-proof windows and penetrating the armored doors . \nThe occupants of the second car had gone through an even more terrifying experience : it had obviously been struck by a rocket-propelled grenade . \nOtherwise , it was a standard military barracks , but a search of files turned up something that caught my attention : an emergency administrative notice , declaring that the 3rd Battalion -LRB- Special Forces -RRB- , Special Republican Guard , was `` liquidated '' , and all its members were placed on administrative leave pending further notice . \nThe 3rd Battalion had been the unit singled out by Dobbs and the CIA as being off-limits for inspection during Unscom 150 . \nI now realized what this meant : `` Stay away , those are our guys . '' \nReading of their fate , I felt sick to my stomach . \nOn my way home through London , I again took advantage of a layover at Heathrow to pay a visit to the Defense Intelligence Staff , which had provided Gary and his colleagues for Unscom 's Special Collection Element in Baghdad . \nI was unshaven and dressed in jeans , with the desert dust of Iraq still in the crevices of my hiking boots . \nI looked very rough , but this was just a social visit , a chance to get a quick bite to eat with friends . \nOr so I thought . \nThe door to the director 's office opened , and the director himself walked out , a tall man with a broad smile and firm handshake . \n`` Please join us , will you ? \nWe have something we want you to read and comment on . '' \nInside the folder I was handed was a lengthy report , classified top secret , and containing several US codewords I was familiar with . \nThe subject line read : `` UN COMMUNICATIONS INTERCEPT OPERATION UP AND RUNNING IN BAGHDAD . '' \nI glanced down at the list of addressees . \nThis document had been sent around the world , to every embassy and military headquarters the US maintained . \nThis was more than just giving people a heads-up about our SCE operation . \nThis was blowing its cover to smithereens . \n`` The Yanks seemed to have sent it everywhere except Tariq Aziz 's own office , '' remarked a Ministry of Defense official . \nVery few people in London knew about the operation . \nAnd now all the details , including the real names of the personnel involved , had been broadcast around the world . \n`` We would like your opinion on this matter , '' said the director . \nI did n't hesitate . \n`` Clearly we have to take the best interests of the SCE team itself first . \nThis report represents a compromise of their security , which is unacceptable . \nFrom an Unscom point of view , we must cease the SCE operation immediately . '' \nWhether done on purpose or accident , the American publication of the sensitive details of a covert British intelligence operation , operating under Unscom cover , was an incomprehensible act . \nThe US had killed the SCE , so now we had nothing specific to go on . \nWe needed high-quality intelligence , without which weapons inspections were going nowhere . \nI had tried my best to develop sources of information , but had been sabotaged by the CIA . \nThe failed June 1996 coup attempt had largely been determined by domestic American political considerations . \nLike President George HW Bush before him , Clinton and his political handlers were sensitive to public perception in a presidential election year . \nThis shaped both the coup 's mission -LRB- get Saddam -RRB- and its timing -LRB- early summer , before the Republicans had nailed down their candidate -RRB- . \nNot only was the 1996 plot chiefly a `` wag the dog '' scenario , but once again , any chance of Iraq disarming under UN supervision had been cynically undermined by the larger US objective of regime change Ritter discovered that the barracks there belonged to the Radwaniyah Platoon - Saddam 's personal bodyguard , equipped with a fleet of silver Mercedes sedans . \nTwo of these cars were badly damaged by machine-gun fire and rocket attack - evidence of a recent assassination attempt on senior regime officials . \nThe mystery of the 3rd Battalion This U-2 photograph , provided by the CIA , was taken on June 11 1996 , just as Ritter 's Unscom 150 weapons inspection was getting under way . \nWhile searching the barracks here , Ritter found files declaring that the 3rd Battalion -LRB- Special Forces -RRB- of the Special Republican Guard had been liquidated and its members placed on `` administrative leave '' . \nRitter recalled that the 3rd Battalion had earlier been placed `` off limits '' by the CIA . \n`` I now realized what this meant : ` Stay away , those are our guys ' . '' \nThe sensitivity of Site 1a led to prolonged stand-offs between weapons inspectors and Iraqi soldiers . \nIntelligence gathered from Unscom 's covert listening post in Baghdad suggested that the vehicles may have been used to move material and documents they did not wish inspectors to find . \nThis is an edited extract from Iraq Confidential : The Untold Story of America 's Intelligence Conspiracy , by Scott Ritter , with foreword by Seymour Hersh , published by IB Tauris Letters for publication should be sent to : letters@guardian.co.uk If you need help using the site : userhelp@guardian.co.uk Call the main Guardian and Observer switchboard : Scott Ritter on failed CIA plot to overthrow the Saddam Hussein 's regime using UN weapons inspection This article appeared on p8 of the G2 section of the Guardian on 01.25 BST on Wednesday 28 September 2005 The latest news and comment from our team of reporters , writers and editors in the US Auto update every minute On | Off Busfield : `` Beagles come in 2 sizes 13 inch and 15 inch . \nLike a MacBook Pro '' says @Mister_Solomon : Westminster Dog Show - live ! \n"}

'' \nBoth the US and UK governments declined to comment on the Mirror 's allegations . \n`` We are not going to dignify something so outlandish with a response , '' a White House official said . \nA Downing Street spokesman added : `` We have got nothing to say about this story . \nWe do n't comment on leaked documents .

{"id": "10", "time": "2005-12-03", "text": "Norman Davies applauds Tony Judt 's Postwar , one American 's personal view of our continent 's recent history Contemporary history is not an easy option . \nIt deals with incomplete processes and with the uncertain outcomes of recent events . \nTimothy Garton Ash , the mastercraftsman of the genre , has written of `` analytical reportage '' demanding the highest skills of both historian and journalist . \nBy these criteria , Tony Judt has splendid qualifications . \nAn authority on modern French intellectual history , he is director of the Remarque Institute in New York , entrusted with the task of explaining Europe to America . \nHe has also involved himself in current international relations , notably in the former Yugoslavia and the Middle East . \nHe is a principled critic of the Iraq war . \nWith Postwar , however , Judt moves up into the ranks of the grands simplificateurs . \nHe dares to expound the sum total of Europe since 1945 in a seamless narrative . \nBy presenting `` an avowedly personal interpretation '' , he accepts that his personal make-up will be reflected in the end product . \nHis French expertise , his Jewish background , his American mission and , one suspects , a mis-spent political youth can all help to explain particular , and not always felicitous , points of emphasis . \nThis is history-writing with a human face , as well as with brainpower . \nNaturally enough , the `` advance praise '' on the cover is over the top . \nLord Owen begs a question or two by praising a book about `` the true Europe '' . \nThe publishers announce a volume that supposedly deals `` uniquely '' with the whole of Europe . \nIn this connection , the structure of the text deserves comment . \nSome of the 24 chapters are pan-European . \nAn excellent essay on `` The Coming of the Cold War '' , for example , discusses both western and eastern factors in the growing conflict , before revealing critical links to the Korean war and to France 's sponsorship of the nascent European project . \nYet the majority of chapters deal separately either with the west or the east ; and the west has the numerical edge . \nGiven 40 years of the iron curtain , the treatment is justified . \nJudt 's style is crisp . \nComplicated subjects are tamed by uncomplicated sentences ; and four or five slim paragraphs fit on to every page . \nThe brisk pace is accompanied by fine quotes , lively anecdotes and acerbic phrases . \nI particularly liked Franjo Tudjman being `` notoriously ecumenical in his prejudices '' . \nThe 800 pages of the main text do not weigh heavily . \nThe terminology occasionally lacks precision . \n`` Russia '' and `` the USSR '' should not be used as interchangeables in a book of this quality . \nIn the Soviet era , for instance , Poland never played `` Russia '' at football -LRB- although a Polish goalkeeper is once said to have been imprisoned for saving a penalty -RRB- . \nSimilarly , the careless use of `` small states '' smacks of Churchill 's imperial division of the world into `` giants '' and `` pygmies '' . \nEurope has countries of all shapes and sizes . \nAnd `` the insecurity of small-state nationalism '' is doubly dubious . \nInsecurity is a psychological trait of all nationalisms . \nRegarding western Europe , Judt stands on firm ground . \nHe puts France and Germany center stage , and nicely elucidates the lurches and fumbles by which the European movement has progressed . \nBritain , including Northern Ireland , is not sidelined ; Scandinavia emerges in `` The Social-Democratic Moment '' ; and there are first-rate sections on the retreat from empire in the 1960s and on the rehabilitation of the Mediterranean countries in the 1970s . \nJudt , however , is impervious to religion , unmoved by music and rather complacent about non-French and non-political branches of art and culture . \nParisian intellectual warlords and east European dissidents , though important , do not tell the whole story . \nAuthors of syntheses must sometimes try to empathise with incongenial subjects . \nThe attack on the late pope as a `` parochial '' idolater is demeaning . \nAs a paid-up professor of philosophy , with a PhD on Schelerian phenomenology , John Paul II could have offered Judt a much-needed tutorial on comprehending the full spectrum of human ideas and experience . \nSurprisingly , therefore , Judt 's expos of the workings of the Soviet bloc is almost magnificent . \nHe is specially good on Czechoslovakia , and carefully differentiates the reactions of different countries to successive crises . \nHis chapter `` Into the Whirlwind '' -LRB- after Ginzburg -RRB- is a model , nuanced analysis of Stalinist practices : from the monopoly power of the party-state to its mad economics , its colonialism and its gargantuan organs of repression . \n-LRB- One statistic speaks volumes : the Stasi employed five times as many operatives in the DDR as the Gestapo employed in the entire Reich . -RRB- \nNone the less , one has to say `` almost '' because of Judt 's strange reluctance to give the Stalinist spade its real name . \nElsewhere , he accepts the fact of communism 's criminality . \nYet the term `` mass murder '' does not occur until page 559 , echoing Solzhenitsyn , and the term `` crimes against humanity '' does not surface until page 681 in relation to ex-Yugoslavia . \nAs Judt knows perfectly well , Milosevic compared to Stalin , or to Stalin 's pupil , Mao , is a garden gnome . \nHe records Tarrou 's good intention , from La Peste , `` to reject everything that makes people die '' . \nIt is a fair motto . \nSimilarly , the account of the Soviet bloc 's demise is very nearly brilliant . \nThere is no need to invent an antithesis between the role of Solidarity - which is dismissed as a `` sideshow '' - and subsequent events in Moscow . \nSurely the two were complementary . \nBut Judt is absolutely correct to concentrate on Gorbachev 's bungling . \nIt would be still better if discussion of the mishandling of the nationalities issue were not postponed to a further , exquisite section on the Baltic states , and if the meaning of glasnost in the Soviet context were properly explained . \n-LRB- Initially it meant internal party discussion . -RRB- \nRevered in the west for reversing foreign policy , `` Gorbie '' was widely reviled throughout the USSR as a clueless reformer . \nHe knew very little about Soviet history , and hence about the foundations of the system which he headed . \nPostwar is worth buying for one judgment alone : Gorbachev `` had no idea what he was doing '' . \nUnlike the USSR , the US features only sporadically , like the ghost at the feast . \nPerhaps the author assumed that his readers ' grasp of the American background was adequate . \nAt all events , the later chapters , `` Varieties of Europe '' and `` Europe as a Way of Life '' , stress the contrasts with the US . \nAnd they end on an upbeat . \n`` The 21st century '' , writes Judt , `` might yet belong to Europe . '' \nErrors and omissions inevitably occur . \nApart from religion and the arts , the thinnest coverage relates to the Irish republic , to the big regions of France and Germany , and to European regionalism in general . \nWhat a pity , too , that Judt does not share his thoughts here on the founding of Israel - surely an important topic in `` The Legacy of War '' . \n-LRB- In 2003 , he courageously criticised Israel as an `` anachronistic '' `` ethno-state '' , thereby earning himself a rich crop of inappropriate epithets . -RRB- \nOverall , the great schoolmaster in the sky might mark this effort at 8 or 9 out of 10 . \nDetermined nit-pickers , with their own priorities , might rate it lower . \nThe only sensible response to their carping is : `` Let them produce something better . '' \nIn reality , it is most unlikely that Judt 's achievement will be superseded soon . \nNorman Davies 's next book , Europe at War , will be published by Macmillan in 2006 . \nTo order Postwar for # 23 with free UK p & p call Guardian book service on 08708360875 . \nWrite your review of this or any other book , find out what other readers thought or add it to your lists Letters for publication should be sent to : letters@guardian.co.uk If you need help using the site : userhelp@guardian.co.uk Call the main Guardian and Observer switchboard : Review : Postwar by Tony Judt This article appeared on p8 of the Guardian review section of the Guardian on 01.54 GMT on Saturday 3 December 2005 Latest news and views from the Guardian 's books team paullaity : Read this : clever and funny and rightly cutting . \n"}
{"id": "28", "time": "2005-12-03", "text": "John Gray , academic , writer and public intellectual , was an unlikely Thatcherite , then an early Blairite . \nHe is now the scourge of neocons and the disciples of science and rationalism If you had to fit the message of John Gray 's 14 books and innumerable articles on a sandwich board , it would be simple : you 're all doomed . \nQuite who is doomed , and why , has varied with the development of his thought . \nHe started off as a Thatcherite and cold warrior , convinced that the postwar consensus and welfare state could not last . \nThen he became an early Blairite , warning against the dangers of Thatcherism . \nNow he attacks Blair as a dangerous neocon ; he has been an unyielding opponent of the Iraq war and he is convinced that globalisation will end in a welter of resource wars and ecological collapse . \nPeter Wilby , a former editor of the New Statesman who published him for three years , says : `` He 's one of life 's sceptics , really . \nAny kind of ideology - the more he looks at it , the more he decides that it crumbles apart . \nNone of the emperors has any clothes so far as John is concerned . '' \nIn all this , he sees himself as consistent . \nAs a polemicist he has always argued against the conventional wisdom , and usually been about five years ahead of it . \nAs a political philosopher , he believes he has always had a guiding principle : that there are certain limits on human life which politics can never abolish , and never wholly work around . \nUtopian or universal schemes will only make things worse . \nThis sounds like conservatism ; but he also believes that real , reactionary conservatism is no longer possible : `` The right today likes to imagine that it is the voice of the past . \nIn truth ... the fate of the right in the late modern age is to destroy what remains of the past in a vain attempt to recover it . '' \nGray was born in 1947 into a world which the market has quite swept away : the working class of Tyneside , when they still had jobs . \nHis father was a shipyard joiner in South Shields . \nThey never thought of themselves as poor , he says ; others remember it differently . \nHis childhood friend Robert Colls , now a historian at the University of Leicester , who grew up in the same part of town , remembers `` this poor brilliant boy living in a mixed area of town . \nHis dad was disabled in his 50s . \nI think he had a hard time on the money front . '' \nIn 1968 , he went up to Oxford to read PPE on a scholarship . \nIsaiah Berlin was at Oxford then , working on the most subtle and powerful justification for liberalism that anyone managed in the 20th century ; Gray , who became a friend , set out to overthrow it . \nLiberalism , said Berlin , is valuable because it lets people live in many different ways , seeking many different goals . \nBut no one society , Gray objects , can encompass all the humanly fulfilling ways to live . \nRussia under totalitarianism\\/communism was in some respects less materialistic and more respectful of culture than it is now , but these virtues were made possible only by a dreadful tyranny . \nHis arguments on this topic are pitched in academic prose , but they can be boiled down into one line of Mick Jagger 's : We ca n't get no satisfaction . \nWe are not the sort of creatures who could get lasting satisfaction , not just because we often want bad things instead of good ones , but because the goods we want ca n't be reconciled with each other . \nThe Australian philosopher George Crowder claims that Gray must logically endorse Stalin and Hitler as offering legitimate models of society , something Gray cheerfully denies . \nThe fact that our values , though real , are sometimes incompatible does n't mean they have nothing in common . \nIt must be possible , he claims , to build some kind of minimal universal moral framework , even if this does not lead to liberalism : `` No society can be called good which rests on torture . '' \nHis pessimistic twist on Berlin is also part of the rootless conservatism which has made him denounce the projects of the right as passionately as he denounced Marxism . \nHe believes that human life can always be made better , but that this process does not approach perfection . \nNew problems are always arising ; old gains can easily be lost . \nThere is no steady ladder of progress ; but we are able , sometimes , to run up the down escalator . \nHe rejects the idea that political debate starts from human rights . \nThe process seems to him the other way round : that `` rights '' are something that emerge from a political process , and different rights may be produced under different political systems . \nNone is inherent in all human beings , and the ones that we do recognize may conflict with each other . \nWhen they do so , we ca n't honestly resolve the problem by logic which everyone comes to accept , nor even , as Americans do , by handing the matter over to a Supreme Court . \nThe final decision , says Gray , must be political . \nAs a working-class undergraduate , he was a Thatcherite before Thatcher herself , a believer in the market , and a critic of planned economies . \nHe read Hayek in the late 1960s , and understood his essential point to be that markets in some sense know more than any of the people who operate in them . \nIt followed that state planning , and social engineering based on rational discussion were always likely to go wrong . \nThis much was common among Thatcherites in the 70s , but unlike most Thatcherites , he saw that ripping down communities to make way for a market was itself a form of social engineering , though an often anti-social one . \n`` Give him any collection of pigeons and he 'll set a cat among them , '' says his friend the academic and publisher Henry Hardy . \nGray 's views on council-house sales are a good example of his contrarian style - and of his appetite for anchoring large arguments in historical detail . \nThe sale of council houses , he said , might have been good for the Conservative party in the short term , but it did nothing to decrease dependency on the state , as it was supposed to do . \nAll it changed was the form of subsidy . \n`` Spending on housing benefit during 1996-67 was over 10 times the total cost of housing benefits in 1979-80 . \nPublic expenditure on social housing was replaced , many times over , by rent rebates and assistance with the payment of mortgages . \nThe price of privatising municipal housing in Britain has been a colossal increase in welfare dependency . '' \nThis kind of inconsistency in Thatcherism led to his conversion to Blairism . \nAs a Blairite in the days before there was a Blair government , he started to attack the costs of the free market : `` In the United States free markets have contributed to social breakdown on a scale unknown in any other developed country . \nFamilies are weaker in America than in any other country . \nAt the same time , social order has been propped up by a policy of mass incarceration . \nNo other advanced industrial country , aside from post-communist Russia , uses imprisonment as a means of social control on the scale of the United States . \nFree markets , the desolation of families and communities and the use of the sanctions of criminal law as a last recourse against social collapse go in tandem . '' \nThatcherism was not just a local phenomenon . \nIt was also recognized as a global symbol , and this was the next symbol against which he charged . \nNothing could be more alien to his temperament than the 90s ' bland optimism that history was over and the whole world must converge , with greater or lesser success , on the model of the United States of America . \nFor one thing , he argued , globalisation depends on the world being different . \nIf it were all the same , there would be no reason to invest in one part of it rather than another . \nThe vast , destabilising currency markets take as their premise the inequalities between nations , and then act to enlarge them , not to bring countries together . \nThe spread of technology was inevitable and irreversible . \nBut there was no reason to suppose that the spread of American technology meant the spread of American models of society ; and the examples of countries that had successfully enriched themselves with modern technology , such as Japan , shows that their differences from western models were essential to their success . \nAlthough he was prolific - 12 books - and successful , Gray was little known outside academic circles until the mid-90s . \nHis first post , at the University of East Anglia , had been succeeded by a job at Jesus College , Oxford , where he remained for nearly 15 years . \nHe held visiting professorships at Harvard and Yale . \nHis writing has always had a chameleon quality . \nWhen he writes about Berlin his sentences stretch and then tangle and convolute like brain cells . \nWhen he writes about his favorite philosopher , the Spanish aphorist Santayana , his own style becomes elegant and precise . \nIn 1998 he moved to the LSE , as professor of European thought , and in 2000 he published Straw Dogs , with Granta , rather than Routledge , which marked his breakthrough as a public intellectual . \nIt is written in a wrought-up , aphoristic style . \n`` When will the Jews be forgiven the Holocaust ? '' \nhe asks at one stage . \nBut it was very widely and respectfully reviewed . \nHis view of the world cut through the antidepressant euphoria of the 90s with a sense of a much nastier future ahead . \nIn Straw Dogs , his pessimism became truly global , and entangled with environmentalism . \nThe hubris which he had been denouncing all his life , first in socialism , then in neo-liberalism , was now identified with the notion of growth . \nJust as before , nemesis was to be supplied by nature . \nBut this time it was not human nature that would ensure our doom , but nature itself . \nSince then , a series of short , punchy books has kept up with the troubles of the age . \nHis essays for the New Statesman are being republished as Heresies with a characteristic subtitle : Against Progress and Other Illusions . \nHis fiercest scorn has switched to the disciples of rationalism and of science : `` Of all modern delusions , the idea that we live in a secular age is the furthest from reality ... liberal humanism itself is very obviously a religion - a shoddy replica of Christian faith markedly more irrational than the original article , and in recent times more harmful .

'' \nMr Lucey hoped to lead another group into the country when security improved . \nMr Razuqi , his office dark and hot in the wake of another power cut , suggested visitors could dye their hair and wear traditional robes to look more Iraqi . \nHelmets and body armor would give the game away . \nAn attempt to write a brochure was abandoned because libraries with background material were burned and looted two years ago . \n`` But we can guide people ourselves , '' the tourism manager said . \nThose who can not wait for the Heathrow link can reach Iraq by flying from Istanbul to Irbil , in the relatively peaceful north , or fly from Syria or Jordan to Baghdad , or drive or sail from Kuwait or the United Arab Emirates to Basra . \nThe city 's lagoons are striking from the air but corkscrew descents - a stomach-churning defense against missiles - can spoil the experience . \nThough the airport doubles as a British military base the terminal is often eerily deserted , with all but essential personnel and visitors banned . \nSoldiers in armored Land Rovers trundle from the main gate , a maze of blast walls and razor wire , but tourists would have to arrange their own rides into town , a former playground for the Gulf region degraded by two decades of war and neglect . \nThe four-star Shatt al-Arab hotel is occupied by British troops but there are a dozen lesser hotels with spare rooms . \nThe Mirbad , known to some guests as the Morbid , is popular for the visibility of guards with assault rifles . \nOn Thursday a Shia cleric , Ali Abdul-Hussein , became the latest victim of sporadic assassinations which are blamed on rival militias and crooked police officers . \nBut compared with Baghdad the port city is tranquil , with military patrols and bombs a rarity . \n`` Just 1 % of all incidents Iraq-wide happen here , '' said Stuart Innes , the British consul general . \n`` Property prices are up and we are nearing a tipping point for investment . \nBasra is blazing a trail . '' \nHe displayed a 1970 photo of a white-jacketed waiter serving drinks at a corniche casino , swans and yachts gliding in the background . \n`` It used to be like Monte Carlo . '' \nThe Foreign and Commonwealth Office advises against all but essential travel to Basra . \nTourists who ignore that will find museums gutted , theaters shut , streets reeking with rubbish and sewage and waterways littered with capsized vessels , including Saddam Hussein 's yacht . \nThe compensations are dazzling mosques , historic towns such as Qurna nearby , and marshes said to be the site of the Garden of Eden . \nWhen not disguised , westerners tend to be greeted warmly , if curiously . \n`` Problem in the head ? \nWhy are you here ? '' \none waiter asked the Guardian . \nOne westerner said he acted deaf and dumb and even pretended to use sign language when out in public with his translator and guide . \n`` If they are ready to face the danger then they should come , though my advice is to wait for security to improve , '' said Khalaf al-Easa , the head of the city 's Iraqi Islamic party , an Arab Sunni group hostile to the occupation . \nSince the invasion religiously conservative Shias have turned what had been an open , liberal society into something closer to Iran , with alcohol banned and women strongly encouraged to wear the veil . \nOnly men can sunbathe . \nBlack market beer and whisky can be bought from back-alley traders in a slum nicknamed Chechnya for its banditry . \nBut Mr Musabah , the governor , opened the door to an alcohol dispensation for tourists . \n`` In their hotels , maybe , '' he said . \n"}
{"id": "104", "time": "2005-01-13", "text": "Iraq Survey Group concludes dictator destroyed weapons years before invasion Thursday 13 January 2005 03.10 GMT The US investigators searching for Saddam Hussein 's alleged weapons of mass destruction have given up the hunt and left Iraq with an appeal to the Pentagon for the release of several Iraqi scientists still being questioned , it was reported yesterday . \nCharles Duelfer , who led the Iraq Survey Group , has returned to the US and will deliver a final report in the spring that will be almost identical to the interim assessment he delivered to Congress last October . \nThat assessment found Saddam had destroyed his last weapons of mass destruction more than 10 years ago , and his capacity to build new ones had been dwindling for years by the time of the second Gulf war . \n`` Charlie has left Iraq , '' an intelligence official said yesterday . \n`` In terms of the weapons hunt in a proactive sense , it has concluded , and the report is being tweaked a bit but it will be largely unchanged . '' \nBut he added : `` There is a considerable amount of document exploitation to be done that will continue to occur and leads that come out of the exploitation will be followed up . '' \nThe Washington Post said the ISG had made `` several pleas '' to the Pentagon to release the Iraqi scientists , who have been held for nearly two years and who have been interviewed extensively . \nThe scientists include General Amir al-Saadi , who negotiated with UN inspectors on behalf of the Saddam regime ; Rihab Taha , a biologist also known as Dr Germ ; her husband , Amir Rashid , a former oil minister ; and Huda Amash , a biologist nicknamed Mrs Anthrax by UN inspectors . \nGen Saadi 's German-born wife Helma told the Guardian last night that she had heard from US sources that Donald Rumsfeld , the US defense secretary , had approved her husband 's release some weeks after the October report was submitted . \nHe had checked with the Iraqi justice minister who said he had no objection . \n`` I understand the matter is with the prime minister , Ayad Allawi , now . \nI do n't know why it is taking so long , '' she said . \nBy chance , the Red Cross arranged yesterday for Gen Saadi to make a rare phone call to his wife . \n`` He did n't sound optimistic , '' she said . \n`` He said he 's kept in the dark . \nNo one tells him anything . \nHe asked for more books . '' \nLast night the White House press secretary , Scott McClellan , said there no longer was an active search for weapons . \n`` There may be a couple , a few people , that are focused on that , '' he said , `` but it has largely concluded . '' \nHe added : `` If they have any reports of -LRB- weapons of mass destruction -RRB- obviously they 'll continue to follow up on those reports . \n`` A lot of their mission is focused elsewhere now . '' \nHe said the final Duelfer report `` is not going to fundamentally alter '' the earlier findings , which said Saddam not only had no weapons of mass destruction and had not made any since 1991 , but that he had no capability of making any either . \nMany thousands of pages of Saddam-era documents are still being translated and analyzed , but most weapons experts believe they are unlikely to change the fundamental ISG assessment that the former regime had rid itself of weapons of mass destruction many years before the invasion . \nAfter Mr Duelfer 's presentation to Congress in October , a senior ISG official said he was only returning to Baghdad `` to tie up odds and ends '' , with no real expectation of further discoveries . \nUS officials said the operation was being wrapped up because there was little expectation of finding any substantial new evidence and the hunt could no longer be justified in view of the rising danger to the investigators . \nDespite the end of the search , President George Bush last night said he remained convinced that he was right to go to war on Saddam . \nIn an interview with ABC television 's Barbara Walters , Mr Bush admitted : `` I felt like we 'd find weapons of mass destruction , or like many many here in the United States , many around the world , the United Nations , thought he had weapons of mass destruction . '' \nBut asked directly whether the invasion of Iraq was worth the cost of an increasingly violent war , Mr Bush said : `` Oh , absolutely . '' \n"}

'' \nHe still gets requests for a recording or footage of the speech , but none exists , which must give the Sky team who were also embedded with the battalion pause for thought . \nEarly in our conversation the colonel calls the speech `` ill-advised '' , but he is joking - he has a taste for irony . \nHe is proud to have made it . \n`` The war had gone off ahead of time and everyone was wondering when the first scuds would start landing , '' he recalls . \n`` It was all very edgy . \nFor the first time I was certain there was going to be a war , and I was conscious that I was going to be asking young men to take human life . \nThat 's a big step and perhaps some of them had n't considered it . \nHaving served in many conflicts , I also had no expectation , even with a miracle , of bringing everyone home alive . \nSo I knew for a lot of these young people that this was the final chapter in their lives , and I wanted to explain to them why it was important , why they were there , why this was happening . '' \nIn the event , there was a miracle - none of his battalion were killed . \nHow did his men respond to his message ? \n`` They heard and understood exactly what I 'd said and behaved impeccably -LRB- during the war -RRB- . \nThey made a huge contribution in the areas where they were and made it a better place . \nIn the short time -LRB- less than two months -RRB- we were there , we made a difference . \nFor instance , within a week of us arriving , the city of Al Amarah had water , light , the sewage was under control , there were policemen on the streets and the fire brigades were working . \nIt 's now one of the most violent places in Iraq . '' \nCollins would defend his regiment 's role to the last ditch . \nBut he makes no attempt to defend the war itself . \n`` I went with the Irish to Iraq with the intention of liberating the Iraqis , with the cry that ` small nations can be free ' . \nBut what is happening there is much more reminiscent of American policy than British colonial policy . \nLove it or hate it , British colonial policy is about acting in partnership with the people you come across for mutual benefit . \nAmerican policy is all about subjugation . \nMy view is that we were sold a dummy . '' \nAlongside pictures of Collins in battle fatigues - steel-grey hair , shades , flash watch , huge cigar - the speech encapsulated how we , the media , the public , wanted to see our commanders : as larger-than-life heroes . \nWhile not averse to grandiloquent gestures - he is puffing on a vast cigar when we meet in the garden of his new detached house in Whitstable , Kent , and there is a Mercedes sports car with the roof down on the drive - he does not accept the hero tag . \n`` I 'm not a hero . \nIf there are heroes it 's the collective men of the Royal Irish Regiment . \nThey are the heroes because it was their actions and their proficiency , hard won on many operations , that made us a success . '' \nThe army certainly did n't treat him as a hero . \nThey disliked his public persona and vigorously pursued a series of war crimes allegations made against him by a US major with whom he had crossed swords in Iraq and even more serious allegations by the Sunday Express and Sunday Mirror , which accused his battalion of murdering Iraqis in cold blood and burying the bodies in shallow graves . \nA commission of inquiry eventually exonerated him on all charges , but in a memoir published today he is scathing about the way he was abandoned - worse , undermined - by the organization to which he had devoted his life . \n`` The army was attacking me with anonymous briefings , '' he alleges in the book . \n`` It had unwittingly made me the British Dreyfus . '' \nHe is sure he knows who in the army high command was out to get him , but says he has insufficient evidence to name him . \nCollins was awarded damages against the Sunday Express and Sunday Mirror - he is building a gazebo in the garden with the proceeds - and has no intention of being on the losing side in the libel lottery . \n`` When the war crimes allegations were made , '' he says , `` for some in the high command they were like a gift from God and they pursued them with the utmost vigor . \nI know who was ultimately behind the whole thing , but I do n't have documentary proof . \nHe is a general who has never even been in a fight in a playground and feels hugely threatened by combat soldiers . \nHe moved heaven and earth to get me . '' \nI tell Collins that he reminds me of the late Colonel David Hackworth , the much-decorated Vietnam commander who was supposedly the model for Colonel Kilgore in Apocalypse Now . \nHe says he is currently reading Hackworth 's autobiography , About Face , and admits to seeing parallels in their careers : battlefield heroes who then turned their fire on their deskbound superiors -LRB- Hackworth called them `` perfumed princes '' -RRB- . \nCan armies , underpinned by discipline , simply not accommodate mavericks in the long term ? \n`` I think the army will accommodate people like me , '' says Collins , `` but is n't able to just at the moment . \nWhat we have essentially is the army being led by people who were brought up in the cold war when the most important thing in their calendar was the Rhine army horse show . \nThey 're now finding it very difficult to cope with the fact that the army is at war -LRB- with terrorism -RRB- . '' \nThe key to understanding Collins may be that his attachment was to his beloved Royal Irish Regiment -LRB- formerly the Royal Irish Rangers -RRB- first ; the British army a distant second . \nHis home is filled with regimental memorabilia - there is even a Rangers badge in the loo . \nThin-lipped English officers who criticised him for putting himself in the frontline too much failed to understand his Irishness and the way it conditioned his passionate leadership . \n`` The Irish way is to be in the frontline , '' he says . \n`` Why have an Irish regiment if you do n't expect them to behave like paddies ? \nOur military culture in Ireland has n't changed in a thousand years . \nThey still expect their chieftain to lead from the front . '' \nAttachment to the Royal Irish runs in Collins ' family : his grandfather and an uncle were both in the regiment and his grandfather 's first world war medals are proudly displayed in a case mounted on the wall . \nCollins himself was an army cadet at 11 , joined the Territorials at 17 and was commissioned into the army at 21 . \nHis father , a Dubliner who set up a printer 's shop in Belfast , could n't join up because he was hard of hearing . \nHis mother was a devout presbyterian , and from her perhaps Collins has derived faith , belief in social order and a loathing of discrimination . \nHe says that at Queen 's University , Belfast , where he studied economics , most of his friends were nationalists . \nStripped from his beloved regiment , Collins cuts an odd figure . \nA less colonel-like person you could not meet . \nHe is wearing jeans , sandals , a bronze bracelet , one of those fashionable wristbands -LRB- a green `` support our troops '' one -RRB- , and a perfect white T-shirt that shows off his almost flat stomach and muscular arms . \nHe is 45 , but far fitter than he was 10 years ago : the photographs in the lounge show a flabbier , less dashing officer , with brown hair and an old-fashioned haircut . \nHe is amiable but a little detached , with steely-blue eyes that only occasionally settle on you . \nMostly , he is speaking into the middle-distance , lecturing on grand themes , speaking to some unseen army . \nHe wants so much to be taken seriously - as a thinker on Northern Irish politics -LRB- he foresees a political realignment -RRB- , third world aid -LRB- he 's been there - largely pointless -RRB- , state education -LRB- `` beyond repair '' -RRB- , and global affairs . \nHe recognizes that he has now reached a fork in the road . \nHe was courted by Conservative and Unionist politicians and does n't rule out standing for parliament in the future , but wants to get experience of life outside the army first . \nHe is also hoping to present a television series on army history . \nHis home is like a military museum - pity any burglar who tries to take on this super-fit former SAS man with his large collection of Gurkha knives - and you wonder how he will negotiate a fresh beginning outside the army . \nWill he ever free himself from the shadow of that speech ? \n`` Hopefully I will do other things in my life and it will become just a one-hit wonder , a bit like the birdie song , '' he jokes . \nBut , in truth , he accepts that Ms Oliver 's excellent shorthand will provide the inscription on his tombstone . \n`` I 'm sure when I drop off my perch at whatever age , the great speech will come back in the obituaries . \nThe moment it happened , it changed my life and nothing would ever be the same again . \nBut war is like that . \nIt changes everything and you can never go back to the time before .

'' \nA verdict is expected as early as today . \nThroughout the proceedings in the small , dark-panelled court room in Fort Hood army base , the burly Graner had been almost ebullient . \n`` I feel fantastic . \nI 'm still smiling , '' he said after proceedings wound down yesterday . \nAsked on the opening day of his trial if he felt any remorse for what went on at Abu Ghraib , the soldier rolled his eyes and smirked . \nIf he is found guilty by a jury of 10 soldiers , he could face 17 and a half years in prison for conspiracy , assault , maltreatment of detainees , indecency and dereliction of duty . \nGraner 's last-minute decision yesterday afternoon not to testify must in some ways have arrived as a relief for the Pentagon , removing any threat that the defiant soldier would try to implicate his superiors in the abuse . \nIn the Pentagon 's view , the abuse at Abu Ghraib stopped at the enlisted ranks , and Graner was the `` primary torturer '' , a brutal sadist who whistled as he administered beatings - once so hard that he broke a chair over a detainee - and threw prisoners ' rations into the toilet . \nGraner is already linked indelibly in the public mind with the most horrifying images from Abu Ghraib : giving a thumbs up over a pyramid of naked Iraqi detainees , and cajoling his then lover , Private Lynndie England , to pose with a dog leash around the neck of another prisoner . \nAlthough Graner 's defense put on an air of optimism yesterday , the decision to rest their arguments comes after the judge repeatedly refused their attempts to introduce evidence from use-of-force experts and other testimony to advance their case that piling naked detainees into a human pyramid and other practices were a legitimate form of prisoner control . \nHowever , the trial did hear for the first time that officers ordered the sexual humiliation of an Iraqi detainee as an interrogation strategy . \nMegan Ambuhl , who it emerged yesterday also had a sexual relationship with Graner , told the court interrogators used female guards to sexually humiliate prisoners . \n`` They asked me to sit in the shower , and to point and laugh at the detainees , '' said Ms Ambuhl , who pleaded guilty last year for her role in the abuse . \nAnother guard , Sgt Kenneth Davis , who has not been charged , said : `` I thought the military intelligence was doing some pretty weird things with the detainees .

{"id": "198", "time": "2005-02-05", "text": "Depression cut the naturalist Richard Mabey off from the natural world . \nHe charts his slow process of recovery in Nature Cure 244pp , Chatto & Windus , # 15.99 From ancient Greece , Rome and China to the present , there has been a persistent belief in the restorative power of nature . \nThat belief has formed the bedrock of the passion for gardening , the enduring literary genre of pastoral , the concept of a national park and the philosophy of Romanticism -LRB- together with its successors such as the Arts and Crafts movement -RRB- . \nIt also underpins the profitability of vast segments of the tourist and heritage industries . \nThe English are particularly susceptible to the lure of nature : witness our gardens , our anglers , birdwatchers and ramblers . \nThere is a long tradition that defines Englishness by way of landscape and what William Wordsworth called `` local affections '' as opposed to more brazen manifestations of national identity such as flags , anthems and a written constitution . \nOne of the wonders of English language and culture is the richness of our regional dialect words for natural phenomena : we have as many words for woodland as the Inuit supposedly have for snow , while almost any species of wildflower can be identified by a score of evocative local names . \nThe most comprehensive and engaging encyclopedia of those names and the customs associated with them is Richard Mabey 's Flora Britannica , published in 1996 , the product of years of research that drew not only on the author 's own deep botanical learning but also on hundreds of contributors from around the country who provided him with an abundance of local knowledge and lore . \nThe hardest task in any writer 's life is to start again after coming to the end of the book they know they will be remembered for . \nSo it was that Mabey fell into severe clinical depression some time after the publication of Flora Britannica . \nBeing a man so deeply rooted in his locality -LRB- the Chilterns -RRB- that he had lived almost all his life in the very house he was brought up in , he also experienced a sense of radical dislocation upon moving house . \nHe went eastward to the haunting but sometimes oppressive landscape of East Anglia - home to a great tradition of literary melancholia that runs from George Crabbe to WG Sebald . \nUpon moving , Mabey packed away most of his library . \nBut among the couple of hundred essential books he kept with him was `` most of John Clare '' . \nNature Cure is several books in one : an honest memoir of the experience of mental illness , a gentle but firm manifesto for a greener way of life , a compendium of delicate observation and curious nature lore . \nIt is also a love song to Clare . \nThe opening chapter is called `` The Flitting '' , the title of Clare 's great poem about his sense of disorientation on moving from the house in which he had lived as both boy and man . \nFor Clare , relocation to a village just three-and-a-half miles further into the Great Fen was enough to unleash his `` blue devils '' and start him on the road to the lunatic asylum . \nMabey actually spends a brief period as a patient in the St Andrew 's mental hospital in Northampton , where Clare was consigned for more than 20 years . \nBut the late 20th-century naturalist -LRB- who writes prose of a lyric poise that could almost be called poetry -RRB- was luckier than the early 19th-century poet-naturalist . \nClare 's depression was compounded by lost love in the shape of a girl called Mary Joyce , whereas Mabey 's cycle of desolation is broken by the arrival of new love in the shape of a woman called Poppy , whose passion is `` helping to make a facsimile of a Benedictine herb garden in the heart of Norwich '' . \nBoth name and occupation seem almost too good to be true : the Romantic poets sought to drown their melancholy in the fume of the opium poppy , while Mabey 's new partner offers love , hope and herbal tea . \nThe book begins with an exquisite description of how the author once found a fledgling swift in an attic , lying `` with its crescent wings stretched out stiffly , unable to take off '' . \nThere is poetry in the juxtaposition of `` swift '' and `` stiffly '' - consonance of sound to highlight dissonance of sense , the swift being the least stiff and most aerodynamic of our summer visitors . \nMabey picks up the bird and hurls it out of the window . \nInstinct kicks in and instantly the swift is racing on its first flight . \nAnd then the naturalist 's knowledge is used to breathtaking literary effect : `` It would not touch down again until it came back to breed in two summers ' time . '' \nThe perpetual aerial motion , the sheer life , of the swift becomes a leitmotif throughout the book , a contrast to the living death of deep depression rendered in the image of an outdoorsman curled foetally in his bed all day , face to the wall . \nYet it is not the swift but Poppy - assisted by other good friends - who cures Mabey . \nHe cheerfully admits that his title is somewhat misleading . \nThe book actually reverses the pattern of the traditional English nature cure . \nThis is not a story in which a bracing morning walk or the sight of a diving marsh harrier restores the author 's faith in life . \nIt is a book about the terror of losing that connection to the natural world that had previously centred Mabey 's very being . \nThe depression and the slow process of recovery are played out against the distant backdrop of the build-up to the Iraq war and - closer to home - the relentless march of soil-destroying agribusiness and soul-destroying land development in East Anglia . \nMabey 's experience of severance from the `` common ground '' thus becomes a little allegory of the larger-scale ecocide that pervades modern capitalism and geopolitics . \nIf pushed too hard , this kind of analogy between the personal and the political runs the risk of terrible hubris - one thinks of reactions such as `` how dare Sylvia Plath compare her little psychodramas to the Holocaust , or Martin Amis speak of his family problems in the same breath as Stalin 's purges '' . \nBut the Iraq connection is by no means exiguous : the migration route of swift and house martin takes our avian asylum seekers over the war zone . \nMabey can make such connections because he is a writer who never shouts . \nIn its quiet way , Nature Cure moves between the nervous breakdown of an individual and the madness of the modern world with a prescience akin to that of TS Eliot 's Waste Land . \nJonathan Bate 's books include The Song of the Earth and John Clare : A Biography Letters for publication should be sent to : letters@guardian.co.uk If you need help using the site : userhelp@guardian.co.uk Call the main Guardian and Observer switchboard : Review : Nature Cure by Richard Mabey This article appeared on p10 of the Guardian review section of the Guardian on 01.41 GMT on Saturday 5 February 2005 Latest news and views from the Guardian 's books team paullaity : Read this : clever and funny and rightly cutting . \n"}
{"id": "71", "time": "2005-05-12", "text": "Thursday 12 May 2005 12.21 BST George Galloway , the newly elected MP for the anti-war Respect party in east London , this morning faces allegations from the US Senate over whether he benefited from the Iraq oil-for-food program run under Saddam Hussein . \nA US Senate committee report published today claims to have uncovered `` significant evidence '' that the former Labor MP was allocated millions of barrels of oil from the Saddam regime . \nIt bases its conclusions on previously disclosed documents from the Iraqi ministry of oil and interviews with senior officials of the regime , plus unnamed Iraqi sources . \nMr Galloway last night denied the allegations . \nHe told the Guardian : `` This committee has never spoken to me , never written to me and never asked me a single question and did not even acknowledge last year my offer to go and speak to them . \nIt is hardly an investigation . \n`` It is merely the repetition of false accusations that have been made and denied before . \nSomething does not become true because it is repeated by George Bush 's Senate majority . '' \nThe US report concludes : `` The evidence obtained by the sub-committee , including Hussein-era documents from the ministry of oil and testimony from senior Hussein officials , shows that Iraq granted George Galloway allocations for millions of barrels of oil under the oil-for-food program . \n`` Moreover , some evidence indicates that Galloway appeared to use a charity for children 's leukemia to conceal payments associated with at least one such allocation . '' \nLast night 's report was produced by the staff of the Senate 's permanent subcommittee on investigations , part of the committee on homeland security and government affairs . \nThe subcommittee is chaired by Norm Coleman , a Minnesota Republican , who has made it his mission to bring to book those he considers responsible for the Iraqi oil-for-food scandal . \nIn December he called for the resignation of the UN secretary general , Kofi Annan . \nMr Galloway said last night that the oil allocation vouchers were given to a Jordanian businessman , Fawaz Zureikat , who was chairman of his Mariam Appeal , a charity he set up to help a young Iraqi girl suffering from leukemia . \nThe MP said the appeal , part of a campaign against United Nations sanctions in Iraq , has already been investigated by the Charity Commission and no impropriety had been found . \n`` In other words , no money ended up in my pocket , '' Mr Galloway said . \nLast week Mr Galloway won a sensational victory against Labor 's Oona King in Bethnal Green . \nHe has consistently denied that he personally profited from Iraqi oil sales . \nHe won a high court libel action against the Daily Telegraph relating to similar allegations . \nThe US Senate committee report says it based its conclusions on documents from the Iraqi oil ministry , distinct from those alleged foreign ministry papers relied upon by the Telegraph . \n`` The documents presented in this report have no relation to those discussed in the Daily Telegraph piece . '' \nIn the course of the libel trial , Mr Galloway said he had never received or traded in oil , diverted money from the oil-for-food program , or used the Mariam Appeal as a front for his own personal gain . \nThe Senate committee report says that in April 2005 the vice-president of Iraq , Taha Yassin Ramadan , told the committee that Mr Galloway had been granted oil allocations `` because of his opinions about Iraq '' and because Mr Galloway `` wanted to lift the embargo against Iraq '' . \nAnother official , the report alleges , told investigators from the US Treasury that `` a member of the British parliament benefited tremendously from the illegal trade of oil by Iraq '' . \nThe report said : '' -LRB- The Source -RRB- stated that George Galloway , Labor Party , was the owner of a company that was involved in the Iraqi oil trade scheme . '' \nMr Galloway last night said that claim was `` preposterous '' . \n`` I do not own any companies . '' \n"}
{"id": "234", "time": "2005-01-22", "text": "The dangers of exporting democracy Bush 's crusade is based on a dangerous illusion and will fail Saturday 22 January 2005 12.22 GMT Although President Bush 's uncompromising second inaugural address does not so much as mention the words Iraq , Afghanistan and the war on terror , he and his supporters continue to engage in a planned reordering of the world . \nThe wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are but one part of a supposedly universal effort to create world order by `` spreading democracy '' . \nThis idea is not merely quixotic - it is dangerous . \nThe rhetoric implies that democracy is applicable in a standardised -LRB- western -RRB- form , that it can succeed everywhere , that it can remedy today 's transnational dilemmas , and that it can bring peace , rather than sow disorder . \nDemocracy is rightly popular . \nIn 1647 , the English Levellers broadcast the powerful idea that `` all government is in the free consent of the people '' . \nThey meant votes for all . \nOf course , universal suffrage does not guarantee any particular political result , and elections can not even ensure their own perpetuation - witness the Weimar Republic . \nElectoral democracy is also unlikely to produce outcomes convenient to hegemonic or imperial powers . \n-LRB- If the Iraq war had depended on the freely expressed consent of `` the world community '' , it would not have happened -RRB- . \nBut these uncertainties do not diminish its justified appeal . \nOther factors besides democracy 's popularity explain the dangerous belief that its propagation by armies might actually be feasible . \nGlobalisation suggests that human affairs are evolving toward a universal pattern . \nIf gas stations , iPods , and computer geeks are the same worldwide , why not political institutions ? \nThis view underrates the world 's complexity . \nThe relapse into bloodshed and anarchy that has occurred so visibly in much of the world has also made the idea of spreading a new order more attractive . \nThe Balkans seemed to show that areas of turmoil required the intervention , military if need be , of strong and stable states . \nIn the absence of effective international governance , some humanitarians are still ready to support a world order imposed by US power . \nBut one should always be suspicious when military powers claim to be doing weaker states favors by occupying them . \nAnother factor may be the most important : the US has been ready with the necessary combination of megalomania and messianism , derived from its revolutionary origins . \nToday 's US is unchallengeable in its techno-military supremacy , convinced of the superiority of its social system , and , since 1989 , no longer reminded - as even the greatest conquering empires always had been - that its material power has limits . \nLike President Wilson , today 's ideologues see a model society already at work in the US : a combination of law , liberal freedoms , competitive private enterprise and regular , contested elections with universal suffrage . \nAll that remains is to remake the world in the image of this `` free society '' . \nThis idea is dangerous whistling in the dark . \nAlthough great power action may have morally or politically desirable consequences , identifying with it is perilous because the logic and methods of state action are not those of universal rights . \nAll established states put their own interests first . \nIf they have the power , and the end is considered sufficiently vital , states justify the means of achieving it - particularly when they think God is on their side . \nBoth good and evil empires have produced the barbarisation of our era , to which the `` war against terror '' has now contributed . \nWhile threatening the integrity of universal values , the campaign to spread democracy will not succeed . \nThe 20th century demonstrated that states could not simply remake the world or abbreviate historical transformations . \nNor can they easily effect social change by transferring institutions across borders . \nThe conditions for effective democratic government are rare : an existing state enjoying legitimacy , consent and the ability to mediate conflicts between domestic groups . \nWithout such consensus , there is no single sovereign people and therefore no legitimacy for arithmetical majorities . \nWhen this consensus is absent , democracy has been suspended -LRB- as is the case in Northern Ireland -RRB- , the state has split -LRB- as in Czechoslovakia -RRB- , or society has descended into permanent civil war -LRB- as in Sri Lanka -RRB- . \n`` Spreading democracy '' aggravated ethnic conflict and produced the disintegration of states in multinational and multicommunal regions after both 1918 and 1989 . \nThe effort to spread standardised western democracy also suffers a fundamental paradox . \nA growing part of human life now occurs beyond the influence of voters - in transnational public and private entities that have no electorates . \nAnd electoral democracy can not function effectively outside political units such as nation-states . \nThe powerful states are therefore trying to spread a system that even they find inadequate to meet today 's challenges . \nEurope proves the point . \nA body such as the European Union could develop into a powerful and effective structure precisely because it has no electorate other than a small number of member governments . \nThe EU would be nowhere without its `` democratic deficit '' , and there can be no legitimacy for its parliament , for there is no `` European people '' . \nUnsurprisingly , problems arose as soon as the EU moved beyond negotiations between governments and became the subject of democratic campaigning in the member states . \nThe effort to spread democracy is also dangerous in a more indirect way : it conveys to those who do not enjoy this form of government the illusion that it actually governs those who do . \nWe now know something about how the actual decisions to go to war in Iraq were taken in at least two states of unquestionable democratic bona fides : the US and the UK . \nOther than creating complex problems of deceit and concealment , electoral democracy and representative assemblies had little to do with that process . \nDecisions were taken among small groups of people in private , not very different from the way they would have been taken in non-democratic countries . \nFortunately , media independence could not be so easily circumvented in the UK . \nBut it is not electoral democracy that necessarily ensures effective freedom of the press , citizen rights and an independent judiciary . \nEric Hobsbawm is professor emeritus of economic and social history of the University of London at Birkbeck and author of The Age of Extremes : The Short 20th Century 1914-1991 ; this is an edited version of an article that first appeared in the journal Foreign Policy ; this article has been republished from Le Monde diplomatique 's English language edition of December 2004 Le Monde diplomatique Letters for publication should be sent to : letters@guardian.co.uk If you need help using the site : userhelp@guardian.co.uk Call the main Guardian and Observer switchboard : . \n"}
{"id": "228", "time": "2005-01-22", "text": "Ian McEwan gives a global dimension to the details of a neurosurgeon 's day in Saturday , says Mark Lawson It 's odd now to think that Ian McEwan once lacked confidence as a novelist . \nHis first two attempts at the longer form - The Cement Garden and The Comfort of Strangers - felt like the work of a born short-story writer being stretched on a rack by his publisher and literary tradition , needing help from typeface and spacing to qualify even as novellas . \nBut with his last but one novel -LRB- Amsterdam -RRB- having won the Booker Prize and the last -LRB- Atonement -RRB- out-selling John Grisham and Tom Clancy in some weeks ' book charts , McEwan has the swagger - the literary equivalent of a tennis player in the first tournament after winning Wimbledon - of a novelist who could do almost anything . \nWhat he has done is Saturday , which resembles Amsterdam in sardonically examining the interior life of the contemporary middle classes but departs starkly from the century-long focus of Atonement by taking place over 24 hours , on what is supposed to be the day off of Henry Perowne , a noted London neurosurgeon . \nA recent edition of Granta carried an extract from Saturday , in which Perowne drives out of Oxford in the morning to visit his brain-hazed mother . \nI had assumed that this was the beginning of the novel but it turns out to be page 152 of a book of less than 300 pages . \nIt 's a measure of the level of incident in Henry 's day - and the meticulous close-stitching of McEwan 's work as a word-surgeon - that , before his Mercedes S500 reaches the Westway , en route to his mother , he has already witnessed a potential terrorist attack , discussed the Iraq war with his son , made love with his wife , come close to murder on a central London street , lost a game of squash and shopped for a fish stew . \nYet , while the novel is clearly an attempt to set down the textures of everyday life - close reading could improve your cooking , your squash game and even tip you off about what sort of kettle to buy - McEwan has larger concerns than , say , Nicholson Baker in the close auditing of The Mezzanine and Room Temperature . \nSaturday catalogues the local only in order to focus on the global . \nFor the day on which we take account of Henry is Saturday 15 February 2003 . \nAs the neuro-surgeon tries to mind his own business , hundreds of thousands of marchers are gathering in London to protest against Tony Blair 's support for the American attack on Iraq . \nAs the background tramping and shouting begins to intrude on the quiet order of Henry 's life , it becomes clear that , if Saturday were to have another eight-letter S-word as its title , it would be Security . \nBy recording with such loving care the elements of one rich Englishman 's life , Saturday explores the question of to what extent it is possible to insulate yourself against the world 's concerns . \nCentrally heated , pension-planned , air-bag protected , permanently loved and frequently fucked by his wife , healthy and even able to give health to others , Henry lives within a protective sac of satisfaction and achievement . \nBut , as Henry knows from his profession , such sacs are not always enough to protect against disastrous impact and , on this day of rest , he takes his hit . \nThe most recurrent theme in McEwan 's 10 novels is the sudden ambush of the safe and smug . \nGo shopping and you 'll never see your kid again -LRB- The Child in Time -RRB- . \nTake a hike and the hounds of hell are just around the corner -LRB- Black Dogs -RRB- . \nFall in love and the next thing you know you 're carving up a cadaver -LRB- The Innocent -RRB- . \nGo for a picnic and one man dies while a nutter claims you as his soul-mate -LRB- Enduring Love -RRB- . \nA similar external menace is pushing at Henry 's bubble . \nBetween his uxorious love-making and his squash game , he bumps into Baxter , an aggressive driver who believes that Henry should n't have been where he was . \nWe 'd think , colloquially , that Baxter needs his head seeing to and has a funny look . \nNeurosurgeon Perowne immediately understands the eruptions happening in the man 's skull . \nAs Saturday -LRB- like Enduring Love -RRB- is in part a story of suspense , a summary needs to be protective , but Baxter comes to challenge both the surgeon 's domestic instincts and his professional skills . \nBut Saturday , in common with Philip Roth 's The Plot Against America , is subtle enough to be taken as a warning against either intervention or against isolationism . \nIs the foreign policy of Henry 's government exposing him to danger , or is his moneyed , bouillabaisse-eating existence a self-delusion in a threatening world ? \nAs in the best political novels , the evidence and arguments are distributed with careful ambiguity . \nThe novel is inevitably and properly clearer about its position on another internal debate . \nPerowne , although an exemplar of the civilised upper middle classes , does n't believe in literature . \nHe has no time to read and even becomes confused when his daughter Daisy , about to have her first poems published by Faber & Faber , uses the tricky jargon word `` stanza '' . \nThe surgeon especially ca n't see the point of novels which tell you about someone 's life in great detail . \nSurely it 's quite easy to note these things down and then type them out . \nMcEwan gives Henry an even chance of victory on the squash court but , in this bit of sport about whether novels have a point , the novelist thrashes his hero in every line . \nIn giving his central character not only a poet daughter and a father-in-law who writes verse but a wife who works at a newspaper , the writer could be accused of locating the story on home turf . \nBut a considerable technical achievement of Saturday is that it succeeds in going inside the mind of a brain surgeon . \nIn the early stages , there is a certain nervousness about whether the author is simply transcribing research notes - `` Then he let Rodney take the lead in another burr hole for a chronic subdural '' - but , by the end , there is no doubt that Perowne has the hands , eyes and thoughts of a neurosurgeon rather than a novelist . \nMedical language , though , is only one of the registers in the prose . \nMcEwan is one of the least flashy stylists of his generation , less quotable than Martin Amis or Julian Barnes , but , especially in Atonement and now this book , his voice has settled into scrupulous , sensual rhythms in which even something as simple as a 24-hour news bulletin is subject to careful choices of adjective and noun : `` The synthesised bleeps , the sleepless anchor and his dependable jaw . '' \nIn a novel of great sureness at the level of both action and language , McEwan makes one curious choice : the quotations from Daisy Perowne 's debut volume of poetry are actually published lines by Craig Raine , giving the book an additional subplot in which , beyond the plot 's call on various sections of the Metropolitan police , you expect the literary cops to arrive and arrest Daisy for plagiarism . \nIt 's a matter of debate whether it 's the reader or the writer who is being too clever here . \nFor the rest of its length , though , Saturday gives no sense of McEwan 's talent taking a day off . \nThe only consolation for McEwan 's contemporaries , I suppose , is that they could taunt him that he ca n't seem to write short stories any more . \nMark Lawson 's Enough is Enough : Or the Emergency Government will be published by Picador later this year . \n"}

\nThe chancellor and foreign minister were not swayed . \nTo this day , they have stood by this responsible decision and at the same time shown themselves to be loyal to the role of the UN . \nIf the Stoiber-Merkel duo had won the last election , in 2002 , Germany and its soldiers would be embroiled in the war , suffering the consequences that the people of Iraq and every `` willing '' ally are enduring to this day . \nAngela Merkel still refuses to recognize her political misjudgment . \nTo vote her into federal office would be reckless . \nAnd who would take over Fischer 's responsibility for foreign policy ? \nA joker named Guido Westerwelle -LRB- from the Free Democratic party , the CDU 's coalition partner -RRB- , for example ? \nHere we already have a party that , seeking to favor high earners , has submitted to the dogmas of neoliberalism . \nWith lunatic plans for tax cuts it , along with the CDU , has cosied up to big business . \nOthers have made mistakes , and I do not want to minimize the misjudgments that chancellor Schrder 's government has made . \nPromises made by employers were believed for too long ; considerable income-tax cuts resulted only in demands for further cuts ; profits are being pocketed , not invested in new jobs ; directors of banks and major industries are giving themselves fraudulently high salaries and payoffs - while demanding , often using blackmail , that workers go without wage rises . \nThe permanent threat of job losses allows trade unions to be intimidated and the working population to be manipulated . \nThe Social Democrats and Greens have given in to such pressure too often - in a manner that is detrimental to democracy . \nHow will we get anywhere if groups outside parliament , such as the powerful pharmaceutical lobby , continue to influence legislation ? \nIf this continues , injustices will accumulate . \nLet us hope it is not too late for the current government to recognize that the financial consequences of its reforms should no longer favor only the very wealthy , but need to be for the good of all parts of society . \nThe FDP wants the highest rate of income tax to fall to 35 % . \nThen again , Paul Kirchhof , Frau Merkel 's wunderkind and her choice for finance minister , plans to outdo them with his neoliberal masterpiece of a 25 % flat-rate income tax for all . \nOne can only hope that as many people as possible will recognize this swindle before he gets near government . \nPlease do n't tell us that the big parties are all the same , and that there is no longer a left and a right . \nIt is the Social Democrats and the Green party that stood up for employees ' rights against the Christian Democrats ' neoliberal obsession with redundancy . \nIt is the Social Democrats that stood up for comprehensive schools . \nIt is the CDU and CSU , on the other hand , that are always attempting to block the way to educational justice . \nIt is the Greens ' admirably brave minister Renate Kunast who takes the farming lobby to task and is committed to protecting the consumer . \nIt is the Greens and Social Democrats who imposed a nuclear ban and promoted renewable energy , creating new jobs . \nIt is true that the initial move towards reform by the red-green coalition was full of mistakes . \nBut they had the desire to learn from their errors . \nAt the same time , the CDU made a point of badmouthing Germany , particularly from an economic standpoint . \nIn parliament 's upper house , the CDU has been blocking a multitude of reforms . \nIts conduct as an opposition party has taken on a destructive nature . \nThe only thing it is good at is complaining . \nOur country must not sink into self-pity nor lapse again into the stagnation of the Helmut Kohl era . \nMore courage is needed to make essential changes , even those that may hurt . \nThanks to new legislation , hundreds of thousands of foreign nationals have gained the possibility of German residency . \nThey are an asset to our country , because their cultures contribute to the color and variety of our society . \nOnly when their own cultures are respected will they be ready to recognize the enrichment they would get from the German culture and language . \nWith this we come again to Schrder and Fischer . \nBoth are capable of admitting mistakes and correcting them . \nBoth are occasionally criticised for their arrogance . \nThat 's all very well , but when one has drive and energy , and the other self-confidence , and both fearlessly handle the media , they deserve to survive . \nAfter all , it is thanks to their fierce determination that our soldiers escaped a war that was contrary to international law . \nTheir actions reinforced Germany 's reputation abroad . \nI will vote for the red-green alliance because it protected us from war ; had the courage to face difficult reforms ; is on the side of the socially disadvantaged ; and will save us from descending into a US-style class system . \nGnter Grass was awarded the Nobel prize for literature in 1999 ; a version of this article first appeared in the Sddeutsche Zeitung Letters for publication should be sent to : letters@guardian.co.uk If you need help using the site : userhelp@guardian.co.uk Call the main Guardian and Observer switchboard : G nter Grass : We must not be blackmailed by Merkel 's neoliberal gang This article appeared on p33 of the Main section section of the Guardian on 03.04 BST on Friday 16 September 2005 \n"}
{"id": "106", "time": "2005-09-16", "text": "Friday 16 September 2005 11.24 BST Like a boxer bigging himself up before a fight , George Galloway said that he was not in the slightest bit nervous about his forthcoming debate with Christopher Hitchens on whether the Iraq war was justified and necessary . \n`` He 's all washed up , like Sonny Liston , '' said the MP for Bethnal Green and Bow . \nBut in his prime even Liston had attributes that would make his opponents tremble . \n`` He was the big black Negro in every white man 's hallway , waiting to do him in , '' wrote Amiri Baraka in praise of Liston . \n`` A heavy-faced replica of every whipped-up woogie in the world ... finally here to collect his pound of flesh . '' \nAnd so it was -LRB- melanin content notwithstanding -RRB- that Hitchens , who supports the war , stood outside Baruch College , looking for a hallway to lurk in . \nWith just minutes to go he was still handing out leaflets denouncing Galloway . \n`` There 'll be no courtesies and no handshakes , '' said Hitchens , laying the ground rules for minimum civility . \nWhat had been billed as `` the grapple in the Big Apple '' in the end owed more to pugilism than polemics , with jibes , like jabs , missing more often than they landed , and many a blow below the belt . \nHitchens berated Galloway for his `` sinister piffle '' , congratulating him on `` being 100 % consistent in -LRB- his -RRB- support for thugs and criminals '' and declaring : `` The man 's search for a Fatherland knows no ends . '' \nGalloway branded Hitchens a hypocrite and `` a jester at the court of the Bourbon Bushes '' . \nDescribing Hitchens ' journey from the left to the right , Galloway said : `` What we have witnessed is something unique in natural history . \nIt 's the first metamorphosis of a butterfly back into a slug . '' \nIn the heat of battle the fact that butterflies come from caterpillars did not temper the applause from the audience , roughly two-thirds of whom backed Galloway . \nHaving both torched the moral high ground , they would both later claim it as their own . \nAt one point Galloway told Hitchens `` Your nose is growing , '' only to deride his opponent for his `` cheap demagoguery '' . \nHitchens scolded the jeering audience for their `` zoo-like noises '' , only to say that Galloway 's `` vile and cheap guttersnipe abuse is a disgrace '' . \nIn a debate that drew as much from the culture of the playground as the traditions of parliament , no hyperbolic stone was left unturned . \nIn response to one of Galloway 's answers Hitchens said : `` Beneath each gutter there 's another gutter gurgling away . '' \nGalloway later shot back : `` You 've fallen out of the gutter into the sewer . '' \nWhen they last met , just before Galloway testified before the Senate in May , he called Hitchens a `` drink-sodden former Trotskyist popinjay '' . \nHitchens replied `` You 're a real thug , are n't you ? '' \nFour months later , the level of debate did n't get much more sophisticated than that . \nIf the tone was emblematic of the divisive rancor that has made public discourse in general , and the Iraqi debate in particular , so uncivil , the venue was equally symbolic . \nFor when historians come to judge Wednesday 's event the first question they might ask is why in a city the size of New York , two British polemicists were needed to conduct it . \nThe `` sold out '' sign on the doors of Baruch College spoke volumes about the thirst for open public debate on the issue , and the rarity of home-grown voices who might quench it . \nFor a subject that is often discussed but seldom debated , the talent had to be imported . \nHitchens , who has lived in the US for some time and acquired dual citizenship , occasionally interchanged `` I '' for `` we '' - meaning Americans . \nBut this was a very British affair : the raucous knockabout of two men who both learned their craft at party conference fringe meetings , rather than setpiece primetime deliveries to televised party conventions . \nIf there was light amid all this heat it shone not from their well-rehearsed and familiar arguments , but from their mis-steps . \nGalloway learned the hard way that four years after the attacks on the twin towers there are still some things you can not say about September 11 that are common currency in Britain just a few months after the July 7 bombings . \n`` You may believe they came out of a clear blue sky , '' he said to a chorus of boos and single-finger gestures . \n`` But they came out of a swamp of hatred created by us . '' \nHitchens replied : `` You picked the wrong city to say that in , and the wrong month . '' \nBut it was Hitchens who made the greater gaffe when he implied , to howls of disbelief , that race played no part in those who perished in Hurricane Katrina , and that George Bush could not have helped the victims because he was obstructed by state officials . \nAt this point he might have taken his cue from Liston , who spat out his mouthpiece as the bell tolled for the seventh round against Muhammad Ali , declaring `` That 's it '' . \nBut he soldiered on . \nHaving lost the audience he then turned on them . \n`` I 'm just reminding you that you 're on telly , '' he said . \n`` I just hope your friends and relatives are n't watching . '' \nGalloway won on points . \nSadly , by the end of the night , few could remember what the point was . \n"}
{"id": "3", "time": "2005-11-22", "text": "Behind the phosphorus clouds are war crimes within war crimes We now know the US also used thermobaric weapons in its assault on Falluja , where up to 50,000 civilians remained The media could n't have made a bigger pig 's ear of the white phosphorus story . \nSo , before moving on to the new revelations from Falluja , I would like to try to clear up the old ones . \nThere is no hard evidence that white phosphorus was used against civilians . \nThe claim was made in a documentary broadcast on the Italian network RAI , called Falluja : the Hidden Massacre . \nIt claimed that the corpses in the pictures it ran `` showed strange injuries , some burnt to the bone , others with skin hanging from their flesh ... The faces have literally melted away , just like other parts of the body . \nThe clothes are strangely intact . '' \nThese assertions were supported by a human-rights advocate who , it said , possessed `` a biology degree '' . \nI , too , possess a biology degree , and I am as well qualified to determine someone 's cause of death as I am to perform open-heart surgery . \nSo I asked Chris Milroy , professor of forensic pathology at the University of Sheffield , to watch the film . \nHe reported that `` nothing indicates to me that the bodies have been burnt '' . \nThey had turned black and lost their skin `` through decomposition '' . \nWe do n't yet know how these people died . \nBut there is hard evidence that white phosphorus was deployed as a weapon against combatants in Falluja . \nAs this column revealed last Tuesday , US infantry officers confessed that they had used it to flush out insurgents . \nA Pentagon spokesman told the BBC that white phosphorus `` was used as an incendiary weapon against enemy combatants '' . \nHe claimed `` it is not a chemical weapon . \nThey are not outlawed or illegal . '' \nThis denial has been accepted by most of the mainstream media . \nUN conventions , the Times said , `` ban its use on civilian but not military targets '' . \nBut the word `` civilian '' does not occur in the chemical weapons convention . \nThe use of the toxic properties of a chemical as a weapon is illegal , whoever the target is . \nThe Pentagon argues that white phosphorus burns people , rather than poisoning them , and is covered only by the protocol on incendiary weapons , which the US has not signed . \nBut white phosphorus is both incendiary and toxic . \nThe gas it produces attacks the mucous membranes , the eyes and the lungs . \nAs Peter Kaiser of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons told the BBC last week : `` If ... the toxic properties of white phosphorus , the caustic properties , are specifically intended to be used as a weapon , that of course is prohibited , because ... any chemicals used against humans or animals that cause harm or death through the toxic properties of the chemical are considered chemical weapons . '' \nThe US army knows that its use as a weapon is illegal . \nIn the Battle Book , published by the US Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth , Kansas , my correspondent David Traynier found the following sentence : `` It is against the law of land warfare to employ WP against personnel targets . '' \nLast night the blogger Gabriele Zamparini found a declassified document from the US department of defense , dated April 1991 , and titled `` Possible use of phosphorus chemical '' . \n`` During the brutal crackdown that followed the Kurdish uprising , '' it alleges , `` Iraqi forces loyal to President Saddam may have possibly used white phosphorus -LRB- WP -RRB- chemical weapons against Kurdish rebels and the populace in Erbil ... and Dohuk provinces , Iraq . \nThe WP chemical was delivered by artillery rounds and helicopter gunships ... These reports of possible WP chemical weapon attacks spread quickly ... hundreds of thousands of Kurds fled from these two areas . '' \nThe Pentagon is in no doubt , in other words , that white phosphorus is an illegal chemical weapon . \nThe insurgents , of course , would be just as dead today if they were killed by other means . \nSo does it matter if chemical weapons were mixed with other munitions ? \nAnyone who has seen those photos of the lines of blind veterans at the remembrance services for the first world war will surely understand the point of international law , and the dangers of undermining it . \nBut we should n't forget that the use of chemical weapons was a war crime within a war crime within a war crime . \nBoth the invasion of Iraq and the assault on Falluja were illegal acts of aggression . \nBefore attacking the city , the marines stopped men `` of fighting age '' from leaving . \nMany women and children stayed : the Guardian 's correspondent estimated that between 30,000 and 50,000 civilians were left . \nThe marines treated Falluja as if its only inhabitants were fighters . \nThey levelled thousands of buildings , illegally denied access to the Iraqi Red Crescent and , according to the UN 's special rapporteur , used `` hunger and deprivation of water as a weapon of war against the civilian population '' . \nI have been reading accounts of the assault published in the Marine Corps Gazette . \nThe soldiers appear to have believed everything the US government told them . \nOne article claims that `` the absence of civilians meant the marines could employ blast weapons prior to entering houses that had become pillboxes , not homes '' . \nAnother said that `` there were less than 500 civilians remaining in the city '' . \nIt continued : `` The heroics -LRB- of the marines -RRB- will be the subject of many articles and books ... The real key to this tactical victory rested in the spirit of the warriors who courageously fought the battle . \nThey deserve all of the credit for liberating Falluja . '' \nBut buried in this hogwash is a grave revelation . \nAn assault weapon the marines were using had been armed with warheads containing `` about 35 % thermobaric novel explosive -LRB- NE -RRB- and 65 % standard high explosive '' . \nThey deployed it `` to cause the roof to collapse and crush the insurgents fortified inside interior rooms '' . \nIt was used repeatedly : `` The expenditure of explosives clearing houses was enormous . '' \nThe marines can scarcely deny that they know what these weapons do . \nAn article published in the Gazette in 2000 details the effects of their use by the Russians in Grozny . \nThermobaric , or `` fuel-air '' weapons , it says , form a cloud of volatile gases or finely powdered explosives . \n`` This cloud is then ignited and the subsequent fireball sears the surrounding area while consuming the oxygen in this area . \nThe lack of oxygen creates an enormous overpressure ... Personnel under the cloud are literally crushed to death . \nOutside the cloud area , the blast wave travels at some 3,000 metres per second ... As a result , a fuel-air explosive can have the effect of a tactical nuclear weapon without residual radiation ... Those personnel caught directly under the aerosol cloud will die from the flame or overpressure . \nFor those on the periphery of the strike , the injuries can be severe . \nBurns , broken bones , contusions from flying debris and blindness may result . \nFurther , the crushing injuries from the overpressure can create air embolism within blood vessels , concussions , multiple internal hemorrhages in the liver and spleen , collapsed lungs , rupture of the eardrums and displacement of the eyes from their sockets . '' \nIt is hard to see how you could use these weapons in Falluja without killing civilians . \nThis looks to me like a convincing explanation of the damage done to Falluja , a city in which between 30,000 and 50,000 civilians might have been taking refuge . \nIt could also explain the civilian casualties shown in the film . \nSo the question has now widened : is there any crime the coalition forces have not committed in Iraq ? \n"}

demobilised in September that year . \nHis specialist unit provided port operators and vessel crew . \nI left because my missus did n't want me to be in the TA any more . \nI was just doing a back-office job in Iraq , based mostly in Umm Qasr . \nI was n't doing a war-fighting role so I was n't in incredible danger . \nYou could have put a 19-year-old guy out of school doing it . \nI came back and stayed in the TA for two years . \nI eventually left because my wife did not want me to be mobilised again - but it was my decision to leave . \nAll the way down the line I have said family first , job second , reserves third . \nThe key thing for people who were in the early deployment is that TA families do n't have anywhere near the support that the regulars take for granted . \nShe did n't know anybody else who was in the same boat . \nRegular army wives all know each other and have a support network . \nAlso , I was losing # 500 a month . \nI was quite prepared to go to Iraq . \nI remain proud of the minimal contribution I made . \nThe only sour note has been that , two years down the line , I have yet to receive my medal . \nIn contrast , the TA unit based in Tony Blair 's constituency , who were deployed a year after us , were issued with their medals in a fine photo opportunity by the prime minister about a month after they returned . \nMr Eustis 's medal eventually arrived in the post last Thursday Gary Haran Doyle , 34 , from Earlsfield in London , was a Lance Corporal working as a mechanic in the TA . \nIn civilian life he is an investment banking consultant and earns # 200,000 a year . \nI joined the TA in 1988 when I was 17 , during the height of the `` red threat '' . \nI served in Bosnia on Operations Resolute and Lode Star -LRB- 1996-97 -RRB- . \nWhen Operation Telic came about I was firmly in the camp that felt taking out Saddam and imposing a democratic government was a good thing . \nI knew that 45-minute missile readiness was an exaggeration . \nBut I was n't called up for the invasion . \nI had the opportunity to volunteer or be called up later and I personally decided it was n't for me . \nAlthough I backed the government with its new foreign policy objective , I decided that somebody else could do it . \nI understand why the government has issues with paying high-earners . \nIf they were going to pay me # 100,000 for driving a truck I understand why they would have trouble justifying it . \nI do miss it . \nI would much rather spend a weekend running around with the lads in the TA once a month than being on the slopes in Austria which is what I do now . \nThe TA is much more rewarding , the opportunities to serve in an operational role are wonderful but because of the threat of being called up and having to go through the rigmarole of what you earn , I decided to leave . \nA sergeant major , 39 , who had been in the TA for more than 20 years and resigned after serving in Iraq . \nHe does not want to be identified because of his mental health problems . \nI was mobilised with just three days ' notice on Operation Telic 1 . \nI received the letter on the Tuesday and had to attend Chilwell -LRB- the TA training and mobilisation center in Nottingham -RRB- on the Friday . \nI came back from Iraq in July 2003 and due to a monumental cock-up in the army pay office in Glasgow , found that my ex-wife 's payments through the CSA had been collected by the army but were never paid to her . \nMy employers were instructed to take 85 % of my salary in deductions . \nI was left with # 280 a month to feed my girlfriend and young family . \nBy the time I got back from Iraq I was credit blacklisted . \nIt 's just gone from a bad situation to worse . \nI do n't think it 's a unique experience . \nFinancially , it 's been a nightmare . \nThen there was the training and kit aspect . \nMost people that went out there had cursory training . \nWhen we mobilised , supplies at Chilwell were short . \nThe war left me damaged in a number of ways . \nI came back in late July , just when David Kelly took his own life . \nPeople were then being very questioning about the military operation that I had just been on . \nI would be interested to see how a regular soldier coped with this type of thing . \nI bet he does n't have people in his work coming up and saying I bet you feel bad about being involved in that war . \nI boarded an aircraft at 1am in Basra , landed in the UK at 8.30 am British time and got chucked up to Chilwell . \nThe medical checking was a joke in terms of depleted uranium . \nBy 6pm they said , `` that 's it lads , you can go '' . \nWe had only had a 10-20 minute presentation on post-traumatic stress disorder at Basra airport . \nIt was given at 11.30 pm at night when we were absolutely fragged and had been through a real nightmare . \nI was sent home with no counselling or decompression talk . \nI eventually had a mental breakdown . \nI went to speak to my doctor because I was having great problems sleeping . \nIt took him six weeks to get hold of my medical records from the army . \nIn the end it was their opinion that I had PTSD . \nI was signed off for a course of counselling and spent a week in a psychiatric unit because I felt my head was going to explode . \nI was considering taking my own life . \nAnd while I am having the breakdown it is my civilian employer that is taking the hit . \nThe army has screwed me up and spat me out at the other end . \nA major , 39 , was a nurse in the regular army for three years before joining the TA . \nHe was mobilised for the Iraq war and left upon his return after six years ' service . \nSignificant numbers of TA medical personnel were mobilised in early February 2003 , including many from my unit . \nI was not and assumed I was not required . \nIt was a shock when about a month later my mobilisation papers arrived . \nI had to quickly make a will and ensure that money was not an issue . \nMy wife does not drive and we have no family within 200 miles and with her job and our small baby son to cope with it was going to be tough . \nHowever , I felt compelled to go . \nThe army has paid for me to go sailing and skiing and I saw this as payback time . \nI had , for all my personal misgivings about the war , a duty to the army and most especially as an army nurse , a duty to those soldiers fighting it . \nWe were told our training had been cut short as a result of our late mobilisation . \nI suspect the late mobilisations were a result of the government 's reluctance to be seen to be preparing for war . \nWe had no in-theatre training or any time to acclimatise to the desert . \nWe were dumped in a war at very short notice . \nNo desert kit was issued , though we did get body armor . \nWe should have had three Combopens which are used to combat the effects of nerve agents . \nThere were not enough to go around . \nThe canisters for our respirators were out of date . \nIn theater , casualty bags used in the event of a soldier not being able to wear his respirator were in desperately short supply . \nInstead of one per bed we had only two in the whole hospital . \nWe were 198 short . \nSome clinical equipment was also in short supply , such as urine bottles and hand soap . \nThe body armor issued in the UK had to be handed in to equip the frontline soldiers . \nIt seemed unbelievable that we had been sent to war because our enemy might have WMDs , yet our soldiers were under-equipped to defend themselves from that very threat . \nOnce the war was over , the two regular field hospitals were sent home before ours . \nThe effect on our morale was devastating and when I spoke to my wife on the phone she was so choked she could n't speak . \nI think it was at that point I knew my future in the TA was untenable . \nWhen I got home my wife was certainly pleased to see me but I knew she resented my absence and my son did not recognize me . \nIt hurt like hell . \nGeraint Hughes joined the TA `` out of curiosity '' in 1999 at 24 and was a Lance Corporal with the London Irish Rifles -LRB- the London Regiment -RRB- before requesting his discharge this year . \nHe volunteered to go to Iraq in March 2004 . \nMy task was to command a four-man team in Basra , and I 'm happy to say that all those I was responsible for -LRB- as well as the platoon as a whole -RRB- came back from Iraq alive . \nAfter we were demobilised in December 2004 I found adjusting to civilian life a little tricky , but now I 've become adjusted to civvy street . \nMy platoon still sticks together , its members stay in touch , and every now and again we meet up for a few beers and for memory 's sake . \nI have a lot of time for my former platoon buddies , and feel glad to have experienced the camaraderie that military veterans speak so much of . \nI left the TA in April this year , mainly because I finally managed to get myself a full-time lecturing post . \nThis meant moving to Swindon which made it impossible to train with the London Regiment . \nI could have joined a TA unit in Swindon - there 's a barracks 15 minutes walk from my flat - but I have decided to focus on my academic career . \nI have also , throughout my military career , only worn the headdress and cap-badge of the London Irish , and have no intention of joining another regiment . \nAs they say , once you have worn the caubeen -LRB- the Irish soldier 's headdress -RRB- no other hat fits . \nAlso , at 30 , I am no spring chicken , and the times when I could happily tab with a heavy bergen on my back , and a rifle in my hand , for kilometres on end has well and truly gone . \nI have absolutely no regrets about serving on Telic - in fact , I 'm pretty sure that I would have regretted not going . \nFor all the hard training , the separation from family and friends , the dangers and the days when I was tired , bored , hungry , hot and stressed , it was worth it . \nFor all the cock-ups in postwar reconstruction , and the blunders in Washington and London , I still think that the war was necessary , and that leaving Saddam unrestrained and in power would have had disastrous consequences for the Iraqi people , if not for the region as a whole . \nIn the end I felt that the work we did on the ground did help ordinary Iraqis . \n"}

'' \nThose on council estates are `` surrounded by the tattooed , with their pit bulls and serial partners , crack dens , joy-riders , open-all-hours pubs and the rest ... '' For their part , the police are dismissed as `` wooden , officious twerps in dayglo jackets '' who have sided with the yobs and given up on crime . \nOf single mothers , he wrote : `` It can not be long before Britain has its first 24-year-old granny . \nWhen you abolish husbands and fathers that is what you get . \nAs the rules of civilised life are swept away and the only people interested in getting married are lesbian clergywomen , there will soon be thousands of them . '' \nHitchens lays the blame squarely at the door of the `` permissive society '' . \n`` Like several governments before it , Labor has actively encouraged promiscuity by undermining marriage , promoting ` alternative lifestyles ' and preaching immorality in schools - and , of course , by continuing to subsidise the results . '' \nOther weeping Hitchens sores include : immigration , which is `` limitless '' and `` unmonitored '' ; New Labor - `` a horrible rabble of fakes , wreckers and frauds '' who are beyond the pale for `` dismantling Britain as a free country '' ; the Tories - invariably dismissed as `` the Useless party '' ; the EU - `` horrible '' , `` a monster '' and `` anti-British '' . \nAnd leftwing intellectuals - hell-bent on turning the UK into `` a meaningless , history-free and cultureless wilderness '' . \nHe may view himself as one of the last sane voices in an increasingly boisterous asylum , but there is little fire and brimstone about Hitchens in person . \nHe is friendly , if a touch gauche , courteous and dapperly dressed . \nWe sit at a small table in a smoky Italian cafe around the corner from Associated Newspapers ' Kensington offices . \nHis baritone voice booms over the clatter of crockery and the snorts of the espresso machine . \nPeople on nearby tables find themselves eavesdropping as they stir their cappuccinos . \nI am fascinated by his use of language , the `` pools of vomit '' , the `` pit bulls '' and the `` abolished '' fathers . \nDoes he really think that `` lesbian clergywomen '' are `` the only people interested in marriage '' ? \nHe replies : `` Caricaturists are among the finest artists because they alert you to the real characteristics of the people they draw . '' \nI try another one . \nIs Britain literally being `` dismantled '' ? \nIf you take the characteristics of the country as being a working system of law , institutions , morality , custom , that sort of invisible web of internalised beliefs and knowledge which makes it possible for society to function - then it is being very rapidly dismantled , yes . '' \nHitchens , 54 , is well aware that many on the left see him as a swivel-eyed obsessive and , to a certain extent , he revels in his enemy-of-the-chattering-classes persona . \nHe is , he proclaims , `` proud of his foes '' , even if over the years he has had to develop something of a thick skin . \n`` I know a lot of people consider me to be disreputable or foaming at the mouth , but you have to learn not to care , or at least not to mind . \nI do n't like being called ` bonkers ' and I think to some extent it demeans people who use phrases like that . \nBut I take comfort from the fact that most totalitarian regimes tend to classify their opponents as mentally disordered . '' \nHitchens ' political zealotry may be explained , in part , by his journey across the political landscape from former student agitator and `` Trot '' to doom-merchant rightwinger . \nHe reveals he was `` much further to the left '' than many of his contemporaries at York university in the early 1970s . \n`` I got my jabs against -LRB- being a Lefty -RRB- in a way that they did n't . \nI got the full raging contagion , they just got a mild version . \nI get asked tediously how come you 're on ` the right ' when you used to be on ` the left ' , to the extent that these categories mean anything . \nWhat is much more interesting is that so many people who were leftwing in their student years are still leftwing . \nWhy do n't middle-aged people who are at the height of their professions , well-off , paying large amounts of tax , generally part of the establishment , become Conservatives any more ? '' \nIt may be hard to picture now , but he continued to deliver `` small bundles of the Socialist Worker to embarrassed people who 'd filled in a form '' , throughout his first job as a reporter on the Swindon Advertiser . \nHowever , he concedes : `` By then I was having doubts about the project . \nI joined the Labor party in 1977 and remember campaigning for Ken Livingstone 's parliamentary candidature for Hampstead in 1979 - with some reluctance as I 'd not voted for his selection . \nBut I knew he would n't win . \nIt was fairly guilt-free . '' \nSoon afterwards , Hitchens became a political reporter at the Daily Express and thought it `` no longer appropriate to carry a party card '' . \nHis 24-year tenure at the Express , which included stints as correspondent in Moscow and Washington , came to an end soon after Richard Desmond took over the group . \nDesmond 's `` adult '' business interests prompted a bout of soul-searching in Hitchens , eventually leading him to quit for the Mail on Sunday . \nDoes he disapprove of Desmond ? \n`` I do disapprove of him . \nHow could I not ? \nIt would be ridiculous if I did n't . \nI met him once and to my great shame and regret I shook hands with him . \nGood manners , I 'm afraid , prevented me from refusing to shake his hand . '' \nAnother hand he has recently clasped belongs to his brother , Christopher , the Washington-based essayist and commentator . \nThey fell out after an unfathomable row over a joke about Stalinism . \nThey did not speak to each other for four years until they were reconciled publicly at a Guardian event at the Hay festival earlier this year . \nThey have exchanged no more than a `` couple of emails '' since . \n`` We were never particularly close , '' says Hitchens . \nIt has been suggested that there is a sense of rivalry between Christopher - the left-of-centre firebrand who famously backed the Iraq war , drawing the ire of many on the left who accused him of switching sides , and Peter - the moral conservative who speaks up for the silent , decent majority who cower behind their clipped hedges and memories of a better England . \nPeter 's slightly disingenuous response is that they are not in competition as they began in different journalistic fields . \n`` Christopher 's point of entry was commentary and essays . \nAnd I became a pundit by accident . \nI could always see it was an attractive billet . \nBut the process of becoming one was a series of accidents . '' \nUnlike his brother , Peter Hitchens was , and continues to be , a vociferous opponent of the Iraq war . \nHe never bought the WMD argument and felt `` his intelligence was being insulted '' by the Bush-Blair `` baby-talk '' . \nDid he admire his brother 's stance on Iraq - a position which has lost him many friends ? \nHitchens grudgingly concedes : `` Sure , any principled position is admirable even if it 's wrong . \nIt 's rigid positions taken for corrupt and disreputable reasons or because you are a coward which are to be scorned . '' \nIt is notable that he refuses to offer his brother so much as a whisper of defense over the George Galloway affair , despite the Respect MP describing Christopher as a `` slug '' leaving behind `` a trail of slime '' . \nHe says : `` I am not in that argument . \nThe great New York debate -LRB- in which the MP and the columnist recently clashed over the Iraq war -RRB- seemed to me to be about two positions I have nothing to do with . \nOne , if you support the war you are an imperialist , racist fascist . \nTwo , if you are against the war , you are a toady of dictators . \nI do n't think either holds any water . \nAs for Galloway , I 'll wait for the proof . \nHe is much alleged against but I 'm a believer in the presumption of innocence . '' \nHitchens believes the Tory party to be `` institutionally dead '' , frequently targeting the party for excoriation in his columns . \n`` The conventional wisdom is that Labor have stolen Tory policies , '' he says . \n`` The truth is over the past 50 years , the Tories have stolen Labor policies . \nThe Tory party has never fought a single battle . \nIt did n't fight for marriage , for grammar schools or a proper criminal justice system . \nIn fact you will find many of the worst reforms of the criminal justice system were put in place by Conservative governments . \nAnd it fell victim to the belief that the market could replace morality or Christianity . '' \nUnsurprisingly , he is no fan of leadership hopeful David Cameron either . \n`` All he wants to do is be like Labor . \nHe just wants ministerial cars . '' \nWhat does he make of the drugs row that has dogged Cameron 's campaign ? \n`` What matters is not whether someone has taken drugs , but what their attitude is subsequently . \nI do n't know whether Cameron has or not . \nBut if he did -LRB- take drugs -RRB- and then said ' I strongly disapprove of it and it was a seriously wrong thing to do ' , then I would n't care if he 'd taken drugs . '' \nA question pops into my head . \n`` Have you ever taken drugs ? '' \n`` Yes '' , he replies , refusing to elaborate . \nRichard Littlejohn said that the true job of the columnist is to chuck beer bottles from the back of the room at those in authority . \nFor Hitchens it is rather more than that . \n`` There is a part of the tradition of liberty which requires hecklers , but if that were all it was it would n't really be enough . \nThe main thing I want to do is to introduce ideas into the public discourse which then people who are deemed to be respectable can take up in a slightly quieter fashion . '' \nThen the writer , who was once told to `` Sit down and stop being bad ! '' \nby Blair , adds : `` But then again hitting the prime minister in the face with a ripe tomato from time to time is good for liberty .

{"id": "314", "time": "2005-11-14", "text": "This picture from Jordanian state-run TV shows Sajida al-Rishawi confessing to her failed attempt to set off an explosives belt inside one of the three Amman hotels . \nPhotograph : Marco di Lauro\\/Getty In her black coat and white headscarf , Sajida al-Rishawi looked like many other Arab women . \nBut the shapeless garment made it easy for her to conceal a belt of explosives and a belt of ball bearings - and her mission , along with her husband , to blow up a hotel full of wedding guests . \nAppearing on Jordanian television last night the woman , 35 , described how she had traveled from Iraq to Jordan to play her part in last Wednesday 's triple suicide attack on three Amman hotels that left 57 dead and more than 90 wounded . \nWearing the disarmed explosive belt over her coat , she turned around as if modelling it and demonstrated how she had planned to pull the red cord that would have detonated the explosives . \nOnce her belt had failed to detonate as she stood among a crowd of wedding guests , however , she fled to an apartment in Amman , where she was arrested yesterday morning . \nWringing her hands but sounding calm and confident , she described to an interviewer on live television how she and her husband , Ali Hussein Shamari , had traveled from Iraq to the Jordanian capital . \nThere they rented an apartment and her husband taught her how to use the bomb . \n`` He said it was for the attack on hotels in Jordan , '' she said . \n`` We rented a car and entered the hotel on November 5 . \nMy husband and I went inside and he went to one corner and I went to another . \n`` There was a wedding at the hotel with children , women and men inside . \nMy husband detonated -LRB- his bomb -RRB- and I tried to explode my belt but it would n't . \nPeople fled running and I left running with them , '' she said . \nAt a press conference earlier in the day , Marwan Muasher , the deputy prime minister of Jordan , said that when the husband noticed his wife was having trouble detonating her bomb by pulling its primer cord , he `` pushed her out of the ballroom '' . \n`` Once she was out , he blew himself up , '' he told reporters . \nThe bomb strapped to the man 's body was packed with the powerful explosive RDX and ball bearings , and was designed to kill many people . \nIf his wife had succeeded in her attempt , the carnage would have been much worse . \nShamari killed the majority of the 57 bombing victims at the Radisson hotel . \nAll were Jordanians or Palestinians . \nThe fathers of the bride and groom were killed and the mother of the bride is in a coma . \nAlthough those holding their hands were killed , the married couple escaped unhurt . \nMr Muasher said the three successful suicide bombers who attacked the Grand Hyatt , Radisson and Days Inn hotels were Iraqis from Anbar , the Iraqi province bordering Jordan . \nThey were named as Shamari , 35 ; Rawad Jassem Mohammed Abed , 23 ; and Safaa Mohammed Ali , 23 . \nMs Rishawi was identified as the sister of Mubarak Atrous al-Rishawi , a leader of al-Qaida in Iraq in Anbar province . \nHe was believed to have been killed by US forces in Falluja last year . \nHe was reported to have been the deputy of Abu Musab Zarqawi , the Jordanian-born leader of al-Qaida in Iraq who has been sentenced to death in absentia by a Jordanian court . \nThe four bombers drove into Jordan from Iraq on November 4 , five days before the attacks , and rented an apartment in western Amman . \nThey left their apartment on Wednesday and took taxis to the hotels , including the Radisson , where almost 300 people were attending a wedding reception in one of the hotel 's ballrooms . \nMr Muasher said : `` It is clear from the way she was dressed and the explosive belts with ball bearings that they wanted to target innocent civilians , and also wanted to inflict the biggest number of casualties and victims . '' \nThe arrest of Ms Rishawi appears to confirm the authenticity of a series of statements posted on the internet by al-Qaida in Iraq . \nThe group said it had sent four Iraqis , including a husband and wife , to carry out the bombings but Jordanian police said they found the bodies of only three male bombers . \nThe al-Qaida statements attempted to justify the attacks on the hotels because they were frequented by prostitutes , spies and `` apostates '' . \nKing Abdullah II of Jordan told American television that the Iraqis had deliberately tried to kill Jordanians rather than westerners . \n`` This was nothing to do with the west . \nThis targeted Jordanian citizens - innocent men , women and children , '' he said . \n`` The majority of the country poured out to denounce what Zarqawi and al-Qaida did , calling for Zarqawi to be brought to justice , for him to burn in hell . '' \nHe said that Jordan was `` suffering from the effects '' of the US-led Iraq war , `` but we are all hoping , I think as is everybody in the world , that at the end of the day Iraq will be part of the international community '' . \nAmman 's western hotels are populated by guests from all over the world . \nMost are engaged in work in Jordan and Iraq . \nHowever , Jordanians regularly use the banqueting rooms , restaurants , health clubs and lobbies for business and personal reasons . \n"}
{"id": "75", "time": "2005-09-18", "text": "New Yorkers queued around the block to see two British political heavyweights - writer Christopher Hitchens and MP George Galloway - square up over the war in Iraq . \nAndrew Anthony flew to america to take them both on ... Outside the Mason Hall in Gramercy Park , Manhattan , a long line of people stretched around the block as they queued for the sold-out showdown between Christopher Hitchens , the English journalist and essayist domiciled in America , and George Galloway , the Respect MP for Bethnal Green and Bow . \nBilled as the Grapple in the Big Apple , this two-Brit debate on the Iraq war had galvanised and divided New York 's political classes in a manner that perhaps no native orators could achieve . \nFor fans of a certain kind of muscular polemic , Hitchens v Galloway was the equivalent of an historic heavyweight prize fight . \nIndeed , so oversubscribed was the event that some were suggesting , not entirely in jest , that it should have been moved to Madison Square Garden , scene of countless boxing epics . \nAs it was , in the more claustrophobic setting of a community college , tempers were running high . \n` This country is the most evil empire the world has ever known , ' announced Bill Mann , a short stocky man with a flat nose and a Brooklyn accent that made Tony Curtis sound like Gregory Peck . \nMann informed me with unshakeable confidence that there would not be a single Hitchens supporter in the audience . ' \nI support Hitchens , ' said David Katz , a rather lugubrious-looking character standing directly behind Mann . \nSuddenly a street-corner argument was served up like an undercard bout before the main event . \nMann presented his thesis that America had killed more people than any other nation and that the Soviet Union liberated Europe . \n` Yeah , tell that to the Poles , and the Czechs and the Romanians , ' said Katz , as he defended America 's global record on fighting for freedom . \nKatz 's speech did not go down well with the crowd and one woman , who told me that she was a ` progressive egalitarian humanist ' , became so exasperated that she stormed off . \n` It 's OK , ' explained Katz , ` that 's my wife . ' \nFurther along , dressed in black and hobbling on crutches , was a man named Roy Rollin who said that he was a ` far-left Trotskyite ' backing Galloway . \nHe looked like Richard III and spoke like Rick from The Young Ones . \n` Hitchens has sold his soul to the imperial bourgeoisie to ingratiate himself into the ruling class of America , ' he said . \nThese days you would have to rent out an early Woody Allen comedy if you wanted to hear an American employ this kind of language , but Rollin was not joking . \nNor was anyone else . \nThe sense that the proceedings were something of a throwback to a more revolutionary era became impossible to ignore when Hitchens turned up and began distributing leaflets to the crowd . \nThey listed Galloway 's various statements and political positions down the years , most of which were news to those gathered . \nTo them Galloway was a plain-speaking Scot who had socked it to a Senate committee back in May . \nSome were surprised to read that he had saluted Saddam Hussein and praised other Middle East dictators like Syria 's Bashar al-Assad . \nNevertheless , Hitchens was met with a volley of abuse , much of it from Rollin , though nothing like what was to come . \nTeetering on the elegant side of dishevelled , Hitchens cut a defiant figure shuffling along the line . \n` Have you got the sheet on fascism ? ' \nhe asked , as he proffered another leaflet . \nA veteran of these kinds of meetings , he seemed to relish the contest . \nIn years gone by when he was a columnist with the Nation -LRB- the voice of the American dissenting left -RRB- , he was feted by the very people who were now calling him ` disgusting ' , ` an opportunistic whore ' , and other less complimentary terms . \nNowadays he is denounced by metropolitan radicals as a turncoat . \nFirst for backing the invasion of Afghanistan , following the 9\\/11 attacks , and then , more controversially , for endorsing the invasion of Iraq and the toppling of Saddam Hussein in 2003 . \nYet buried beneath the accusations and counter accusations , the sense of fringe politics betrayal and disloyalty , this dispute in a college hall also pointed to the heart of much larger issues such as anti-imperialism and principled intervention , totalitarianism and democracy , jihadi terrorism and American militarism . \nThus it was a kind of theatrical representation of the disagreements that are currently reshaping , splitting and even destroying what was once known as the Left . \nTo get a clearer picture of this fracture , I wanted to speak to Hitchens and Galloway before their clash . \nI wanted to visit their respective training camps and discuss at length their opposing outlooks away from the heated atmosphere of the ring - excuse me , stage . \nFirst I planned to travel to Portugal to see Galloway in his infamous holiday home . \nThen I would go to Washington , where Hitchens now makes a comfortable living as one of the most prolific and gifted political writers in the business . \nEverything seemed set until I made a cardinal error . \nJust a week before the interview with Galloway , I wrote a column that questioned his views on the relationship between free speech and religion . \nAt the Edinburgh festival , he had warned in a discussion on a television adaptation of The Satanic Verses that anyone who offended religious beliefs should be aware that they would suffer ` blowback ' . \n` You should do it very carefully , ' he cautioned . \nAs the comment was addressed to a panel that included Salman Rushdie , who knew all about ` blowback ' , it might have been construed as indelicate or even threatening . \nI wondered in print how Galloway could appear to be so sensitive to the issue of faith while at the same time lamenting the collapse of the Soviet Union -LRB- what he called the ` biggest catastrophe of my life ' -RRB- , an atheist state in which many people had been imprisoned for 25 years in slave labor camps for the crime of praying . \nBut it seems that Galloway , the tough former boxer from Dundee , can take most things in his stride , except criticism . \nThe interview was off . ' \nI do n't want to talk to you , ' he told me on the phone , ` and that 's it . ' \nThis was a shame . \nI was looking forward to Portugal , and had already mentally packed my swimming trunks . \nWith the possible exception of Robert Kilroy-Silk , a man with whom he has a number of uncanny similarities , Galloway is the most deeply tanned politician ever to step foot in Parliament . \nMy guess was that we would have had our chat poolside . \nIt might not have ranked alongside Galloway 's midnights swims with Fidel Castro in Cuba , but it would have been a welcome break from what we workers refer to as the struggle . \nThere were also some questions I wanted to put to him . \nFor instance , if he is so firmly committed to anti-imperialism that in any battle between North Korea , Kim Jong-Il 's slave state , and the United States he has said that he would side with North Korea , why did he appear to support the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan , a war that is estimated to have killed as many as 1.5 million people and also inspired a generation of jihadis ? \nHow could Galloway denounce Arab dictatorships yet toady up to Saddam in 1994 , when he was well aware of his endless crimes . ' \nI thought the President would appreciate to know , ' he told the dictator to his face , ` that even today , three years after the war , I still meet families who are calling their new-born sons Saddam . \nI salute your courage , your strength , your indefatigability . ' \nHow could he go to Syria and announce that the country was ` lucky to have Bashar al-Assad as her president ' when its people had no say in the matter . \nAnd was there any level of terrorist barbarity in Iraq and elsewhere that he would condemn , or was everything acceptable in the war against Western capitalism and democracy ? \nThe answers would have to wait . \nStill , I hoped to talk to him in New York before or after the debate . \nIn the meantime I flew to Washington DC to put another set of questions to Hitchens . \nGiven that neither Hitchens nor Galloway are men who recoil from the sound of their own voice , and both have a persuasive talent with words , it would be a challenge to invent two more contrasting personalities . \nHitchens is a former public schoolboy who went to Oxford , while Galloway attended grammar school in Dundee and graduated with honors from the uncompromising study that is the Scottish Labor Party . \nBoth were drawn to the far left , Hitchens to the Trotskyist International Socialists , which he soon quit , and Galloway to what was effectively the Stalinist wing of the Labor movement . \nHe is careful not to praise Stalin the man but rather his achievements in ` industrialising ' the Soviet Union - a process that led , of course , to millions of deaths . \nBut perhaps their most commented-upon difference is that Galloway is a teetotaller , while Hitchens , to put it at its mildest , is not . \nI met up with Hitchens at a Georgetown restaurant after a White House party thrown for President Talabani of Iraq . \nHe was with a number of Washington wonks and Kurdish supporters , and also Ann Clwyd , Tony Blair 's special envoy on human rights to Iraq . \nClwyd had known Talabani since his days as a Kurdish resistance leader fighting Saddam . \nShe could recall visiting him in the mountains when the idea that he would become president seemed so fanciful as to be absurd . \nWhat she could not recall was the anti-Saddam activism that Galloway insists he once took part in . \nThe Respect MP claims that he was a staunch opponent of Saddam , only supporting his cause after Iraq invaded Kuwait and thereby made an enemy of the US . \nIn that first Gulf War , Hitchens , too , took Iraq 's side against the US-led coalition . \n` At the time I would freely admit I really hated Bush senior , ' he told me . \n` But I quite soon began to feel like a dog being washed . \nI did know about the nature of the Saddam regime because I 'd already been in Iraq . \nI had no excuse not to know . \nI suppose I have to plead guilty to thinking of Kuwait as a royal family rather than a nation , but I knew better . \nI was fatally irresolute about this . ' \nIt was a visit to Kurdistan , where he saw that Bush Snr was viewed as a hero , that changed his mind . \nFor a long time he had thought that unless the Americans created a Palestinian homeland they had no business in the Middle East . ' \nI still do believe in the establishment of a Palestinian homeland but I no longer think that everything else has to be postponed . ' \nIt 's this kind of analysis that has led many of his former allies to dismiss him as a neo-conservative . \n` No , ' he states , ` I 'm not any kind of conservative . ' \nAll the same , he admires the neo-cons ' willingness to confront the status quo . \n` One heard people who claimed to have radical credentials say that the removal of Saddam would destabilise the Middle East . \nWell excuse me comrades , you like it the way it is ? \nDestabilisation is now a bad word ? ' \nOf course , many people surveying the instability of Iraq today do indeed question the wisdom of the intervention . \nIn a perceptive essay he wrote on Churchill , Hitchens suggested a few years ago that the British wartime leader was too committed to war ` to turn back without risking ridicule or obloquy ' . \nI asked him if he ever felt aware of the same risk . \n` There is no analogy to the Churchill position , ' he replies . \n` What would it take for me to desert -LRB- the Iraqi secular and democratic forces -RRB- ? \nWell nothing , there is no way . \nIt 's like saying , `` Oh I could n't very well be your friend after you 'd gone broke and been mugged , and after that burglary at your home . '' ' \nNor is he any more tolerant of the argument that Iraq is another Vietnam . \n` There were no fascists against the Vietnam war but every fascist group is against the war in Iraq . \nI was not against the Vietnam war ; I was pro-the Vietnamese revolution . \nAnd I would be the same today . \nGalloway is not anti-war . \nHe 's pro-war on the other side . \nHe 's gone to all the trouble to make that clear and in a way I admire that . \nI think he is hypocritical insofar as he does n't always say the things in London that he says in the Middle East . ' \nHitchens says that he no longer has any political allegiances , and something he mentioned just before we parted - after a 4am finish at his downtown apartment - seemed to point to where the chasm had opened up between himself and his opponents . \n` It 's not really an argument about the facts of the matter . \nIt 's an argument about the mentality . ' \nWhatever patience or sympathy he once had with the outlook that sees the West only as the problem and never the solution had been exhausted . \nHis side and Galloway 's side were separated by fundamentally opposing perceptions of reality that could not be bridged by means of reason . \nIt did not bode well for the debate . \nIn New York I introduced myself to Galloway before the hostilities were under way . \nHe smiled and said hello then turned and walked away . \nI was beginning to accept that he was not going to talk to me . \nThe event had been arranged as part of his American book tour , promoting Mr Galloway Goes to Washington . \nTomorrow in Chicago he is speaking with Jane Fonda , a partnership that was organised , much to Hitchens 's amusement , by Eve Ensler , author of The Vagina Monologues At last Hitchens and Galloway took their positions at podiums on either side of the stage , neither looking at the other . \nAmong the audience was Oona King , the former Labor MP defeated by Galloway in Bethnal Green . \nIn his beard and open-necked casual blue shirt , the Englishman resembled the part-time college lecturer that he in fact is . \nGalloway , by fastidious contrast , was wearing a beige suit with a carefully co-ordinated tie , his bronze pate shining under the stage lights . \nHitchens began his proposal - ` the war in Iraq is just and necessary ' - by calling for a minute 's silence for the 160 Iraqis murdered that morning in Baghdad by al-Qaeda . \nThere were instant boos and hails of protest from some members of the audience . \nIn July in Syria Galloway had given a speech celebrating the ' 145 military operations every day ' made by ` these poor Iraqis - ragged people with their sandals and their Kalashnikovs ... ' But the Iraqis killed on Wednesday were poor labourers looking for work and they were blown apart by sophisticated explosives . \nIt was not clear to me at least why they were unworthy of a minute 's silence . \nIn many ways , the level of debate never recovered from this indecency . \nBoth speakers accused one another of sinking to the gutter and both made direct attacks on the other , though it was Galloway who was perhaps the more personal . \nSeeking to trump the ` drink-sodden former Trotskyist popinjay ' remark with which he had bested Hitchens outside the Senate committee meeting back in May , he reflected on his earlier admiration for the writer . \nHe had gone on to make natural history , said Galloway , ` by metamorphosing from a butterfly into a slug ' . \nAfter that he then accused Hitchens of being ` ready to fight to the last drop of other people 's blood ' . \nThese were prepared insults that may have pleased a section of the crowd but said nothing about the situation in Iraq today , much less the situation under Saddam . \nBut the cheers that they elicited appeared to lift Galloway , or at least the volume of his voice , till he reached a pitch of finger-waving declamation that was both comical and a little frightening to behold . \nEven the moderator , the less than neutral anti-war broadcaster , Amy Goodman , was moved to ask Galloway to place the microphone further away from his mouth . \nBut it was to no avail . \n` You did write like an angel , ' Galloway screamed at Hitchens , ` and now you are working for the devil . \nDamn you and damn all your words . ' \nAt one of the more surreal moments in the evening , Galloway , his tan reddening as the veins in his neck did battle with his tie , accused Hitchens of ` cheap demagoguery ' . \nThe ` popinjay ' may have his faults , but demagoguery is not his style . \nInstead he prefers a more urbane approach of teasing out ironies and inconsistencies . \nHow , he wondered , after Galloway had invoked Cindy Sheehan , the antiwar protesting mother of a slain soldier , could he go to Syria and praise the murderers of the son then come here and offer support for the mother . \nYet Hitchens allowed much of the goodwill he built up to dissipate when he refused to blame George Bush for the debacle in New Orleans , and resisted the idea that racism played a part in the plight of the abandoned citizens of the Gulf coast . \nIt seemed almost as if he had it with the bien pensants of the left and wanted to get at them any way that he could . \nAs the debate drew to a close , both speakers were eager to finish . \nLike two fighters who had no more punches to throw , they were waiting for the bell . \nOpinion was divided over who triumphed , though from where I sat Hitchens won on points . \nAmerica may see itself as the home of democracy , but there was no vote . \nSo it was left to the market to decide . \nA post-event book signing was convened and it was noticeable that the queue was almost twice as long to see Hitchens . \nIn the end the evening served to confirm much of what we already knew : Galloway will ally himself with anyone , no matter what their politics , against what he calls the ` two biggest rogue states in the world ' , America and Britain . \nAnd Hitchens has developed a steely contempt for the defeatism of his former friends . \n` This is masochism , ' he told the audience , ` but it 's being offered to you by a sadist . ' \nAfterwards Amy Goodman told me that in the US it was hard ` to get a debate in which two people disagreed with each other ' . \nI 'm not sure that that 's true , though it might be that to get two people who disagree with each other as much as Hitchens and Galloway you have to look to Britain , which has a more rumbustious tradition in these matters . \nIn any case , the two sides of what was once the left - the interventionists and the anti-imperialists - have seldom seemed so far apart , nor Iraq so far away . \n"}
{"id": "204", "time": "2005-09-18", "text": "Al-Qaeda 's slaughter has one aim : civil war 150 died in one day in Baghdad - and Iraqis , not foreign fighters , are now the insurgency 's keenest recruits . \nPeter Beaumont investigates how this crucial shift has changed the fight The unemployed gather like blown drifts where jobs are to be had . \nThey queue around the block in weary , patient lines at barracks and police stations , clutching their identity papers . \nThey queue to dig ditches or shovel rubbish from the streets , or gather in the early morning in dusty streets and squares where builders tout for labourers . \nLast week the bombers came to al-Uruba Square in Kadhimiya , a Shia area of Baghdad . \nWith its vast , important , gold-domed mosque , it has been a favorite for the suicide bombers . \nOn Wednesday the driver of a van , pretending to seek day labourers , called men to his vehicle . \nAs they approached , he detonated 220 kilos of high explosives , killing 114 people and injuring 150 more . \nThis was the beginning of one of Iraq 's bloodiest days , but , despite the carnage , far from its most murderous . \nIn a series of bomb explosions and shootings , 150 people would lose their lives and 500 would be injured . \nIt was followed by yesterday 's toll of 30 people killed and 38 wounded in a car bombing in Nahrwan , around 30 miles from Baghdad . \nEarlier in the day police in Baghdad found nine bodies shot in the head and chest in three separate incidents , while in Baquba one man died and 17 people , including three Iraqi soldiers , were wounded when a car driven by a suicide bomber exploded near an Iraqi army patrol . \nAs officials of Iraq 's Shia-dominated government , including those at the overworked Institute of Forensic Medicine , study the aftermath of the latest bombings , it is with a new fear : that they will find the bomber was not a Syrian , Yemeni , Saudi or even a Briton , but a brother Iraqi recruited by al-Qaeda . \nA year ago analysis of the identities of suicide bombers deployed by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi 's al-Qaeda in Iraq suggested the vast majority of suicide volunteers were foreign fighters smuggled across the Syrian border . \nA year on , the government , and its multinational allies , are confronting a shocking new reality : an emboldened and reinvigorated al-Qaeda that for the first time is attracting increasingly large numbers of young Iraqi Sunnis to its cause - and to die in suicide operations . \nFollowing a week in which Zarqawi ` declared total war ' on the country 's Shia majority after the co-ordinated series of attacks that began in Kadhimiya , British and American officials have admitted that there is growing evidence that al-Qaeda is strengthening its grip in Iraq . \nIn the most alarming development , officials concede that for the first time that a significant number of suicide attacks in the country are now being undertaken by Iraqis . \nThe recruitment of Iraqi suicide bombers by al-Qaeda comes at a time when Iraqi Sunnis also appear to be taking increasingly senior roles in al-Qaeda in their country , and at a time that the leadership and aims of the wider insurgency have become increasingly blurred . \nSome American officials have claimed that as much as half of Zarqawi 's organization is now Iraqi , but their British counterparts are more careful , admitting only that they are alarmed by the number of Iraqis volunteering to carry out suicide operations . \n` Everything points to the fact that Iraq has become the main point of effort for al - Qaeda now , ' said one British official . \n` There is evidence that al-Qaeda globally is sending human and financial resources to support the struggle in Iraq . ' \nWhat is not clear is the nature of the links between al-Qaeda 's current poster boy for international jihad and senior members of Osama bin Laden 's operation , and what role they are playing in the organization in Iraq , although some officials strongly suspect that they are involved . \nWhat has emerged is that al-Qaeda in Iraq has three explicit targets : to hurt the US and Britain on the ground ; to attack democracy ; and to attack Shias , whom they regard as schismatic apostates . \n` There is a feeling in al - Qaeda that Iraq is the springboard for their wider ambitions , ' said the official . \n` To that end they have upped their game in Iraq significantly in the last 12 months . ' \nThat view is endorsed by a US official who told the Los Angeles Times last week : ` They are the best game in town , the most organised organization . ' \nWhat is doubly worrying for the US and Iraq is evidence that , where once even many Sunnis who actively supported the wider insurgency still regarded al-Qaeda and its tactics as deeply unpalatable , now - despite rejecting al-Qaeda 's vision of a return to a medieval caliphate - they are more willing to accept Zarqawi 's methods as a valid weapon in their struggle . \nThe emerging picture of al-Qaeda and its operations is increasingly alarming Washington , London and Baghdad . \nAlthough few feel safe estimating the size of Zarqawi 's network , one places the hardcore of the organization as around 10 per cent of the total of Iraq 's insurgency , itself thought to command upwards of 20,000 committed fighters . \nBy this account , Zarqawi 's organization would be between 1,000 and 2,000 in total , not including the suicide bombers who pass through its hands . \nAt the head of the Iraq organization is Zarqawi and a series of key aides who co-ordinate strategy and logistics . \nBeyond this small , central group are locally com - manded al-Qaeda groups in major cities and areas of activity which are under the command of individual 'em irs ' . \nAccording to officials , each of these emirs , who are in charge of operations , logistics , finance and planning , is paired with a propaganda chief in charge of communicating al-Qaeda 's recruitment message to the local organizations . \n` Zarqawi 's organization is the most secretive operating in Iraq , and probably the best , ' said one British official . \n` For that reason , it has probably always looked bigger than it is . ' \nYet the existence of such an effective terrorist organization , even if it is just a small part of the insurgency , has created another paradox that Western military and intelligence officials are grappling with : the willingness of Iraqis to fight where al-Qaeda is under assault . \nIn Falluja , 40 miles west of Baghdad , and the northern city of Tal Afar ` what has been extraordinary on both occasions is the number of people who picked up weapons ' , said one official . \n` The orthodoxy had been to expect more resistance from the foreign fighters . ' \nOne explanation for al-Qaeda 's new appeal to Iraqi fighters is supplied by Mowaffak Rubaie , Iraq 's national security adviser and a former Shia activist , who said last week that ` there 's no doubt ' that once-nationalistic elements of the insurgency were now drifting toward Zarqawi . \n` There 's a tendency to religionise the insurgency , ' he said . \n` Religion is a strong motive . \nYou 're not going to find someone who 's going to die for Baathists . ' \nIt is not only the apparent resilience of al-Qaeda in Iraq as an organization and its ability to replenish itself after setbacks that is worrying military and intelligence officials : the organization 's ability to refresh the ranks of its volunteers for suicide operations is also causing alarm . \n` What is striking , ' said one Whitehall analyst , ` is that a year ago al-Qaeda would have extravaganzas and then run out of suicide bombers , so there would be a lull . \nWe had 11 on a single day last week . ' \nIraqi and Western officials are not the only ones who are waking up to the new potential of al-Qaeda in Iraq . \nAfter two years and more of ignoring the problem , Iraq 's neighbors are now taking an urgent interest in the group 's ability to flourish , conscious that , after Iraq , their own regimes are in the crosshairs . \nIf last week 's bombings were designed to deliver one message - the provocation of the Shias into a broadening civil conflict - Zarqawi 's declaration of total war , broadcast by al-Qaeda 's ` Jihad Media Battalion ' on the internet , had a different audience in mind . \nThat audience was potential recruits , urging them to abandon moderate Sunni clerics in favor of al-Qaeda 's apocalyptic agenda . \nDescribing the joint US-Iraqi assault on Tal Afar , Zarqawi sought to cast the Sunnis as victims of a vicious sectarian war . \n` Sunnis who managed to escape from the hell of the crusader bombing , ' claimed Zarqawi , ` were seized by the treacherous hands of the treacherous -LRB- Badr -RRB- corps and others , who abused and murdered the men and who desecrated the women 's honor and stole their jewellery and ornaments . \n` This is an organised sectarian war , whose details were carefully planned , against the will of those whose vision has been blinded and whose hearts have been hardened by Allah . \n` Beware , oh Sunni scholars - has your sons ' blood become so cheap in your eyes that you have sold it for a low price ? \nHas the honor of your women become so trivial in your eyes ? \nIt is a declaration of war on Iraq 's Shias last week , Western officials fear , that has exploded in the middle of the rapidly souring relations between even those Sunnis and Shias who had previously sought to ignore the country 's sectarian differences . \nIn the directness of its call to arms , it suggests an al-Qaeda in Iraq that is emboldened and far from worn down by the long months of war . \nIt is this that is alarming US and UK intelligence officials most . \nThe most frightening development of all is the way in which Sunni nationalist insurgent leaderships and al-Qaeda 's leaderships are growing closer in a number of areas . \n` There used to be a clear division in our minds between what we used to call `` terrorists '' and `` insurgents '' in Iraq , ' said the Whitehall official . \n` Now there is a blurring as these groups come closer together . ' \nFrom a political point of view , any closing of the gap between the wider insurgency and al-Qaeda is deeply problematic for the policy of trying to engage those insurgents who could be incorporated into Iraq 's political process , and thus isolating al - Qaeda and the hardliners . \nNone of which is any consolation to the families of the dead labourers of Kadhimiya . \n"}
{"id": "179", "time": "2005-09-18", "text": "Lewis Lapham 's collection of journalism , Theater of War , shows he was right about Bush , the ` war on terror ' and Iraq . \nBeing right is n't enough , says Peter Preston Here , in 20 graceful , witty , prophetic essays , is everything that 's good about American journalism -LRB- and a rich slice of American society , too -RRB- . \nThe editor of Harper 's magazine writes like a dream , researches like a punctilious professor of classical history and finds his lonely judgments vindicated time and again . \nThe difficulty - and it is a difficulty - is that that good side comes with a greyer side that readers outside America ca n't ignore , a built-in impotence verging on tragic irrelevance . \nBut let 's hit the high spots first . \nWe have Lapham , aged 10 , remembering the day America dropped a bomb on Hiroshima , the day Buckminster Fuller saw humanity begin ` taking its final exam ' . \nSo , almost six decades on , the fear of a nuclear weapon brought into Manhattan ` does n't seem much different from the fear of a nuclear weapon delivered to the same address by a Soviet submarine 70 miles east of Nantucket ' . \nHe did n't buy the ` war on terrorism ' . \nHe did n't buy Iraq . \nHe despised the phoney build-up to a phoney war as a cowed , blinkered media played dumb and Congress became the voice of the ` frightened rich ' . \nHe scorned the White House 's crude propaganda . \n` In place of Hitler or Stalin , the American armies found the remnants of a dictator more accurately compared to a psychopathic prison warden , a brutal but almost comic figure . ' \nHe was right on WMDs , right on the messy aftermath of invasion , right on the hollow rhetoric of Team Bush . \nCrucially , he is right about the theater of war , a melodrama that seemingly dooms the United States , century after century , to suppress its internal tensions because of some confected outside threat , to choose a ` war ' against terrorists , drug dealers or communist remnants rather than save the poor blacks of New Orleans -LRB- or collect their bodies weeks after the flood -RRB- . \nThis is passionate stuff , triumphant in its foresight and nowhere reaching for the crutch of hindsight . \nSo what 's the problem ? \nSimply , alas , that Lapham 's too infinitely erudite for his , or our , good . \nWashington 2005 as the Rome of two millenniums ago ? \nQuotes up front from Auden , Marlowe , Keats and Bertrand Russell ? \nTwo paragraphs at the end of an essay on global warming and mankind 's fragility manage to mention Bach , Dachau , the altars of Poseidon , Elizabethan merchants buying French cannons , the thoughts of Loren Eiseley and memories of Cisalpine Gaul . \nWell , we all like to show off a bit . \nWhat 's the use of 70-plus years of high-minded education if you ca n't use it in your daily business ? \nEmperor Heraclius , Suleiman the Magnificent and Donald Rumsfeld march in step through these pages . \nBut you can have too much of a sumptuously referenced thing and Lapham does n't know where to stop . \nThe American public is n't as stupid as its political leaders suppose , he says . \nHe has faith in their wisdom . \nAnd the case he makes about the tacky , self-serving nature of American democracy could n't be more dazzlingly argued . \nTime after time , current events bear him out . \nBut why , then , does n't that triumph of analysis catch the wise electorate 's imagination to change policies and directions ? \nIt 's not a hard question to answer . \nBecause Joe Public is a bit blank about Suleiman the Magnificent . \nBecause Lapham seems to be writing for a coterie of curled lips , mostly within 20 miles of Fifth Avenue . \nBecause he makes no real effort to break out and move the hearts and minds that might move mountains . \nThere 's a nice quote from the master about politicians being trained ` to know the taste of the boot polish ' , but Mencken preached in a broader church . \nLapham sits with others in the side chapel of Gore Vidal . \nHe mocks other journalists truckling to the corporations that own their minds and pens . \nHe ca n't find a single recent President to admire . \nNot Kennedy , the ` spendthrift heir ' , not Carter , nor Clinton , never mind the burning Bushes . \nAmerica 's voters do n't require ` presidential candidates to know where to look on the map for Zanzibar or Romania ' , apparently . \n` Lack of knowledge on the topics of foreign affairs is a proof of virtue . ' \nThey airily waved George W through as he flubbered away . \nBut sometimes , surely , it 's necessary for political writers to get serious about deadly serious politics . \nSometimes , they have to make the connections that move the minds of the people who matter . \nOne tragedy of America 's present predicament , to be sure , is a fourth estate too cowed or corporatised to challenge the money and power which shadow their existence . \nHere comes Halliburton , contracted rebuilder of New Orleans ; you 'd laugh if you were n't crying first . \nThe friends of Cheney , supposed saviors of Baghdad , have risen to a new cash challenge . \nYet where are the voices that could make a difference ? \nFox News has such voices . \nThey turn dodgy theses into reality by the rasping certainty of their repetition . \nThe right shouts with a will and calls that winning the argument . \nAmerica 's big city chain papers have a few dissenting voices , but balance them out so they are canceled out . \nEven the New York Times and the Washington Post have mumbled into their martinis these past five years . \nAnd the rest , if not silent , exist only in a few small corners of intellectual refinement sprayed lightly with contempt . \nMaybe New Orleans has swilled some of that caution and intellectual scorn away . \nMaybe the spectacle of so much poverty , so much black poverty , in a toxic backyard will flush out the corners of the salons . \nDo n't bet on it , though . \nThe right has already found Mr Bush not guilty and waits for the worst of the shouting to die away . \nIs Louis Lapham an adornment to American journalism ? \nIs his critique of wars not worth the fighting perceptive and exhilarating ? \nOften better than that . \nWhy , then , do he and his fellow sages sit on the peripheries of influence and concern under any administration , Democrat or Republican ? \nBecause , in part , they choose to ; because the sidelines fit their sense of rectitude and superior self better . \nIt 's a terrible shame . \n"}

' \nBill Clinton , the former US President who was hosting the conference , also attacked the tone of the BBC coverage at a seminar on the media . \nHe said it had been ` stacked up ' to criticise the federal government 's slow response . \nSir Howard Stringer , chief executive of Sony Corporation and a former head of CBS News , said he had been ` nervous about the slight level of gloating ' by the corporation . \nThe disapproval will come as a blow to BBC executives , who had declared themselves delighted with the hurricane coverage , led by Matt Frei . \nThey believed they had learned the lessons from the Boxing Day tsunami in Asia , when the BBC was regarded as being slow off the mark . \nBlair 's reported comments were strongly criticised last night by Martin Bell , the former BBC war correspondent and former MP . \nBell said : ` Assuming it 's accurate - it may of course be that Tony Blair was simply telling Rupert Murdoch what he thought he wanted to hear . \nIf he really does have a gripe with the BBC coverage , there is no shortage of forums in which he can say so publicly . \nBut the last time he picked a fight with the BBC , as I recall , the government came off rather badly . ' \nHe added : ' I think Matt Frei 's reporting was absolutely immaculate and reflected the fact that one of the things the BBC is there for is to report events as they happened rather than as politicians may want them perceived to have happened . \nIf Tony Blair does want to confront the BBC over this , I 'd be surprised - because he would find absolutely zero support , except perhaps among his usual henchmen . ' \nCharles Wheeler , the veteran former US correspondent for the BBC , said : ' I do n't believe Murdoch actually said that . \nIt does n't sound like Blair to me . \nThe coverage I saw was extremely good and got better and better . \nMatt Frei was very good . \nHe got quite angry , which is what might have annoyed people . ' \nI do n't see why people should be unemotional ; I never was . \nYou have to tell people what you feel and what you hate - that 's part of legitimate reporting . ' \nA spokesman for the BBC said last night : ` We have received no complaint from Downing Street , so it would be remiss of us to comment on what is reported as a private conversation . ' \n"}

\nPerhaps we should not be surprised . \nBlair emerges from Meyer 's unique perspective as shallow and vainglorious , starstruck by American power and razzmatazz ; Straw as an empty suit , inexplicably tongue-tied even in the presence of such Washington non-luminaries as Janet Reno and Louis Freeh . \nWe learn how the Prime Minister ` pulsed with ill-suppressed excitement ' during his first official visit to the US ; how he put on ' a pair of ball-crushingly tight dark-blue corduroys ' after ` intensive debate within No 10 ' on what was meant by informal dress ; and of the near-catastrophe when Mrs Blair 's hairdresser was left behind at Camp David , averted only when a chopper was sent for him ` as the rest of us kicked our heels ' . \nBut such knockabout stuff would be mere cruel diversion were the book not also a tragic indictment of the dysfunction of 21st-century British government - the marginalisation of the Foreign Office and the soaring ascendancy of Blairite courtiers - and of the dangers of voting into office a party whose leader had nil governmental experience . \n` We want you to get up the arse of the White House and stay there , ' is the instruction Meyer says he received from Blair 's chief of staff , Jonathan Powell . \nIndeed , bitterness and resentment pulse through this book once Blair starts to stalk its pages . \nMeyer 's version of history is that he and the Foreign Office were soon jettisoned in favor of the superstar politicking to which Blair gravitated ; that , in the year leading up to the Iraq invasion , his embassy warned London of the defective plans Washington was making and its rudimentary notions of how the country would be administered after Saddam . \nMeyer concedes that he was in favor of invading Iraq and even that he found George W Bush ` as smart as a whip ' , but believes that Downing Street had a vendetta against the embassy which ultimately led to its fatal misjudgments . \nWe will not know how much of this is justified until government papers are released sometime in the 2030s , or until and when Greenstock and other privileged insiders are free to have their say , too . \nWhat is clear , though , is that Blair simply failed to comprehend that neocons such as Paul Wolfowitz and Richard Perle , whom Meyer says Colin Powell privately dismissed as ` fucking crazies ' , saw Iraq as ` the anvil on which they could forge a realignment of the Middle East ' , and that Britain was being inexorably dragged down their path . \nThose same neocons also see a strong Europe as a threat to American hegemony , and Meyer describes how Rupert Murdoch and senior Republicans complained to him over dinner about Britain 's ` appeasement ' towards France ; such mutterings from the American right alone , it seems , were soon enough for Blair to abandon Churchill 's long-held strategy that British support for a powerful US must be balanced by strong ties to both Europe and the Commonwealth . \n` Blair 's famous bridge between Europe and America , ' Meyer notes , ` was sinking beneath the waves . ' \nHis central thesis , though , that ` the ace up our sleeve was that America did not want to go alone ' into Iraq , simply does not stand up . \nBritain has always relished the deceit that , when it comes to the so-called special relationship , it plays the role of the cultured and intellectually superior Athenian murmuring words of wisdom into the ear of the mightier but uncouth Roman . \nThe truth is that Washington 's ear always remains resolutely deaf unless what is said is something it wants to hear . \nBlair mouthed only sweet nothings but America would still have stormed to war with or without Britain , as Donald Rumsfeld made derisively clear at the time . \nMeyer , besides , has done himself no favors with this book . \nHe emerges not so much as the Sir Crispin Mandarin of Private Eye parody but more , sometimes , as Dame Sylvie Krin . \nEccentrically , he habitually wore red socks and he and his wife captivated Washington in a way I have never seen - perhaps the Blairites were jealous ? \n- but we read too much about his laddish ways , such as how he was ` looking at Catherine 's legs ' at the British embassy in Bonn while ` she sensed my eyes boring into her calves like red-hot pokers ' . \nWhat would now be fascinating to read would be the memoirs of the fifth occupant during my time of what Meyer repeatedly calls that Great House - those of Sir David Manning , the present ambassador . \nHe straddled the roles of Foreign Office diplomat and inner-cabal adviser and was at Blair 's side throughout the build-up to war and beyond . \nMeyer , in fact , is still beside himself that he learned Manning was to succeed him not from the British government , but from Washington . \nSo does Blair , I wonder , now listen to Manning any more than he did to Meyer ? \nDoes Manning agree that the role of the British ambassador is to stay up the arse of the White House ? \nAnd what would Manning himself make of Bush ` splitting his sides ' when he learns that a character in a film is called Gay Focker ? \nDid he relish his ambassadorial task introducing Cherie Blair on the stage of the Kennedy Centre when she was promoting her money-spinning book ? \nWe would all love to know . \nBut given the experiences that have befallen both Greenstock and Meyer in Blair 's brave new Britain , I very much doubt whether we will . \nEducation Lancing College ; Lycee Henri IV , Paris ; Peterhouse College , Cambridge ; Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies , Bologna . \nCareer Ambassador to Germany -LRB- Mar-Oct 1997 -RRB- ; Ambassador to the US -LRB- 1997-2003 -RRB- ; chairman , Press Complaints Commission -LRB- 2004-present -RRB- . \nFamily Married to Lady Catherine Laylle . \nOn Blair : ` He liked the vision thing , but he was n't interested in the ballast behind the ideas .

{"id": "210", "time": "2005-11-13", "text": "Lessons from the history man Robert Fisk charts the modern history of the Middle East as he examines the causes of current chaos in The Great War for Civilisation , says Rebecca Seal In 1905 , when the Middle East 's most modern crisis was in its infancy , American philosopher George Santayana wrote : ` Those who can not remember the past are condemned to repeat it . ' \nThat remark came to mind when reading Robert Fisk 's latest book , which is so much more than a modern history of the Middle East . \nIt starts with Fisk 's hair-raising 1997 meeting with Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan , then takes us via many of the trouble spots of the last three decades to conclude in Iraq . \nFisk , the Independent 's veteran foreign correspondent , also examines the 1920 occupation of Iraq by British forces , the roots of the Arab-Israeli conflict and other events which lead us to the ludicrous present where soldiers from the most sophisticated armies in the world have to be protected by private security firms in Iraq and where the threat of terrorism is a fact of daily life from Bali to London . \nFisk repeatedly emphasises messages that he feels should have been learned from history , as well as the arrogance of the decision-makers who ignored the past , or were ignorant of it . \nDid anyone heed the fact that in 1920 the well-armed British occupiers of Iraq were battered by a local insurgency which arose , among other places , in Basra ? \nDid anyone notice there has never , ever , been an easy occupation of this area ? \nOr that the mujahideen , who fought the Soviet occupiers of Afghanistan in the Eighties and have re-emerged in Iraq , would find a fertile recruiting ground in such towns as Fallujah among Iraqis who have been beaten or tortured or merely heard of atrocities by their occupiers ? \n` Torture works , ' boasted an American Special Forces friend of Fisk 's , a claim disproved by one man who claimed to have been tortured . ' \nI have a one-year-old daughter and I would happily put a bomb in her clothes and send her to the Americans to kill them ' , he said . \nFisk claims the insurgency in Iraq could have been avoided if America and Britain had heeded bin Laden five weeks before the 2003 invasion , when he made it clear that if it went ahead , he would encourage all Muslims to co-operate with Saddam 's Baath party against the Americans and British . \nFor Fisk : ` This was the moment the future guerrilla army fused with the future suicide bombers ... and we did n't even notice ' . \nBut when the battle is about oil and power , decision-makers are n't looking at history for mistakes to avoid . \nThey are too busy trying to get away with what they are doing . \nAnd there is a vast gap between knowing and caring . \nRobert Fisk , who has been dodging bullets for nearly 30 years , examines what motivates him , and others like him , to do this extraordinary job . \nHe is n't above occasionally glamorising the tale , but there is a strong sense that this is , beyond his need to understand these wars , a chance for him to try to understand his other need to be present at all of them . \nWrite your review of this or any other book , find out what other readers thought or add it to your lists Letters for publication should be sent to : letters@observer.co.uk If you need help using the site : userhelp@guardian.co.uk Call the main Guardian and Observer switchboard : Observer review : The Great War for Civilisation by Robert Fisk This article appeared on p17 of the Observer Review section of the Observer on 15.09 GMT on Sunday 13 November 2005 . \n"}
