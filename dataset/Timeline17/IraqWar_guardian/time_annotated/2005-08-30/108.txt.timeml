How to stop civil war Nicaragua and South Africa , not the US , should be the inspiration for the people framing Iraq 's constitution <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2005-08-30">Tuesday</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2005-08-30">30 August 2005</TIMEX3> 11.05 BST Between the idea and the reality falls the shadow of occupation .
Whatever the parliamentarians in Iraq do to try to prevent total meltdown , their efforts are compromised by the fact that their power grows from the barrel of someone else 's gun .
When George Bush picked up the phone <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2005-W34">last week</TIMEX3> to urge the negotiators to sign the constitution , he reminded Iraqis that their representatives - though elected - remain the administrators of his protectorate .
While US and British troops stay in Iraq , no government there can make an undisputed claim to legitimacy .
Nothing can be resolved in that country until our armies leave .
This is by no means the only problem confronting the people who drafted Iraq 's constitution .
The refusal by the Shias and the Kurds to make serious compromises on federalism , which threatens to deprive the central , Sunni - dominated areas of oil revenues , leaves the Sunnis with little choice but to reject the agreement in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2005-10">October</TIMEX3> 's referendum .
The result could be civil war .
Can anything be done ?
It might be too late .

But it seems to me that the transitional assembly has one last throw of the dice .
This is to abandon the constitution it has signed , and Bush 's self - serving timetable , and start again with a different democratic design .
The problem with the way the constitution was produced is the problem afflicting almost all the world 's democratic processes .
The deliberations were back to front .
First the members of the constitutional committee , shut inside the green zone , argue over every dot and comma ; then they present the whole thing -LRB- 25 pages in English translation -RRB- to the people for a yes or no answer .
The question and the answer are meaningless .
All politically conscious people , having particular interests and knowing that perfection in politics is impossible , will , on reading a complex document like this , see that it is good in some places and bad in others .
They might recognize some articles as being bad for them but good for society as a whole ; they might recognize others as being good or bad for almost everyone .
What then does yes or no mean ?
Let me be more precise .
How , for example , could anyone agree with both these statements , from articles 2 and 19 respectively ?
` ` Islam is the official religion of the state and is a basic source of legislation : no law can be passed that contradicts the undisputed rules of Islam . ''
-LRB-
In other words , the supreme authority in law is God .
-RRB- ` ` The judiciary is independent , with no power above it other than the law . ''
Or both these , from articles 14 and 148 ?
` ` Iraqis are equal before the law without discrimination because of sex , ethnicity , nationality , origin , color , religion , sect , belief , opinion or social or economic status '' ; ` ` Members of the presidential council must ... have left the dissolved party -LRB- the Ba'ath
-RRB- <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P10Y" mod="EQUAL_OR_MORE">at least 10 years</TIMEX3> before its fall if they were members in it . ''
Faced with such contradictions , no thoughtful elector can wholly endorse or reject this document .
Of course , this impossible choice is what we would have confronted -LRB-
but at 10 times the length and a hundred times the complexity -RRB- had we been asked to vote on the European constitution .
The yes or no question put to us would have been just as stupid , and just as just as stupefying .
It treats us like idiots and - because we can not refine our responses - reduces us to idiots .
But while it would have merely enhanced our sense of alienation from the European project , for the Iraqis the meaninglessness of the question could be a matter of life and death .
If there is not a widespread sense of public ownership of the country 's political processes , and a widespread sense that political differences can be meaningfully resolved by democratic means , this empowers those who seek to resolve them otherwise .
<TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2005-W34">Last week</TIMEX3> George Bush , echoed on these pages by Bill Clinton 's former intelligence adviser Philip Bobbitt , compared the drafting process in Baghdad to the construction of the American constitution .
If they believe that the comparison commends itself to the people of Iraq , they are plainly even more out of touch than I thought .
But it should also be obvious that we <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> live in more sceptical times .
When the US constitution was drafted , representative democracy was a radical and thrilling idea .
<TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> it is an object of suspicion and even contempt , as people all over the world recognize that it allows us to change the management but not the firm .
And one of the factors that have done most to engender public scepticism is the meaninglessness of the only questions we are ever asked .
I read Labor 's manifesto before the last election and found good and bad in it .
But whether I voted for or against , I had no means to explain what I liked and what I did n't .
Does it require much imagination to see the link between our choice of meaningless absolutes and the Manichean worldview our leaders have evolved ?
We must decide at elections whether they are right or wrong - about everything .
Should we then be surprised when they start talking about good and evil , friend and foe , being with them or against them ?
<TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2003" mod="APPROX">Almost two years ago</TIMEX3> Troy Davis , a democracy - engineering consultant , pointed out that if a constitutional process in Iraq was to engender trust and national commitment , it had to ` ` promote a culture of democratic debate '' .
Like Professor Vivien Hart , of the University of Sussex , he argued that it should draw on the experiences of Nicaragua in <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="1986">1986</TIMEX3> , where 100,000 people took part in townhall meetings reviewing the draft constitution , and of South Africa , where the public made 2 million submissions to the drafting process .
In both cases , the sense of public ownership this fostered accelerated the process of reconciliation .
Not only is your own voice heard in these public discussions , but you must also hear others .
Hearing them , you are confronted with the need for compromise .

But when negotiations are confined to the green zone 's black box , the Iraqis have no sense that the process belongs to them .
Because they are not asked to participate , they are not asked to understand where other people 's interests lie and how they might be accommodated .

And when the whole thing goes belly up , it will be someone else 's responsibility .
If Iraq falls apart <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="PXY" mod="MORE_THAN">over the next couple of years</TIMEX3> , it would not be unfair , among other factors , to blame the fact that Davis and Hart were ignored .
For the people who designed Iraq 's democratic processes , history stopped in <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="1787">1787</TIMEX3> .
Deliberative democracy is not a panacea .
You can have fake participatory processes just as you can have fake representative ones .
But it is hard to see why representation can not be tempered by participation .
Why should we be forbidden to choose policies , rather than just parties or entire texts ?
Can we not be trusted ?
If not , then what is the point of elections ?
The age of purely representative democracy is surely over .
It is time the people had their say .
