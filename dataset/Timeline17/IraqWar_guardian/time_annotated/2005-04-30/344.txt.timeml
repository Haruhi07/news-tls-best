You can email the author at Rafael.Behr@observer.co.uk On your online front page you have all the lies , evasions and truth - twisting of Blair , and proof that he took us into an illegal war ; and yet you also have that increasingly shrill and desperate war - supporter Aaronovitch telling us to vote for the party that did this , plus a leader endorsing the <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> government .
Once upon a time , you could at least rely on the Observer to be consistent , rather than offer such such rank hypocrisy .
What you are saying to your readers is ` yes , we know they lied , yes , we know they ruined the image of are country in the eyes of the world , yes , 100,000 people died , yes , they are authoritarian and illiberal , but hey , vote for them anyway , you sheep .
I have been a lifelong Guardian and Observer reader and a former Labor party member , but you and New Labor can go hang .
I ' m switching to the Lib Dems and the Independent .
the Observer\/Guardian has nailed its colors to the New Labor mast , and as far as I am concerned , it can go down with Blair 's sinking ship .

Do n't get it , Sandriana .
The Attorney General 's advice supported Blair 's position : its -LRB- overdue -RRB- release does n't expose a single ` lie ' and states there was a strong legal case for the war .
You 're giving it a very blinkered read ...
And frankly , if enough intelligent , well - meaning people like you also jump to the Lib Dems on <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2005-04-28">Thursday</TIMEX3> , there 's a fair chance of Michael Howard being PM on <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2005-04-29">Friday</TIMEX3> .
Wo n't that be nice ?
Wo n't that make Britain better ?
Wo n't you be pleased with yourself ?
Enjoy the Independent , anyway .

David :
Oooh , well that 's me told then .
The atty gen ` ls advice emphatically did not support the PM 's position .
Like any good legal opinion , it laid out the arguments for and against and which arguments were weak , and which were strong .
No sensible lawyer would come down one side or the other : the decision is up to the client , which was the cabinet , not Blair ; not unless we have suddenly changed over to a presidential system .
The cabinet did not have the benefit of the full written legal advice -LRB- and before you jump on me , read Blair loyalist Patricia Hewitt 's own testimony to this : she first saw it <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2005-W16">last week</TIMEX3> on Channel 4 's website -RRB- , so any decision they made to support Blair 's and Bush 's little Iraq adventure was made in ignorance of the true legal position , not to mention ignorance of the lack of WMD .
The verbal advice they did get bore little relation to the equivocal written legal advice , by Blair 's own admission : he told Parliament it was ` clear and unequivocal ' , which , if you actually read it , it patently was n't .
<TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2005-04-30">Today</TIMEX3> 's revelations show clearly that the decsion to go to war was made by Blair himself , presidentially , following meetings with and representations by the Republicans .
That verbal advice given to cabinet by Lord Goldsmith was given following a visit to the US , and ` discussion ' with Alberto Gonzalez , John Ashcroft , William Taft IV et al , all rabid neocon supporters of the ` pre - emptive ' strike doctrine , clearly illegal under international law .
Blair , again by his own admission , took the decision himself to commit regime change in Iraq -LRB- again illegal , as Goldsmith himself pointed out -RRB- , any subsequent decisions made by Cabinet and Parliament were made on the basis of false inmformation provided by the PM .
As for the chance of Michael Howard being PM : keep on with the scare tactics if you want , go on , hold on to nurse for fear of something worse .
the maths that labor has done rely on every single person who voted labor last time doing so again , plus nabbing any floating voters .
Dream on , but do n't be surprised when not even your core vote turns out on <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2005-04-28">Thursday</TIMEX3> .
All bets are off .
For this paper call for us to vote for this government after all that has passed is a blatant exercise in poitical cynicism .
Andrew : if the best you can do is parrot , why bother ?

Over at the Independent they debunk the myth that voting for the Lib Dems will put the Tories in power .
-LRB- Surprise , surprise : the Tories will only get to power if Labor votes swing to them -RRB- .
The Observer has compromised its historic principles over the Iraq war .
From a moral perspective war can only be just if it is a last resort , and if it is waged justly .
Blair fails on both counts .
-LRB- 1
-RRB- We wanted the UN inspecters to continue doing their job of disarming Saddam .
Blair could have supported the French and German proposals for beefing up the inspection team , and putting UN forces on the ground to create no - go zones for Saddam 's troops -LRB- like the no - fly zones in the North -RRB- .
Let 's stop this peddling of lies that the choice was leaving Saddam in power or invading !
-LRB- 2 -RRB-
The war has been waged unjustly using depleted uranium , targetting of civilians and bombing and flattening of civilian homes , and widespread torture .
Because these are British and American troops doing evil , does not make it OK .
On top of that , under the same banner ` ` war against terrorism '' we have seen Guantanamo Bay and the ` ` rendition '' of prisoners by the US -LRB- with UK aid -RRB- to countries where they can be tortured , and at home we have seen the erosion of our civil liberties .
We have a principle of ministerial accountability , but it does n't seem to apply to the PM .
The best thing Blair could have done , <TIMEX3 tid="t37" type="DATE" value="2004">last year</TIMEX3> say , was to resign on the basis that he ` ` unintentionally '' misled parliament and the public .
-LRB-
In fact , if he seriously believed that there was a danger of letting the Tories in through the back door this is what he would have done -RRB- .
As he has failed to do so , I suggest that all Labor supporters -LRB- I am a stalwart of <TIMEX3 tid="t39" type="DURATION" value="P40Y" mod="MORE_THAN">over 40 years</TIMEX3> -RRB- follow the lead of Brian Sedgemore and vote for the Lib Dems .
As for the Observer : There is hypocracy in arguing that the Americans , having re - elected Bush , are <TIMEX3 tid="t40" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> culpable for their misadventure in Iraq but suggesting that we vote for Blair to keep Howard out .
Posted by TC on <TIMEX3 tid="t43" type="DATE" value="2005-05-01">May 1 , 2005</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t45" type="TIME" value="2005-05-01T19:34">07:34 PM</TIMEX3> .
I 'd like express my own disappointment at the Observer 's decision to support Blair .
Leaving aside Iraq , which has been well covered above , there are other issues .
Blair continues to use the ` ` Vote Lib Dem , get the Tories '' argument but this claim has no basis in fact .
As TC notes above , the Independent has shown that it is untrue .
Channel 4 Factcheck has done likewise .
If you 'd like to try a little experiment of your own you can also use Peter Snow 's Swingometer on the BBC website .
It predicts a 18.5 % swing from Labor to the Lib Dems would be needed for this result :
Con 231 , Lab 230 , LD 155 .
Anyone seriously arguing that this result would lead to a Conservative government ?
There is no Lab\/LD swing which can lead to the Conservatives winning an overall majority .
And besides , Mr Blair promised to introduce PR in the <TIMEX3 tid="t46" type="DATE" value="1997">1997</TIMEX3> manifesto .
<TIMEX3 tid="t47" type="DATE" value="2005">8 years later</TIMEX3> he 's using the unfairnes of FPTP to frighten people into voting Labor .
Do n't blame the system you promised to reform , Mr Blair , you ' ve had <TIMEX3 tid="t51" type="DURATION" value="P8Y">8 years</TIMEX3> to change it !

Before you put full faith in that argument , you might like to ask yourself why they covered something like 30 scenarios , but not one in which the tory percentage vote was as far from the poll value as it has been in every single one of <TIMEX3 tid="t57" type="DATE" value="2004-H2">the last half</TIMEX3> - dozen or so elections .
While it is theoretically possible they are right , it would be unprecedented in modern politics .

This is not about the election but the article ` ` It 's official : Acupuncture really works '' , which would be hilarious if it was n't so depressing .
Suggestion and qualification being presented as proof , depressing stuff .
We 're only told that genuine acupuncture created brain activity - the author does n't even bother to state which , if any , of the control groups displayerd a universal improvement in their symptoms .
Probably because none did , which would demonstrate -LRB- again -RRB- that acupuncture is pure quackery -RRB- .
It does n't take a genius to notice that all the -LRB- stress induced -RRB- illnesses listed as being treated by acupuncture come straight after we 're shown the amateur psychiatry associated with the ` ` treatment '' .
A pathetic article masquerading as Health\/Science in an otherwise intelligent newspaper .

I think it is great the Observer opens its pages to its readers and discovers that some live in a greater fantasy world than some of its political commentators .
My mind goes out to the words of Nixon who said something along the lines of ` ` it ca n't be illegal if the President of the United States does it . ''
Have these people not been elected to rule this county and does n't that allow them to lead us in to war anytime they want for any reason they want ?
Do we believe in giving men power and then tripping them up when they try and make decisions that we -LRB- and that includes me , if you must know -RRB- do n't approve of ?
And what about all the smarmy knockers who say ` ` it is all about oil . ''
We live in a world dominated by oil .
The world we know and enjoy is spun around it .
Who knows what will happened when the stuff starts running out and prices go through the roof ?
Is this country going to start riding bikes or start throwing bricks ?
Blair has n't done a bad job for this country and it is right that he should be re - elected .
The initial public love affair was never going to last - but I think his record is quite respectable and will probably be viewed more kindly when he calls it <TIMEX3 tid="t69" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> .
