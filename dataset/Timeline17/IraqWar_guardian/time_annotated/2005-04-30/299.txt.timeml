BST Sudan 's Islamist regime , once shunned by Washington for providing a haven for Osama bin Laden as well as for human rights abuses during decades of civil war , has become an ally in the Bush administration 's ` ` war on terror '' .
Only months after the US accused Khartoum of carrying out genocide in Darfur , Sudan has become a crucial intelligence asset to the CIA .
In the Middle East and Africa , Sudan 's agents have penetrated networks that would not normally be accessible to America , one former US intelligence official told the Guardian .
Some of that cooperation has spilled over into the war in Iraq : Sudan is credited with detaining foreign militants on their way to join anti - American fighters there .
Sudanese agents have also helped the CIA to monitor Islamist organizations in Somalia .
` ` The intelligence relationship is the strongest thread between Washington and Khartoum , '' the official said .
` ` Khartoum is probably the only government in the Arab League that has contributed in a major way to the protection of US forces and citizens in Iraq . ''
News of the growing cooperation was first reported in yes terday 's Los Angeles Times .
The paper traced the thaw in relations since <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2001">2001</TIMEX3> to a milestone <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2005-W16">last week</TIMEX3> : the visit to Washington by Sudan 's intelligence chief , Salah Abdallah Gosh .
It reported that Sudan 's secret police had begun to crack down on suspected Islamists , had shared evidence with the FBI and allowed US personnel to interrogate al - Qaida suspects .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2003-05">May 2003</TIMEX3> , Sudanese security forces raided a suspected terrorist training camp and deported more than a dozen , mainly Saudi , militants to Arab states which work closely with US intelligence services , the newspaper said .
Yet <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="199X">a decade ago</TIMEX3> Sudan was a haven to Bin Laden and other international outlaws , such as Carlos the Jackal .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="1993">1993</TIMEX3> , it was placed on the US state department 's list of terrorist regimes .
Approaches from Khartoum were rebuffed - even as it offered its services against an emerging al - Qaida in <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="199">the 1990s</TIMEX3> .
` ` Sudan tried to hand over two guys implicated in the <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="1998">1998</TIMEX3> bombing of the US embassies in east Africa , and the response was to send cruise missiles to hit the aspirin factory in Khartoum , '' the official said .
` ` They offered up Bin Laden in <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="1995">1995</TIMEX3> , and we said we do n't even have an indictment on him . ''
Officially , Washington 's position towards Sudan remains unchanged .
` ` Sudan is still considered a state sponsor of terror , '' a state department spokesman said <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2005-04-29">yesterday</TIMEX3> .
News of General Gosh 's visit to Washington caused consternation in human rights circles .
The general is among 51 Sudanese officials implicated in human rights abuses by the international criminal court .
` ` I quite understand that the war on terrorism means dealing with bad actors , but to fly in one of Sudan 's chief committers of what Washington has formally described as genocide is deeply disturbing , '' said an independent Sudan analyst , Eric Reeves .
He noted there had been signs of a slight thaw towards Khartoum for some time - despite the state department 's official stance .
