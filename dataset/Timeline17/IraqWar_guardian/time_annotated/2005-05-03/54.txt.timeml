A Coldstream Guardsman was killed and another injured by the blast of a roadside bomb in southern Iraq <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2005-05-02" mod="END">late yesterday</TIMEX3> , the Ministry of Defense said .
The two were on a night patrol in armored Land Rovers of the 1st Battalion , Coldstream Guards , near Amara .
The Shia - dominated city in the British - controlled zone has seen relatively few attacks in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent months</TIMEX3> .
The dead soldier was named as Guardsman Anthony John Wakefield , 24 , from Newcastle upon Tyne , who was married with three children .
` ` He was acting as the top cover sentry in the second of a two - vehicle patrol when what appears to have been an improvised explosive device detonated - disabling the vehicle and injuring another soldier , '' Lt Col Andrew Williams said .
` ` Despite receiving first aid at the scene and in the helicopter that evacuated him , he sadly died of wounds . ''
His colleague is thought not to be seriously injured .
The war in Iraq has been high on the general election agenda for <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2005-W17">the past week</TIMEX3> , and the death of a soldier so close to polling day will add to the pressure on Tony Blair .
Details of the attack emerged as insurgents continued their onslaught on Baghdad , with four car bombs killing 14 people <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2005-05-02">yesterday</TIMEX3> on the eve of the swearing - in of the Iraqi government cabinet .
Explosions shook the capital for a fifth consecutive day , and civilians again bore the brunt of attacks ; at least 127 people have been killed since a new administration was formed <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2005-W17">last week</TIMEX3> .
Nine people died when a van packed with explosives blew up in a mixed Shia and Sunni shopping district , hurling glass and debris across the street .
The defense secretary , Geoff Hoon , said <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2005-05-02">yesterday</TIMEX3> that Guardsman Wakefield 's death had come on what had been expected to be a routine operation .
He was the first British serviceman killed in action since <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2005-01">January</TIMEX3> , and the 87th to die since <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2003-03">March 2003</TIMEX3> .
<TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2004">Last year</TIMEX3> Amara , on the Tigris near the Iranian border , saw fierce fighting between the city 's 1,000 - strong British garrison and the Mahdi army militia of a radical Shia cleric , Moqtada al - Sadr , who led two uprisings against the US - led occupation .
Since a ceasefire agreed <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2004-08">last August</TIMEX3> , attacks on British troops had dwindled to just a few small - scale efforts <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="SET" value="P1W" quant="EACH">each week</TIMEX3> that until <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2005-05-01">Sunday</TIMEX3> caused no casualties .
Amara is 90 % Shia , and its residents turned out in force for the election that gave Shias their first taste of power in decades .
Mr Blair , speaking in London at Labor 's election news conference , said he offered his ` ` profound condolences '' to Guardsman Wakefield 's family .
The prime minister said his death ` ` underlines once again the extraordinary work and sacrifice that British armed forces are making in Iraq , to help Iraq become a stable and democratic country that 's no longer a threat to its region and the world '' .
The Conservative leader , Michael Howard , expressed his ` ` deep sympathy and sincere condolences '' to Guardsman Wakefield 's family , and the Liberal Democrat deputy leader , Sir Menzies Campbell , said : ` ` It 's a reminder that we have 8,000 young men and women in Iraq who expose themselves to danger on a daily basis . ''
<TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2005-05-02">Yesterday</TIMEX3> Guardsman Wakefield 's seven - year - old son Scott stood to attention in his pyjamas on the doorstep of the family home in Newcastle upon Tyne .
In a trembling voice he said : ` ` I am proud of my daddy ; he served his country and he died a hero . ''
His mother , Ann Toward , 30 , told how she had been told of her husband 's death <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2005-05-02" mod="START">early yesterday</TIMEX3> .
` ` I heard a knock at the door at 3.30 <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="TIME" value="2005-05-03TMO">this morning</TIMEX3> and knew instantly what had happened , '' she said .
` ` I answered the door to a man in a smart suit who handed me his card saying he was from the MoD .
I invited him in and he broke the news ...
I am devastated and shocked .
` ` He was such a brave man , I had two children with him and I am trying to explain to them that their dad wo n't be coming home .
It is very , very hard , it is only just beginning to sink in . ''
Ms Toward <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="TIME" value="2005-05-02TNI">last night</TIMEX3> blamed the prime minister for her husband 's death .
Speaking on the ITV News Channel , she said Mr Blair had deprived her three children of their father .
` ` He sent the troops over and he should not have done it .
If it was not for that , their dad would have been here <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="2005-05-03">today</TIMEX3> . ''
Besides Scott and Corey , two , Guardsman Wakefield also had a stepdaughter Stacey , 11 , from Ms Toward 's previous relationship .
Ms Toward added : ` ` It is only just beginning to sink in for Scott , he has been talking about his dad and wants to write him a letter to tell him how proud he is that he fought and died for his country .
He had been in the army for <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DURATION" value="P6Y">six years</TIMEX3> . ''
The couple had been married for <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">two years</TIMEX3> , but were in the process of separating .
Ms Toward said that she remembered her husband as a ` ` wonderful , fun , happy man - we were so close it was only the amount of time he was away that took its toll . ''
A classified version of the US report into the shooting of Italian agent Nicola Calipari , killed escorting the freed Italian journalist Giuliana Sgrena to safety , <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="TIME" value="2005-05-02TNI">last night</TIMEX3> revealed the true strength of the insur gency , writes Gary Younge .
