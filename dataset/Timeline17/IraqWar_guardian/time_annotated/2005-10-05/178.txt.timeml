Psychiatrist M Scott Peck , who has died aged 69 , made millions with his first book by advocating self - discipline , restraint , and responsibility - all qualities he openly acknowledged were notably lacking in himself .
The Road Less Travelled was first published in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="1978">1978</TIMEX3> .
It eventually spent <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P13Y">13 years</TIMEX3> on the New York Times bestseller list to create a paperback record , sold 10 million copies worldwide and was translated into more than 20 languages .
The opening words were : ` ` Life is difficult . ''
This was a pronouncement to which Peck could personally attest .
He spent much of his life immersed in cheap gin , chain - smoking cigarettes and inhaling cannabis , and being persistently unfaithful to his wife , who eventually divorced him .
He also went through estrangement with two of his three children .
Peck wrote openly of his adulterous affairs in another of his total of 15 books :
In Search of Stones : A Pilgrimage of Faith , Reason and Discovery -LRB- <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="1995">1995</TIMEX3> -RRB- , based on a visit to Britain to see ancient stone monuments .
Never lacking in personal honesty , at least in print , he once said he had ` ` the rare privilege of being able to give advice without having any responsibility '' .
Peck , whose personalised car number plate was THLOST , also spent much of his life seeking religious fulfilment -LRB-
he was baptised a Christian at 43 after embracing Zen and then Sufism -RRB- , and used this to explain his infidelities .
` ` There was an element of quest in my extramarital romances , '' he wrote .
` ` I was questing , through sexual romance , at least a brief visit to God 's castle . ''
Such visits , however brief , ceased when he became impotent , he disclosed .
The Road Less Travelled was written while Peck was running a successful private practice in Connecticut , but he received only $ 7,500 for publication after one publisher had dismissed it as ` ` too Christ - y '' .
Although a slow starter , its eventual massive success established Peck on the lecture circuit as well as confirming a valuable new genre for American publishers .
Peck was born in New York , the son of a lawyer who later became a judge .
His education at the Phillips Exeter academy was unhappy
and he later attacked its ` ` Spartan , almost vicious adolescent culture '' .
After psychological counselling , he moved to the Friends seminary , a Quaker school near Greenwich Village .
There he read about Zen and became a Buddhist , but retained an ambition to write ` ` the great American novel '' .
After briefly attending Middlebury College , from where he was expelled for refusing the required officers ' training classes , he entered Harvard thanks to his father 's influence .
He graduated in social relations and , despite his literary desires , began studying medicine at Columbia University before graduating from Case - Western Reserve University school of medicine in Ohio in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="1963">1963</TIMEX3> .

While at Columbia Peck met and married Lily Ho , a Chinese student from Singapore .
This caused his father , who was half Jewish but always concealed it , to disown him -LRB-
her parents disapproved , too -RRB- .

But he later relented and paid his son 's tuition fees .
Then Peck joined the army because , he later said , he needed the regular pay to support his wife and a family ; yet he also opposed the Vietnam war , then escalating .
He rose to become assistant chief of psychiatry at the US surgeon general 's office in Washington DC from <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="1970">1970</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="1972">1972</TIMEX3> , when he left the service with the rank of lieutentant colonel .
Years of private practice began and he incorporated case histories into the Road book and others .
After its success he followed with another bestseller , People of the Lie : The Hope for Healing Human Evil -LRB- <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="1983">1983</TIMEX3> -RRB- .
It was well received by critics , but with reservations about ` ` moral preachment '' .
His books included two novels and one for children .
Other non - fiction included The Different Drum -LRB- <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="1987">1987</TIMEX3> -RRB- and sequels to his first book , Further Along the Road Less Travelled -LRB- <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="1993">1993</TIMEX3> -RRB-
and The Road Less Traveled and Beyond -LRB- <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="1997">1997</TIMEX3> -RRB- .
His last work was Glimpses of the Devil -LRB- <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2005">2005</TIMEX3>
-RRB- , recounting his fascination with exorcism .
The success of his books was partly based on their mystical - spiritual content and although Peck always eschewed the idea of being a guru , there were cultish aspects to his popularity .
Of this he said : ` ` Half the time when people want to touch my robe , it feels incredibly icky - yuck !
The rest of the time , it feels very good , honest , right . ''
He and Lily divorced in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2003">2003</TIMEX3> and he remarried <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2004">last year</TIMEX3> .
He is survived by his second wife , and his two daughters and one son by Lily .
