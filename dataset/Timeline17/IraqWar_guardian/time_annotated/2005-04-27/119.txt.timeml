It is the duty of the young to go to the barricades for foolish causes , but <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2005-04-27">today</TIMEX3> 's students would rather drink than demonstrate <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2005-04-27">Wednesday</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2005-04-27">27 April 2005</TIMEX3> 01.50
BST At a <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> Oxbridge dinner , I heard a college dean remark that he had taken part in two political demonstrations lately , one against the Iraq war and the other against the ban on foxhunting .
By contrast , it was <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="PXY">some years</TIMEX3> since his students had marched further than the pub .
When undergraduates were told about a forthcoming rent review , college authorities awaited a howl of outrage .
Instead , to their amazement , the proposal was received with polite acquiescence .
This was not because the students in question are rich .
Rather , it is because few <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2005-04-27">today</TIMEX3> are willing to rouse themselves to protest about anything at all .
Our conversation about all this seemed comic .
Here we were , a gathering of men and women of whom few were under 40 and most a good deal more , lamenting campus tranquillity .
It is fair to suggest that more anger was apparent at our dinner table about the shortcomings of Blair 's government , the Iraq war and WMD , than among a host of twenty - somethings in their rooms across the quad .
Evidence suggests that this lack of student excitement is endemic , as it has been for <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="PXDE">a couple of decades</TIMEX3> .
There are pockets of activism .
The Iraq war prompted one huge spasm of protest in London , but this was exceptional .
How can we be surprised that the Apathy party is likely to prevail at this general election ?

If the best - educated section of British voters do not see any point in making a fuss , then why should millions living in relative economic contentment up and down the land ?
Real anger <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2005-04-27">today</TIMEX3> seems the privilege of a small metropolitan circle focused on the media , though characteristically many of its members kid themselves that they reflect popular views .
I never thought I should hear myself , well , protesting , about student inertia .

In <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="196">the 1960s</TIMEX3> and thereafter , when successive generations of long - haired weirdos seemed never to leave the streets , when a banner was a more important part of a student 's equipment than his library ticket , I was a cross little Conservative .
My kind watched in disdain as university faculty buildings were trashed , files ransacked , teachers abused .
There seemed a silliness about many protests , which attained its nadir in the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament .
The eagerness of Foots and Benns to offer a cry of anguish against their own society as a substitute for rational thought about the threat from the Soviet Union appeared pathetic .
<TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="P40Y">Forty years</TIMEX3> on , it seems much easier than I found it then to recognize how important it is for the young to be angry about something - it does not much matter what .
Old Jacob Bronowski , a <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="196">60s</TIMEX3> figure if ever there was one , was surely right when he wrote about university life in <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="1973">1973</TIMEX3> : ` ` It is important that students bring a certain ragamuffin , barefoot irreverence to their studies ; they are not here to worship what is known , but to question it . ''
This principle obviously extends beyond the lecture room , to life .
<TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2005-04-27">Today</TIMEX3> , I feel a respect for <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="196">the 60s</TIMEX3> protesters -LRB- if not for the decade 's violent extremists -RRB- that at the time I lacked the imagination to muster .
True , they were often protesting for the fun of the game , rather than because they had thought coherently about the merits of the cause .
Their enthusiasm for Mao Zedong and Ho Chi Minh -LRB-
no liberal democrat , he -RRB- was absurdly naive , as even Jane Fonda concedes .
Yet they were right that the Vietnam war was a barbaric American folly .
It was good that they shouted slogans and asked questions , because somebody had to .
Maybe even the CND protesters contributed something , by articulating revulsion .
The wise men on both sides of the Atlantic knew that a nuclear conflict meant the end of civilisation , but we <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> know that some generals , on the American as well as the Soviet side , were occasionally tempted to think otherwise .
All this brings us back to <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2005-04-27">today</TIMEX3> 's students .
It is said that they are too preoccupied with the struggle to prepare themselves to find jobs to have time for political frivolities .
These are the university kids whom Camille Paglia described contemptuously as ` ` an army of pedestrian , toadying careerists '' .
I do not buy this line .
Even if a minority are working harder than we ever did , most still have plenty of leisure .
They simply choose to spend it in different ways .
They would rather drink than demonstrate .
They are more passionate about sport than the fate of Iraq .
It seems bizarre to be promoting the cause of student activism .
Yet surely anyone who cares about British democracy should be bothered about our culture of acquiescence , not least in the re - election of a British prime minister who committed the nation to war on the basis of massive falsehoods , some of George Bush 's making but most of his own .
Where are the Peter Hains , Jack Straws , Tariq Alis ?
Where is the fierce , intolerant conviction that old men and women are getting it wrong , that it is time for a new generation to seize the levers ?
The excuse will not wash that life has become so serious that , for a student , self - preservation is all .
It seems more plausible that the young are succumbing to the material complacency that is paralysing the peoples of several western democracies , rendering them apparently unwilling to consider idealistic issues at all .
They profess some interest in the environment .
They want to save whales , but it is hard to imagine them renouncing the wares of Sony and Sanyo in the cause , as the Hains renounced apartheid sherry .
They are dismayed by horrors in Africa , but would rather spend <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="TIME" value="2005-04-30TAF">Saturday afternoon</TIMEX3> watching Man U than demonstrating outside Downing Street about western supineness .
They shrug : what difference can we make ?

Yet the young are supposed to cherish vain hopes and go to the barricades for foolish causes .
A world in which a college dean protests while his students swot in their rooms or head for the pub is topsy - turvy indeed .
It does not matter what they protest about , if they will only bestir themselves to become agitated about something .
They might even demonstrate against Peter Hain .
