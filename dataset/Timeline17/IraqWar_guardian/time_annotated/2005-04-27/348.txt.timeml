Conservative party co - chairman , Liam Fox , and shadow chief secretary to the treasury , George Osborne , unveil the latest Conservative campaign poster .
Photograph : Daniel Berehulak\/Getty Michael Howard <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2005-04-26">yesterday</TIMEX3> paved the way for a bitter end to the general election when the Tories launched a nationwide poster campaign explicitly condemning Tony Blair as a liar .
In an echo of the Conservatives ' notorious ` ` demon eyes '' of <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="1997">1997</TIMEX3> , the leadership unveiled a poster of a shifty - looking Mr Blair standing next to a stark message .
` ` If he 's prepared to lie to take us to war , he 's prepared to lie to win an election , '' it says in black lettering on a dark red background .
In a play on Labor 's latest message imploring people to vote for what they value , it adds : ` ` If you value the truth , vote for it . ''
Mr Howard was <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="TIME" value="2005-04-26TNI">last night</TIMEX3> unapologetic about the poster , which includes language that would be ruled out of order in the House of Commons .
` ` I ' m a very direct person .
I say it as it is , '' he said during a visit to Birmingham .
` ` Character is an issue at this election .
It is about trust . ''
At his morning press conference , Mr Howard defended his decision to describe the prime minister as a liar for three reasons : The so called ` ` dodgy dossier '' of <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2003-02">February 2003</TIMEX3> , which the prime minister claimed was based on intelligence but was in fact ` ` pulled off '' the internet ; The prime minister 's claim in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2002-09">September 2002</TIMEX3> that intelligence about Iraqi weapons of mass destruction was ` ` extensive , detailed and authoritative '' when Lord Butler depicted it in his report <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2004">last year</TIMEX3> as ` ` limited , sporadic and patchy '' ; The prime minister and Lord Goldsmith , the attorney general , had ` ` directly contradicted each other '' about advice on the legality of the Iraq war .
The poster is a gamble for Mr Howard - on the day after he admitted he was ` ` two goals down '' - because he was such an enthusiastic supporter of military action .
But he believes that voters across the spectrum , including opponents and supporters of the war , will share his belief that Iraq highlighted wider questions about the prime minister 's trustworthiness .
One aide said : ` ` Trust really is the fundamental issue .
War is the lightning conductor but he lied on top - up fees .
So Michael is saying you ca n't trust Labor on tax - because of the 66 stealth taxes - and you ca n't trust him on health because he said in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="1997">1997</TIMEX3> there was <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="P1D">24 hours</TIMEX3> to save the NHS .
Can you trust anyone who says that and then fails to deliver ? ''
Labor will have mixed feelings about the poster because the prime minister needs no reminding that anger about Iraq has made him one of the party 's main liabilities .
But Labor strategists believe the Tories ' decision to attack him in such personal terms shows Mr Howard ` ` has nothing to say '' about the voters ' main concerns on schools and hospitals .
In a sign that the Tories are embarking on a negative end to the campaign , one of Australia 's toughest political operators has flown in to help the party .
Mark Textor , who has allegedly deployed the US tactic of ` ` push polling '' to spread damaging information about opponents under the guise of questions , was photographed by the Labor party entering Tory HQ .
The Conservatives said they had never hidden the fact that Mr Textor , a business partner of the party 's Australian campaign director , Lynton Crosby , would help out .
