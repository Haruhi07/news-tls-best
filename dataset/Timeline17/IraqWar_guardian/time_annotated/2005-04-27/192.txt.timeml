The Iraq war hero Johnson Beharry , who twice saved the crew of his armored vehicle from ambushes , received the Victoria Cross <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2005-04-27">today</TIMEX3> and was told by the Queen : ` ` You 're very special . ''
Private Beharry , 25 , who is originally from the Caribbean island of Grenada , is the first person to receive Britain 's highest military honor since the Falklands war in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="1982">1982</TIMEX3> and the first living recipient of a VC since <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="1965">1965</TIMEX3> .
It is thought that his actions in Iraq saved the lives of more than 30 of his colleagues .
Speaking <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2005-04-27">today</TIMEX3> after receiving the medal at a ceremony at Buckingham Palace , Pte Beharry , of the Princess of Wales 's Royal Regiment , said the Queen had told him that ` ` she does n't get to present the VC very often '' .
Pte Beharry , from Tidworth , Hampshire , was struck by a bullet as he guided a Warrior armored convoy through the flashpoint Iraqi town of Al - Amara <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2004-05">last May</TIMEX3> .
He jumped into a hail of bullets three times to rescue injured colleagues before driving his vehicle to safety .
<TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="P1M">A month</TIMEX3> later , he saved more lives during another ferocious fire fight and suffered serious head injuries when a rocket - propelled grenade -LRB- RPG -RRB- exploded a foot away from his head .
As blood poured into his eyes , he managed to reverse his Warrior out of the ambush before he lost consciousness and went into a coma .
Still recovering from his wounds and bearing a scar across his forehead , he said <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2005-04-27">today</TIMEX3> : ` ` I know I ' m lucky to be alive .
<TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EVERY">Every day</TIMEX3> in Iraq , when I went out on patrol , I thought I would n't be coming back - then at the end of the day I thought , ` That was a lucky one . ' ''
The citation for his VC reads : ` ` For his repeated extreme gallantry and unquestioned valor , despite intense direct attacks , personal injury and damage to his vehicle in the face of relentless enemy action , Pte Beharry deserves the highest possible recognition . ''
But Pte Beharry , who was accompanied to the palace by his wife , Lynthia , and his aunt Irene and uncle Raymond , played down his bravery .
` ` When I hear what I did , I ca n't really believe it was me .
But what I did was my choice - I knew I had to get everyone out because I would n't have been able to live with myself otherwise .
I think it 's the training that just kicks in , '' he said .
He said celebrations had been put on hold during his recovery .
` ` There 's too much happening at the moment , '' he said .
` ` I never dreamt this would happen to me ; I never thought I 'd meet so many important people .
` ` I ' m still receiving treatment for my injuries - I ' m getting physio and seeing specialists - so I ' m limited in what I can do .
I hope to return to service
but I do n't know when that will be
and I would go back to Iraq if I had to . ''
Pte Beharry was joined at <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2005-04-27">today</TIMEX3> 's ceremony by around 140 other British troops awarded honors for their service around the world .
His commanding officers , Lieutenant Colonel Matthew Maer and Major James Coote , received the Distinguished Service Order for their leadership during the campaign .
` ` Pte Beharry 's actions were superb , '' said Lt Col Maer .
` ` The VC is hard won and he is following in a long and distinguished line of people awarded the honor .
All of us , in the army and the nation , should be proud of him .
And we should be proud of all the other recipients of honors won in Iraq - they reflect a team effort . ''
Pte Beharry moved to the UK from Grenada in <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="1999">1999</TIMEX3> and worked as a painter and decorator before becoming a British soldier in <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2001">2001</TIMEX3> .
He is one of a growing number of troops recruited into the army from the Commonwealth .
He is the first to be awarded the VC since Lieutenant Colonel H Jones and Sergeant Ian McKay received posthumous awards after the Falklands war against Argentina .
<TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2005-04-27">Today</TIMEX3> Pte Beharry outranked Britain 's top soldier , General Sir Michael Jackson , for the day .
The junior soldier 's investiture took precedence to the general 's who received the honor of Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath .
When news of Pte Beharry 's VC was announced in <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2005-03">March</TIMEX3> , Sir Michael said he had never felt more proud of the British army .
Meanwhile , Ellen MacArthur , who broke the record for sailing solo around the world in <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2005-02">February</TIMEX3> , became Dame Ellen .
At 28 , the yachtswoman is the youngest person to receive the honor .
Actress Anna Massey collected a CBE - invested as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire - for services to drama .
