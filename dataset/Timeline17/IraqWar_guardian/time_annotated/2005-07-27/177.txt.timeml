<TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2005-07-27">Wednesday</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2005-07-27">27 July 2005</TIMEX3> 23.59 BST It was so attractive that the people of Lille were already flocking to it , months before the official opening : two hectares of green grass , 250 shady chestnut and lime trees , fountains and a children 's play area , all bang in the middle of France 's biggest and busiest northern city .
Sadly , the brand - new Parc Jean - Baptiste Lebas is <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> firmly closed , its perimeter fence patrolled by watchful policemen while a mine clearance team more used to working in Bosnia , Afghanistan and Iraq finishes ridding it of a potentially deadly crop of first world war grenades .
So far they have found some 200 .
` ` Thankfully no one has been hurt , but obviously we have to to take every possible precaution , '' said a city hall official .
` ` There is no question of anyone else being allowed in again until we are sure it 's safe . ''
The scare started <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2005-07">this month</TIMEX3> when the parents of a four - year - old boy found him playing with a lemon - sized lump of hardened earth which , on closer inspection , turned out to be a German Heer Handgranat dating from <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="1915">1915</TIMEX3> , containing 30 grams -LRB- 1
oz -RRB- of unstable explosive , and capable of maiming anyone within a 25 - metre radius .
Gardeners and building workers on the site next to the city hall began hunting for more with rakes , at first with little success .

But then a park visitor stumbled across another one , and ` ` quite suddenly , a whole bunch came to the surface after some heavy rainfall '' , the official said .
The town hall called in a Toulouse - based demining company .
Using advanced metal detectors , the company , Geomines , has spent <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P5D">five days</TIMEX3> inching across the new park , until <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> a five - lane boulevard and car park , uncovering first eight , then 23 , then 70 , then 96 and finally 189 of the grenades , some twisted by earthmovers that had , miraculously , failed to set them off .
ISS Espaces Verts , the contractors , told the local newspaper La Voix du Nord that after a painstaking inquiry it had come to the conclusion that of the tens of thousands of tonnes of soil it had trucked in to create the park , a portion came from the villages of Santes , Loos and Wambrechies - through which , for <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="PXM">many months</TIMEX3> , ran the frontline of the <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="1914">1914</TIMEX3> - <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="1918">18</TIMEX3> war .
` ` We ' ve been lucky , '' the city hall official said .
The people of Lille are used to such scares : <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2002">three years ago</TIMEX3> , more than a thousand were evacuated when workers uncovered a 110 kg British bomb buried on the site of the new regional council building .
