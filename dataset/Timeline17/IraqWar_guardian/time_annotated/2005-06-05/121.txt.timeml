A second British soldier could face charges over the death of an Iraqi civilian as senior army commanders brace themselves for damaging new revelations about army behavior in Iraq .
A formal military hearing on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2005-06-10">Friday</TIMEX3> will consider evidence against Lance Corporal Barry Singleton , 23 , following an investigation into claims that he fired his gun 12 times at a driver who tried to speed through a checkpoint .

A decision on whether to press charges , which could include murder , against Singleton could coincide with an announcement to Parliament by the government 's most senior lawyer , Lord Goldsmith , that as many as 11 soldiers will be charged in connection with the death of another Iraqi civilian .
Goldsmith 's statement could include charges levelled against a British commanding officer over the death of a 26 - year - old Iraqi civilian , a move that would prove highly embarrassing to the Army .
Lieutenant Colonel Jorge Mendonca , 41 , CO of the Queen 's Lancashire Regiment , is among the servicemen investigated over the death of Baha Mousa , a hotel receptionist in Basra .
Singleton was on duty in Basra with the King 's Own Scottish Borderers in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2003-08">August 2003</TIMEX3> when the shooting at the checkpoint occurred <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P3M">three months</TIMEX3> before the regiment 's tour of duty ended .
<TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2005-W22">This week</TIMEX3> 's preliminary hearing of military lawyers will evaluate the strength of the evidence surrounding the case and what , if any , charges will be brought against Singleton .
It is understood that even if he does not face a murder charge , manslaughter may be an option .
The news comes as human rights lawyers prepare to apply for a judicial review of events surrounding Camp Breadbasket , the humanitarian food depot near Basra and from where pictures of British troops abusing Iraqis were published during a court martial <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2005" mod="START">earlier this year</TIMEX3> .
The legal challenge was discussed <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2005-W21">last week</TIMEX3> between Phil Shiner , of the Public Interest Lawyers practice , and human rights lawyer Ben Emmerson QC , who represented Katherine Gun , the former GCHQ translator accused of leaking details of an American ` dirty tricks ' operation to spy on the United Nations .
Shiner wants his allegations that British troops were involved in ` systematic torture ' to be investigated .
He has already secured a first judicial review into whether an independent inquiry should be held into the death of Mousa , who died in custody in <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2003-09">September 2003</TIMEX3> .
The High Court heard that British soldiers used hooded Iraqi civilians as kickboxing targets , forced them to dance ` like Michael Jackson ' and beat one detainee for <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="P3D">three days</TIMEX3> until he died .
Charges so far brought against British troops include seven paratroopers charged with the murder of an Iraqi civilian ; their trial is scheduled for <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2004-09">September</TIMEX3> .
Lawyers for the men have claimed that the prosecution ` is full of holes ' and that the soldiers are victims of a ` culture of prosecution and political correctness ' .
Army officers have so far investigated 167 allegations of abuse in Iraq .
Saddam Hussein 's morale has collapsed as he has realized the gravity of the charges against him , the head of Iraq 's special tribunal said <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2005-06-04">yesterday</TIMEX3> .
The former dictator 's defiance at a court hearing <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2004">last year</TIMEX3> has turned to despondency over accusations of mass murder and war crimes , said Raid Juhi , the judge who will try him .
` He understands the extent of the charges and that he will stand trial before an impartial court , ' he told the London - based Asharq al - Awsat newspaper .
