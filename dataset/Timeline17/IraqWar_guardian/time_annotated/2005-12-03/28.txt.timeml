John Gray , academic , writer and public intellectual , was an unlikely Thatcherite , then an early Blairite .
He is <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> the scourge of neocons and the disciples of science and rationalism
If you had to fit the message of John Gray 's 14 books and innumerable articles on a sandwich board , it would be simple : you 're all doomed .
Quite who is doomed , and why , has varied with the development of his thought .
He started off as a Thatcherite and cold warrior , convinced that the postwar consensus and welfare state could not last .
Then he became an early Blairite , warning against the dangers of Thatcherism .
<TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> he attacks Blair as a dangerous neocon ; he has been an unyielding opponent of the Iraq war and he is convinced that globalisation will end in a welter of resource wars and ecological collapse .
Peter Wilby , a former editor of the New Statesman who published him for <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P3Y">three years</TIMEX3> , says : ` ` He 's one of life 's sceptics , really .
Any kind of ideology - the more he looks at it , the more he decides that it crumbles apart .
None of the emperors has any clothes so far as John is concerned . ''
In all this , he sees himself as consistent .
As a polemicist he has always argued against the conventional wisdom , and usually been <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P5Y" mod="APPROX">about five years</TIMEX3> ahead of it .
As a political philosopher , he believes he has always had a guiding principle : that there are certain limits on human life which politics can never abolish , and never wholly work around .
Utopian or universal schemes will only make things worse .
This sounds like conservatism ; but he also believes that real , reactionary conservatism is no longer possible : ` ` The right <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2005-12-03">today</TIMEX3> likes to imagine that it is the voice of the past .

In truth ...
the fate of the right in the late modern age is to destroy what remains of the past in a vain attempt to recover it . ''
Gray was born in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="1947">1947</TIMEX3> into a world which the market has quite swept away : the working class of Tyneside , when they still had jobs .
His father was a shipyard joiner in South Shields .
They never thought of themselves as poor , he says ; others remember it differently .

His childhood friend Robert Colls , <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> a historian at the University of Leicester , who grew up in the same part of town , remembers ` ` this poor brilliant boy living in a mixed area of town .
His dad was disabled in his 50s .
I think he had a hard time on the money front . ''
In <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="1968">1968</TIMEX3> , he went up to Oxford to read PPE on a scholarship .
Isaiah Berlin was at Oxford then , working on the most subtle and powerful justification for liberalism that anyone managed in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="19">the 20th century</TIMEX3> ; Gray , who became a friend , set out to overthrow it .
Liberalism , said Berlin , is valuable because it lets people live in many different ways , seeking many different goals .

But no one society , Gray objects , can encompass all the humanly fulfilling ways to live .
Russia under totalitarianism\/communism was in some respects less materialistic and more respectful of culture than it is <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> , but these virtues were made possible only by a dreadful tyranny .
His arguments on this topic are pitched in academic prose , but they can be boiled down into one line of Mick Jagger 's :
We ca n't get no satisfaction .
We are not the sort of creatures who could get lasting satisfaction , not just because we often want bad things instead of good ones , but because the goods we want ca n't be reconciled with each other .

The Australian philosopher George Crowder claims that Gray must logically endorse Stalin and Hitler as offering legitimate models of society , something Gray cheerfully denies .
The fact that our values , though real , are sometimes incompatible does n't mean they have nothing in common .
It must be possible , he claims , to build some kind of minimal universal moral framework , even if this does not lead to liberalism : ` ` No society can be called good which rests on torture . ''
His pessimistic twist on Berlin is also part of the rootless conservatism which has made him denounce the projects of the right as passionately as he denounced Marxism .
He believes that human life can always be made better , but that this process does not approach perfection .
New problems are always arising ; old gains can easily be lost .
There is no steady ladder of progress ; but we are able , sometimes , to run up the down escalator .
He rejects the idea that political debate starts from human rights .
The process seems to him the other way round : that ` ` rights '' are something that emerge from a political process , and different rights may be produced under different political systems .
None is inherent in all human beings , and the ones that we do recognize may conflict with each other .
When they do so , we ca n't honestly resolve the problem by logic which everyone comes to accept , nor even , as Americans do , by handing the matter over to a Supreme Court .
The final decision , says Gray , must be political .
As a working - class undergraduate , he was a Thatcherite before Thatcher herself , a believer in the market , and a critic of planned economies .
He read Hayek in <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="196" mod="END">the late 1960s</TIMEX3> , and understood his essential point to be that markets in some sense know more than any of the people who operate in them .
It followed that state planning , and social engineering based on rational discussion were always likely to go wrong .
This much was common among Thatcherites in <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="197">the 70s</TIMEX3> , but unlike most Thatcherites , he saw that ripping down communities to make way for a market was itself a form of social engineering , though an often anti - social one .
` ` Give him any collection of pigeons and he 'll set a cat among them , '' says his friend the academic and publisher Henry Hardy .
Gray 's views on council - house sales are a good example of his contrarian style - and of his appetite for anchoring large arguments in historical detail .
The sale of council houses , he said , might have been good for the Conservative party in the short term , but it did nothing to decrease dependency on the state , as it was supposed to do .
All it changed was the form of subsidy .
` ` Spending on housing benefit during <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="1996">1996</TIMEX3> - <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="1967">67</TIMEX3> was over 10 times the total cost of housing benefits in <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="1979">1979</TIMEX3> - <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="1980">80</TIMEX3> .
Public expenditure on social housing was replaced , many times over , by rent rebates and assistance with the payment of mortgages .
The price of privatising municipal housing in Britain has been a colossal increase in welfare dependency . ''
This kind of inconsistency in Thatcherism led to his conversion to Blairism .
As a Blairite in the days before there was a Blair government , he started to attack the costs of the free market : ` ` In the United States free markets have contributed to social breakdown on a scale unknown in any other developed country .
Families are weaker in America than in any other country .
At the same time , social order has been propped up by a policy of mass incarceration .
No other advanced industrial country , aside from post - communist Russia , uses imprisonment as a means of social control on the scale of the United States .
Free markets , the desolation of families and communities and the use of the sanctions of criminal law as a last recourse against social collapse go in tandem . ''
Thatcherism was not just a local phenomenon .
It was also recognized as a global symbol , and this was the next symbol against which he charged .
Nothing could be more alien to his temperament than <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="199">the 90s</TIMEX3> ' bland optimism that history was over and the whole world must converge , with greater or lesser success , on the model of the United States of America .
For one thing , he argued , globalisation depends on the world being different .
If it were all the same , there would be no reason to invest in one part of it rather than another .
The vast , destabilising currency markets take as their premise the inequalities between nations , and then act to enlarge them , not to bring countries together .
The spread of technology was inevitable and irreversible .

But there was no reason to suppose that the spread of American technology meant the spread of American models of society ; and the examples of countries that had successfully enriched themselves with modern technology , such as Japan , shows that their differences from western models were essential to their success .
Although he was prolific - 12 books - and successful , Gray was little known outside academic circles until <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="199" mod="MID">the mid-90s</TIMEX3> .
His first post , at the University of East Anglia , had been succeeded by a job at Jesus College , Oxford , where he remained for <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DURATION" value="P15Y" mod="LESS_THAN">nearly 15 years</TIMEX3> .
He held visiting professorships at Harvard and Yale .
His writing has always had a chameleon quality .
When he writes about Berlin his sentences stretch and then tangle and convolute like brain cells .
When he writes about his favorite philosopher , the Spanish aphorist Santayana , his own style becomes elegant and precise .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="1998">1998</TIMEX3> he moved to the LSE , as professor of European thought , and in <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="2000">2000</TIMEX3> he published Straw Dogs , with Granta , rather than Routledge , which marked his breakthrough as a public intellectual .
It is written in a wrought - up , aphoristic style .
` ` When will the Jews be forgiven the Holocaust ? ''
he asks at one stage .
But it was very widely and respectfully reviewed .
His view of the world cut through the antidepressant euphoria of <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="199">the 90s</TIMEX3> with a sense of a much nastier future ahead .
In Straw Dogs , his pessimism became truly global , and entangled with environmentalism .
The hubris which he had been denouncing all his life , first in socialism , then in neo - liberalism , was <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> identified with the notion of growth .
Just as before , nemesis was to be supplied by nature .
But this time it was not human nature that would ensure our doom , but nature itself .
Since then , a series of short , punchy books has kept up with the troubles of the age .
His essays for the New Statesman are being republished as Heresies with a characteristic subtitle : Against Progress and Other Illusions .
His fiercest scorn has switched to the disciples of rationalism and of science : ` ` Of all modern delusions , the idea that we live in a secular age is the furthest from reality ...
liberal humanism itself is very obviously a religion - a shoddy replica of Christian faith markedly more irrational than the original article , and in <TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> times more harmful . ''
