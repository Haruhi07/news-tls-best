As the US army faces what ` ` may be the toughest recruiting environment ever '' is it is upping its spending on recruitment <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2006">next year</TIMEX3> to $ 320 m up from $ 240 m .
This amounts to $ 4,000 per recruit if the army signs up 80,000 <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2006">next year</TIMEX3> .
<TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2005-07">July</TIMEX3> proved to a good month for the US army 's recruitment target .
This branch of the US armed forces has struggled to meet its recruitment targets but <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2005-07">last month</TIMEX3> it signed up 8,085 new recruits , beating its target of 7,450 .
Still , when the army finishes its financial year on <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2005-09-30">30 September</TIMEX3> it is expected to be 7,000 short of its 80,000 recruiting goal .
With public support for the war in Iraq steadily dropping , the army chief of staff , General Peter Schoomaker , tells the San Francisco Chronicle that <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2006">next year</TIMEX3> ` ` may be the toughest recruiting environment ever . ''
That 's no surprise when the army is up against the likes of Cindy Sheehan , who is camped outside George Bush 's Texas ranch in protest at the death of her son in Iraq .
Media coverage of returning casualties from Iraq , such as this powerful piece in the Washington Post does the US army no favors either .
Given this unpromising context , Business Week reports that the army will spend more money on recruitment ads <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2006">next year</TIMEX3> , about $ 320 m up from $ 240 m <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2005">this year</TIMEX3> .
As it helpfully points out this amounts to $ 4,000 per recruit if the army signs up 80,000 <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2006">next year</TIMEX3> - more than twice what Toyota spends to woo a new customer .
As part of this marketing drive , the army has plans for 15 televised town hall meetings in which carefully selected soldiers will put a positive spin on the US presence in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Meanwhile TV ads will target parents with one featuring a mother 's voice - over : ` ` Thanks for bringing the best out the best in my child . ''
For those keeping tabs on the Pentagon 's recruitment efforts , the CounterRecruiter website , a project of the Indypendent , the newspaper of the New York City Independent Media Center , provides useful information , including the army 's controversial attempts to recruit from schools and universities .

Yet while the army struggles to fill its ranks , this appears not to be the case with the navy , air force and Marines .
According to Strategy Page , a site specialising on military issues as its name indicates , the army seems to be having trouble attracting those applicants who were unable to get into the other services .
James Dunnigan , the editor in chief of Strategy Page , also notes that the army is having no trouble getting people who have served in Iraq to re - enlist .
By the end of the year , the army expects to get 4,000 more re - enlistments than it expected , he writes .
Yet even he does not deny that the army is having trouble getting new recruits .
Given the situation , any idea of sending US troops to Iran must fill the army with dread .
