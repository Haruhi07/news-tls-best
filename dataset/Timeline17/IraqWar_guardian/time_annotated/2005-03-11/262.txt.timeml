<TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2005-03-11">Friday</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2005-03-11">11 March 2005</TIMEX3> 01.52 GMT Experts in public health from six countries , including the UK , <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2005-03-11">today</TIMEX3> castigate the British and American governments for failing to investigate the deaths of civilians caught up in the conflict in Iraq .
Twenty - four experts from the UK , the US , Australia , Canada , Spain and Italy say the attitude of the governments is ` ` wholly irresponsible '' .
They say the UK government 's reliance on ` ` extremely limited data '' from the Iraqi ministry of health is ` ` unacceptable '' because it is likely to seriously underestimate the casualties .
Their hard - hitting statement , published online by the British Medical Journal , comes <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P5M" mod="LESS_THAN">nearly five months</TIMEX3> after the Lancet published a household survey of civilian deaths in Iraq which estimated that about 100,000 civilians had died - most of them women and children .
The study caused controversy and was dismissed by the British government as unreliable , partly because the authors admitted that , under the difficult circumstances , it could not be precise .
The experts lambast the government for criticising the data without conducting inquiries of its own .
` ` The obvious answer to removing uncertainties that remain is to commission a larger study with full official support and assistance , but scientific independence , '' they say .
` ` Counting casualties can help to save lives both <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> and in the future by helping us to understand the burden of death , and residual burden of injury , disease and trauma across the entire population , '' the experts say .
` ` We have waited too long for this information . ''
The Iraqi ministry of health data is not complete .
Among the reasons for this are that only violence - related deaths reported through the health system are counted and deaths in the first <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">12 months</TIMEX3> of the conflict are not included .
Among the 10 experts from the UK who have signed the statement are Klim McPherson , visiting professor of public health epidemiology at Oxford University , David Hunter , chair of the UK Public Health Association , and Sian Griffiths , immediate past - president of the faculty of public health at the Royal College of Physicians .
There are seven eminent physicians from the US , three from Australia , two from Spain and one each from Canada and Italy .
` ` Monitoring casualties is a humanitarian imperative , '' they say .
` ` Understanding the causes of death is a core public health responsibility , nationally and internationally .
Yet neither the public , nor we as public health professionals , are able to obtain validated , reliable information about the extent of mortality and morbidity since the invasion of Iraq . ''
In a commentary in the BMJ , Professor McPherson says that public access to reliable figures is important .
` ` The policy being assessed - the allied invasion of Iraq - was justified largely on grounds of democratic supremacy .
Voters in the countries that initiated the war and others - not least in Iraq itself - are denied a reliable evaluation of a key indicator of the success of that policy .
This is unacceptable . ''
Understanding the burden of death , disease , injury and trauma aids the proper planning of war and health and will help governments assess the humanitarian implications of conflict , he says .
` ` The plain fact is that an estimate of 100,000 excess deaths attributable to the invasion of Iraq is alarming .
That is already half the death toll of Hiroshima .
Apart from the practical arguments , the principled ones stand and will always stand .
Have we not learned any lessons from the history of sweeping alarming numbers of deaths under the carpet ?
This is not something about which there can be any political discretion <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="P60Y">60 years</TIMEX3> after Auschwitz . ''
The Foreign Office said <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2005-03-10">yesterday</TIMEX3> it believed the figures from the Iraqi ministry of health were the most reliable because they were based on head counts not extrapolation .
