Speaking ahead of a press conference <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2005-01-19">today</TIMEX3> , Lance Corporal George Solomou , from the London regiment of the Territorial Army , said : ` ` I am not going to Iraq , point - blank .
I am a conscientious objector to this war , and I am going to see how the army plays it from there .
I would rather spend <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> in prison than <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="PT1M">a minute</TIMEX3> in Iraq as part of an illegal war . ''
He spoke out as the Ministry of Defense said it was unable to provide details of serious injuries sustained by 790 British troops evacuated since the invasion of Iraq .
Their injuries were as a result of ` ` hostile actions , accidents , and other incidents '' , Ivor Caplin , the junior defense minister , told MPs <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2005-01" mod="START">earlier this month</TIMEX3> .
Mr Solomou describes an atmosphere of restlessness over Iraq in the increasingly deployed reservist TA , saying : ` ` I want to act as a beacon for other soldiers to come out and say they are against the war , or at least that they are not prepared to go .
There are so many more soldiers out there who believe what I believe .
` ` I have always wanted to be a soldier and I still want to be a soldier , '' he added .
` ` But I want to be used in the correct manner .
We are not just pieces of flesh to be moved about on a chessboard . ''
Mr Solomou , 38 , a worker for the emergency services in east London , said he had always opposed the war in Iraq , and had marched against it in <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2003-02">February 2003</TIMEX3> with a group of TA colleagues .
Citing his objections <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2005-01-18">yesterday</TIMEX3> , he said : ` ` I believe the occupation of Iraq to be illegal .
They have tried everything - weapons of mass destruction , the connection to al - Qaida - none of it was true .
` ` <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> the fundamental bedrocks of democracy are being trampled by this war , with the American treatment of prisoners .
Added to that , the Iraqis can see oil tanker after oil tanker coming out of Iraq while they have n't even got electricity .
This war is a turning point in history and is about America setting itself on a course to control the world 's petroleum . ''
Mr Solomou started his TA career as an infantryman , but transferred to the Royal Army Medical Corps attached to the London Irish Rifles .
He will present his case at a press conference at Westminster <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2005-01-19">today</TIMEX3> , convened by Military Families Against the War , and led by Rose Gentle from Glasgow , whose 19 - year - old son Gordon was killed in Iraq in <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2004-06">June last year</TIMEX3> .
Most of the 790 injuries sustained by British service personnel since <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2003-03">March 2003</TIMEX3> were caused by shrapnel , defense sources suggested <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2005-01-18">yesterday</TIMEX3> .
The MoD said it could not give any further information .
It is known that a number have had limbs amputated .
They include two Royal Signals soldiers who lost their legs in a suicide bomber attack on the Black Watch battlegroup south of Baghdad in <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2004-11">November</TIMEX3> .
Seveny - three members of the armed forces have been killed in Iraq , more than half the result of accidents and , in at least one case , suicide , according to the latest MoD figures on fatalities .
Mr Caplin also told MPs <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2005-01" mod="START">earlier this month</TIMEX3> that there are about 400 British military medical personnel in Iraq , including surgeons , dentists , physiotherapists and mental health specialists .
In separate parliamentary answers , the Foreign Office minister , Bill Rammell , said the government had ` ` no reliable of ascertaining the number of Iraqi civilians injured by military or terrorist action '' since <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="2003-05">May 2003</TIMEX3> .
But he said that according to the Iraqi health minister , figures based on records from some 180 hospitals , showed that between <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="2004-04">April</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t36" type="DATE" value="2004-10">October last year</TIMEX3> 15,517 Iraqi civilians were injured , and 3,853 killed .
