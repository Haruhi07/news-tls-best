` Crazy ' Iraqi spy was full of misinformation , says report <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2005-04-03">Sunday</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2005-04-03">3 April 2005</TIMEX3> 02.26
BST An alcoholic cousin of an aide to Ahmed Chalabi has emerged as the key source in the US rationale for going to war in Iraq .
According to a US presidential commission looking into pre - war intelligence failures , the basis for pivotal intelligence on Iraq 's alleged biological weapons programs and fleet of mobile labs was a spy described as ` crazy ' by his intelligence handlers and a ` congenital liar ' by his friends .
The defector , given the code - name Curveball by the CIA , has emerged as the central figure in the corruption of US intelligence estimates on Iraq .
Despite considerable doubts over Curveball 's credibility , his claims were included in the administration 's case for war without caveat .
According to the report , the failure of US spy agencies to scrutinise his claims are the ` primary reason ' that they ` fundamentally misjudged the status of Iraq 's -LRB- biological weapons -RRB- programs ' .
The catalogue of failures and the gullibility of US intelligence make for darkly comic reading , even by the standards of failure detailed in previous investigations .
Of all the disproven pre - war weapons claims , from aluminium centrifuge tubes to yellow cake uranium from Niger , none points to greater levels of incompetence than those found within the misadventures of Curveball .
The Americans never had direct access to Curveball - he was controlled by the German intelligence services who passed his reports on to the Defense Intelligence Agency , the Pentagon 's spy agency .
Between <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2000-01">January 2000</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2001-09">September 2001</TIMEX3> , Curveball offered 100 reports , among them the claims of mobile biological weapons labs that were central in the US evidence of an illicit weapons program , but subsequently turned out to be trucks equipped with machinery to make helium for weather balloons .
The commission concluded that Curveball 's information was worse than none at all .
` Worse than having no human sources , ' it said , ` is being seduced by a human source who is telling lies . '
Although the defector has never been formally identified , it appears he was an Iraqi chemical engineer who defected after UN inspectors left the country in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="1998">1998</TIMEX3> .
In the aftermath of the US - led invasion , Iraqis whom Curveball claimed were co - workers in Saddam 's alleged biological weapons program did not know who he was .
He claimed he 'd witnessed a deadly biological weapons accident when he was not even in Iraq when it was meant to have happened .
After <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2001-09">September 2001</TIMEX3> , his claims were given greater credibility despite the fact that he was not in Iraq at the time he claimed to have taken part in illicit weapons work .
His information was central to an <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2002-10">October 2002</TIMEX3> National Intelligence Estimate that concluded Iraq ` has ' biological weapons , and was widely used by President Bush and Dick Cheney to make their case for war .
It <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> appears there were problems with Curveball from the start , but the intelligence community was willing to believe him ` because the tales he told were consistent with what they already believed . '
In <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2000-05">May 2000</TIMEX3> doubts about his credibility surfaced when he was examined for signs that he had been exposed to biological agents .
While the results were inconclusive , a US official was surprised to find Curveball had a hangover and said he ` might be an alcoholic . '
By <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2001" mod="START">early 2001</TIMEX3> , the Germans were having doubts of their own , telling the CIA their spy was ` out of control ' .
But warnings were dismissed .
Intelligence analysts who voiced concern were ` forced to leave ' the unit mainly responsible for analyzing his claims , the commission found .
At every turn analysts were blocked by spy chiefs and their warning never passed on to policy - makers .
The commission 's report is unlikely to renew confidence in America 's intelligence network as it attempts to uncover evidence of WMDs in Iran and elsewhere .
The report concludes that US intelligence agencies remain poorly coordinated , have resisted reform and produce ` irrelevant ' work .
Dozens of insurgents attacked Abu Ghraib prison outside Baghdad <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2005-04-02">yesterday</TIMEX3> , detonating two suicide car bombs and firing rocket - propelled grenades at US forces before the assault was repelled .
At least 20 US soldiers and 12 detainees were wounded in the fighting , which lasted <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DURATION" value="PT1H">around an hour</TIMEX3> .
