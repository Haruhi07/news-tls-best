As casualties soar , America 's women face reality of front line Joanna Walters reports from New York on how Iraq is changing the face of warfare <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2005-05-01">Sunday</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2005-05-01">1 May 2005</TIMEX3> 02.34 BST Facing the highest ever casualty rate for servicewomen in its history , America is considering making official what is already a reality - allowing women to fight on the front line in war .
The ground war in Iraq has made the historical tradition of not having women in combat unworkable .
A total of 35 US servicewomen have <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> died in Iraq and 271 have been injured .
It is a small percentage of the 1,500 US service personnel fatalities and the 11,600 wounded , but these women are being killed and injured under enemy fire .
<TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2005-04-28">Three days ago</TIMEX3> army private Sam Huff was buried with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery .
She was 18 and died on <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2005-04-18">18 April</TIMEX3> when her convoy was blown up by a roadside bomb .
` Beneath that beautiful young lady was a backbone of steel , ' her sergeant , Sam Jones , wrote in a letter read aloud at her hometown funeral in Tucson , Arizona .
Huff 's parents reluctantly let her join the army when she was 16 and she quickly gained a reputation for enthusiasm and grit .
` She 's the bravest kid I ' ve ever known , ' said her father , Robert Huff .
` She was up and down that damned road between Baghdad and the airport , which is notorious for improvised explosive devices .

But she knew the risks and believed in the mission . '
Dawn Halfaker was arguably more fortunate than Huff .
The 25 - year - old Californian is home from Iraq <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> and has been spending time before attending post - graduate college snowboarding and playing basketball - with one arm .
She had already been in firefights and had killed insurgents when she went on a routine reconnaissance patrol with her military police platoon in Baquoba one night <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2004">last year</TIMEX3> .
They were ambushed and a rocket - propelled grenade screamed into her armored vehicle .
It tore off the arm of Sergeant Norberto Lara , sending the limb flying into the driver 's lap , then exploded at Halfaker 's shoulder , blasting her head and arm .
Medics kept her alive until they reached a base , where her last words before passing out were : ` You bastards better not cut my arm off . '
She woke up an amputee , dreams of becoming a professional basketball player as shattered as her body .

But she has no regrets about being a soldier in a modern war zone .
` Woman in combat is not really an issue .
It is happening , ' she said .
Fighting insurgents across Iraq makes for a chaotic battlefield .
` Everyone pretty much acknowledges there are no rear battle areas , no forward line of troops , ' said Halfaker .
Four women died under enemy fire in the Gulf war , where female troops made headlines flying combat aircraft , driving supply trucks close to the front lines and being taken as prisoners of war .
Eight servicewomen died during the Vietnam war - all nurses - and hundreds have died in previous conflicts , but as auxiliary troops or medics serving far to the rear , succumbing most often to disease and accidents .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="1994">1994</TIMEX3> Bill Clinton opened up 90 per cent of military jobs to women .
But although that meant they could officially go into combat by air and by sea , they were and still are barred from units that go on the offensive on land , including the general infantry , the marines and the special forces , and from units that accompany those troops .
Army documents have <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> surfaced , however , recommending a lifting of the ban on women in units serving alongside other units that primarily go into combat .
Officials say it is no more than a discussion document at this stage , others say it is the first step towards sanctioning women in land combat .
` The government will probably not deal with this until the Iraq conflict is over , otherwise , if it went the wrong way , they could face having to pull the women out of Iraq who are there <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> , who are de facto in combat , ' said Lory Manning , a retired navy captain and director of the Centre For Women in Uniform in Washington DC .
Women are firing missiles from helicopters , but are not yet going on the offensive on the ground in Iraq , Manning said .
But they are returning fire in ways never seen before .
Paratrooper Kellie McCoy of St Louis , Missouri , has just returned to Iraq after a break following her award of a bronze star with a rare ` V ' for valor .
McCoy , 29 , was only on her third day in Iraq <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2004-09">last September</TIMEX3> when her convoy ran into an ambush during the attack on Falluja .
She cranked out machine - gun rounds until she had killed enough of the enemy to break through and escape , rescuing others on the way .
` Captain McCoy willingly and repeatedly took action to gather up her soldiers under enemy fire and direct fire at the enemy , ' her citation stated .
` Her actions inspired her men to accomplish the mission and saved the lives of her fellow soldiers . '
Such tributes , and they are few but not isolated , rebuff the myth that men ca n't go to war with women because sexual tensions or their urge to protect them will sink morale .

And the argument that the public would not stand for news of servicewomen coming home in coffins has not been borne out .
Women are being awarded bronze stars and record numbers are receiving the booby prize of the wounded , the Purple Heart .
One such is Major Ladda Duckworth , the most severely wounded of five female amputees in rehab at Walter Reed Army Hospital .
The Black Hawk pilot lost both legs and a huge chunk of one arm when her helicopter was shot down .
Staff were shocked when she was brought in . '
I think they had not seen a female that badly mutilated , ' said 37 - year - old Duckworth , from Illinois .
<TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> all she wants is to fly again and says she joined the ranks because ' I wanted to take the same risks as the guys . '

But Elaine Donnelly , president of the Centre for Military Readiness in Washington , still argues that : ` The concept of equality does not fit in combat environments .
The nation has got used to the idea of women dying in combat , and I do n't think that 's a good thing . '
Manning points out that no one wants to see combat casualties of either gender and says none of the deaths in Iraq is justified - because the war itself is not .
` But if you are going to fight wars , women have to be there , and they have shown how tough they can be when they need to be , ' she added .
