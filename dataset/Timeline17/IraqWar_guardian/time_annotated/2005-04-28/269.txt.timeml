<TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2005-04-28">Thursday</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2005-04-28">28 April 2005</TIMEX3> 13.03 BST The head of the United Nations weapons inspectors in the run - up to the Iraq war , Hans Blix , <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="TIME" value="2005-04-27TNI">last night</TIMEX3> undercut one of the main grounds offered by the attorney general , Lord Goldsmith , in his legal advice to Tony Blair .
Lord Goldsmith said there would have to be evidence that Iraq was not complying with the inspectors .

But Mr Blix , who has since retired to Sweden , said his inspectors found no compelling evidence that Iraq had a hidden arsenal or was blocking the work of the inspectors .
He said there had been only small infractions by Iraq .
` ` We did express ourselves in dry terms but there was no mistake about the content , '' he said .
` ` One can not say there was compelling evidence .
Iraq was guilty only of small infractions .
The government should have re - evaluated its assessment in the light of what the inspectors found .
` ` We reported consistently that we found no weapons of mass destruction and I carried out inspections at sites given to us by US and British intelligence and not found anything . ''
In a key passage in the legal advice written by Lord Goldsmith on <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2003-03-07">March 7 2003</TIMEX3> , the attorney general said that UN resolution 1441 could only be sustainable as a justification for war ` ` if there are strong factual grounds for concluding that Iraq has failed to take the final opportunity .
In other words , we would need to be able to demonstrate hard evidence of non - compliance and non - cooperation . ''
He said the views of Unmovic , the UN inspectorate body , and the International Atomic Energy Agency , the UN nuclear watchdog , will be ` ` highly significant '' and ` ` you will need to consider very carefully whether the evidence of non - cooperation and non - compliance by Iraq is sufficiently compelling '' .
Mr Blix and his team returned to Iraq in <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2002-12">December 2002</TIMEX3> after a four - year absence and remained until the week before war began in <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2003-03">March 2003</TIMEX3> .
More than 200 inspectors crisscrossed Iraq , checking out possible sites for the production or stockpiling of weapons of mass destruction : chemical , biological or nuclear .
Mr Blix 's first <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="SET" value="XXXX-XX">monthly</TIMEX3> report to the UN security council in <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2005-01">January</TIMEX3> was mainly negative about the Iraqi government , complaining about lack of cooperation .
<TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DURATION" value="P1M">A month</TIMEX3> later he adopted a more neutral stance , pointing out some infringements but finding no significant stockpiles .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2005-03-07">March 7</TIMEX3> , the day Lord Goldsmith drew up his report , Mr Blix gave his final report and this was the most favourable yet from Iraq 's point of view .
Asked if this final report amounted to the compelling evidence that Lord Goldsmith considered crucial , Mr Blix said : ` ` One can not say so .
There were infractions , you can say .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2005-03">March</TIMEX3> , they -LRB- the Iraqis -RRB- cooperated like hell .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2005-12">December</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2005-01">January</TIMEX3> , no . .
That is why I gave a critical account on <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2005-01-27">January 27</TIMEX3> .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="2005-02">February</TIMEX3> , it was more balanced . ''
On <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="2005-03-07">March 7</TIMEX3> , Mr Blix pleaded for more time to complete his mission and reported that lethal weapons such as Samoud 2 missiles were being destroyed .
Mr Blix said <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="TIME" value="2005-04-27TNI">last night</TIMEX3> : ` ` The things found were all small things .
We found dozens of munitions for chemical weapons .
They were empty and in a site declared .
In relation to Samoud that went beyond 150 kilometres , they -LRB- the US and Britain -RRB- said it was beyond the permitted limit
but I did not feel particularly indignant about that . ''
On <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DATE" value="2005-04-27">the same day</TIMEX3> , the head of the IAEA , Mohamed ElBaradei , reported that there was no evidence that Saddam Hussein had any nuclear weapons or was in the process of acquiring them .
Mr Blix said : ` ` By then , Mohamed ElBaradei revealed that Niger was not authentic . ''
British intelligence falsely claimed Iraq had been trying to acquire uranium from Niger .
Mr Blix said Mr ElBaradei had also challenged US claims that aluminium tubes found were for WMD purposes .
Mr Blix himself also expressed scepticism to the US secretary of state , Colin Powell , about alleged evidence of WMD .
The Iraq Survey Group , set up by the US to search for WMD , found none .
In Britain , inquiries into the route to war have been held by MPs , Lord Hutton and Lord Butler .
The intelligence service was criticised for not re - evaluating its assessments in the light of Mr Blix 's reports .
