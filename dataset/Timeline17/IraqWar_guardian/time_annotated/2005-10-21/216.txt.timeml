The Guardian profile : Lord Steyn He 's woven the Human Rights Act into our legal system .
He has a terrier - like tenacity and the courage of a lion Free from judicial shackles , the retired law lord is speaking his mind as the new chairman of Justice In his <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P10Y">10 years</TIMEX3> as a law lord , Johan Steyn never opened his mouth in the chamber of the House of Lords .
He thinks judges should play no part in parliament .
Throughout his years on the bench , his strongly held views on democracy , basic human rights , free speech and the rule of law made themselves heard , but only through his court judgments , lectures to lawyers and fellow judges , and articles in academic journals .
<TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2005-W42">This week</TIMEX3> , at the age of 73 , he cast off his judicial shackles and , as the newly installed chairman of the human rights group Justice , branded as ` ` a fairy tale '' Tony Bair 's insistence that the war in Iraq has not made London and the world more dangerous .
He recalled the prime minister 's pronouncement - heralding new terrorism laws - that after <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2005-07-07">July 7</TIMEX3> , ` ` the rules of the game are changing '' : Steyn 's response was ` ` to state without equivocation that the maintenance of the rule of law is not a game .
It is about access to justice , fundamental human rights and democratic values . ''
He went on to attack the ` ` flood '' of criminal justice legislation .
` ` Year after year , half - baked ideas are adopted in haste , puffed up to be the ideal solution and routinely abandoned <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2006-07-07">a year later</TIMEX3> . ''
He agreed with his predecessor as Justice chairman , Lord Alexander of Weedon , that the Iraq war was unlawful and ` ` in its search for a justification in law for war the government was driven to scrape the bottom of the legal barrel '' .
And , finally , the coup de grce : ` ` After the dreadful bombings in London we were asked to believe that the Iraq war did not make the world a more dangerous place .
Surely , on top of everything else , we do not have to listen to a fairy tale . ''
Retirement frees judges to speak their mind , but few have been so outspoken .

And Steyn made headlines even as a serving judge .
Take <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2003-11">November 2003</TIMEX3> , when the media picked up a lecture to lawyers in which he branded the US regime at Guantnamo Bay ` ` a monstrous failure of justice '' , and the system of trial by military tribunal ` ` a kangaroo court which makes a mockery of justice '' .
His words went round the world .
<TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">Two years</TIMEX3> before that , when Britain introduced executive detention without trial , his response was to deliver another of his trenchant lectures to lawyers and judges .
He expressed the view that the UK opt - out from the European convention on human rights , which the government had to do to bring in the legislation , was ` ` not , in the present circumstances , justified '' .
It was enough to get him removed , at the government 's insistence , from the panel of law lords hearing a challenge by Belmarsh detainees to the lawfulness of the opt - out .
Steyn is a leading advocate of the principle that judges should not defer to parliament and ministers simply because politicians are accountable to the electorate .
Judges too have a duty to the public , he argues , and should not simply take ministers ' word for it , but should probe and seek evidence .
His judgments had the same flavor .
Of the extension of ` ` special advocates '' - who can see secret evidence but not discuss it with the ` ` client '' they represent , from terrorism to parole cases - he said : ` ` The special advocate procedure strikes at the root of the prisoner 's fundamental right to a basically fair procedure . ''
His reverence for the rule of law and basic human rights springs from his experience of growing up and practising as a lawyer in apartheid South Africa .
The son of an eminent law professor at Stellenbosch , he grew up a bookish child and went to Oxford as a Rhodes scholar .
He returned to South Africa and established a practice at the bar in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="1958">1958</TIMEX3> , leaving in <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="1973">1973</TIMEX3> because of his opposition to apartheid .
He was surprised to be appointed a high court judge in <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="1985">1985</TIMEX3> by the Tory lord chancellor Lord Hailsham .
He wonders whether Hailsham got the wrong chap , because when they met later he repeatedly called him Charles .
Jeffrey Jowell , professor of public law at University College London , says that in the appeal court and Lords , Steyn 's judgments in cases involving prisoners and asylum seekers ` ` were paradigm shifts in thinking at the time '' .
Anthony Lester , the human rights QC and Liberal Democrat peer , agrees .
` ` He has woven the Human Rights Act into the fabric of our legal system .
He has a terrier - like tenacity , deeply - held convictions and the courage of a lion .
He 's going to be extraordinarily difficult to replace . ''
