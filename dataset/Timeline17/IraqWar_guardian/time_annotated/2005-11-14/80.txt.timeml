Corporal Roger Eustis , 47 , a civilian working for the MoD , was compulsorily mobilised for Operation Telic 1 , the invasion of Iraq in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2003-01">January 2003</TIMEX3> , and demobilised in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2005-09">September</TIMEX3> that year .
His specialist unit provided port operators and vessel crew .
I left because my missus did n't want me to be in the TA any more .
I was just doing a back - office job in Iraq , based mostly in Umm Qasr .
I was n't doing a war - fighting role so I was n't in incredible danger .
You could have put a 19 - year - old guy out of school doing it .
I came back and stayed in the TA for <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">two years</TIMEX3> .
I eventually left because my wife did not want me to be mobilised again - but it was my decision to leave .
All the way down the line I have said family first , job second , reserves third .
The key thing for people who were in the early deployment is that TA families do n't have anywhere near the support that the regulars take for granted .
She did n't know anybody else who was in the same boat .
Regular army wives all know each other and have a support network .
Also , I was losing # 500 <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P1M">a month</TIMEX3> .
I was quite prepared to go to Iraq .
I remain proud of the minimal contribution I made .
The only sour note has been that , <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">two years</TIMEX3> down the line , I have yet to receive my medal .
In contrast , the TA unit based in Tony Blair 's constituency , who were deployed <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> after us , were issued with their medals in a fine photo opportunity by the prime minister <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P1M" mod="APPROX">about a month</TIMEX3> after they returned .
Mr Eustis 's medal eventually arrived in the post <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2005-11-10">last Thursday</TIMEX3> Gary Haran Doyle , 34 , from Earlsfield in London , was a Lance Corporal working as a mechanic in the TA .
In civilian life he is an investment banking consultant and earns # 200,000 <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> .
I joined the TA in <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="1988">1988</TIMEX3> when I was 17 , during the height of the ` ` red threat '' .
I served in Bosnia on Operations Resolute and Lode Star -LRB- <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="1996">1996</TIMEX3> - <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="1997">97</TIMEX3> -RRB- .
When Operation Telic came about I was firmly in the camp that felt taking out Saddam and imposing a democratic government was a good thing .
I knew that 45 - minute missile readiness was an exaggeration .

But I was n't called up for the invasion .
I had the opportunity to volunteer or be called up later and I personally decided it was n't for me .
Although I backed the government with its new foreign policy objective , I decided that somebody else could do it .
I understand why the government has issues with paying high - earners .
If they were going to pay me # 100,000 for driving a truck I understand why they would have trouble justifying it .
I do miss it .
I would much rather spend <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DURATION" value="P1WE">a weekend</TIMEX3> running around with the lads in the TA <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="SET" value="P1M" freq="1">once a month</TIMEX3> than being on the slopes in Austria which is what I do <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> .
The TA is much more rewarding , the opportunities to serve in an operational role are wonderful but because of the threat of being called up and having to go through the rigmarole of what you earn , I decided to leave .

A sergeant major , 39 , who had been in the TA for <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DURATION" value="P20Y" mod="MORE_THAN">more than 20 years</TIMEX3> and resigned after serving in Iraq .
He does not want to be identified because of his mental health problems .
I was mobilised with just <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DURATION" value="P3D">three days</TIMEX3> ' notice on Operation Telic 1 .
I received the letter on the <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="2005-11-08">Tuesday</TIMEX3> and had to attend Chilwell -LRB- the TA training and mobilisation center in Nottingham -RRB- on the <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="2005-11-11">Friday</TIMEX3> .
I came back from Iraq in <TIMEX3 tid="t36" type="DATE" value="2003-07">July 2003</TIMEX3> and due to a monumental cock - up in the army pay office in Glasgow , found that my ex - wife 's payments through the CSA had been collected by the army but were never paid to her .
My employers were instructed to take 85 % of my salary in deductions .
I was left with # 280 <TIMEX3 tid="t38" type="DURATION" value="P1M">a month</TIMEX3> to feed my girlfriend and young family .
By the time I got back from Iraq I was credit blacklisted .
It 's just gone from a bad situation to worse .
I do n't think it 's a unique experience .
Financially , it 's been a nightmare .
Then there was the training and kit aspect .
Most people that went out there had cursory training .
When we mobilised , supplies at Chilwell were short .
The war left me damaged in a number of ways .
I came back in <TIMEX3 tid="t40" type="DATE" value="2005-07" mod="END">late July</TIMEX3> , just when David Kelly took his own life .
People were then being very questioning about the military operation that I had just been on .
I would be interested to see how a regular soldier coped with this type of thing .
I bet he does n't have people in his work coming up and saying I bet you feel bad about being involved in that war .
I boarded an aircraft at <TIMEX3 tid="t41" type="TIME" value="2005-11-11T01:00">1 am</TIMEX3> in Basra , landed in the UK at 8.30 am British time and got chucked up to Chilwell .
The medical checking was a joke in terms of depleted uranium .
By <TIMEX3 tid="t42" type="TIME" value="2005-11-11T18:00">6 pm</TIMEX3> they said , ` ` that 's it lads , you can go '' .
We had only had a 10 - <TIMEX3 tid="t44" type="DURATION" value="PT20M">20 minute</TIMEX3> presentation on post - traumatic stress disorder at Basra airport .
It was given at 11.30 pm at night when we were absolutely fragged and had been through a real nightmare .
I was sent home with no counselling or decompression talk .
I eventually had a mental breakdown .
I went to speak to my doctor because I was having great problems sleeping .
It took him <TIMEX3 tid="t45" type="DURATION" value="P6W">six weeks</TIMEX3> to get hold of my medical records from the army .
In the end it was their opinion that I had PTSD .
I was signed off for a course of counselling and spent <TIMEX3 tid="t47" type="DURATION" value="P1W">a week</TIMEX3> in a psychiatric unit because I felt my head was going to explode .
I was considering taking my own life .

And while I am having the breakdown it is my civilian employer that is taking the hit .
The army has screwed me up and spat me out at the other end .
A major , 39 , was a nurse in the regular army for <TIMEX3 tid="t48" type="DURATION" value="P3Y">three years</TIMEX3> before joining the TA .
He was mobilised for the Iraq war and left upon his return after <TIMEX3 tid="t49" type="DURATION" value="P6Y">six years</TIMEX3> ' service .
Significant numbers of TA medical personnel were mobilised in <TIMEX3 tid="t52" type="DATE" value="2003-02" mod="START">early February 2003</TIMEX3> , including many from my unit .
I was not and assumed I was not required .
It was a shock when <TIMEX3 tid="t55" type="DATE" value="2003-03" mod="APPROX">about a month later</TIMEX3> my mobilisation papers arrived .
I had to quickly make a will and ensure that money was not an issue .
My wife does not drive and we have no family within 200 miles and with her job and our small baby son to cope with it was going to be tough .
However , I felt compelled to go .
The army has paid for me to go sailing and skiing and I saw this as payback time .
I had , for all my personal misgivings about the war , a duty to the army and most especially as an army nurse , a duty to those soldiers fighting it .
We were told our training had been cut short as a result of our late mobilisation .
I suspect the late mobilisations were a result of the government 's reluctance to be seen to be preparing for war .
We had no in - theatre training or any time to acclimatise to the desert .
We were dumped in a war at very short notice .
No desert kit was issued , though we did get body armor .
We should have had three Combopens which are used to combat the effects of nerve agents .
There were not enough to go around .
The canisters for our respirators were out of date .
In theater , casualty bags used in the event of a soldier not being able to wear his respirator were in desperately short supply .
Instead of one per bed we had only two in the whole hospital .
We were 198 short .
Some clinical equipment was also in short supply , such as urine bottles and hand soap .
The body armor issued in the UK had to be handed in to equip the frontline soldiers .
It seemed unbelievable that we had been sent to war because our enemy might have WMDs , yet our soldiers were under - equipped to defend themselves from that very threat .
Once the war was over , the two regular field hospitals were sent home before ours .
The effect on our morale was devastating and when I spoke to my wife on the phone she was so choked she could n't speak .
I think it was at that point I knew my future in the TA was untenable .
When I got home my wife was certainly pleased to see me
but I knew she resented my absence and my son did not recognize me .
It hurt like hell .
Geraint Hughes joined the TA ` ` out of curiosity '' in <TIMEX3 tid="t59" type="DATE" value="1999">1999</TIMEX3> at 24 and was a Lance Corporal with the London Irish Rifles -LRB- the London Regiment -RRB- before requesting his discharge <TIMEX3 tid="t60" type="DATE" value="2005">this year</TIMEX3> .
He volunteered to go to Iraq in <TIMEX3 tid="t63" type="DATE" value="2004-03">March 2004</TIMEX3> .
My task was to command a four - man team in Basra , and I ' m happy to say that all those I was responsible for -LRB- as well as the platoon as a whole -RRB- came back from Iraq alive .
After we were demobilised in <TIMEX3 tid="t67" type="DATE" value="2004-12">December 2004</TIMEX3> I found adjusting to civilian life a little tricky , but <TIMEX3 tid="t66" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> I ' ve become adjusted to civvy street .
My platoon still sticks together , its members stay in touch , and every <TIMEX3 tid="t68" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> and again we meet up for a few beers and for memory 's sake .
I have a lot of time for my former platoon buddies , and feel glad to have experienced the camaraderie that military veterans speak so much of .
I left the TA in <TIMEX3 tid="t71" type="DATE" value="2005-04">April this year</TIMEX3> , mainly because I finally managed to get myself a full - time lecturing post .
This meant moving to Swindon which made it impossible to train with the London Regiment .
I could have joined a TA unit in Swindon - there 's a barracks <TIMEX3 tid="t73" type="DURATION" value="PT15M">15 minutes</TIMEX3> walk from my flat - but I have decided to focus on my academic career .
I have also , throughout my military career , only worn the headdress and cap - badge of the London Irish , and have no intention of joining another regiment .
As they say , once you have worn the caubeen -LRB- the Irish soldier 's headdress -RRB- no other hat fits .
Also , at 30 , I am no <TIMEX3 tid="t74" type="DATE" value="2005-SP">spring</TIMEX3> chicken , and the times when I could happily tab with a heavy bergen on my back , and a rifle in my hand , for kilometres on end has well and truly gone .
I have absolutely no regrets about serving on Telic - in fact , I ' m pretty sure that I would have regretted not going .
For all the hard training , the separation from family and friends , the dangers and the days when I was tired , bored , hungry , hot and stressed , it was worth it .
For all the cock - ups in postwar reconstruction , and the blunders in Washington and London , I still think that the war was necessary , and that leaving Saddam unrestrained and in power would have had disastrous consequences for the Iraqi people , if not for the region as a whole .
In the end I felt that the work we did on the ground did help ordinary Iraqis .
