Elaina Morton is not listed as one of the 2,000 Americans <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> confirmed killed in Iraq since the start of the war , but she might as well be .
In US military parlance the 23 - year - old lab technician from Kansas would have been referred to as a ` ` surviving spouse '' .
But <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P3M">three months</TIMEX3> after her husband , Staff Sergeant Benjamin Morton , was killed by insurgents in Mosul , Elaina picked up a gun and shot herself .
The fact that the military did not issue a press release to announce the death of the former college student who loved her cat , Stinky , and enjoyed hiking , photography and camping , does not make her any less a casualty of the war .
Hers is thought to be the first confirmed case of a war widow committing suicide , and as the US toll in Iraq <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2005-10-25">yesterday</TIMEX3> hit the grim 2,000 landmark her death is proof of the immeasurable emotional toll that the conflict has put on families of servicemen and women .
George Bush <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2005-10-25">yesterday</TIMEX3> spoke to wives of servicemen at Bollings air force base in Washington , as part of a strategy to confront the death toll head on by portraying the sacrifice in the Iraq war as the best way to keep terrorists from striking the US again .
But for many bereaved families the bigger picture the president highlighted has been consumed by the day - to - day struggle of coping with their grief .
Deedy Salie knows the feelings of isolation and desperation that Elaina Morton must have gone through before she took her life .
Deedy 's husband , David , was killed on Valentine 's Day <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2004">last year</TIMEX3> when his Humvee was blown up by an improvised explosive device in the restive city of Baquba , north - east of Baghdad .
` ` I was an army wife for <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P9Y">nine years</TIMEX3> , and the army way is ` suck it up and drive on ' , '' she says .
But no matter how hard she tried she could n't just suck it up , and she could n't just drive on .
The pressures put on a family by a very public death , she says , are extreme .
` ` I do n't want to say that any death is normal , but my husband 's death was all over the television and in the papers , '' she says .
` ` People recognized my children in the store .
It has been a rollercoaster .
<TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P1D">One day</TIMEX3> we all seem OK , but the next one of us just bottoms out .
Everybody keeps saying it is going to get easier , but when that happens I 'll call and let you know , because it is actually getting harder and harder . ''
Deedy says her daughter , Chyna , 12 , was so angry with her father for going to Iraq and getting killed that she has only just begun to grieve .
Lucas , six , had nightmares about insurgents hiding in the flowerbeds .
She does n't know what Hunter , three , is thinking .
When the family was living near the army base , support groups were available .
But Deedy , like Elaina Morton and countless other bereaved spouses , moved away to be closer to friends and family .
And that was the last she heard from the army .
` ` I do n't expect the army to coddle me for the rest of my life , but at the same time we should not be thrown to the wind , '' she says .
` ` There should be somebody who calls , a professional who can pick up on things .
I keep thinking about that poor girl who killed herself .
Who is to say that if a grief counsellor had been calling her just <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="SET" value="P1M" freq="1">once a month</TIMEX3> they would n't have picked up on those subtle little hints ? ''
Deedy sought out grief counselling for herself and her family but , still a proud army wife , it took her months to do so .
` ` I do n't want this to be about being for or against the war , '' she tells the Guardian .
` ` My husband still has lots of friends and colleagues over there .
But I do n't want what happened to that girl to happen to anyone else . ''
Inge Colton is another widow who wishes she could escape Iraq , but <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EVERY">every day</TIMEX3> when she turns on the television , listens to the radio , picks up a newspaper , it is right there in her face .
` ` It is not like he died of cancer or something , I see it <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EVERY">every day</TIMEX3> and I am confronted with it <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EVERY">every day</TIMEX3> . ''
Her husband , Chief Warrant Officer Lawrence Colton , was killed on <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2005-03-27">Easter Day</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2004">last year</TIMEX3> when his Apache helicopter was shot down by a surface - to - air missile while responding to a distress call from a fuel convoy under attack .
Inge had heard from a friend that an Apache from Fort Hood , Texas , had been downed in Baghdad , and when she opened the door of their home to find the uniformed men on the doorstep she knew instantly why they were there .
` ` But I still closed the door on them ; I did not want to hear what they were going to tell me .
When they knocked again I just said , ` Can you give me a second ? ' ''
For Inge , 41 , life will never be the same .
` ` Our country wants you to move on , but that is impossible because I live with it <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EVERY">every day</TIMEX3> of my life .
I get up in the morning and I put on makeup and make myself presentable , and people think I am getting back to normal .

But it 's a different kind of normal .
I still cry <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EVERY">every day</TIMEX3> . ''
According to Karen Spears Zacharias , who has set up a grassroots network linked to the website heromama.org for widows and the 1,200 children who have lost parents in Iraq , there is better support from the military than there was during the Vietnam era , when her father was killed .
But too many widows unable or unwilling to ask for help are falling through the cracks .
` ` What 23 - year - old girl is going to feel comfortable walking into a veterans center or military hospital for counselling ?
That 's like telling someone who lives 10 miles outside of town and who does n't own a car that there 's milk at the store - if they just go get it .
` ` People have said that suicide was Elaina 's choice and we should respect that .

But I do n't buy that .
When you 're 23 years old and commit suicide it is not about choice but about being in an unhealthy place .
We have a responsibility to go beyond just saying that we will be there for them and really be there for them . ''
She adds : ` ` No one wants to talk about suicide because there is a feeling that we failed that person .
But we need to talk about it , we ca n't wait to have 10 more widows kill themselves before we address it .
Because <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3> it does n't feel like we are anywhere near the end of this war . ''
