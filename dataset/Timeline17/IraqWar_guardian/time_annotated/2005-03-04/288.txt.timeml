' I just want to survive and go home with all my body parts ' Fears of soldiers on patrol in Mosul as US military death toll in Iraq tops 1,500 <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2005-03-04">Friday</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2005-03-04">4 March 2005</TIMEX3> 03.27

The city was quiet but the soldiers sitting and swaying inside the Stryker were animated by their favorite debate : was it better to be five metres or 20 metres from an explosion ?
The front gunner belonged to the 20 - metre school , figuring the greater distance reduced your chances of losing limbs to the blast .
The two rear gunners scoffed and said that would increase the odds of being hit by shrapnel , which fanned upwards and outwards .
<TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P5M">Five months</TIMEX3> of patrolling Mosul had furnished evidence for both views and the discussion was as well - worn as the Stryker 's tyres .
Sergeant David Phillips , 23 , sighed and patted his flak jacket .
` ` I just want to stay alive and go home with all my body parts . ''
He spoke for 150,000 American soldiers in Iraq .
<TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2005-03-03">Yesterday</TIMEX3> the number of US military deaths since the <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2003-03">March 2003</TIMEX3> invasion crept over 1,500 .
There was no official acknowledgment of the milestone , just curt statements that three soldiers had died in two separate attacks on <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2005-03-02">Wednesday</TIMEX3> .
` ` Names are being withheld pending notification of next of kin . ''
The figure includes accidents .
The daily drip of US casualties passes almost unnoticed <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> , a footnote to the wider slaughter of Iraqis : five policemen killed in two car bombs <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2005-03-03">yesterday</TIMEX3> , 13 soldiers killed on <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2005-03-02">Wednesday</TIMEX3> , a judge on <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2005-03-01">Tuesday</TIMEX3> , at least 115 police and army recruits and civilians on <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2005-02-28">Monday</TIMEX3> .
Some 18,000 civilians are estimated to have died .
<TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2005-03-03">Yesterday</TIMEX3> 's headlines were about the renewal of Iraq 's state of emergency , fresh attacks on oil pipelines , and deadlock between Shias and Kurds over forming a new government .
The men of Bravo company , an infantry unit which rides in the armored Stryker vehicles of 321 Battalion in Mosul , did not care that since George Bush 's re - election the artificial limbs and flag - draped coffins of US troops have faded in political significance .
For them , it was personal .
` ` I do n't tell my mom or my wife that we drive up and down streets getting blown up <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EVERY">every day</TIMEX3> .
They 'd just worry all the time .
I tell them we sit in the base and do the odd mission , '' said Sgt Nathan Purdy , who is 23 .
<TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DURATION" value="P1W">A week</TIMEX3> embedded with Bravo company , midway through <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> - long stint in an insurgent stronghold , showed a group of men with good morale and determination to catch ` ` bad guys '' but divided over the war and frustrated by an elusive enemy .
There was consensus about the reaction when home on leave .
` ` People wanting to buy you drinks , buy you food , wanting to shake your hand , they made you feel a hero , '' said Specialist Matt Sutton , 24 , from Illinois .
Those from liberal states such as Washington said anti - war activists did not criticise them personally or echo the Vietnam - era chant of baby killer .
` ` The country is behind us .
They did n't dare , '' said one lieutenant .
Bravo Company 's quarters are a bombed - out palace in the grounds of Camp Freedom , a sprawl of cabins and concrete shelters .
Mortars land regularly but tend not to hit anything .
Lieutenant Colonel Mike Gibler said his battalion 's main objective was rebuilding the Iraqi security forces which ` ` imploded '' <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2004-11">last November</TIMEX3> after insurgents overran Mosul 's police stations .
The Iraqi army was improving thanks to joint operations and would soon take half of the responsibility of securing the city .
Asked about the police force he rolled his eyes , but speculated that there was enough progress for US forces to leave within <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DURATION" value="P3Y">three years</TIMEX3> .
His desk had tomes on Islam and a ` ` Do n't mess with Texas '' sticker .
Enlisted men were less sure about progress , complaining they were always on the defensive and waiting to be attacked by insurgents .
` ` They fight like bitches , pop a few shots , then hide , '' said Sgt Ramirez Flores .
Drive - by shootings have wounded several in the unit but the big fear is roadside bombs which according to the Pentagon accounted for 56 % of all US battle deaths in the first <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DURATION" value="P2M">two months</TIMEX3> of <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2005">this year</TIMEX3> .
They are hidden in rubbish bags , animal carcasses , holes , rubble , cars and carts , turning every object into a potential killer .
A suicide car bomber rammed and immolated one of the battalion 's Strykers but all the occupants survived , prompting reverence for the eight - wheel , 23 - tonne monsters .

A tip about weapons caches <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2005-W09">this week</TIMEX3> led to a midnight mission to dig up a lawn .
` ` Fucking gardeners - what are we doing here ? ''
` ` And <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2005-03-05">tomorrow</TIMEX3> we 're giving out candy to kids again , '' replied his friend .
` ` We did n't train for this . ''
