It was once called the Venice of the East and with imagination you can still see why : boats skim across lagoons , golden domes glint in sunshine , coffee shops bustle in the old quarter .
Stroll down the corniche at sunset and you can stop for kebab and ice cream , smoke a hubbly bubbly , play chess and listen to the water lapping below .
And then , if you are a westerner , you can check you have not been followed , adjust your disguise , and signal to your bodyguard that you want to return to the hotel .
Basra declared itself open to foreign visitors <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2005-W22">this week</TIMEX3> but instructed them to be vigilant , dress like locals and hire armed escorts .
` ` Then there is a 70 % to 80 % chance you will be OK , '' beamed Abdul Razuqi , the head of the tourism office in Iraq 's second city .
Those odds are set to be tested if Iraqi Airways succeeds in running regular commercial flights between Basra and Heathrow , the first direct civilian air link between Iraq and the west .
` ` Flights to London should start soon .
In the near future you will see many tourism initiatives here , '' Mohammad Musabah , the provincial governor , told the Guardian .
Commercial flights between Basra and Baghdad resumed <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2005-W22">this week</TIMEX3> for the first time since the <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2003-03">March 2003</TIMEX3> invasion and there are plans to seek a slot at Heathrow within <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P2M">two months</TIMEX3> , according to Adel al - Helu , the head of the national airline 's Basra office .
Repairs are due to start <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2005-06" mod="END">later this month</TIMEX3> on the gutted shell that was the Sheraton , the city 's only five - star hotel , and boatmen say they are ready to whisk paying clients around the Shatt al - Arab waterway .
Its economy moribund , the city is desperate for investment and hopes to capitalize on its reputation as one of Iraq 's safer destinations .
Adventure holidays are about adrenaline but the threat of kidnapping and assassination made Costa Basra more chilling than thrilling , said Don Lucey , whose Swindon - based firm , Bann Tours , aborted a trip to southern Iraq <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2004-07">last July</TIMEX3> .
` ` It was too volatile so we stayed in Kuwait , '' he said .
` ` Anyone who goes alone into Iraq <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> is walking into a deathtrap . ''
Mr Lucey hoped to lead another group into the country when security improved .
Mr Razuqi , his office dark and hot in the wake of another power cut , suggested visitors could dye their hair and wear traditional robes to look more Iraqi .
Helmets and body armor would give the game away .
An attempt to write a brochure was abandoned because libraries with background material were burned and looted <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2003">two years ago</TIMEX3> .
` ` But we can guide people ourselves , '' the tourism manager said .
Those who can not wait for the Heathrow link can reach Iraq by flying from Istanbul to Irbil , in the relatively peaceful north , or fly from Syria or Jordan to Baghdad , or drive or sail from Kuwait or the United Arab Emirates to Basra .
The city 's lagoons are striking from the air but corkscrew descents - a stomach - churning defense against missiles - can spoil the experience .
Though the airport doubles as a British military base the terminal is often eerily deserted , with all but essential personnel and visitors banned .
Soldiers in armored Land Rovers trundle from the main gate , a maze of blast walls and razor wire , but tourists would have to arrange their own rides into town , a former playground for the Gulf region degraded by <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DURATION" value="P2DE">two decades</TIMEX3> of war and neglect .
The four - star Shatt al - Arab hotel is occupied by British troops but there are a dozen lesser hotels with spare rooms .
The Mirbad , known to some guests as the Morbid , is popular for the visibility of guards with assault rifles .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2005-06-02">Thursday</TIMEX3> a Shia cleric , Ali Abdul - Hussein , became the latest victim of sporadic assassinations which are blamed on rival militias and crooked police officers .
But compared with Baghdad the port city is tranquil , with military patrols and bombs a rarity .
` ` Just 1 % of all incidents Iraq - wide happen here , '' said Stuart Innes , the British consul general .
` ` Property prices are up and we are nearing a tipping point for investment .
Basra is blazing a trail . ''
He displayed a <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="1970">1970</TIMEX3> photo of a white - jacketed waiter serving drinks at a corniche casino , swans and yachts gliding in the background .
` ` It used to be like Monte Carlo . ''
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office advises against all but essential travel to Basra .
Tourists who ignore that will find museums gutted , theaters shut , streets reeking with rubbish and sewage and waterways littered with capsized vessels , including Saddam Hussein 's yacht .
The compensations are dazzling mosques , historic towns such as Qurna nearby , and marshes said to be the site of the Garden of Eden .
When not disguised , westerners tend to be greeted warmly , if curiously .
` ` Problem in the head ?
Why are you here ? ''
one waiter asked the Guardian .
One westerner said he acted deaf and dumb and even pretended to use sign language when out in public with his translator and guide .
` ` If they are ready to face the danger then they should come , though my advice is to wait for security to improve , '' said Khalaf al - Easa , the head of the city 's Iraqi Islamic party , an Arab Sunni group hostile to the occupation .
Since the invasion religiously conservative Shias have turned what had been an open , liberal society into something closer to Iran , with alcohol banned and women strongly encouraged to wear the veil .
Only men can sunbathe .
Black market beer and whisky can be bought from back - alley traders in a slum nicknamed Chechnya for its banditry .

But Mr Musabah , the governor , opened the door to an alcohol dispensation for tourists .
` ` In their hotels , maybe , '' he said .
