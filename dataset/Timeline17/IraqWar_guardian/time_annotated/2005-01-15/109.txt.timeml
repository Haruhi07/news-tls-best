A report by the National Intelligence Council says the war in Iraq has provided a training and recruitment ground for Islamist militants , much as Afghanistan did for the founding generation of al - Qaida during the war against the Soviet occupation in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="198">the 1980s</TIMEX3> .
As new terror organizations emerge on the world stage , al - Qaida will splinter into regional separatist groups , says the report , which forecasts global trends <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P15Y" mod="MORE_THAN">over the next 15 years</TIMEX3> .
` ` Iraq and other possible conflicts in the future could provide recruitment , training grounds , technical skills and language proficiency for a new class of terrorists who are ` professionalised ' and for whom political violence becomes an end in itself , '' the report says .
It gives warning that veterans of the conflict in Iraq could disperse around the world , exporting their deadly expertise .
Specifically , the report warns that the US faces an increasing risk of an attack involving biological agents , such as anthrax , and that an emerging and more sophisticated generation of terrorists could also use chemical weapons .
The bleak forecast undermines one of the Bush administration 's central justifications for invading Iraq : that it was necessary to curb terrorism ; that the country was a central front in the ` ` war on terror '' ; and that the deposed Iraqi dictator , Saddam Hussein , had links to al - Qaida 's chief , Osama bin Laden .
Instead , the report describes how hundreds of foreign terrorists entered Iraq after the US invasion , and how the insurgency against American forces was viewed by radical Muslims as a war against a foreign occupier , akin to the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
Terrorists also took advantage of postwar chaos , porous borders and a country awash with weapons .
But unlike the rise of al - Qaida in Afghanistan , the emerging terrorists do not require a geographical base , and are expected to rely increasingly on the internet .
` ` While taking advantage of sanctuaries around the world to train , terrorists will not need a stationary headquarters to plan and carry out operations , '' the report says .
` ` Training materials , targeting guidance , weapons knowhow and fundraising will increasingly be virtual . ''
The terrorists <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> recruited and trained in Iraq will eventually become the successor generation to al - Qaida , it predicts .
` ` Al - Qaida membership that was distinguished by having trained in Afghanistan will gradually dissipate , to be replaced in part by the dispersion of the experienced survivors of the conflict in Iraq . ''
The 119 - page report was based on analysis from more than 1,000 US and foreign observers , and is designed to help the White House track world trends up to <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2020">2020</TIMEX3> .
Staff Sergeant Cardenas Alban was sentenced at a court martial <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2005-01-14">yesterday</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> in jail for the murder of a severely wounded Iraqi teenager in a Baghdad slum district during a Shi'ite uprising <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2004">last year</TIMEX3> , the US military said .
