US - led forces leave a trail of destruction and contamination in architectural site of world importance <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2005-01-15">Saturday</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2005-01-15">15 January 2005</TIMEX3> 16.16 GMT Troops from the US - led force in Iraq have caused widespread damage and severe contamination to the remains of the ancient city of Babylon , according to a damning report released <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2005-01-15">today</TIMEX3> by the British Museum .
John Curtis , keeper of the museum 's Ancient Near East department and an authority on Iraq 's many archaeological sites , found ` ` substantial damage '' on an investigative visit to Babylon <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2004-12">last month</TIMEX3> .
The ancient city has been used by US and Polish forces as a military depot for <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">the past two years</TIMEX3> , despite objections from archaeologists .
` ` This is tantamount to establishing a military camp around the Great Pyramid in Egypt or around Stonehenge in Britain , '' says the report , which has been seen by the Guardian .
Among the damage found by Mr Curtis , who was invited to Babylon by Iraqi antiquities experts , were cracks and gaps where somebody had tried to gouge out the decorated bricks forming the famous dragons of the Ishtar Gate .
He saw a 2,600 - year - old brick pavement crushed by military vehicles , archaeological fragments scattered across the site , and trenches driven into ancient deposits .
Vast amounts of sand and earth , visibly mixed with archaeological fragments , were gouged from the site to fill thousands of sandbags and metal mesh baskets .
When this practice was stopped , large quantities of sand and earth were brought in from elsewhere , contaminating the site for future generations of archaeologists .
Mr Curtis called for an international investigation by archaeologists chosen by the Iraqis to record all the damage done by the occupation forces .
<TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="TIME" value="2005-01-14TNI">Last night</TIMEX3> the US military defended its operations at the site , but said all earth - moving projects had been stopped and it was considering moving troops away to protect the ruins .
Babylon , a city renowned for its beauty and its splendor 1,000 years before Europe built anything comparable , was chosen as the site for a US military base in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2003-04">April 2003</TIMEX3> , just after the invasion of Iraq .
Military commanders set up their camp in the heart of one of the world 's most important archaeological sites and surrounded the enclosed part of the ancient city .
At least 2,000 troops were installed , daily passing iconic relics like the enormous basalt Lion of Babylon sculpture .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2003-09">September 2003</TIMEX3> the base was passed to a Polish - led force , which held it until <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2005-01-15">today</TIMEX3> 's formal handover of the site to the Iraqi culture ministry .
In his report , Mr Curtis accepted that initially the US military presence helped protect the site from looters .
But he described as ` ` regrettable '' the decision to set up a base in such an important spot .
He found that large areas of the site had been covered in gravel brought in from outside , compacted and sometimes chemically treated to provide helipads , car parks and accommodation and storage areas .
` ` The status of future information about these areas will therefore be seriously compromised , '' he said .
Archaeologists were horrified by the confirmation of reports which have been filtering out of Iraq for months .
` ` Outrage is hardly the word , this is just dreadful , '' said Lord Redesdale , an archaeologist and head of the all - party parliamentary archaeological group .
` ` These are world sites .
Not only is what the American forces are doing damaging the archaeology of Iraq , it 's actually damaging the cultural heritage of the whole world . ''
Tim Schadla Hall , reader in public archaeology at the Institute of Archaeology at University College London , said : ` ` In this case we see an international conflict in which the US has failed to take into account the requirements of the Hague convention ... to protect major archaeological sites - just another convention it seems happy to ignore . ''
Lieutenant Colonel Steven Boylan , a US military spokes man in Baghdad , said engineering works at the camp were discussed with the head of the Babylon museum .
` ` An archaeologist examined every construction initiative for its impact on historical ruins . ''
He said plans were being considered to move some of the units in order ` ` to better preserve the Babylon ruins . ''
` ` The significance of Babylon is not lost on the coalition , '' he added .
` ` The site dates back to the time of Nebuchadnezzar 's Babylon , but there are very few visible original remains to the untrained eye . ''
