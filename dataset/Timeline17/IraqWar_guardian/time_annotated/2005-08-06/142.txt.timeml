The former foreign secretary Robin Cook has died after collapsing on a mountain in Scotland , Scottish police have announced .
Mr Cook had apparently collapsed with a suspected heart attack on the mountainside while out walking during his <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2005-SU">summer</TIMEX3> holidays .
He was also reported to have seriously injured himself in a fall after his collapse .
The father - of - two grown up sons was on the mountain for nearly half <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="PT1H">an hour</TIMEX3> before rescue services reached him .
Then , guided by medical experts via telephone , they battled to revive him using cardio pulmonary resuscitation equipment , before he was airlifted by helicopter to hospital in Inverness .
Mr Cook arrived at hospital at <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="TIME" value="2005-08-06T16:00">4 pm</TIMEX3> - some <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="PT90M">90 minutes</TIMEX3> after his collapse and was declared dead <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="UNDEF-REF-minute-PLUS-5">five minutes later</TIMEX3> , said a spokesman for NHS Highland .
But it was <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="UNDEF-REF-hour-PLUS-3" mod="MORE_THAN">more than three hours later</TIMEX3> before police confirmed his death .
A police spokesman added : ` ` As is normal in such circumstances , a report will be prepared for the Procurator Fiscal . ''
Prime minister Tony Blair described Mr Cook as ` ` an outstanding , extraordinary talent '' .
In a statement released by 10 Downing Street , Mr Blair said : ` ` Our thoughts and prayers are with Gaynor and all Robin 's family .
` ` This news will be received with immense sadness , not just in Britain but in many parts of the world .
` ` Robin was an outstanding , extraordinary talent - brilliant , incisive in debate , of incredible skill and persuasive power . ''
Mr Cook was a keen hill - walker , who regularly spent his <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2005-SU">summer</TIMEX3> holidays with close family and friends enjoying the dramatic mountain scenery of Highland Scotland , rather than going abroad .
A leading figure in the Labor party for decades , Mr Cook was put in the key job of foreign secretary when the party won power in <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="1997">1997</TIMEX3> .
He was demoted to the post of leader of the Commons following Labor 's second election victory in <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2001">2001</TIMEX3> and resigned from the cabinet in protest at the Iraq war in <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2003">2003</TIMEX3> .
He then became one of the sharpest critics of the government 's foreign policy in Iraq .
Mr Cook 's devotion to enhancing the role of parliament as leader of the Commons made him a popular figure among backbench MPs , and his powerful resignation speech on the eve of war won him great respect from opponents of military action .
