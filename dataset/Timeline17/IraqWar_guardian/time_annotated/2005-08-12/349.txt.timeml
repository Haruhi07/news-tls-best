It is not only Iraq that is occupied .
America is too My country is in the grip of a president surrounded by thugs in suits <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2005-08-12">Friday</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2005-08-12">12 August 2005</TIMEX3>
01.21 BST It has quickly become clear that Iraq is not a liberated country , but an occupied country .
We became familiar with that term during the second world war .
We talked of German - occupied France , German - occupied Europe .
And after the war we spoke of Soviet - occupied Hungary , Czechoslovakia , eastern Europe .
It was the Nazis , the Soviets , who occupied countries .
The United States liberated them from occupation .
<TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> we are the occupiers .
True , we liberated Iraq from Saddam Hussein , but not from us .
Just as in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="1898">1898</TIMEX3> we liberated Cuba from Spain , but not from us .
Spanish tyranny was overthrown , but the US established a military base in Cuba , as we are doing in Iraq .
US corporations moved into Cuba , just as Bechtel and Halliburton and the oil corporations are moving into Iraq .
The US framed and imposed , with support from local accomplices , the constitution that would govern Cuba , just as it has drawn up , with help from local political groups , a constitution for Iraq .
And it is an ugly occupation .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2003-08-07">August 7 2003</TIMEX3> the New York Times reported that General Sanchez in Baghdad was worried about the Iraqi reaction to occupation .
Pro - US Iraqi leaders were giving him a message , as he put it : ` ` When you take a father in front of his family and put a bag over his head and put him on the ground , you have had a significant adverse effect on his dignity and respect in the eyes of his family . ''
-LRB-
That 's very perceptive .
-RRB-
We know that fighting during the US offensive in <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2004-11">November 2004</TIMEX3> destroyed three - quarters of the town of
Falluja -LRB- population 360,000 -RRB- , killing hundreds of its inhabitants .
The objective of the operation was to cleanse the town of the terrorist bands acting as part of a ` ` Ba'athist conspiracy '' .
But we should recall that on <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2003-06-16">June 16 2003</TIMEX3> , barely <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DURATION" value="P6W">six weeks</TIMEX3> after President Bush had claimed victory in Iraq , two reporters for the Knight Ridder newspaper group wrote this about the Falluja area : ` ` In dozens of interviews during <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DURATION" value="P5D">the past five days</TIMEX3> , most residents across the area said there was no Ba'athist or Sunni conspiracy against US soldiers , there were only people ready to fight because their relatives had been hurt or killed , or they themselves had been humiliated by home searches and road stops ...
One woman said , after her husband was taken from their home because of empty wooden crates which they had bought for firewood , that the US is guilty of terrorism . ''
Soldiers who are set down in a country where they were told they would be welcomed as liberators and find they are surrounded by a hostile population become fearful and trigger - happy .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2005-03-04">March 4</TIMEX3> nervous , frightened GIs manning a roadblock fired on the Italian journalist Giuliana Sgrena , just released by kidnappers , and an intelligence service officer , Nicola Calipari , whom they killed .
We have all read reports of US soldiers angry at being kept in Iraq .
Such sentiments are becoming known to the US public , as are the feelings of many deserters who are refusing to return to Iraq after home leave .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2003-05">May 2003</TIMEX3> a Gallup poll reported that only 13 % of the US public thought the war was going badly .
According to a poll published by the New York Times and CBS News on <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2005-06-17">June 17</TIMEX3> , 51 % <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> think the US should not have invaded Iraq or become involved in the war .
Some 59 % disapprove of Bush 's handling of the situation .
But more ominous , perhaps , than the occupation of Iraq is the occupation of the US .
I wake up in the morning , read the newspaper , and feel that we are an occupied country , that some alien group has taken over .
I wake up thinking : the US is in the grip of a president surrounded by thugs in suits who care nothing about human life abroad or here , who care nothing about freedom abroad or here , who care nothing about what happens to the earth , the water or the air , or what kind of world will be inherited by our children and grandchildren .
More Americans are beginning to feel , like the soldiers in Iraq , that something is terribly wrong .
More and more <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EVERY">every day</TIMEX3> the lies are being exposed .
And then there is the largest lie , that everything the US does is to be pardoned because we are engaged in a ` ` war on terrorism '' , ignoring the fact that war is itself terrorism , that barging into homes and taking away people and subjecting them to torture is terrorism , that invading and bombing other countries does not give us more security but less .
The Bush administration , unable to capture the perpetrators of the <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="2004-09-11">September 11</TIMEX3> attacks , invaded Afghanistan , killing thousands of people and driving hundreds of thousands from their homes .
Yet it still does not know where the criminals are .
Not knowing what weapons Saddam Hussein was hiding , it invaded and bombed Iraq in <TIMEX3 tid="t36" type="DATE" value="2003-03">March 2003</TIMEX3> , disregarding the UN , killing thousands of civilians and soldiers and terrorising the population ; and not knowing who was and was not a terrorist , the US government confined hundreds of people in Guant namo under such conditions that 18 have tried to commit suicide .
The Amnesty International Report 2005 notes : ` ` Guant namo Bay has become the gulag of our times ...
When the most powerful country in the world thumbs its nose at the rule of law and human rights , it grants a licence to others to commit abuse with impunity '' .
The ` ` war on terrorism '' is not only a war on innocent people in other countries ; it is a war on the people of the US : on our liberties , on our standard of living .
The country 's wealth is being stolen from the people and handed over to the super - rich .
The lives of the young are being stolen .
The Iraq war will undoubtedly claim many more victims , not only abroad but also on US territory .
The Bush administration maintains that , unlike the Vietnam war , this conflict is not causing many casualties .
True enough , fewer than 2,000 service men and women have lost their lives in the fighting .

But when the war finally ends , the number of its indirect victims , through disease or mental disorders , will increase steadily .
After the Vietnam war , veterans reported congenital malformations in their children , caused by Agent Orange .
Officially there were only a few hundred losses in the Gulf war of <TIMEX3 tid="t39" type="DATE" value="1991">1991</TIMEX3> , but the US Gulf War Veterans Association has reported 8,000 deaths in <TIMEX3 tid="t42" type="DURATION" value="P10Y">the past 10 years</TIMEX3> .
Some 200,000 veterans , out of 600,000 who took part , have registered a range of complaints due to the weapons and munitions used in combat .
We have yet to see the long - term effects of depleted uranium on those <TIMEX3 tid="t43" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> stationed in Iraq .
Our faith is that human beings only support violence and terror when they have been lied to .

And when they learn the truth , as happened in the course of the Vietnam war , they will turn against the government .
We have the support of the rest of the world .
The US can not indefinitely ignore the 10 million people who protested around the world on <TIMEX3 tid="t46" type="DATE" value="2003-02-15">February 15 2003</TIMEX3> .
There is no act too small , no act too bold .
The history of social change is the history of millions of actions , small and large , coming together at points in history and creating a power that governments can not suppress .
