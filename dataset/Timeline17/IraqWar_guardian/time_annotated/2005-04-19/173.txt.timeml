BST Marla Ruzicka , who has been killed by a car bomber near Baghdad airport , was an extraordinary , one - person American aid agency , who worked tirelessly to get compensation for victims of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq .
Though only 28 when she died , she was an unusual mixture of charm , ebullience , adventure - seeking and tireless dedication to helping ordinary people whose lives had been shattered .
She lobbied journalists and diplomats with equal persistence , but loved nothing better than to sit with wretched families after the spotlight had moved on , record every detail of their stories , go out and campaign for official apologies and compensation - and then stay in touch to keep them informed .
On the day she died , on Iraq 's most dangerous road , she had been out talking to bereaved families .
Her driver\/translator , Faiz Al Salaam , who also died , worked with her for <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P2Y" mod="LESS_THAN">almost two years</TIMEX3> .
An unemployed pilot when she hired him , he had started flying for Iraq Air again , and , as the father of a two - month - old daughter , wanted to give up the danger of his work with Marla .

But she was due to leave Baghdad <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2005-W16">this week</TIMEX3> , and he stayed on out of loyalty .
They were driving , by chance , near a convoy of foreign contractors ' vehicles , which were the bomber 's target .
Dressed in a long black abbaya , the head - to - toe covering which most western women <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> wear in Baghdad as protection , Marla used an ordinary car .
Looking like a teenager - and with her bubbly enthusiasm and girlish shriek of a laugh - she was not always taken seriously when she arrived in her first big war zone , Afghanistan , just after the Taliban were ousted in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2001-12">December 2001</TIMEX3> .
Unlike most aid workers , she cultivated journalists , and wanted to know where the next party was .

But her commitment to getting help for the forgotten was ferocious .
One of her first actions in Kabul was to help organise a visit by American women who had lost family members on 9\/11 .
They wanted to meet Afghan families whose homes had been destroyed by American bombs .
Marla campaigned relentlessly by telephone and email , as well as by personal lobbying , and persuaded US Senator Patrick Leahy to put an amendment into a foreign aid bill to give $ 2.5 m for Afghan victims .
It was not described as compensation , since the US did not wish to take formal responsibility , but Marla visited families all over Afghanistan , drew up lists of names , and helped to ensure that the money was distributed to the right people .
In Afghanistan , she was working for Global Exchange , a non - governmental organization based in San Francisco .
After the Iraq war , she created her own charity , CIVIC -LRB-
Campaign for Innocent Victims in Conflict -RRB- .
One aim was to keep a running account of the number of civilian deaths , but it quickly became an effort to help individuals .
In an essay sent to Human Rights Watch shortly before she died , Marla wrote : ` ` A number is important not only to quantify the cost of the war , but , to me , each number is also a story of someone whose hopes , dreams and potential will never be realized , and who left behind a family . ''
She continued her lobbying and got $ 20 m for victims in Iraq .
She also developed contacts in the US military , trying to get them to describe otherwise unreported incidents , and take responsibility .
In a typical entry from her journal , published on AlterNet on <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2003-11-06">November 6 2003</TIMEX3> , she reported : ` ` On <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2004-10-24">October 24</TIMEX3> , former teacher Mohammad Kadhum Mansoor , 59 , and his wife , Hamdia Radhi Kadhum , 45 , were traveling with their three daughters - Beraa , 21 , Fatima , 8 , and Ayat , 5 - when they were tragically run over by an American tank .
` ` A grenade was thrown at the tank , causing it to lose control and veer on to the highway , over the family 's small Volkswagen .
Mohammad and Hamdia were killed instantly , orphaning the three girls in the back seat .
The girls survived , but with broken and fractured bodies .
We are not sure of Ayat 's fate ; her backbone is broken .
` ` CIVIC staff member Faiz Al Salaam monitors the girls ' condition <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EACH">each day</TIMEX3> .
Nobody in the military or the US army has visited them , nor has anyone offered to help this very poor family . ''
Born in the small town of Lakeport , California , Marla became politically active at the age of 15 , when she was suspended from high school for leading a protest against the first Gulf war .
While at Long Island University , she traveled extensively , visiting Cuba , Guatemala , southern Africa and the West Bank .
She was already working as a volunteer for Global Exchange .
Despite her exuberant exterior , she was not always happy , and her activism was sometimes both an obsession and a therapy .

For exercise in Baghdad , she regularly stormed up and down the pool at the al Hamra hotel , the headquarters of the newspapers which preferred not to have large , guarded villas .
Last new year 's eve , she emailed friends : ` ` <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2005">2005</TIMEX3> is going to rock for you all and me too ...
I write to you from the Himalayan mountains , where I am on a seven - day trek .
Wow , is my mind clear , and I have many goals for <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2005">2005</TIMEX3> .
After my trek , I 'll work on a campaign to protect Nepalese activists - there have been over 3,000 disappearances here - more than Colombia .
Then I am off to Afghanistan to check on the families who lost loved ones in Operation Enduring Freedom . ''
Marla had also been planning to spend more time fundraising in the US .
She had an initial grant from George Soros 's Open Society Institute , but wanted to develop more sources .
After the Iraq election in <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2005-01">January</TIMEX3> , she decided to make another trip to Baghdad .
Medea Benjamin , her original mentor at Global Exchange , tried to dissuade her because of the increased danger .
` ` I thought it would be better to wait for a while and see if the situation got better than to put her life at risk , '' she told the Los Angeles Times .
` ` She was determined to go because the people she worked with did n't have the luxury not to be at risk . ''
