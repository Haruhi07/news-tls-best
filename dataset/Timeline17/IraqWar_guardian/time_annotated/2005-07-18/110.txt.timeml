Thinktank says war boosts al - Qaida Britain 's involvement in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan contributed to the terrorist attacks in London , a respected independent thinktank on foreign affairs , the Chatham House organization , says <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2005-07-18">today</TIMEX3> .
According to the body , which includes leading academics and former civil servants among its members , the key problem in the UK for preventing terrorism is that the country is ` ` riding as a pillion passenger with the United States in the war against terror '' .
It says Britain 's ability to carry out counter - terrorism measures has also been hampered because the US is always in the driving seat in deciding policy .
The report says the security services , diverted by fighting the IRA over Northern Ireland and the rise of animal activists committing terrorist acts , failed to give priority in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="199" mod="START">the early 1990s</TIMEX3> to monitoring Islamist terror activists setting up in Britain , so ` ` the British authorities did not fully appreciate the threat from al - Qaida '' .
In the most politically sensitive finding , Chatham House , which used to be known as the Royal Institute of International Affairs , concludes there is ` ` no doubt '' the invasion of Iraq has ` ` given a boost to the al - Qaida network '' in ` ` propaganda , recruitment and fundraising '' , while providing an ideal targeting and training area for terrorists .
` ` Riding pillion with a powerful ally has proved costly in terms of British and US military lives , Iraqi lives , military expenditure and the damage caused to the counter - terrorism campaign . ''
This finding runs counter to the line from Downing Street , which has sought to detach Iraq from the London attacks .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2005-07-16">Saturday</TIMEX3> , Tony Blair said the fanatics who struck in London and launched other attacks around the world were driven by an ` ` evil ideology '' rather than opposition to any policy , and that it would be a ` ` misunderstanding of a catastrophic order '' to think that if we changed our behavior they would change theirs .
Amid the growing debate over proposed terror laws in Britain , the Tories will <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2005-07-18">today</TIMEX3> offer Charles Clarke , the home secretary , the chance to speed up new laws , provided that the government delays until <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2006">next year</TIMEX3> proposals to revise the control orders system for detaining suspect terrorists .
David Davis , the shadow home secretary , will ask the government to bring forward full details of one of the most divisive parts of the legislation - the indirect incitement to terrorism offence - by <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P1M">a month</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2005-09">September</TIMEX3> , so MPs and human rights groups such as Liberty can study them properly before the bill is published in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2004-10">October</TIMEX3> .
Mr Davis will make his offer during talks <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2005-07-18">today</TIMEX3> with Mr Clarke , which will also be attended by Mark Oaten , the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman .
Lord Falconer , the lord chancellor , indicated yes terday that the government might be prepared to speed up anti - terror measures if it could reach agreement with the opposition parties .
He told BBC Radio 4 's Westminster Hour : ` ` We should not rush into things because these things need careful thought .
But if the opposition parties and the police can reach a consensus with us , then we can do it very quickly . ''
Azzam Tamimi of the Muslim Association of Britain told a rally in Russell Square , near the scene of the bus bombing , that the Muslim community would not suffer in silence for the crimes of the suicide bombers .
` ` We will continue to talk , we will continue to write and we will continue to challenge the government .
I say to Muslims , do not bow to pressure to keep accepting those pointing fingers at you .
` ` Say , ` No , I ' m not responsible for what happened on <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2005-07-07">July 7</TIMEX3> .
My heart bleeds , I condemn it , yes , but I did not make those boys angry .
I did not send those bombs to Iraq .
I do not keep people locked in Guantnamo Bay and I do not have anything to do with Abu Ghraib , except to denounce it . '
Politicians , see what you have done to this world ? ''
Six people have been arrested in Leeds under the Anti - Terrorism Act , police said <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="TIME" value="2005-07-17TNI">last night</TIMEX3> , but a police source in the capital said the arrests were not linked to the <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2005-07-07">July 7</TIMEX3> attacks .
