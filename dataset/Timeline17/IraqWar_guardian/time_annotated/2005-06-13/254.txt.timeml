The -LRB- relatively -RRB- moderate conservative cleric Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , an ally of the unelected supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , is widely tipped to prevail in the election .

But Iranian bloggers are <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2005-06-13">today</TIMEX3> writing that <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2005-05">this may</TIMEX3> not be the certainty everyone had thought and that there is a late surge from the main reform candidate , former education minister Mostafa Moin , 54 .
Hossein Derakhshan , a Toronto - based Iranian who is visiting Tehran , writes on his Editor : Myself blog that he can not believe ` ` that mainstream media in Iran are ignoring all signs of a reformist candidate 's rise and still pushing for Rafsanjani as the savior '' .

Ken Livingstone is 60 <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2005-06-13">today</TIMEX3> .
The mayor has no official engagements <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2005-06-13">today</TIMEX3> , but the London Assembly Lib Dems lost no time in wishing him a happy birthday .
` ` Mr Livingstone is <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> entitled to his Freedom Pass that will allow him to travel across the capital free of charge , '' a spokesman said <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2005-06-13">today</TIMEX3> .
` ` The Liberal Democrats are hoping that with his new bus pass , the mayor will take the opportunity to visit many of the outer London areas that he has neglected <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P5Y" mod="MORE_THAN">over the last five years</TIMEX3> . ''
Actually , he wo n't be collecting the bus pass he 's entitled to - and anyway , a free travelcard is one of the perks of working at City Hall .
The mayor has enjoyed remarkable popularity ratings among Londoners since he was elected in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2000">2000</TIMEX3> , and few would bet against his running for a third term in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> .
But his detractors sense impending trouble .
They say Livingstone has neglected the binge drinking and traffic problems of suburban areas like Sutton and Croydon in favor of big inner city projects , and has failed to do enough to improve the Underground or combat congestion .
No doubt his critics will be out in force at the <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2005">2005</TIMEX3> State of London debate <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2005-W25">next week</TIMEX3> .

Downing Street has announced the appointment of the 98th Archbishop of York , who will be John Sentamu , the first black man to hold the post in its 1,500 year history .
It will be the most senior appointment ever held by a member of an ethnic minority within the Church of England .
Sentamu , <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> Bishop of Birmingham , immediately traveled to York <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2005-06-13">today</TIMEX3> - taking the last second class place on a train full of York racegoers - to pray before the high altar of the great medieval cathedral , perhaps conscious that his journey has been rather longer and more extraordinary , probably , than that of any of his predecessors since the appointment of the city 's first archbishop , Paulinus , in <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="0625">625 AD</TIMEX3> .

Andy Kershaw , the Radio 3 presenter and world music enthusiast , began the backlash against the largely white Live 8 line - ups when he said it would do nothing for ` ` Africa 's self - esteem '' .
He returns to the topic in the Independent , accusing Bob Geldof of ` ` breathtaking arrogance '' for inviting African artists to play at an ` ` Africa Calling '' concert at the Eden Project in Cornwall .
First , he dismisses the idea of having Africans on his bill since , supposedly , they are not big enough draws .
<TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> , outrageously , he is planning to corral the Africans into Cornwall rather than allow them to appear on the same stage , on equal terms , with their European and American counterparts .

And I thought apartheid was dead ...
Kershaw 's language is strong and , as this blog has argued before , the extension others have made of his argument - that Live 8 is somehow a conspiracy to keep Africans down - is missing the point .
The idea is to create a populist upsurge to pressure the G8 leaders , not to change the public 's attitude to Africa .
That would be a happy consequence , however , and if - as Kershaw puts it - a ` ` few African bands -LRB- may even be -RRB- refreshing after watching hours of clapped - out , over - familiar rock stars '' , that is no bad thing either .
I ' ve just spoken to religious affairs correspondent Stephen Bates , who 's on a train with the Church of England 's first black Archbishop .
Stephen will be posting to the Newsblog <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2005-06-13">today</TIMEX3> .
European leaders are meeting <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2005-06-13">today</TIMEX3> in Brussels to discuss the thorny question of budget reforms .

Here on the Newsblog we report on the latest attack on Bob Geldof 's Live 8 line - up .
Iranians are voting in their election <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2005-06-13">today</TIMEX3> ; we 'll have an audio report from Robert Tait in Tehran and a round - up of the best pictures .

And Jane Perrone blogs here about the great asparagus shortage of <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="2005">2005</TIMEX3> .
Where 's the best place to hit capitalism where it hurts ?
On the course , of course .
The links between golf and filthy lucre have always looked pretty strong , as this report in Capitalism magazine perfectly illustrates , hailing the climax of the <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="2003">2003</TIMEX3> US Masters as ` ` a good day for golf , capitalism , and , of course , Mike Weir '' .
After all , what other sport attaches such importance -LRB- in public , at any rate -RRB- to its ` money list ' ?
Indeed , one of the moments of maximum emotional impact in Michael Moore 's Fahrenheit 9\/11 , the evidence that appeared to clinch the case for George Bush 's status as corporate ratbag no 1 , came when the president turned to the cameras after outlining his stance on global terrorism and urged : ` ` <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> watch this drive . ''
So it seemed appropriate when <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="2005">this year</TIMEX3> 's summit of the G8 group of the world 's wealthiest nations was sited in Gleneagles , one of the world 's most famous golfing spots .
But , those less favourably disposed to the idea of global capitalist hegemony have also dabbled in the sport , and Gleneagles <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DATE" value="2005">2005</TIMEX3> provided a perfect opportunity for anti - capitalism protesters to make their point .
An anarchist organization calling itself the People 's Golfing Association looks able to achieve this aim with some lan , even if their style is slightly more SAS commando than Payne Stewart .
Theresa <TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="DATE" value="2006-05">May</TIMEX3> wants more women .
Specifically , she wants 50 of them to fight the Tories ' most winnable seats at the next election .
<TIMEX3 tid="t37" type="DATE" value="2005-05">This may</TIMEX3> not sound particularly radical - and by the standards of the Labor party , which has already embraced all - female shortlists and the Emily 's List initiative , it is n't .
None the less , the shadow secretary 's call for half of the Tories ' top targets to be contested by women will dismay many in the party - and not just male would - be candidates , but also those who oppose positive action on principle .
As many of them admitted at a Fawcett Society fringe event <TIMEX3 tid="t40" type="DATE" value="2004">last year</TIMEX3> , Tory ladies of a certain age tend to pick men to represent them in the Commons .
Often this is because they fear women with families will not be able to devote all their resources to winning the seat .
Sometimes female candidates lack the time for the schmoozing that wins over local party members .
And there is strong grassroots resistance to all - female shortlists - not just because members feel Conservative Central Office is telling them what to do , but because Tories tend to believe that the talented should be able to rise to the top without special favors .

Morning all .
I ' ve just been listening to Bono impersonate Warren Buffett .
The rock star has spent <TIMEX3 tid="t42" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> talking to the Guardian 's Madeleine Bunting about how he 's trying to win over American hearts to his Africa crusade : you can hear an audio clip of him talking about how the legendary stock market investor told him : ` ` Do n't appeal to the conscience of America , appeal to its greatness , and I think you 'll get the job done . ''
News has been trickling out <TIMEX3 tid="t43" type="TIME" value="2005-06-13TMO">this morning</TIMEX3> about a hostage drama at an international school in Cambodia : the latest is that a girl has been killed as police freed the hostages .
We 'll be keeping an eye on Tony Blair as he tries to save Britain 's EU rebate at the European summit in Brussels ; we ' ve also followed up the latest royal security breach involving a fake bomb and a tabloid reporter , this time targeting Prince Harry at Sandhurst , and we 'll be reporting on a video smuggled out of China showing violence over land rights that left six people dead .

It is possible that some of you , at one time or another , may have disagreed with the Guardian 's carefully - considered leader columns .
These articles - called editorials in the US - appear without a byline , and are set out as the opinion of the paper as a whole .
Clearly , not every individual in an organization will agree with a given article - but it is leaders that give a paper its voice .
To create a conversation , we encourage readers to send in comments for our letters page and to contact our readers ' editor , Ian Mayes , with corrections or complaints .
You can also post to our talkboards , contact writers directly , and post comments to the newsblog .
But we have never asked you , our valued readers , to actually write the leaders yourselves .
That 's exactly what Andres Martinez , the editorial page editor at the LA Times , has proposed for his paper 's website .
He 's called it the wikitorial , a feature that will allow readers to rewrite LA Times editorials .

When Oliver Letwin stepped down from the Tory front bench , Gordon Brown congratulated him on his candor for admitting it was to ` ` spend more time with his merchant bank '' .
For the last US ambassador to Britain , the low - profile William Farish -LRB- where ` ` low profile '' is just a diplomatic way of saying largely inactive -RRB- , there was no need for such candor : if you plotted his few appearances on British television or radio against his known enthusiasm for horse racing , it was clear this was a man whose passions lay more with the equine than the ambassadorial .
The post has been vacant since <TIMEX3 tid="t50" type="DATE" value="2004-06">June 2004</TIMEX3> .
The new nominee for ambassador , Robert Tuttle , comes to the job with much the same qualifications as Mr Farish : a long record of donations to George Bush 's election campaigns .

<TIMEX3 tid="t52" type="TIME" value="2005-06-13TNI">Tonight</TIMEX3> will see the announcement of the winner of <TIMEX3 tid="t51" type="DATE" value="2005">this year</TIMEX3> 's Samuel Johnson Prize for Non - Fiction at an awards ceremony in the swanksome surroundings of the Savoy hotel .
Despite the prize 's relative youth <TIMEX3 tid="t54" type="TIME" value="2005-06-13TNI">tonight</TIMEX3> takes it into its seventh year it is hotly contested and most definitely one to watch : previous winners of the # 30,000 jackpot have included Antony Beevor for Stalingrad and <TIMEX3 tid="t53" type="DATE" value="2004">last year</TIMEX3> Anna Funder for Stasiland , her captivating account of life behind the Berlin Wall .
<TIMEX3 tid="t55" type="DATE" value="2005">This year</TIMEX3> the judges have upped the stakes with one of the strongest shortlists the prize has ever fielded .
Of the six books to have made it to the final round , the ones to watch are Alexander Masters ' life - in - reverse of homeless man Stuart Shorter , Stuart : A Life Backwards , which received buckets of press coverage on its publication , Orhan Pamuk 's musical biography of his home city , Istanbul , and Jonathan Coe 's life of BS Johnson , Like a Fiery Elephant , which is generally held by everyone who has read it to be wonderful .
We 'll bring you the result as soon as we have it Kirsty Wigglesworth\/PAIt 's day one of Royal Ascot and I ' m in a field in the middle of nowhere and it 's raining .

Michael Jackson 's rehabilitation might be sooner than anyone could have predicted .
<TIMEX3 tid="t59" type="DATE" value="2005-06-12">Sunday</TIMEX3> 's papers reported that Jackson is ` frantic ' to appear at the Philadelphia concert .
Interviewed <TIMEX3 tid="t60" type="DATE" value="2005-06-13">today</TIMEX3> on London 's radio station Capital FM , promoter Harvey Goldsmith confirmed that they would certainly ` consider ' adding Jackson to the bill , if approached by the singer .
Goldsmith added : ` ` Whether it 's appropriate or not is another issue , whether he 's in a fit state to work is another issue , whether he can work is another issue and whether he can work live is another issue . ''
Sean Penn visits Tehran 's cinema museum .
Photograph : Hasan Sarbakhshian\/AP Actor\/activist Sean Penn is in Tehran to report on the Iranian election campaign for the San Francisco Chronicle , the blog Iran Scan reports .
According to Reuters , Penn visited <TIMEX3 tid="t61" type="DATE" value="2005-06-10">Friday</TIMEX3> prayers , scribbling away in his notebook .
Iran Scan 's Afshin Molavi writes : I wonder how Sean Penn will see things .
Will he honestly portray what he sees ?
Or will he be blinded by his hatred of President George W Bush to fall into the trap many a good leftist falls into : defending the Islamic Republic to take a jab at Bush .
Progressives in America consistently fail to side with the forces for democracy in Iran because it might just seem too , well , Wolfowitzian or , worse , Rumsfeldian .
The Chronicle has yet to publish any of Penn 's reports , as far as I can see .
But as Molavi points out , on the one hand , Penn 's presence ensures that more Americans will learn about Iran : on the other , it 's worth recalling the last Middle East country he visited was Iraq in <TIMEX3 tid="t66" type="DATE" value="2002-12">December 2002</TIMEX3> .
And we all know how that ended up .
Also in Tehran is Iranian blogfather Hossein Derakhshan , who is visiting his home country for the first time in <TIMEX3 tid="t67" type="DURATION" value="PXY">several years</TIMEX3> .
It 's a brave act for a blogger who knows all too well the risks of speaking out .
It 's possible that Penn and Hoder , as Derakhshan is known , could meet via the networking powers of blogging powerhouse Joi Ito , if the comments on this post are anything to go by .
Meanwhile events in Iran have taken a worrying turn .
<TIMEX3 tid="t69" type="DATE" value="2005-06-12">Sunday</TIMEX3> 's bombings have hardly improved the mood of the campaign - <TIMEX3 tid="t68" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> being described as the closest in the country 's history - as it enters its final stages ahead of <TIMEX3 tid="t70" type="DATE" value="2005-06-10">Friday</TIMEX3> 's vote .
Blogger Mr Behi says : ` ` Street bombing is rare here in Iran and I can not personally recall one in <TIMEX3 tid="t71" type="DURATION" value="PXY">many years</TIMEX3> '' , while S'can - Iranic calls the attacks ` ` ominous '' .
Michael Jackson is innocent .
We ' ve got audio from Dan Glaister , our reporter who covered the trial in Santa Maria , California ; we 'll be rounding up bloggers ' reactions , we ' ve a digest of what the UK 's papers say ; and we 're gathering photographs of fans celebrating outside the courthouse .
As I write , Tony Blair is speaking in Paris ahead of talks with Jacques Chirac .
Earlier in Luxembourg he rejected a proposal by the EU presidency to freeze Britain 's contentious budget rebate - Matthew Tempest reports here .
In Iraq , there have been bombings in Kirkuk and Baghdad ; suspected Islamist terrorists have been arrested in Germany ; and there are warnings of a cholera outbreak in the Afghan capital , Kabul .
Declan Walsh 's friends in Pakistan often berate him for failing to find positive news stories to write about .
` ` The problem in Pakistan is that there is just so much bad news , '' he writes .
For example , in his world dispatch <TIMEX3 tid="t72" type="DATE" value="2005-06-13">today</TIMEX3> he details the case of Mukhtaran Bibi , who became a national hero after confronting in court the gang that raped her but who has <TIMEX3 tid="t73" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> been banned from leaving the country .
Waiting for <TIMEX3 tid="t74" type="TIME" value="2005-06-13TNI">tonight</TIMEX3> 's Michael Jackson verdict gave us the chance to indulge in some serious TV news geekery .
So let 's get the obvious , cliched response out of the way .
This was the OJ chase all over again <TIMEX3 tid="t75" type="TIME" value="2005-06-13TNI">tonight</TIMEX3> , not quite <TIMEX3 tid="t77" type="DURATION" value="P11Y">11 years</TIMEX3> since the last one , but looking much the same as before .
All the channels cut to helicopter footage of Jackson 's four vehicle SUV convoy slowly being waved out of his Neverland ranch by a long line of staff , and then watched as it made its way along the freeways to the courthouse in Santa Maria .
As those images filled our screens , each of the British news channels was living up to stereotypes in the background .
So ITV News Channel did something cheap - looking , with lots of people on the phone and - it seems - none of their own people actually in California , relying instead on the US MSNBC network .
The BBC managed to be rather more sober and , of course , big budget , with their correspondent going on matters like security and What Happens Next from Live Outside The Courthouse .

Africa 's largest slum , Kibera , where 600,000 Kenyans live with neither sewage nor public healthcare .
Photograph : Khalil Senosi\/AP What effect will debt relief have on the economies of countries left behind by the sudden outbreak of generosity at the IMF , World Bank and African Development Bank ?
Kenya , for one , did not qualify for debt relief , while three of its neighbors and major trading partners did .
That left the East Africa Standard wondering if the country would ` ` lose its competitive edge against Uganda and Tanzania , given their treatments under arrangements such as the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries -LRB- HIPC -RRB- initiative .
Rwanda has been included in the HIPC initiative . ''
Kenya 's frustrated assistant minister for trade , Petkay Miriti , told the paper that Kenya had met all conditions imposed by western capital over time and yet the goalposts kept changing .
` ` It will be difficult for us because our neighbors will be investing that money in services and mobilising trade when we are servicing debts . ''
Nigeria - aka Africa 's richest debtor - would understandably like its $ 35bn debt written off as well .
New World Bank president Paul Wolfowitz made Abuja his first stop on an inaugaral four - city tour of Africa , and Nigeria lost no time in making its case .
The response sounded cautiously optimistic , with Nigeria 's daily Guardian quoting Wolfowitz as saying creditor nations would ` ` hopefully come up with a deal to forgive Nigeria 's debt '' .

But he will warn his old boss that the essence of Blairism is not getting across in Brussels .
` ` In Brussels , Britain has sounded neo - Thatcherite as though nothing has changed from <TIMEX3 tid="t84" type="DATE" value="198">the 1980s</TIMEX3> , '' Mandelson will tell the Fabians .
` ` Both tone and substance need <TIMEX3 tid="t85" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> to change if the British government is to command attention and win the backing it seeks on the continent .
A greater effort must be made to get this right during the UK presidency . ''
What does that mean for Britain 's EU rebate ?
It means , he says , that Britain will eventually have to compromise .
` ` It is surely wrong to ask the poorer new accession states to pay for any part of the rebate . ''
The UK risks ` ` playing into the hands '' of Jacques Chirac if it rules out reform altogether : ` ` Disengagement from Europe at this time would be a total betrayal of Britain 's national interest .
...
Britain would walk naked into the world of globalisation . ''
Blairisme has its admirers in France .
But the suggestion that New Labor has the answer to the EU 's problems - if Tony could only make the Europeans grasp it - is cheekily Mandelsonian .
And it sets the bar very high for Britain 's presidency in <TIMEX3 tid="t86" type="DATE" value="2005-07">July</TIMEX3> .
