How new is ` ` New Labor '' ?
In the heady years after <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="1997">1997</TIMEX3> , the ideologues worked hard to promote an image of youth .
Labor 's troublesome past , they proclaimed , had been thrown overboard along with its commitment to a socialist economy set down in Clause Four of the <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="1918">1918</TIMEX3> constitution .
In place of a history , there was a future .
The party could <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> adopt or reject slogans and symbols according to the demands of its <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> branding strategy .
Hence the appearance of an increasingly bizarre set of stage props starting with ` ` Cool Britannia '' and climaxing in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2001">2001</TIMEX3> with the improbable pink makeover of the British bull - dog .

But that was all before 9\/11 , before the coupling with Bush and the Iraq war .
<TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> New Labor talks little about its former flirtations with the young .
Better to present itself as the authentic continuation of a social - democratic past .
This is the point of Patrick Diamond 's New Labor 's Old Roots -LRB- Imprint Academic , # 14.95 -RRB- , a collection of ` ` revisionist '' Labor texts running from RH Tawney in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="1931">1931</TIMEX3> to Gordon Brown in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="1997">1997</TIMEX3> .
Diamond is a Downing Street adviser and his claim is strongly endorsed by Tony Blair who <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> depicts New Labor as ` ` a party which has returned to its roots '' .
But talk of ` ` roots '' and continuities can also be misleading .
It suggests a soft - focus constancy of identity and beliefs that a sharper look at Labor 's history belies .
What chiefly emerges from the brief biographies and memoirs also noticed here - of Aneurin Bevan , Roy Jenkins and Tony Benn - is the sheer diversity encompassed by Labor and its Whig , liberal and puritan forebears .
Particularly striking is Tony Benn 's moving childhood memoir , Dare to Be a Daniel -LRB- Hutchinson , # 17.95 -RRB- .
Benn was brought up in an affluent home , the product of a family publishing empire and two generations of engagement in London progressive politics .
His father was a Liberal MP who turned to Labor in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="192">the 1920s</TIMEX3> and served in Labor cabinets in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="1931">1931</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="1945">1945</TIMEX3> .
The young Benn grew up with a nurse , cook ` ` and servants to keep house '' ; he came from a family of Lib - Lab political insiders living next door to Sidney and Beatrice Webb on the site of the present Millbank Tower .
The Benns were authentic Puritans .
Ever since the writings of George Eliot and Matthew Arnold , Puritanism has been associated with the provinces , with the energy , ambition yet narrowness of the outsider .

But the metropolitan puritanism of the Benns was no less intense .
The Benn family were - as Benn still is - teetotal .
They were not intellectuals .
His parents showed no interest in whether the young Tony read or what he read : ` ` All my life I have lived in the oral tradition , learning from listening and watching rather than reading . ''
This helps to explain why Benn retains such an unruffled belief in a Manichean world in which the forces of good are in perpetual combat with the backsliding and corruption of false friends .
From the Old Testament stories of his mother , Benn learned to honor prophets , not kings .
In this picture of politics as a modern day Pilgrim 's Progress , Marx -LRB- despite his atheism -RRB- is honored as ` ` the last of the Old Testament prophets '' .
Benn 's parents showed no interest in culture .
They lived next door to the Tate Gallery , yet never went inside .
Parsimony was one reason .
When his father once passed the Tate , what clinched his decision not to enter was ` ` that it would cost him sixpence '' .
But what mattered most was not to waste time .
From <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="16">the 17th century</TIMEX3> onwards , Puritans were prone to keep diaries in order to justify to God their use of time .
Benn 's father kept a daily time chart to set down the number of hours he had worked .
Benn 's own diary - keeping and the assembling of his political life into a huge domestic archive was clearly inspired by his father .
If Benn recalls the Puritan inheritance of Labor , Bevan represented the secular revolt against it .
Although his father was an active Baptist as well as treasurer of the local miners ' lodge , neither religion nor the Puritan ethic left much mark upon Bevan .
Indeed , in later years he combined his socialism with a taste for high living .
Bevan 's education was not a product of home , school or chapel , but of the Central Labor College where he learned Marxian economics and the history of Labor 's struggle .
Like Benn in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="197">the 70s</TIMEX3> , Bevan in <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="195">the 50s</TIMEX3> found himself the leader of a leftwing rebellion within the Labor party .
But as Clare and Francis Beckett point out in their lucid short biography , Bevan -LRB- Haus , # 9.99 -RRB- , he was uninterested in the ` ` self - righteous sectarianism '' in which the Bennites would later wrap themselves .
For Bevan the question was ` ` where was power and which was the road to it '' , a power which he wished to exercise on behalf of ` ` the working class '' .
This attitude resulted not only in the foundation of the National Health Service in <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="1948">1948</TIMEX3> , but in his provision of the best of 20th - century public housing through an insistence on high quality standards in the Housing Act of <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="1946">1946</TIMEX3> .
In Labor mythology Jenkins was often considered the polar opposite of Bevan .
He was the suave Gaitskellite who split the party and so made possible the triumph of Margaret Thatcher .
But the young Jenkins himself was once a Bevanite , only switching to Gaitskell once convinced , like Tony Crosland , that socialism should be identified with equality , rather than public ownership .

Like Bevan unaffected by religion , Jenkins also presided over the dismantling of the puritan moral code which had governed Britain since the triumph of Evangelicalism in Victorian times .
But unlike Bevan , Jenkins was from the beginning a Labor insider -LRB-
his father became Attlee 's political secretary -RRB- and received a good formal education culminating in his time at Balliol College , Oxford , where he mixed easily with the children of the privileged classes .
In this respect he was an early embodiment of the decline of deference and loosening of social mores which were to become celebrated after <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="1964">1964</TIMEX3> .
Gaitskell had felt disturbed by this trend in <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="195">the 50s</TIMEX3> .
He associated it with the decline of the old service ethic of the upper middle class : ` ` Tony -LRB- Crosland -RRB- and Roy are not upper
and I sometimes feel they do n't have a proper humility to ordinary working people . ''

The receding tide of Puritanism on the one hand , and noblesse oblige on the other , also had its grosser side .
Alan Watkins recalls that as a young reporter , lunch with a politician often involved ` ` a large aperitif beforehand , sharing a bottle of wine with the meal and ... brandy afterwards with his coffee . ''
New Labor would probably be as appalled as their Edwardian ancestors .
The thoughtful accounts found in Roy Jenkins : A Retrospective , edited by Andrew Adonis and Keith Thomas -LRB- OUP , # 18.99 -RRB- , that deal with Jenkins 's detachment from Labor after the electoral defeat of <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="1970">1970</TIMEX3> , read more like a tale of accident and misadventure than of the irresistible rise of a new political force .
Like Bevan in <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="195">the 50s</TIMEX3> , Jenkins was a reluctant rebel .
But for Europe and his absence from parliament after the move to Brussels in <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="1977">1977</TIMEX3> , the split with Labor might not have occurred .
The much - flagged Dimbleby Lecture of <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="1979">1979</TIMEX3> was anything but epic .
Shirley Williams described it as ` ` a mildly interesting academic lecture '' .
But electoral defeat and the ferocity of internecine party warfare , spearheaded by an intolerant Bennite left , appeared to offer ` ` the Gang of Four '' no point of return .
Already by <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="1983">1983</TIMEX3> , however , after a spirited challenge at the Warrington byelection and victory at Glasgow , Hillhead , Jenkins was suffering from ` ` battle fatigue '' .
And things only got worse as he found himself confronted by the deviousness of David Steel and the surliness of David Owen , whose ` ` tough and tender '' program Jenkins dubbed ` ` sub - Thatcherite '' .
It would be easy to point to Jenkins 's personal weaknesses in recounting this unhappy story .
But in the end , as the invaluable collection of documents assembled in New Labor 's Old Roots reveals , there was in Labor a collective failure of ethos and aim .
For in the crisis which produced Labor 's defeat , Bennism and the SDP , the hallucinating reversion of an infantile left to nationalisation and Europhobia was only a symptom of a wider inability to come to terms with the breakdown of what David Marquand calls ` ` Keynesian social democracy '' .
This was the belief most elegantly encapsulated in Crosland 's <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="1956">1956</TIMEX3> Future of Socialism that increasing equality could be painlessly achieved through a combination of economic growth and high social spending without a fundamental reform of the institutions and assumptions of the existing state .
This policy left Labor wholly unprepared to deal with it , and in part even fuelled ` ` the mounting inflation , swelling balance of payments deficits , unprecedented currency depreciation , rising unemployment , bitter industrial conflict and ebbing governability '' for which the Wilson - Callaghan years are remembered .
By republishing the incisive essays of Mackintosh , Marquand , Radice and others , Diamond rightly emphasises that the revision of Croslandite assumptions about social - democracy was as crucial as the need to revise Clause Four .
But to get the full measure of this problem which still lurks just beneath the surface of New Labor , we need to set it in a longer time - frame .
For ` ` revisionism '' did not begin in <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="1994">1994</TIMEX3> , not even with Gaitskell in <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="1960">1960</TIMEX3> , but at least as far back as <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="1918">1918</TIMEX3> .
Labor before <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="1914">1914</TIMEX3> did not aspire to power .
It was a party committed to defend the trade unions ' right to organise and secure parliamentary representation .
Commitment to public ownership in <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="1918">1918</TIMEX3> was a ` ` revision '' put forward not by utopians or Marxists , but by sober - minded Fabians and hard - headed trade union leaders , convinced - as was Lenin - by the practical successes of state control of wartime industry .
During the inter - war years and well into <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="194">the 40s</TIMEX3> , there was no Labor intellectual , be it Tawney , Durbin , Dalton or Gaitskell , who did not believe in the superiority of a planned economy with a large measure of public ownership .
But public ownership was not the defining point of socialism .
It only became so during <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="195">the 50s</TIMEX3> when Bevan equated it with a commitment to Clause Four in contrast to Crosland 's emphasis upon equality .
If these were the decisive doctrinal turning points in Labor 's history before <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="1960">1960</TIMEX3> , the period between Gaitskell and ` ` New Labor '' delivered a massive blow to each of these three possible foundations for Labor advance : first , the assumption crucial to Clause Four , that socialist planned economies were superior , widely believed in <TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="DATE" value="193">the 30s</TIMEX3> and still present in the Labor National Plan of <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DATE" value="1964">1964</TIMEX3> , disappeared in the following <TIMEX3 tid="t37" type="DURATION" value="P20Y">20 years</TIMEX3> as the economic inefficiency of Soviet communism became increasingly apparent .
Second , the privileged legal position of trade unions , first established in <TIMEX3 tid="t40" type="DATE" value="187">the 1870s</TIMEX3> and reinforced by the foundation of the Labor party in <TIMEX3 tid="t38" type="DATE" value="1900">1900</TIMEX3> , was discredited by trade union militancy in ` ` <TIMEX3 tid="t41" type="DATE" value="2005-WI">the winter</TIMEX3> of discontent '' and dismantled by Thatcher and Norman Tebbit in the bitter aftermath of the 1983 miners ' strike .
Lastly , Keynesian assumptions about economic management upon which Crosland 's egalitarian strategy depended were destroyed by the economic crises of <TIMEX3 tid="t43" type="DATE" value="197">the 1970s</TIMEX3> .
Seen in this way , it becomes clear that ` ` New Labor '' is not really new ; yet equally clear that ` ` the roots '' to which the party might wish to return are frail or no longer existent .
The question that destroyed the coherence and ultimately the existence of the SDP was what to put in place of the defense of the trade unions , Clause Four or Crosland 's vision of equality .
So far , ` ` New Labor '' has managed to keep this question at bay , just as Harold Wilson deferred the question of Clause Four for <TIMEX3 tid="t45" type="DURATION" value="P1DE" mod="MORE_THAN">more than a decade</TIMEX3> .
It has done so by good economic management , by the wooing of middle England through the black arts of triangulation and spin , and by the modest , but real commitment to the reduction of poverty , both nationally and internationally .
But should the bad times ever return - Iraq and possible economic downturn suggest they might - ` ` New Labor '' would do well to start thinking <TIMEX3 tid="t47" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> about an alternative basis for a politics of equality .
