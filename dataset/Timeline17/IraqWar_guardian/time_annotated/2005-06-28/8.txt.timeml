Rory Carroll ventures out on patrol with US troops in Baghdad <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2005-06-28">Tuesday</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2005-06-28">28 June 2005</TIMEX3> 01.53

The hatch slams shut and the metal monster trundles from the base into a Baghdad night , another roll of the dice for a crew which , all things being equal , would rather be in Ohio .
Through smeared windows the four soldiers eye a landscape of rubble , anti - American graffiti and impassive faces .
No Iraqi aged over three returns their waves .
The six - wheel , 23 - tonne ` ` Buffalo '' is designed to absorb blasts but with roadside bombs becoming bigger and more sophisticated it is a potential coffin , another smouldering wreck to appear on CNN .
The crew are edgy , aware that improvised explosive devices -LRB- IEDs -RRB- , account for more than half of <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2005">this year</TIMEX3> 's US combat deaths .
Wearing earplugs , goggles , helmets and body armor , their job is to drive very slowly in one of the most hostile parts of Baghdad , looking for IEDs .
Aged 20 to 25 , the four friends are ambivalent about the war but upbeat about their role in it and have no regrets about volunteering .
The feedback from home , however , is unsettling .
<TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2005-06-28" mod="END">Later today</TIMEX3> , George Bush will address an increasingly sceptical nation about Iraq , where sentiments have changed since the invasion <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2003">two years ago</TIMEX3> .
In a <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> Gallup poll 56 % said the war ` ` was n't worth it '' .
Enthusiasm for action that has already claimed 1,730 American lives has turned to disquiet , and this is trickling down to the troops .
Sgt Brad Wilson , the radio controller , shuddered at the latest batch of letters from well - meaning primary school pupils .
` ` It 's all , ` Please do n't die in that place . '
My God , it 's so depressing . ''
The driver , Sgt Marcus Smith , laughed .
` ` My mom just got a passport so she can go to Germany in case I get injured and end up evacuated there .
I ' m not sure if it 's sweet or demented . ''
The importance of having strong support back home is not lost on the soldiers , or on General John Abizaid , who commands US forces in the Middle East .
He says troops fight best when they know people are behind them .
` ` When my soldiers say to me and ask the question whether or not they ' ve got support from the American people or not , that worries me , and they are starting to do that . ''
About 40 % of the 135,000 - strong US force in Iraq are reservists and National Guards , part - time soldiers who have civilian jobs and are not wedded to a military career .
The Buffalo crew are National Guards from the 612th Engineering battalion from Norwalk , Ohio .
Back home they are a policeman , a waiter , a student and a church youth director .
In the Buffalo they are targets .
` ` Sure , I ' m homesick , '' said Specialist Sean Hollinger , the waiter .
` ` It 's <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="TIME" value="2005-06-28T21:00">9 pm</TIMEX3> .
I could be out with my buddies watching hockey and ordering some wings . ''
Instead he was peering at a sack by the road with a suspicious bulge .
Spc Hollinger used an orange control box to probe the bag with a 30 ft mechanical claw .
The four Humvee escorts blocked traffic and kept their distance .
The Buffalo 's V - shaped hull deflects blasts but insurgents are getting better at penetrating armor with bombs - often hidden in sacks , animal carcasses or fake concrete blocks - which are detonated by remote control .
This sack was harmless and the crew exhaled as one .
Sgt Smith opened a packet of M&M s and launched into another joke .
` ` A duck goes into a bar ... ''
Minutes later a black Mercedes emerged from an alleyway and stopped alongside the Buffalo .
` ` Put a round in his hood .
Oh man I ' m just waiting for that to blow . ''
It was not a suicide bomber but the adrenaline took its time to ebb away .
Scouring roadside debris for bombs which killed Iraqis as well as Americans earned the crew no smiles from those rushing home before curfew .
` ` People here do n't like us very much , '' said Sgt Wilson .
The crew was puzzled .
The US had toppled a dictatorship and was <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> fighting terrorists .
Why were Iraqis not supportive ?
Not interested in oil or occupation , the four discussed putting a sign on the rear bumper : ` ` Trust us , we do n't want to be here . ''
They were unsure about whether Saddam Hussein was linked to the <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2004-09-11">September 11</TIMEX3> attacks but knew all about WMD .
` ` Weapons of moderate destruction , that 's what we 're looking for , '' said Sgt Smith .
` ` No one wants to get blown up but this is a good mission .
Everybody has to do their turn . ''
The year - long tour was also an adventure with a chance to save up to $ 2,000 -LRB- # 1,090 -RRB- <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="P1M">a month</TIMEX3> .
All four had been blown up at least once .
The Buffalo , shared with another crew , was scarred and dented .
After <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="PT6H">six hours</TIMEX3> of false alarms but no bombs the convoy headed back , weaving and accelerating through a particularly hazardous street known as ` ` RPG Alley '' .
The vehicle shuddered to a halt .
Sgt Smith , drenched in sweat , opened the hatch and took a bow .
` ` Thank you all for flying Buffalo Airlines . ''
His mother 's passport could stay closed for another day .
