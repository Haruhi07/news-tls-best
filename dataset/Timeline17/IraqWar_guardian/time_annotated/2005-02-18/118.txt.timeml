From the first days of the US - British invasion of Iraq , oil workers have resisted foreign occupation <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2005-02-18">Friday</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2005-02-18">18 February 2005</TIMEX3> 00.00
GMT We lived through dark days under Saddam Hussein 's dictatorship .
When the regime fell , people wanted a new life : a life without shackles and terror ; a life where we could rebuild our country and enjoy its natural wealth .
Instead , our communities have been attacked with chemicals and cluster bombs , and our people tortured , raped and killed in our homes .
Saddam 's secret police used to creep over the roofs into our homes at night ; occupation troops <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> break down our doors in broad daylight .
The media do not show even a fraction of the devastation that has engulfed Iraq .
Journalists who dare to report the truth of what is happening have been kidnapped by terrorists .
This serves the agenda of the occupation , which aims to eliminate witnesses to its crimes .
Workers in Iraq 's southern oilfields began organising soon after British occupying forces invaded Basra .
We founded our union , the Southern Oil Company Union , just <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="P11D">11 days</TIMEX3> after the fall of Baghdad in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2003-04">April 2003</TIMEX3> .
When the occupation troops stood back and allowed Basra 's hospitals , universities and public services to be burned and looted , while they defended only the oil ministry and oilfields , we knew we were dealing with a brutal force prepared to impose its will without regard for human suffering .
From the beginning , we were left in no doubt that the US and its allies had come to take control of our oil resources .
The occupation authorities have maintained many of Saddam 's repressive laws , including the <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="1987">1987</TIMEX3> order which robbed us of basic union rights , including the right to strike .
<TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2005-02-18">Today</TIMEX3> , we still have no official recognition as a trade union , despite having 23,000 members in <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2010">10</TIMEX3> oil and gas companies in Basra , Amara , Nassiriya , and up to Anbar province .
However , we draw our legitimacy from the workers , not the government .
We believe unions should operate regardless of the government 's wishes , until the people are able finally to elect a genuinely accountable and independent Iraqi government , which represents our interests and not those of American imperialism .
Our union is independent of any political party .
Most trade unions in Britain only seem to be aware of one union federation in Iraq , the regime - authorised Iraqi Federation of Trade Unions , whose president , Rassim Awadi , is deputy leader of the US - imposed prime minister Ayad Allawi 's party .
The IFTU 's leadership is carved up between the pro - government Communist party , Allawi 's Iraqi National Accord , and their satellites .
In fact , there are two other union federations , which are linked to political parties , as well as our own organization .
Our union has already shown it is able to stand its ground against one of the most powerful US companies , Dick Cheney 's KBR , which tried to take over our workplaces with the protection of occupation forces .
We forced them out and compelled their Kuwaiti subcontractor , Al Khourafi , to replace 1,000 of the 1,200 employees it brought with it with Iraqi workers , 70 % of whom are unemployed <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2005-02-18">today</TIMEX3> .
We also fought US viceroy Paul Bremer 's wage schedule , which dictated that Iraqi public sector workers must earn ID 69,000 -LRB- $ 35 -RRB- per month , while paying up to $ 1,000 <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> to thousands of foreign mercenaries .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2003-08">August 2003</TIMEX3> we took strike action and shut down all oil production for <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DURATION" value="P3D">three days</TIMEX3> .
As a result , the occupation authorities had to raise wages to a minimum of ID 150,000 .
We see it as our duty to defend the country 's resources .
We reject and will oppose all moves to privatise our oil industry and national resources .
We regard this privatisation as a form of neo - colonialism , an attempt to impose a permanent economic occupation to follow the military occupation .
The occupation has deliberately fomented a sectarian division of Sunni and Shia .
We never knew this sort of division before .
Our families intermarried , we lived and worked together .
And <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2005-02-18">today</TIMEX3> we are resisting this brutal occupation together , from Falluja to Najaf to Sadr City .
The resistance to the occupation forces is a God - given right of Iraqis , and we , as a union , see ourselves as a necessary part of this resistance - although we will fight using our industrial power , our collective strength as a union , and as a part of civil society which needs to grow in order to defeat both still - powerful Saddamist elites and the foreign occupation of our country .
Bush and Blair should remember that those who voted in <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2005-01">last month</TIMEX3> 's elections in Iraq are as hostile to the occupation as those who boycotted them .
Those who claim to represent the Iraqi working class while calling for the occupation to stay a bit longer , due to ` ` fears of civil war '' , are in fact speaking only for themselves and the minority of Iraqis whose interests are dependent on the occupation .
We as a union call for the withdrawal of foreign occupation forces and their military bases .
We do n't want a timetable - this is a stalling tactic .
We will solve our own problems .
We are Iraqis , we know our country and we can take care of ourselves .
We have the means , the skills and resources to rebuild and create our own democratic society .
