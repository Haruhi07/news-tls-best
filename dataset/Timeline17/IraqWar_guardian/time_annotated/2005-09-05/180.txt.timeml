If I knew how dangerous it would be , I might have reconsidered taking the job .
Becoming Reuters Baghdad bureau chief after the fall of Saddam Hussein presented a huge safety risk .

But I did n't expect the danger would still be as intense after <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P2Y" mod="MORE_THAN">more than two years</TIMEX3> .
The office , protected by guards armed with Kalashnikovs , was turned into a fortress .
Driving around was only possible in armored cars .
<TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> I know why there was n't a queue of Reuters staff for the assignment .

But I joined the wire service <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="1994">11 years ago</TIMEX3> , inspired by the journalism of the Vietnam war , looking to travel and write .
I joined the trainee scheme fresh from university .
Under the guidance of Fleet Street veteran George Short , I wrote imaginary dispatches about coups and crises - and the verdicts could be brutal .
As I was only fluent in English - an anomaly among the participants on the scheme - Dublin was my first destination with Reuters in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="199" mod="MID">the mid-1990s</TIMEX3> .
The first time I was in the office by myself when a big story broke was very stressful .
My finger hovered nervously over the enter key on the keyboard - then it was straight to the nearest pub .
Much of the organization 's work is covering the financial markets and I was sent to Frankfurt to report the chemical and pharmaceutical sectors .
It was a high - pressure environment , competing with Bloomberg and Dow Jones to be first with the news ; wins and losses were measured in milliseconds .
It was never an ambition to be doing that , so when the Jakarta bureau was short - staffed in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="1998">1998</TIMEX3> I jumped at the chance to go .
I landed at the right time .
Indonesia had been stable for <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="P30Y">30 years</TIMEX3> , but within <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="P1W">a week</TIMEX3> of my arrival , the capital exploded in rioting - for the first time I was at the center of a huge international story and being tear - gassed .
The anxiety I experienced then returns every time I am in a new country .
But it prepared me for the dangers I faced during the <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="1999">1999</TIMEX3> East Timor crisis , underlined by the death of a Dutch journalist .
Thankfully , I was under the guidance of Kurt Schork , a truly inspirational figure who was later killed in Sierra Leone .
From there I was posted in Bangkok , a regional hub covering several countries , which involved a lot of traveling .
Burma was a tragic place to visit , but I was lucky to be there when Aung San Suu Kyi was released from house arrest .
Amid scenes of mass celebrations , it reminded me why I loved being a reporter : to meet amazing people from around the globe .
When the Afghanistan war started in <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2001">2001</TIMEX3> , I was itching to go in .
But frustratingly , I had not completed the requisite training back in Britain .
I rushed home to do it , enabling me to be based in Kandahar , albeit after the fall of Kabul .
The only reason I was there was in case Osama bin Laden was captured nearby , but in reality , little was going on .
In this job you often find yourself marooned somewhere for weeks because something could happen and we must be there if it does .
I do envy my newspaper colleagues , because they have the time to pursue their own stories , confident that wire services can tell the main story of the day as a backup .

Yet I do n't feel in direct competition with them , apart from in terms of finding scoops .
I like the adrenaline ; as soon as something happens , you have to report it .
In Kandahar , though , I proved you can make a story out of anything by chatting to locals .
My war reporting experience saw me sent to Kuwait ahead of the Iraq war in <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2003">2003</TIMEX3> .
The plan was to be embedded with the US military and I underwent chemical and biological warfare training .
But as the war became delayed , I faced a personal dilemma : my sister was getting married at <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2005-04" mod="START">the start of April</TIMEX3> and I had to decide whether to invade Iraq with the US Marines or attend the wedding .
It would have been the biggest story of my life , but I went home .
After the war I was able to go into Basra and from there I took on the Baghdad job .
I do n't think anybody in journalism has experienced conditions like those in the Iraqi capital and faced a comparable level of risk for such a sustained period of time .
The main stress was n't for my own safety - running things from the office , I did n't go out much - but for my team of around 50 Iraqi staff who were putting themselves in extreme danger .
On leave for <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DURATION" value="PXW">a couple of weeks</TIMEX3> , I would try to de - stress in England or on a beach in Thailand .

But I would get depressed when I switched on CNN and saw the carnage from Iraq .
I found it astonishing that I worked there and would question the wisdom of going back .
On my return , I would wonder whether the holiday was worthwhile .
After <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">two years</TIMEX3> in the role - one of the longest serving journalists in Iraq since the war - I felt it was time to get out <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">a couple of months ago</TIMEX3> .
Leaving behind my Iraqi colleagues was hard , because they will still have to live through the difficult conditions .
When I was back in London , I was n't due to be working , but on <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2005-07-07">July 7</TIMEX3> I raced into the office to help with the coverage of the bombings .
I thought I had left behind multiple suicide bombings
and I did n't expect to be writing about them happening at home .
