<TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2005-09-05">Monday</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2005-09-05">5 September 2005</TIMEX3> 00.00 BST A Sunni Arab teenager who died saving Shias during <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2005-W35">last week</TIMEX3> 's stampede disaster in Baghdad has been hailed as a hero whose sacrifice should unify Iraq .
Othman al - Ubeydi drowned after rescuing at least three people who tumbled into the Tigris when Shia pilgrims panicked at rumors of a suicide bomber among them , leading to 1,005 deaths .
The 19 - year - old student 's face was on newspapers and television screens <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2005-09-04">yesterday</TIMEX3> and the provincial council said that a street would be named after him .
Mr Ubeydi was sitting down to breakfast <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2005-08-31">last Wednesday</TIMEX3> when loudspeakers from his Sunni mosque said Shias needed help at the al - Aima bridge , where Iraq 's deadliest disaster since the <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2003">2003</TIMEX3> invasion was unfolding .
While hundreds were crushed to death on the bridge , hundreds more jumped or fell into the river .
Witnesses said that the teenager , a strong swimmer and wrestler who trained at a gym , repeatedly dived in and saved between three and seven people .
However he was exhausted when he tried to save a large woman , and she reportedly pulled him under .
Iraq 's government and media called Mr Ubeydi a martyr of national unity whose heroic sacrifice should reconcile Shias and Sunnis , rival Muslim sects which have edged towards civil war .
` ` He showed that we are all brothers , '' said the Shia prime minister , Ibrahim al - Jaafari , while visiting the family .
Mr Ubeydi 's father , Ali , said that his studious son had passed the supreme test of humanity , setting an example for the country .
` ` He turned his soul into a bridge to save others . ''
One newspaper , Itijah al - Akhar , illustrated the theme with a bridge in the shape of two hands shaking .
Another paper , Al Mada , showed a flower growing from a cactus .
A state television network , al - Iraqiya , showed Shias and Sunnis chanting together .
Um Qasim , 54 , a Shia who lost her son to an insurgent attack , said that Mr Ubeydi was a hero .
` ` We are one nation , '' she added .
Iraqi Sunnis , a once dominant minority , have been marginalised since the fall of Saddam Hussein .
Their insurgency against the Shia - led government has produced escalating tit - for - tat assassinations and massacres .
However , few expect Mr Ubeydi 's story to turn back the sectarian tide .
Though there was no suicide bomber , many Shias blamed <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2005-W35">last week</TIMEX3> 's stampede on a climate of fear fostered by the insurgents .
A subsequent spate of attacks against Sunnis was thought to be a backlash , and a unity rally near the bridge at <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2005-W35-WE">the weekend</TIMEX3> fizzled out .
Shots were exchanged between the Shia west bank of the Tigris and the Sunni east bank .
Saddam is scheduled to go on trial on a charge of mass killing on <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2004-10-19">October 19</TIMEX3> , Iraq 's government spokesman confirmed <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2005-09-04">yesterday</TIMEX3> , adding that several of the ousted dictator 's associates , including one of his half - brothers , would face trial with him .
` ` They will be tried for the execution of 143 citizens , '' he said , referring to reprisals for an assassination attempt on Saddam in the Shia village of Dujail in <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="1982">1982</TIMEX3> , after which more than 140 male villagers were killed .
