Suppressed passage suggests that attorney general still believed invasion was illegal <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P2W" mod="LESS_THAN">less than two weeks</TIMEX3> before the troops went in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2005-03-24">Thursday</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2005-03-24">24 March 2005</TIMEX3> 17.20 GMT
The government <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2005-03-23">yesterday</TIMEX3> tried to suppress evidence that the attorney general believed war against Iraq was illegal <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P2W" mod="LESS_THAN">less than two weeks</TIMEX3> before British troops joined the US - led invasion of the country .
It has removed a key passage in the resignation letter written by Elizabeth Wilmshurst , deputy chief legal adviser at the Foreign Office , on <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2003-03-18">March 18 2003</TIMEX3> , the eve of the invasion .
The remainder of her letter - in which she described the planned invasion as a ` ` crime of aggression '' - was released <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2005-03-23">yesterday</TIMEX3> under the Freedom of Information Act .
The entire letter would have remained secret had not the Guardian published parts of it <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2005-02">last month</TIMEX3> , the FO said .
The passage suppressed <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2005-03-23">yesterday</TIMEX3> has <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> been seen by this newspaper .
In it , Ms Wilmshurst shows that the attorney , Lord Goldsmith , changed his view on the war twice before the invasion .
She says that her view that a war would be illegal was the advice which the FO had consistently given before and after the UN security council resolution 1441 , agreed in <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2002-11">November 2002</TIMEX3> .
She says that was also Lord Goldsmith 's view until <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2005-03-07">March 7</TIMEX3> , when he sent a 13 - page written legal opinion to Tony Blair .
Ms Wilmshurst does not reveal the content of this advice .
However , reports that the at torney warned Mr Blair that British participation in the invasion could be ruled unlawful by an international court have not been denied by the government .
In the censored passage of her letter , Ms Wilmshurst points out that the attorney 's view changed yet again into a new ` ` official line '' .
That is a reference to a parliamentary answer released by Lord Goldsmith on <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2005-03-17">March 17</TIMEX3> , the eve of a crucial Commons vote on military action .
In this , the attorney said - on the basis of advice from Mr Blair - that it was ` ` plain '' Iraq was in breach of its disarmament obligations .
In the rest of her letter , Ms Wilmshurst , <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> on the staff of Chatham House , the Royal Institute of International Affairs , said she could not ` ` in conscience '' go along with the view that an invasion would be lawful without a second UN resolution clearly sanctioning war .
Such a resolution , which Mr Blair was desperate to get , was not forthcoming .
As that became clear , both Jack Straw , the foreign secretary , and Lord Goldsmith changed their view .
Ms Wilmshurst described planned military action against Iraq as ` ` so detrimental to the international order and the rule of law '' .
She also referred to her work , specifically negotiations on the ` ` crime of aggression '' .
The FO <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2005-03-23">yesterday</TIMEX3> cited exemptions in the Freedom of Information Act to justify sup pressing parts of the Wilmshurst letter .
They covered ` ` the formulation or development of government policy '' , ` ` ministerial communications '' , and ` ` the provision of advice by any of the law officers '' .
The FO also referred to an exemption relating to ` ` information in respect of which a claim to legal professional privilege _ could be maintained in legal proceedings '' .
It said it was not in the ` ` public interest '' to release the deleted passage of the Wilmshurst letter .
However , critics suggested the government had tried to censor the Wilmshurst letter .
Sir Menzies Campbell QC , Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman , said <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="TIME" value="2005-03-23TNI">last night</TIMEX3> : ` ` The whole letter suggests that the attorney general went from a position of believing military action to be illegal to a more equivocal view and finally to a conclusion that military action would be legal . ''
The former international development secretary Clare Short told Channel 4 News <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="TIME" value="2005-03-23TNI">last night</TIMEX3> : ` ` I think the government had to try and cover it up because it is so devastating .
` ` The bit that was blacked out shows that the attorney general changed his mind twice in a matter of days before he gave advice to the cabinet when he just said unequivocally , ` My view is that there is legal authority for war ' , and kept from the cabinet any suggestion that he had had doubts about it .
