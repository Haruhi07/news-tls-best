Steffen Andersch , who has jumped to his death at the age of 21 , was a singer , guitarist , activist in the fight against fascism in his German homeland and a passionate photographer of the underside of London .
The youngest son in a family with a communist background , he was often seriously ill as a child , but always struggled back using his musical skills to overcome difficulties .
Together with his older brother Nils , he was a driving figure in the youth ANTIFA in his home town of Essen , organising numerous rallies against neo - Nazis and trying to protect asylum seekers from deportation .
He was arrested for his activities but acquitted of public order offences .
He also joined the anti - Iraq war rallies in London and Amsterdam as a peace activist .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2004">2004</TIMEX3> , together with friends , my son turned an unoccupied house in Essen into an arts and events center .
They invited locals to meet and interact with painters , sculptors , musicians and street artists .
Their initiative led to negotiations between the city council and the young artists that resulted in the establishment <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2005" mod="START">earlier this year</TIMEX3> of a permanent center , providing studios for artists to work , a performance space , cafe and art lessons for local children .
While a cultural studies student at Duisburg University , Steffen was a restless singer , songwriter and composer , playing and performing with three bands .
A CD recorded by one group , known as Snow for Society , is about to be released in Germany .
After numerous visits to London with his parents , starting during his childhood , Steffen began in his teens to photograph the city -LRB- mainly Brixton and Southwark -RRB- and the tube system .
His London photographs were selected for several exhibitions in Germany .
His last photo session , on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2006-08-07">August 7</TIMEX3> , shows Giancarlo Neri 's sculpture , The Writer , at sunrise on Hampstead Heath .
Steffen planned to exhibit this series in music sessions in Germany and in a book .
Most of his music compositions and his extensive photographic work about London await publication .
He is survived by his girlfriend Alice , his mother Annette , brother Nils and sister Kerstin in Germany , and by myself in London .
