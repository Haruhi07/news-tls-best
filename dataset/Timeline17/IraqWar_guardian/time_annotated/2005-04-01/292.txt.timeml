The Guardian profile : Paul Wolfowitz
The intellectual force behind the Bush administration 's neo - conservatives has been trying to charm his critics as he is crowned head of the World Bank .
But whether he can - or will - put US interests to one side remains to be seen <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2005-04-01">Friday</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</TIMEX3>

For opponents of America 's war on Iraq and fans of Michael Moore , one of the most indelible moments of the film Fahrenheit 9\/11 is when Paul Wolfowitz , deputy defense secretary and the intellectual high priest of the Bush administration 's hawks , puts a generous dollop of spit on his comb before smoothing his hair for a television appearance .
Iffy grooming habits are the least of Wolfowitz 's worries as he takes on the presidency of the World Bank .
His coronation <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2005-03-31">yesterday</TIMEX3> was never seriously in doubt - the US is the bank 's largest shareholder .
But it remains to be seen whether Wolfowitz can overcome the derision and anger that have been heaped on him as the architect of the Iraq war .
And , after a lifetime spent trying to expand America 's power , is he capable of functioning in a multilateral environment where the focus will not be Washington 's strategic interest , but global poverty ?
In the fortnight since his nomination , Wolfowitz has worked strenuously to try to temper his reputation as a raging neo - conservative , deploying his not inconsiderable charm to persuade critics in Europe and the Middle East that he does indeed have experience in finance and development , and that he will be able to divorce Washington 's interests from the bank 's .
Many will prove impossible to convince , seeing in Wolfowitz 's appointment evidence of the White House 's intent to use the World Bank to advance US global interests .
` ` It 's a slap in the face , it 's a poke in the eye .
It 's bad for the international community in general , and particularly for people already pushed to the brink in poor and marginalised communities , '' says Emira Woods , a fellow at the left - leaning Institute for Policy Studies .
` ` What this means is that the person who was the architect of the corporate - driven plan for Iraq that failed <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> gets a chance to do that in the rest of the world . ''
Others believe that Wolfowitz , seen as the intellectual force among the administration 's neo - conservatives , was always an uneasy fit at the Pentagon .
` ` When he was named deputy of secretary of defense I thought of a number of positions where he would be even more in tune with what was going on , '' says Thomas Keaney , a defense expert who worked with Wolfowitz during one of his brief spells out of government at the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University .
` ` I thought he was even more in tune with international development and globalisation .
This is a good fit . ''
It is also a welcome escape for Wolfowitz , who has spent much of <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">the past two years</TIMEX3> trying to defend his policies to Congress .
The academic high priest of the Vulcans , as the president 's coterie of security advisers called themselves , Wolfowitz is associated inextricably with the greatest disasters of the Iraq war : the rosy predictions on the eve of the conflict that US soldiers would be welcomed with open arms as liberators , and his insistence that reconstruction could be financed from Iraqi oil revenues .
` ` I think he and the Bush White House have slightly different agendas .
The Bush White House wanted to promote and reward a guy without going through - though they would never say this - a bruising confirmation battle for some other US government job , '' says James Mann , the author of a history of the Bush war cabinet called Rise of the Vulcans .
` ` He sees it as a chance to launch into an entirely new area , and to get away from being stuck on defense and military issues . ''
<TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> 61 , Wolfowitz was born into a Polish Jewish immigrant family , and grew up mainly in the university town of Ithaca , New York , where his father was a professor of statistical theory at Cornell University .
At 14 he spent <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> in Israel while his father was a visiting professor in Haifa , and his sister emigrated to the country .
But he is one of the few neo - conservatives in the Bush administration to endorse the creation of a Palestinian state , and was heckled at a pro - Israeli rally in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2002">2002</TIMEX3> for acknowledging Palestinian suffering .
To please his father , the younger Wolfowitz enrolled at Cornell , too , where he studied maths and was offered a full scholarship , but went on to pursue his own interests in political science , doing graduate studies at the University of Chicago .
There he encountered such leading conservative figures as Leo Strauss and Albert Wohlstetter , under whom he wrote his doctorate on the dangers of a nuclearised Middle East .
Significantly for a neo - conservative , that included the threat posed by a nuclear - armed Israel .
Since coming to Washington to work as an intern in the arms control and disarmament agency in <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="1973">1973</TIMEX3> , Wolfowitz has worked almost exclusively in government , apart from a period of exile during the Clinton years , when he headed the School of Advanced International Studies .
Even colleagues who disagree violently with his view of the world concede that Wolfowitz was far more congenial than the usual Washington apparatchik .
` ` He does n't do what I have often seen in Washington which is treat you like a piece of furniture , '' says Dan Gour , a fellow at the Lexington Institute , who met Wolfowitz <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="1975">30 years ago</TIMEX3> when he gave him a job at the arms control agency .
` ` Even if he was critical of something you had done for him , it was not done in a way that would diminish you as an individual . ''
But despite sharp intelligence , willingness to put in <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2018">18</TIMEX3> - hour work days , and a genial , low - key manner , Wolfowitz has never before held a leadership position .
Instead , he became ` ` the most influential underling in Washington '' , as Mann writes in his book .
Over the years he worked under six presidents , including the Democrat , Jimmy Carter .
But Wolfowitz 's preoccupations have not radically changed since his days as a graduate student : a belief in the importance of military power and that America is a force for good in the world , a distrust of the Soviet Union and of America 's intelligence agencies , and a disdain for the Kissinger doctrines of detente and containment .
Since <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2001">2001</TIMEX3> Wolfowitz has added another pillar to his ideology : a belief that the <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2004-09-11">September 11</TIMEX3> terror attacks changed the world forever .
Clues to the way in which Wolfowitz would respond to that change as deputy Pentagon chief were evident from his first days in Washington .
As a junior official at the Pentagon in <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="1977">1977</TIMEX3> he presided over a project which looked at the possibility of a Soviet seizure of Gulf oilfields .
He also explored the consequences of an Iraqi attack on Saudi Arabia or Kuwait .
To Mann , that was typical .
` ` He stands out for me from many other neo - conservatives for the frequency with which he takes core beliefs and then asks the next question , '' he says .
During <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="198">the 80s</TIMEX3> , Wolfowitz 's interests shifted from the Middle East to Asia , when he moved to the state department as assistant secretary for east Asia , then ambassador to Indonesia .
Supporters say those years convinced him of the importance of using American might to promote democratic change .
He was , by all accounts , a successful ambassador .
But some who acknowledge his popularity also discount the argument that Wolfowitz used his influence as an envoy to press for change .
` ` It is really too much to claim that he played any kind of role in leading Indonesia to democracy , '' says Jeffrey Winters , an expert on Indonesia at Chicago 's Northwestern University , who was in the country at the time .
` ` The real record when you dig into it is that he was very slow to respond to Indonesia 's movement for democracy .
Indonesia 's citizens across the spectrum had been struggling against authoritarian rule .
They had been tortured .
They had been jailed .
They had been ruined in various ways , and the Wolfowitz embassy did n't speak up for them - not once . ''
He adds : ` ` He had his chance , and he toed the Reagan hawkish line . ''
The World Bank will be watching for far more than that from Wolfowitz .
