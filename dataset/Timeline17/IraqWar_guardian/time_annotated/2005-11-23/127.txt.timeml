See a gallery of Sean Smith 's Iraq pictures here US marines in the town of Ubaydi , as part of an ongoing offensive against insurgents in the North west of Iraq .
Photograph : Sean Smith\/Guardian I was attached to squads from the 3rd Battalion\/Sixth Marines and 2nd Battalion\/First Marines as they moved into Iraqi towns along the border with Syria .
The US said the aim of Operation Steel Curtain , which began <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2005-W45">two weeks ago</TIMEX3> and has <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> been completed , was to break up insurgent cells and disrupt their supply lines from Syria .
The marines worked their way house by house through the border towns along the Euphrates .
They had not been in the towns for <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P1Y" mod="EQUAL_OR_MORE">at least a year</TIMEX3> and thought they would encounter a lot of insurgents on the first day .
But they took only a little fire in Karabila and Husayba , from IEDs -LRB- improvised explosive devices -RRB- set off in the streets and hidden in walls .
There was more resistance at Ubaydi in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="XXXX-XX-XX">the following days</TIMEX3> .
The US went in with tanks , Humvees , helicopters and planes .
They swept from one end to the other , searching for weapons .
They kicked in doors or used explosives to get in , or used tanks to do it .
Humvees went in behind the troops with loudspeakers calling on people to leave .
They encountered Iraqis with guns and rocket - propelled grenades .
Two marines were killed , one of them going into a building .
I heard it but did not realize what had happened until <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="UNDEF-REF-minute-PLUS-20">20 minutes later</TIMEX3> .
There was a group barricaded in a house and they waited for the soldier to come in and shot him .
I saw the body of one of the men who killed him lying in the street .
Five other marines were killed when they went to a farmhouse outside Ubaydi .
They were chasing two men , went into the house , and it blew up .
When people saw a ferocious assault was under way , they began to leave town .
Women and children came out carrying white flags .
It was eerie seeing columns of people appearing through the smoke and explosions , with no one knowing which direction the shooting was coming from .
I am sure we will hear of more casualties .
All men of military age were detained .
they had material sprayed on their hands to reveal whether they had handled explosives or gunpowder .
Families were split up and loudspeakers were barking commands .
Some of the detainees came back and some did not .
At Rawa the Iraqi army carried out searches , with US advisers .
They did not arrest all males of military age , only those on a two - page list of suspects .
They found about 3,000 lb of explosives .
They took the detainees - about 20 - to a hill overlooking Rawa .
There were a lot of mines so it took ages to get there .
They were handcuffed all night , with their eyes bandaged .
There was no room for everyone in the shelter so some slept outside .
They were given a bottle of water and a blanket , then herded in the morning on to a helicopter and taken to the base at Qaim for questioning .
