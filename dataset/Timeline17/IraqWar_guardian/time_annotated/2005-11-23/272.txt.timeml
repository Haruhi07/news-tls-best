The attorney general <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="TIME" value="2005-11-22TNI">last night</TIMEX3> threatened newspapers with the Official Secrets Act if they revealed the contents of a document allegedly relating to a dispute between Tony Blair and George Bush over the conduct of military operations in Iraq .
It is believed to be the first time the Blair government has threatened newspapers in this way .
Though it has obtained court injunctions against newspapers , the government has never prosecuted editors for publishing the contents of leaked documents , including highly sensitive ones about the run - up to the invasion of Iraq .
The attorney general , Lord Goldsmith , <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="TIME" value="2005-11-22TNI">last night</TIMEX3> referred editors to newspaper reports <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2005-11-22">yesterday</TIMEX3> that described the contents of a memo purporting to be at the center of charges against two men under the secrets act .
Under the front - page headline ` ` Bush plot to bomb his ally '' , the Daily Mirror reported that the US president <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2004">last year</TIMEX3> planned to attack the Arabic television station al - Jazeera , which has its headquarters in Doha , the capital of Qatar , where US and British bombers were based .
Richard Wallace , editor of the Daily Mirror , said <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2005-11-22TNI">last night</TIMEX3> : ` ` We made No 10 fully aware of the intention to publish and were given ` no comment ' officially or unofficially .
Suddenly <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="UNDEF-REF-hour-PLUS-24">24 hours later</TIMEX3> we are threatened under section 5 -LRB- of the secrets act -RRB- '' .
Under section 5 it is an offence to have come into the possession of government information , or a document from a crown servant , if that person discloses it without lawful authority .
The prosecution has to prove the disclosure was damaging .
The Mirror said the memo turned up in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2004-05">May last year</TIMEX3> at the constituency office of the former Labor MP for Northampton South , Tony Clarke .
<TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2005-W46">Last week</TIMEX3> , Leo O'Connor , a former researcher for Mr Clarke , was charged with receiving a document under section 5 of the act .
David Keogh , a former Foreign Office official seconded to the Cabinet Office , was charged <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2005-W46">last week</TIMEX3> with making a ` ` damaging disclosure of a document relating to international relations '' .
Mr Keogh , 49 , is accused of sending the document to Mr O'Connor , 42 , between <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2005-04-16">April 16</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2004-05-28">May 28 2004</TIMEX3> .
Mr Clarke said <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2005-11-22">yesterday</TIMEX3> that Mr O'Connor ` ` did the right thing '' by drawing the document to his attention .
Mr Clarke , an anti - war MP who lost his seat at the last election , returned the document to the government .
` ` As well as an MP , I am a special constable , '' he said .
Both men were released on police bail <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2005-11-17">last Thursday</TIMEX3> to appear at Bow Street magistrates court on <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2005-11-29">November 29</TIMEX3> .
When they were charged , newspapers reported that the memo contained a transcript of a discussion between Mr Blair and Mr Bush .
The conversation was understood to have taken place during a meeting in the US .
It is believed to reveal that Mr Blair disagreed with Mr Bush about aspects of the Iraq war .
There was widespread comment at the time that the British government was angry about US military tactics there , particularly in the city of Falluja .
Charges under the secrets act have to have the consent of the attorney - general .
His intervention <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2005-11-22">yesterday</TIMEX3> suggests that the prosecution plans to ask the judge to hold part , if not all of the trial , in camera , with the public and press excluded .
