Brazilian did not wear bulky jacket Relatives say Met admits that , contrary to reports , electrician did not leap tube station barrier <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2005-07-28">Thursday</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2005-07-28">28 July 2005</TIMEX3> 18.32 BST Jean Charles de Menezes , the Brazilian shot dead in the head , was not wearing a heavy jacket that might have concealed a bomb , and did not jump the ticket barrier when challenged by armed plainclothes police , his cousin said <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2005-07-27">yesterday</TIMEX3> .
Speaking at a press conference after a meeting with the Metropolitan police , Vivien Figueiredo , 22 , said that the first reports of how her 27 - year - old cousin had come to be killed in mistake for a suicide bomber on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2005-07-22">Friday</TIMEX3> at Stockwell tube station were wrong .
` ` He used a travel card , '' she said .
` ` He had no bulky jacket , he was wearing a jeans jacket .
But even if he was wearing a bulky jacket that would n't be an excuse to kill him . ''
Flanked by the de Menezes family 's solicitor , Gareth Peirce , and by Bianca Jagger , the anti - Iraq war campaigner , she condemned the shoot - to - kill policy which had led to her cousin 's death and vowed that what she called the ` ` crime '' would not go unpunished .
` ` My cousin was an honest and hard working person , '' said Ms Figueiredo who shared a flat with him in Tulse Hill , south London .
` ` Although we are living in circumstances similar to a war , we should not be exterminating people unjustly . ''
Another cousin , Patricia da Silva Armani , 21 , said he was in Britain legally to work and study , giving him no reason to fear the police .
` ` An innocent man has been killed as though he was a terrorist , '' she said .
` ` An incredibly grave error was committed by the British police . ''
Mr de Menezes was shot seven times in the head and once in the shoulder at <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="TIME" value="2005-07-22T10:00">10 am</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2005-07-22">last Friday</TIMEX3> after being followed from Tulse Hill .
Scotland Yard initially claimed he wore a bulky jacket and jumped the barrier when police identified themselves and ordered him to stop .
<TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2005-07-22">The same day</TIMEX3> the Met commissioner , Sir Ian Blair , said the shooting was ` ` directly linked '' to the unprecedented anti - terror operation on London 's streets .
<TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2005-07-23">The following day</TIMEX3> Sir Ian apologised when detectives established that the Brazilian electrician , on his way to a job in north - west London , was not connected to attempts to blow up three underground trains and a bus in the capital .
The Independent Police Complaints Commission has began an inquiry which is expected to take <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="PXM">several months</TIMEX3> .
<TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2005-07-27">Yesterday</TIMEX3> it emerged one armed officer involved has been given leave , and two have been moved to non - firearm duties .
Ms Figuerdo condemned Sir Ian 's decision to authorise the leave , saying she wanted to see the man who shot her cousin , and he should be in jail .
The body of Mr de Menezes is being flown to Brazil <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="TIME" value="2005-07-28TNI">tonight</TIMEX3> for a funeral <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2005-07-29">tomorrow</TIMEX3> .
Simultaneously , a memorial service will be held at Westminster Cathedral , with TV coverage beamed live to Brazil .
Ms Peirce condemned Sir Ian 's statements on the case , saying there had been a ` ` regrettable rush to judgment '' .
She was astonished that the phrase ` ` shoot to kill '' was being used as if it was a legitimate legal term ; the family would demand ` ` transparency '' both as to the facts of what had happened and on the policy .
She added that the family were ready to cooperate with the complaints body , and she saw no reason for delay : ` ` They know what their questions are and we see no reasons why they should not be answered .
