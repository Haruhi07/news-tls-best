After what has been described as the most foolish war in over 2,000 years , is there a way out of Iraq for President Bush , asks Brian Whitaker <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2005-11-29">Tuesday</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2005-11-29">29 November 2005</TIMEX3> 13.54 GMT
There is a remarkable article in the latest issue of the American Jewish weekly , Forward .
It calls for President Bush to be impeached and put on trial ` ` for misleading the American people , and launching the most foolish war since Emperor Augustus in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="BC0009">9 BC</TIMEX3> sent his legions into Germany and lost them '' .
To describe Iraq as the most foolish war of the last 2,014 years is a sweeping statement , but the writer is well qualified to know .
He is Martin van Creveld , a professor at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem and one of the world 's foremost military historians .
Several of his books have influenced modern military theory and he is the only non - American author on the US Army 's list of required reading for officers .
Professor van Creveld has previously drawn parallels between Iraq and Vietnam , and pointed out that almost all countries that have tried to fight similar wars during <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P60Y">the last 60 years or so</TIMEX3> have ended up losing .
Why President Bush ` ` nevertheless decided to go to war escapes me and will no doubt preoccupy historians to come , '' he told one interviewer .
The professor 's puzzlement is understandable .
<TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P2Y" mod="MORE_THAN">More than two years</TIMEX3> after the war began , and despite the huge financial and human cost , it is difficult to see any real benefits .
The weapons of mass destruction that provided the excuse for the invasion turned out not to exist and the idea that Iraq could become a beacon of democracy for the Middle East has proved equally far - fetched .
True , there is <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> a multi - party electoral system , but it has institutionalised and consolidated the country 's ethnic , sectarian and tribal divisions - exactly the sort of thing that should be avoided when attempting to democratise .
In the absence of anything more positive , Tony Blair has fallen back on the claim that at least we 're better off <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> without Saddam Hussein .
That , too , sounds increasingly hollow .
The fall of Saddam has brought the rise of Zarqawi and his ilk , levels of corruption in Iraq seem as bad as ever , and at <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2005-W47-WE">the weekend</TIMEX3> former prime minister Iyad Allawi caused a stir by asserting that the human rights are no better protected <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> than under the rule of Saddam .
Noting that some two - thirds of Americans believe the war was a mistake , van Creveld says in his article that the US should forget about saving face and pull its troops out : ` ` What had to come , has come .
The question is no longer if American forces will be withdrawn , but how soon - and at what cost . ''
Welcome as a pullout might be to many Americans , it would be a hugely complex operation .
Van Creveld says it would probably take <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="PXM">several months</TIMEX3> and result in sizeable casualties .
More significantly , though , it would not end the conflict .
` ` As the pullout proceeds , '' he warns , ` ` Iraq almost certainly will sink into an all - out civil war from which it will take the country a long time to emerge - if , indeed , it can do so at all .
All this is inevitable and will take place whether George W Bush , Dick Cheney , Donald Rumsfeld and Condoleezza Rice like it or not . ''
This is one of the major differences between Iraq and the withdrawal from Vietnam .
In Vietnam , it took place under a smokescreen of ` ` Vietnamisation '' in which US troops handed control to local forces in the south .
Of course , it was a fairly thin smokescreen ; many people were aware at the time that these southern forces could not hold out and in due course the North Vietnamese overran the south , finally bringing the war to an end .
Officially , a similar process is under way in Iraq , with the Americans saying they will eventually hand over to the new Iraqi army - though the chances of that succeeding look even bleaker than they did in Vietnam .
` ` The new Iraqi army is by all accounts much weaker , less skilled , less cohesive and less loyal to its government than even the South Vietnamese army was , '' van Creveld writes .
Worse still , in Iraq there is no equivalent of the North Vietnamese regime poised to take power .
What will happen once the Americans have gone is anyone 's guess , but a sudden outbreak of peace seems the remotest of all the possibilities .
Not surprisingly , many who in principle would argue that the Americans had no right to invade Iraq in the first place are apprehensive about what might happen once they leave .
The conference organised by the Arab League in Cairo <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2005-W47">last week</TIMEX3> was one example : it called for ` ` the withdrawal of foreign forces according to a timetable '' but did n't venture to suggest what that timetable might be .
With or without American troops , the war in Iraq has acquired a momentum of its own and threatens to spill over into other parts of the region .
There are four major issues : terrorism , Sunni - Shia rivalries , Kurdish aspirations , and the question of Iraq 's territorial integrity - all of which pose dangers internationally .
Back in <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2003-07">July 2003</TIMEX3> , terrorism in Iraq seemed a manageable problem and President Bush boldly challenged the militants to ` ` bring 'em on '' .
American forces , he said , were ` ` plenty tough '' and would deal with anyone who attacked them .
There were others in the US who talked of the ` ` flypaper theory '' - an idea that terrorists from around the world could be attracted to Iraq and then eliminated .
Well , the first part of the flypaper theory seems to work , but not the second .
As with the Afghan war in <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="198">the 1980s</TIMEX3> that spawned al - Qaida , there is every reason to suppose that the Iraq war will create a new generation of terrorists with expertise that can be used to plague other parts of the world for decades to come .
The <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> hotel bombings in Jordan are one indication of the way it 's heading .
Contrary to American intentions , the war has also greatly increased the influence of Iran - a founder - member of Bush 's ` ` Axis of Evil '' - and opened up long - suppressed rivalries between Sunni and Shia Muslims .
The impact of this can not be confined to Iraq and will eventually be felt in the oil - rich Sunni Gulf states -LRB- including Saudi Arabia -RRB- that have sizeable but marginalised Shia communities .
Kurdish aspirations have been awakened too - which has implications for Turkey , Syria and Iran , especially if Iraq is eventually dismembered .
With a fragile central government in Baghdad constantly undermined by the activities of militants and weakened by the conflicting demands of Sunnis , Shias and Kurds , the demise of Iraq as a nation - state sometime during <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DURATION" value="PXY">the next few years</TIMEX3> has become a distinct possibility .
The effect of that on the regional power balance is difficult to predict , but at the very least it would bring a period of increased instability .
No one can claim that any of this was unexpected .
The dangers had been foreseen by numerous analysts and commentators long before the war started but they were ignored in Washington , mainly for ideological reasons .
There were , of course , some in the neoconservative lobby who foresaw it too and thought it would be a good thing - shaking up the entire Middle East in a wave of ` ` creative destruction '' .
The result is that even if the US tries to leave Iraq <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> , in purely practical terms it is unlikely to be able to do so .
Professor van Creveld 's plan for withdrawal of ground troops is not so much a disengagement as a strategic readjustment .
An American military presence will still be needed in the region , he says .
` ` Tehran is certain to emerge as the biggest winner from the war ...
<TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> that Iraq is gone , it is hard to see how anybody except the United States can keep the Gulf states , and their oil , out of the mullahs ' clutches .
` ` A divided , chaotic , government - less Iraq is very likely to become a hornets ' nest .
From it , a hundred mini - Zarqawis will spread all over the Middle East , conducting acts of sabotage and seeking to overthrow governments in Allah 's name .
` ` The Gulf States apart , the most vulnerable country is Jordan , as evidenced by the <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> attacks in Amman .
However , Turkey , Egypt and , to a lesser extent , Israel are also likely to feel the impact .
Some of these countries , Jordan in particular , are going to require American assistance . ''
As described in the article , van Creveld 's plan seems to imply that the US should abandon Iraq to its fate and concentrate instead on protecting American allies in the region from adverse consequences .
A slightly different idea - pulling out ground troops from Iraq but continuing to use air power there - is already being considered in Washington , according to Seymour Hersh in the latest issue of the New Yorker magazine .
The military are reportedly unhappy about this , fearing it could make them dependent on untrustworthy Iraqi forces for pinpointing targets .
One military planner quoted by the magazine asked : ` ` Will the Iraqis call in air strikes in order to snuff rivals , or other warlords , or to snuff members of your own sect and blame it on someone else ? ''
Focusing on air power has obvious political attractions for the Bush administration , since it is the safety of US ground troops that American voters are most concerned about .
But , again , that would not amount to a real disengagement and would do little or nothing to improve America 's image in the region - especially if reliance on air strikes increased the number of civilian casualties .
The inescapable fact is that the processes Mr Bush unleashed on <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="2003-03-20">March 20 2003</TIMEX3> -LRB- and imagined he had ended with his ` ` mission accomplished '' speech <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="2003-05-01">six weeks later</TIMEX3> -RRB- will take <TIMEX3 tid="t38" type="DURATION" value="P1DE">a decade</TIMEX3> or more to run their course and there is little that anyone , even the US , can do <TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> to halt them .
In his eagerness for regime change in Iraq , Mr Bush blundered into a trap from which in the short term there is no way out : the Americans will be damned if they stay and damned if they leave .
