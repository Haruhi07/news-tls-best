Play for <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2005-09-23">today</TIMEX3> :
Hair at the Gate Theatre .
Photograph : Tristram Kenton Hair was the incarnation of <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="196">the 60s</TIMEX3> ` ` American Tribal Love Rock Musical '' that joyously celebrated a way of life and that in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="1968">1968</TIMEX3> famously became the first show to benefit from the demise of theatrical censorship .
But , delightful though it is to see it revived , I ' m not sure it gains from Daniel Kramer 's determined attempt to update it .
The book and lyrics by Gerome Ragni and James Rado are still there : it remains the tenuous story of Claude , a New York tribal leader , separated from his gang when he goes off to a foreign war .
And the Galt MacDermot tunes remain as fresh as ever .
Merely to hear once again Aquarius , Good Morning Starshine , Manchester England and all the rest is to be transported back to a time of hippie optimism when the <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2005-09-18">Sunday</TIMEX3> joint was to be smoked rather than eaten .
But , in Kramer 's version , the action all takes place <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2005-09-23">today</TIMEX3> .
Instead of being drafted to Vietnam , Claude <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> goes to Iraq .
Bush , Rummy and Condie became the symbols of American patriotism .
When the tribe wants to protest about militarism it holds a candlelit vigil for peace in the Middle East .
The problem with this is twofold .
Claude 's heroes remain Timothy Leary and film directors such as Fellini and Antonioni which sounds anachronistic in a modern context .
More seriously , the show is a celebration of a collective ethic : a belief that the group is stronger than the individual .
It reeks of <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="196">the 60s</TIMEX3> rather than <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> when the culture induces a hermetic individualism .
Hair is as much a period - piece as No No Nanette and should be presented as such : as an evocation of a moment when sexual liberation was new , and a young generation was rejecting inherited values .
But Kramer 's production and Ann Yee 's choreography have bags of oomph and fill the Gate stage to overflowing .
The actors are also good .
Charles Aitken plays Claude like a stoned angel .
Kevin Wathen lends his chum , Berger , a feverish promiscuity .
Nancy Wei - George sings one of the best and most touching songs , Frank Mills , with heart - rending simplicity .
I had a good time ; and anyone who has never encountered Hairbefore will succumb even more readily to its charms .

But I could n't help thinking back to seeing Hair in LA in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="1969">1969</TIMEX3> when Ragni and Rado were themselves in the cast .
It seemed then the perfect expression of the genius loci and of the mood of young America at that moment .
I would n't deny that protest in the face of the Iraq war is still alive .
But Hair belongs in its moment and , for all Kramer 's skill , I wish he 'd preserved its period flavor .
