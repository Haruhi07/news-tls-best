<TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2005-02-01">Tuesday</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2005-02-01">1 February 2005</TIMEX3> 14.59 GMT Al - Jazeera has been ranked the fifth most influential brand in the world , behind global icons Apple and Google , in a survey by a worldwide branding consultancy .
The Arab news satellite channel had the fifth largest impact on the lives of 1,984 readers of Interbrand 's Brandchannel.com , behind Apple , Google , Ikea and Starbucks .
The Qatar - based network has been a constant feature of news reports in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">the last two years</TIMEX3> as a result of its coverage of the Iraq war and its aftermath , when terrorist network al - Qaida became the focus of American ire .
One of its reporters was arrested in Spain and it has been kicked out of Baghdad by the Iraqi interim government on the grounds that it was a destablising influence .
The network faced controversy again <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2005-02-01">today</TIMEX3> when it was forced to defend its use of a video that purports to show the shooting down of an RAF Hercules in Iraq , which killed 10 people .
The editor of Brandchannel.com , Robin Rusch , said the survey showed brands that were making a big instant impact but might not have the global staying power of ` ` super brands '' such as McDonald 's or Coca - Cola .
` ` The reason why viewers chose it both in the global section and in European and African survey is that it is the alternative news source for anyone in the west to get another point of view that 's not coming to them from their own media , '' she said .
` ` Osama bin Laden uses it as his station of choice to get his message across and here in the US with a population that is not Arab speaking we see regular mentions of al - Jazeera reports . ''
<TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2005">This year</TIMEX3> the channel will move further towards the mainstream with the launch in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2005-11">November</TIMEX3> of an English - language international news channel that will run alongside its Arabic news service and rival CNN and BBC World .
` ` As the issues of <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2004">2004</TIMEX3> hovered heavily around the Middle East and Islamic populations , al - Jazeera 's relevancy soared , '' the Brandchannel.com report said .
` ` Al - Jazeera is viewed as relatively independent within its region and is increasingly gaining mainstream credibility beyond its borders . ''
The channel , launched in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="1996">1996</TIMEX3> and watched by some 35 million viewers , <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> reconfirmed that it was going to seek private equity partners or go for a flotation .
However , a spokesman <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2005-02-01">today</TIMEX3> said such a move was some way off and a feasibility study would be submitted to the Emir of Qatar , the owner of the channel by the end of the year .
Brandchannel 's <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2004">2004</TIMEX3> Reader 's Choice Awards listed 75 global brands and 75 regional brands and asked readers to list the top five brands that had affected them personally , in either and positive or negative way , the most <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2004">last year</TIMEX3> .
Ms Rausch said non - government organizations and charities , such as Tsunami Relief , would have a huge impact <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2005">this year</TIMEX3> due to the <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2005-12-26">Boxing Day</TIMEX3> tsunami that killed more than 250,000 people .
She said the survey methodology sometimes threw up interesting results , such as the <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2001">2001</TIMEX3> survey , which led to al - Qaida ranking 14th , even though some objected to the terrorist group being classified as a brand .
