During <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="19">the past century</TIMEX3> the United States has faced two brutal assaults .
Within <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P4Y">four years</TIMEX3> of the first , on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="1941-12-07">December 7 1941</TIMEX3> , the US and its allies had mobilised , taken on and defeated two powerful enemies , Japan and Germany .
<TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P4Y">Four years</TIMEX3> after the second , on <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2001-09-11">September 11 2001</TIMEX3> , what real progress can the US and its allies honestly claim for the war on terror ?
The answer , tragically and alarmingly , is that they have not made enough .
Not only is terror very much still with us , it is also on the increase .
<TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2004">Last year</TIMEX3> , the US state department reported 651 ` ` significant terrorist attacks '' around the world , three times the total for <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2003">2003</TIMEX3> and the highest annual number since Washington began to collect such statistics <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="198X">two decades ago</TIMEX3> .
Around a third of those attacks took place in Iraq , supposedly the central front of the war on terror , in some parts of which terrorist killings have <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> reached pandemic levels .
Since <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2006-04">April</TIMEX3> , more than 4,000 Iraqis have been killed by terrorists in Baghdad alone .
But the killing is in no way confined to Iraq .
No one in London needs any reminder of that .
And Britain , like the US and many others , is wrestling to balance established liberties and ways of life with the danger that another 9\/11 , or another 7\/7 , may occur at any time .
The assault on America <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2001">four years ago</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2005-W37">this week</TIMEX3> was in every way as infamous a deed as the one committed by Japan in <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="1941">1941</TIMEX3> .
Much of the response to it , however , was not just ineffective but counter - productive .
Faced with 9\/11 , George Bush 's initial response was briefly both brainy and belligerent .

But the initial advantages were quickly squandered under pressure from the ideological right .
By choosing to rid the world of evil - above all in Iraq - rather than to hunt down , take out and politically disable al - Qaida , Mr Bush set his country on a path which continues to dismay America 's friends and to delight its enemies .
In effect , though , he also did Osama bin Laden 's job for him .
The war on terror , with its rhetoric of a battle between good and evil and its talk of a fight that will last for generations , depended for credibility upon the efficacy of American power and upon the accuracy of the US neocon prescription of a ` ` democratic revolution '' across the Middle East .
In reality , both have proved to be wishful thinking - the real surprise being the limits of the US military effort .
America has fought and occupied , but it has not shown that it can rebuild .
The idea that Iraq would set off a domino democratic effect across the Middle East <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> seems even more preposterous than ever - if Iraq is exporting anything to its neighbors , it is violence not democracy .
Faced with a ruthless insurgency , American public opinion is faltering as the gulf on the ground between reality and objectives widens .
Post - Katrina , the question is not whether the US will begin to withdraw - but when , how and , above all , with what damage .
Politically <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2005-05">this may</TIMEX3> be inevitable and even desirable - but we will all live with the consequences .
The most damning charge against the war on terror is that it has been a recruiting sergeant for the very forces it sought to destroy .
As Mark Danner put it in the New York Times <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="2005-09-11">yesterday</TIMEX3> , Mr Bush 's failure to focus on al - Qaida has created a global ` ` al - Qaidaism '' of the kind that struck this country on <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="2005-07-07">July 7</TIMEX3> .
Such al - Qaidaism is not going to go away .
If the earlier generation could produce a 9\/11 in the face of American power , what will the next generation produce in the wake of the American weakness inseparable from an Iraq withdrawal ?
Bin Laden 's organization may have been damaged and disrupted since <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="2001">2001</TIMEX3> , and his dreadful cause may in many places be in the hands of amateurs , but he could never have dreamed that the world <TIMEX3 tid="t40" type="DURATION" value="P4Y">four years</TIMEX3> after the twin towers would look so favourable to his objectives .
