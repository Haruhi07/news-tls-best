US to hand over Abu Ghraib jail to Iraqis <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2005-03-10">Thursday</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2005-03-10">10 March 2005</TIMEX3> 13.55 GMT American forces have agreed to hand over control of the infamous Abu Ghraib prison to the newly elected Iraqi authorities in an attempt to draw a line under one of the most shameful episodes of the Iraq war .
Iraq 's human rights minister , Bakhtiar Amin , <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2005-03-09">yesterday</TIMEX3> told the Guardian that the US had agreed to the pullout at the four main detention facilities , including Abu Ghraib , west of Baghdad , the prison at the center of the abuse and torture scandal .
Two other locations in the center of Iraq and a British - run prison in the south will also be handed over to Iraqi control , although no deadline has been set , Mr Amin said .
He said he had requested the transfer of authority of the country 's prisons from Major General William Brandenburg , the US commander of detention facilities in Iraq .
` ` We have discussed and asked that the detention centres be transferred to the Iraqis .
They agreed to that , '' the human rights minister said .
` ` It is an important sign of Iraq 's new sovereignty that the new authorities take charge of its detainees and its detention facilities . ''
The prison was at the center of a political storm after revelations of mistreatment and torture of Iraqi inmates by their US guards .
The scandal was exposed <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2004-04">last April</TIMEX3> with the publication of photographs and video film showing US soldiers abusing naked Iraqis and forcing them to perform sex acts .
The furore damaged the rep utation of the US army and paved the way for the disclosure of other abuses of Iraqi detainees by foreign troops in Iraq , including by British soldiers in the largely Shia south .
Mr Amin , whose ministry monitors conditions in Iraq 's US - run penal facilities , said the transfer will begin after the formation of the new Iraqi government , which is due to happen in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="PXW">the next few weeks</TIMEX3> .
The transfer would take place gradually and sensibly : ` ` Iraq still needs time and international assistance and training to prepare and control and run and manage these prisons in a fit and proper way . ''
US military officials in Baghdad could not be reached for comment <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2005-03-09">yesterday</TIMEX3> .
But on <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2005-03-08">Tuesday</TIMEX3> an army official said US forces were considering pulling out of Abu Ghraib be cause of a spate of attacks on the facility by insurgents .
<TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2004-04">Last April</TIMEX3> , a barrage of 28 mortar rounds killed 22 prisoners and injured 91 .
The army official said the US would probably transfer only high security detainees in Abu Ghraib to another facility at the US base at Baghdad 's airport , while the majority of the ` ` common criminals '' would remain under Iraqi control .
The US - run prison system in Iraq is <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> bloated with detainees .
More than 10,000 are estimated to be behind bars - the highest number since the insurgency began in <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2003">2003</TIMEX3> .
Their ranks have swollen during the crackdowns by US and Iraqi security forces before and after the <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2006-01-30">January 30</TIMEX3> elections .
However the rounding up of large numbers of suspects appears to be having little effect on the operational effectiveness of the insurgents .
In further grim news <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2005-03-09">yesterday</TIMEX3> , Iraqi officials said that 35 bodies , some shot execution - style , others beheaded , had been discovered at two sites , one just south of the capital and the other near the western border with Syria .
There are three main US detention centres in Iraq : Abu Ghraib , on the western outskirts of the capital , which holds about 3,160 detainees ; Camp Bucca near the southern city of Umm Qasr , which has at least 5,640 ; and Camp Cropper at the Baghdad international airport complex , where Saddam Hussein and the leaders of the former Ba'athist regime are being held pending trial .
A fourth detention center is run by British forces at Shaibah near the southern city of Basra , where 818 people are being held .
Mr Amin said he understood this would also be included in the handover .
` ` After the era of the Saddam regime , where an Iraqi prison was a byword for torture and murder , and the shock of the prisoner abuse by US military guards , a smooth handover would go a long way to restoring the credibility of the country 's justice and penal system . ''
Mr Amin said conditions at the detention centres had improved enormously since the Abu Ghraib scandal broke , and admitted there were no guarantees that Iraq 's burgeoning prison population would fare any better under Iraqi jurisdiction .
A state department report <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2005-W09">last week</TIMEX3> said that human rights abuses were occurring under the interim Iraqi government , including torture , illegal detention by police and forced confessions , though it accepted that ` ` a long legacy of serious human rights abuses '' under Saddam had been reversed .
` ` We can not expect the system to become like Denmark 's or Sweden 's overnight , '' Mr Amin conceded .
` ` Saddam created many mini - Saddams . ''
He said it was crucial that guarantees of human rights in the justice system be included in the permanent constitution that will be drafted by the new parliament .
