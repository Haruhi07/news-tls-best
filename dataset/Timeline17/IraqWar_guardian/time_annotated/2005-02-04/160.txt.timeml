How the right played the fascism card against Islam <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2005-02-04">Friday</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2005-02-04">4 February 2005</TIMEX3>
00.03 GMT Fascism is coming back into fashion , at least in the propaganda wars .
For the right , it comes in the shape of a new word : ` ` islamofascism '' .
That conflates all the elements into one image : suicide bombs , kidnappings and the Qur ` an ; the fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan ; Iranian clerics and Hitler .
The term seems to have appeared first in the Washington Times in a reference to Islamist fundamentalists .
Coined by Khalid Duran , a Muslim scholar seeking to explain Islam to Jews , the word was meant as a criticism of hyper - traditionalist clerics - who in turn denounced Duran as a traitor to the faith .
Usage has gathered momentum among commentators and academics who seek a verbal missile to debilitate those who disagree with them .
They have adopted it as a sort of Judeo - Christian war cry - look for it soon in the title of a neo - conservative think tank conference .
For the left , the term ` ` fascist '' lost its power in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="197">the 1970s</TIMEX3> , when it was sprayed on every authority figure in sight , from the Nixon - Kissinger White House to university provosts to the neighborhood cop .
To make Bush - Hitler comparisons work requires more nuanced historical references - to the night of the long knives , for example , as Sidney Blumenthal did about the dismissal of Colin Powell .
Unfortunately for liberals , those references do n't work as efficiently as islamofascism does for the right , because to imagine the appropriately creepy picture requires a familiarity with German history of <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="192">the 1920s</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="193">30s</TIMEX3> .
Nazism is better known for its death camps than for Leni Riefenstahl or the Reichstag fire , so analogies between the Nazis ' early years and <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> Republican party behavior seem hollow , no matter how strong some parallels might be .
Christopher Hitchens , a former socialist who <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> sits on the other end of the political see - saw , sprinkles islamofascism about like paprika .
He and Andrew Sullivan , a voice of the right , both wrongly receive credit in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="PXQ">some quarters</TIMEX3> for coining the term .
Long before <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2001-09-11">September 11 2001</TIMEX3> , Duran was commissioned by the American Jewish Committee to produce one side of an interfaith project .
Duran responded to attacks on his book , Children of Abraham , by deriding those who sought ` ` to impose religious orthodoxy on the state and the citizenry '' .
In that sense , he said , extreme islamism is ` ` islamofascism . ''
It took <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DURATION" value="PXY">a couple of years</TIMEX3> for the word to seep into frequent usage .
By then its meaning had expanded .
<TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2004">Last year</TIMEX3> , Sullivan cited ` ` five elements that make it particularly dangerous '' , including the ` ` broken , medieval societies '' that foster it , the ` ` unquenchable extremism '' of its motivation , and ` ` the destructive technology '' its adherents seek .
Use of the term to describe Muslim clerics and stateless terrorists has neatly pre - empted any chance of labeling Bush a fascist - no matter how many suspects are kidnapped by the US authorities and tortured ; no matter how impervious the border ; no matter how effective the use of propaganda to destroy the opposition ; no matter how many countries are invaded on false pretenses ; no matter how strongly a minority religion may become a mark of guilt .
