BST The number of soldiers to desert the army or go absent without leave has more than doubled over <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2004">the past year</TIMEX3> , the Ministry of Defense has revealed .
There are <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> more than 500 soldiers whose whereabouts are unknown .
The rise coincided with the invasion of Iraq and its aftermath .
Independent sources said <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2005-04-12">yesterday</TIMEX3> that the war was clearly a factor .
However , the rising trend <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P4Y" mod="MORE_THAN">over four years</TIMEX3> suggests that other issues also played a part .
The number of soldiers still illegally absent <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2004">last year</TIMEX3> totalled 530 , compared with 205 in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2003">2003</TIMEX3> , 150 in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2002">2002</TIMEX3> , and 100 in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2001">2001</TIMEX3> .
The figures show that soldiers went Awol more than 3,000 times <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2004">last year</TIMEX3> , with only a third of that figure accounting for returns to base within <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DURATION" value="P21D">21 days</TIMEX3> .

The largest number of soldiers going Awol came from the infantry , followed by the Royal Logistic Corps and the Royal Artillery , according to the MoD .
The figures were released to Bob Russell , the Liberal Democrat MP for Colchester , a garrison town .
Though he first asked for the information in <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2005-01">January</TIMEX3> , the MoD did not respond until it was too late for him to pursue the matter .
The response to his original question came <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2005-03" mod="MORE_THAN">more than two months later</TIMEX3> in a letter from the armed forces minister , Adam Ingram .
` ` The mere fact they took so long to answer the question is significant , '' Mr Russell said <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2005-04-12">yesterday</TIMEX3> .
He asked for the information after being told by a source that a growing number of soldiers disapproved of the government 's stand on Iraq .
He still has not seen Mr Ingram 's letter , which was addressed to the Commons on the last full working day of parliament and gives no explanation for the rise .
The MoD said <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2005-04-12">yesterday</TIMEX3> that it was unable to comment .
Gilbert Blades , a lawyer representing Awol soldiers , said Iraq was ` ` probably the biggest factor '' .
But he said a growing number of young soldiers were also not prepared to ` ` suffer the indignities and discipline '' of army life .
Justin Houston - Roberts , who also represents soldiers , said : ` ` There 's been a very noticeable increase of not only soldiers but airmen as well asking our advice on being absent without leave , '' he said .
` ` Some are subjected to horrific bullying and run away to save themselves ...
There are huge amounts of reasons but the conflict in Iraq is significant . ''
He added : ` ` When the conflict started we had a very noticeable increase in requests to assist soldiers who wanted to leave the services or had done so without permission .
` ` I think Iraq has had an impact .
It 's not necessarily people who do n't want to fight but people who have found themselves in situations upon their return that they ca n't necessarily cope with . ''
Mark McGhee , another solicitor , said : ` ` Certainly from my experience of dealing with soldiers returning from Iraq , I would be very concerned about the fact that there 's been a doubling up of the numbers going Awol . ''
