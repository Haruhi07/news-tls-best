<TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-05-20">Thursday</TIMEX3> , <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-05-20">May 20 , 2010</TIMEX3> ; <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="TIME" value="2010-05-20T16:41">4:41 PM</TIMEX3> BP said <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010-05-20">Thursday</TIMEX3> that it is <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> capturing 5,000 barrels <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> of crude oil and 15 million cubic feet of natural gas from a leaking pipe at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico , the first official admission that earlier estimates of the amount of oil spilling into sea were too small .
The amount of oil being captured is only a portion of the total because the company is catching oil from only one of two leaks .
BP has also released a video that shows additional unquantified amounts of oil continuing to spurt out of the damaged pipe where the company is capturing oil through a new tube insertion .
The smaller of the two leaks continues to spill unobstructed and accounts for 15 percent of the total flow , BP officials reiterated <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2010-05-20">Thursday</TIMEX3> .
Separately , the Environmental Protection Agency informed BP officials <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2010-05-19" mod="END">late Wednesday</TIMEX3> that the company has <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="P1D">24 hours</TIMEX3> to choose a less toxic form of chemical dispersants to break up the oil spill and must apply the new form of dispersants within <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="P3D">72 hours</TIMEX3> of submitting the list of alternatives .
The move is significant , because it suggests federal officials are <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> concerned that the unprecedented use of chemical dispersants could pose a significant threat to the Gulf of Mexico 's marine life .
BP has been using two forms of dispersants , Corexit 9500A and Corexit 9527A , and so far has applied 600,000 gallons on the surface and 55,000 underwater .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2010-05-20">Thursday</TIMEX3> BP ordered 60,000 gallons of Dispersit -- a less - toxic dispersant preferred by many environmentalists and lawmakers -- according to Rep. Jerrold Nadler -LRB- D - N.Y. -RRB- .
Estimates of the amount of oil spilling into the Gulf of Mexico have varied widely .
BP originally estimated that 1,000 barrels <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> were leaking into the sea , but days later the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration upped the estimate to 5,000 barrels <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> based on measurements of the surface area and thickness of the spill , which was estimated in microns or millimeters in many places .
Some reputable private experts have said that the actual figure could be five times the NOAA figure .
` ` It was always made clear that this was a ballpark estimate , '' said Andrew Gowers , head of BP group media .
BP says that the actual figure would n't change their response , which is to do as much as they can to stop the leak , keep the spill offshore and clean up areas where oil lands .
But some environmentalists say that knowing the actual amount would help determine strategies for cleanup .
Meanwhile , the EPA 's order to change dispersants posed a new challenge for BP , which has been applying the chemicals both at the surface and at the sea floor near the damaged pipe .
` ` Dispersants have never been used in this volume before , '' said an administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity before the decision was formally announced .
` ` This is a large amount of dispersants being used , larger amounts than have ever been used , on a pipe that continues to leak oil and that BP is still trying to cap . ''
The new policy applies to both surface and undersea applications , according to sources , and comes as the EPA has just posted BP 's own results from monitoring the effect that underwater application of chemical dispersants has had in terms of toxicity , dissolved oxygen and effectiveness .
An EPA official said the agency would make an announcement on the matter <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2010-05-20" mod="END">later Thursday</TIMEX3> .
