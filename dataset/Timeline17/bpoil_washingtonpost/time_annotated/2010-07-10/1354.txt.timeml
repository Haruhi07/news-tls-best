WEST PALM BEACH , FLA .
-- Paul Pointer was speeding north along Florida 's eastern coast in a rented Ford SUV , guzzling Mountain Dew , heading to a dock to buy tuna and swordfish so fresh the tails were still curled in rigor mortis .
This was no ordinary business trip for Pointer , who buys seafood for 38 Whole Foods Market grocery stores in the mid - Atlantic region .
At every step along the journey between what 's caught in the sea and what lands inside Washington area supermarkets , fear about the impact of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is palpable : Will the oil creep into the South Atlantic <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2010-SU">this summer</TIMEX3> , imperiling Pointer 's reliable bounty of fish ?
Will this be one of his last big catches of tuna and ` ` swords '' until the oil comes ?
` ` The oil is going to get here eventually , even if BP capped the well <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-07-10">today</TIMEX3> , '' said Pointer , 42 , head of the Whole Foods mid - Atlantic seafood processing facility in Prince George 's County .
` ` I ' m no scientist , but I ' m also not a moron .
If oil comes here , it would be a heck of a lot bigger impact for us '' because fish from the South Atlantic is a much larger part of the store 's seafood sales .
The story of one catch of tuna and swordfish -- starting 120 miles off the Florida coast at Cape Canaveral and ending with Whole Foods customers in Annapolis -- is a chain of rattled players in the seafood industry , all hundreds of miles from the gulf .
The oil spill has inflated how much Pointer spends on gulf shrimp by $ 2 to $ 4 a pound , but his bigger worry is the fate of his South Atlantic tuna and swordfish .
Whole Foods prides itself on selling fish with labeling that clearly notes its source .

But if South Atlantic fisheries are shut down , Pointer would buy more imported fish , which sometimes can not be traced back to ensure that it meets the environmental standards of Whole Foods .
Or Pointer will pay higher prices for domestic tuna and swordfish caught farther north off the East Coast .
Either of those strategies would trigger harsh consequences for other players along the supply chain : When Pointer pursues imports , that hurts Scott Taylor , a partner of Day Boat Seafood , a Florida company that relies on buyers such as Whole Foods to pay premium prices for seafood caught using rigorous environmental standards .
Already , Taylor said , the oil spill has damaged his business , first when tuna and swordfish production in the gulf along Florida 's panhandle declined and then when cheaper foreign imports flooded the market , lowering the price Taylor can command for his domestic tuna and swordfish by $ 1 to $ 1.50 a pound .
` ` The consumer does n't stop eating , '' Taylor said .
` ` It 's just that more dollars are flowing overseas to a different source .
I had one of my customers tell me that he bought a swordfish from a dealer in Boston '' for less than Taylor charges for a Florida fish -- and that fish was from South Africa .
The fishing industry 's woes will only worsen if oil lands in South Florida and the South Atlantic .
<TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-W26">Last week</TIMEX3> , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration released a forecast showing a ` ` 61 to 80 percent '' chance that oil sheen , tar balls and other oil remnants would come within 20 miles of Florida 's east coast from the Keys to Fort Lauderdale by <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-08-18">Aug. 18</TIMEX3> .
Giant Food , based in Landover , said in a statement that the oil spill has ` ` minimally affected '' its seafood business ; a Safeway spokesman declined to comment .
On a <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="TIME" value="2010-07-07TMO">Wednesday morning</TIMEX3> , Pointer pulled his SUV up to a dock in Fort Pierce , Fla. , <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="PT1H">about an hour</TIMEX3> north of West Palm Beach , to meet up with Day Boat Seafood 's Taylor .
A long - liner docked , and Pointer moved closer to see what was being hauled out : First , dozens of slick yellowfin tuna , beheaded , their yellow pointy fins framing their shiny gray skin , their dark red flesh oozing out .
Next : swordfish , also beheaded , with white and pink flesh and tight veins embroidering the white meat .
Pointer needed to buy about 4,500 pounds of fish .
He had to decide which fish -- ideally , the most aesthetically pleasing meat -- pronto .
His delivery truck was leaving later that afternoon , scheduled to arrive at the Whole Foods plant in Landover by <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="TIME" value="2010-07-09TMO">Friday morning</TIMEX3> , so the fish could make it to stores that day for <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2010-W26-WE">the weekend</TIMEX3> buying rush .
