<TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010-05-26">Wednesday</TIMEX3> , <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-05-26">May 26 , 2010</TIMEX3> ; <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="TIME" value="2010-05-26T16:26">4:26 PM</TIMEX3> As his administration comes under increasing criticism for its handling of the spreading environmental catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico , President Obama will hold a White House news conference <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-05-27">Thursday</TIMEX3> , his first since <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-02">February</TIMEX3> , in an attempt to retake command of the message .
He 'll do so as the crisis reaches yet another moment of high risk , both in the Gulf and in Washington .
At the scene of the oil spill , the oil firm BP -- attempting the latest of inventive but thus far ineffective maneuvers to stop the gusher that has been spewing from the gulf floor for <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P5W">five weeks</TIMEX3> -- has begun to pour 50,000 barrels of dense mud into the well .
The exercise , known as a '' top kill , '' has effectively stopped other spills in the past but has never been tried at the mile - down depth of this one .
Meanwhile , Interior Secretary Ken Salazar is scheduled to deliver the results of a review demanded by Obama that gives an accounting of the federal government 's policies with regard to energy exploration on the outer continental shelf , including whether there are adequate safeguards with respect to regulations and inspections .
Obama is expected to announce a series of new policies in response .
The news conference will also come on the day before the president travels to the gulf to inspect the scene and also to send a message of engagement .
With reporters having their first opportunity to put a full range of questions to Obama about the spill and his administration 's handling of it , here are five that should be asked : 1 .
In explaining and defending your decision in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-03">March</TIMEX3> to open up additional offshore areas to drilling , you argued that improvements in technology have made drilling significantly less risky .
Just <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="P18D">18 days</TIMEX3> before the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig , you said : ` ` It turns out , by the way , that oil rigs <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2010-05-26">today</TIMEX3> generally do n't cause spills .
They are technologically very advanced . ''
What kind of assurances were you given that this was the case and by whom ?
What do you think of those assumptions <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> ?
BP is <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> in the position of making many of the key decisions on how to deal with it -- a situation that is drawing growing criticism .
White House officials note the administration is following a process established under the <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="1990">1990</TIMEX3> Oil Spill Act , which was passed in response to the Exxon Valdez incident ; they also concede that the government , effectively , has no choice but to let BP take the lead because it lacks the equipment and expertise to do the job .
In at least one instance in which the federal government has attempted to overrule BP , which was over its use of dispersant chemicals that the Environmental Protection Agency says are too toxic , the company has not complied .
What do you say to those who say too much control has been ceded to BP ?

And what kind of changes , if any , should be made in the process for dealing with future oil spills ?
Salazar has pledged reform of the Minerals Management Servic e , the agency responsible for offshore drilling , which is <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> recognized as having been too compliant with the wishes of the oil industry .
But his proposals -- for instance , splitting the agency into separate leasing , revenue collection and oversight -- have dealt largely with the organizaton of the MMS .
If the problem is , as you have said , a cozy culture in the agency , is it enough simply to redraw the organization chart ?
How can you quickly change a culture that has taken decades to develop ?
On <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2010-05-06">May 6</TIMEX3> , Salazar announced a moratorium on the issuance of final permits for ` ` new offshore drilling activity . ''
Critics such as the Center for Biological Diversity note , however , that this policy has never been put into writing , and that its definition ` ` has become steadily narrower as the Interior Department changes it to exclude whatever drilling permits MMS issues on any given day . ''
And the New York Times has reported that since the <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> explosion on the rig , waivers have continued to be granted for drilling projects .
What , exactly , does this moratorium cover ?
Should anyone in the government be fired as the result of this disaster ?
