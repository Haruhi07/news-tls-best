Explore all of our oil spill graphics to track the spill , see its effects , and learn its possible solutions .
The most critical moment in the oil spill crisis in the Gulf of Mexico is at hand , as BP engineers armed with 50,000 barrels of dense mud and a fleet of robotic submarines are poised to attempt a ` ` top kill '' maneuver to plug the gushing well a mile below the surface .
It 's far from a sure bet .
` ` It has been done successfully in the past , but it has n't been done at this depth , '' Kent Wells , the oil company 's senior vice president of exploration and production , told reporters in a conference call <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2010-05-25">Tuesday</TIMEX3> .
This will be the first stab at shutting down the well since the <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> blowout and fire that killed 11 workers on the drilling rig Deepwater Horizon .
Efforts to capture the spewing oil have had limited success .
The expanding slick has ridden a steady sea breeze onto 70 miles of Louisiana 's shoreline and into shellfish - rich estuaries .
The sight of oil - soaked brown pelicans is <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> common .
Sticky rust - brown oil slathers the grass in the marshlands .
Federal officials closed more fishing grounds <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-05-25">Tuesday</TIMEX3> , bringing the total to more than 54,000 square miles , nearly a quarter of the federal waters in the gulf .
Oil company executives will be grilled in federal hearings resuming <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-05-26">Wednesday</TIMEX3> in a hotel in suburban New Orleans .
<TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2010-W21" mod="END">Later this week</TIMEX3> , Interior Secretary Ken Salazar is set to deliver a safety review of offshore drilling to President Obama .
And then Obama will fly to the gulf on <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2010-05-28">Friday</TIMEX3> for his second visit to the region since the crisis began .
` ` Like everybody , he 's frustrated , '' Carol Browner , assistant to the president for energy and climate change , told CNN .
The developments on shore may be overshadowed by what happens in the hours and days ahead in the deep water , where the only light comes from the lamps of the robotic submarines .
BP 's top - kill plan has been devised over <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="P1M" mod="MORE_THAN">more than a month</TIMEX3> by what BP calls a dream team of engineers from the oil industry and from such government agencies as the Energy Department , the Minerals Management Service and the U.S. Geological Survey .
BP has also logged 17,000 suggestions from outsiders , Wells said .
Huge ships and drilling rigs <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> crowd the surface 5,000 feet above the blown - out well .
Two rigs are drilling relief wells but are not expected to complete their work until <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2009-08">August</TIMEX3> .
Parked in the middle of everything is the command vessel for the top - kill operation , the 312 - foot Helix Q4000 .
Close by will be the 381 - foot HOS Centerline , one of the largest supply ships in the world , capable of pumping 50 barrels of mud <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DURATION" value="PT1M">a minute</TIMEX3> .
Two other backup ships carrying mud will be nearby .
All the work at depth is performed by the remotely operated vehicles -LRB- ROVs -RRB- , numbering 12 by latest count , and operated from the surface ships while BP engineers monitor the process from Houston .
The ROVs have tinkered with the five - story blowout preventer that sits atop the wellhead .
They fixed a leaking hydraulic line , for example , using an ordinary wrench pinched by a robotic arm .
They also removed the ` ` yellow pod , '' the brain of the blowout preventer , and engineers repaired it at the surface before replacing it at depth .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2010-05-25">Tuesday</TIMEX3> , BP engineers began diagnostic tests on the blowout preventer .
This is a critical phase in which the company will learn how much pressure must be overcome when the drilling mud is injected into the well .
It could also lead them to abort the maneuver .
` ` We ' ve got a crack team of experts that are going to pore over the diagnostic data , '' Wells said .
` ` There is a remote possibility that we would get some information that it would n't work . ''
If all goes as planned , a 30,000 - horsepower engine aboard the HOS Centerline will pump mud at 40 to 50 barrels <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DURATION" value="PT1M">a minute</TIMEX3> to the Q4000 command vessel , then down a newly installed pipe to the gulf bottom , and then through flexible hoses into multiple portals in the blowout preventer .
What happens next would be all - important .
The mud would have to go somewhere .
The hope is that so much of it would be forced into the preventer that , even as some of it surged up the riser pipe and into the water along with oil and gas , much of it would go to the bottom of the well .
The well would lose all pressure and would become static .
Later , BP would inject cement down the wellbore to permanently seal the well .
