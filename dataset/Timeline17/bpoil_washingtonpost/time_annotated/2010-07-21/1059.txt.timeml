KENNER , LA . --
On <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-04-16">April 16</TIMEX3> , <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P4D">four days</TIMEX3> before the Deepwater Horizon exploded in a fireball , one of the two ` ` company men '' who oversaw drilling operations on the oil rig for BP boarded a helicopter and headed for shore .
Ironically , he went to a training program on blowout preventers .
Ronald Sepulvado , who had been working on the Deepwater Horizon for <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P7Y" mod="MORE_THAN">more than seven years</TIMEX3> , turned off his cellphone after he landed , stopped checking e - mail regularly and did not read an <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-04-18">April 18</TIMEX3> warning from contractor Halliburton that the well faced a potentially severe gas flow problem .
The next news he received about the rig came in the wee hours of <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-04-21">April 21</TIMEX3> , when his son called him at a hotel and asked if he knew that the Deepwater Horizon was burning .
Sepulvado gave that account <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010-07-20">Tuesday</TIMEX3> as the first of the BP well site leaders to testify before a government panel looking into the disaster in the Gulf of Mexico .
Seated at the witness table in an airport hotel here , he recalled : --
Seeing an <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2010-04-15">April 15</TIMEX3> Halliburton report that said there was potential for a minor gas flow problem on the Deepwater rig .
` ` I just do n't read every line of that report because it 's about 20 to 30 pages long , '' Sepulvado said .
He said he was not aware of any warning to the crew about a potential problem .
-- Being present during an <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2010-04">April</TIMEX3> audit that found that the rig 's blowout preventer was well past its required inspection date .
He said he did n't know inspections were required every <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="P3Y">three</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="P5Y">five years</TIMEX3> .
--
Continuing to drill although the rig 's blowout preventer was having problems with certain valves and ` ` was leaking hydraulic fluid . ''
Drilling at the Macondo well was not suspended because , Sepulvado said , ` ` we assumed that everything was okay .
When the blowout preventer was put to the ultimate test <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> , it failed catastrophically .
Sepulvado said he has been a well site leader for <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="P33Y">33 years</TIMEX3> .
<TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2010-07-21">Today</TIMEX3> , he has a new assignment : helping to drill one of the relief wells to kill the Macondo .
He spoke <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2010-07-20">Tuesday</TIMEX3> at a hearing being conducted by a joint investigation board of the U.S. Coast Guard and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management , Regulation and Enforcement -LRB- an agency formerly known as the Minerals Management Service -RRB- .
The hearings have highlighted a history of delayed maintenance and mechanical problems aboard the Deepwater Horizon .
While questioning Sepulvado , panel member Jason Mathews , of the agency , said a BP audit in <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2009-09">September</TIMEX3> found a variety of problems , some of which had the potential to affect the rig 's emergency preparedness .
He said ` ` a recommendation was made to the well team to suspend operations until many have been satisfactorily addressed . ''
Two other BP company men -- who were alternating shifts as top BP representatives on the rig after Sepulvado left -- were scheduled to testify but withdrew .
One was Robert Kaluza , who was less familiar with the Deepwater Horizon and who took over what was known as a troubled operation at a sensitive time .
He invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self - incrimination through his attorney .
Donald Vidrine canceled for medical reasons , an explanation backed up with documents from his doctor , said Coast Guard Capt .
Hung M. Nguyen , co - chairman of the investigating panel .
BP and government officials moved closer <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2010-07-20">Tuesday</TIMEX3> toward agreement on another technique for dealing with the well , which was capped <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2010-W28">last week</TIMEX3> .
Kent Wells , BP 's senior vice president , said the company would like to implement a ` ` static kill '' of the well , which involves sending mud and later cement into the well through the cap .
The final closing would still have to be performed by a relief well ` ` bottom kill , '' <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> scheduled to begin in <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2010-07" mod="END">late July</TIMEX3> or <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2009-08" mod="START">early August</TIMEX3> if the weather remains good .
Wells said the company is eager to perform the static kill if the government approves it .
Retired Coast Guard Adm.
Thad W. Allen , the national incident commander , said he expected to have a final decision <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2010-07-21">Wednesday</TIMEX3> .
While the operation could speed the final closing of the well -- an important consideration during the gulf 's hurricane season -- it would also leave forever unanswered the question of how much oil has gushed out of the well .
The amount of oil that escaped will play a role in determining the dollar amount the company will have to pay the government and others .
