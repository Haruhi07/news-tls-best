Katrina and the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico brought the Louisiana coast ` ` to its knees , '' New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu -LRB-
D -RRB- told those attending a luncheon at the National Press Club .
Landrieu urged the audience to visit Louisiana .
He also emphasized the need to lift the federal moratorium on deepwater drilling .
He said he would discuss the issue with President Obama when he visits the gulf <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-08-29">Aug. 29</TIMEX3> to mark the fifth anniversary of Hurricane Katrina 's devastating hit .
The Obama administration banned such drilling after the BP oil spill disaster .
Although BP has been negligent and irresponsible , he said , drilling oil is necessary to let the Gulf coast continue providing energy and food to the rest of the country .
` ` We are not limited to ` drill , baby , drill ' or stop drilling forever .
We can do better , '' Landrieu said .
` ` We must drill and restore . ''
The city 's transformation will be slow and dependent on resources , but Landrieu said there will be more immediate transformation in the city 's safety , schools and job market .
New Orleans is also facing a $ 79 million hole in its $ 460 million budget .

New Orleans , he said , is a city ripe for innovation .
` ` Our future is not just about survival , '' Landrieu said .
