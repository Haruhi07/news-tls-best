How dead is the Gulf of Mexico ?
It is perhaps the most important question of the BP oil spill -- but scientists do n't appear close to answering it despite a historically vast effort .
In the 21\/<TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P2M">2 months</TIMEX3> since the spill began , the gulf has been examined by an armada of researchers -- from federal agencies , universities and nonprofit groups .
They have brought back vivid snapshots of a sea under stress : sharks and other deep - water fish suddenly appearing near shore , oil - soaked marshes turning deathly brown , clouds of oil swirling in deep water .
But , with key gaps remaining in their data , there is wide disagreement about the big picture .
Some researchers have concluded that the gulf is being spared an ecological disaster .
Others think ecosystems that were already in trouble before the spill are <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> being pushed toward a brink .
` ` The distribution of the oil , it 's bigger and uglier than we had hoped , '' said Roger Helm , a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service official and the lead scientist studying the spill for the Interior Department .
` ` The possibility of having significant changes in the food chain , over some period of time , is very real .
The possibility of marshes disappearing ... is very real . ''
Helm said that his prognosis for the spill had worsened in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-W26">the past week</TIMEX3> -- as the amount of oily shoreline increased from Louisiana to Florida , despite cleanup efforts .
` ` This just outstrips everybody 's capability '' to clean it up , he said .
This research has mainly occurred in the background , as public attention has focused on the ` ` open - heart surgery '' at BP 's leaking wellhead .
The patient is a 600,000 - square - mile sea , which contains swirling currents , sun - baked salt marshes and dark , cold canyons patrolled by sperm whales .
Complicating matters is that even before the spill began in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010-04" mod="END">late April</TIMEX3> , the patient was already sick .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent years</TIMEX3> , Louisiana has been losing a football field 's worth of its fertile marshes to erosion every <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="PT38M">38 minutes</TIMEX3> .
In the gulf itself , pollutants coming from the Mississippi 's vast watershed helped feed a low - oxygen ` ` dead zone '' bigger than the entire Chesapeake Bay .
Measuring the spill 's damage , then , requires distinguishing it from the damage done by these other man - made problems .
So far , even the simplest - sounding attempts to measure the spill 's impact have turned out to be complex .
The official toll of dead birds is about 1,200 , a fraction of the 35,000 discovered after the Exxon Valdez spill in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="1989">1989</TIMEX3> .
But this , too , has been called into question .
Officials can only count the birds they can find , and many think a number of oily birds have sought refuge in the marshes .
` ` It 's an instinctive response : They 're hiding from predators while they recover , '' said Kerry St. P , head of a government program that oversees Louisiana 's Barataria Bay marshes .
` ` They plan to recover , of course , and they do n't .
They just die . ''
