In <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P77D">the 77 days</TIMEX3> since oil from the ruptured Deepwater Horizon began to gush into the Gulf of Mexico , BP has skimmed or burned about 60 percent of the amount it promised regulators it could remove in a single day .
The disparity between what BP promised in its <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-03-24">March 24</TIMEX3> filing with federal regulators and the amount of oil recovered since the <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> explosion underscores what some officials and environmental groups call a misleading numbers game that has led to widespread confusion about the extent of the spill and the progress of the recovery .
` ` It 's clear they overreached , '' said John F. Young Jr. , council chairman in Louisiana 's Jefferson Parish .
` ` I think the federal government should have at the very least picked up a phone and started asking some questions and challenged them about the accuracy of that number and tested the veracity of that claim . ''
In a <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-03">March</TIMEX3> report that was not questioned by federal officials , BP said it had the capacity to skim and remove 491,721 barrels of oil <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EACH">each day</TIMEX3> in the event of a major spill .
As of <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010-07-05">Monday</TIMEX3> , with about 2 million barrels released into the gulf , the skimming operations that were touted as key to preventing environmental disaster have averaged less than 900 barrels <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> .
Skimming has captured only 67,143 barrels , and BP has relied on burning to remove 238,095 barrels .
Most of the oil recovered -- about 632,410 barrels -- was captured directly at the site of the leaking well .
BP officials declined to comment on the validity of early skimming projections , stressing instead the company 's commitment to building relief wells intended to shut down the still - gushing well .
` ` The numbers are what they are , '' said BP spokesman Toby Odone .
` ` At some point , we will look back and say why the numbers ended up this way .
That 's for the future .
<TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Right now</TIMEX3> , we are doing all we can to capture and collect the oil through various methods .
We will make sure all the oil is ultimately dealt with . ''
BP began downgrading expectations only <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="P2D">two days</TIMEX3> after the rig explosion .
Although its projections reported to the federal government were only weeks old , the company cited a greatly reduced number in a news release filed with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission .
It projected that it had ` ` skimming capacity of more than 171,000 barrels per day , with more available if needed . ''
The release presented an optimistic picture of a company scrambling to clean up the mess , mobilizing a ` ` flotilla of vessels and resources that includes : significant mechanical recovery capacity . ''
In truth , the skimming effort was hampered from the start by numerous factors , including the slow response of emergency workers , inadequate supplies and equipment , untrained cleanup crews and inclement weather .
Greatly compounding the problem was the nature of the spill , with much of the oil never surfacing .
The poor results of the skimming operations have led to a desperate search for solutions .
The world 's largest skimmer , owned by the Taiwanese , is on site and undergoing Coast Guard safety tests .
The 10 - story - high ship , which is the length of three football fields , was touted as having the ability to remove oil at the rate of tens of thousands of barrels <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EVERY">every day</TIMEX3> .
Thus far , it has been unable to produce those results in the gulf .
