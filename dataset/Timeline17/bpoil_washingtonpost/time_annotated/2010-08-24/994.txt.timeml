The Gulf of Mexico ecosystem was ready and waiting for something like the Deepwater Horizon blowout and seems to have made the most of it , a new scientific study suggests .
Petroleum - eating bacteria - which had dined for eons on oil seeping naturally through the seafloor - proliferated in the cloud of oil that drifted underwater for months after the <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> accident .
They not only outcompeted fellow microbes , they each ramped up their own internal metabolic machinery to digest the oil as efficiently as possible .
The result was a nature - made cleanup crew capable of reducing that reduced the amount of oil amounts in the undersea ` ` plume '' by half about <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="SET" value="P3D" quant="EVERY">every three days</TIMEX3> , according to research published online <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010-08-24">Tuesday</TIMEX3> by the journal Science .
The findings , by a team of scientists led by Terry C. Hazen of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California , help explain one of the biggest mysteries a mystery of the disaster : Where has all the oil gone ?
` ` What we know about the degradation rates fits with what we are seeing in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="P3W">the last three weeks</TIMEX3> , '' Hazen said .
` ` We ' ve gone out to the sites , and we do n't find any oil , but we do find the bacteria . ''
The species dominating the digestion of the oil is a newly discovered one , Hazen said .
The findings point to a different conclusion from that drawn by readers of a study published <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2010-W33">last week</TIMEX3> , also in the journal Science .
That research by scientists at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute found no reduction in the oxygen content of the gigantic oil plume , suggesting that microbes were consuming the oil very slowly .
The Berkeley team study published <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2010-08-24">Tuesday</TIMEX3> also indicates indirectly that dispersants used to break the wellhead stream of oil into a mass of submicroscopic particles might have speeded the cleanup .
By increasing the surface area between oil and water , the dispersants seem to have provided the deep - sea microbes greater access to this unusual food source .
Alan Mearns , a senior staff scientist in the emergency response of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , called the Berkeley team study ` ` critical to the understanding of the fate of what remains in the Gulf .
This study shows that microbes are quickly degrading some components of subsurface oil found in the deep ocean without creating hazardous dead zones . ''
Some of the spill 's 206 million gallons of oil has come ashore , some has sunk into bottom sediments , and a little is still a floating froth .
But the mile - wide , 650 - foot - high oil cloud of oil that for months drifted 4,000 feet underwater seems to have disappeared in <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="P6W">the six weeks</TIMEX3> since the well was plugged .
The plume 's whereabouts has been a contentious matter .
In tThe Woods Hole study , scientists described finding an undersea oil cloud <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2010-06-23">June 23</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2010-06-27">27</TIMEX3> similar to the one Hazen and his colleagues found between <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2010-05-25">May 25</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2010-06-02">June 2</TIMEX3> - which was similar to one found soon after by people from the Monterey cents Bay Aquarium Research Institute .
