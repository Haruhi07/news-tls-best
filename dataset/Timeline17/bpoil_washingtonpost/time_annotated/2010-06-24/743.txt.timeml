Allen Kruse had been a charter fishing boat captain for <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DURATION" value="P2DE" mod="MORE_THAN">more than two decades</TIMEX3> -- long enough that people called him by his boat 's name , Rookie , as if they were one and the same .

But then , <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-04">two months ago</TIMEX3> , the leaking BP oil well began pouring crude into the waters where he took families fishing for snapper and amberjack .
<TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P2W">Two weeks</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-06-22">two days ago</TIMEX3> , with his fishing grounds closed , Kruse , 55 , took a job working for BP 's cleanup crew .

For the very people who 'd caused the mess .
Other boat captains said Kruse , like them , found the effort confusing , overly bureaucratic and frustrating .
He told them to keep their heads down , not to worry about the hassles .
But those close to him saw he was losing weight .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="TIME" value="2010-06-23TMO">Wednesday morning</TIMEX3> , Kruse drove to his boat as usual .
As the deckhands prepared for the day 's work , Kruse , as the captain , was supposed to turn on the generator .
But after <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="PTXM">a few minutes</TIMEX3> , the crew members said , they did n't hear anything and went looking for him .
A deckhand found him in the wheelhouse , shot in the head .
The Baldwin County , Ala. , coroner 's office called his death an apparent suicide and said Kruse did n't leave a note .
There 's no way to be sure why he would have taken his life .
But his friends see the tragedy as a clear sign of the BP spill 's hidden psychological toll on the Gulf Coast , an awful feeling of helplessness that descends on people used to hard work and independence .
` ` We 're helping cover up the lie .
We 're burying ourselves .
We 're helping them cover up the -LRB- expletive -RRB-
that 's putting us out of work , '' said a 27 - year - old deckhand who was working for Kruse on <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-06-23">Wednesday</TIMEX3> and spoke on condition of anonymity .
He said Kruse was facing the same problems as others in his business : ` ` It 's just setting in with 'em , you know ; reality 's kicking in .

And there 's a lot of people that are n't as happy as they used to be . ''
Around the gulf , social service providers are dealing with a rising tide of mental health crises .
Groups of Baptists are deploying extra chaplains in parishes along the coast .
In southern Louisiana , where the impact was felt first , about 1,500 people have received counseling services from Catholic Charities .
From past disasters , such as the Exxon Valdez oil spill in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="1989">1989</TIMEX3> , health experts say they expect a wave of physical health problems , such as high blood pressure and heart disease .
But they also expect more - subtle problems , as people absorb the spill 's impact on their lives : depression , anxiety , alcohol and drug abuse , domestic issues .
` ` We 're seeing already an increase in suspiciousness , arguing , domestic violence ...
We 're already having reports of increased drinking , anxiety , anger and avoidance , '' Howard J. Osofsky of the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center in New Orleans said during a two - day hearing <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2010-W25">this week</TIMEX3> on the physical and emotional impact of the spill .
Michele Many , a social worker who helps fishermen 's wives , said the stress of the spill is compounded by its uncertainty .
Oil is still pouring out , spreading , with an unmanageable toxicity that evokes comparisons to disease .
` ` The oil spill is like a cancer or tumor , '' said Many , who works at Louisiana State University .
` ` It is creeping and unpredictable from whether people will have livelihoods or health issues later from helping clean it up .
You just do n't know whether it is benign or malignant . ''
In Lafitte , La. , 200 hundred miles from the marina where Kruse died , Claudia Helmer heard about the suicide <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="TIME" value="2010-06-23TAF">Wednesday afternoon</TIMEX3> .
