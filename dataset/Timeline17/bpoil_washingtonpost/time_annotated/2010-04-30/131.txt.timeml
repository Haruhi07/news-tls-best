Bobby Jindal -LRB- R -RRB- expressed alarm that prevention efforts so far have been ineffective , and he demanded that the federal government and oil giant BP uphold their commitments to help avert an environmental disaster .
In an afternoon news conference with Obama administration officials , Jindal said he was worried that miles of booms deployed offshore are ` ` not effective '' in preventing oil from damaging coastal areas , wildlife and the livelihoods of fishermen .
He announced that he is seeking to mobilize 6,000 National Guard soldiers and airmen for <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P90D">90 days</TIMEX3> of duty to help provide security and support the response to the oil spill .
` ` I do have concerns that BP 's <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> resources are not adequate '' to meet three main challenges from the disaster : stopping the leak of oil from a damaged undersea well , protecting the coast and carrying out a swift cleanup .
Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano , who visited the area with Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and other federal officials , stressed that BP , which owns the leaking oil , is ` ` the responsible party '' under U.S. law and is ` ` required to fund the cost of cleanup operations . ''
She urged the company to ` ` leverage additional assets '' for the effort .
` ` We have anticipated and planned for a worst - case scenario from day one , '' Napolitano said .
She said the administration is using all available resources to respond to the disaster .
Earlier , the White House pledged not to expand offshore oil drilling until federal investigations are completed into what caused the Deepwater Horizon rig to explode <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> and sink into the gulf <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2010-04-22">two days later</TIMEX3> .
With the edge of the massive spill reaching the U.S. coastline <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2010-04-29" mod="END">late Thursday</TIMEX3> , and bad weather triggering a coastal flood warning , the crisis is threatening to eclipse the Exxon Valdez as the nation 's worst environmental disaster in decades .
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton suggested that cleanup efforts could end up costing billions of dollars .
Coast Guard crews patrolled coastal marshes in southeastern Louisiana on <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2010-04-30">Friday</TIMEX3> in search of areas where the oil has flowed in , the Associated Press reported , and the state of Louisiana diverted thousands of gallons of fresh water from the Mississippi River to try to flush out the wetlands .
Weather was complicating the effort to control the oil spill .
The National Weather Service issued a flood warning for the Louisiana coast from <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2010-04-30">Friday</TIMEX3> until <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="TIME" value="2010-04-25TEV">Sunday evening</TIMEX3> and said waves of six to seven feet were pushing tides several feet above normal .
The service also cautioned small craft to expect ` ` strong winds and hazardous seas '' through <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2010-W16-WE">the weekend</TIMEX3> off the shores of Mississippi and Louisiana .
It forecast winds of 17 to 29 mph with occasional gusts to 38 mph .
` ` Seas are expected to build to 13 feet by <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="TIME" value="2010-04-24TNI">Saturday night</TIMEX3> in the outer coastal waters and near 9 feet in the near shore waters , '' an advisory said , with ` ` steep breaking waves in shoal areas . ''
The rough seas slowed efforts by a flotilla of ships to skim the oily mixture from the water 's surface , federal officials said .
The Pentagon is sending two C-130 Hercules cargo planes to Mississippi to aid in the cleanup , by dumping chemical dispersants on the water .
A number of civilian planes have already been doing the same job .
