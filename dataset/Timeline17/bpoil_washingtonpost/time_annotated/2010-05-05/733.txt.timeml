Oil execs in Senate hearing as gulf oil spill cleanup efforts continue -- photos Oil companies stress one another 's failures in a Senate hearing as cleanup and containment efforts continue in the Gulf of Mexico , after the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> .

The urgent question along the polluted Gulf of Mexico : How bad will this get ?
No one knows , but with <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EACH">each day</TIMEX3> that the leaking oil well a mile below the surface remains uncapped , scientists and energy industry observers are imagining outcomes that range from bad to worse to worst , with some forecasting a calamity of historic proportions .
Executives from oil giant BP and other energy companies , meanwhile , shared their own worst - case scenario in a Capitol Hill meeting with lawmakers , saying that if they fail to close the well , the spill could increase from an estimated 5,000 barrels <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> to 40,000 barrels or possibly even 60,000 barrels .
Three scientists in separate interviews <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-05-04">Tuesday</TIMEX3> said the gulf 's ` ` loop <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> , '' a powerful conveyor belt that extends about 3,000 feet deep , will almost surely take the oil down through the eastern gulf to the Straits of Florida , <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P1W">a week</TIMEX3> - long trip , roughly .
The oil would then hang a sharp left , riding the Florida <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Current</TIMEX3> past the Keys and north again , directly into the Gulf Stream , which could carry it within spitting distance of Palm Beach and up the East Coast to Cape Hatteras , N.C.
For the moment , the oil flowing from the blown - out well in what the industry calls Mississippi Canyon Block 252 is still many miles north of the loop <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> .
A three - day forecast by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration does not show the oil and the <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> crossing paths .

But Robert Weisberg , an oceanographer at the University of South Florida who has been monitoring the situation , said a new filament of the <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> is reaching toward the oil slick .
` ` The loop <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> is actually going to the oil , versus the oil going to the loop <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> , '' Weisberg said .
The crisis in the gulf is shot through with guesses , rough estimates and murky figures .
Whether the oil blows onshore depends on fickle winds .
This oil slick has been elusive and enigmatic , lurking off the coast of Louisiana for <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="PXD">many days</TIMEX3> as if choosing its moment of attack .
It has changed sizes :
In rough , churning seas , the visible slick at the surface has shrunk in <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent days</TIMEX3> .
The oil by its nature is hard to peg .
It 's not a single , coherent blob but rather an irregular , amoeba - shaped expanse that in some places forms a thin sheen on the water and in other locations is braided and stretched into tendrils of thick , orange - brown gunk .
There may be a large plume of oil in the water column , unseen .
A BP executive said the company has had success in treating the oil at the point of the leak with dispersant chemicals sprayed by a robotic submarine .
A federal fleet has fought high waves in attempts to skim or burn the oil .
Rough weather has actually been a blessing , said Ian MacDonald , an oceanography professor at Florida State University .
In heavy surf , the oil has been breaking up , and toxic , volatile substances have been evaporating .
` ` It chews up the oil ; some of it sinks , '' MacDonald said .
The good news ends there .
` ` What remains forms what 's called mousse , which is like chocolate mousse .
It 's an emulsion , which is an emulsion of oil , air and water , in a thick , gelatinous layer , and that 's nasty stuff , '' MacDonald said .
No one is sure how much oil is spilling .
An early estimate by the Coast Guard of a 1,000 - barrel - a - day flow was upped to 5,000 barrels with the discovery of an additional leak , but officials <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> caution against giving any estimate too much credence .
