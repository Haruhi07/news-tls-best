Oil execs in Senate hearing as gulf oil spill cleanup efforts continue -- photos Oil companies stress one another 's failures in a Senate hearing as cleanup and containment efforts continue in the Gulf of Mexico , after the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> .
View how tourism , commerce and the coastline are all at risk .
The Interior Department exempted BP 's calamitous Gulf of Mexico drilling operation from a detailed environmental impact analysis <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2009">last year</TIMEX3> , according to government documents , after three reviews of the area concluded that a massive oil spill was unlikely .
<TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> , environmentalists and some key senators are calling for a reassessment of safety requirements for offshore drilling .
Sen. Judd Gregg -LRB- R - N.H. -RRB- , who has supported offshore oil drilling in the past , said , ` ` I suspect you 're going to see an entirely different regime once people have a chance to sit back and take a look at how do we anticipate and clean up these potential environmental consequences '' from drilling .
BP spokesman Toby Odone said the company 's appeal for NEPA waivers in the past ` ` was based on the spill and incident - response history in the Gulf of Mexico . ''
Once the various investigations of the new spill have been completed , he added , ` ` the causes of this incident can be applied to determine any changes in the regulatory regime that are required to protect the environment . ''
` ` I ' m of the opinion that boosterism breeds complacency and complacency breeds disaster , '' said Rep. Edward J. Markey -LRB-
D - Mass .
-RRB- ` ` That , in my opinion , is what happened . ''
Jack Gerard , president of the American Petroleum Institute , said it is important to learn the cause of the accident before pursuing a major policy change .
` ` While the conversation has shifted , the energy reality has not , '' Gerard said .
` ` The American economy still relies on oil and gas . ''
While the MMS assessed the environmental impact of drilling in the central and western Gulf of Mexico on three occasions in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2007">2007</TIMEX3> -- including a specific evaluation of BP 's Lease 206 at Deepwater Horizon -- in each case it played down the prospect of a major blowout .
In one assessment , the agency estimated that ` ` a large oil spill '' from a platform would not exceed a total of 1,500 barrels and that a ` ` deepwater spill , '' occurring ` ` offshore of the inner Continental shelf , '' would not reach the coast .
In another assessment , it defined the most likely large spill as totaling 4,600 barrels and forecast that it would largely dissipate within <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P10D">10 days</TIMEX3> and would be unlikely to make landfall .
` ` They never did an analysis that took into account what turns out to be the very real possibility of a serious spill , '' said Holly Doremus , a law professor at the University of California at Berkeley who has reviewed the documents .
The MMS mandates that companies drilling in some areas identify under NEPA what could reduce a project 's environmental impact .

But Interior Department spokesman Matt Lee - Ashley said the service grants between 250 and 400 waivers <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> for Gulf of Mexico projects .
He added that Interior has <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> established the ` ` first ever '' board to examine safety procedures for offshore drilling .
It will report back within <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P30D">30 days</TIMEX3> on BP 's oil spill and will conduct ` ` a broader review of safety issues , '' Lee - Ashley said .
BP 's exploration plan for Lease 206 , which calls the prospect of an oil spill ` ` unlikely , '' stated that ` ` no mitigation measures other than those required by regulation and BP policy will be employed to avoid , diminish or eliminate potential impacts on environmental resources . ''
While the plan included a 13 - page environmental impact analysis , it minimized the prospect of any serious damage associated with a spill , saying there would be only ` ` sub - lethal '' effects on fish and marine mammals , and ` ` birds could become oiled .
However it is unlikely that an accidental oil spill would occur from the proposed activities . ''
Kiern Suckling , executive director of the environmental group Center for Biological Diversity , said the federal waiver ` ` put BP entirely in control '' of the way it conducted its drilling .
` ` The agency 's oversight role has devolved to little more than rubber - stamping British Petroleum 's self - serving drilling plans , '' Suckling said .
BP has lobbied the White House Council on Environmental Quality -- which provides NEPA guidance for all federal agencies -- to provide categorical exemptions more often .
In an <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2010-04-09">April 9</TIMEX3> letter , BP America 's senior federal affairs director , Margaret D. Laney , wrote to the council that such exemptions should be used in situations where environmental damage is likely to be ` ` minimal or non - existent . ''
An expansion in these waivers would help ` ` avoid unnecessary paperwork and time delays , '' she added .
Lawmakers on Capitol Hill were talking <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2010-05-04">Tuesday</TIMEX3> about curtailing offshore oil exploration rather than making it easier .

In addition to traditional foes of offshore drilling such as Democratic Sens . Robert Menendez -LRB- N.J. -RRB- and Bill Nelson -LRB- Fla.
-RRB- , Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid -LRB- D - Nev .
-RRB- and centrists such as Max Baucus -LRB- D - Mont .
-RRB- and Richard G. Lugar -LRB- R - Ind .
-RRB- said they are taking a second look at such methods .
` ` It 's time to push the pause button , '' Baucus told reporters .
