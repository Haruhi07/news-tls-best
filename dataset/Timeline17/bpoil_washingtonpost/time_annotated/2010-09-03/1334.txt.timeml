The ` ` blowout preventer '' from BP 's Macondo well - which infamously failed to prevent <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-SU">this summer</TIMEX3> 's spill - has begun its transition from sub - sea equipment to federal evidence .
The 450 - ton device was removed <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="TIME" value="2010-09-03TAF">Friday afternoon</TIMEX3> from the Gulf of Mexico floor and attached to a long section of pipe that will be used to haul it 5,000 feet to the surface , according to a statement from retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad W. Allen , the federal government 's point man on the BP oil spill .
Allen said it would take <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="P1D">24</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="PT36H">36 hours</TIMEX3> for the device to reach a rig called the Q4000 .
The removal of the blowout preventer had been delayed because of high waves in the gulf , which would have put extra strain on the pipe ; it was carrying about 1 million pounds .
When it is brought to shore , the device will undergo the mechanical equivalent of an autopsy .
Federal investigators will take the blowout preventer apart as they try to determine why it failed to shut off the well after the explosion at the Deepwater Horizon rig <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> .
If the device was poorly maintained - or altered in a way that made it less effective - that could contribute to a finding of ` ` criminal negligence '' against BP or one of the contractors working on the rig .
The investigation could also find that improperly attached pipes shot up into the device during the blowout , jamming it open .
The BP well has not leaked oil since <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2010-07-15">July 15</TIMEX3> , when remote - controlled submarines sealed shut a mechanical ` ` cap '' that had been installed on top of the blowout preventer .
The well was then filled with cement from the top .
Because of that , officials said , both the blowout preventer and the cap could be removed without more oil leaking .
<TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> , federal officials said , they plan to install a new blowout preventer .
They also plan to proceed with the long - awaited ` ` bottom kill '' <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2010-W36">next week</TIMEX3> , sealing off the well thousands of feet below the sea floor .
Also <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2010-09-03">Friday</TIMEX3> , the federal government reopened 3,114 square miles off the Florida panhandle to fishing , following seafood testing , officials said .
Seventeen 17 percent of U.S. gulf waters remain closed , down from 37 percent during the height of the spill .
BP said it has spent $ 8 billion on the spill , including the costs of cleaning up the oil , capping the well and paying compensation claims .
It has also set aside $ 20 billion for claims in an escrow account , under the supervision of Washington lawyer Kenneth Feinberg .
And the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management , Regulation and Enforcement - the successor to the beleaguered Minerals Management Service - said it was launching an investigation into a fire at another offshore facility <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2010-09-02">Thursday</TIMEX3> .
The fire , at Mariner Energy 's Vermilion 380 production platform , caused 13 crew members to jump overboard .
Federal officials did not release details <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2010-09-03">Friday</TIMEX3> about the cause .
All of the crew members were rescued unhurt , and there was no significant oil spill from the damaged platform .
A Coast Guard overflight <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2010-09-03">Friday</TIMEX3> noted only a ` ` light rainbow sheen '' on the water , believed to be oily residue washed overboard during fire - fighting . ''
