Explore all of our oil spill graphics to track the spill , see its effects , and learn its possible solutions .
The White House ordered BP to pay for construction of five more large sections of Louisiana barrier island sand berms <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2010-06-02">Wednesday</TIMEX3> as efforts to contain the gushing Deepwater Horizon oil spill hit more obstacles and the slick approached Florida .
BP announced <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-06-02" mod="END">later Wednesday</TIMEX3> that it supports the administration 's decision , and that the project will cost the company an estimated $ 360 million .
That is double the amount it has spent so far in helping the region respond to the oil spill .
` ` The federal government and the state of Louisiana have agreed that the barrier islands construction is an effective response to the spill , and we look forward to working with them on this project , '' said Tony Hayward , BP 's chief executive officer .
` ` There is no time for waiting , '' said
Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal -LRB- R -RRB- after learning that the plan would go ahead .
` ` We are asking the Coast Guard and the federal government to force BP to act responsibly and immediately get to work on all the six segments that have <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> been approved as part of our oil spill - fighting efforts . ''
The costly construction has been a high priority for Louisiana officials , but federal officials have worried about unintended environmental consequences , and BP has been less than eager to pay -- calling the buildup a ` ` hurricane relief project . ''
The Army Corps of Engineers issued six permits in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-05" mod="END">late May</TIMEX3> to build up about 50 of the 100 miles of barrier islands requested by Louisiana .
Although the projects have received expedited environmental approval , the administration also needed to determine whether the work would actually stop oil from entering the marshlands , and to persuade BP to pay for it .
Out in the Gulf of Mexico , BP has given up trying to stop the leak permanently until relief wells <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> being drilled reach it in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-08">August</TIMEX3> , and continued to struggle to contain it .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-06-02">Wednesday</TIMEX3> , a diamond - tipped saw being used to cut a broken riser pipe and prepare it for a containment ` ` hat '' got stuck , and the cut could n't be completed .
Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen , the government 's point man for the crisis , said the amount of oil contained by the stopgap covering will be determined to some extent by how fine a cut is made .
Federal ocean specialists launched a research vessel <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2010-06-02">Wednesday</TIMEX3> to determine whether large plumes of oil are floating beneath the surface , as some researchers have claimed and which BP has denied .
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ship Thomas Jefferson will travel around the gulf for <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="P10D">10 days</TIMEX3> to search for underwater oil .
Tar balls and oil sheen from the huge slick reached Alabama 's Dauphin Island on <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2010-06-02">Wednesday</TIMEX3> , as well as parts of Mississippi .
The oil was also spotted less than 10 miles from the Florida Panhandle , further threatening the region 's vital seafood and tourism industries .
The issue of how offshore oil projects should be reviewed was addressed <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2010-06-02">Wednesday</TIMEX3> by the Interior Department .
The Washington Post reported <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2010-06-02">Wednesday</TIMEX3> that the department 's Minerals Management Service gave ` ` categorical exclusions '' from environmental review to eight offshore operations , including the Deepwater Horizon .
Bob Abbey , the agency 's acting director , announced that ` ` before drilling new oil and gas wells on the Outer Continental Shelf , operators will be required to submit additional information about potential risks and safety considerations in their plans for exploration or development . ''
He said exploration and development plans previously approved by the agency using ` ` categorical exclusions '' would have to be resubmitted .
