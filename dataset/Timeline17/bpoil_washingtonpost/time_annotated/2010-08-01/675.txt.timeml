While the BP well was still gushing , the Obama administration issued an order that limited the spreading of controversial dispersant chemicals on the Gulf of Mexico 's surface .
Their use , officials said , should be restricted to ` ` rare cases . ''
But in reality , federal documents show , the use of dispersants was n't rare at all .
Despite the order -- and concerns about the environmental effects of the dispersants -- the Coast Guard granted requests to use them 74 times <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P54D" mod="MORE_THAN">over 54 days</TIMEX3> , and to use them on the surface and deep underwater at the well site .
The Coast Guard approved every request submitted by BP or local Coast Guard commanders in Houma , La. , although in some cases it reduced the amount of the chemicals they could use , according to an analysis of the documents prepared by the office of Rep. Edward J. Markey -LRB-
D - Mass .
-RRB- .
The documents indicate that ` ` these exemptions are in no way a ` rare ' occurrence , and have allowed surface application of the dispersant to occur virtually <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EVERY">every day</TIMEX3> since the directive was issued , '' Markey wrote in a letter dated <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-08-01">Aug. 1</TIMEX3> to retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad W. Allen , the government 's point man on the spill .
Markey chairs the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming .
Some of them dealt with separate dispersant applications on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-08-01">the same day</TIMEX3> .
Markey said it appeared that the order ` ` has become more of a meaningless paperwork exercise '' than a real attempt to curb use of the dispersants .
In an interview <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-07-31">Saturday</TIMEX3> , Allen defended the decisions to grant the waivers , saying that overall use of dispersants declined sharply after that <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-05-26">May 26</TIMEX3> order to limit their use .
The total use of dispersants underwater and on the surface declined about 72 percent from its peak , according to the Environmental Protection Agency .
Allen said that on <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="PXD">some days</TIMEX3> the amount of oil on the surface justified a ` ` tactical '' decision , by on - scene Coast Guard commanders , to spray some dispersants .
` ` There 's a dynamic tension that goes on when you 're managing an incident that has no precedent , '' Allen said .
` ` You establish general rules and guidelines , but knowing that the people on scene have the information '' means trusting them to make decisions , he said .
In the end , Allen said : ` ` You can quibble on the semantics related to ` rare . '
I like to focus on the effects we achieved '' by dispersing the oil .
Officials have said that , in the days since the gusher was stopped , thick sheets of oil have nearly disappeared from the gulf 's surface .
EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson conceded that there had been ` ` frustration in the field '' from EPA officials about the waivers .
But Jackson said it was partly alleviated <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2010-06-22">June 22</TIMEX3> , <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="P1M" mod="LESS_THAN">nearly a month</TIMEX3> after the order was issued , when Coast Guard officials began giving the EPA a greater role in the discussions over whether to approve dispersant use .
` ` EPA may not have concurred with every single waiver , '' Jackson said .
But , she said , the Coast Guard had the ultimate say : ` ` The final decision - making rests with the federal on - scene coordinator .
That 's where the judgment , the ultimate decision - making ability , had to lie . ''
The dispersants -- variants of a Nalco product called Corexit -- break up the oil , acting like a detergent on kitchen grease .
They are intended to keep the oil from reaching shore in large sheets and to make it easier for microbes to consume the oil underwater .
