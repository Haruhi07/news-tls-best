BP 's chief executive Tony Hayward met with Abu Dhabi 's crown prince <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2010-07-07">Wednesday</TIMEX3> while BP 's investment bankers worked to raise money without shedding any of the company 's crown jewels .
Hayward is looking to shore up BP 's standing with foreign partners , investors and host countries .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> visits to Russia and Azerbaijan , he reaffirmed the company 's commitment to exploration projects there , and he told reporters in the United Arab Emirates <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-07-07">Wednesday</TIMEX3> that he had a ` ` very good '' meeting with the crown prince , Sheik Mohammed bin Zayed al - Nahyan .
Hayward heads next to Angola , where BP has deep - water offshore exploration and production projects .
Meanwhile , the company is also looking to shore up its finances , pressing ahead with plans to raise $ 7 billion to $ 10 billion by selling ` ` non - core '' assets over <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011">the next year</TIMEX3> .
Industry sources familiar with the negotiations said <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-W27">this week</TIMEX3> that investors -- including U.S. and European oil firms , BP 's Russian partners , and one of China 's state oil companies -- have been approached about buying BP oil and gas production assets in countries including Argentina , Venezuela , Vietnam , Indonesia and Algeria .
BP also may look to sell some of its 35 percent interest in Alaska 's aging Prudhoe Bay field , some sources said , though others said the company would not want to do anything to raise fears that it is reducing its U.S. exposure .
The sources spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks are private .
Brian Youngberg , an oil analyst with Edward Jones , said that BP has sold an average of $ 2.5 billion <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> of assets <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="P3Y" mod="MORE_THAN">over the past three years</TIMEX3> as part of the normal repositioning strategy .
` ` Companies routinely buy and sell assets , '' he said .
` ` This would be just a bit more than normal . ''
` ` BP will have no trouble selling these assets , '' said Fadel Gheit , an oil analyst with Oppenheimer & Co. .
China , which is expanding oil holdings worldwide , might want reserves in Venezuela or Asia .
Gheit also said that Exxon Mobil might use the opportunity to try to buy minority positions in some of BP 's extensive holdings off the coast of West Africa .
BP 's assets in Argentina may be the most likely to go .
When it bought Amoco , BP acquired 60 percent of a venture that has boosted output from an aging field , which <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> produces 100,000 barrels <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> of oil and 450 million cubic feet <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> of natural gas .
Gheit said other oil companies with fields in Argentina might be able to operate BP 's fields profitably because of economies of scale .
BP denied reports that it was looking for a sovereign wealth fund to take a big equity stake in the company , much as Middle East investors propped up the shares of beleaguered U.S. financial firms by taking substantial minority stakes .
But BP spokesman Andrew Gowers said that ` ` we are talking to investors about the attractions of coming into BP at <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> attractive prices . ''
He said Hayward 's message was ` ` we welcome new shareholders on our register or existing shareholders who see an opportunity to top up . ''
Abu Dhabi 's crown prince is also head of the emirate 's sovereign wealth fund .
Sovereign funds are already big BP shareholders .
They include the government of Norway , which reported on <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2010-05-01">May 1</TIMEX3> that it bought a 1.7 percent stake ; the People 's Bank of China with 1.1 percent ; the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation with 1.07 percent ; and the Kuwait Investment Authority with 1.75 percent .
In a strong day for stock markets , BP jumped $ 1.28 a share , or 4 percent , to $ 33.19 a share on the New York Stock Exchange .
But uncertainty remains over the upper limit of BP 's legal liabilities .
Sanford C. Bernstein investment analysts said <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2010-W27">this week</TIMEX3> that the oil spill disaster could cost the company $ 33 billion . ''
