BEIJING -- Hundreds of firefighters and civilian volunteers used bare hands , chopsticks and plastic garbage bags <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2010-07-22">Thursday</TIMEX3> to wage a low - tech battle against a giant oil slick spreading off China 's northeastern coast .
The slick , near the oil port of Dalian , in Liaoning province , was caused when two pipelines exploded <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-07-16">last Friday</TIMEX3> as crude was being unloaded from a Libyan tanker .
Government officials said the accident released about 1,500 tons -- or 400,000 gallons -- of oil into the Yellow Sea , where the slick <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> covers up to 170 square miles , according to news reports , making it China 's largest recorded spill .
The BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is estimated in the tens of millions of gallons .
` ` I used small wood planks to scoop up the oil and put it into big plastic garbage bags , '' said Liu Jia , a worker at the Dalian beach resort .
` ` Some of my colleagues used chopsticks ...
It works , because the oil is quite sticky .
Sometimes , we just used our hands to pick up the sand that is covered with oil . ''
Liu described the methods being used as ` ` quite primitive , quite time - consuming . ''
China National Petroleum Corp. said <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-07-22">Thursday</TIMEX3> that no more oil was leaking from the damaged pipelines , but the port at Dalian remained closed as the black oil continued to wash up onshore .
Fishing has been banned in the vicinity at least through <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2009-08">August</TIMEX3> , and several nearby beaches were also declared off - limits at the height of <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-SU">the summer</TIMEX3> tourist season .
` ` It should be the best season for the beach <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3> , '' said Bao Wulan , head of public relations for the Dalian Golden Beach Tourism Group .
She said that 70,000 to 80,000 visitors would normally be in the area this time of year -- ` ` but <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> , no tourists . ''
She added : ` ` I do n't know how our business can go back to normal .
Our beach is almost all polluted . ''
The environmental group Greenpeace China said it has found oil in bays six miles from Dalian , and Jinshitan Golden Beach , more than 20 miles away , was also reportedly affected .
Workers were laying straw mats at Jinshitan on <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-07-22">Thursday</TIMEX3> in a bid to suck up the crude .
Greenpeace said 10,000 shellfish farms have been contaminated .
The battle against the spreading oil slick has claimed the life of one worker , a firefighter who drowned <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2010-07-20">Tuesday</TIMEX3> .
Although hundreds of civilian volunteers have been mobilized to help with the cleanup , the lack of equipment has hindered the ad hoc effort .
