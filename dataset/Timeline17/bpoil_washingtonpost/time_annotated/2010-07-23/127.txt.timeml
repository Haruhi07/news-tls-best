-- Long before an eruption of gas turned the Deepwater Horizon oil rig into a fireball , an alarm system designed to automatically alert the crew and prevent combustible gases from reaching potential sources of ignition had been deliberately disabled , the former chief electronics technician on the rig testified <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-07-23">Friday</TIMEX3> .
Michael Williams , a former Marine who survived the <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> inferno by jumping from the burning rig , told a federal panel probing the disaster that other critical systems had been functioning unreliably in the run - up to the blowout .
Williams told the panel that he understood that the rig had been operating with the gas alarm system in ` ` inhibited '' mode for <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> to prevent false alarms from disturbing the crew .
Williams said that when he discovered that the alarm system was inhibited , he reported it to supervisors .
He said they informed him that orders were to keep it that way .
If the safety system was disabled , it would not have been unusual .
Records of federal enforcement actions reviewed by The Washington Post show that , in case after case , rig operators paid fines for allegedly bypassing safety systems that could impede routine operations .
The Deepwater Horizon was owned by Transocean , which employs Williams , and was operating under contract to BP .
Transocean said in a statement that the rig 's general alarm system was controlled by a person on the bridge ` ` to prevent the general alarm from sounding unnecessarily . ''
Transocean provided statements taken from crew members saying they heard alarms , and it also released part of an <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2010-04">April</TIMEX3> inspection report that found ` ` no -LRB- gas -RRB- detectors either in fault or inhibited condition , other than units being serviced . ''
Williams testified that a computer used to monitor and control drilling operations intermittently froze -- a problem that became known as ` ` the blue screen of death . ''
Despite attempted repairs , the issue remained unresolved at the time of the blowout , he said .
Earlier in the drilling operation , one of the panels that controlled the blowout preventer -- the last line of defense against a gusher -- had been placed in bypass mode to work around a malfunction , Williams said .
He said a colleague told him that an inspection of the rig in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2010-SP">the spring</TIMEX3> , shortly before the disaster , found extensive maintenance problems .
The colleague said ` ` that we were going to be in the shipyard a lot longer than anticipated because the rig was in very bad condition , '' Williams testified .
The Coast Guard and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management , Regulation and Enforcement , until <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> called the Minerals Management Service , are conducting the hearing .
Testimony continued before the panel <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2010-07-23">Friday</TIMEX3> even as the leftovers of Tropical Storm Bonnie blew toward the spill site .
Forecasters predicted that the storm , which had lessened to a tropical depression , would gain strength before it was over the site about midday <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2010-07-17">Saturday</TIMEX3> .
Retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen said two control ships monitoring the newly capped well would try to ride out the storm .
All other vessels connected to the spill effort have headed for shelter .
