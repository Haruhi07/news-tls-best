A new piece of equipment designed to control the gushing Gulf of Mexico oil well sprung its own leak <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="TIME" value="2010-07-14TNI">Wednesday night</TIMEX3> , the latest setback to BP 's efforts to put an end to the environmental disaster .
BP said that the leak in what is known as the choke line could be repaired and that its effort to close the damaged well , and shut down the flow of oil permanently , would resume .
But video streams from the seafloor showed a chaotic plume of oil and gas continuing to surge from one of the outlets on the 75 - ton cap installed <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-W28" mod="START">earlier this week</TIMEX3> .
It was unclear <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010-07-14" mod="END">late Wednesday</TIMEX3> whether the leak would be a momentary hitch in the much - anticipated ` ` integrity test '' on the well , or if it would put the operation in grave peril .

But the plumbing failure showed once again that nothing has come easy in the long campaign to kill the Macondo well , which blew out <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> and destroyed the Deepwater Horizon rig , killing 11 workers .
Federal officials green - lighted the test after a 24 - hour delay , during which government scientists and outside experts demanded more information from BP about possible hazards posed by stopping the flow of the well .
They are concerned that a spike in pressure as the flow is clamped could blow oil and gas out of the casing of the well and into the geological formations .
Throughout the crisis , engineers have feared the possibility that efforts to fix the problem could make it worse .
Such concerns ultimately did not dissuade authorities from going forward with what could be a high - reward maneuver .
Retired Coast Guard Adm.
Thad W. Allen , the national incident commander , said that , notwithstanding the concerns of scientists , he is ` ` gung ho '' about the test .
` ` It will be terrific news if we can shut in the well , '' Allen said , adding , however , ` ` I do n't want to get anyone 's hopes up . ''
Once BP engineers closed the main chimney on the new ` ` capping stack '' installed atop the well <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="TIME" value="2010-07-12TNI">Monday night</TIMEX3> , that left oil and gas surging from two other ports .
The protocol developed by BP and approved by federal authorities called for quickly closing one , known as the kill line , then very gradually reducing the flow from the choke line until the well flows no more .
The company said <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="TIME" value="2010-07-14TNI">Wednesday night</TIMEX3> in a statement that the leak in the choke line ` ` has been isolated and will be repaired prior to starting the test . ''
Federal officials and BP engineers are anxiously observing what happens to pressures in the well .
A steady increase in pressure as the flow is reduced would be a strong sign that the Macondo well , drilled by the <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> - sunken rig Deepwater Horizon , is physically intact , and that oil and gas are not leaking into the surrounding mud and rock formations below the gulf floor .
Robotic submersibles are scrutinizing the muddy gulf floor and the base of the blowout preventer for signs of oil or gas rising from below .
Scientists are also using seismic and sonar instruments to monitor any possible movement of hydrocarbons in the rock formations surrounding the well .
