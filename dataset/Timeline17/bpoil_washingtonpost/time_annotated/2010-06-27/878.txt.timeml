NEW ORLEANS --
They came here seeking refuge , but <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DURATION" value="PXY">the past few years</TIMEX3> have brought unexpected hardship to the tightly knit Vietnamese fishing community .
They arrived after the fall of Saigon in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="1975">1975</TIMEX3> , lured by the city 's tropical climate and strong Catholic heritage .
Shrimping and fishing in the Gulf Coast 's bountiful bayous was one of the few familiar touchstones for these mostly unskilled laborers with little English .
An estimated 20,000 Vietnamese fishermen and shrimpers live along the Gulf Coast -- about half of the total fishing community -- and many more work at the seafood processing plants , wholesalers and po - boy shops found at every traffic light .
<TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> the sanctuary they found and the lives they built -- and rebuilt after Hurricane Katrina -- are threatened by the hemorrhaging oil in the Gulf of Mexico .
Many Vietnamese worry they will not have the energy to start over yet again .
` ` When I came to Louisiana , this was how people here made a living .
I had to follow , '' 50 - year - old shrimper Dung Nguyen says in Vietnamese .
` ` I do n't know how I ' m going to live . ''
Nguyen says he has no idea whether life is harder for him than for American shrimpers ; he does n't know any to ask .
All he knows is that his wife , their five daughters , his mother - in - law and his granddaughter -- all of whom live with him in a modest rented home in the industrial eastern edge of New Orleans -- are counting on him for survival .
That 's why he got up before dawn <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-W24">last week</TIMEX3> to stand in line for a food voucher with dozens of other out - of - work Vietnamese fishermen and shrimpers in the concrete alley in front of Mary Queen of Vietnam Catholic Church 's community office .
The wait can last five , six , even <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="PT7H">seven hours</TIMEX3> .
Oversleepers are turned away before they even make it inside .
` ` If you 're a little bit late ... , ''
Nguyen warns in Vietnamese , shaking his head .
He knows because he showed up after <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="TIME" value="XXXX-XX-XXT05:00">5 a.m.</TIMEX3> for <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P2D">two days</TIMEX3> and missed out on a $ 100 grocery store gift certificate , 20 of which are handed out every morning .
It is <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="TIME" value="XXXX-XX-XXT08:30">8:30 a.m.</TIMEX3> and the office has yet to open , but he is hoping the third time is the charm .
Besides , he says , he has nothing to do all day but sit around and think -- about having no work , no money and no options .
Normally Nguyen is on a boat this time of year , coming ashore for a home visit about <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="SET" value="P1M" freq="1">once a month</TIMEX3> .
His wife , Ut , makes shrimp nets , and his oldest daughter , Lisa , 20 , fixes trawls and cleans boats .
<TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> they are all unemployed .
` ` Get in a straight line , please , '' a woman calls out in English to the group , mostly men , milling about the alley as staffers open the office door .
The Vietnamese quickly flatten themselves along the wall as aid workers hand out numbered tickets for vouchers to the first in line .
Dung secures one , as does his wife , even though the vouchers are technically limited to one per family .
Because so many Vietnamese share the same last name and the community is so intertwined , the rule is tough to enforce .
