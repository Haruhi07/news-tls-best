Storms in the Caribbean are the latest threat to the frustratingly slow effort to contain and clean up the massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
Meteorologists say Tropical Storm Alex , which is brewing in the western Caribbean , is not on pace to hit the oil well , but it has prompted the team overseeing the spill site to heighten emergency planning .
If a storm with gale - force winds comes within <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DURATION" value="P5D">five days</TIMEX3> of reaching the gushing oil well , crews would begin packing up to return to shore , said Coast Guard Adm.
Thad W. Allen , who is overseeing the crisis for the government .
A full evacuation could stop containment activities for <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P2W">two weeks</TIMEX3> .
` ` We are watching the storm track , and if we think it is turned in such a way that it would cross the site , we would activate the plans , '' Allen said <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-06-26">Saturday</TIMEX3> on a call with reporters .
` ` We are engaged constantly with the National Hurricane Center ...
We all know that the weather is unpredictable . ''
Allen and his team might be forced to make tough and consequential predictions anyway .
More than 30,000 people and 6,000 ships are working on the spill , and they will need <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="PXD">several days</TIMEX3> ' warning to get out of a storm 's way .
If a storm pops up in the gulf suddenly , people can be evacuated in a tighter time frame , but those contingency plans risk damaging key equipment .
` ` The safety of life is the number one priority , '' Allen said .
BP is working to shorten the time needed to secure or move all of its equipment from <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P5D">five days</TIMEX3> to two , company spokesman Bill Salvin told the Associated Press .
The equipment includes the ships processing the oil sucked up by the containment cap on the well and the rigs drilling the two relief wells .
A full evacuation would force BP to disconnect the ships from the containment cap <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> funneling half or more of the leaking oil to tankers waiting above the well a mile below the surface .
Allen said the workers would return to shore , wait out the storm and then reconnect the complicated equipment .
BP is working to develop a containment system that would be easier to disconnect and hook back up .
The construction of the two relief wells , projected to be done by mid - <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2009-08">August</TIMEX3> , would also be impeded by stormy weather .
Those relief wells are the best hope of halting the oil that has been gushing into gulf waters since <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> in the biggest offshore oil spill in U.S. history .
BP is capturing 20,000 to 28,500 barrels -LRB- 840,000 to 1.2 million gallons -RRB- of oil <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> .
Worst - case government estimates say 59,500 barrels -LRB- 2.5 million gallons -RRB- <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> are leaking from the well , although that number is a rough approximation .
Alex , which was rated a tropical storm <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2010-06-26" mod="START">early Saturday</TIMEX3> , is the first of many expected this hurricane season .
It was headed to the Yucatan Peninsula at 9 mph with winds of 45 mph , according to the hurricane center . ''
