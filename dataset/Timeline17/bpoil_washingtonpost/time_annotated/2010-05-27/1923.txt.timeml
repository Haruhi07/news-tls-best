ON BARATARIA BAY , LA . --
In the Louisiana marsh , oil - coated pelicans flap their wings in a futile attempt to dry them .
A shorebird repeatedly dunks its face in a puddle , unable to wash off .
Lines of dead jellyfish float in the gulf , traces of oil visible in their clear ` ` bells . ''
These scenes , scientists say , are confirmation of what they had feared for <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P1M">a month</TIMEX3> .
<TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> that oil from the Gulf of Mexico 's vast spill has come ashore -- in some places , as thick as soft fudge -- it is causing serious damage in one of the country 's great natural nurseries .
In nature , oil is a versatile killer .
It smothers the tiny animals that make up a coral reef .
It suffocates blades of marsh grass , cutting them off from air and sunlight .
It clumps up a bird 's feathers , leaving it unable to fly ; then , trying to remove the oil , birds swallow it .
For <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> , scientists are seeing the worst effects only in one corner of the Louisiana coast .
But they 're concerned about what they 're not seeing -- and worried that the impact on animals and plants will only get worse .
` ` <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> that the stuff is really sort of coming ashore , it really is living up to its potential .
It 's certainly breached the sort of outer defense system of Louisiana , '' said James H. Cowan Jr. , a professor at Louisiana State University .
` ` It 's the very worst - case scenario for things like birds and mammals . ''
On <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010-05-26">Wednesday</TIMEX3> , the oil company BP started a ` ` top kill '' of its leaking well , 5,000 feet below the surface and more than 40 miles off Louisiana .
The procedure involves shooting high - pressure mud into the well , hoping the mud coming in will eventually overwhelm the oil shooting out .
But even if that works , it will do nothing to rein in the oil that has escaped .
That oil began washing up in Louisiana <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-W20">last week</TIMEX3> , <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P1M" mod="APPROX">about a month</TIMEX3> after the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded and sank .
It first appeared in the remote marshes near the Mississippi River 's mouth .
Then , <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2010-W21">this week</TIMEX3> , it began washing into the vast complex of islands , lakes and bayous just west of the river .
` ` Unfortunately , it 's looking like a real oil spill <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> , '' said Larry McKinney , who heads the Harte Research Institute for Gulf of Mexico Studies , part of Texas A&M University .
` ` This is the stuff that does the damage . ''
On <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="TIME" value="2010-05-25TMO">Tuesday morning</TIMEX3> , Louisiana scientists ventured out here into Barataria Bay , looking for oil and oil - covered animals .
Near Isle Grande Terre , a brown pelican -- the state bird -- sat atop a piling , its chest and head feathers matted down with oil .
As the boat approached , it flew away .
But within seconds , the pelican alighted on a nearby rock .
It was already too weak to fly long distances .
