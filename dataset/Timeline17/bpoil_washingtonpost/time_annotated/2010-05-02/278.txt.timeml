Oil execs in Senate hearing as gulf oil spill cleanup efforts continue -- photos Oil companies stress one another 's failures in a Senate hearing as cleanup and containment efforts continue in the Gulf of Mexico , after the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> .

--
In this Gulf Coast fishing town , they spent <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-05-01">Saturday</TIMEX3> awaiting , and dreading , the oil .
The slick from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill was still too far offshore to see or even smell .
At least , it did n't smell worse than the harbor 's usual mix of boat fuel and bait .
But there were rumors : It would come <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-05-02">Sunday</TIMEX3> , first the sheen and then the thick stuff behind it .
People here had heard that just to the west , fishermen were already pulling up shrimp that smelled like diesel fuel .
On the Royster , a rust - edged fishing boat , Richard Bosarge said that he feared the oil could coat the valuable oyster grounds , which the fishermen here know so intimately they have given them names like ` ` Square Handkerchief '' and ` ` Pass Mary Anne . ''
And the oil could poison the huge stocks of shrimp offshore .
` ` They 're out of reach until he 's probably my age , '' Bosarge , 42 , said , pointing to his son Roy , who is 15 .
` ` Just take a picture and put it in a museum . ''
It has been <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P11D">11 days</TIMEX3> since a BP oil and gas exploration well blew out , setting fire to the drilling rig , which sank , killing 11 people .
Ever since , crude oil has been leaking into the Gulf of Mexico , raising the prospects of a historic environmental disaster .
Winds from the southeast have nudged the slick northward , where it floated <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-05-01">Saturday</TIMEX3> near the coasts of Louisiana , Alabama and Mississippi as residents waited anxiously for it to arrive .
` ` Mother Nature gets a vote in this thing , and that 's probably the most unpredictable thing we ' ve got , '' said Adm. Thad Allen , commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard .
` ` There 's enough oil out there to impact the shoreline .
The real question is when and where . ''
President Obama plans to visit the area <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="TIME" value="2010-05-02TMO">Sunday morning</TIMEX3> to see any environmental damage for himself and check on the federal response .
With the economy already weak , the widening oil slick could add to the region 's woes by damaging the fishing , tourism and shipping industries .
The White House is eager to avoid the mistakes made by President George W. Bush , who was seen as too detached from floundering rescue efforts after the much more dire Hurricane Katrina .
And that is the problem for Obama <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3> : Things are not going well in the battle to contain the oil spill .
Allen , who Obama has named ` ` national incident commander '' for the spill , said <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2010-05-01">Saturday</TIMEX3> that no progress had been made in cutting off the flow of oil from the damaged well , which is 5,000 feet below the ocean surface .
Allen said weather and choppy seas were hindering efforts to contain the spill by laying out booms or skimming oil off the water , control techniques that have changed little <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="P4DE" mod="MORE_THAN">over the past four decades</TIMEX3> .
Allen said BP has not yet started drilling a relief well to cut off and plug the leaking one , and he reiterated that the new well would take weeks to complete .
That poses political as well as environmental and economic challenges .
Obama faces the politically tricky task of appearing in control of the response while avoiding the blame for the situation .
While he repeatedly refers to BP as ` ` the responsible party '' under legislation approved in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="1990">1990</TIMEX3> , administration officials have also been striving to demonstrate their attention to the crisis .
