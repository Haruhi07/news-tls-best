In a complicated subsea dance involving robots and hardware , BP made progress <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2010-07-11">Sunday</TIMEX3> in its effort to install a new , secure cap on the gushing oil well at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico , but the company says that it is early in the week - long project and that the oil is spewing as skimmers try to capture the newly vigorous flow of crude .
BP engineers are hopeful that by week 's end they will have placed a perfect seal over the well , which began bleeding oil into the gulf <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> after an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig , in which 11 workers died .
` ` We did an extensive amount of preparation work in terms of planning and installation , and we 're pleased at this point on how it 's going , '' said Kent Wells , a BP senior vice president , referring to the removal <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="TIME" value="2010-07-11TMO" mod="START">early Sunday morning</TIMEX3> of the top flange on the leaking well and the installation of a device that will eventually connect the new cap to the well .
Wells said the maneuvers , which are being conducted in large part by robotic submarines a mile under the water 's surface , are going smoothly partly because of a window of good weather and calm seas .
Separately , the <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-07-11">Sunday</TIMEX3> Times of London reported that BP is in talks to sell about $ 10 billion in assets , including a share of its Alaska oil production , to Apache , a large U.S. independent oil company .

A sale that size would cover about half the amount of money BP has promised to put in an escrow fund to cover claims related to the spill .
BP owns 26 percent of the Prudhoe Bay field , the biggest in the United States , and five other fields on Alaska 's North Slope .

But the field is past its prime .
More than half the oil has been produced from the Prudhoe Bay field ; production , a fraction of its peak , is dropping about 10 percent <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> , BP has said .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2010-07-10">Saturday</TIMEX3> , robots removed the cap that had been placed on top of the leak in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2010-06" mod="START">early June</TIMEX3> to collect the oil and send it to surface ships for collection or burning .
That move allows the well to spew oil in an uncontrolled manner until the new cap is installed .
BP said a containment ship , the Helix Producer , steamed into place over the well and was expected to begin collecting oil <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="TIME" value="2010-07-11TNI">Sunday night</TIMEX3> or <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2010-07-12" mod="START">early Monday</TIMEX3> .
Federal officials say the well is releasing as much as 2.5 million gallons of oil <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> .
The old cap collected about 1 million gallons , according to the government .
BP officials say that once the new cap and a new containment vessel are in place , the system will be capable of capturing 2.5 million to 3.4 million gallons daily .
Still , it would be a temporary fix ; BP hopes to plug the leak permanently by mid - <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2010-08">August</TIMEX3> .
Meanwhile , the Justice Department has started interviewing witnesses as part of the criminal and civil probe of the spill . ''
