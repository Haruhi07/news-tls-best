Possible oil - spill solutions pour in , seemingly unheeded , from around the world A constituent of Sen. Mike Enzi 's makes a product from beetle - killed pine trees that soaks up oil like crazy , but the man ca n't get BP to listen to his ideas .
What 's happened to his suggestions ?
` ` They ' ve been lost , '' the Wyoming Republican complained at a hearing <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2010-W24">two weeks ago</TIMEX3> .
The pine tree product was one of about 120,000 ideas BP says it has received in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent weeks</TIMEX3> .
Its proponent is one of many to express frustration by the company 's apparent lack of response .
John Rexholm , a 57 - year - old Swedish naval architect living in Germany , has an idea for hooding the blown - out Gulf well and directing the oil up to the surface .
He sent it to BP .
<TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P1M">A month</TIMEX3> later , he got three e - mail replies in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> : One asked for more information , another said a similar idea was being considered and a third advised that ` ` your idea can not be applied under the very challenging ... conditions we face . ''
Donald LaFond , a 48 - year - old contractor in Sudbury , Ontario , is sure that the device he invented <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2002">eight years ago</TIMEX3> to crack rock without dynamite could seal the Deepwater Horizon well .
He 's spent <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P6W">six weeks</TIMEX3> trying to get someone to listen .
Dwayne Spradlin , head of the Internet - based problem - solving network InnoCentive , put out a call for ideas <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2010-04-30">April 30</TIMEX3> .
About 2,500 people have answered .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2010-06-19">June 19</TIMEX3> , BP said it would not proceed with any of their suggestions because an agreement with InnoCentive would be ` ` too complex and burdensome . ''
` ` Our network is incredibly disenchanted in BP 's lack of interest in outside solutions , '' Spradlin said .
That pretty much summarizes the view of thousands of other people .
Thanks to the crowd - sourcing potential of the Internet , sea - floor - to - Gulf - shore video and the water - torture failure of BP to stop the leak , the Deepwater Horizon disaster has become a personal challenge to numberless scientists , engineers and basement inventors .
As of <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2010-07-02">Friday</TIMEX3> , 119,611 technological suggestions had been sent or routed to BP 's offices in Houston , coming in at a rate of about 4,000 <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> .
The Coast Guard 's Research and Development Center had gotten about 3,000 submittals .
Most from both sources proposed ways to stop the leak or clean up the oil .
BP says it is looking at all ideas , which range from two - sentence e - mails to fully engineered proposals .
They include digital photos of drawings on whiteboards and a crayoned idea from a 9 - year - old boy in Virginia .
` ` The passion is just extraordinary , '' said Michael J. Cortez , a petroleum engineer who manages the Alternative Response Technology team at BP .
But the reality is that nearly all are impossible , impractical , obvious or likely to make things worse .
` ` There are not a lot of novel ideas that we do n't already have a lot of minds thinking of at the same time , '' Cortez said .
