View how tourism , commerce and the coastline are all at risk .
The cord - grass marshes of south Louisiana are nurseries for baby shrimp , stalking grounds for blue crabs , and barriers that slow down waves before they bite off more of the mainland .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2010-04-30">Friday</TIMEX3> , they were becoming defenseless sponges for sticky , dark oil .
The locals said the foul - smelling mass had the goopy look of chocolate mousse .
The scientists said the enormous slick had the potential to bring environmental ruin to this treasured coastline .
The oil is spilling out of the seafloor at 5,000 barrels <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> -- the equivalent of 210,000 gallons -- maybe much more , from a well about 50 miles out in the Gulf of Mexico , and it could soon eclipse the volume of the infamous Exxon Valdez spill in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="1989">1989</TIMEX3> .
That disaster spilled oil onto rocky Alaskan beaches , but it is at least possible to wash oil off a rock .
In the Gulf , the oil is floating into wetlands that could hold on to its toxins for years .
And , scientists said , the spill 's damage could be magnified by its awful timing .
Among the animals that live along the Gulf Coast , this is the time for hatching and rearing : Species as diverse as pelicans , shrimp and alligators are all reproducing , or preparing to .
That could bring sensitive young animals in contact with toxic oil or cause their parents to plunge into oily waters looking for food .
Already , rescuers from Delaware were using Dawn blue dish soap to clean the first bird found to be ` ` oiled '' in the disaster , the Associated Press reported .
The bird , a young northern gannet , had been turned from white to black .
` ` I ca n't imagine we 're not going to have some mass casualties '' among these birds , said Michael Parr of the American Bird Conservancy .
` ` It 's got to be about the worst time <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3> '' for an oil spill to hit .
One environmentalist said the scenario created ` ` a potential mega - disaster . ''
Along the Gulf , they were waiting for it with a dread usually devoted to hurricanes .
` ` The magnitude and the potential for ecological damage is probably more great than anything we ' ve ever seen in the Gulf of Mexico , '' said Nancy Rabalais , a scientist who heads the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium , a research center in Cocodrie , La. ` ` Once it hits the shoreline , it 'll get into everything . ''
The oil has been flowing since <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-04-22">April 22</TIMEX3> , when a drilling rig called the Deepwater Horizon blew up and sank 50 miles out in the Gulf .
By <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010-04-30" mod="END">late Friday</TIMEX3> , federal officials estimated that the slick had reached land in Louisiana 's isolated southeast corner and was being pushed ashore by strong winds .
It had already surrounded some of the Chandeleur Islands off Louisiana , where thousands of brown pelicans are roosting .
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service , which oversees the islands , has protected them with a ring of floating booms .
