In <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-06">June</TIMEX3> , President Obama tapped lawyer Kenneth R. Feinberg , 64 , to oversee the $ 20 billion account funded by BP to compensate victims of the Gulf Coast oil spill , making him the nation 's most famous mediator .
<TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="SET" value="P1W" quant="EVERY">Every week</TIMEX3> , Feinberg leaves his Pennsylvania Avenue office , where the walls are adorned with dozens of pictures and news articles chronicling his work , to spend time with fishermen and others who make their living off the coastal waters .
In a <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> interview with The Washington Post , the Brockton , Mass. , native , who also oversaw the government 's <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-09-11">Sept. 11</TIMEX3> Victim Compensation Fund , talked about the task ahead as he wraps up emergency claim payments and moves on to making final payments to victims .
Excerpts follow : Have you met one - on - one with people who were affected by the spill ?
I ' ve sat down personally with hundreds of people .
I ' ve had town hall meetings throughout the gulf with thousands of people .
You ca n't do this from Washington .
You have to go down there , and that 's what I ' ve been doing .
Why have the claims skyrocketed in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="P2W">the past two weeks</TIMEX3> ?
People are getting paid .
The payments are generous .
People are saying , ` ` Let 's file a claim ; we might get paid too . ''
We do n't know yet how many of them are legitimate .
What problems are you experiencing with processing emergency claims ?
There are 25,000 claims with absolutely no documentation .
Thousands of them say things like , ` ` My neighbor got paid ; pay me too . ''
Or they say , ` ` I fish off the gulf to eat .
Send me grocery money . ''
There are 50,000 of them with woefully inadequate documentation .
What was wrong with the BP claim centers ?
Why did they need to be replaced by your operation ?
The BP claim centers served their purpose .
It was an emergency bandage approach .
Sometimes it went to the right people ; sometime it went to the wrong people .
I know of situations where they paid people who were in desperate straits .
I ' ve seen in many cases BP paid claimants and the payments appear to be fraudulent .
When it comes to final payments , you are counseling people to take the money .
Some are suspicious of whether you are looking out for their best interests , since BP is paying your firm -LRB- Feinberg Rozen LLP -RRB- $ 850,000 <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="P1M">a month</TIMEX3> to run the program .
What do you say ?
