BP gave investors a glimpse of its future <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2010-07-27">Tuesday</TIMEX3> , one that will feature a new American chief executive , slimmed - down operations , and $ 32.2 billion or more in payments to clean up and compensate people affected by the massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
In announcing its second - quarter earnings , the London - based oil giant tried to walk a line between reassuring bankers and investors about its vast assets and financial strength , and avoiding the appearance of being a rich , powerful company insensitive to the plight of the Gulf Coast .
` ` We have much to do to make it right , '' BP Chairman Carl - Henric Svanberg said in a conference call with investment analysts <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-07-27">Tuesday</TIMEX3> , referring to the spill .
But he added that BP 's directors are also ` ` determined to restore value to our shareholders . ''
In mapping out plans to pay for damage and cleanup , BP said it will sell $ 25 billion to $ 30 billion in assets <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P18M" mod="MORE_THAN">over 18 months</TIMEX3> , shedding about 10 percent of its oil and natural gas output .
That should enable it to shrink its outstanding debt and reinstate dividends <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2011">next year</TIMEX3> for shareholders while still covering payments to the massive escrow fund for spill damage claims .
` ` It 's still going to be the second - largest oil and gas producer among international oil companies , '' said Fadel Gheit , oil analyst with Oppenheimer & Co.
` ` Smaller than Exxon Mobil but bigger than Royal Dutch Shell . ''
In a sign of how difficult it will be for BP to turn the page on the crisis , however , Rep. Edward J. Markey -LRB-
D - Mass .
-RRB- lashed out <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-07-27">Tuesday</TIMEX3> at the company for concealing its estimates of the rate at which oil had flowed into the gulf .
Markey released a letter from BP Chief Operating Officer Douglas Suttles to the Coast Guard in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-07" mod="START">early July</TIMEX3> in which Suttles estimated that oil was pouring forth at a rate of 53,000 barrels -LRB- 2.23 million gallons -RRB- <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> .
The BP briefing for investment analysts was a somber one , as Svanberg announced that the board had picked Robert Dudley , a BP managing director and former Amoco executive , to replace chief executive Tony Hayward , a British geologist who had spent his entire career with BP .
Dudley , 54 , who grew up in Mississippi and spent summers boating with his family in the Gulf of Mexico , will become the first foreigner to lead the century - old company .
` ` <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2010-07-28">Today</TIMEX3> is a very sad day for me , '' Hayward said .
` ` I love the company and everything it stands for . ''
He said , however , he realized that for BP ` ` to move forward , particularly in the United States , it should do so under new leadership . ''
Hayward 's compensation package includes a pension valued at about $ 17 million and a severance of $ 1.6 million , or <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> 's salary .
Without costs from the spill , the company would have declared a profit of $ 5.6 billion for <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2010-Q2">the second quarter</TIMEX3> .
Spill charges turned that into a $ 17.2 billion loss .
The appointment of Dudley , who will take charge <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2010-10-01">Oct. 1</TIMEX3> , comes at a turning point in the calamity .
After gushing for <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="P3M">three months</TIMEX3> , the damaged oil well in the Gulf of Mexico has been capped for <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DURATION" value="P12D">the past 12 days</TIMEX3> .
Kenneth Feinberg , the master for the $ 20 billion escrow fund , is taking over the task of scrutinizing and processing claims and proposing settlements .
Still , Dudley 's task will be immense .
Congress is set to raise liability limits for oil spills and to impose tougher regulations on offshore drilling .
Some lawmakers want to prevent BP , the largest producer of oil and gas in the United States , from acquiring new federal leases .
The Justice Department is investigating criminal charges against the company , which could complicate its ability to do business with the federal government or bid for leases .
Asked how BP would be viewed in <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DURATION" value="P5Y">five years</TIMEX3> , Dudley said in ` ` a perfect world '' people would realize that ` ` BP met its commitments to restore the Gulf Coast and as a result of that BP has restored its reputation '' and it would be allowed to grow its U.S. business .
He said , ` ` <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DURATION" value="P5Y">Five years</TIMEX3> from <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> , I hope that people look back and say that was a quite incredible response to a quite tragic accident . ''
Although BP 's provision for claims and cleanup is unprecedented in size , some analysts questioned whether it is big enough .
If found to be ` ` grossly negligent '' in the way it was drilling the Macondo well that exploded on <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> , BP could wind up paying an additional $ 12 billion in fines alone and nearly twice as much overall , said Gheit of Oppenheimer .
BP 's chief financial officer , Byron Grote , said that in calculating the size of anticipated federal fines under the Clean Water Act , BP assumed that it was not guilty of negligence .
By doing so , it pegged its fines at $ 1,100 per barrel spilled .
If found negligent , BP would have to pay $ 4,300 a barrel .
It would also have to pay 100 percent of the fines , while Anadarko Petroleum and Mitsui , its partners in the lease , would not have to share the cost of the penalties .
Critics in Congress decried the company 's failure to say precisely how much oil it thinks has spilled into the gulf .
Hayward said only that BP had used a number around the middle of published estimates , which most <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> have been 35,000 to 60,000 barrels <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> .
In addition , BP 's financial statement reflected an offsetting tax benefit from lower earnings .
Because the reserve for claims is deducted from profit , BP will not pay $ 9.9 billion in taxes that it would have otherwise owed .
Bracing for unknown costs , BP also said that it would shrink its outstanding debt to $ 10 billion to $ 15 billion , from its <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> $ 23.2 billion .
Dudley assumed his new title with modesty .
He said he has the ` ` greatest respect '' for Hayward .
` ` I did not seek out this job , '' he said in a conference call with journalists .
` ` I was asked to step into these shoes . ''
But in Washington , some people were ready to bid good riddance to Hayward , who had aggravated public anger by saying he wanted his ` ` life back '' and by going sailing on his yacht on his return to England after weeks on the gulf coast and in Washington .
` ` While it 's <TIMEX3 tid="t36" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> happy sailing for Tony Hayward , rough conditions will persist in the Gulf of Mexico for years to come because of his failed leadership , '' Markey said .
` ` The new leaders of BP will have an uphill climb to correct the legacy left by Hayward , indelibly inked by the disaster in the gulf . '' ''
