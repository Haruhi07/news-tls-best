<TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-05-28">Friday</TIMEX3> , <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-05-28">May 28 , 2010</TIMEX3> ; <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="TIME" value="2010-05-28T13:00">1:00 PM</TIMEX3> Bill Nye , the Science Guy , was online <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-05-28">Friday</TIMEX3> , <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010-05-28">May 28</TIMEX3> , at <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="TIME" value="2010-05-28T13:00">1 p.m.</TIMEX3> ET to discuss the Gulf oil spill and the latest efforts to cap the well , including the ` ` top kill '' maneuver .
Chantilly , Va. : Why is the oil still gushing out after <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P1M" mod="MORE_THAN">more than a month</TIMEX3> ?
I always assumed they need pumps and other equipment to get the oil to the surface .
Where is the pressure coming from to continue to let the oil out of the well ?
Sarasota , Fla. : BP has not been clear about the quantity of mud versus oil coming out of their gushing pipe .
There seems to be uncertainly interpreting the video .
But could n't they determine the relative quantities from a quick , simple analysis of the fluid they are pumping to the surface ?
-- College Park , Md.
: Why ca n't we use explosives to collapse the leaking well ?
Anonymous : Why is difficult to recreate enough pressure to push the oil back down into the reservoir via the top kill .
Presumably , when they pumped out the mud and replaced it with sea water , there was a situation where the mud 's weight was enough , why is n't it enough <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> ?
The first question is a great to open the forum .
I 'd like to follow up that question with the question .
What is the pipe 's , that is <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> broken at the sea floor , capacity for non - flow pressure along its walls , i.e. what 's preventing the <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> capping effort from causing the pipe to blow out underground given the pressure is so great ?
St. Croix , USVI : In order to extract oil from the earth -LRB- whether beneath the sea or above -RRB- do n't you need to have a pumping mechanism in place ?
Once this well was opened , does it mean it could just pour oil until resources were diminished ?
Could a natural disaster like an earthquake cause the same type of oil leak beneath the sea ?
Baseball : Wikipedia says you have switched your allegiance from the Mariners to the Nats ?
I noticed that there 's an ad on this page for 10 cents off per gallon at Shell .
Back to my question : do you think within your lifetime , you will see an end to oil\/gas usage ?
Ashton , Md. : Sorry to be off - topic , but my kids and I are wondering if you 'll ever do more episodes of Bill Nye the Science Guy ?
Anonymous : With the pressure from the mud vs. pressure from the oil , is it likely that the pressure will build in the tube and explode causing an even bigger hole ?
Washington , D.C. : I ' ve heard a lot about proposed chemical dispersants , but I ' m not sure what effect they will have in mitigating any damage .
-LRB-
When I add soap to a sink of oily water , the oil does n't disappear .
-RRB-

What do you think the immediate benefits of dispersants are ?
Do the benefits outweigh the drawbacks ?
D.C.
: Why is the procedure called a ` ` top kill ? ''
Huntsville , Ala. :
My comment -- after 30 yrs + in thermoset polyurethane experience I think the leakage may be stopped by pumping a highly reactive chemical system either polyurea -LRB- example truck bed spray -RRB- or polyurethane -LRB- example skateboard wheels -RRB- into the pipe .

Either system cld be catalyzed to react almost instantly at the temperature and pressure in that pipe .
Augusta , Ga. :
Any projections about the how toxic this oil is to the green things in the Gulf ?
-LRB-
The oceans phytoplankton produce 90 percent of the world 's oxygen and deserve consideration for their work for us and the sustaining diversity we need .
-RRB- McMinnville , Ore. :
This does n't pertain to the leak itself , but about the use of dispersants .
Is n't crude oil anionic ?
Why not use a cationic substance to bind the oil ?
I work in the wine industry , and we use bentonite clay to bind layby proteins for clarification in white wines .
Louisville , Ky. :
I did just tweet this .
There is a video suggesting the use of hay or straw to sop up -LRB- not stop -RRB- the oil spill .
It is so simple -- it sounds like a joke , but watch the video at How to clean up the oil spill -LRB-
YouTube -RRB-
I 'd love your comment .
Who is winning these days between you and Bagely ?
Richmond , Va. : Is the oil spill going to be severe enough to eliminate or lead to the extinction of any species of marine life unique to the Gulf Coast ?

Michigan : First , thank you Bill Nye , for making science fun and interesting to so many youths .
Second , after just looking at the live feed , it certainly look like there is much oil still coming out with even more mud .
Do you think this effort will work ?
and do you think that they could make things worse ?
A major collapse of the sea floor would do what to the oil underneath ?
could n't we seal up the well with somethin more permanent than mud ?
or are they trying to keep the options of redrilling this well later ?
Harrisburg , Pa. :
My question comes from a bit more ignorance , I ' m afraid .
They said that they would know right away if it was failing , but would n't know if it was successful for <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DURATION" value="PXD">several days</TIMEX3> .
Laurel , Md. : Charles Krauthammer writes <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2010-05-28">today</TIMEX3> that offshore drilling has been forced into keep water by environmental regulations discouraging drilling in safer environments closer to shore .
If this well had been in only 1,000 feet of water , would it have been solved by <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> because human divers could work on it ?
Rockville , Md.
: Why ca n't they just crimp the broken end of the pipe ?
Is n't that what the blowout preventer was supposed to do ?
Do n't we have a pair of ` ` super pliers '' that can do the job ?
San Antonio , Tex . :
It sounds like all that pressure is going to be really hard to contain .
What are the chances of attaching another valve to the failed BOP ?
Columbia , Md. : What 's so special about golf balls in this instance ?
Why not tennis balls ?
GSA across the street from Interior : Even if the well is ` ` permanantly sealed '' wo n't BP and the Federal Government have to monitor this well forever ?
Bill Nye :
Thanks for all the great questions .
Read them over ; look at all the ideas you all have .
There 's bound to be a few good ones in there .
Keep up the good work .
Let 's change the world .
