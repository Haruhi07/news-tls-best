With mud continuing to battle oil in an attempted ` ` top kill '' of the leaking well at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico , the historic scale of the disaster became clearer <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2010-05-27">Thursday</TIMEX3> when scientists said the mile - deep well has been spewing 12,000 to 19,000 barrels of oil <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> , far more than previously estimated .
The new figure supports what many observers have assumed from the images of oil slicking the gulf surface , slathering beaches and spurting from a pipe on the sea floor : This is the worst oil spill in U.S. history .
President Obama , feeling pressure to act in a crisis <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> in its sixth week , yanked the exploratory drilling permits for 33 deepwater rigs in the gulf and suspended planned exploration in two areas off the coast of Alaska .
He announced the moves at a news conference carried on cable TV channels that simultaneously showed the live video feed of effluent billowing from the cracked riser pipe at the bottom of the gulf .
Obama pushed back on suggestions that , as he put it , ` ` BP is off running around doing whatever it wants and nobody is minding the store . ''
He said that his administration is doing all it can , but that , when it comes to plugging the leak , ` ` the federal government does not possess superior technology to BP . ''
The eventful day included the first prominent administrative casualty of the crisis .
Elizabeth Birnbaum , head of Minerals Management Service , which issues permits for offshore drilling , resigned .
The political developments continue to be overshadowed by a technological struggle that has no precedent .
Whether the top kill is going to work remains highly uncertain .
The maneuver is a brute - force , yet delicately calibrated , injection of heavy drilling mud into the blowout preventer atop the wellhead .
As the mud is pumped from ships at the surface , the hydrocarbons should be forced back down the well toward their source in a porous reservoir called the Macondo field , about 21\/2 miles below the floor of the gulf .
It has not been smooth sailing .
After pumping mud for <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="PT9H" mod="APPROX">about nine hours</TIMEX3> on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-05-26">Wednesday</TIMEX3> , BP put the pumping on hold throughout the day <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010-05-27">Thursday</TIMEX3> while it pondered the initial results .
The company resumed <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="TIME" value="2010-05-27TEV">Thursday evening</TIMEX3> .
` ` Nothing has gone wrong or unanticipated , '' Doug Suttles , BP 's chief operating officer , told reporters .
He said engineers hope to improve on their initial performance by preceding a mud injection with a blast of rubber balls and other rough - textured materials -- a ` ` junk shot '' -- to clog the blowout preventer and force more mud down into the hole , rather than shooting it out of the leaks in the riser .
` ` We did believe we did pump some mud down the well bore .
We obviously pumped a lot of mud out the riser , '' Suttles said .
BP Managing Director Bob Dudley likened the top kill to an ` ` arm - wrestling match with two fairly equal - rated forces .
Or taking two fire hoses and driving them together , trying to overcome the other . ''
The well wo n't be considered killed until the mud injection has been followed by cement to permanently plug it -- at which point the news would be carried by ` ` the roar coming out of this building , '' the deadpan Suttles said .
