An earlier version of this op - ed referred to the Natural Resources Damages Assessment process as prescribed by the Ocean Pollution Act of <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="1990">1990</TIMEX3> .
It is the Oil Pollution Act of <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="1990">1990</TIMEX3> .
Research on gulf oil spill should n't take a backseat to litigation The Gulf of Mexico has been inundated with the equivalent of more than an Exxon Valdez - size spill <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="SET" value="P1W" quant="EACH">each week</TIMEX3> -- threatening the health of the marine environment , the public and the livelihoods of gulf residents .
From the first day of the Deepwater Horizon disaster , Gulf Coast residents have wanted to know how much oil was spilling ; where it was coming from and where it was going ; what effects the oil would have on coastal ecosystems and how fast they would recover ; and how this tragic event was going to affect their health , their jobs and their communities .
Unfortunately , the government , BP and scientists were not prepared to answer those questions .
<TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="XXXX-XX">Three months later</TIMEX3> , we still have more questions than answers .
The major federal scientific response to date has been focused on the Natural Resources Damages Assessment -LRB-
NRDA -RRB- process prescribed by the Oil Pollution Act of <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="1990">1990</TIMEX3> , as the government begins to build its case against BP to ensure that the nation is reimbursed for the immense damage done to the environment .
It has also been widely reported that BP has been engaging academic scientists for its NRDA defense .
Billions of dollars are at stake , so litigation is likely to go on for years .
Because the NRDA is an adversarial process , both sides will seek to use science in a legal context , with the administration attempting to maximize financial damages and BP trying to minimize them .
Much of the information obtained from research and monitoring will be tied up in the courts rather than being made publicly available and scrutinized .
The broader scientific community will be unable to use much of this information to understand the ongoing effects of the oil and dispersants , or to help our nation 's policymakers better prepare for future accidents .
Early on , there was hope for development of a comprehensive science plan that would enable the nation to learn from this disaster and better understand the effects of oil spills on the marine environment and coastal communities .
The aim was to integrate the efforts of federal agencies with academic research capacities .
An initial effort to provide support for such a plan was spearheaded by BP , which announced in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-05">May</TIMEX3> that it would launch a 10 - year , $ 500 million research initiative based on a peer - reviewed process separate from the NRDA process .
Results from research funded by this initiative were to be made available to the public and subject to peer review .
We hoped that this research would be based in part on recommendations that resulted from a symposium convened at Louisiana State University in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010-06">June</TIMEX3> , when more than 200 researchers from across the nation discussed the scientific needs for understanding the ecological impact -- such as the spill 's toxicity and effect on the food chain -- and other consequences of oil , gas and dispersant contamination .
While $ 30 million was allocated , the BP research initiative is unfortunately on hold .
<TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2010-W24" mod="MORE_THAN">More than six weeks ago</TIMEX3> , the White House requested that the company work closely with Gulf Coast governors and state and local environmental and health authorities to determine the next steps for this initiative .
A decision has yet to be reached .
Our nation needs a comprehensive science plan to learn from and respond better to this tragedy .
Those working in academia , federal and state government , nongovernmental organizations , and industry need to be consulted and included .
The federal government must also make funding available , apart from the NRDA process , to enable independent , peer - reviewed science to be undertaken .
We need these things <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> .
<TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EVERY">Every day</TIMEX3> of delay means more valuable data is not being collected , and ultimately lost .
After the Exxon Valdez spill , it took <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="P3Y" mod="MORE_THAN">more than three years</TIMEX3> for a research initiative to come to fruition , a terrible loss of scientific opportunity and information critical to planning and implementing better responses to future spills .
President Obama signed an executive order <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2010-W29">last week</TIMEX3> establishing a national policy for the stewardship of the oceans , coasts and Great Lakes .
The White House needs to express similar leadership when it comes to the gulf region 's marine environment and the research necessary to understand it with respect to the spill .
We hope this can still be a ` ` teachable moment '' and not another lost opportunity .
