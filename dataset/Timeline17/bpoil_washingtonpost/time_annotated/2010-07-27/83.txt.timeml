For a London - based petroleum company that relies largely on oil produced in the United States and Russia , Robert Dudley might be just the ticket .
BP 's board is expected to announce <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-07-27" mod="START">early Tuesday</TIMEX3> that it has picked Dudley , who grew up in Hattiesburg , Miss. , and later spent <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P8Y">eight years</TIMEX3> working in Russia , to become the company 's chief executive , cutting short the turbulent tenure of British geologist Tony Hayward , who has been caught in the vortex of U.S. public anger over the Gulf of Mexico oil spill .
The choice of the even - keeled Dudley , who would become the first American to run the company formerly known as British Petroleum , would represent a fresh start for a firm that has been soiled by the massive oil spill .
` ` It turns a new page , and it starts to look to the future , '' said Daniel Yergin , chairman of IHS Cambridge Energy Research Associates .
` ` I think Bob has both the technical competence and a broad view of the industry and where it fits into the world . ''
The mere prospect of Dudley becoming BP 's chief executive marks a cultural shift for a corporate goliath that suffered from identity issues ever since it acquired three big U.S. oil firms -- Amoco , Arco and Sohio -- <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="200X" mod="MORE_THAN">more than a decade ago</TIMEX3> .
Although British BP chiefs had shuttled back and forth by plane from their St. James Square headquarters in London to their U.S. empire , the cultural gulf proved too big .
And after the <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> drilling rig explosion killed 11 workers and set off the largest oil spill in U.S. history , Hayward struck several wrong notes with an angry American public .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-07-26">Monday</TIMEX3> , Florida Attorney General Bill McCollum -LRB- R -RRB- said that throughout the spill , Hayward ` ` has appeared disingenuous , disinterested , and often dismissive of what our state , our businesses and our residents are suffering . ''
In some ways , picking Dudley is like reaching back to the past to move into the future .
He worked for Amoco -LRB- formerly known as Standard Oil Co. of Indiana -RRB- for <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P20Y" mod="LESS_THAN">nearly 20 years</TIMEX3> in the United States , Britain and Russia .
When BP bought the company in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="1998">1998</TIMEX3> , Dudley , then Amoco 's general manager for strategy , made the leap to BP .
His U.S. background might prove an asset both to him and the company .
Forty percent of BP 's shareholders live in the United States , and BP is the largest producer of oil in the United States .
With Congress contemplating a ban on BP operating on federal lands , and with the Justice Department weighing criminal charges in connection with the rig blowout , Dudley 's background and temperament could help BP navigate U.S. political waters and protect the company 's ability to do business here .
` ` BP has two vulnerabilities , political and legal , '' said Robin West , chairman of PFC Energy , a Washington consulting firm .
` ` The political vulnerability is that Congress wants to punish BP . ''
Dudley also has experience around the world .

While at Amoco , he negotiated projects in the South China Sea and in Russia .
At BP , he fit in well .
He played a key role in politically sensitive negotiations over the construction of a pipeline in Azerbaijan .
Later , he ran BP 's TNK - BP joint venture in Moscow , and helped oversee improvements in safety , accounting and drilling practices in old Soviet fields .
His five - year stint ended in discord with BP 's Russian billionaire partners ; after being denied a visa , Dudley ran operations from abroad until an accord was reached on a successor .
` ` He has demonstrated an ability to operate successfully under pressure , '' West said .
` ` This is a guy who has really been battle - tested twice . ''
A source close to the Russian partners in TNK - BP said that the dispute in Russia arose because ` ` we felt our strategies were diverging .
It had nothing to do with Dudley .
He 's a competent manager and has the potential to be a successful CEO .
We partner with institutions , not individuals .
Whoever they pick is their decision . ''
