<TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-08-25">Wednesday</TIMEX3> , <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-08-25">August 25 , 2010</TIMEX3> ; <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="TIME" value="2010-08-25T20:49">8:49 PM</TIMEX3> HOUSTON -
The Macondo well gushes no more , but the lawyers are just getting started .
They go wall to wall in a Hilton hotel conference room , sitting at long tables that face the outnumbered investigators assigned to find the cause of the <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> Deepwater Horizon disaster .
The thermometer may be hitting 100 outside , but the room is kept perfect for the men and women in power suits , many from Washington , Chicago , New Orleans and Dallas .
The investigation , a joint operation by the Coast Guard and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management , is supposed to help the government determine what went wrong and recommend reforms .
But the hearings have largely been taken over by lawyers for the major players in the disaster - including BP , rig owner Transocean and the contractor for the cement job , Halliburton - who are trying to prepare for what are sure to be many civil trials to come .
They are generally civil to one another , but their clients have conflicting interests , with billions of dollars at stake and a Justice Department probe shadowing everything .
` ` The 900 - pound gorilla in the room is the criminal investigation , '' said Pat Fanning , the attorney for one of the top Transocean managers on the rig .
Testimony <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2010-W34">this week</TIMEX3> has focused on usual suspects : the construction of the well and maintenance of the blowout preventer .
But who 's to blame , what piece of equipment or procedure proved fatally deficient , or to what degree the calamity could have been foreseen are issues the lawyers will likely tangle over for years to come .
In a new twist , BP has declared that a Halliburton employee , Jesse Gagliano , who warned that the cement job on the Macondo well might not function properly , should have stopped the operation outright if he had real doubts about safety .
Gagliano testified <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2010-08-24">Tuesday</TIMEX3> that he told BP engineers on <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2010-04-15">April 15</TIMEX3> that if BP proceeded with the cement job as designed , it would have a gas - flow problem .
<TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2010-04-18">Three days later</TIMEX3> , he wrote that , with only seven centralizers to center the casing , ` ` this well is considered to have a SEVERE gas flow problem . ''
Gagliano said he and the BP engineers worked together , late into <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="TIME" value="2010-04-15TNI">the night of April 15</TIMEX3> , trying to resolve the problem .
He recommended that BP use 21 centralizers to keep the casing properly positioned .

But even though an additional 15 were flown to the rig , BP chose not to use them .
The cementing job proceeded with six .
Under cross - examination by BP lawyer Rick Godfrey , Gagliano acknowledged that in some documents , as well as during several conference calls with BP and Transocean managers , he did not cite the gas - flow potential or raise other alarms .
` ` BP had made their decision , '' Gagliano said .
` ` They had decided not to follow my recommendation . ''
After he testified , BP released a pointed statement : ` ` If Halliburton had significant concerns about its ability to provide a safe and high - quality cement job in the Macondo well , then it had the responsibility and obligation to refuse to perform the job .
To do otherwise would have been morally repugnant . ''
