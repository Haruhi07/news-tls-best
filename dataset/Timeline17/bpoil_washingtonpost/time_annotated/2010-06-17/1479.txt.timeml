How many companies could take a $ 20 billion body blow and still be left standing ?
The amount of money BP said it would plunk into an escrow fund for oil - spill claims is enough to cover the entire NASA budget for <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> .
It 's enough to buy all the shares of the Kellogg Co. .

And it 's larger than the annual economic output of 90 countries .
But BP is an unusual company .
It made profits of $ 5.6 billion in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-Q1">the first quarter of this year</TIMEX3> and $ 14 billion in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3> .
It produces about 2.5 million barrels <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> of crude oil from Russia to Angola , from Britain 's North Sea to Alaska 's North Slope .
Until <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2010-06-16">Wednesday</TIMEX3> , BP also had been planning to pay out $ 10.5 billion in dividends <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2010">this year</TIMEX3> , which would still have left it with $ 5 billion to $ 10 billion in spare cash .
It could raise the money for the escrow fund <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2010">this year</TIMEX3> without borrowing another dime .
That arsenal of cash and crude has n't been enough to placate the Obama administration , however , as the company wades through the largest environmental disaster in U.S. history .
And BP has struggled to convince markets that it can meet its obligations to both investors and victims of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="P8W">eight weeks</TIMEX3> , BP stock has fallen to about half its earlier value .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2010-06-15">Tuesday</TIMEX3> , Fitch Ratings slashed the firm 's credit rating to BBB , two rungs above junk .
And early on <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="TIME" value="2010-06-16TMO">Wednesday morning</TIMEX3> , investors in credit default swaps -- an insurance - like financial instrument -- were pricing an almost 40 percent chance the oil giant would default on its debts within <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DURATION" value="P5Y">five years</TIMEX3> .
So although the deal struck at the White House on <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2010-06-16">Wednesday</TIMEX3> was designed in part to reassure Gulf Coast residents that BP would put aside enough money for their claims , it was also designed to give shareholders a sense that the financial damage was manageable and could , over time , be contained along with the oil spill .
That 's why one thing BP asked in exchange for the big escrow fund was a signal from President Obama that he was not trying to run the firm out of business .
` ` BP is a strong and viable company , '' the president said after his meeting with BP 's chairman and top executives , ` ` and it is in all of our interests that it remain so . ''
That is hard to accept for many Americans who want to punish BP .
But anything else might be counterproductive .
So far , the company , drawing on its worldwide operations , has paid for everything from National Guard troops to air quality testing by the Environmental Protection Agency , from $ 5,000 checks for shrimpers to the $ 100 million or so for each relief well .
` ` This agreement underscores that as long as we need oil , Big Petroleum is better than Bankrupt Petroleum , '' Lincoln Mayer , a lawyer specializing in energy and antitrust at McDermott Will & Emery , said in an e - mail .
` ` Few companies could afford a $ 20 billion mistake .
BP is one of them , and that 's a good thing . ''
Investment analysts appeared reassured after the White House meeting .
` ` It takes the political heat off the company and it steadies the ship in rough waters , '' said Fadel Gheit , an oil analyst at Oppenheimer .
` ` BP is stabilizing its financial position so it can handle cleanup costs and damages . ''
BP stock rose 1.4 percent on <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2010-06-16">Wednesday</TIMEX3> , closing at $ 31.85 a share .

And the cost of BP credit default swaps dipped slightly , indicating a bit less anxiety about corporate default .
So how does a company come up with $ 20 billion ?
BP 's chairman , Carl - Henric Svanberg , said the firm will suspend its dividend for three quarters , starting with the payment that had been scheduled for <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2010-06-14">Monday</TIMEX3> .
That will give it $ 7.8 billion in cash .
