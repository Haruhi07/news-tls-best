Pick a number : 12,600 barrels ... 20,000 ... 21,500 ... 25,000 ... 30,000 ... 40,000 ... 50,000 .
Scientists put every one of those numbers in play <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2010-06-10">Thursday</TIMEX3> as they struggled to come up with a solid estimate of how much oil is gushing <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EACH">each day</TIMEX3> from the black geyser at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico .
The one scientific certainty : It 's a lot -- and more than some of the same scientists thought just <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">a couple of weeks ago</TIMEX3> .
It 's so much that the crews trying to siphon it to the surface are going to need a bigger boat .
Early in the crisis , BP and the federal government repeatedly said that the Deepwater Horizon well was spewing about 5,000 barrels -LRB- 210,000 gallons -RRB- <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> into the gulf .

But the new estimates , released <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-06-10">Thursday</TIMEX3> by government - appointed scientists , show that the well most likely produces 5,000 barrels before breakfast .
One team that has studied video taken of the leaking riser pipe before it was cut and capped <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-W22">last week</TIMEX3> has concluded that the well was most likely producing 25,000 to 30,000 barrels <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> .
If that estimate is on target , and if the flow has been more or less consistent since the <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> blowout , the hydrocarbon reservoir 21\/2 miles below the sea floor has gushed five to six times the amount spilled in Alaskan waters in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="1989">1989</TIMEX3> by the Exxon Valdez .
Put it another way : It 's roughly one Valdez spill <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="SET" value="P1W" quant="EVERY">every week</TIMEX3> .
Nearly two Olympic - size swimming pools of oil <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EVERY">every day</TIMEX3> .
Another scientific team , which analyzed satellite images , has come up with a somewhat more modest estimate of 12,600 to 21,500 barrels <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> , just a slight uptick from the team 's earlier finding .
Or the flow could be much higher still : A team led by scientists from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution has studied the leak with instruments normally used in research on deep - sea hydrothermal vents .
Its initial estimate puts the flow at 25,000 to 50,000 barrels <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> , said U.S. Geological Survey Director Marcia McNutt , who leads the teams of scientists collectively known as the Flow Rate Technical Group .
` ` These numbers are all over the board , '' she said in a conference call with reporters .
In response to a question , McNutt said that 20,000 to 40,000 barrels is the most plausible range , but she emphasized that the findings are preliminary and that the techniques have inherent limitations .
The flow rate is significant on several fronts .
First , it gives the government and BP a sense of how much capacity they 'll need among surface ships to handle all the oil gushing out of the well and up a pipe to the Discoverer Enterprise drill ship , which is capable of processing about 18,000 barrels <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> .
Other ships are being added to the effort .
Second , the fines that BP faces for polluting the gulf will be tied to how much oil has leaked .
Third , the higher figures call into question the circumstances that led to the much lower estimates of the spill early in the crisis .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2010-04-28">April 28</TIMEX3> , after having received estimates of the size of the spill from BP and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , the Coast Guard announced the 5,000 - barrels - a - day estimate .
Not until <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2010-05-27">May 27</TIMEX3> did the flow rate group increase the estimate to 12,000 to 25,000 barrels .
