Former Labor secretary Robert Reich wants to place BP 's U.S. operations in temporary receivership .
Sen. Ron Wyden -LRB-
D - Ore .
-RRB- wants the oil giant to suspend its dividend payments .
Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. is weighing criminal charges .
And lawyers in more than a hundred lawsuits want BP to pay billions of dollars in damages for harm done to people 's health , the environment and businesses .
` ` At this stage , it is impossible to predict the longer - term cost of environmental remediation , claims and litigation , but they will be sizable , '' BP chief executive Tony Hayward said in a conference call with investment analysts <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2010-06-04">Friday</TIMEX3> .
So would anyone in his right mind buy shares in this company ?
Despite the fatal explosion on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig that triggered the massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico , 10 of the 14 leading investment analysts tracking BP have ` ` buy '' ratings on the company , including one who has upgraded his recommendation .
The reason : BP is a colossus with more than 18 billion barrels of proven reserves , operations in more than 100 countries , oil production everywhere from Angola to Russia to Alaska and a new agreement in Iraq .
Even after paying out its regularly quarterly dividends at a rate of $ 10.5 billion <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> , BP will still have $ 5 billion to $ 10 billion in cash flow , depending on the price of oil .
And its relatively modest debt level means that it could also borrow money if necessary .
` ` So we ' ve got considerable firepower here to deal with the costs , any costs as they accrue , '' Byron Grote , BP 's chief financial officer said in the conference call .
Many analysts think the staggering drop in the price of BP 's stock since the <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> explosion has been too steep .
Mark Gilman , an analyst with Benchmark , boosted his rating to ` ` buy back '' <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010-05-26">May 26</TIMEX3> , saying that the reduction in BP 's market value since the spill began ` ` implies gross , pre - tax environmental claims and costs to be in the $ 80 billion to $ 110 billion range , which we believe to be unrealistically high . ''
In an interview <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2010-06-03">Thursday</TIMEX3> , he said , ` ` while we 're not prepared to make a cost estimate , we 're comfortable saying it 's not going to be in that magnitude . ''
Most people , however , have n't been following Gilman 's advice .
After he upgraded his rating , BP 's shares have plunged even further .
Since the disaster , the stock has sunk 39 percent , erasing more than $ 70 billion of market value .

Other companies involved in the well have also tumbled , including rig - owner Transocean , with shares down 46 percent and service - provider Halliburton , down 33 percent .
Lease partner Anadarko Petroleum 's shares are off 40 percent .
-RRB- BP shareholders are nervous , and while the oil giant has the resources to survive such a crisis , estimates of the cost to the company keep rising .
Credit Suisse on <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2010-06-03">Thursday</TIMEX3> issued a report that clean - up costs could total $ 15 billion to $ 23 billion and that legal claims could drain $ 14 billion more from BP 's coffers .
Raymond James & Associates <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2010-W22">this week</TIMEX3> nearly tripled its estimate of costs to $ 7.5 billion -- not including any criminal or civil liabilities .
And the three leading ratings agencies -- Moody 's Investor Service , Fitch Ratings and Standard & Poor 's -- lowered their credit ratings on BP 's debt .
Pavel Molchanov , an analyst with Raymond James , downgraded the stock to market perform -- neither better nor worse than the market average -- <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2010-04-29">April 29</TIMEX3> , <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DURATION" value="P9D">nine days</TIMEX3> after the accident , and does n't expect an improvement as long as the negative headlines and oil continue to flow from the gulf .
