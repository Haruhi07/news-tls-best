What BP should have done <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="TIME" value="2010-11-17TMO">This morning</TIMEX3> a committee of the National Academy of Engineering released its interim report on the BP oil spill -LRB-
here 's the pdf of the report -RRB- .
It 's written in committee - speak and is a little chewy at key moments , such as when it addresses whether BP traded safety for dollars .
There 's a general -LRB- and rather obvious -RRB- message to the oil industry and to government regulators that they need to upgrade their personnel , their training and take more seriously the hazards of drilling holes in the deep sea .
Here 's a key passage that gives you a flavor of the report : The often - made assertion at the MBI hearing -LRB- a joint investigation of the Coast Guard and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management , Regulation and Enforcement -RRB- that safety was never compromised suggests that the risks that are an inherent part of engineering processes in this and many other industries were not fully recognized .
As it appears from the testimony that many of the pivotal choices made for the drilling operation and temporary abandonment of the well were likely to result in less cost and less time relative to other options , the committee will be examining the use of a separate path of reporting and oversight employed elsewhere to ensure that decisions made in the interest of cost and schedule do not unreasonably compromise safety .
Lurking in that paragraph is a key insight .
The line about no - tradeoff of safety and cost carries a footnote to the testimony of John Guide , the Macondo well team leader , who worked at BP 's Houston office .
As the committee notes , the well team leader ` ` was responsible for cost and schedule in addition to decisions affecting the integrity and safety of the well . ''
So he 's always got two things in mind : efficiency and safety .
And they tug against each other , inevitably .
Doing that extra cement test ?

Waiting around for parts to be delivered ?
How long do you wait for the cement to cure before going on to the next step ?
Should you speed things up by doing simultaneous operations -LRB- say , offloading mud to a supply boat while doing a pressure test on the well -RRB- even if that complicates the monitoring of the well ?
Go back to that paragraph , and the line about ` ` the risks that are an inherent part of engineering processes in this and many other industries were not fully recognized . ''
Here 's one way to translate that into English : This is dangerous stuff !
The only truly , 100 percent safe thing to do is not drill at all !
But of course , there 's reality .
We use a lot of oil in the USA .
We 're addicted to it .
It has to come from somewhere .
If you want domestically produced oil you have to go where the oil is , such as the Gulf of Mexico .
And there 's a lot of oil in the deep water .
Here 's the fact , though : Even if you build the case that we need offshore drilling , and even if you believe we need offshore deep - water drilling , you could still argue that we did n't need the Macondo well .
BP could have -- and arguably should have -- abandoned the Macondo well .
Not temporarily abandoned , which is what it was doing on <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> when the well blew out and the Deepwater Horizon turned into an inferno .
BP was converting the exploratory well into a production well and was going to plug it with cement and let an oil platform produce the oil later on .
But BP had the option -- and considered the option , according to witness testimony in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-10">October</TIMEX3> -LRB-
I ca n't put my finger on it
but I remember it , and it got some press -RRB- -- of saying , in effect , ` ` This well is a nightmare -- and we quit . ''
The Gulf of Mexico is a hard place to drill in general -LRB-
it is famously ` ` overpressured '' and gassy -RRB- , but this well had special challenges .
A quick primer : Wells are drilled using heavy ` ` mud '' that serves multiple functions , from cooling the drilling bit to circulating out the chips of rock to , most importantly , helping control the well and keeping it from blowing out .
But the mud has to be the right weight .
If it 's too heavy , it can escape into the reservoirs down there in the rock .
If it 's too light , it 'll get bullied by the hydrocarbons .
There 's something called the pore pressure and something called the fracture gradient and what you ideally would like to see in a well is a big difference between the two .
But this well had a narrow window in which to operate .
The mud weight had to be very precisely adjusted .
<TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2010-11-17TMO">This morning</TIMEX3> I talked to Mark Zoback , one of the NAE committee members .
Zoback , a professor of geophysics at Stanford , said , ` ` The cement job may have been doomed from the beginning . ''
He pointed out that there were five reservoirs or ` ` sands '' down in the Macondo well , with differing qualities and pressures .
The top sand was a brine sand , for example , and it had greater pore pressure than the sands with oil and gas farther down .
The BP team tried to cement the whole suite of sands in a single job , with a single cement density , and that was a recipe for failure , Zoback said .
` ` It may have been ill advised to try to cement off all five of these sands in one operation because they had to thread the needle with respect to the pressures , '' he said .
They could have tried other cement strategies , other well designs , other tests .
They could have done a lot of things differently .

And it might have worked .
And Macondo might be sitting there neatly plugged with cement , waiting in the gulf for someone to drill it again and pull out all that oil .

But I keep thinking of something that Shane Roshto , one of the 11 men killed in the blowout , said to his wife , Natalie , at home before returning to the Deepwater Horizon : ` ` Mother Nature does not want to be drilled there . ''
Thanks for answering a bunch of the questions I had about about that oil well .
This is the first I ' m hearing about the five different sands and the problem of cementing them .
It 's also pretty fascinating to learn that the entire cementing operation might have been doomed from the git - go .
I confess I have n't followed all the stories as closely as I might , but for me this is the first I ' m hearing of the '' ` ` This well is a nightmare -- and we quit '' theme .
We ' ve known from the beginning BP was shutting the well down ...
but with the understanding it was for later production by somebody else .
There was no ` ` we quit ; it has beant us '' aspect to it -LRB- not that I saw , anyway -RRB- .
It really shades the perspective quit a bit .
And the Roshto quote indicates some of the people on the weel knew it .
Ca n't wait for your book to come out .
While I am sure the loss of revenue from their lease for that area will cost them something in the long run , perhaps it 's for the best that they just walk away .
Turtle domes , diapirs -LRB- not to be confused with diapers -RRB- , and canopies .
Interesting that the story in the Wall Street Journal came out <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="UNDEF-this-hour-MINUS-13">13 hours ago</TIMEX3> , and the NYT published <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2010-11-16">yesterday</TIMEX3> -LRB-
but no interview with Zoback in Palo Alto -RRB- ...
Note , too , that this interim report -LRB- final report due in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2010-06">June</TIMEX3> -RRB- by the National Academy of Engineers also pointed a lot of blame at the federal Minerals Management Service .
Funny that that 's not mentioned in Joel 's write - up .
Once it was apparent that the BP leadership was going to change , he would have blocked all actions until the new team took over .
Think of all the money they would have saved .
Even fracking , mentioned in the article I linked to below in terms of drilling for natural gas , was a plot element in <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2010-W45">last week</TIMEX3> 's CSI episode -- also a concern in Texas , as the article points out .
Who did I run into or what did I read about the huge increase in drilling activities , increase in propery values , scramble for housing , going on just to the southwest of us ?
I think the team should be called ` ` Washington Pass - the - Bucks . ''
There 's the obvious animal reference .

The double entendre , given that Congress appropriates monies , plus the do - nothingness of the institution .
Comprehensive energy policy or immigration reform , anyone ?
Did anyone catch his interview <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2010-W46">this week</TIMEX3> on Morning Joe .
Of course , they changed the subject on him to the political situation , rather than letting him talk about the two disasters that occurred in his state under the management of two different administrations .
He had a lot to say about federal ineptness , and Jindal 's comments about the more <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> one definitely caught my attention .
Hard to get excited about a book from speculative press members who write that the Gulf spill may be carried by currents up the Atlantic seaboard .
Or the irrational public that did not book rooms in the Sunshine State , prompting frivolous lawsuits against BP .
Do you think the speculation led to the irrational behavior ?
I ' m having enough problems with speculative reporting by the Patriot Ledger in Quincy regarding those old bones turned up in <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="1999">1999</TIMEX3> in Scituate -- not to mention the corresponding reports compiled by the state government !

And tell me why it is that Salazar has lifted the ban on offshore drilling but BOEMRE refuses to issue any permits ?
That 's strange , is n't it ?

And have any of us changed our oil consumption behavior ?
Sometimes you are dealing with situations which get out of hand very quickly .
Little projects you do n't think are a big deal erupt into things where people are running around looking for the shot - off valves .
My last plumbing project was <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">several years ago</TIMEX3> .
I replaced both of the shower valves in our house one <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2010-SU">summer</TIMEX3> while our son was at scout camp .
That way we only needed one bathroom usable at a time .
At each phase , I shut off and drained the house
but I had to have a restart plan to get service back even if the project was n't quite done .
` You can never have too many valves ' is a good motto .
That is as long as leaky valves are n't your problem .
I do n't quite get though why the well should have been shut down permanently earlier .
The over - budget part does indicate it was n't their best work , but was it that bad earlier ?
Cassandra , I ' m with you on the Mother Nature quote .
laloomis , I thought the complaint about the Hill was that they were doing too much .
<TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> they 're Do - Nothings ?
I guess you have to spend some time on the Hill to know what goes into running the federal government .
Besides , the oly buck passing these days has been in Dub 's new book .
Do n't know anything about any books by speculative press members -LRB-
huh ?
-RRB-
Wow , talk about having information no one else has .

In other words , it is doomed .
But it does have the virtue of being true .
Sometimes the secret in any complex endeavor is to recognize and respect the limits of one 's knowledge .
This has been called the courage of uncertainty .
Alas , as we all know , in many , many cases the last thing powerful people want to hear is the phrase ` ` I do n't know . ''
When this happens the temptation to find somebody else who can exploit the ambiguity to support the position they find pleasing can be overwhelming .
And from this comes much mischief .
One afternoon in <TIMEX3 tid="t36" type="DATE" value="2009-06">June 2009</TIMEX3> , Gov. Sarah Palin was sitting in the Washington office of her friend Fred Malek , whom she met through McCain during the <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> campaign .
She was listening to the former White House aide to Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford map out logical next steps to her political career .
Focus on amassing a good record as governor , he advised her .
Run for a second term .
Develop some policy expertise .
Do some extensive overseas travel .
Generate some good will by campaigning for fellow Republicans .
Malek told me that he could tell that this was n't what Palin wanted to hear .
Here 's the problem , she replied impatiently : I ' ve got a long commute from my house to my office .
I do n't have the funds to pay for my family to travel with me , and the state wo n't pay for it , either .
I ca n't afford to have security at my home -- anybody can come up to my door , and they do .
Under the laws of Alaska , anybody can file suit or an ethics charge against me , and I have to defend it on my own .
I ' m going into debt .
Numerous decisions to proceed toward abandonment despite indications of hazard , such as the results of repeated negative - pressure tests , suggest an insufficient consideration of risk and a lack of operating discipline .
The decisions also raise questions about the adequacy of operating knowledge on the part of key personnel .
That is about the most severe beat - down I have ever read in a formal report .
I do n't see how that could have been accidental ; she must have made a checklist or something .
I wonder if Malek ever told her not to worry too much about shopping for a new dress .
Or to make nice with Lisa Murkowski .
It 's rare to see ` ` they were careless and ignorant '' in such a document .
In Our Fair City taking care of business in the waning days of my mayoralty .
Two terms of working on being more empathetic is paying off .
I can kind of , sort of , see some merit in Palin 's resignation .
Of course that could just be confidence that her successor could n't possibly be anything but better .
Did notice the annihalation detector in the diagram though , that amuses me so some reason .
Looking back , in sense he was melding Hoyle 's ` ` steady state '' theory with the opposite of the Big Bang , the ` ` Big Crunch '' .
Do n't know that I could have made a good petroleum drilling expert .
I wonder how much of Brazil 's huge , alluring , and difficult oil fields will prove undrillable , or at least not - prudently - drillable .
Bj n Lomborg 's column is n't all bad , but his best guess about sea level rise seems to be far lower than what the experts are suggesting , which is on the order of planning for as much as 5 feet rise <TIMEX3 tid="t39" type="DURATION" value="P90Y" mod="MORE_THAN">over the next 90 years</TIMEX3> .
His comments about Tokyo 's defenses against subsidence are appropriate , but perhaps more in the context of preserving New Orleans under present - day conditions than about the future .
Tokyo 's flood defenses make the ` ` improved '' defenses of New Orleans look unfit for areas inhabited by human beings .
The Netherlands has an excellent national plan for adapting to rising sea level .
While much of the Netherlands ' water management has roots in traditional practices , the national plan is a matter of extremely sophisticated engineering and environmental planning .
Doing something similar for Chesapeake Bay would be an immense undertaking .
The Everglades are unsalvageable , except to the extent that restoring natural water flow can According to geologist Harold Wanless of the University of Miami , the southern Florida metro area -LRB- specifically Miami and Ft Lauderdale -RRB- ca n't be protected by levees because the underlying rock is too porous .
Wanless thinks we need to be planning for radical shrinkage of the urban area and its eventual demise -LRB- aided by decreased rainfall and nastier hurricanes as the land area shrinks -RRB- .
Despite the thicket of inane comments on Lomborg 's column -LRB- and David Brooks -RRB- , modeling works .
It 's easy to lie with models , fool yourself with models , lead others astray , whatever .
But making mathematical models is essential to economics , population biology , running electricity grids , planning highways , drilling for oil , and any number of other things essential to making modern society work .
Much modeling requires only high school algebra and access to Microsoft Excel , which gives the functionality of matrix algebra .
He will be missed .

If the well bore is steel drill pipe encased and they are cementing the bore , how does the porosity of the sand the bore go through affect the cementing job ?

But the cementing job is to inject some cement between the casing , a sturdy steel tube , and the local geology .
The cement job fills the gap between the outer casing and the drilled surface .
As the hole is drilled down this small interspace might , or might not , be filled with cementing matter .
It 's rarely cemented all the way down .
The cementing technique and the cement itself will vary depending on the local geology -LRB- or sands , as the oil people say -RRB- , as the outer steel casing does n't vary .
The Macondo goes through alternating layers of salt and shale for about 2 miles deep ; surely the cementing job will face different challenges depending on where it 's at .
Pressure of the product and type of geology\/sand must be important in choosing the cementing technique for the segment at hand .
It seemed worth finding the original , so here it is .

I still do n't believe Palin wants to be president ; I think she 's learned her lesson that governing means actually doing the work .

But she has also learned another lesson all too well : that she can make millions by keeoing her ` ` brand '' and her face out front , AND , even more important , the incredible strokes to her ego by being the Queen Bee , the kingmaker , the powerbroker , the ` ` face '' of the Tea Party , that entire package .

So
yeah , sure , she can freely and joyously say she can beat Obama .
It 's no longer a political statement -LRB- or even a delusion -RRB- ; rather , it is simply a necessary part of her schtick , her pitch , her sales presentation .

Where has the time gone ?
All the errors accrued by not cementing each zone separately could have been remedied .
One difficulty for the layman and me has been a lack of access to the records of other wells nearby .
Obviously those records are trade secrets and I understand that .
I think a clearer picture would emerge of the engineering issues and how ` ` standard practices '' working in that geological area had emerged .
As I understand it , those sands and the intervening strata are geologically younger than other fields .
The sand grains are only loosely cemented in the sandstones .
This fact does not make the drilling uncontrollable .
It means , just as has been said , that each zone needs special attention , individual focus , when encountered .
Methods to do that have long been known and widely used .
Even if the well had cost twice as much , the profit would have still been substantial .
That 's a fact .
Tell us what is with , etc . .
