-- BP PLC is once again reporting profits even with an estimated $ 40 billion price tag for the response to its blown out well in the Gulf of Mexico .
In this waterfront city , where many lost their livelihoods to <TIMEX3 tid="t45" type="DATE" value="2010-SU">the summer</TIMEX3> of oil , a mixture of relief and melancholy greeted the news <TIMEX3 tid="t44" type="DATE" value="2010-11-02">Tuesday</TIMEX3> .
A financially healthy BP means jobs and compensation , but residents still reeling from the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history are waiting for some good news of their own .
BP said that costs related to the <TIMEX3 tid="t47" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> oil spill dragged down its third - quarter profit by more than 60 percent .
The London - based company earned $ 1.79 billion from <TIMEX3 tid="t48" type="DATE" value="2010-07">July</TIMEX3> through <TIMEX3 tid="t49" type="DATE" value="2010-09">September</TIMEX3> , compared with $ 5.3 billion <TIMEX3 tid="t51" type="DATE" value="2009-09">a year earlier</TIMEX3> .

But the fact that BP returned to profits at all , coming after a loss of $ 17.2 billion in <TIMEX3 tid="t54" type="DATE" value="2010-Q2">the second quarter</TIMEX3> , indicated the company 's operations remain solid despite the spill .
` ` That 's real good news they 're making money because at least we know they have the ability to pay us over a long period of time because we ' ve still got a lot of problems , '' said shrimp processor Rudy Lesso , whose Biloxi , Miss. business is down about 25 percent because much of the public is still afraid to eat Gulf seafood .
BP has set up a $ 20 billion compensation fund to pay victims of the oil spill , cutting roughly $ 1.7 billion in checks so far .

But the process has been slow and cumbersome for struggling Gulf coast residents .
BP 's third - quarter performance fell well short of the industry norm .
All the other major oil companies , except Chevron , have reported stronger <TIMEX3 tid="t56" type="DATE" value="2010-Q3">third quarter</TIMEX3> profits thanks to higher oil and gas prices .
The company 's $ 40 billion estimate for its overall spill response was $ 7.7 billion higher than its previous estimate provided during its second - quarter results released <TIMEX3 tid="t57" type="DATE" value="2010-SU">this summer</TIMEX3> , largely due to unanticipated additional expenses .
The company had already spent $ 11.2 billion responding to the spill by <TIMEX3 tid="t61" type="DATE" value="2010-09" mod="END">the end of September</TIMEX3> .
None of that , however , kept BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley from delivering a rosy prognosis .
` ` What I can report <TIMEX3 tid="t62" type="DATE" value="2010-11-02">today</TIMEX3> is that BP is <TIMEX3 tid="t63" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> in recovery mode , '' Dudley said <TIMEX3 tid="t64" type="DATE" value="2010-11-02">Tuesday</TIMEX3> from London .
At one point he talked about how the situation looks without the spill - an unthinkable leap for Gulf residents .
` ` Putting aside the incident ...
the BP group as a whole delivered a strong business performance throughout <TIMEX3 tid="t65" type="DATE" value="2010-Q4">the quarter</TIMEX3> in terms of both financial and safety performance , '' he added .
Ewell Smith , head of the Louisiana Seafood Promotion and Marketing Board , said people forget that oil and fishing have for decades ` ` worked side by side '' in the Gulf region .
