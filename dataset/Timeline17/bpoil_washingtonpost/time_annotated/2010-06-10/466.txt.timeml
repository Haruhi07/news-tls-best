Before the spill , the Obama administration lifted the moratorium on drilling in U.S. coastal waters as a way to address the country 's energy needs .
But most Americans <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> want fewer offshore wells -LRB- 31 percent -RRB- or the amount kept at <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> levels -LRB- 41 percent -RRB- .
Perhaps as a consequence of the spill , public support for oil and gas drilling in general is also significantly lower than it was <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="XXXX">a year ago</TIMEX3> .
And as Americans have become increasingly skeptical about such exploration , some elected representatives are <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> questioning what the government is doing to ensure that offshore exploration can take place safely .

On <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-06-09">Wednesday</TIMEX3> during a Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing , the panel 's chairman , Jeff Bingaman -LRB-
D - N.M. -RRB- , said the gulf oil spill underscores a failure of both BP and the federal government .
` ` It 's clear that prior to the explosion at the Deepwater Horizon rig neither the companies involved nor the government adequately appreciated or prepared for the risks involved in a deep - water drilling operation of this type , '' Bingaman said .
The new Post - ABC poll reveals a widespread perception that poor federal regulation was at fault in the gulf spill .
About 63 percent point a finger at inadequate enforcement of regulations , and 55 percent see an overall weak regulatory structure .
Even more , 73 percent , blame BP and its drilling partners for the accident .
And the same number are calling the spill a major environmental disaster .
In an interview <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010-06-09">Wednesday</TIMEX3> , House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Nick J. Rahall -LRB-
D - W .
Va.
-RRB- said it sometimes ` ` takes a tragedy of these proportions '' to provide the political will to impose stricter federal rules on energy exploration .
The broad concern about government inaction directly relates to public support for new drilling : Those who see a weak regulatory structure as a reason for the spill are about twice as likely to want to curb offshore drilling than are those who do n't see the need for stricter federal controls .
About half of the poll respondents , 49 percent , <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> see the gulf spill as part of a broader problem with such drilling .
Support for drilling in general has slipped from 64 percent <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2009-08">last August</TIMEX3> to 52 percent <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> .
The Post - ABC poll was conducted <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2010-06-03">June 3</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2010-06-06">6</TIMEX3> , among a random national sample of 1,004 adults .
The results from the full poll have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points . ''
