An attempt to use a mile - long tube to capture most of the oil gushing from a well at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico failed on the first try , but technicians were working <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="TIME" value="2010-05-15TNI">Saturday night</TIMEX3> to put the pipe in place , BP officials said .
The ` ` riser insertion '' tactic , which gained support from BP engineers only in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent days</TIMEX3> , is akin to inserting one straw into another straw .
The goal is to contain the oil in the main riser pipe before it reaches open water , where natural gas quickly combines with the water to form slushy methane hydrates that have complicated previous attempts to contain the leak .

But the effort ran into mechanical trouble on the first stab , BP chief operating officer Doug Suttles said .
Giving few details , he said there was a problem connecting a 5,000 - foot string of pipe to the ` ` tool '' being inserted into the damaged pipe .
The tool was retrieved by a surface ship and an adjustment was made , Suttles said .
Meanwhile , the Associated Press reported that another BP oil rig , the Atlantis , has operated in the gulf with incomplete and inaccurate engineering documents , a deficiency that prompted one BP official to warn could ` ` lead to catastrophic operator error . ''
The allegations , made by a whistleblower , were ` ` substantiated '' in a report by an independent firm hired by BP .
Also <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010-05-15">Saturday</TIMEX3> , BP resumed the spraying at depth of chemical dispersants , which break the oil into smaller pieces . ''
