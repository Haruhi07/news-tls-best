VENICE , LA . --
A tide of sludgy oil has begun washing into the fringes of Louisiana 's coastal marshes , officials said <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2010-05-18">Tuesday</TIMEX3> , as BP continued to siphon some of the oil gushing from a damaged well on the gulf floor but remained days away from trying to cap the leak .
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar told Senate committees <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-05-18">Tuesday</TIMEX3> that the company would attempt a ` ` dynamic kill '' of the oil well <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-05-22">Saturday</TIMEX3> .
That procedure involves pumping thick mud into the well in hopes of blocking the oil .
And hundreds of miles from the Louisiana coast , there was a worrisome discovery :
Tar balls , sticky clumps of decayed oil , were found <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-05-17">Monday</TIMEX3> in Key West , Fla. .
Officials said they were being tested to determine whether they came from the leaking BP well .

But the most ominous news came from south Louisiana , where the Mississippi Delta peters out into the Gulf of Mexico .
There , instead of the tar balls that had previously washed ashore from the spill , thick , brown oil was infiltrating the edges of the marshes .
` ` If I had been standing up , I would have fell to my knees , '' said Billy Nungesser , president of Plaquemines Parish , La. , about the moment that he heard the news .
Nungesser , whose parish follows the Mississippi out to sea , said the oil had been spotted at places called South Pass and Pass - a - Loutre .
` ` It 's our greatest fear . ''
If these marshes are destroyed by oil , it could mean huge losses for the area 's seafood industry and a reduction in Louisiana 's already skimpy shield against a hurricane storm surge .
` ` We 're finished .
We 're out of business '' if that happens , Nungesser said .
This news was not a huge surprise : For days , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration had predicted that thick oil might make landfall near here .
These marshes are the closest land to the spot where the Deepwater Horizon offshore drilling rig sank <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010-04-22">April 22</TIMEX3> .

But Louisiana officials said the oil 's arrival underscored the need for their radical - sounding solution : the construction of a chain of small offshore islands to block the oil from the coast .
` ` This is the first time we ' ve seen this much heavy oil this far into our wetlands , '' Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal -LRB- R -RRB- said at a news conference here in Venice , the last town before the coastal marshes begin .
` ` We know there 's a lot more heavy oil behind it that has n't made it to shore yet . ''
Also <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-05-18">Tuesday</TIMEX3> , BP said it was slowly increasing the amount of oil it was siphoning away from the leaking well , using a tube inserted into a broken - off pipe <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-05-16">Sunday</TIMEX3> .
BP said it was removing 2,000 barrels of oil <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> from the leak , up from 1,000 .
It 's not clear how much of the spilling oil that represents : Officials had first estimated the leak at 5,000 barrels <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> , but outside experts have said it appears much larger than that .
Video of the leak , released by U.S. Sens .
Bill Nelson -LRB-
D - Fla .
-RRB-
and
Barbara Boxer -LRB- D - Calif .
-RRB- , showed oil continuing to billow out of the leaking pipe , even with the siphon pipe inserted into it .
The company 's plan to stop the leak involves pumping heavy ` ` kill mud '' at 40 barrels <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="PT1M">a minute</TIMEX3> into openings in the blowout preventer , a mechanism that surrounds the drill pipe .

If the influx of mud does not clog the drill pipe , a BP spokesman said , the company could still use a ` ` junk shot '' later -- pumping larger debris such as golf balls and pieces of tire into the mechanism .
Mark Proegler , a BP spokesman , said the company had not used the mud - pumping technique earlier because it had to first gather data about pressures inside the blowout preventer .
` ` It takes a while to gather the information we need , '' he said .
So far , officials said , the oil has not caused catastrophic damage on shore : Just 23 ` ` oiled '' birds have been found dead , in contrast to the tens of thousands killed by the Exxon Valdez spill in <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="1989">1989</TIMEX3> .
But scientists are worried about vast areas of oil floating underwater , unseen .
That worry was heightened by <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2010-05-17">Monday</TIMEX3> 's discovery in Key West .
If the tar balls found there are determined to have come from the BP leak , that could mean some oil has made its way into the Inner Loop currents of the Gulf Stream .
NOAA Administrator Jane Lubchenco said that oil swept up in the <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> might take eight to <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="P10D">10 days</TIMEX3> to reach the Florida Keys .
Exxon Mobil , meanwhile , said it had delayed plans to start drilling an exploration well <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2010-W20">this week</TIMEX3> in the Gulf of Mexico .
