Thad W. Allen can finally retire <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> .
Allen , 61 , was a U.S. Coast Guard admiral when he was appointed ` ` national incident commander '' for the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
He retired from the Coast Guard , as scheduled , on <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-06-30">June 30</TIMEX3> - but continued to oversee the spill response as a civilian .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010-10-01">Friday</TIMEX3> , <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P11W">11 weeks</TIMEX3> after the runaway well was capped <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-07-15">July 15</TIMEX3> , Allen announced that the ` ` national incident command '' was being dismantled .
The response to the oil spill will continue , under the command of a lower - ranking Coast Guard admiral based in New Orleans .
As of <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010-W38">last week</TIMEX3> , about 22,600 people and 1,381 vessels were still involved in cleaning up oil along the coast .
But Allen , whose military buzz cut and continuing love for nautical metaphors made an odd contrast with his new business - casual clothes , will be off the job .
` ` As I transition to a new phase of my professional life , '' he said in a statement <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="TIME" value="2010-10-01TMO">Friday morning</TIMEX3> , ` ` I want to thank the thousands of individuals ... who worked tirelessly to contain the discharge , shut in the well , clean up the oil and mitigate the impacts of the spill . ''
Allen , who served <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="P40Y" mod="LESS_THAN">nearly 40 years</TIMEX3> in the Coast Guard , said <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2010-10-01">Friday</TIMEX3> that he will join the Rand Corp. as a senior fellow , starting <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2010-10-04">Monday</TIMEX3> .
Allen had planned to join Rand in <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2010-05">May</TIMEX3> , but his transition was delayed by the oil spill , according to a company news release .
Rand does research and analysis on homeland security , environmental and national security issues .
<TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="TIME" value="2010-10-01TAF">Friday afternoon</TIMEX3> , President Obama said that he was ` ` profoundly grateful '' to Allen for his ` ` years of dedicated service '' to the nation and for his leadership in the spill response effort .
` ` At a time when he could have enjoyed a well - deserved retirement from the United States Coast Guard , Admiral Allen stepped up to the plate and served his country when his skills and experience were urgently needed , '' Obama said in a statement .
Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano issued a statement praising Allen 's handling of the crisis .
` ` The BP oil spill presented unique challenges and required an aggressive , all - of - government approach , '' Napolitano said .
Also <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2010-10-01">Friday</TIMEX3> , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced the reopening of 5,628 square miles of the gulf for fishing .
The newly reopened area , off the coast of Louisiana just west of the Mississippi Delta , means that just 11 percent of federal waters in the gulf are closed to fishing .
At the height of the spill , 37 percent were closed .
