BP 's three - day effort to throttle the leaking gulf oil well with multiple blasts of heavy mud has failed .
The attempted ` ` top kill '' of the well was abandoned <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="TIME" value="2010-05-29TAF" mod="END">late Saturday afternoon</TIMEX3> , leaving the huge Macondo field deep beneath the sea floor once again free to pump at least half a million gallons of crude <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> into the gulf .
` ` I can say we tried .
But what I can also say is this scares everybody , the fact that we ca n't make this well stop flowing , or have n't succeeded in that so far , '' Doug Suttles , BP 's chief operating officer , said in a late - day news conference .
` ` There 's no silver bullet to stop this leak , '' Coast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry said .
The top kill -- a term most Americans had never heard until it became part of the new national vocabulary along with ` ` blowout preventer , '' ` ` containment dome '' and ` ` junk shot '' -- had been seen as the best hope for turning the oil spill into something finite in volume .
<TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> BP must fall back on a containment strategy in the near term , hoping to capture as much oil as possible .
Sitting on the sea floor and awaiting deployment is a new containment dome , what the company calls the Lower Marine Riser Package cap .
With robotic submarines , the company will sever the leaking , kinked riser pipe that emerges from the top of the blowout preventer , the five - story - tall contraption on top of the wellhead .
Then engineers will guide the LMRP cap onto the pipe .
The cap is fitted with a grommet designed to keep out seawater and prevent the formation of slushy methane hydrates that bedeviled an earlier containment dome effort .
The cap procedure will take <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P4D">four</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P7D">seven days</TIMEX3> , officials say .
` ` This operation should be able to capture most of the oil , '' Suttles said .
` ` I want to stress the word ` most , ' because it 's not a tight , mechanical seal . ''
After that , the company could place another blowout preventer on top of the existing one .
Meanwhile two drilling rigs at the surface continue to drill relief wells .
That 's a long - term strategy that requires engineers to hit a seven - inch target , the bottom of the leaking well , 31\/2 miles below the surface of the gulf .
The first of the two relief wells to hit the target will send a massive dose of cement to seal the leaking well .
That will not be until <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2010-08">August</TIMEX3> , BP predicts .
<TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2010-05-29">Saturday</TIMEX3> 's news was hardly a shock , given the doubts expressed by engineers and even by BP itself about whether it 's possible to kill a well 5,000 feet below the surface and accessible only with robotic vehicles .
But the gulf was still hoping for good news .
After BP executives began the top kill <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2010-05-26">Wednesday</TIMEX3> , chief executive Tony Hayward said the effort was proceeding as planned .
Then the national incident commander , Thad Allen , gave news media interviews <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2010-05-27">Thursday</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2010-05-28">Friday</TIMEX3> suggesting that the effort was going well .
As he put it , ` ` We 'll get this under control . ''
The well had other ideas .
It ceased to spew oil only when it was force - fed the drilling mud .
When the pumping stopped , the well returned to form , churning out oil and gas .
It was like hitting a Bozo punching dummy -- it goes down , then springs back up .
Though some might prefer the analogy of the slasher - movie villain who always comes back for the sequel .
` ` This well is evil , '' moaned energy analyst Byron King .
