Even after BP oil spill , fundraising events were hopping Lobbyists for BP hosted at least 53 fundraising parties for lawmakers and candidates in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent years</TIMEX3> -- four of them since the explosion and oil spill at a BP - run oil drilling rig in the Gulf of Mexico , according to a watchdog group 's analysis .
Lobbyists typically represent multiple clients , and it is unknown how many of the events were intended to advance BP 's interests .
The numbers are based on fundraiser data compiled by the Sunlight Foundation , which collects information from anonymous donors and lobbyist reports .
The list is incomplete , and it is possible the lobbyists held other fundraisers as well .
Nine of the 11 known fundraisers <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010">this year</TIMEX3> were hosted by lobbyist Tony Podesta or other lobbyists for his firm , the Podesta Group , who represent the company as well as many other interests .
Since the Deepwater Horizon rig 's explosion in the gulf on <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2011-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> , here are the fundraisers by lobbyists who represent BP : -- Paul Brathwaite and Cristina Antelo , who both lobby for the Podesta Group , were among numerous hosts for a <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-05-26">May 26</TIMEX3> party benefiting CHC - BOLD PAC , a PAC for the Congressional Hispanic Caucus .
-- Tim Glassco , also a lobbyist for the Podesta Group , was a host of a ` ` young professionals '' happy hour on <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-05-25">May 25</TIMEX3> for
Rep. Glenn Nye -LRB-
D - Va .
-RRB- .
-- Dan Meyer , a lobbyist for the Duberstein Group , was a host of an <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2010-04-29">April 29</TIMEX3> event for Carly Fiorina , who was seeking the GOP nomination for a California U.S. Senate seat .
-- Podesta and his wife , Heather , hosted an <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2010-04-28">April 28</TIMEX3> breakfast for Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz -LRB-
D - Fla -RRB- .
Other oil and gas concerns have raised cash for lawmakers , too , sometimes with uncomfortable timing .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2010-05-12">May 12</TIMEX3> , executives including BP 's chairman , Lamar McKay , Transocean chief executive Steve Newman and Halliburton 's Timothy Probert appeared before a hearing in the House Energy and Commerce Committee to discuss responsibility for their respective roles in the Deepwater Horizon spill .
<TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="PT1H">About an hour</TIMEX3> earlier , House Republicans had gathered a few blocks away for an ` ` oil and gas breakfast '' fundraiser with industry members to benefit Rep. Kevin Brady -LRB- R - Tex -RRB- .
David Donnelly , of the Campaign for Fair Elections , said he was n't surprised that fundraisers were held by the lobbyists of BP and other oil firms .
` ` The fundraising season in Washington never ends , even when there are disasters like in the Gulf Coast and when the economy crashes .
Members of Congress still have to look for money , '' Donnelly said .
Donnelly also expressed concern about campaign contributions to Rep. Joe Barton -LRB- R - Tex .
-RRB- , who apologized to the company <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2010-06-17">Thursday</TIMEX3> for what he said was a White House ` ` shakedown '' in pressing BP to set aside $ 20 billion to compensate victims of the spill .
Later in the day , GOP leaders demanded that Barton retract his apology and stress BP 's responsibility for the spill .
Barton , who was elected to Congress in <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="1984">1984</TIMEX3> , has received $ 27,000 in campaign contributions from BP and its affiliates and $ 1.4 million from the oil and gas industry as a whole , according to campaign finance records .
` ` It 's amazing that Rep. Barton would stand up for a multinational corporation that has wrecked the livelihoods of so many people along the Gulf Coast , '' Donnelly said .
` ` Comments like this make all Americans question whether Congress represents them or the special interests funding their campaigns . '' ''
