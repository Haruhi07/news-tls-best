In the race to control and kill the leaking oil well in the Gulf of Mexico before a tropical storm halts operations , BP is gambling that it can perform several complex technical maneuvers simultaneously .
The company plans to change caps on the gusher , a tricky task that could greatly improve the ability to capture the oil or perhaps even shut down the well -- but that would permit oil to flow unabated during the switch .
The company had planned to change the cap only after first connecting the well to a new ship at the site , the Helix Producer , which can siphon up to 25,000 barrels of oil <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> .
But with a window of calm weather forecast for <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-W28">the next week</TIMEX3> or so , BP has accelerated its plans , administration officials said <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-07-08">Thursday</TIMEX3> .
This burst of activity comes as a relief well is nearing the blown - out borehole .
BP and administration officials say that if the weather holds and all the technology works as planned , they could begin the process of permanently plugging the well within <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P2W">two weeks</TIMEX3> .
With so much about to happen at the blowout site , the Obama administration on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010-07-08">Thursday</TIMEX3> gave BP officials <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P1D">24 hours</TIMEX3> to provide a detailed description of what they will do in the weeks ahead and how they will do it .
In a letter to BP , National Incident Commander Thad Allen also asked for a series of backup plans to be put into effect if events took unpredicted turns .
` ` They have said to our people this is how they 'd like to proceed .
We have questions about that , so we 're asking a series of questions , making sure that everything has been carefully thought through before we move into agreeing to sort of a simultaneous process , '' said a senior administration official .
On another front , the administration was dealt a setback when an appeals court rejected its request to reinstate its moratorium on deep - water drilling .
With the break in the weather , BP and the administration appeared to be projecting conflicting views on how quickly the leak might finally be killed .
In interviews on <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2010-07-07">Wednesday</TIMEX3> , BP 's managing director , Bob Dudley , raised the possibility of success before <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-07" mod="END">the end of July</TIMEX3> .
` ` In a perfect world with no interruptions , it 's possible to be ready to stop the well between <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2010-07-20">July 20</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2010-07-27">July 27</TIMEX3> , '' Dudley told the Wall Street Journal .
But he also said that perfect case was ` ` unlikely '' because of the threat of hurricanes .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2010-07-08">Thursday</TIMEX3> , Allen pointedly stuck to the official government estimate that the leak will be plugged by mid - <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2009-08">August</TIMEX3> .
If the effort succeeded earlier , Allen said , ` ` we 'd all jump for joy . ''
He cautioned , however , that the oil could be flowing up several different pathways inside the 10 - inch steel casing , which has a seven - inch pipe inside it .
It is unknown whether the oil and gas are flowing inside those structures , in the space between them or both .
Consequently , the relief well will succeed only when its drill penetrates the right layer or layers .
` ` We ca n't bet on getting it the first time , '' he said .
Allen said the relief - well drill will be in place to penetrate the leaking borehole in seven to <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="P10D">10 days</TIMEX3> -- a time frame more precise than any given before .
The process of filling the hole with mud and then plugging it with concrete will take seven to <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DURATION" value="P10D">10 more days</TIMEX3> and , he said , might have to be done a number of times , depending on where in the well the oil and gas are flowing .
