<TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P1M">One month</TIMEX3> after the start of a massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico , federal officials said <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-05-20">Thursday</TIMEX3> that oil was gushing out of the ground faster than they had estimated -- and that it would be days before they had a firm handle on the rate .
Officials initially put the flow at 5,000 barrels <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> .
But on <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-05-20">Thursday</TIMEX3> , the oil company BP announced that it was collecting that amount through a tube inserted into a leaking pipe , and video from the seafloor showed oil still spewing from the pipe .
BP said oil was also leaking from a spot a few yards away .
` ` <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> , it 's time to get better information , '' said Coast Guard Adm.
Thad W. Allen , who is leading the federal response to the spill resulting from the explosion at the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig .
Allen said it might be <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="PXD">several days</TIMEX3> before scientists come up with a new estimate .
The government did not want to issue a new estimate and then have to revise it again , he said .
Allen repeated what Obama administration officials have said for days : that the size of the leak would not affect their cleanup efforts , which are geared to combat ` ` the worst - case scenario . ''
Also <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-05-20">Thursday</TIMEX3> , the heads of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Homeland Security told BP chief executive Tony Hayward in a letter that the company had ` ` fallen short '' of its promises to keep the public and the federal government informed about the spill .
` ` BP must make publicly available any data and other information related to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill that you have collected , '' EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano wrote .
They asked for the results of tests looking for traces of oil and dispersant chemicals in the waters of the gulf .
BP did not respond <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2010-05-20">Thursday</TIMEX3> to requests for comment about the letter .
Separately , the EPA told BP officials <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2010-05-19">Wednesday</TIMEX3> that the company had <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="P1D">24 hours</TIMEX3> to choose a less toxic form of chemical dispersant to break up the oil spill and must apply the new form of dispersant within <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="P3D">72 hours</TIMEX3> of submitting the list of options .
The move suggests that federal officials are concerned that the unprecedented use of dispersants could pose a significant threat to the Gulf of Mexico 's marine life .
BP has been using two forms of dispersants , Corexit 9500A and Corexit 9527A , and so far has applied 600,000 gallons on the surface and 55,000 underwater .
A spokesman for Rep. Jerrold Nadler -LRB- D - N.Y. -RRB- said that on <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2010-05-20">Thursday</TIMEX3> , BP ordered 60,000 gallons of Dispersit -- a less toxic dispersant preferred by many environmentalists and lawmakers .
