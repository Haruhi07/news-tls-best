Reuters -RRB- - Internships in the civil service and business should be offered as widely as possible to boost social mobility and stop them being monopolised by well - connected families , Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2011-04-05">Tuesday</TIMEX3> .
In many professions , a period as an intern can greatly increase an applicant 's chances of winning a permanent job .
However , the government is concerned that such openings are often unadvertised and end up being offered to the children and friends of existing employees , restricting the diversity of the intake .
` ` For too long , internships have been the almost exclusive preserve of the sharp - elbowed and the well - connected , '' Clegg said as he launched the 11 - month - old coalition 's social mobility strategy .
` ` Unfair , informal internships can rig the market in favor of those who already have opportunities .
A country that is socially mobile bases opportunity on your ability and drive , not on who your father 's friends are , '' he added .
The government has pledged to improve social mobility , which it says fell under the 13 - year administration of Labor .
As part of the strategy , the civil service will end the practice of informal internships by <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2012">2012</TIMEX3> .
Instead , all government department internships will be advertised on a central website .
Several companies have also signed a ` ` Business Compact , '' committing them to ensure their internship schemes reach a wide audience , including Channel 4 television , The Guardian newspaper , and consultants KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers .
