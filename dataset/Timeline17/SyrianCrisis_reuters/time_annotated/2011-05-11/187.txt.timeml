Reuters -RRB- - Syrian activists are losing hope that pro - democracy protests will topple the 11 - year rule of President Bashar al - Assad and fear that his use of force against protesters may crush the movement .
Activists from inside and outside Syria said a fragmented opposition had failed to build on street demonstrations which broke out <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2011-W12">seven weeks ago</TIMEX3> demanding greater freedoms , missing a fleeting opportunity to press for reforms from the Baath party led by the Assad family for <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P4DE">the past four decades</TIMEX3> .
` ` The forces on the ground can not topple the regime ...
They have lost a golden and rare opportunity to do something , '' said Abdul Karim - Rihawi , head of the Human Rights League in Damascus .
` ` The protests will continue but will not grow in popularity , '' he said , adding that Assad might deploy even greater force to crush them if necessary .
Under the rule of Assad 's father , Hafez , Syrian forces razed the old quarter of the city of Hama in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="1982">1982</TIMEX3> to end an uprising led by the Muslim Brotherhood .
Up to 30,000 people were killed .
` ` If , God forbid , the regime crushes the protests then I think it will take us <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="P50Y">50 years</TIMEX3> before we move again , '' said another Syrian activist who lives in exile .
Analysts say that the unrest may not topple Assad but has definitely shaken his rule .
Bouthaina Shaaban , an adviser to Assad , said <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2011-W19" mod="START">earlier this week</TIMEX3> that the government had gained the upper hand over the revolt and that Assad 's rule had passed its ` ` dangerous moment '' .
The downbeat comments from some activists , which contrast with statements from others who say Assad 's use of force will only increase protesters ' determination , reflect frustration at the inability to rally the same numbers as the Egyptian uprising which toppled Hosni Mubarak , or to agree a political manifesto .
The opposition includes secularists , Islamists and ethnic Kurds , in exile and in Syria .
Some seek Assad 's downfall and others want more freedoms and reform of the autocratic system .
That has made it difficult to unify demands on the back of protests driven more by street anger than activists ' agendas .
` ` The opposition has failed to even form a council to lead and guide the protesters .
This has left each city on its own and <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> is being crushed .
They finished Deraa and <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> Banias and Homs then will move to another one , '' the exile activist said .
Rihawi said so far no more than 200,000 Syrians had taken to the streets , from a population of 20 million .
As well as Assad 's use of force , some activists said fears of chaos if Assad were to be toppled and concerns that some protesters were driven by sectarian motives could have dissuaded some people from demonstrating .
` ` We are <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> convinced that there are Islamists working from within the protesters .
They are only 5 percent
but they are causing damage , '' one secular activist said .
` ` We want democracy in Syria , but not a democracy to unleash sectarianism . ''
Syrian authorities have blamed Sunni Muslim Islamist groups for the unrest , which so far has claimed the lives of more than 600 civilians and 120 soldiers and policemen .
Citing chants by some crowds against Assad 's minority Alawite sect , as well as against Syria 's Christian community , another activist said : ` ` It is clear <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> that they have Islamist background . ''
Alawites , an offshoot of Shi'ite Islam , and Christians fear their freedoms of religion would end if Sunni Islamists came to power in place of Assad 's secular Baath party .
` ` I am a Sunni , but I do not want the hardliners to rule us , '' said one of the activists , adding that some Sunni mosques had urged a ` ` greater Jihad '' , an Islamist rallying call .
Syria , which opposed the U.S. invasion of Iraq that toppled fellow Baathist Saddam Hussein in <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2003">2003</TIMEX3> , turned a blind eye to Islamist militants using its land to cross into Iraq to fight U.S. forces in the years that followed the war .
Some of these violent Islamists stayed in Syria , activists noted .
` ` My fear is that they gave the regime the motive to use force , '' one of the opposition organizers said .
Activists said the country 's nightmare would be a split within the army , whose top commanders are mainly from the Alawite minority .
That could unleash sectarian tension and push the majority Sunni country into sectarian conflict similar to neighboring Lebanon 's <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="1975">1975</TIMEX3> - <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="1990">90</TIMEX3> civil war , or to Iraq 's turmoil .
` ` A division in the army definitely means that Syria will be divided ... because a split on a sectarian basis means each sect will be fighting for survival , '' said a rights activist in Syria .
Reports have surfaced of some low - level defections within the army , but officials and some activists dismissed it .
Assad 's initial response to the protests included steps toward reforms , including granting citizenship to some ethnic Kurds and lifting a 48 - year - old state of emergency .
But as demonstrations continued , he turned to the army <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2011-W17">two weeks ago</TIMEX3> to crush resistance .
` ` There are many people in the street who believe that Bashar is a reformist and <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> the protests are delaying him from achieving the reforms , '' Rihawi said , adding that Assad still retained popularity .
Other activists said that even though he could deploy overwhelming force , the 45 - year - old president would still have to frame a political answer to the country 's crisis : ` ` The security solution is not in the interest of the regime , '' one said .
` ` They have to resort to a political solution -- the result of the security solution is zero '' .
