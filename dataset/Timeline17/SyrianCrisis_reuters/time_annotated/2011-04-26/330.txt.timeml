ISTANBUL | Tue <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-04-26">Apr 26 , 2011</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2011-04-26T13:54">1:54 pm</TIMEX3> EDT ISTANBUL -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Members of the Syrian opposition meeting in Istanbul on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-04-26">Tuesday</TIMEX3> pleaded for international help to persuade President Bashar al - Assad to halt a brutal crackdown on a popular revolt .
` ` Our friends in the West , in Turkey , in the Arab world , if they want to help us , then they can do that by ... putting the clearest possible pressure on the Syrian regime to stop targeting civilians , '' Anas Abdah , the British - based chairman of the Movement for Justice and Development , told Reuters .
Abdah was speaking on the sidelines of a gathering of opposition and rights groups organised by Turkish non - government organizations to highlight the Syrian people 's plight .
Hundreds have been killed by Syrian security forces since pro - democracy protests began <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011-W11">six weeks ago</TIMEX3> .
The violence intensified in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent days</TIMEX3> with an assault on Deraa , the heart of the uprising , but opposition members living in exile took heart from reports of dissent within the army .
` ` It looks like Bashar al - Assad has taken a strategic decision to crush a non - violent movement in Syria by ordering his brother Maher al - Assad ... to go and storm Deraa city , '' Abdah said .
Maher , regarded as the second most powerful man in Syria , commands the ultra - loyal Fourth Division -- the Syrian Army 's equivalent of special forces .
Abdah said he had reports that some army officers from another division , from captains to a lieutenant - general , were trying to stop the Fourth Division from entering the city .
` ` At this moment of time we have reports that certain elements in the Fifth Division are not responding in the way Bashar and Maher want them to , and are siding with the people , '' Abdah said .
The Fifth Division is stationed in the south of Syria , on a plain overlooked by the Israeli - occupied Golan Heights , and its ranks are filled with Sunni Muslims .
Syria has been dominated for <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P5DE" mod="LESS_THAN">nearly five decades</TIMEX3> by an Alawite minority close to Shi'a Islam , and the army 's officer corps is dominated by Alawites , though its ranks are mostly Sunni .
` ` The Syrian army is a national army .
They will stand by the people eventually , '' said Rabhan Ramadan , an Austrian - based Syrian Kurd working with the Haitan Maleh Foundation , a rights group in Brussels .
` ` <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Right now</TIMEX3> we are beginning to see some members of the military refusing to shoot .
It is just the beginning , but we expect to see more of that , '' he added .
Abdah said he was in Istanbul as a representative of signatories of the <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2005">2005</TIMEX3> Damascus Declaration , which has become an umbrella group for the Syrian opposition and has a program for political and economic reform .
` ` However at this moment in time all of this is irrelevant and meaningless if targeting of civilians were to continue by the Syrian regime , '' he said .
Turkey 's President Tayyip Erdogan , who has had friendly relations with Assad , has urged Assad to refrain from using excessive force and to undertake reforms his people are seeking .
The United States is considering targeted sanctions against Assad 's government and on <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2011-04-25">Monday</TIMEX3> , President Barack Obama conferred with Erdogan about the turmoil .
Syrian human rights organization Sawasiah has estimated at least 400 people have been killed since the uprising began .
Walid Saffour , the London - based president of the Syrian Human Rights Committee , put the toll at more than 700 , and added that 5,000 people had been arrested .
Syria has expelled most foreign journalists , and getting independent corroboration of casualties is impossible .
Saffour said he had reports of at least one soldier being executed for refusing to fire on civilians in Deraa , and spoke of some officers and soldiers fleeing to Jordan to seek asylum .
` ` The situation is very , very horrific , '' Saffour said .
