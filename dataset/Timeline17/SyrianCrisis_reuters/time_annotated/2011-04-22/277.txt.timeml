SHARM EL - SHEIKH , Egypt | Fri <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011-04-22">Apr 22 , 2011</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="TIME" value="2011-04-22T17:15">5:15 pm</TIMEX3> BST SHARM EL - SHEIKH , Egypt -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Hotel worker Meena George rejoiced when a popular revolt ousted Egypt 's autocratic president , but since the tourists have stopped coming , his joy has given way to fear and desperation .
George was made redundant by his employers at the Red Sea resort of Sharm el - Sheikh , and has resorted to borrowing more and more money from his friends to survive .
` ` The revolution is good , but painful , '' said George , 33 .
` ` Many of my friends have fallen on hard times as we get laid off , because business is slow . ''
From the Pyramids of Giza to the Red Sea resorts , tourist numbers have plummeted to just a trickle , dealing a devastating blow to the millions of Egyptians whose livelihoods depend on the 14 million or so visitors who once thronged to the country .
At the height of the 18 - day uprising that ousted president Hosni Mubarak , embassies issued travel warnings and many tour groups canceled their trips , throwing an industry that is a major source of foreign currency into crisis .
<TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2011-06">Two months later</TIMEX3> , the chaos has largely subsided , the police who deserted their posts during protests are mostly back on the job and the travel warnings have been eased .

But the tourists have yet to return , and Egypt 's tourism minister has forecast the industry 's <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3> revenue will be 25 percent lower than <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2010">the previous year</TIMEX3> .
` ` I can hardly recall a single tourist coming into my shop <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> , '' said Omar Mohamed Saed , the 59 - year - old owner of a store selling copper goods in Khan el - Khalili , the main bazaar in Islamic Cairo .
` ` The uprising killed us . ''
Saed was already struggling before the uprising as the number of Western tourists declined due to the global economic downturn .
He said the most he had made in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="P1D">one day</TIMEX3> since the protests was 1,000 Egyptian pounds -LRB- 101.72 pounds -RRB- , adding he had asked his employees to work fewer days so he could afford to pay them .
Four families live off the income from Ahmed Salamah 's Cairo souvenir shop .
He says he is struggling to feed his own wife and three children from his <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> meager income .
` ` I have sold nothing since the revolution started , '' said Salamah , 36 .
` ` All day I sit in the shop and watch TV . ''
At the Giza Pyramids , the country 's most popular attraction and a must - see destination for visitors to Cairo , not one Western tourist could be seen as the sun set on a weekday in <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2011-04">April</TIMEX3> , one of the prime months of the year for holidaymakers .
With fewer potential customers , the street vendors and rogue guides that typically hover near Egypt 's famous landmarks seem to be preying more aggressively on tourist wallets .
A party of German and French tourists visiting the Pyramids <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> said tourist police looked on as a gaggle of touts followed them around the site competing for their attention .
` ` One thrust an opened can of drink into my hand and demanded I pay for it , '' said German tourist Alex .
As the scorching <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2011-SU">summer</TIMEX3> approaches , tourism officials are hoping for a pick - up in business from <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2011-09">September</TIMEX3> .
But that depends on the security situation , said Brigadier Mohammad Al - Mogati , the Arab League 's assistant for tourism security .
Political unrest has waned , but army vehicles can still be see on some streets and embassies are <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> warning citizens against an increase in muggings , robberies and racketeering in Egypt .
War is also raging in neighboring Libya .
In Sharm , which hardly saw a whiff of the protests that shook the capital and other cities , glum - faced souvenir merchants idle outside empty shops along an almost deserted walkway at Naama Bay and in the Old Town market .
Security has been tight at Egypt 's busiest Red Sea resort since a series of bombings by Islamist militants in <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2005">2005</TIMEX3> killed over 80 people , most of them Egyptians , and wounded hundreds .
Police and security guards patrol resorts , using metal detectors and airport - style x - ray machines to search those entering .
Mubarak , who turned the town into a major tourist attraction , is <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> in Sharm 's hospital .
Some residents say his presence in the resort had become a liability .
` ` Tourists come to Sharm to have a good time , '' said Galal Shabaan , a 33 - year - old shop owner .
` ` You ca n't relax with Mubarak around and the spectre of protests hanging over Sharm . ''
Despite an increasingly grim picture , Hala el - Khatib , secretary general of the Egyptian Hotels Association , said nationwide , hotel occupancy was only down by 15 percent in <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2011-04">April</TIMEX3> compared to <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2011-04">the same month</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2010-04">a year ago</TIMEX3> .
She said hotel occupancy in Sharm had recovered to 32 percent by mid - <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2011-04">April</TIMEX3> from an abysmal 11 percent after the protests erupted on <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="2011-01-25">January 25</TIMEX3> .

But it was still a far cry from the 75 percent rate hotels in the resort are accustomed to at this time of year .
Still , Khatib remains optimistic , and says landmarks of the revolution such as Cairo 's Tahrir Square , which became internationally renowned as the gathering place of the protests , are featuring on some tourist itineraries .
` ` Security is getting better day by day .
People have a different view of Egypt , they have a more positive view .
They want to include Tahrir in their program , '' she said .
