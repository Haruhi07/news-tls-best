Reuters -RRB- - Syrian security forces killed almost 90 protesters <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-04-22">Friday</TIMEX3> , rights activists said , the bloodiest day in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P1M">a month</TIMEX3> of escalating pro - democracy demonstrations against the rule of President Bashar al - Assad .

The Local Coordination Committees sent Reuters a list with the names of 88 people , classified by region , the group said were killed in areas stretching from the port city of Latakia to Homs , Hama , Damascus and the southern village of Izra'a .
It was not possible to independently confirm the figures .
U.S. President Barack Obama condemned the violence and accused Assad of seeking help from Iran .
` ` This outrageous use of violence to quell protests must come to an end <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> , '' Obama said in a statement .
` ` Instead of listening to their own people , President Assad is blaming outsiders while seeking Iranian assistance in repressing Syria 's citizens through the same brutal tactics that have been used by his Iranian allies . ''
That was an apparent reference to the suppression of anti - government protests in Iran , the biggest since the <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="1979">1979</TIMEX3> Islamic revolution , that erupted after a disputed <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3> presidential election .
Tens of thousands of people had taken to the streets of cities across Syria in the biggest demonstrations to sweep the country so far , and called for the ` ` overthrow of the regime . ''
That reflected the hardening of demands which initially focused on reforms and greater freedoms .
The protests went ahead despite Assad 's lifting of the state of emergency the day before .
Ending the hated emergency rule , in place since the Baath Party seized power <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="1963">48 years ago</TIMEX3> , was a central demand of demonstrators , who also seek the release of political prisoners and dismantling of the security services .
` ` This was the first test of the seriousness of authorities -LRB- toward reform -RRB-
and they have failed , '' activist Ammar Qurabi said .
Washington urged Syria to stop the violence against protesters and British Foreign Secretary William Hague said emergency law should be ` ` lifted in practice not just in word . ''
<TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2011-04-22">Friday</TIMEX3> 's violence brings the death toll to about 300 , according to rights activists , since the unrest which broke out on <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2011-03-18">March 18</TIMEX3> in the southern city of Deraa .
Activists cited the highest toll in the nearby village of Izra'a where protesters had been trying to head for Deraa .
Residents said 14 people were killed .
` ` Izra'a is in the dark .
No mobile phones or landlines working .
People have been talking from villages near to Izra'a but not in the town , '' said Wissam Tarif of human rights organization , Insan .
Syrian television said eight people were killed and 28 wounded , including army personnel , in attacks by armed groups in the village .
It added an armed group had attacked a military base in the Damascus suburb of Muadhamiya .
Amnesty International said it had been told of 75 deaths , including two children and a 70 - year - old man .
Malcolm Smart , Amnesty International 's Middle East and North Africa director , urged the authorities to stop the violence : ` ` They must also immediately launch an independent investigation into what happened and ensure that any security forces found to have carried out these killings are brought to justice . ''
As in the Tunisian and Egyptian uprisings , citizens are rebelling against both a lack of freedom and opportunity and security forces ' impunity and corruption that has enriched the elite while one - third of Syrians live below the poverty line .
In the first joint statement since the protests broke out , the activists coordinating the demonstrations <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2011-04-22">Friday</TIMEX3> demanded the abolition of the Baath Party monopoly on power and the establishment of a democratic political system .
Aided by his family and a pervasive security apparatus , Assad , 45 , has absolute power in Syria .
Protests swept the country of 20 million people , from the Mediterranean city of Banias to the eastern towns of Deir al - Zor and Qamishli .
In Damascus , security forces fired teargas to disperse 2,000 protesters in the district of Midan .
In Hama , where Assad 's father crushed an armed Islamist revolt in <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="1982">1982</TIMEX3> , a witness said security forces opened fire to prevent protesters reaching the Baath Party headquarters .
` ` We saw two snipers on the building .
None of us had weapons .
There are casualties , possibly two dead , '' said the witness .
Syria 's third city Homs , where security forces had killed 21 protesters <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2011-W16">this week</TIMEX3> when demonstrators tried to gather at a main square , was not spared <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2011-04-22">Friday</TIMEX3> either .
` ` I was in the center of Homs and in front of me I heard a security commander telling his armed men : ` Do n't spare them -LRB- protesters
-RRB- , ' '' rights campaigner Najati Tayara told Reuters .
Witnesses said security forces also shot at protesters in the Damascus district of Barzeh and the suburb of Douma .
Al Jazeera showed footage of three corpses , wrapped in white burial shrouds , which it said were from the eastern Damascus suburb of Zamalka .
Ahead of the main weekly prayers <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2011-04-22">Friday</TIMEX3> , which have often turned out to be launch pads for major demonstrations , the army deployed in Homs and police put up checkpoints across Damascus , apparently trying to prevent protests sweeping in from suburbs .
After prayers finished in Deraa , several thousand protesters gathered chanting anti - Assad slogans .
` ` The Syrian people will not be subjugated .
Go away doctor -LRB- Assad -RRB- .
We will trample on you and your slaughterous regime , '' they shouted .
Assad 's conciliatory move to lift the state of emergency followed a familiar pattern since the unrest began <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2011-03">a month ago</TIMEX3> : pledges of reform are made before <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2011-04-22">Friday</TIMEX3> when demonstrations are the strongest , usually followed by an intense crackdown .
Activists said some funerals for those killed <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2011-04-22">Friday</TIMEX3> took place in Damascus suburbs in the evening .
Funerals have been another platform for protesters in <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent weeks</TIMEX3> and security forces have opened fire when mourners started demonstrating .
The authorities have blamed armed groups , infiltrators and Sunni Muslim militant organizations for provoking violence at demonstrations by firing on civilians and security forces .
Western and other Arab countries have mostly muted their criticism of the killings in Syria for fear of destabilizing the country , which plays a strategic role in many of the conflicts in the Middle East .
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters .
They want the nation broken into cultural enclaves protected by small militias .
National boundaries in North Africa have got to go , they are a stranglehold on multi - cultural needs .
The Bathist party is among the most ruthless in history and this al - assad junior is no better than his father .
They try to mask their identities with degrees and overseas educations , but unfortunately , you can take them out of the gutter but you ca nt take the gutter out of them .
Even more sad in the region is that without these ruthless dictators , you would have complete anarchy in the streets .
Too many different sects\/tribes and interests .
Everyone in the region is worried about their personal benefit first and not that of the common good .
The Middle East is a hopeless cause and the sooner we pull out the more we can focus on our own problems here .
Taking out these monkeys will only create larger struggles for power which will lead to more dictators and more bloodshed .
Just let these people alone and if they kill themselves , than that is their chosen fate .

The Arab <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="2011-SP">Spring</TIMEX3> to democracy must be worrying to Israel which depends on Arab tyrannies and the anti - Israel threat they pose militarily to keep Israel from descending into civil war .
Without enemies that is almost certain to happen in Israel , especially if the Arab <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="2011-SP">Spring</TIMEX3> Democracy Movement also gains hold and wins in the Palestinian territories , leaving only Iran as the big threat unless democracy also takes control in Persia .
With that scenario in mind , I wonder what plans the United States has in place to deal with a potential new reality which will see its allied countries like Saudi Arabia and other oil producing sheikdoms the only major anti - democratic and anti - Israel tyrannies left in the region .
The next six to 36 - months may reshape everything including Israel and the way it governs itself .
