Reuters -RRB- - China will boost its coastal forces by adding ships and 6,000 personnel by <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2020">2020</TIMEX3> , state media said on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2011-06-17">Friday</TIMEX3> , a move likely to raise tensions with neighbors staking rival claims to waters thought to hold vast reserves of oil and gas .
The expansion of the China Maritime Surveillance -LRB- CMS -RRB- forces , a paramilitary law enforcement agency that patrols China 's territorial waters , was unveiled <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P2D">two days</TIMEX3> after the country sent its largest civilian maritime patrol ship to the South China Sea .
The moves show Beijing 's resolve to protect its ` ` maritime rights and sovereignty '' which it says have been increasingly violated amid a rising frequency of disputes , but other claimants are also keen to show they are not backing down .
The Philippines has sent its largest warship -- a Second World War - vintage destroyer escort -- on a patrol that would take it through the disputed Scarborough Shoals in the South China Sea , off its main island of Luzon .
` ` The navy conducts regular offshore patrols and we should not connect the deployment of Rajah Humabon to the deployment of China 's maritime vessel , '' said Eduardo Batac , spokesman for the Philippine Defense Department .
Foreign Affairs Secretary Albert del Rosario met diplomats from the nine other Association of South East Asian Nations states in Manila , urging a common position and approach to resolve the South China Sea dispute .
China 's maritime forces , under the State Oceanic Administration , will have 16 aircraft and 350 vessels by the end of the country 's five - year plan ending in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3> , and more than 15,000 personnel and 520 vessels by <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2020">2020</TIMEX3> , the official China Daily said citing an unnamed senior official .
It did not give a price tag .
` ` There have been an increasing number of intrusions by foreign vessels and planes into Chinese waters and airspace in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent years</TIMEX3> , '' the newspaper said .
It said that the coastal forces had logged 1,303 foreign ships and 214 planes intruding in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3> , compared with a total of 110 cases in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2007">2007</TIMEX3> .
Tensions in the South China Sea have risen in <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2011-05">the past month</TIMEX3> on concerns that China is becoming more assertive in the waters , parts of which are also claimed by Brunei , Malaysia , the Philippines , Taiwan and Vietnam .
A commentary from China 's official Xinhua news agency blamed the tension solely on United States wading into the dispute .

The United States ' statements had emboldened China 's neighbors , ` ` and only then did they dare adopt a ultra - hawkish stance in voicing their positions , '' the commentary said .
China 's claim is by far the largest , forming a large U - shape over most of the sea 's 648,000 square miles -LRB- 1.7 million square km -RRB- , including the Spratly and Paracel archipelagos .
<TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2011-W24">This week</TIMEX3> , Beijing warned outside countries not to step into the dispute , after Vietnam said other countries , including the United States , could help defuse the tension .
China has accused Vietnam of violating its claim to the Spratlys and nearby seas , which Vietnam also deems its own .
China calls the islands the Nansha group .
Beijing said <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2011-W23">last week</TIMEX3> it would hold naval drills in <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2011-06">June</TIMEX3> in the western Pacific Ocean and the navy plans to launch its first aircraft carrier as early as <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2011">this year</TIMEX3> .
The maritime forces have grown rapidly since Liu Cigui , 55 , took over as head of the State Oceanic Administration <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2011-03">last March</TIMEX3> after a stint as mayor of the southeastern city of Xiamen .
Liu , head of Fujian 's provincial oceanic and fishery bureau from <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2000">2000</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2002">2002</TIMEX3> , is no stranger to maritime matters .
` ` Liu Cigui decided to beef up China Maritime Surveillance by adding ships and helicopters to its South Sea , East Sea and North Sea fleets '' to safeguard territorial waters and the country 's marine economy , a source with ties to the Oceanic Administration told Reuters .
Liu put the output of China 's marine economy at 3.8 trillion yuan $ 586.8 billion -LRB- 363 billion pounds -RRB- in <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3> , accounting for 9.7 percent of gross domestic output .
He did not give a comparative figure .
Maritime surveillance personnel are mainly retired navy men and officers , the source said , requesting anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to reporters .
China Maritime Surveillance was founded in <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="1998">1998</TIMEX3> , and its duties include protecting the maritime environment .
China has 32,000 km -LRB- 20,000 miles -RRB- and 350,000 square km -LRB- 135,000 square miles -RRB- of territorial waters and internal waters , according to state news agency Xinhua .
Xinhua said China 's maritime forces remain ` ` weak '' given the country 's large sea territory .
