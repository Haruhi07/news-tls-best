LOS ANGELES -LRB-
Reuters -RRB- - Fast - food chain Jack in the Box has pulled toys from its kids ' meals , a spokesman told Reuters on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-06-21">Tuesday</TIMEX3> .
The move , which managers at Los Angeles outlets said took effect on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011-06-16">Thursday</TIMEX3> , comes as fast - food companies are under pressure to stop using toys to market children 's meals that are high in calories , sugar , fat and salt .
Lawmakers in San Francisco and nearby Santa Clara County have passed laws that will require kids ' meals to meet certain nutritional standards before they can be sold with toys .
` ` While we ' ve been aware of efforts to ban the inclusion of toys in kids ' meals , that did not drive our decision , '' Jack in the Box spokesman Brian Luscomb said .
` ` Our advertising and promotions have focused exclusively on the frequent fast - food customer , not children , '' added Randy Carmical , also a Jack in the Box spokesman .
Carmical said the San Diego - based company has been more focused on the food in its meals for children , such as grilled cheese sandwiches or grilled chicken strips .
The company pulled toys from the meals when it began offering parents the option of substituting sliced apples with caramel sauce as an alternative to French fries , he said .
` ` We believe that providing these kinds of options is more appealing to a parent than packaging a toy with lower - quality fare , '' Carmical said .
The Jack in the Box decision won praise from organizations and advocates critical of the fast - food industry .
` ` It 's terrific that Jack in the Box has taken this step , '' said Margo Wootan , nutrition policy director at the Center for Science in the Public Interest .
` ` It 's really a monumental step that I hope their competitors will emulate . ''
CSPI in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-12">December</TIMEX3> sued McDonald 's Corp , the world 's largest hamburger chain , to stop it from using Happy Meal toys to lure children into its restaurants .
Consumer and health advocates are using the announcement to put pressure on McDonalds , Burger King , Taco Bell and other fast food chains that still include toys in kids ' meals .
Lobbyists for fast - food companies are fighting anti - obesity laws by asking U.S. state legislators to remove restaurant marketing from local governments ' regulatory menu .
Toy giveaways make up more than half of the marketing expenditures in the fast - food industry , according to Wootan , with $ 360 million spent <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="SET" value="XXXX">annually</TIMEX3> to put toys in kids meals .
Jack in the Box has about 2,200 restaurants across the United States , where it is the fifth - largest hamburger chain .
