At least 30 people were killed at <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2011-W28-WE">the weekend</TIMEX3> in clashes between residents in Homs , a rights group said , in the first factional fighting since protests against Syrian President Bashar al - Assad erupted in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2011-03">March</TIMEX3> .
Rami Abdelrahman , head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights , said on <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2011-07-18">Monday</TIMEX3> that clashes between pro- and anti - Assad residents started on <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2011-07-16">Saturday</TIMEX3> after the bodies of kidnapped Assad supporters were returned to their relatives dismembered .
Homs has been a focal point of the uprising since the military stormed it <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2011-05">two months ago</TIMEX3> to try to crush street protests calling for Assad to quit after <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="P11Y">11 years</TIMEX3> in power .
The central city is a microcosm of Syria 's religious schism with a Sunni Muslim majority living alongside minority groups , including Christians and Alawite Muslims , Assad 's own sect .
` ` At least 30 civilians were killed ...
they fell after civil fighting between pro- and anti - regime -LRB- residents -RRB- started on <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2011-07-16">Saturday</TIMEX3> , '' the Observatory said in statement .
` ` These clashes are a dangerous development that undermines the revolution and serves the interests of its enemies who want to turn it into a civil war , '' he said .
Mohamad Saleh , an activist and a resident of Homs , said the there was no more fighting on <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2011-07-18">Monday</TIMEX3> but residents were tense .
He said a group of Alawite men , including four policemen , went missing on <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2011-07-14">Thursday</TIMEX3> .
The bodies of four of them were found on <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2011-07-16">Saturday</TIMEX3> with their eyes gouged out .
Six more were found on <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2011-07-17">Sunday</TIMEX3> .
` ` Immediately some people from their neighborhood -LRB- in the Alawite area -RRB- went to the street and torched , robbed and destroyed at least 12 shops belonging to Sunnis , '' he told Reuters by telephone .
` ` The security forces were watching and did not do anything .
Then shooting started
and we did not know where it was coming from and people started dying from both sides . ''
Saleh said that residents of Homs blame Sunni and Alawite ` ` thugs '' for the violence .
` ` This is very dangerous , we are trying to calm things down .
Nobody in Homs accepts this , the people do not want these -LRB- sectarian -RRB- divisions , '' he said .
The anti - Assad protests started in Syria 's poorer Sunni rural areas , but quickly spread to cities which have more of a sectarian mix .
At least 1,400 civilians have been killed since the uprising began , human rights organizations say .
Syrian authorities blame armed groups with Islamist links for the violence and say at least 500 policemen and soldiers have been killed since <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2011-03">March</TIMEX3> .
