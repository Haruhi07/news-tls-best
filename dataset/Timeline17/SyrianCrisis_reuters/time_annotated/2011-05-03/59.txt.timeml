-LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Deeply divided Lebanon , with no government since <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-01">January</TIMEX3> , <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> faces extra risks from instability in its powerful neighbor Syria , where President Bashar al - Assad is staging a violent crackdown on pro - democracy protesters .
The domestic political crisis and the spillover effects of the turmoil in Syria are damaging the Lebanese economy , expected to grow only 2.5 percent <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2011">this year</TIMEX3> , down from 7.5 percent in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3> , according to the International Monetary Fund .
Any conflict in Sunni - majority Syria , where Assad 's minority Alawites have long held a disproportionate share of power , could fuel political and sectarian tensions in Lebanon , as well as disrupting trade , tourism and capital inflows .
Also hanging over Lebanon are possible indictments by a U.N.-backed special tribunal of Hezbollah members in the <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2005">2005</TIMEX3> assassination of Lebanese ex - Prime Minister Rafik al - Hariri .
Here are some of the key risks to watch : A political alliance dominated by Hezbollah , an armed Shi'ite Islamist movement backed by Syria and Iran , toppled the previous government led by Saad al - Hariri over his refusal to cut links with the tribunal seeking to try his father 's killers .
Najib Mikati , a Sunni , was designated prime minister on <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2011-01-25">Jan. 25</TIMEX3> .
But disputes over cabinet posts involving Hezbollah and its Shi'ite and Christian allies , as well as President Michel Suleiman , have blocked his efforts to form a government .
One of the knottiest problems pits Suleiman against Michel Aoun , leader of the biggest Christian bloc in parliament , who wants to name the next interior minister as part of his share of cabinet posts .
Suleiman insists on keeping his nominee , Ziad Baroud , in the job , whose mandate includes organising elections .
Mikati has yet to disclose how he would deal with the Hariri tribunal , which is <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> revising secret indictments issued in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2011-01">January</TIMEX3> .
It is not clear when they will be made public .
Hezbollah , which denies any role in Hariri 's killing , wants the next government to withdraw funding and Lebanese judges from the ` ` politically motivated '' court based in The Hague .
Enjoying Saudi and U.S. support , Saad al - Hariri , the main political voice of Lebanon 's Sunni community , has become more outspoken in support of the tribunal since his government fell .
Israel , which fought a 34 - day war with Hezbollah in <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2006">2006</TIMEX3> , has said it will target all of Lebanon in any new conflict because of the Shi'ite group 's growing clout in government .
The upheaval across the Arab world has shoved Lebanon 's problems out of the limelight .
No foreign mediators have stepped in since joint Saudi - Syrian mediation collapsed <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2010" mod="END">late last year</TIMEX3> .
\ * Publication of indictments by special tribunal Lebanon 's stability has long depended on Syria , which wields influence via Hezbollah and other local allies , even though it was forced to end a 29 - year military presence in <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2005">2005</TIMEX3> .
The challenge to Assad family rule in Damascus is another complicating factor in Lebanon 's already intricate politics .
It may energise anti - Syrian Lebanese factions , or spur Hezbollah to tighten its own grip if it feels its Syrian ally is weakening .
Syria could easily stir strife in Lebanon , still recovering from its <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="1975">1975</TIMEX3> - <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="1990">90</TIMEX3> civil war , if it wanted to .
It blames the unrest in Syria on Islamist groups and has accused pro - Hariri politicians of inciting and arming anti - Assad protesters .
Turmoil in Syria is already spilling over the border .
Some Syrian dissidents , including a prominent blogger , are <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> in Lebanon .
Hundreds of Syrians fled into northern Lebanon on <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2011-04-28">April 28</TIMEX3> after gunfire erupted on the Syrian side of the border .
The instability in Syria , Lebanon 's only overland outlet , has also disrupted transport and trade .
The prolonged political uncertainty in Lebanon , <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> coupled with turmoil in Syria and elsewhere , is taking its toll on an economy badly in need of reform and infrastructure investment .
Apart from lower growth , the IMF report also forecast that inflation would rise to 6.5 percent from 4.5 percent in <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3> and that the fiscal deficit would widen to 10.5 percent of Gross Domestic Product -LRB- GDP -RRB- from 7.2 percent <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="2010">last year</TIMEX3> .
The Central Bank has ample foreign reserves of $ 31 billion to help keep the Lebanese pound LBP =
stable .
But after <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DURATION" value="P3Y">three years</TIMEX3> of impressive GDP growth , warning signs are flashing .
Caretaker Finance Minister Raya al - Hassan said on <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DATE" value="2011-04-28">April 28</TIMEX3> that activity in all sectors , including tourism , real estate and retail , was down .
A capital outflow of about 1 percent of bank deposits had occurred in <TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="DATE" value="2011-01">January</TIMEX3> , when political tension spiked .
Many depositors have switched into dollars , despite higher interest rates offered on the Lebanese pound , prompting banks to conserve their local currency holdings , rather than buying the treasury bills on which government financing relies .
Lebanon 's public debt is expected to rise to $ 55 billion in <TIMEX3 tid="t36" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3> from $ 51 billion in <TIMEX3 tid="t37" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3> .
Analysts say it could hit $ 65 billion in the next <TIMEX3 tid="t42" type="DURATION" value="P3Y">three</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t41" type="DURATION" value="P5Y">five years</TIMEX3> unless the government cuts spending and boosts revenues to cut the fiscal deficit .
But even if a proper government was in place , higher food and fuel prices have increased public discontent , making it harder to implement any austerity measures .
