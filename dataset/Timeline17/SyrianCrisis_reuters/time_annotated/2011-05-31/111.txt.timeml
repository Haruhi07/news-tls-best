SANAA | Tue <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-05-31">May 31 , 2011</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="TIME" value="2011-05-31T16:45">4:45 pm</TIMEX3> EDT SANAA -LRB-
Reuters -RRB- - Street fighting raged in Yemen 's capital on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011-05-31">Tuesday</TIMEX3> ending a tenuous ceasefire between tribal groups and forces loyal to President Ali Abdullah Saleh and edging the impoverished Arab state closer to civil war .
Global powers have been pressing Saleh to sign a Gulf - mediated deal to hand over power to stem spreading chaos in Yemen , a haven for al Qaeda militants and neighbor to the world 's biggest oil exporter , Saudi Arabia .
The turmoil was a factor in keeping up oil prices on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2011-05-31">Tuesday</TIMEX3> , traders said .
` ` The ceasefire agreement has ended , '' a government official said , adding that tribesmen had seized a state building .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2011-05-31">Tuesday</TIMEX3> , there were three main flashpoints in the troubled country -- fighting in the capital , government troops gunning down protesters in Taiz in the south and a battle with al Qaeda and Islamic militants in the coastal city of Zinjibar .
U.N. human rights chief Navi Pillay said 50 people may have been killed by government forces since <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2011-05-29">Sunday</TIMEX3> in Taiz .
Explosions rocked a northern district of Sanaa on <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2011-05-31">Tuesday</TIMEX3> that houses the headquarters of an army division headed by Ali Mohsen , an influential general who has joined the opposition .
` ` I think it is the first time missiles are being used in the street battles , '' a resident said , referring to the loud blasts .
Al Arabiya reported that government forces were bombarding Mohsen 's unit , but the Defense Ministry denied it .
State television said tribesmen were again attacking government buildings , some of which they had evacuated under the truce .
The report could not be independently verified .
A government spokesman earlier suggested breakaway army units had attacked the ruling party 's headquarters in Sanaa .
` ` What was new in <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2011-05-31">today</TIMEX3> 's clashes is the use of armored vehicles ... which the Ahmar -LRB- tribesmen -RRB- do n't have , '' Abdu al - Janadi , a deputy information minister , told Reuters .
Sporadic fighting with tribesmen continued in the nearby Hasaba district , where residents took refuge in basements .
Battles in the capital overnight ended a truce between Saleh 's forces and tribesmen brokered at <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2011-W21-WE">the weekend</TIMEX3> after more than 115 people were killed <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2011-W21">last week</TIMEX3> .
Saleh has defied calls from global leaders , elements in his own military and tens of thousands of protesters to end his 33 - year - rule , which has brought Yemen close to financial ruin .
He has also exasperated his rich Gulf Arab neighbors by three times agreeing to step down , only to pull out of a power transition plan at the last minute and cling on to power .
The opposition coalition issued a statement calling on Gulf states to withdraw their peace plan and ` ` stand with the Yemeni people and its peaceful revolution . ''
The breakaway military accused Saleh of starting a civil war and vowed that he and his entourage would be brought to justice .
Mohammed al - Surmi , a doctor at a Sanaa hospital , said two dead and 17 wounded were brought in .
The Defense Ministry website said one officer and one civilian were killed , and 13 soldiers were wounded in the fighting with tribesmen .
Full casualty figures were not immediately available due to the intensity of the fighting .
` ` Three different dynamics are playing out at the same time , '' said Ginny Hill , who runs the Yemen Forum at the influential Chatham House think - tank in London .
The newest element is the street revolution while the power struggle among the elites and fragmentation of the Arabian Peninsula country have been playing out for some time , she said .
` ` Saleh 's departure could be seen as the beginning of a contested and potentially lengthy process , '' she said .
Saleh 's forces fired on hundreds of protesters in Taiz , about 200 km -LRB- 120 miles -RRB- south of the capital , who were trying to gather at the focal point of rallies dubbed ` ` Freedom Square , '' witnesses and a Reuters cameraman in the city said .
At least three people were killed and scores wounded in the latest fighting there , medical sources said .
U.N. 's Pillay denounced the killings in Taiz where troops used bulldozers and bullets to crack down on protesters .
` ` Such reprehensible acts of violence and indiscriminate attacks on unarmed civilians by armed security officers must stop immediately , '' Pillay said in an Internet posting .
French Foreign Ministry spokesman Bernard Valero condemned the attacks in Taiz .
He also said there was no news on three French aid workers who disappeared in southern Yemen on <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2011-05-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> .
Paris believes they were kidnapped .
Further south , government troops and locals have been trying to oust al Qaeda and Islamist militants from Zinjibar after they seized the town of 20,000 at <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2011-W21-WE">the weekend</TIMEX3> .
Residents said bodies were strewn on the streets , the national bank building was burned and explosions rocked the city .
Most of the inhabitants have fled .
` ` Explosions lit the sky , '' one resident said .
The United States and Saudi Arabia , both targets of attacks by Yemen - based al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula , are worried that a spreading state of anarchy is emboldening the group .
Opposition leaders have accused Saleh of deliberately allowing Zinjibar , located near a sea lane where about 3 million barrels of oil pass daily , to fall to al Qaeda to try to show how chaotic Yemen would be without him .
At least 320 people have been killed since protests started <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2011-01" mod="APPROX">about four months ago</TIMEX3> , inspired by popular uprisings that ended the reign of the long - standing rulers of Tunisia and Egypt .
