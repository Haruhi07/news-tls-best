LONDON | Mon <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2011-07-11">Jul 11 , 2011</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="TIME" value="2011-07-11T11:50">11:50 am</TIMEX3> BST LONDON -LRB-

Sterling fell against the dollar on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2011-07-11">Monday</TIMEX3> , tracking losses in a broadly weak euro as concerns that Italy may be the next country to be affected by the euro zone debt crisis prompted investors to seek safety in the U.S. currency .
The pound suffered as the euro fell roughly 1 percent versus the dollar , but losses in the single currency were supportive for sterling , as it kept the euro below 90 pence following a poke above that psychologically crucial level <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2011-07" mod="START">earlier this month</TIMEX3> .
Market participants said sterling would continue to be jerked around by the euro and developments in the euro zone as finance ministers hold an emergency meeting on <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2011-07-11">Monday</TIMEX3> .
Analysts say euro - negative comments or developments would drag the pound lower versus the dollar .
` ` On one side , sterling should be weak as well -LRB- along with the euro -RRB- because if the euro zone is weak the UK could be affected given its proximity , '' said Ankita Dudani , currency strategist at RBS .
` ` But the other argument is that if people are pulling money out of European countries , they could look at the UK as an alternative . ''
Dudani added that she agreed with the former argument and saw more scope for the pound to fall against the dollar .
RBS sees fair value for the pair at $ 1.55 , she said .
Given the spotlight on euro zone debt problems , market participants said the pound showed limited reaction to data showing the economy grew only modestly in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2011-Q2">the second quarter</TIMEX3> .
Signs that the economy is struggling to recover have been dogging the pound , as such fragility is expected to keep the Bank of England from raising interest rates anytime soon .
The central bank has acknowledged the possibility that it may even consider more quantitative easing if the economy is unable to snap out of its rout .
Low interest rates and QE are negative for sterling as they add to its rate disadvantage versus other currencies were rates are rising .
Sterling fell around 0.6 percent on the day to a session low of $ 1.5946 .
It retreated from a session high of $ 1.6042 after early gains fizzled ahead of resistance at $ 1.6048 , the 200 - day moving average .
The pound offered little reaction to data from the Chambers of Commerce indicated that the economy expanded by 0.3 percent in <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2011-04">April</TIMEX3> - <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2011-06">June</TIMEX3> , and that a slowdown in export demand suggests the recovery is shaky .
Broad demand for safe - haven dollars , the world 's most liquid currency , kept the pound in range of $ 1.5912 , and a fall below this level would take sterling to its weakest in <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DURATION" value="P5M" mod="MORE_THAN">more than five months</TIMEX3> .
Traders said a test of the $ 1.5900 level was possible in the near term , particularly if the euro continues to suffer .
` ` The risk is for a break lower , '' said a trader in London .
` ` It probably needs a lower EUR\/USD to spark the move but with EZ debt , lack of UK growth and no chance of UK rate rise soon I guess eventual downside break is likely . ''
The euro slipped 0.3 percent to 88.40 pence , its weakest since <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2011-06" mod="END">late June</TIMEX3> .
The single currency has been unable to maintain gains above 90 pence hit <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2011-07" mod="START">earlier this month</TIMEX3> .
Dudani at RBS said that level would provide strong resistance , and that any rise above that level would offer an opportunity to sell , given ongoing debt risks in the euro zone .
Disdain for sterling was reflected in the latest IMM data on speculator positioning , which showed a jump in the net short positions in the pound -- bets to sell the currency -- to 31,669 contracts <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2011-W27">last week</TIMEX3> , the highest in roughly <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> .

While hefty positioning in favor of the pound 's downside adds to the view that investors are keen to sell the currency , it can also be seen as a warning sign of an impending shift in positioning , which may result in a correction .
