By - standers watch as a booby - trapped car burns after an explosion in the southern Yemeni port city of Aden <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2011-07-20">July 20 , 2011</TIMEX3> .
ADEN\/SANAA | We d <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011-07-20">Jul 20 , 2011</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="TIME" value="2011-07-20T19:17">7:17 pm</TIMEX3> BST ADEN\/SANAA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A blast in a booby - trapped car killed a Briton living in Yemen 's southern port city of Aden on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2011-07-20">Wednesday</TIMEX3> , officials said , and the British government urged its citizens to leave the country .
Opposition officials said one of their political leaders survived an assassination attempt in the capital Sanaa and warned of further unrest .
A security source told Reuters he believed militants were behind the blast that killed the long - time British resident of Aden , who was in his 60s , as he started his car .
The victim was an independent surveyor working for marine and insurance companies in Yemen .
A Western shipping source based in Aden said the Briton had just returned from surveying a tanker attacked in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2011-07">July</TIMEX3> by pirates off Yemen 's coast .
` ` We tend to think that it was some kind of terrorist attack because he was well known , '' the security source said .
Attacks on foreigners are rare in the port city , which lies east of a strategic shipping lane through which some 3 million barrels of oil pass daily .
The impoverished Arabian Peninsula state , neighbor to Saudi Arabia , is grappling with growing turmoil as mass protests calling for an end to President Ali Abdullah Saleh 's rule drag into a sixth month .
Washington and Riyadh fear the unrest gives al Qaeda 's Yemen - based wing more room to operate .
Witnesses in Aden said the British victim 's car blew up as soon as he turned on the engine , shattering windows in nearby buildings on Aden 's Mualla Plaza .
` ` He started the car and it immediately exploded and he was engulfed in flames , '' a witness said by telephone .
One passer - by was critically wounded in the blast which also damaged nearby buildings , a municipal official said .
She said there was no indication who was behind the explosion .
` ` It 's clear that there was some kind of explosive device placed in his car , '' she said .
A British Foreign Office spokeswoman confirmed the Briton 's death and said the government was advising all British nationals against traveling to the whole of Yemen , a position which ` ` could n't be any firmer . ''
Aden had been relatively quiet in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent months</TIMEX3> , even as protests in other parts of the country erupted into sporadic violence .
The neighbouring Abyan province has witnessed daily bloodshed since Islamist militants seized the city of Jaar in <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2011-03">March</TIMEX3> and the provincial capital of Zinjibar in <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2011-05">May</TIMEX3> .
The army , which says the militants are part of al Qaeda 's Yemen - based wing , launched an offensive to retake Zinjibar <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2011-07-15">five days ago</TIMEX3> but has yet to regain the city .
The army impose a security belt around Aden <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">several weeks ago</TIMEX3> to try to prevent more militants from slipping into the strategic port city .
It had previously reported that several al Qaeda linked operatives had snuck into Aden , where some 54,000 Abyan residents have sought refuge .
Further north in the capital Sanaa , opposition officials said the head of the leading Islamist party Islah survived an attack by gunmen .
Sanaa has been the scene of rising violence in <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent days</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2011-07-22">following weeks</TIMEX3> of relative calm after Saleh traveled to Saudi Arabia for treatment on wounds he suffered in a bomb blast at his compound .
Yemen 's opposition coalition said the gunmen fired on Islah leader Mohammed al - Yadumi 's car
but he escaped the attack .
The group blamed Saleh 's family and forces loyal to him , and warned the move could spark worse violence in the fragmented nation .
` ` Targeting the head of Islah is an attempt to plunge the country into civil war .
Saleh 's family is deluded in thinking it can remain in power , '' the coalition said in a statement .
