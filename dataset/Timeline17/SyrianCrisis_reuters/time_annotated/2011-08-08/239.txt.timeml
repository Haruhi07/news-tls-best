Reuters -RRB- - Gulf Arab states broke their silence over a bloody crackdown on popular unrest in Syria , recalling their envoys in a pointed rebuke of President Bashar al - Assad 's behavior and significantly deepening his international isolation .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P1D" mod="LESS_THAN">less than 24 hours</TIMEX3> , the island kingdom of Bahrain and oil - rich neighbor Kuwait followed Saudi Arabia 's lead by summoning their ambassadors from Damascus ` ` for consultations . ''
Saudi Arabia , an absolute monarchy normally loath to criticize other Arab autocrats but <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> wary of giving an opening to reform elements at home , pulled its envoy late on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2011-08-07">Sunday</TIMEX3> .
King Abdullah , in an extraordinary statement read on Al Arabiya television , said Syria 's fierce military crackdown on <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P5M" mod="LESS_THAN">nearly five months</TIMEX3> of demonstrations for more political freedoms had ` ` nothing to do with religion , or values , or ethics . ''
Abdullah , who has approved billions of dollars in handouts to Saudi citizens <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2011">this year</TIMEX3> in a move analysts said was aimed at buffering his monarchy from political reform pressure , issued a stern warning that Syria must be open to change .
` ` Syria should think wisely before it 's too late and issue and enact reforms , '' he said .
` ` Either it chooses wisdom on its own or it will be pulled down into the depths of turmoil and loss . ''
` ` The action of Gulf states has served to isolate the Assad regime in the Arab world , thereby signaling a major strategic shift in the region : From tacit support of the Syrian regime 's action to outright condemnation , '' said Michael Stephens , analyst at the Royal United Services Institute -LRB- RUSI -RRB- based in Doha .
While unlikely to lead to intervention in Syria , the Gulf comments marked the sharpest Arab criticism leveled against any Arab state since a wave of protests began rocking the Middle East in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2011-01">January</TIMEX3> , toppling veteran rulers in Tunisia and Egypt .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2011-08-08">Monday</TIMEX3> , Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed al - Sabah told reporters in parliament that he would meet his counterparts across the Gulf to discuss conditions in Syria .
` ` When the number of innocent people killed exceeds 2,000 , it is something totally unacceptable , '' he said , while ruling out any military action against the fellow Arab country .
Hours later , Bahrain , which itself suppressed a protest movement in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2011-03">March</TIMEX3> , joined growing condemnation of Syria when Foreign Minister Sheikh Khaled al - Khalifa announced the recall of his country 's ambassador .
` ` Bahrain has summoned its ambassador for consultation and stresses the importance of prudent action , '' he posted on his Twitter account .
Apart from Libya 's civil war , Syria 's military crackdown has been the most violent outgrowth of unrest in the Arab world <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2011">this year</TIMEX3> .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2011-08-08">Monday</TIMEX3> , tanks extended operations to crush protesters in Syria 's Sunni Muslim tribal heartland .
Assad 's government says it is fighting criminals and armed extremists who have provoked violence by attacking its troops .
Syrian rights activists and Western countries say Assad 's forces have attacked peaceful protesters .
But sharp words against Syria by Gulf states are unlikely at this time to be followed by any decisive action .
Analysts expect Gulf governments to stop short of supporting intervention in Syria as they did against distant Libya , where the United Arab Emirates and Qatar have sent planes to back NATO air strikes .
In ruling out military action , Kuwait echoed an Arab League statement earlier on <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2011-08-08">Monday</TIMEX3> saying that the pan - Arab body would use persuasion rather than ` ` drastic measures '' to press for an end to Syria 's bloodshed .
Despite a lack of appetite for military moves , Saudi Arabia has played a ` ` game changer '' role in bringing Gulf states to heap pressure on another discredited Arab leader to quit , Yemen 's Ali Abdullah Saleh , RUSI 's Stephens said .
Qatar , which has sought to lead Arab diplomacy as the unrest spreads , was the first to recall its envoy to Syria in <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2011-07">July</TIMEX3> .

Positive change for everyone concerned .
President Bashar al - Assad should come to a negotiating table and work out a peaceful resolution to this very unnecessary
