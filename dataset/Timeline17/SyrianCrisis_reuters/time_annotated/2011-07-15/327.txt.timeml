Reuters -RRB- - Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khameini backs offering $ 5.8 billion in aid to Syria to bolster its economy , a French newspaper said <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-07-15">Friday</TIMEX3> , citing a report by a Tehran think - tank linked to Iran 's leadership .
Damascus has long been Tehran 's main ally among otherwise mainly hostile Arab states .
After <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P4M">four months</TIMEX3> of popular unrest , Syria 's economy is reeling under the weight of strikes , reduced oil exports , scaled - back trade and international sanctions .
Its troubles have prompted Iran 's leadership to consider offering $ 5.8 billion in financial help , including a three - month loan worth $ 1.5 billion to be made available immediately , French business daily Les Echos said .
It added that Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has backed the idea of the aid , which was outlined in a secret report by the Center for Strategic Research , a think tank linked to the Iranian leadership .
It was not possible to verify the report <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2011-07-15">Friday</TIMEX3> .
Iran , Les Echos said , could also provide 290,000 barrels of oil to Syria <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EACH">each day</TIMEX3> over <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2011-08">the next month</TIMEX3> while helping to boost border controls to stop Syrians from fleeing the country for Lebanon with cash .
After <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P4M">four months</TIMEX3> of civil uprising in Syria , human rights groups report that more than 1,400 civilian have been killed , drawing a chorus of condemnation from around the world .
International sanctions are only targeted at Syria 's leaders , not its banks and companies .
But France and the United States are pressing for tougher penalties and a U.N. Security Council resolution condemning the crackdown , after the embassies of both countries in Syria were attacked .
