\ * Capital spending to rise <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2012">2012</TIMEX3> - <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3> , overheads frozen \ * Budget to assume ambitious oil production ABUJA , <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2011-10-05">Oct 5</TIMEX3> -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Nigeria plans to end costly fuel subsidies in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P2012Y">the 2012 fiscal year</TIMEX3> to release funds for infrastructure projects and to create jobs , while overall spending <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2012">next year</TIMEX3> is likely to rise , according to plans sent for lawmakers approval .
Subsidising the cost of fuel , mainly diesel , petrol and kerosene , costs the government 1.2 trillion naira -LRB- $ 7.5 billion -RRB- in lost revenues but removing the support will be unpopular with many Nigerians who see it as the only benefit they gain from living in an oil - rich country .
Previous efforts to remove subsidies have resulted in nationwide strike action in Africa 's most populous nation , where most people live on less than $ 2 <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> .
There have been several protests <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2011">this year</TIMEX3> in anticipation of deregulation .
` ` A major component of the policy of fiscal consolidation is the government 's intent to phase out the fuel subsidy beginning from <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="P2012Y">2012 fiscal year</TIMEX3> , '' said a <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2012">2012</TIMEX3> - <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3> Medium Term Fiscal Framework -LRB- MTFF -RRB- and Medium Term Expenditure Framework -LRB- MTEF -RRB- paper .
` ` This will free up about 1.2 trillion naira in savings , part of which can be deployed into providing safety nets for poor segments of society to ameliorate the effects of the subsidy removal , '' the federal government document said .
The document is with the national assembly .
How quickly lawmakers pass the plans will give an indication of how soon and the next budget will be ready for implementation .
The <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3> budget process was chaotic after lawmakers inflated spending plans before the president reduced them again , finally passing the budget in <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2011-05">May</TIMEX3> .
Finance Minister and Coordinator of the Economy , Ngozi Okonjo - Iweala , has pledged to avoid the problems of the <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3> budget by getting the spending plans organised earlier .
The fiscal strategy paper hints that the government will forward a 4.8 trillion naira budget for <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2012">2012</TIMEX3> to the national assembly <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2011-10" mod="END">later this month</TIMEX3> , up from around 4.5 trillion in <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2011">this year</TIMEX3> 's budget passed in <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2011-05">May</TIMEX3> .
Nigeria only spends around a quarter of its budget on capital expenditure , meaning most of the billions of dollars it earns in oil revenues are spent keeping its government running .
However , capital expenditure looks set to rise slightly to 1.32 trillion naira in <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2012">2012</TIMEX3> as a component of the overall budget , while this should improve as overhead allocations are to be frozen until <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3> , the documents showed .
` ` Although aggregate expenditure is expected to increase from 4.8 trillion in <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="2012">2012</TIMEX3> to 5.18 trillion in <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3> , concerted efforts are being made to make savings from overheads as allocations will be frozen till <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3> , '' it said .
Okonjo - Iweala will need to persuade lawmakers to get the budget passed when it arrives at the national assembly but they have previously fought hard to defend recurrent expenditure levels , some of which make up their large wages and expenses .
The former World Bank chief has pledged to keep the fiscal deficit under 3 percent and if the MTFF is adhered to the deficit would be reduced to 2.69 percent <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DATE" value="2012">next year</TIMEX3> .
` ` The Increase in capital expenditure is a welcome development , given the excesses of the <TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> past , in which recurrent spending was increased greatly , to the detriment of Nigeria 's oil savings and wider macroeconomic stability , '' said Razia Khan , Head of Africa Research at Standard Chartered .
` ` Even more positive is the proposal to remove the fuel subsidy put to national assembly .
The subsidy was expensive , responsible for significant distortions and rent - seeking opportunities in the Nigerian economy , with little overall benefit . ''
The <TIMEX3 tid="t36" type="DATE" value="2012">2012</TIMEX3> budget will be based on the assumption of an ambitious average oil production of 2.48 million barrels per day and a benchmark price LCOc1 of $ 75 dollars per barrel .
Nigeria 's <TIMEX3 tid="t38" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> oil output is around 2.5 million bpd and the projections leave little room for maneuver should Nigeria suffer outages , common in the past , while global economic uncertainty by no means guarantees oil prices will stay high .
