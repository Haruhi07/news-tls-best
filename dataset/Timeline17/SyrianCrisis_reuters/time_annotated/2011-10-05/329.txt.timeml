BEIRUT | We d <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-10-05">Oct 5 , 2011</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2011-10-05T19:49">7:49 pm</TIMEX3> EDT BEIRUT -LRB-
Reuters -RRB- - Turkey said on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-10-05">Wednesday</TIMEX3> it would impose sanctions on Syria despite the blocking of any U.N. measures against President Bashar al - Assad for his crackdown on dissent .
Russia and China handed Assad a diplomatic victory on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011-10-04">Tuesday</TIMEX3> by vetoing a Western - backed U.N. resolution that could have led to U.N. sanctions on Damascus , but Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan promised action of his own .
` ` Naturally the veto ... can not prevent sanctions , '' Erdogan said .
` ` We will of necessity implement a package of sanctions . ''
Erdogan , who is visiting South Africa , has said he will announce the package after he visits a Syrian refugee camp in Turkey in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="PXD">the next few days</TIMEX3> .
The double veto by Moscow and Beijing infuriated Western powers which have already imposed their own sanctions on Syria and were trying to pave the way for a U.N. embargo , and will reinforce Assad 's hold on power -- at least in the short term .
` ` This is a sad day for the Syrian people .
It 's a sad day for the Security Council , '' France 's Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said .
Germany also expressed disappointment .
A government spokesman said the draft resolution would have been an important signal of support for many Syrians ` ` who for months have been taking to the streets for political freedom . ''
Syria 's state news agency SANA said Damascus welcomed the veto .
` ` It restores hope for a balanced world ... after a long time of American and European domination which turned the Security Council 's resolutions into a tool for punishing defenders of independence and liberation , '' SANA said .
The draft resolution received nine votes in favor and four abstentions .
U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice said Washington was outraged and called for ` ` tough targeted sanctions '' on Damascus .
Russia 's ambassador Vitaly Churkin said Moscow rejected the threat of sanctions on Syria and China 's envoy Li Baodong said Beijing opposed ` ` interference in -LRB- Syria 's -RRB- internal affairs . ''
Russia has close ties with Assad 's government , which has been a client for arms sales , and has a naval maintenance facility on Syria 's Mediterranean coast .
Beijing and Moscow , which had voiced concern that the draft could pave the way for Libya - style military intervention , also want to limit Western influence in the Middle East , while the United States and Europe have long sought to loosen Syria 's alliance with Iran .
Assad has used tanks and troops to crush an uprising which erupted in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2011-03">March</TIMEX3> , inspired by regional revolts which toppled three North African leaders <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2011">this year</TIMEX3> .
The United Nations says 2,700 civilians have been killed .
Damascus blames the violence on foreign - backed armed groups which it says have killed at least 700 security personnel .
Syria 's economy is reeling from the impact of the unrest and U.S. and European sanctions on the small but key oil sector .
Assad faces a more united opposition after groups in exile came together in Istanbul on <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2011-10-02">Sunday</TIMEX3> to call for his downfall , but the U.N. vote marks a setback to his opponents who had hoped for an escalation in international pressure on Damascus .
` ` We deeply regret the positions of Russia and China toward the resolution , '' said Omar Idlibi of the grassroots Local Coordination Committee in Beirut , adding he had ` ` not lost hope in the international community . ''
Idlibi said the opposition was studying options including a general strike or civil disobedience campaign , but analysts said Assad did not look threatened in the immediate future .
` ` The mere fact that Assad can avoid international sanctions for the time being reinforces his position in the short term , '' said Ayham Kamel from the Eurasia thinktank .
` ` Assad is going to remain in power in the near term .
I do n't think there are signs of imminent collapse
but Syria faces challenges across the country -- the economy , insecurity across the country , and a more organized opposition . ''
Syria banned most imports <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2011-09">last month</TIMEX3> to try and conserve dwindling foreign currency reserves , but rescinded the measure on <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2011-10-04">Tuesday</TIMEX3> after a spike in prices and disquiet among an influential merchant class that has been backing Assad .
Turkish sanctions could also have a major impact .

But Turkish officials have made clear that any measures will target Assad 's government and not the Syrian people .
For this reason Turkey has ruled out cutting off electricity sales or reducing the flow of water in the Euphrates river into Syria .
Bilateral trade between Turkey and Syria was worth $ 2.5 billion in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3> , and Turkish firms had investments of $ 260 million in Syria One target of sanctions is likely to be Syria 's state banking system , which could effectively block purchases of Syrian crude oil .
Other possible measures could freeze Turkish cooperation in oil and gas projects involving state - run firms .
State television broadcast an interview on <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2011-10-05">Wednesday</TIMEX3> with a young woman who denied reports by rights groups <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2011-09">last month</TIMEX3> that she had been killed and mutilated , possibly in state custody .
The mother of Zainab al - Hosni , 18 , from the city of Homs , confirmed that the woman on television was her daughter , who was reported to have killed after disappearing in <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2011-07">July</TIMEX3> , Human Rights Watch said .
` ` We spoke to the family and they were able to confirm that the person who appeared on TV was Zainab , '' said Nadim Houry of HRW in Beirut .
` ` The mother said she was her daughter . ''
Hosni became an icon for the Syrian revolt against Assad after the body of a badly burned , decapitated woman was found in a morgue by Hosni 's family , according to reports by HRW and Amnesty International .
After months of peaceful protests , some army deserters and dissidents have taken up arms , prompting military operations against them , especially in areas bordering Turkey and Jordan .
Colonel Riad al - Asaad , a Syrian officer who defected and fled to Turkey , said <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2011-W39">last week</TIMEX3> 10,000 soldiers had deserted , but authorities have denied any army defections , saying the military operations were a response to appeals by residents .
Assad retains control of the military , whose mostly Sunni Muslim rank and file are largely commanded by officers of his minority Alawite sect .
Syria has mostly closed its doors to independent media , making it hard to verify events , but a trickle of desertions appears to have gathered pace in <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DURATION" value="PXW">the last several weeks</TIMEX3> .
