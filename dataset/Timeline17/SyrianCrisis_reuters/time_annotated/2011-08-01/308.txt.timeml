The Swiss franc soared on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2011-08-01">Monday</TIMEX3> and the U.S. dollar rallied against the euro , with demand for safe - haven currencies set to continue on concerns about slowing global economic growth and a possible cut of the United States ' credit rating .
U.S. manufacturing grew at its slowest pace in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">two years</TIMEX3> in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2011-07">July</TIMEX3> , the Institute for Supply Management said , casting doubt on expectations the faltering recovery would quickly regain steam .
In Europe , the euro zone manufacturing PMI also fell in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2011-07">July</TIMEX3> to a <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">two year</TIMEX3> low and perhaps more worrying , China 's official government PMI dropped to its lowest level in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">two years</TIMEX3> also .
Initial euphoria about the U.S. Congress agreeing on a deal to raise the government 's statutory borrowing limit faded as investors worried that the country might still lose its triple - A credit rating even though the risk of a default appeared to be off the table .
` ` The undercurrents of risk aversion still remain very strong , '' said Samarjit Shankar , managing director of global foreign exchange strategy at BNY Mellon in Boston .
` ` Existing riskier positions that were funded in the yen , Swiss franc and dollars are being unwound , which is why all three currencies have been gaining relative to the others . ''
The Swiss franc climbed to record highs against both the euro and dollar , continuing a <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> trend as investors fretted about sovereign debt crises on both sides of the Atlantic .
` ` The Swiss franc still stands out head and shoulders above the other so - called safe - haven currencies , '' Shankar said .
The euro plumbed a record low at 1.1030 Swiss francs on trading platform EBS , and last traded down 1.3 percent at 1.1171 francs .
The dollar hit as low as 0.77323 Swiss franc , before pulling back to 0.7834 , down 0.2 percent on the day .
U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said debt limit increase legislation would be completed in the Senate by <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2011-07-26">Tuesday</TIMEX3> , but uncertainty about its fate in the more fractious Republican - controlled House of Representatives kept markets nervous .
The cuts proposed <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DURATION" value="P10Y" mod="MORE_THAN">over the next ten years</TIMEX3> also fall short of the $ 4 trillion set by some ratings agencies as the threshold needed to avert a U.S. ratings downgrade .
` ` The markets are unsure about how this will play out and it is down to the wire , so the market is cautious <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3> , '' said Jessica Hoversen , FX analyst at MF Global in New York .
The euro fell to $ 1.41847 and last traded at $ 1.4260 , down 0.9 percent on the day .
Yields on Italian and Spanish bonds continued to rise , suggesting persistent worries about the risk of contagion in the euro zone crisis and adding to risk aversion the market .
The dollar fell as low as 76.29 yen on EBS , its weakest since coordinated intervention by major central banks in mid - <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2011-03">March</TIMEX3> to weaken the surging Japanese currency .
The record low for the pair was at 76.25 set in mid - <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2011-03">March</TIMEX3> .
The yen also jumped against the euro and Australian and New Zealand dollars .
The U.S. currency briefly surged against the yen in morning New York trade , though traders said the move did not appear to be related to intervention by Japanese authorities .
A trader said the jump in the dollar against the yen was partly due to a big order from a large Japanese bank under 76.50 yen and was part of the normal flow of the market .
An official from the Japanese Ministry of Finance in Tokyo said that while the office is aware of currency movements , he can not comment on the dollar\/yen move .
Still , the intraday spike heightened the market 's alertness for potential official yen selling , helping the dollar rebound to 77.17 yen , up 0.6 percent on the day .
Analysts said a slew of key U.S. economic releases in the <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">coming days</TIMEX3> , including <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2011-07-29">Friday</TIMEX3> 's <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="SET" value="XXXX-XX">monthly</TIMEX3> jobs report , should keep risk appetite subdued .
Against a basket of currencies , the dollar index was up 0.6 percent at 74.314 . .
