LONDON | Tue <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2011-08-09">Aug 9 , 2011</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2011-08-09T13:45">1:45 pm</TIMEX3> BST LONDON -LRB-
Reuters -RRB- - Gold is set to widen its premium over platinum after hitting parity for the first time in 2 - 1\/<TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">2 years</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-W32">this week</TIMEX3> , with no end yet in sight to the potent cocktail of fear factors that are benefiting safe havens at the expense of cyclical assets .
Gold prices rose above those of platinum for the first time since <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2008-12">December 2008</TIMEX3> late on <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2011-08-08">Monday</TIMEX3> .
The last time this happened , the situation reversed within <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="PXD">a few days</TIMEX3> , and traders said then that the convergence of the gold - platinum ratio gave a clear signal to sell gold and buy platinum .
<TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2011-08-09">Today</TIMEX3> 's backdrop is very different .
` ` Gold as a defensive asset is being driven higher at the moment by risk aversion , and platinum as a cyclical asset is under pressure because growth is slowing , '' said Michael Widmer , an analyst at Bank of America - Merrill Lynch .
` ` We were there around the great recession -LRB- <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> -RRB- , and then you had the various stimulus packages hitting the market , and you saw the prices of the two metals starting to diverge again , '' he said .
` ` The macro picture is a bit different this time around .
I do n't think that it is a compelling trade . ''
In contrast to the situation in <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> , gold 's premium to platinum is a function of its own strength , rather than a falling platinum price .
Gold hit a record $ 1,778.29 an ounce <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2011-W32">this week</TIMEX3> as concerns over economic stability and debt crises in the euro zone and United States sparked heavy buying among investors .
Platinum prices have eased by just over 2 percent <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2011">this year</TIMEX3> , although they have not dropped in the same way as some industrial metals such as copper , which is down 8.2 percent in electronic trading , or zinc down 13.2 percent .
Although platinum is nominally a precious metal , the bulk of its demand comes from the industrial sector , particularly carmakers who use it to make catalytic converters .
This makes it more sensitive to threats to growth .
<TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2011-05">This may</TIMEX3> mean it still has some way to fall , potentially further widening its discount to gold , analysts said .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> , platinum plummeted from record highs to fall below the price of gold , said Deutsche Bank analyst Michael Lewis .
` ` <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> ... this parity has occurred and we have n't priced in that recession risk yet , '' he said .
` ` There is more risk that if we get negative data , it could sustain that discount of platinum for a longer period of time . ''
A short - term reversal in the ratio is possible .
The <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> rush for safety sparked by Standard & Poor 's decision to downgrade the U.S. credit rating on <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="2011-08-05">Friday</TIMEX3> has sparked a 6.3 percent rally in gold prices in <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DURATION" value="P2D">the past two days</TIMEX3> alone , their biggest two - day rise since <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> .
That kind of jump has typically been followed by a correction , as was seen in <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DATE" value="2011-04" mod="END">late April</TIMEX3> after gold 's initial break above $ 1,500 an ounce .
At the same time , there are some factors that could suggest a short - term rise in platinum prices as the threat of strike action among miners in South Africa , the source of four out of five ounces of the world 's platinum supply , continues to loom .
But any possible reversal in the fortunes of gold and platinum are likely to be brief , with the wider economic picture still overwhelmingly pointing to continued appetite for so - called havens at the expense of assets seen as higher risk .
` ` If you look at the platinum group metals and other industrial metals as well as oil , it is all a one - way street -- down , '' said Afshin Nabavi , head of trading at MKS Finance .
` ` Gold and the Swiss franc are really the only safe havens . ''
In the longer term , gold prices will undoubtedly correct at some point , with a rise in U.S. interest rates expected to be the turning point in the yellow metal 's decade - long rally .
Meanwhile , platinum 's underlying supply fundamentals still point to higher prices as South Africa 's mining sector faces stronger cost pressures from an increased focus on safety , rising inflation and higher wage demands .
This should give long - term support to the metal .
But in the <TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> environment , few are looking that far out .
` ` On a historical basis , the ratio looks cheap , but that is not necessarily reason to buy , '' UBS analyst Edel Tully said in a research note .
` ` If we were prepared to buy the ratio <TIMEX3 tid="t36" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> and hold it for <TIMEX3 tid="t38" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> or two , it would probably be a good trade , given that platinum 's fundamentals signal a lot more tightness over the medium term .
But as investors struggle to make money in the short term , positioning for the medium term is in short supply . ''
