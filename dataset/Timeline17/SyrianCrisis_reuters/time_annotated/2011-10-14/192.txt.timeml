Reuters -RRB- - European members of the U.N. Security Council clashed with Russia and China on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-10-14">Friday</TIMEX3> by raising concerns about Syria and the looming specter of civil war during a closed - door meeting , council diplomats said .
Speaking on condition of anonymity , several diplomats said the French , British , German and Portuguese envoys supported a statement issued on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011-10-14">Friday</TIMEX3> by U.N. human rights chief Navi Pillay , who called for international protection of civilians in Syria and warned of a possible civil war .
Syrian forces shot dead at least six people protesting against President Bashar al - Assad on <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2011-10-14">Friday</TIMEX3> , activists said , <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P10D">10 days</TIMEX3> after Russia and China joined forces on a rare ` ` double veto '' to kill a European - drafted Security Council resolution that would have condemned Syria and hinted at possible future sanctions .
<TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2011-10-14">Friday</TIMEX3> 's European push on Syria elicited an angry response from Russian deputy U.N. envoy Alexander Pankin , who complained that French Ambassador Gerard Araud was flouting normal procedure by introducing issues ` ` not on the agenda of the meeting , '' a diplomat present at the meeting told Reuters .
The Chinese envoy told the council that since Pillay 's remarks on Syria had not been requested by the Security Council , it should not take them into consideration , envoys said .
The closed - door council meeting followed the earlier adoption on <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2011-10-14">Friday</TIMEX3> of two routine resolutions in public sessions .
Its official agenda was a <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="SET" value="XXXX-XX">monthly</TIMEX3> review by the U.N. Department of Public Affairs on world affairs and conflicts .
During the meeting , Araud told the council that ` ` the advocates of inaction on Syria should draw conclusions from the latest appalling developments , '' according to the French U.N. mission 's Twitter page .
Araud was referring to Russia , China , Brazil , India and South Africa , the five ` ` BRICS '' emerging markets nations that have resisted the Western push for tough council action on Syria since the government crackdown against pro - democracy protesters began over half <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2010-10-14">a year ago</TIMEX3> , diplomats said .
Portuguese Ambassador Jose Filipe Moraes Cabral , one of the co - sponsors of <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2011-W40">last week</TIMEX3> 's failed resolution , confirmed he had said the council should revisit the idea of condemning Damascus .
` ` The situation -LRB- in Syria -RRB- is deteriorating fast , '' Cabral said .
` ` The council should come back to it . ''
German Ambassador Peter Wittig echoed Cabral 's remarks , saying the council should not give up on Syria .
` ` Since the double veto was cast , the situation has continued to be extremely concerning , '' he told reporters , adding that he told the council Pillay 's report ` ` paints a very grim picture of the continuing repression . ''
` ` We said -LRB- to the Security Council -RRB- that if we let things slide , we will be at the brink of a civil war , '' he said .
The British and Colombian envoys made similar remarks , though diplomats said U.S. Deputy Ambassador Jeffrey DeLaurentis did not touch on Syria during his remarks .
Brazil , India and South Africa , which abstained from <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2011-W40">last week</TIMEX3> 's vote on the Syria resolution , did not mention the issue when they addressed the council , diplomats said .
