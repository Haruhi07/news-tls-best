Reuters -RRB- - Syrian villagers pulled 13 bodies from a mass grave near the southern city of Deraa on <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2011-05-16">Monday</TIMEX3> , residents said , and thousands joined a night - time march in a Damascus suburb demanding the overthrow of the government .
Deraa residents say hundreds of people have been missing since tanks and soldiers moved in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2011-04">last month</TIMEX3> to crush the cradle of opposition to President Bashar al - Assad 's 11 - year rule .
They said villagers digging in farmland in the outskirts of the city uncovered the decomposed bodies of Abdullah Abdul Aziz Aba Zaid , 62 , and four of his children .
The villagers also found the bodies of a woman , a child and six men , all unidentified , residents said .
It was not clear when they died , but Deraa residents say dozens of civilians were killed during the military assault on the city 's old quarter .
Syrian and international rights groups say Syrian forces have killed at least 700 civilians across the country since the first protests broke out in Deraa on <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2011-03-18">March 18</TIMEX3> .
The report on the mass grave could not be confirmed independently .
Thousands of demonstrators marched through the Damascus suburb of Saqba on <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="TIME" value="2011-05-16TNI">Monday night</TIMEX3> at the funeral of Ahmad Ataya , who died of wounds inflicted when security forces fired at a pro - democracy rally in the capital <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2011-04">last month</TIMEX3> .
A witness said the demonstrators marched at night to avoid the tough security measures that are in force during the day .
It was the biggest protest in the Damascus outskirts since a security crackdown <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2011-W17">three weeks ago</TIMEX3> .
Authorities have blamed most of the violence during the wave of protests on armed groups backed by Islamists and outside powers , who they say have killed more than 120 members of the security forces .
Witnesses in Deraa said tanks were still positioned at main city junctions and in the outskirts , but authorities had shortened the curfew by <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DURATION" value="PT3H">three hours</TIMEX3> , allowing people out on the streets until 5.00 pm -LRB- <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="TIME" value="2011-05-16T14:00">1400 GMT</TIMEX3> -RRB- .
The official Syrian news agency said Assad met a delegation from Deraa and they discussed the ` ` positive atmosphere there as a result of cooperation between the residents and the army . ''
Further north , at least 15 tanks deployed around Arida , near the border town of Tel Kelakh which troops entered on <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2011-05-14">Saturday</TIMEX3> after protests erupted against Assad , and their arrival prompted dozens of families to flee into neighboring Lebanon .
An activists ' protest group said at least seven civilians were killed in Tel Kelakh on <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2011-05-15">Sunday</TIMEX3> when troops shelled the town and sniper fire killed one civilian on <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2011-05-16">Monday</TIMEX3> , raising the death toll in the army 's assault since <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2011-05-14">Saturday</TIMEX3> to 12 .

The Syrian state news agency said five soldiers were killed in confrontations with armed groups in Tel Kalakh .
One resident reported intermittent shelling of Tel Kelakh and bursts of machinegun fire on <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2011-05-16">Monday</TIMEX3> , but the army appeared not to have advanced beyond the outskirts .
` ` Tel Kelakh is a ghost town .
There are no doctors .
Snipers are on the roof of the main hospital .
Phones , water and electricity are cut , '' Mohammad al - Dandashi told Reuters from the town by satellite phone .

A few families from Hilat , another border village , streamed into Lebanon on <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2011-05-16">Monday</TIMEX3> as did two wounded civilians from Tel Kelakh who were seeking medical care , family members said .
For <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DURATION" value="P2M">the past two months</TIMEX3> Syrian soldiers and police have been trying to quell demonstrations across the country calling for Assad 's overthrow .
They have tended to crack down on a flashpoint area for <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DURATION" value="PXD">several days</TIMEX3> , using tank and rifle fire and mass arrests to subdue it , and then move on to another area .
Troops backed by armor have <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> deployed in or around towns and villages across the southern Hauran plain , the central province of Homs and areas near the coast .
Security forces have also tightened their grip on Damascus and its suburbs .
The Lebanese army said it had sent reinforcements to the border , set up checkpoints and started intensive patrols to prevent ` ` infiltration activities on both sides . ''
International media organizations are largely banned from Syria , making it difficult to verify accounts of events there .
Assad , who trained as an ophthalmologist , has used a mixture of repression and promises of reform to stem the protests , which were inspired by uprisings across the Arab world .
The United States and the European Union have imposed targeted sanctions on Syrian officials and condemned the violence used to suppress dissent .
Authorities said Assad intended to launch national dialogue talks , an offer rejected by opposition leaders and the main activists ' protest group , who say security forces must first stop shooting protesters and political prisoners must be freed .
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters .
The question is how long will Obama administration will give Assad , I think until we have a civil war and it 's getting close because there is so much people can take .
Syrian people thought Turkey will not allowed the killing to happen
but I think we all were wrong after all , every one looking for its own interest .
Syrians will remember Russia & China position real well and once the regime is gone they will be gone with it ... .
