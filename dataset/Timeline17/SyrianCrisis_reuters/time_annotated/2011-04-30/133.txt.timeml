AMMAN -LRB-
Reuters -RRB- - Women and children in the besieged Syrian city of Deraa chanted ` ` God is greatest against the tyrant '' from rooftops in the night after troops backed by tanks intensified a crackdown on the city , a resident said .
Troops stormed into Deraa , cradle of a six - week - old uprising against President Bashar al - Assad 's authoritarian rule , <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2011-W16">a week ago</TIMEX3> to try to crush protests that have spread across the country of 20 million .
Power and communications have been disrupted .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2011-04-30">Saturday</TIMEX3> , tanks shelled the old quarter of the southern city and security forces stormed the Omari mosque , a focal point for protests .
` ` The shelling has intensified .
It is the worst night .
Women and children are on their rooftops chanting ` God is Greater ' against the tyrant , '' one resident , who lives in the Manshia neighborhood in the old quarter told Reuters by telephone .
He said security forces were entering homes and dragging men onto buses .
The chants echoed the calls of Iranian protesters who took to rooftops in Tehran chanting ` Allahu Akbar ' -LRB-
God is Greatest -RRB- during post - election unrest in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3> .

A Syrian rights group said at least 560 civilians have been killed in the six - week - old uprising in support of demands for greater political freedom and action against corruption that has flourished under the Baath Party , in power since <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="1963">1963</TIMEX3> .
The uprising , unthinkable only months ago , flared after mass protests toppled authoritarian leaders in Egypt and Tunisia .
Demonstrations spread in Bahrain and escalated to civil war in Libya .
Newly appointed Prime Minister Adel Safar was quoted by state news agency SANA as saying his government would in the <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">coming weeks</TIMEX3> draw up a ` ` complete plan '' of political , judicial and economic reforms .
The pledge was unlikely to dampen the intensity of protests .
A severe crackdown followed the once - unthinkable gesture of lifting <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="P1DE">a decades</TIMEX3> - old emergency law <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2011-04">this month</TIMEX3> .
