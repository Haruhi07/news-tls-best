The Red Cross is pressing Syrian authorities for wider access to thousands of detainees arrested in pro - democracy protests , while insisting that its own strict terms be met , its president said <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-11-02">Wednesday</TIMEX3> .

In an interview with Reuters , Jakob Kellenberger , president of the International Committee of the Red Cross -LRB- ICRC -RRB- , said that the independent humanitarian agency would assess its role after an upcoming visit to a detention center in Aleppo .
Syria opened its prisons for the first time in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011-09">September</TIMEX3> , allowing ICRC officials to visit Damascus central prison which has 6,000 inmates , but that is the only facility the Red Cross has seen .
Activists say 30,000 people have been arrested in the seven - month uprising against President Bashar al - Assad 's rule .
` ` I have always made clear , also when I was -LRB- there -RRB- again in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2011-09">September</TIMEX3> with President Assad that yes , that this is the test phase , a first phase , but after that we want to go further , '' Kellenberger said in an interview in his Geneva office .
` ` I would like to see <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> how the next visit will go , that would be Aleppo , in order to see a little bit if we have understood each other well , '' he added .
He declined to reveal specifics , but said that there were unresolved issues with Syrian authorities over the terms of ICRC visits .
The agreed initial phase of visits was limited to Damascus and Aleppo , he said .
` ` We will certainly have a thorough examination internally after this first phase on the merits of our visits , '' Kellenberger said .
` ` I have to say that the first visit has shown still that we need to talk to each other in much more detail '' about the terms of the visits , he said .
` ` Nobody has such -LRB- high -RRB- standards as we have , '' he said .
Under its standard terms worldwide , the ICRC demands full access to all detention centers , the right to interview prisoners of its choosing in private and to make follow - up visits .
Syria has agreed to withdraw its military presence from cities and residential areas and to releasing prisoners as part of an Arab initiative to end violence , the Arab League said in a statement <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2011-11-02">Wednesday</TIMEX3> .
It was not immediately clear how many prisoners might be affected by the move or the timetable of the release .
The United Nations says 3,000 people have been killed in what it calls ` ` ruthless repression '' of anti - government protesters that could drive the country into full - blown civil war .
Syrian army deserters killed seven soldiers and eight members of the security forces and gunmen loyal to President Assad in an apparent response to the killing of 11 villagers <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2011-11-02" mod="START">earlier Wednesday</TIMEX3> , an activist group said .
Activists say people have been rounded up and are being held in makeshift detention centers including schools .
` ` We have big concerns .

But I meant the fact is we are the only ones who are in a position , who are accepted to do this work , '' Kellenberger said .
` ` The big challenge is to try to see these people . ''
` ` I am aware that there will be places where it would be even more urgent that we can go than the places where we go <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> , '' he added .
Kellenberger also said that those wounded in the violence do not appear to have full access to medical treatment , as required under international humanitarian law .
The ICRC has previously said it had reports of doctors , ambulance workers and other health - care workers being prevented from performing their life - saving tasks of evacuating the wounded and providing first aid and medical care .
` ` One of the main reasons I went in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2011-09">September</TIMEX3> to see President Assad was to make clear that every person is entitled to access to medical care .
It was a major concern , in fact it was one of the elements triggering the visit , '' Kellenberger said .
` ` We have even talked about certain measures that have to be taken to make this access easier .
` ` But from the news I have , I do not have the impression that the problem is solved , unfortunately ...
Everything indicates it remains a big problem , '' he said .
