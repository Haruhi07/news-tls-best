China and Vietnam have hurled accusations at each other for weeks over what each sees as intrusions into its territorial waters by the other in a swath of ocean crossed by key shipping lanes and thought to hold large deposits of oil and gas .
Such accusations are not uncommon between China , Vietnam and the Philippines , Malaysia , Brunei and Taiwan , which are also involved in long - standing maritime disputes in the South China Sea , but this bout of tension has run longer than usual .
The senior navy source , who declined to be identified , said the naval drills were ` ` routine , '' pre - planned and not related to the territorial disputes .
` ` We should n't pay too much attention to them so as to not add to the tension .
They 're not aimed at confronting any country , '' said the source , who declined to be identified .
He declined to confirm that the drills were under way .
An article in the Vietnamese newspaper People 's Army on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-06-12">Sunday</TIMEX3> blamed China for creating disputes ` ` through provocative actions , hostilities aimed at its neighbors and threats to the interests of maritime navigation of other countries -LRB- that -RRB- will not bring good results for China .

China has denied that its ships have done anything wrong .
In Washington , a key Democratic lawmaker on Asia policy said he would introduce a U.S. Senate resolution urging China to cease military actions and enter into multilateral talks on maritime territorial disputes with its neighbors .
` ` We need to send a very clear signal to the Chinese , '' said Senator Jim Webb , chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations East Asian and Pacific Affairs Subcommittee .
` ` We need to do our part as a balancing force to bring these issues to the table , '' he said in a speech at a think tank .
Washington must ` ` back up what we said '' <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2010">last year</TIMEX3> , when Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stressed U.S. support for a collective regional solution to the mosaic of territorial disputes in the South China Sea , Webb added .
Computer hackers on both sides of the border have taken matters into their own hands , according to media accounts , posting pro - China or pro - Vietnam messages on scores of the other country 's websites , including some belonging to the government .

''
