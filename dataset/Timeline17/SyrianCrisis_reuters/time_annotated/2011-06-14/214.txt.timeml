BEIJING , <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2011-06-14">June 14</TIMEX3> -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - China opposes external powers weighing in on territorial disputes in the South China Sea , it said on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-06-14">Tuesday</TIMEX3> after Vietnam said other countries , including the United States , could help defuse tensions over the potentially resource - rich region Vietnam outlined the terms of a possible military draft , a move that experts called a signal meant to show the country was prepared to defend its interests , but Beijing 's warning appeared aimed at Washington , which urged a collective solution to the sea tensions <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010">last year</TIMEX3> .
` ` We hope that countries that are not parties to the South China Sea dispute truly respect the efforts of the countries concerned to resolve their disputes through consultation , '' Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said .
China 's main military newspaper was blunter .
` ` China resolutely opposes any country unrelated to the South China Sea issue meddling in disputes , and it opposes the internationalisation of the South China Sea issue , '' said a commentary in the Liberation Army Daily .
China 's statements coincided with naval exercises by Vietnam 's military along its central coast , and followed <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P1WE">a weekend</TIMEX3> statement by Hanoi welcoming efforts by the international community , including the United States , to help resolve the maritime disputes .
China and Vietnam have traded accusations for weeks over what each sees as intrusions into its territorial waters by the other in a stretch of ocean spanned by key shipping lanes and thought to hold large deposits of oil and gas .
Beijing has said it is not to blame .
` ` The <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> developments in the South China Sea were the result of unilateral actions by some countries that damaged China 's sovereignty and maritime rights , '' spokesman Hong said .
` ` China has been protecting its legitimate rights and not violating those of other countries . ''
Accusations of unlawful intrusions in the South China Sea are not uncommon between China , Vietnam and the Philippines , Malaysia , Brunei and Taiwan , but this bout of tension has run longer than usual .
Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung signed a decree on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2011-06-13">Monday</TIMEX3> listing the types of cases which would be exempt in the event of a military draft in time of war .
The decree takes effect from <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2011-08-01">Aug. 1</TIMEX3> .
` ` Vietnam is speaking to two audiences , '' Carlyle Thayer , a Vietnam expert at the Australian Defense Force Academy , told Reuters .
` ` It 's speaking to a domestic audience where it is under pressure to be shown to be taking steps to deal with China .
The other is to China . ''
China 's latest comments were in response to those from a key U.S. Democratic lawmaker on Asia policy , Senator Jim Webb , who said on <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2011-06-13">Monday</TIMEX3> he would introduce a resolution urging China to enter into multilateral talks on maritime territorial disputes with its neighbors .
Tension between China and the United States intensified <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2010">last year</TIMEX3> after the Obama administration became embroiled in the South China Sea dispute by stressing Washington 's support for a collective solution .
<TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2011">This year</TIMEX3> , Sino - U.S relations have steadied , and Washington has so far been more muted about the issue .
Beijing insists on handling the disputes on a one - on - one basis rather than multilaterally , a strategy some critics have described as ` ` divide and conquer '' .
A Vietnamese military source confirmed the live - fire drills were under way .
Vietnam 's military newspaper accused China at <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2011-W23-WE">the weekend</TIMEX3> of creating disputes ` ` through provocative actions -LRB- and -RRB- hostilities aimed at its neighbors '' .
