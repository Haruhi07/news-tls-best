ASCOT , England | Tue <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-06-14">Jun 14 , 2011</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2011-06-14T18:12">6:12 pm</TIMEX3> BST ASCOT , England -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Canford Cliffs denied globetrotting mare Goldikova a 14th Group One victory and staked his claim to be Europe 's top miler when he outbattled the French raider to win the Queen Anne Stakes at Royal Ascot <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-06-14">Tuesday</TIMEX3> .
Jockey Richard Hughes rode a supremely confident race , sitting at the back in the early stages before producing Canford Cliffs , the 11 - <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="PT8S">8 second</TIMEX3> favorite , to challenge inside the final furlong .
The four - year - old secured his fourth Group One triumph , producing his renowned turn of foot to win by a length from 5 - 4 favorite Goldikova .
Victory was sweet compensation for trainer Richard Hannon , whose Paco Boy was beaten by a neck by Goldikova in the race <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010">last year</TIMEX3> .
` ` These sort of horses do n't come along very often , '' said Hannon , father - in - law of the winning jockey .
` ` He had a good lead from Goldikova and Hughsie did n't lose sight of her .
Thankfully when it came to it he was able to go by her .
It 's a shame really for anyone to beat the mare as she 's been so good but someone has to take her on . ''
It was a third consecutive win at Royal Ascot for Canford Cliffs having won the Coventry Stakes in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010">last year</TIMEX3> 's St James 's Palace Stakes .
Goldikova , who completed an unprecedented third Breeders ' Cup Mile triumph in the United States in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2010-11">November</TIMEX3> , was also given a rousing reception by racegoers on her return to the paddock on a warm and sunny afternoon .
` ` I was thrilled with that .
The people here know a champion , '' said trainer Freddy Head .
` ` I think she ran a top , top race and is as good as ever . ''
Britain 's Queen Elizabeth unveiled a statue of four - time Ascot Gold Cup winner Yeats in the parade ring before the start of the Royal meeting with the racecourse commemorating <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="P300Y">300 years</TIMEX3> of racing in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3> .
The Queen suffered disappointment as an owner <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2011-06" mod="START">earlier this month</TIMEX3> when her Carlton House , favorite for the Epsom Derby , could only finish third .
That race was bypassed by Henry Cecil 's Frankel because of stamina doubts and the colt had to dig deep to extend his unbeaten record to seven races , holding on to win the St James 's Palace Stakes from the fast closing Zoffany .
Frankel 's workmanlike victory was a stark contrast to his scintillating English 2,000 Guineas win <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2011-05">last month</TIMEX3> and 68 - year - old Cecil , awarded a knighthood <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2011-W23">last week</TIMEX3> , breathed a sigh of relief after celebrating his 73rd Royal Ascot success .
` ` That was a bit nerve - wracking and it did n't go to plan , '' said Cecil after the 30 - 100 favorite held by three - quarters of a length after tiring in the closing stages of the one mile contest .
` ` He looked as if he was going to win a bit more easily and I think he thought that he had just done enough .
The horse is a gentleman but complicated '' Zoffany 's Irish trainer Aidan O'Brien gained swift compensation when 4 - 1 favorite Power won the Coventry Stakes while Prohibit , a well - backed 7 - 1 chance , handed British trainer Robert Cowell and jockey Jim Crowley a first Royal Ascot success .
In a helter - skelter five furlong dash to the King 's Stand Stakes , Prohibit fended off Australian - trained Star Witness -LRB- 6 - 1 -RRB- and Sweet Sanette -LRB- 16 - 1 -RRB- , trained in Hong Kong .
Hungarian sprinter Overdose , known as the ` ` Budapest Bullet , '' was in the front rank for much of the race but faded to finish fourth .
