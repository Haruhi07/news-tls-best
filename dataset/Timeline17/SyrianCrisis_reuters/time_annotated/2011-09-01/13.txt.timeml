` ` Volatility is quite good for business ...
I think a lot of people become very disillusioned with where they are investing , '' Peter Hargreaves , co founder and the firm 's largest shareholder , said in an interview .
The company said its assets under administration expanded 41 percent to 24.6 billion pounds in the year through <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2011-06">June</TIMEX3> , outpacing a forecast of 37 percent growth by analysts at brokerage Collins Stewart Hargreaves Lansdown -LRB- HRGV .
