TOKYO , <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2011-09-14">Sept 14</TIMEX3> -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Japan 's top golfer Ryo Ishikawa has been fined $ 26,000 for pulling out of two tournaments in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2011-08">August</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-09">September</TIMEX3> , the JGTO Tour said on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-09-14">Wednesday</TIMEX3> .
The 19 - year - old withdrew from the Kansai Open and <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2011-W36">last week</TIMEX3> 's Toshin tournament , which he missed for the second year running , citing a sore shoulder .

But Japan 's JGTO Tour took a dim view of Ishikawa 's decision to pull out again and slapped him with the first such fines for <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P3Y">three years</TIMEX3> on the men 's tour as punishment .
` ` Rules are rules , '' the tour 's executive director Andy Yamanaka told Reuters .
` ` They are put in place to protect the tournaments .
They are not rules only for Ryo . ''
Yamanaka insisted the Japanese tour would not make any special concessions to Ishikawa 's enormous celebrity in Japan , where his grinning face looks down from giant billboards and appears frequently on TV commercials .
` ` Yes he 's a superstar
but he is also one of 200 -LRB- JGTO -RRB- members and everyone plays under one set of rules .
You should not change rules for one person . ''
JGTO chairman Tadashi Koizumi said the organization would ` ` get tough '' <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2012">next year</TIMEX3> to tighten the rules and prevent players suddenly pulling out of tournaments .
` ` We want the players to support the Japanese tournaments , '' said Yamanaka .
` ` They ca n't just pay money and take time off , so we want to amend the rulebook .
` ` Even if Ishikawa goes off and plays on the American PGA Tour he will still have to abide by our rules . ''
Ishikawa apologised and produced a doctor 's note .
` ` My left shoulder felt like it was about to dislocate , '' Japan 's brightest hope for a future men 's major champion told the Nikkan Sports .
` ` The doctor told me if I played on , it would develop into chronic inflammation so I made the tough decision to withdraw .
` ` <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010">Last year</TIMEX3> I was playing in Europe so had to pull out .
It 's bad timing . ''
