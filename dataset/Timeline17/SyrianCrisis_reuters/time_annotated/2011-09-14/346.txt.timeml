LONDON | We d <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2011-09-14">Sep 14 , 2011</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="TIME" value="2011-09-14T16:21">4:21 pm</TIMEX3> BST LONDON -LRB-
Reuters -RRB- - Somali pirate attacks are expected to surge in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">coming weeks</TIMEX3> after a monsoon abates , but defense cuts will undermine international efforts to fight them , a senior European Union navy official said on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2011-09-14">Wednesday</TIMEX3> .
Pirate attacks on oil tankers and other ships are costing the world economy billions of dollars <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> and navies have struggled to combat the menace , especially in the vast expanses of the Indian Ocean .
` ` The general trend for navies around the world is for them to have gone through a strategic defense review or something similar and emerged with either no more or in many situations less ships , '' said Captain Keith Blount , chief of staff with EUNAVFOR , the bloc 's counter - piracy naval mission off Somalia .
` ` Balancing priorities is very difficult for governments and counter - piracy I am afraid has to fight for its place in that list of priorities , '' he told Reuters in an interview .
Naval patrols , including vessels from the European Union , the United States , South Korea , Iran and other nations have curbed the number of attacks in the Gulf of Aden , though not in the Indian Ocean .
Attacks have also slowed in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P2M">the past two months</TIMEX3> due to poor weather conditions .
` ` I think we are going to see a surge in piracy because we always have done at this time when the southwest monsoon abates and the seas become flatter , '' Blount said .
` ` Typically the pirates have a really good go in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2011-FA">the autumn</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2011-WI">winter</TIMEX3> , '' he said on the sidelines of a shipping conference .
Blount said there were ` ` conflicting priorities with other real military activity '' in the Middle East , North Africa and other arenas .
` ` It is the challenge of industry and the military involved in counter - piracy to lobby governments to try and see piracy as a higher priority than it is , '' he told the conference .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent days</TIMEX3> a French woman seized by pirates was freed after a Spanish navy patrol boat fought a fierce gun battle off the Somali coast .
Blount said the military wanted to be able to operate closer to the coasts of Yemen and Eritrea .
He said navies were <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> only allowed to tackle piracy on the high seas , outside territorial waters , according to the terms of a U.N. convention .
` ` There is diplomatic activity to try and allow us have a little bit more freedom to operate in those areas , '' he said .
` ` Because we believe the same people are involved , we would like dearly to be able to get in there and get stuck in . ''
The shipping industry , some of whose members already employ private guards , says better armed and increasingly violent seaborne gangs pose a growing threat to vital sea lanes .
Blount said the military was ` ` completely agnostic '' on private armed guards , and nations , flag states and the industry had to be clear on whether they backed using contractors .
` ` I think a ship with private security onboard will be taken successfully by pirates -- it is a matter of time , '' he said .
The industry <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2011-W36">last week</TIMEX3> urged the United Nations to create an armed military force to be deployed on vessels to tackle Somali piracy .
` ` The <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> military response -- with only a handful of navy ships available to provide protection on any given day -- has just been a sticking plaster on a gaping wound , '' said International Chamber of Shipping chairman Spyros Polemis .
` ` Governments have so far failed to protect shipping , and the smooth flow of world trade , from being literally held to ransom by Somali criminals , '' he said on <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2011-09-14">Wednesday</TIMEX3> .
