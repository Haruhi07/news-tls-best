For Sudanese worker Mohamed Taher , hunting for gold with a metal detector in the Nubian desert is a way to end years of unemployment .
` ` Sometimes I find one to four ounces , sometimes nothing .

But if I find something it will cover all my expenses , '' says Mohamed , who regularly camps out with friends to search for gold .
Like tens of thousands of other Sudanese , Mohamed has been lured by a gold rush in the remote northeast of the vast country , where experts say large amounts of valuable minerals may lie buried .
Some government officials estimate 200,000 people or more may have taken part in the rush since <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010">last year</TIMEX3> .
Mohamed 's home village , Bir Ajam , is located some 30 kilometers -LRB- 20 miles -RRB- from the Hassai mine ,
Sudan 's biggest , in the mountainous desert hinterland of the Red Sea city of Port Sudan .
The venture which runs the mine , Ariab Mining Co , in which the Sudanese government holds a majority stake and Canada 's La Mancha Resources LMA .
TO owns 40 percent , is investing millions of dollars to expand gold output and look for other minerals such as copper .
The gold fever is spreading some wealth to one of Sudan 's poorest regions , where nomadic life for much of the population has changed little from centuries ago .
Lured by record international gold prices above $ 1,600 an ounce , villagers like Mohamed search for gold on the outskirts of the Hassai mine .
Hundreds of others work in the mine itself .
A mining industry conference <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2011-10">this month</TIMEX3> in Port Sudan , the country 's first in decades , attracted dozens of foreign executives and experts -- a rare sight in a country shunned by most Western firms because of U.S. sanctions imposed <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="200X" mod="MORE_THAN">over a decade ago</TIMEX3> amid charges that Sudan sponsored terrorism .
` ` Sudan represents one of the last remaining African countries that has significant gold potential and has not been subject of intense , systematic exploration in the modern era , '' Howard Bills of the British - based mining firm Toro Gold told the conference .
The Nubian desert has been a source of gold since the time of the Egyptian pharaohs , but only in <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DURATION" value="PXY">the past few years</TIMEX3> has the government stepped up exploration efforts .
Sudan hopes an expansion of gold exports will bring in much - needed foreign currency and compensate for oil revenues lost with the secession of the south of the country in <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2011-07">July this year</TIMEX3> .
Before the split , the country produced about 500,000 barrels of oil <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> and earned around $ 5 billion from oil exports <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="SET" value="XXXX">annually</TIMEX3> ; secession meant the north lost some 75 percent of that .
Annual inflation was 21 percent in <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2011-09">September</TIMEX3> , partly because the loss of oil revenues has caused the Sudanese pound to depreciate in the black market , driving up the cost of food and other imported goods .
The government has handed out almost 100 new gold exploration licences to foreign and local firms in <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">the past 12 months</TIMEX3> , bringing the total number of outstanding licences to about 200 .
` ` Sudan is <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3> high on the list globally in terms of the likelihood of gold discoveries , '' said Tucker Barrie , a Canadian mining expert who regular visits Sudan 's industry .
` ` I see it as pretty positive ...
There will be more discoveries . ''
However , mining industry executives warn it will take years to build up gold output as only about three mining firms have started production -- the rest are still exploring .
The government predicts gold output will reach as much as 70 tonnes <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="2011">this year</TIMEX3> and bring in $ 3 billion of revenue , potentially making Sudan the third largest gold producer in Africa , after South Africa and Ghana and before Mali .
But the executives say that goal is well out of reach for <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> .
` ` I think if they make 20 to 30 percent of the $ 3 billion , that would be good , '' said a managing director of a Sudanese mining firm , declining to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue .
The official target is ` ` way too optimistic '' .
Even the mining ministry admits that only 7 tonnes will be produced from mines such as Hassai ; the rest is projected to come from ` ` artisanal '' seekers like Mohamed , whose success is hard to track .

A foreign mining expert working in Sudan said 4 tonnes of gold from mines would be a realistic target for <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3> .
Another obstacle is the U.S. trade embargo , which deters many Western firms from getting involved , leaving the field mainly to local or Chinese companies which may lack experience .
` ` It 's a bit of a hit and miss business with Sudanese firms .
Chinese firms are good at building mines but poor explorers , '' said a Western expert in exploration .
Also , few of the small entrepreneurs are selling their gold to the central bank ; much of their output ends up with traders who smuggle it to Dubai or other major gold markets .
As a result , Sudan made only $ 1.1 billion from gold exports in <TIMEX3 tid="t38" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3> .
<TIMEX3 tid="t39" type="DATE" value="2011">This year</TIMEX3> might see a modest increase due to a higher gold price , but revenues will be way below $ 3 billion , experts say .
The government is offering incentives to persuade unofficial seekers to sell their gold to the central bank , and plans to establish a refinery to enhance the value of gold products .
` ` You have to intervene to regulate the sector , '' said Abdelbagi Gailani , the minister of minerals .
Despite the problems , Sudan 's gold output is likely to rise continuously <TIMEX3 tid="t41" type="DURATION" value="PXY" mod="MORE_THAN">over the next few years</TIMEX3> , experts say .
Barrie estimated annual production could increase by a further 2.8 tonnes every <TIMEX3 tid="t43" type="DURATION" value="P3Y">three</TIMEX3> or <TIMEX3 tid="t42" type="DURATION" value="P4Y">four years</TIMEX3> as new mines came on stream .
Meanwhile , a ` ` significant profit '' from the unofficial output would eventually end up in government coffers if regulation improved .
Barrie said the gold rush had helped make the northeast one of the most stable regions in a country hit by insurgencies such as the rebellion in Darfur .
` ` We have benefited a lot from the gold mine .
The company built a health center , which you rarely find here , '' said Mohammed Mahmoud , another resident of Bir Ajam .
Under an expansion plan , the Hassai mine will build a pipeline from the Nile to obtain more water which engineers will use to drill deeper .
As a byproduct , villages on the way will be connected to the pipeline .
