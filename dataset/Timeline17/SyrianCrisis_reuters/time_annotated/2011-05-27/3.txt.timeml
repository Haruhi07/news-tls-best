Reuters -RRB- - Thousands of Egyptians packed Cairo 's Tahrir Square on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2011-05-27">Friday</TIMEX3> in what organisers called a ` ` second revolution '' to push for faster reforms and a speedy trial for ousted President Hosni Mubarak and his former aides .
Activists complain of delays in putting Mubarak , his family and members of his ousted regime on trial and that the army has not restored order quickly enough to the country of 80 million .
Egyptians are also demanding an end to endemic graft , one of the main grievances that drove thousands of protesters onto the streets in the uprising that began on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2011-01-25">January 25</TIMEX3> .
` ` After some 1,000 martyrs ...
people do not see any change , '' said Mustafa Ali Menshawi , a 38 - year - old accountant , who was helping marshal crowds flooding into the square .
` ` The only change we see is that the Mubarak metro station has been changed to the Martyrs station , '' he said .
In a move seen as aimed at appeasing protesters , authorities on <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2011-05-24">Tuesday</TIMEX3> ordered Mubarak to stand trial on charges of graft and ` ` pre - meditated killing '' of protesters during the uprising that ousted him on <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2011-02-11">February 11</TIMEX3> .
If convicted , Mubarak could face the death penalty .
He has been detained at a hospital in the tourist Red Sea resort of Sharm el - Sheikh since <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2011-04">April</TIMEX3> when he was reported to have suffered heart problems during an initial questioning .
Hundreds staged a protest in front of the hospital calling for his departure .
They said his presence was driving tourists away , according to state TV .
FLAGS , PLACARDS AND NO SOLDIERS
The ruling military council withdrew the army from near the protests in Cairo and has ordered security forces to stay away .
Tahrir Square was decked with Egyptian flags and placards demanding that officials who worked under Mubarak and squandered state funds be investigated .
` ` We want to dissolve all local councils that are famous for being the most and worst corrupt institutions during Mubarak 's regime , '' said Mohammed Adel , of the <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2011-04-06">April 6</TIMEX3> Youth group .
` ` We also ask that all political powers get involved in the drafting of important political laws , '' Adel added .
Thousands of Egyptians also took to the streets in the Mediterranean city of Alexandria and in the Suez Canal 's cities of Suez and Ismailia .
Smaller protests also took place in northern Sinai and in the city of Port Said on the Suez Canal .
However , some Egyptians expressed opposition to the protests , saying military rulers needed time to sort things out .
A few hundred gathered in Cairo 's al - Hussein area to express support for Egypt 's military rulers , chanting : ` ` For the sake of our country , we want to be ruled by the army . ''
Some political parties , including Egypt 's powerful Muslim Brotherhood , said no protests were needed and warned they could lead to confrontations between the army and demonstrators .
The absence of the Brotherhood angered some protesters , some of whom chanted : ` ` Where is the Brotherhood ? ''
The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces , in a Facebook message posted on <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2011-05-26">Thursday</TIMEX3> , called on protesters to exercise caution on <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2011-05-27">Friday</TIMEX3> , saying there were ` ` suspicious elements trying to take actions that would sow strife between Egypt 's people and the military .
