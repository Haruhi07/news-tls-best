Reuters -RRB- - Japan looks set to commit itself to talks on a U.S.-led free trade pact at the Asia - Pacific summit in Hawaii <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-W45-WE">this weekend</TIMEX3> , to help ties with the United States and tap into the region 's strong growth to revive its sluggish economy .
Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda has signalled he is leaning towards joining the Trans - Pacific Partnership -LRB- TPP -RRB- negotiations despite fierce opposition from many in his own party and the politically powerful farming sector .
For Noda , who became Japan 's sixth premier in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P5Y">five years</TIMEX3> in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011-09">September</TIMEX3> , the pact is the first big test whether he can take tough decisions , preserve party unity and avoid alienating the opposition , whose cooperation he needs in a divided parliament .
The TPP would in principle eliminate all tariffs within the zone , likely helping Japan 's auto and electronics exporters to better compete in the global market but hitting hard its agricultural industry , which has been protected by high tariffs on farm imports .
` ` This is a step that needs to be taken sooner or later if one thinks about Japan 's economic future , '' Mikitaka Masuyama , professor at National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies .
` ` But most noticeable effects in the short term will be negative ones such as damages to the farming sector .
Few would praise him for his decision . ''
Free trade is expected to top the agenda of the <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2011-11-12">November 12</TIMEX3> - <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2011-11-13">13</TIMEX3> summit in Honolulu , where leaders will also discuss a green growth initiative , which would cut tariffs on environmental goods and services such as solar panels and wind turbines .
In an effort to appease farmers , Noda 's government <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2011-10">last month</TIMEX3> unveiled a plan to strengthen Japan 's agriculture by consolidating typically tiny patches of farmland into bigger farms that can withstand foreign competition .
` ` If we give the reform enough time , Japan 's agriculture can be stronger .
A growing number of wealthy consumers in Asia will be buying Japan 's high - quality farm products , '' said Hisashi Yamada , chief economist at Japan Research Institute .
The TPP was launched in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2006">2006</TIMEX3> as an free trade initiative among Singapore , New Zealand , Chile and Brunei .
In addition to the four original members and the United States , talks have also been joined by Australia , Malaysia , Peru and Vietnam .
If Tokyo joined the pact , Japan and the United States would account for more than 90 percent of the total GDP within the TPP countries .
` ` Some people may say this is going to be a U.S.-Japan free trade agreement in disguise .

But Southeast Asian markets are the ones that will expand rapidly as we go forward , '' National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies ' Masuyama said .
With its population shrinking and greying , Japan needs to look overseas for growth .
But its society is split down the middle on the trade pact .
A survey by Kyodo news agency <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2011-11" mod="START">earlier this month</TIMEX3> showed 38 percent backed Japan 's participation in the pact , while 36 percent opposed it .
Its proponents say it is crucial to join the talks <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">as soon as possible</TIMEX3> , so that Japan can better protect its interest , for example by seeking an exemption for rice , Japan 's staple diet .
` ` When it comes to rice , Japan can not easily open up its market 100 percent .
Just like the United States is aiming to make sugar an exception , there is a good chance that Japan can make rice an exception , '' said Tomoaki Iwai , professor at Nihon University .
Japan <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> imposes 778 percent tariff on imported rice to protect typically small - scaled domestic rice farmers .
