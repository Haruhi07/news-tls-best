Reuters -RRB- - Guatemala on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-08-02">Tuesday</TIMEX3> sentenced four soldiers to 6,060 years of prison each , in the first conviction for a massacre during the country 's brutal 36 - year civil war .
More than 200 people were killed when Guatemalan soldiers attacked the northern village of Las Dos Erres in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="1982">1982</TIMEX3> at the height of Guatemala 's civil war .
The soldiers were given <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P30Y">30 years</TIMEX3> of prison for the deaths of each of the 201 killed in the attack .
The court also found them guilty of crimes against human rights , adding another <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P30Y">30 years</TIMEX3> to their sentences .
The soldiers -- Carlos Carias , Manuel Pop , Reyes Collin Gualip and Daniel Martinez Hernandez -- were all special forces officers at the time of the massacre .

The officers , in an elite unit known as the Kaibiles , went to the village in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="1982-12">December 1982</TIMEX3> and shot , strangled and bludgeoned the villagers to death with sledgehammers .
Guatemala 's Public Ministry said the army ordered the unit to the village to look for missing military weapons , believed to be in the hands of left - wing guerillas .
<TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2011-07">Last month</TIMEX3> , the United States deported former Guatemalan soldier Pedro Pimentel Rios , 54 , for his alleged role in the Las Dos Erres massacre .
Guatemala 's Public Ministry will hold a separate hearing for Rios .
The ruling center - left administration of President Alvaro Colom has been under pressure by human rights organizations to bring war criminals to justice in Guatemala , one of the poorest and most lawless countries in Latin America .
Nearly a quarter of a million people were killed in Guatemala 's <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="1960">1960</TIMEX3> - <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="1996">1996</TIMEX3> civil war and many thousands are still missing .
