ANKARA | Sun <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2011-06-12">Jun 12 , 2011</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="TIME" value="2011-06-12T15:12">3:12 pm</TIMEX3> EDT ANKARA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Turkey has put huge effort into improving ties with its neighbors in the Middle East but the unrest in Syria may force a rethinking of its foreign policy <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> that <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011-06-12">Sunday</TIMEX3> 's election is out of the way .
Turkey 's ` ` zero problems with neighbors '' policy has made Ankara into a regional power and Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan a hero in the Arab street .
But with more than 5,000 Syrian refugees fleeing across the border to escape a crackdown by President Bashar al - Assad , the long - time NATO member and European Union - candidate is reminded of the awkward position it has put itself in trying to champion democracy while befriending the region 's autocratic leaders .
Erdogan , who won a third consecutive term in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2011-06-12">Sunday</TIMEX3> 's election , has stepped up his criticism of Assad after having embraced him in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent years</TIMEX3> .
` ` The whole policy of warming up to Syria has collapsed , '' said Semih Idiz , a foreign policy expert for Milliyet daily .
` ` After the elections I expect Turkey to reevaluate its Middle East policy .
It has not brought the results expected . ''
Other ` ` Arab <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2011-SP">Spring</TIMEX3> '' uprisings have tested Turkey 's ability to look after its new interests , but Syria -- an Iranian ally with a volatile ethnic and religious mix lying in a web of regional conflicts -- poses particular challenges .
While Turkey has urged Assad to implement reforms and has added its voice to growing international condemnation by calling the crackdown ` ` inhumane , savage repression , '' Iran has supported the Syrian regime .
Ankara and Tehran , which have also forged closer ties in <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent years</TIMEX3> , compete for influence in Damascus .
` ` The Syrian crisis has the potential to make ties between Ankara and Tehran frostier .

If Iran or -LRB- Lebanon 's Shi'ite group -RRB- Hezbollah get involved in Syrian affairs Turkey will have to tell foreign powers to stay out , '' Idiz said .
Meanwhile the Syrians seeking refuge in Turkey are delighted by the decision to keep the country 's doors open to them -- around 300 Syrians in the border area cheered and shouted ` ` Long live Erdogan '' on hearing of his election win on <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2011-06-12">Sunday</TIMEX3> .
Some analysts say Turkey has been turning away from the West under Erdogan over <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="200">the past decade</TIMEX3> .
<TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2010">Last year</TIMEX3> , 22 percent of Turkey 's exports went to the Middle East and North Africa , double the share in <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2004">2004</TIMEX3> .
While Turkey 's bid for membership of the European Union has dragged on since formal negotiations began in <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2005">2005</TIMEX3> , Ankara has pursued free - trade accords with Jordan , Lebanon , Syria and Iraq .
In Libya , where Turkey had ventures worth $ 15.3 billion before an uprising against Muammar Gaddafi began in <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2011-02">February</TIMEX3> , Turkish firms were forced to leave projects unfinished .
Turkey has held joint military exercises and joint cabinet meetings with Syria and has abolished visa requirements , but those agreements might <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> be scaled down .
Erdogan , whose country quietly hosted a conference of Syrian opposition figures <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2011-W22">last week</TIMEX3> , has said that after <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2011-06-12">Sunday</TIMEX3> 's vote Ankara would talk to Assad in a ` ` very different manner . ''
Hugh Pope , an analyst at International Crisis Group , said events in Syria have shown the limits of Turkey 's policy and exposed the reality that Ankara has little leverage convincing Assad to change .
` ` Turkey is terribly frustrated at Assad , but I do n't think any country has any leverage in Syria at this point .
The regime is in a survival mode , '' Pope said .
However , he said Turkey 's close business and people 's ties might give it some leverage in the future .
The wars in neighboring Iraq brought refugees and severely disrupted trade with Turkey , but <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> Turkish firms are busy doing brisk businesses in Iraq .
` ` Whatever happens in Syria Turkey will adapt . ''
Turkey was caught off guard at the time of the <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="1991">1991</TIMEX3> Gulf War , when 500,000 people flooded across the border from northern Iraq , but this time has started early preparing for a possible mass influx of Syrian refugees .
When the <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2003">2003</TIMEX3> invasion of Iraq was being planned , Turks made arrangements to set up a buffer zone inside Iraq to look after any refugees on Iraqi soil .
In the event , only around 10,000 came .
Some media have reported that Turkish political and military officials are considering a similar zone in the Syria case if the number of refugees increases sharply , but officials have told Reuters they are not aware of such plans .
When asked about the possibility , Defense Minister Vecdi Gonul told reporters : ` ` It 's not on the agenda <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3> . ''
Damascus would not welcome the prospect of Turkish boots on Syrian soil .
Turkey and Syria went to the brink of war in <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="1998">1998</TIMEX3> when Ankara exerted pressure on Damascus to expel Kurdistan Workers Party -LRB- PKK -RRB- rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan who was sheltered there .
The expulsion and capture of Ocalan resolved the crisis .
