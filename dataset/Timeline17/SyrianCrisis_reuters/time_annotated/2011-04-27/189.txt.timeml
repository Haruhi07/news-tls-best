GELSENKIRCHEN , Germany | We d <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-04-27">Apr 27 , 2011</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="TIME" value="2011-04-27T08:12">8:12 am</TIMEX3> BST GELSENKIRCHEN , Germany -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Schalke 04 are in need of a minor miracle if they are to have any hope of advancing past Manchester United to the Champions League final after slumping to a 2 - 0 home defeat without as much as a fight .
It is not so much <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2011-04-26">Tuesday</TIMEX3> 's 2 - 0 first leg loss that leaves them facing a mountain to climb in Manchester 's ` ` theater of dreams '' but the lack of belief they can turn the tie around against a team that could have easily won by five goals .
The fact that Schalke had not lost any of their last nine Champions League matches before <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011-04-26">Tuesday</TIMEX3> and won all of their five previous home games in the competition makes their work in Manchester even more difficult .
` ` Our starting position <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> certainly points to Manchester having the advantage but in football you never know , '' Schalke coach Ralf Rangnick said .
The German coach , who took <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2011-W12" mod="MORE_THAN">over five weeks ago</TIMEX3> from Felix Magath said this short time had not been enough to bind his players into a unit capable of seriously challenging the three - time European champions .
` ` Manchester were on a different level than Inter Milan -LRB- in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2011-Q2">the quarter</TIMEX3> - finals -RRB- .
We reached our limits .
We will certainly need a wonder to progress , '' he said .
Schalke , 10th in the Bundesliga with no real chance of playing in the Champions League next season , take on Bayern Munich on <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2011-W16-WE">the weekend</TIMEX3> hoping a win could restore some of their lost confidence after United ripped their defense to shreds for <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="PT1H">over an hour</TIMEX3> in a one - sided game .
` ` We will not give up in the second leg but the result is pretty clear , '' said goalkeeper Manuel Neuer who prevented an embarrassingly high - score defeat with half a dozen superb saves .
His performance was the solitary Schalke highlight , prompting United coach Sir Alex Ferguson to label it the best by any goalkeeper against United in his years in charge .
To have any chance in the return leg Schalke need more than just an in - form Neuer .
They must beat United at home , with Manchester having yet to lose this season in the entire competition , let alone at home .
` ` Why should we capitulate ? ''
` ` We need to make things differently and in football many things have happened .
We have shown we can score away from home and we will try to get our chances in Manchester . ''
