Reuters -RRB- - Russia rejected on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2011-09-12">Monday</TIMEX3> Western calls for wider sanctions on Syria over its violent crackdown on protests against President Bashar al - Assad , in which the United Nations said 2,600 people have been killed .
<TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="P1D">A day</TIMEX3> after France described the lack of a firm U.N. stance against Damascus as a scandal , President Dmitry Medvedev said <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> U.S. and European sanctions on Syria meant ` ` additional pressure <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> is absolutely not needed in this direction . ''
Russia and China , veto - wielding members of the United Nations Security Council , have resisted efforts by Washington and its European allies to step up the international response to Syria 's repression of <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="P6M" mod="LESS_THAN">nearly six months</TIMEX3> of protests .
Assad has reacted to the uprising , inspired by revolts which have toppled three North African leaders <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2011">this year</TIMEX3> , with military assaults on protest centers and mass arrests .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2011-09-12">Monday</TIMEX3> , residents and local activists said Syrian forces killed at least 15 villagers in raids in the countryside around Hama in what they said was one of the biggest military assaults since the uprising broke out .
At least 2,000 troops backed by dozens of armored vehicles fired machineguns at random and stormed several villages and towns in the al - Ghab Plain , agricultural land northwest of Hama , they said .
Residents and activists had reported earlier that several thousand soldiers and hundreds of armored vehicles had massed in <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="P1D">the last 24 hours</TIMEX3> in areas north of Hama which had seen large protests calling for Assad 's removal .
Syrian opposition group Sawasiah said on <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2011-09-11">Sunday</TIMEX3> 113 civilians had been killed in <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2011-W36">the last week</TIMEX3> , during which activists and diplomats say Syrian forces stepped up raids to detain protest coordinators .
Damascus blames armed groups for the violence .
Assad 's media adviser Bouthaina Shaaban , speaking on a trip to Moscow on <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2011-09-12">Monday</TIMEX3> , gave a lower death toll than the United Nations and said half of the fatalities were among security forces .
` ` According to our information , 700 people were killed on the side of the army and police and 700 on the side of the insurgents , '' Shaaban told reporters through a translator .
U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said the United Nations figure was based on ` ` reliable sources on the ground . ''
` ` The number of those killed since the onset of the unrest in mid - <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2011-03">March</TIMEX3> ... has <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> reached at least 2,600 , '' Pillay told the U.N. Human Rights Council .
She did not identify the sources .
Syria has barred Pillay 's investigation team and most foreign journalists from entering the country .
Syria had also repeatedly blocked U.N. efforts to get human rights monitors into the country , U.N. humanitarian affairs chief Valerie Amos said .
The United Nations on <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2011-09-12">Monday</TIMEX3> named a three - member panel of international experts to investigate human rights violations including possible crimes against humanity since the protests began .
Sergio Pinheiro of Brazil will lead the commission of inquiry , which the U.N. Human Rights Council agreed to set up <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2011-08">last month</TIMEX3> to probe arbitrary executions , excessive use of force and killings and report back by <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2010-11" mod="END">the end of November</TIMEX3> .
FRANCE WANTS ` ` CLEAR UN RESOLUTION '' France , Britain , the United States , Germany and Portugal have circulated a draft U.N. Security Council resolution that called for sanctions against Assad , influential relatives and close associates , but it met resistance from Russia and China .
` ` I think it 's a scandal not to have a clear position of the U.N. in such a terrible crisis , '' French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said on <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2011-09-11">Sunday</TIMEX3> .
` ` We think that the regime has lost its legitimacy .
We think that it 's too late to implement a level of reform .
We should adopt in New York a very clear resolution condemning the violence . ''
Medvedev said Russia believed any resolution must be ` ` tough but balanced , and addressed to both sides in Syria , '' and that it must not automatically lead to further sanctions because ` ` there is already a large number of sanctions against Syria . ''
Syrian demonstrators have demanded international protection to stop civilian killings , but there has been no hint in the West of any appetite for military action along the lines of the NATO bombing that helped topple Libya 's Muammar Gaddafi .
Intervention would be a daunting prospect in a country in the heart of the volatile Middle East .
Syria has three times Libya 's population , supports Palestinian and Lebanese militant groups and has a strong alliance with Iran .
It remains formally at war with Israel , retains influence in Lebanon and has a sizeable Kurdish minority in its east .
After talks in Damascus with Assad , Arab League chief Nabil Elaraby said they had agreed on a series of measures that he would present to league member states to help end the violence .
Assad has announced some reforms such as ending emergency law and launching a ` ` national dialogue . ''
Opponents say these have made little difference .
Among hundreds of Syrians arrested in <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent days</TIMEX3> was leading psychoanalyst Rafah Nashed , 66 , who has been treating people traumatized by the mounting repression , her friends said .
Syrian authorities do not comment on arrests but have said in the past that any arrests are made in accordance with the constitution .
