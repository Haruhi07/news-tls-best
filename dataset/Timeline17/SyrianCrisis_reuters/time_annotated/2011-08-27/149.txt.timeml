The overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi by Libyan rebels supported by NATO forces focuses international attention on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P5M">the five months</TIMEX3> of unrest in Syria , which has shaken one of the most tightly controlled Arab states .
Opposition figures and activists fear the successful use of force to topple Gaddafi may encourage Syrians to follow Libya 's example .
Syrian protests have been mainly peaceful but there have been increasing reports of attacks on security forces .
Upheaval in Syria would affect its allies and enemies in the volatile Middle East , and a softening in rhetoric from Arab countries <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2011-W34">this week</TIMEX3> indicated they might still be prepared to support President Bashar al - Assad if he implements reform .
Following are some possible scenarios in Syria and the risks and opportunities they would present : The United Nations says 2,200 people have been killed in Assad 's crackdown on dissent since protests broke out in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2011-03">March</TIMEX3> .
Syria says over 500 soldiers and police have been killed by armed groups which it blames for the violence .
Despite growing international condemnation , Western sanctions , and escalating economic pressures from the unrest , Assad 's rule shows no sign of imminent collapse .

Nor is there any indication that the protests across the country are about to stop , although the number of protesters appears to have fallen since Assad sent troops into several major cities earlier in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2011-08">August</TIMEX3> .
If Assad can not crush the protests completely , he may be able to contain their impact , staying in power despite the major upheaval and economic disruption caused by the unrest and growing international isolation .
STRIKING A DEAL WITH OPPOSITION Assad could reshuffle his ministers and bring in some opposition figures in a symbolic move that will not stop street demonstrations but may convince some that he is serious about reforms , including the promise of multi - party elections by <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2012-02">February</TIMEX3> .
After an apparently coordinated wave of criticism from regional powers including Saudi Arabia , Egypt and Turkey <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2011-08" mod="START">earlier this month</TIMEX3> , Arab states have moderated their language in <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent days</TIMEX3> , hinting at a possible easing of pressure on Assad .
Many opposition figures have dismissed Assad 's promise of political reform and said they can not talk to the authorities while the violence continues .

But if the deadlock continues , some members of the fractured opposition may feel there is no alternative to negotiation , despite the chasm of mistrust between the two sides .
So far no country has proposed carrying out in Syria the kind of intervention undertaken by NATO forces to help Libyan rebels topple Muammar Gaddafi .

But the collapse of Gaddafi 's rule has encouraged some Syrian opposition figures and protesters to support international intervention in Syria , including the idea of a Turkish buffer zone in northern Syria .
NATO help us , '' read one banner , in English , at a protest in the northern province of Idlib on <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2011-08-26">Friday</TIMEX3> .
But any military intervention could destabilize a region in which Assad enjoys strong support from Iran and backs militant groups like Hezbollah , Hamas and Islamic Jihad .
` ` Any negative or bad development will affect the whole region , '' Hezbollah Secretary - General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said on <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2011-08-26">Friday</TIMEX3> .
International intervention could also lead some Syrians to choose Assad over perceived foreign interference .
Analysts and some opposition activists have warned that the continuous killing may encourage people to take up arms in big numbers , pushing the country toward civil war .
` ` I fear that some in the opposition who are in a hurry to end the regime , who we have always warned against repeating the Libyan example , will say <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> it has been successful and resort to arms , '' said opposition figure Louay Hussein .
Assad belongs to the minority Alawite sect which makes up around ten percent of the Syrian population .
Most of the demonstrations are taking place in Sunni Muslim areas .
There have been sectarian killings in some cities including Homs , but activists say so far it has been a minor part of the unrest .
Syria suffered repeated coups in <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DATE" value="196">the 1960s</TIMEX3> before Assad 's father , Hafez al - Assad , seized power in <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="1970">1970</TIMEX3> and purged his opponents from positions of power .
Despite reports of some low - level defections , and Assad 's replacement of his defense minister at the height of the military crackdown in <TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="DATE" value="2011-08">August</TIMEX3> , the army has so far stood behind the president , unlike in the Tunisian and Egyptian revolutions .
But some activists see little prospect of Assad being toppled by street demonstrations and see a military coup as the best chance of removing him .
They hope Western calls for Assad to step down and targeted sanctions against senior officials might encourage those around the president to break away or carry out a coup to avoid prosecution .
It is not clear how any new military leaders would deal with protesters ' demands for greater political freedoms .
Attention has also focused on the wealthy merchant classes of Damascus and Aleppo which have made no public move yet to disassociate themselves from Assad .

Unless they feel their interests would be protected in a post - Assad Syria , they would be reluctant to push for revolutionary change .
But their patience may be tested as the economy reels from the collapse of tourism revenues and foreign investment , loss of trade and a fall in manufacturing output .
