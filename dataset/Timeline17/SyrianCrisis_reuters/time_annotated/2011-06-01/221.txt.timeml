Reuters -RRB- - Months of political paralysis and a crisis in neighboring Syria have harmed Lebanon 's security , a senior U.N. official said on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-06-01">Wednesday</TIMEX3> , days after a bomb attack wounded six U.N. peacekeepers .
Special Coordinator for Lebanon Michael Williams said the attack , which followed the kidnapping of seven Estonians and a deadly incident <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011-05">last month</TIMEX3> on the Israeli border , was part of an ` ` eroding and deteriorating '' security situation .
Lebanon has been without a proper functioning government since <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2011-01">January</TIMEX3> when the Syrian - and Iranian - backed Hezbollah and its political allies brought down the government of Prime Minister Saad al - Hariri , who has Western and Saudi support .
Efforts to form a government have made little progress and the 10 - week unrest in Syria has escalated tensions .
Damascus ended a prolonged military presence in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2005">2005</TIMEX3> , but remains a powerful player in a country still defined by the political and religious faultlines which fueled its <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="1975">1975</TIMEX3> - <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="1990">1990</TIMEX3> civil war .
` ` We see signs of the security situation deteriorating in general , and disturbingly that the institutions of the state are not responding in the way that they should , '' Williams told Reuters at his U.N. office in the hills above Beirut .
He said the main concern was a political vacuum caused by the lack of government .
Although Lebanese are accustomed to protracted wrangling over new cabinets , the <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> impasse was unusually fraught and likely to drag on for months , he said .
` ` The risk is greater <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> .
One , because of the absence of a government .
Two , because of the crisis in Syria .
And three , because there is some fragility <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> along the Blue Line -LRB- U.N.-mapped frontier with Israel -RRB- . ''
The Israeli army fired on a demonstration at the Lebanese border village of Maroun al - Ras <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2011-W20">two weeks ago</TIMEX3> , killing 11 Palestinians marking the ` ` catastrophe '' <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="1948">63 years ago</TIMEX3> of the founding of Israel , security sources said .
Similar protests may take place on <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2011-05-29">Sunday</TIMEX3> 's anniversary of the <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="1967">1967</TIMEX3> war when Israel seized the Golan Heights and West Bank .
Seven Estonians are still missing after being seized in Lebanon 's Bekaa Valley after crossing the border from Syria in <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2011-03">March</TIMEX3> , in a kidnapping which Williams and EU envoy Angelina Eichorst described as a dark reminder of Lebanon 's civil war .
In another sign of fraying authority , rival security forces came close to confrontation <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2011-W21">last week</TIMEX3> in a standoff at a state - owned telecoms firm when caretaker Telecommunications Minister Charbel Nahhas was denied access to the building .
` ` It is another indication of the deterioration in the security situation and the inability of state institutions to manage , '' Williams said .
The political standoff and security fears also threaten Lebanon 's economy , with growth projections trimmed , tourism revenues expected to fall , and no progress on Lebanon 's plans to explore for oil and gas in the Mediterranean .
` ` I frankly find it distressing and troubling that the country is losing opportunities <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> .
It 's obvious that the economic situation is deteriorating , '' Williams said .
<TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2011-05-27">Friday</TIMEX3> 's bombing of the Italian peacekeepers , one of whom remains ` ` in a very grave condition , '' was the first such attack in <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DURATION" value="P3Y">three years</TIMEX3> on UNIFIL .
` ` We do n't see the attack in isolation , '' Williams said .
` ` Although it is the first on UNIFIL in a very long time we see the attack in the present security context . ''
Expressing concern and surprise at <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="2011-05-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> 's announcement that Italy -- which has the largest UNIFIL troop contingent -- will cut its peacekeeping force to 1,100 from 1,780 , Williams said he would travel to Rome <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="2011-W23">next week</TIMEX3> for talks .
UNIFIL was expanded to about 12,000 troops and naval personnel under a U.N. Security Council resolution which halted the <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="2006">2006</TIMEX3> Israel - Hezbollah war in south Lebanon .
It operates alongside 15,000 Lebanese army troops who are deployed to keep the peace and prevent weapons transfers in an area which is a stronghold of Hezbollah guerrillas .
Despite a deadly border clash <TIMEX3 tid="t36" type="DATE" value="2010-08">last August</TIMEX3> , Williams said the cessation of hostilities since <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DATE" value="2006">2006</TIMEX3> had held ` ` remarkably well . ''
` ` What 's been achieved is stability on the Blue Line and in southern Lebanon for the first time in decades .

In a way that is why I am most worried <TIMEX3 tid="t37" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> . ''
