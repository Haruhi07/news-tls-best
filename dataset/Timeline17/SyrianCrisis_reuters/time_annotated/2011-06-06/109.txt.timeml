ISTANBUL\/LONDON | Mon <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-06-06">Jun 6 , 2011</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2011-06-06T17:19">5:19 pm</TIMEX3> BST ISTANBUL\/LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Fuel shortages in many parts of Yemen worsened as the country 's main oil pipeline remained shut and tight funding hit imports , trade and shipping sources said on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-06-06">Monday</TIMEX3> .
A blast in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011-03">March</TIMEX3> on the pipeline , suspected to have been carried out by angry tribesmen , has stopped the flow of light Marib crude , which has forced the 130,000 barrels per day -LRB-
bpd -RRB- Aden refinery to shut and hurt fuel supplies .
` ` There has been no flow of crude and no Marib output .
The fuel shortages are worsening , especially in Sanaa , '' a Yemen - based shipping source said .
` ` Yes they 're importing , but not enough as they do n't have the money for it , and you ca n't find a lot of people these days to sell to them , trade with them . ''
Trade sources said that repairs and testing of the pipeline would take <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P2W" mod="APPROX">around two weeks</TIMEX3> from when the work begins .
` ` When that will be remains unknown and depends on the willingness of tribes to allow it to happen , '' one source said .
Yemenis celebrated on <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2011-06-06">Monday</TIMEX3> what many hoped will be a new era without President Ali Abdullah Saleh , who is <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> recuperating in Saudi Arabia after an operation to remove shrapnel from his chest <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2011-06-05">a day earlier</TIMEX3> .
The future remains uncertain for Yemen , home to an al Qaeda wing aiming to exploit a potential power vacuum in a nation near vital global oil transport links and torn by complex rivalries among tribal leaders , generals and politicians .
Yemen produced a total of around 260,000 bpd of crude oil in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3> .
Around 110,000 bpd of that is light crude , which is in short supply globally after Libyan output came to a virtual standstill due to a revolt there .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent weeks</TIMEX3> Yemen has tried to boost fuel imports to make up for the closure of the Aden refinery .
` ` There are several vessels due -- two in the next <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">coming days</TIMEX3> for diesel to be used in power stations , -LRB-
and -RRB- at least one cargo of gasoline .

But the thing is they 're running out of fuel very quickly , '' the shipping source said .
A trade source said fuel shortages have meant fuel prices have soared , with a 20 - litre container of petrol in bigger cities such as Aden costing 1,500 rials -LRB- $ 7.01 -RRB- and much higher at around 7,000 rials in more remote areas .
` ` People are buying fuel where they can and taking it to other areas where supplies are more scarce , '' the source said .
While Yemen 's light Marib crude output has been shut since mid - <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2011-03">March</TIMEX3> , heavier Masila crude output and exports have so far been unaffected .
Any descent into chaos in Yemen , the Arab world 's poorest country , which lies next to oil giant Saudi Arabia and major shipping lanes , would alarm Gulf neighbors and Western powers worried about al Qaeda .
