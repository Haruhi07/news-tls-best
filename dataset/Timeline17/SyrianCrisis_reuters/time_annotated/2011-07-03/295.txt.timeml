Full Article FEATURE - British veterans of Spain 's Civil War honored LONDON | Sun <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2011-07-03">Jul 3 , 2011</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2011-07-03T14:33">2:33 pm</TIMEX3> IST LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- -
Their spirit and convictions undiminished by age , British veterans of the Spanish Civil War were honored <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-W26-WE">this weekend</TIMEX3> at a ceremony marking the 75th anniversary of the outbreak of the epic conflict .
The International Brigades fought for the Republican side against fascism .
And though General Francisco Franco won the <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="1936">1936</TIMEX3> - <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="1939">39</TIMEX3> war , the deaths of their colleagues was not vain and the eventual return of democracy in Spain had made it all worthwhile , speakers said .
The event took place at the International Brigade Memorial in a park by the River Thames in London .
Relatives and supporters of veterans raised one - fisted salutes , laid wreaths and sang songs of solidarity .
The guests of honor were David Lomon and Thomas Watters , two of only four known British volunteers still living .
` ` I was Jewish , I was an anti - fascist .
Hitler and Mussolini were all over Europe .
Mosley was stirring up trouble in London .
I had to do something , '' said Lomon , <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> aged 93 , of his decision to join the International Brigades .
The war broke out on <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="1936-07-18">July 18 , 1936</TIMEX3> , with a military uprising against the reformist Republican government .
Franco was supported by Hitler and Mussolini .
Russia aided the Republicans but Britain and other powers followed a non - intervention policy .
But some 35,000 British , American and other nationalities joined the brigades , many of them dockers , miners or other workers who saw Spain as the frontline against a global threat .
Lomon told Reuters he volunteered just after his 18th birthday through the Anti - Communist League and was given a train ticket to Paris .
From there he was taken to the French - Spanish border , walked over the Pyrenees into Spain , and after <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="PXW">a few weeks</TIMEX3> training found himself at the frontline manning a Maxim machinegun .
` ` It was scary .
It was an education for me , '' he said .
` ` The people were so wonderful .
The peasants suffered
but they helped us so much , they made it all worthwhile . ''
` ` I fell in love with Spain .
It was worth fighting for , '' he said , dapper and still sharp - minded at the age of 93 .
Lomon was captured by Italian troops during the Republican retreat of <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="1938">1938</TIMEX3> and spent <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="PXM">several months</TIMEX3> in a prison camp until he was repatriatad .
` ` When I came back I decided I would carry on the fight . ''
With the outbreak of World War Two , he joined the Royal Navy and served on minesweepers in the English Channel and Asia .
Watters , 98 , served with the Scottish Ambulance Unit .
Born in Alloa , he trained as a medic while working as a bus driver in Glasgow and his main motivation was to help people .
` ` I had to go .
There were many wounded .
They asked for volunteers and I had to do it .
I was n't political , '' he told Reuters .
He was at the Battle of Jarama in <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="1937-02">February 1937</TIMEX3> , where both sides suffered huge casualties .
After <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">two years</TIMEX3> in Spain , he returned to his job on the buses .
<TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2011-W25">Last week</TIMEX3> , the British government released intelligence files that said about 4,000 British and Irish men and women joined the anti - fascist fight , some 1,500 more than previously thought .
Around 500 are known to have been killed .
Britain 's MI5 spy agency kept records on them into <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="195">the 1950s</TIMEX3> due to its fears of their possible communist links .
Among then were Eric Blair , better known as George Orwell , who wrote about his experiences in ` ` Homage to Catalonia '' , and author Laurie Lee .
In the decades since the conflict , it has become a reference point for many other foreign interventions and civil wars , particularly during the Central American wars of <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="198">the 1980s</TIMEX3> .
<TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2011">This year</TIMEX3> British Labor Party leader Ed Miliband and Australian Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd both evoked it when calling for international action in support of Libyan rebels .
Cuba 's Fidel Castro compared the NATO bombings to the German and Italian support for Franco .
And as the anniversary nears , the war is still controversial in Spain , which has been wary of reopening old wounds .
Peter Preston , regarded as the war 's leading historian , said in remarks at the ceremony organised by the International Brigade Memorial Trust that after the war , Franco ` ` brainwashed '' people into thinking he stood for freedom .
<TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">Recent</TIMEX3> attempts to account for the thousands of dead from extra - judicial killings during and after the conflict had been stymied , he said , noting the removal from office by the conservative judiciary of investigating judge Baltasar Garzon .
` ` The struggle continues , '' Preston said , quoting the Republican rallying cry .
Still , a Spanish diplomat attended the ceremony and praised the foreign veterans .
` ` Their solidarity , their generosity , their courage and their decency is an example to the younger generation , '' said Fidel Lopez Alvarez , cultural counsellor at the Spanish Embassy .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2007">2007</TIMEX3> , Spain passed a law giving citizenship to the veterans .
Lomon said he had received his passport <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2011-W24">two weeks ago</TIMEX3> .
` ` You deserve it , '' Lopez Alvarez told him .
