\ * EPA cuts cellulosic ethanol target for second year \ *
Cellulosic ethanol costs much more than corn - based fuel \ * Study says price - viable cellulosic ethanol years away -LRB-
Recasts , adds more details about cellulosic ethanol -RRB-
By Timothy Gardner and Tom Doggett WASHINGTON , <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-06-21">June 21</TIMEX3> -LRB- Reuters -RRB- -
The dream of making a green motor fuel from switchgrass or wood chips got kicked down the road for a few more years after the U.S. government on <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2011-06-21">Tuesday</TIMEX3> slashed its proposed mandate for next - generation biofuels .
For the second year in a row , the Environmental Protection Agency cut the amount of cellulosic ethanol that must be mixed into motor fuel .
<TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2012">Next year</TIMEX3> , only 3.45 million to 12.9 million gallons of cellulosic biofuel will have to be mixed into the country 's gasoline pool by fuel blenders , far below the original goal of 500 million gallons .
EPA slashed the target for <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011">this year</TIMEX3> to 6 million gallons from the 250 million gallons required in the renewable fuels standard Congress passed in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2005">2005</TIMEX3> .
Cellulosic ethanol is made from grasses , wood chips and agricultural waste , which environmentalists and consumer groups say is better than using a food crop such as corn to make the fuel .
Cellulosic has been envisioned as a key part of boosting the amount of renewable fuels used in the United States .
Congress had mandated that 36 billion gallons of biofuels should be used in the United States by <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2022">2022</TIMEX3> .
Congress has mandated corn ethanol would top out at 15 billion gallons by <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3> , and that is on track .
The EPA on <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2011-06-21">Tuesday</TIMEX3> proposed increasing the use of corn - based ethanol to 13.2 billion gallons <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2012">next year</TIMEX3> , matching what Congress required .

But cellulosic is supposed to keep growing <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="SET" value="P1Y" quant="EVERY">every year</TIMEX3> until it reaches 16 billion gallons by <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2022">2022</TIMEX3> .
So far it has failed to live up to expectations .
The revised mandate could affect companies working to develop cellulosic including Solazyme -LRB- SZYM .
O -RRB- , CleanTech Biofuels CLTH .
PK , Coskata Inc , and KiOR Inc , which <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to go public .
The main problem is the cost of producing cellulosic is still high and it may be years before that can brought down to compete with corn - based ethanol .
Second - generation biofuel producers must rely on expensive enzymes .
So the ethanol industry must depend largely on the corn crop , fueling criticism the business is driving up food prices worldwide .
` ` They ' ve been looking for the magic formula for a cheap enzyme that will break down the cellulose but they 're still far from it , '' said Rick Kment , an ethanol analyst at Telvent DTN .
Enzymes used to make cellulosic can cost up to $ 2 per gallon .
When the costs of building and maintaining biorefineries , labor , and transportation are added to the enzyme costs , cellulosic is far more expensive than gasoline .
In addition , the available amount of research and development money for advanced biofuels has fallen .
A new study <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2011-06">this month</TIMEX3> concluded there is an 11 - year gap between wood - based biofuels production and its commercial viability .
` ` Major technical hurdles will likely disrupt commercialization for most of the technologies under development , '' said Bruce Schiamberg of the Schiamberg Group , the co - author of the study .

But the EPA was hopeful .
` ` The agency remains optimistic that the commercial availability of cellulosic biofuel will continue to grow in the years ahead , '' EPA said .
About 11 percent of all motor fuel used in <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2012">2012</TIMEX3> will come from biofuels , up sharply from about 8 percent <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2011">this year</TIMEX3> , the EPA said .
With ethanol output <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2011">this year</TIMEX3> expected to total 13.5 billion gallons , ethanol producers already exceed the <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2012">2012</TIMEX3> target of 13.2 billion gallons .
<TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2011">This year</TIMEX3> 's corn - based ethanol use target is 12.6 billion gallons .
U.S. senators voted overwhelmingly <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2011-W24">last week</TIMEX3> for an amendment to end the support payments and the tariff wall that protects the ethanol sector .
The amendment is far from coming law , however .
The EPA will take public comment on its proposal through <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2011-08-11">Aug. 11</TIMEX3> , and then finalize the renewable fuel standard in <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2011-11">November</TIMEX3> .
