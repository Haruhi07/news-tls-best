EPSOM , England | Sat <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-06-04">Jun 4 , 2011</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2011-06-04T21:27">9:27 pm</TIMEX3> BST EPSOM , England -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Teenage jockey Mickael Barzalona earned a one - day ban to go with a winning ride in his first Epsom Derby on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-06-04">Saturday</TIMEX3> after standing up to celebrate a dramatic victory even before passing the post .
The 19 - year - old Barzalona lifted himself out of his stirrups and punched the air with his whip in delight before landing the spoils for France and trainer Andre Fabre with victory on 4 - 1 chance Pour Moi .
The youngster received a one - day ban and a warning because of his ` ` premature celebration . ''
They also ruled that Barzalona had used his whip too much in the closing stages .
But nothing could spoil the day for the Frenchman , grandson of a racehorse trainer in Corsica .
He told reporters : ` ` I did n't really plan the celebrations at the finish -- it just happened . ''
Barzalona had bided his time at the rear but made dramatic late ground to win England 's premier classic by a head from 25 - 1 Irish - trained outsider Treasure Beach and 5 - 2 favorite Carlton House , owned by Britain 's Queen Elizabeth .
` ` I was not worried about being last for much of the race as I had all the other good horses just in front of me , '' the winning jockey said .
` ` I hoped they would take me along and that is what happened .
` ` Pour Moi gave me an immediate response and horse after horse came to me when I asked him to go .
I thought I would finish fourth or fifth
but he just went on and on . ''
Barzalona , nephew of ex - rider Armand Barzalona , spent <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P4Y">four years</TIMEX3> at a French jockeys ' school before joining Fabre in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3> .
He has ridden for the Godolphin operation of Sheikh Mohammed of Dubai and other big wins include <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2011">this year</TIMEX3> 's United Arab Emirates Derby .
Fabre , 65 , and winning his first English Derby at his 10th attempt , said : ` ` It 's so pleasing that Mickael is a home - grown jockey -- and I know his family .
` ` It 's such a pleasure to win this race and under these conditions , with a young jockey and this big crowd .
I could n't be more happy . ''
As for the one - day ban for Barzalona over his joyous celebrations , Fabre observed wryly : ` ` He is only 19 . ''
