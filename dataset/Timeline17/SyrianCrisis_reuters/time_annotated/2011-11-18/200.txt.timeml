Reuters -RRB- - U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-11-18">Friday</TIMEX3> Syria could slide into civil war but she did not foresee the global community intervening in the same way it did in Libya .
` ` I think there could be a civil war with a very determined and well - armed and eventually well - financed opposition that is , if not directed by , certainly influenced by defectors from the army , '' Clinton told NBC news in an interview in Indonesia , where she was attending a regional summit .
` ` We 're already seeing that , something that we hate to see because we are in favor of a peaceful protest and a nonviolent opposition , '' she said .
Clinton said , however , that she saw no prospect for the kind of coordinated international intervention that occurred in Libya , where a NATO - led coalition won a U.N. mandate to mount air strikes in support of rebels fighting Muammar Gaddafi .
` ` There is no appetite for that kind of action vis - a - vis Syria , '' Clinton said , pointing to regional moves by the Arab League and Turkey as key to persuading Syrian President Bashar al - Assad to halt the violence against civilians .
The United States and the European Union have both imposed a series of targeted sanctions against Damascus .

But U.N. sanctions are seen as unlikely given opposition from Russia and China , which <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011-10">last month</TIMEX3> vetoed a draft Security Council resolution condemning Syria .
The Arab League has suspended Syria and set a <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2011-11-12">Saturday</TIMEX3> deadline for it to comply with the Arab peace plan , which entails a military pullout from around restive cities and towns , threatening sanctions unless Assad acts to halt the violence .
Clinton told CBS in a separate interview that it was clear Assad 's days were numbered .
` ` Look , Assad 's going to be gone ; it 's just a question of time .
What we hope is that they avoid a civil war , that they avoid greater bloodshed , that they make the changes that they should have been making all along .
And we think the Arab League pressure is probably the most effective pressure , '' she said .

Not good for our only Ally in the middle east and not good for the US .
As long as the United States is smack dab in the middle of it I ' m all for it .
I thought she meant here in the US .
