NEW YORK | Tue <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-03-15">Mar 15 , 2011</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="TIME" value="2011-03-15T23:07">11:07 pm</TIMEX3> GMT NEW YORK -LRB-
Reuters -RRB- - Private equity firm KKR & Co LP -LRB- KKR .
N -RRB- is increasing the sources of capital it taps as it gears up to raise its next buyout fund , the company said at its first ever investor day on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2011-03-15">Tuesday</TIMEX3> .
KKR , which raised an $ 18 billion global buyout fund in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2006">2006</TIMEX3> , is just starting to raise a new North American - focused fund with a target size of $ 8 billion to $ 10 billion .
Private equity firms raise capital that they typically use to buy companies , turn them around and sell for a higher price , returning the profit to the investors that supplied the capital .
The credit crisis limited dealflow and made raising capital for new funds hard , as investors were less willing and able to commit capital to new funds .
The harder fundraising environment has caused funds have to search out new investors .
Nuttall said that KKR , which has 350 fund investors or ` ` limited partners , '' is working on adding more .
Arch - rival Blackstone Group -LRB- BX .
N -RRB- has more than 1,300 , a source close to the company said .
` ` It is incumbent on us -- and we will do this in the next fundraise that we are in process of doing for North America -- to find other sources of capital that are not invested in us , '' co - founder and co - Chief Executive George Roberts said .
More money is being attracted to the alternative investment space , increasingly from new investors , co - founder and co - CEO Henry Kravis said .
KKR said it has more than $ 11 billion of ` ` dry powder , '' or capital available to invest , and sees potential deals around the world .
` ` We believe that is incredible capital to take advantage of the opportunities we see in private equity around the globe , '' said Alexander Navab , KKR 's co - head of North American private equity .
Leveraged buyouts -- the debt - fueled deals private equity is known for -- have been increasing in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2010">the past year</TIMEX3> as financing for deals has become easier to find .
KKR said North America is attractive for private equity , with improved credit markets and ` ` generally reasonable '' equity valuations .
The company 's European head said KKR sees opportunities in France and the financial services sector .
In Asia , KKR cited opportunities in China and said Japan looks attractive from a pure valuation point of view .
It is seeking large transactions in markets such as Australia , Singapore , Korea , Japan and India .
KKR 's $ 11 billion includes $ 3.5 billion of uncommitted capital remaining in its <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2006">2006</TIMEX3> fund , which will probably prove one of the strongest of its vintage , said Michael Michelson , co - head of North American private equity .
KKR also raised more than $ 1 billion for a China fund in record time for the firm , Navab said .
However , its European Fund II is valued at 93 percent of cost , which KKR described as ` ` disappointing -LRB-
but -RRB- an improvement on <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3> . ''
Roberts said KKR probably paid too much for a couple of deals , which was ` ` probably why Europe II is still not performing '' as it thinks it should .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2010-11">November</TIMEX3> Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher suggested that a bubble is forming in private equity , with cheap debt fueling high - priced deals in an echo of the torrid days of LBOs before the subprime credit crisis cut off financing in <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2007">2007</TIMEX3> .
KKR remains focused on buyouts even though it has expanded <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="PXY" mod="MORE_THAN">over the past few years</TIMEX3> into areas such as real estate and capital markets .
` ` Private equity is our heritage , our core business , and we ' ve been able to build a number of businesses around it , '' Scott Nuttall , global head of capital and asset management , said at the event , which was attended by about 100 investors .
KKR said it was confident its new long - short team would be in the market soon and raise significant capital over time .
<TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2010-10">Last October</TIMEX3> , KKR hired nine members of Goldman Sachs Group Inc 's -LRB- GS .
N -RRB- proprietary trading team .
` ` Buyout king '' Kravis , who co - founded KKR <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="1976" mod="APPROX">nearly 35 years ago</TIMEX3> , said he and co - founder Roberts think about succession issues <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EVERY">every day</TIMEX3> but added that their stepping down , ` ` I hope is in the distant future . ''
KKR has a deep bench of potential successors , Kravis said .
KKR listed on the New York Stock Exchange on <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2010-07-15">July 15</TIMEX3> , joining rival Blackstone Group LP -LRB- BX .
N -RRB- , which made its debut in <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2007">2007</TIMEX3> .
Shares of KKR fell 4 percent to close at $ 16.59 on the New York Stock Exchange .
Other large private equity firms such Carlyle Group CYL .
UL and Apollo Management APOLO .
UL are also likely to go public .
Apollo is expected to set terms soon for an IPO of up to $ 500 million , sources told Reuters late on <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2011-03-14">Monday</TIMEX3> .
Private equity firms going public have sometimes been questioned by investors concerned about whether their interests will be aligned .
Roberts said that forward - thinking investors realize that ` ` <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DURATION" value="P5Y" mod="MORE_THAN">over the next five years</TIMEX3> the other established private equity firms will be public in one form or another ...
this is a trend and is probably in their best interests as well . ''
