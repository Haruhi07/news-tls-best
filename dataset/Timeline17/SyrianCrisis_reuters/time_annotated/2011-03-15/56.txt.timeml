LONDON | Tue <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-03-15">Mar 15 , 2011</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2011-03-15T04:54">4:54 am</TIMEX3> GMT LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Chief executives of public bodies should be forced to justify their salary and have pay docked if they do n't perform , a government - sponsored report recommended on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-03-15">Tuesday</TIMEX3> .
The findings of the ` ` Fair Pay Review '' are designed to halt <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P1DE">a decade</TIMEX3> - long trend which has seen pay at the top of the public sector grow faster than pay levels at the bottom .
Prime Minister David Cameron asked Will Hutton , a left - leaning commentator and former head of the Work Foundation , to conduct the review <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010">last year</TIMEX3> .
Scrutiny of high - earning executives has intensified ever since the government was forced to bail out the banking sector with public funds .
Most public anger has been directed at bank chief executives , labeled ` ` fat cats '' in the media , but top - earning public sector chiefs have not been immune .
In an interim report <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-12">last December</TIMEX3> , Hutton set out a case for a maximum pay multiple that would keep the pay of top executives bound to what their staff earned , with a 20:1 ratio the maximum .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2011-03-15">Tuesday</TIMEX3> 's final report , Hutton moves away from this idea .
Instead he proposes that public sector executives place at least 10 percent of their salary at risk in an ` ` earnback '' scheme , which can only be reclaimed if targets are met .
If targets are exceeded , the same proportion could be earned as a bonus .
` ` I am recommending that all public service executives are required to place an element of their basic pay at risk , to be earned back <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="SET" value="P1Y" quant="EACH">each year</TIMEX3> through good performance , '' Hutton said .
The report also recommends that public bodies publish , and justify , the multiple of chief executive to workforce median pay -- a step it argues should also be adopted by the private sector .
` ` Organisations delivering public services should publish their pay multiples <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="SET" value="P1Y" quant="EACH">each year</TIMEX3> , and disclose and explain executive pay and how it relates to job responsibilities and individual performance , '' Hutton said .
The government , eager for a framework to curb what Hutton has called an ` ` arms race '' - like scramble to increase remuneration for high - earners , is likely to welcome the recommendations .
But Unison , Britain 's largest trade union , said the review did not go far enough .
` ` The focus on top pay is a missed opportunity .
To really boost fairness in the public sector , and our society as a whole , we need to tackle low wages -- not just income inequality , '' Unison General Secretary Dave Prentis said .
