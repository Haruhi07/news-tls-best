THESSALONIKI , Greece | Sat <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011-09-10">Sep 10 , 2011</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="TIME" value="2011-09-10T22:24">10:24 pm</TIMEX3> BST THESSALONIKI , Greece -LRB-
Reuters -RRB- - Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou said on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2011-09-10">Saturday</TIMEX3> he would do whatever it takes to rescue his country from bankruptcy and stay in the euro zone , as doubts in Europe grew over its membership in the bloc .
Sending a message to international lenders increasingly frustrated with delays in reforms and missed fiscal targets , Papandreou said his government was determined to take the difficult decisions and make the sacrifices needed .
` ` We decided to fight the battle to avoid a disaster for the country and its people and to stay in the euro , '' he said in his annual economic speech at a trade fair in the northern city of Thessaloniki .
` ` Any delay and wavering is dangerous for the country . ''
Anger at the country 's failure to meet fiscal targets under its EU\/IMF bailout has reached boiling point , prompting senior euro zone policymakers to cast doubt on its ability to avoid default or even its membership in the single currency .
The embattled premier , who was heckled by angry labor unions on <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2011-09-09">Friday</TIMEX3> , said he would redouble efforts to fight endemic tax evasion , a main hurdle in achieving fiscal targets .
His Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said earlier Greece may even take additional fiscal measures in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3> to make up for budget deficit slippage that threatens the disbursement of an 8 billion euro EU\/IMF loan tranche .
Venizelos pledged to further cut the civil service payroll , push privatisations and deepen labor market reforms .
Civil servants , who have seen about a fifth of their wages slashed , will suffer more after the government decided to put thousands of them in a so - called ` ` Labor Reserve , '' in which they will draw 60 percent of their salary and possibly face dismissal if they find no other public sector job within <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> .

But austerity measures are throwing the economy into an ever deeper recession .
GDP will shrink by more than 5 percent <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2011">this year</TIMEX3> , Venizelos said , topping earlier projections in its third straight year of contraction .
More than 20,000 protesters gathered in the northern city to mark Papandreou 's speech .
Police fired tear gas at youths smashing shop windows and setting fires on the main shopping streets .
Police said 106 people were detained .
Demonstrations were organised by civil servants , students , taxi drivers and even football fans .
Some restaurants in the city shut down to protest a VAT hike that took effect <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2011-09" mod="START">earlier this month</TIMEX3> .
` ` We are suffering an unprecedented tax raid ...
we deeply worry about <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2011-09-11">tomorrow</TIMEX3> , '' George Kasimatis , chairman of Greece 's Chamber of Commerce Federation , told Venizelos during the conference .
About 7,000 police were patrolling the city 's streets , cordoning off the fairgrounds .
Ministers canceled plans for their usual walkabouts in the city and Papandreou avoided touring the fair in the morning , as prime ministers traditionally do on the event 's first day .
While vowing to keep its side of the bargain , the Greek government sharply criticised its EU partners for delaying ratification of a second , 109 - billion - euro bailout for the country , agreed by euro zone leaders on <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2011-07-21">July 21</TIMEX3> .
` ` Europe must rise to the challenge and move towards implementing the <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2012-07-21">July 21</TIMEX3> decisions , to put an end to the Sisyphean ordeal the Greek people is going through , '' said Development Minister Mihalis Chrysohoidis .
` ` Doing nothing is disastrous for all of us , '' he added .
A G7 source said the troika -LRB- EU\/IMF\/ECB -RRB- , which suspended talks with Athens <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2011-W35">last week</TIMEX3> in frustration at Greece 's struggle to stick to its deficit reduction plan , would probably come up with a form of words in its next report to allow the next tranche of bailout funds to be paid .

But the working assumption is that Greece will not avoid default indefinitely .
However , a bond swap plan for private bondholders , which is part of the second bailout plan and is supposed to ease Greece 's debt payments was progressing well , Venizelos said .
` ` The private sector is responding very well to the PSI -LRB- private sector involvement -RRB- , '' he said , without elaborating , <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DURATION" value="P1D">one day</TIMEX3> after an initial deadline for banks to express interest in the scheme expired .
