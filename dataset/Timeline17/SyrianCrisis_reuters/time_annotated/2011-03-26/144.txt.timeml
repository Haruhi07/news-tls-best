Following are some comments on what may lie ahead for Syria .
MAHA AZZAM , associate fellow at Chatham House ` ` Frictions will increase between the Assad regime and some in the army .
But it is difficult to say what direction the army will take .
` ` It has been closely controlled by the regime and it has vested interests in the status quo .
If it sees the Assad family as a liability , the army may feel it is in its interests to move against the regime .

But I think you would need a greater momentum on the streets for that to happen .
` ` For <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> they 'll wait to see if the regime can bring reforms .
My view is that the reforms would have to be drastic to be accepted by the people .
` ` What we ' ve seen in the other revolts in the region suggests that in Syria , even if the popular opposition is stemmed in <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">coming weeks</TIMEX3> , it will resurface .
Once you have broken the barrier of fear , it is probably a matter of when , not if , a regime falls .
` ` Stability in Syria is important for its neighbors including Israel and what 's happening is worrying for all of them , as well as for governments in the Gulf . ''
FAYSAL ITANI , deputy head of Middle East and North Africa Forecasting at Exclusive Analysis ` ` The regime really does n't have any good options .
It is placing enormous pressure on the mainly Sunni army by ordering it to fire on Sunni demonstrators .
With the exception of the Alawi Republican Guard , the army is a Sunni conscript force .
` ` If the unrest continues at this pace the Syrian army is not going to be able to maintain cohesion . ''
Asked if a repeat of the sort of wholesale massacre seen at Hama in <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="198">the 1980s</TIMEX3> was possible , Itani replied : ` ` There is a very real risk of such a thing happening .
For a minority regime this is an existential struggle .
Minorities can not afford to let majorities take liberties .
They do n't tend to see the middle ground .
` ` The question is not whether they are willing to do it .
The question is whether they have enough troops willing to do it . ''
KARIM EMILE BITAR , research fellow at the Paris - based Institute for International and Strategic Relations ` ` The Syrian regime will have to reform itself radically if it wants to survive .
No country in the region is immune in the face of this revolutionary wind that is blowing from the Atlantic to the Gulf .
` ` The Syrian regime is attempting to make promises such as a potential lifting of the state of emergency , which has been in place since <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="1963">1963</TIMEX3> , a record in the Arab world .

But if this happens it will be the end of a whole system , prisoners will have to be released , the press will be free ... when this kind of regime considers relaxing its grip , it also knows that everything could collapse .
` ` I think the army and the secret services will remain faithful to al - Assad right until the end , for reasons that are essentially sectarian -LRB- i.e. preservation of minority Allawite rule -RRB- .
In Bahrain they played the Sunni - Shi ` ite card , in Syria we will see the Allawite - Sunni card .
` ` The specter of the -LRB- <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="1982">1982</TIMEX3> -RRB-
Hama massacre is very present ... but <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> that there is YouTube , Facebook , Al Jazeera .
It 's no longer so easy to crush dissent in this way .
` ` The international community does not have a lot of room for maneuver , but there are nonetheless lines that can not be crossed .
` ` Syria is Iran 's main ally in the Arab world .
A fall of the regime would have consequences for Hezbollah and Hamas ...
I ' m not sure that the region 's big powers would allow such a big shock . ''
