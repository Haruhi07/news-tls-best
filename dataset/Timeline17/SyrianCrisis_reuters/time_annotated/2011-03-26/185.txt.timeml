Reuters -RRB- - Red Bull 's world champion Sebastian Vettel blew away his rivals in a dominant qualifying performance to claim pole position for the season - opening Australian Grand Prix on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-03-26">Saturday</TIMEX3> .
The 23 - year - old German set the quickest time in all three sessions and managed a searing best lap of <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="PT1M">one minute</TIMEX3> 23.529 seconds , 0.778 seconds quicker than second - placed Briton Lewis Hamilton .
` ` Although the gap <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> might appear to be big , it 's a long season and a lot of things can happen , '' said a cautious Vettel , who failed to finish the race here <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010">last year</TIMEX3> .
` ` It 's a good position to be in , and I ' m very happy with that -LRB-
but -RRB- we need to keep our feet on the ground . ''
Hamilton 's late lap of 1.24.307 in his McLaren knocked Vettel 's team mate Mark Webber -LRB-
1.24.395 -RRB- off the front row of the grid , leaving the Australian to line up alongside Jenson Button in the second McLaren -LRB-
1.24.779 -RRB- .
Ferrari 's twice former world champion Fernando Alonso claimed a spot on the third row in fifth place next to Renault 's Vitaly Petrov , the best ever qualifying position for the Russian .
Button , who will be gunning for a third successive win at Albert Park , conceded that Vettel had been untouchable .
` ` If you look at the pace of Sebastian , I mean they 're in a different league really in qualifying , whether it 's the same in the race I do n't know , '' said Button .
` ` We do n't really know what our pace is really going to be like in the race distance yet . ''
McLaren struggled for reliability in testing and Hamilton paid tribute to the ` ` fantastic job '' done by the team to give their two British drivers a competitive car .
` ` Absolutely thrilled to be here <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2011-03-26">today</TIMEX3> , we ' ve really got ourselves back on track and , although there 's a lot of work to do , we laid a fantastic base , '' the <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> world champion said .
Webber is aiming to become the first Australian to win his home grand prix and was clearly disappointed at being so far behind his team mate .
` ` I ' m not overly rapt to be third on the grid , '' he said .
` ` I was n't really in the fight for pole and I need to address that . ''
German Nico Rosberg steered his Mercedes to seventh place on the grid ahead of Brazilian Felipe Massa on what was a disappointing day for Ferrari .
` ` Position we are happy , distance from pole we are not so happy , so it 's what we have to look at and analyze <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="TIME" value="2011-03-26TNI">tonight</TIMEX3> , '' Spaniard Alonso said .
German Michael Schumacher failed to fulfil the promise of good pre - season testing with Mercedes when he was unable to get through to the final session of qualifying by 0.089 seconds .
` ` After testing , coming to the first race we had expected certainly a different performance so naturally there is some disappointment , '' the seven - times world champion , who will start 11th , told the BBC .
` ` We do n't match this performance here and we need to understand why we do n't and that 's going to be the major job that we have in front of us . ''
HRT 's Vitantonio Liuzzi and Narain Karthikeyan failed to get within 107 percent of the best time in the first qualifying session so will not be allowed to race .

The struggling Spanish - based team 's appeal to the stewards was dismissed later on <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2011-03-26">Saturday</TIMEX3> , leaving just 22 cars on the grid for <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2011-03-20">Sunday</TIMEX3> 's race .
