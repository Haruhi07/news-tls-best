PARIS | We d <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-10-12">Oct 12 , 2011</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2011-10-12T08:23">8:23 am</TIMEX3> EDT PARIS -LRB-
Reuters -RRB- - Western nations are not doing enough to pressure Russia into changing its stance on Syria and must do more to support the burgeoning opposition , the figurehead for the Syrian National Council -LRB- SNC -RRB- said on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-10-07">Friday</TIMEX3> .
Paris - based Burhan Ghalioun , considered the group 's de facto leader , told France 24 television the newly formed SNC hoped to get recognition from European countries once its structure is in place .
The European Union has welcomed the creation of the Syrian council and urged other countries to do the same , but stopped short of any call to recognize the body which is seeking international support for a six - month - old uprising against President Bashar al - Assad .
France , the first Western country to recognize Libya 's opposition , has been championing the cause of pro - democracy protesters in Syria , leading calls for a U.N. Security Council resolution to condemn the government 's bloody crackdown on them .
In a symbolic display of support , French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe met Ghalioun in Paris <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2011-W41" mod="START">earlier this week</TIMEX3> .
` ` Juppe 's gesture was significant , '' Ghalioun said .
` ` The French will consult the other Europeans and we hope to have recognition from European countries later , but let 's wait <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="PXD">a few days</TIMEX3> , weeks , '' he said .
Ghalioun , an intellectual and political sociologist based at the Sorbonne university , was thrust into the limelight <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2011">this year</TIMEX3> when peaceful protests against Assad 's government turned violent and demonstrators looked for somebody to help galvanize various strands of the opposition .
The 66 - year old said the West could be more ` ` aggressive '' in its approach to Russia , which has refused to join international condemnation of Syria 's long crackdown on protesters and used its veto along with China to reject a draft U.N. resolution .
He also called for a conference bringing together the main stakeholders in the Syrian conflict .
` ` I think the European Union and Western countries have not done everything politically to convince Russia and other reticent countries , '' Ghalioun said .
` ` I do n't think there are strong enough positions and actions . ''
Some figures inside Syria privately criticize the opposition in exile for being too ready to seek outside intervention .
Other issues dividing the opposition include ethnic and sectarian differences , disagreement over the place of religion in the state and a generational gap between veteran opposition figures and youth activists .
Michel Kilo , a member of the Syria - based National Committee for Democratic Change -LRB-
NCDC -RRB- who has criticized the SNC for not including those in Syria , said on <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2011-10-11">Tuesday</TIMEX3> he was ready to talk more to the council to avoid divisions that could play into the hands of Assad 's government .
` ` <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2011-10-12">Today</TIMEX3> , there is the council and there are other opposition members and we will do everything to make sure there is just one voice , '' Ghalioun said .
` ` I do n't think the opposition is divided .
I think the opposition is unanimous on one objective : the end of the regime and fall of Bashar al - Assad . ''
Asked whether the SNC could take up arms if protests did not lead to the government 's collapse , Ghalioun dismissed the idea for <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> but said there was a risk of escalation .
` ` We are afraid of it ending up in civil war and anarchy so it 's up to show that a new Syria wo n't be one of vengeance and revenge , '' he said .
