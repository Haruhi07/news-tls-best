DUBAI | We d <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-07-13">Jul 13 , 2011</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2011-07-13T07:13">7:13 am</TIMEX3> BST DUBAI -LRB-
Reuters -RRB- - Saudi Arabia has helped damp down democracy movements sweeping the Arab world but is waiting <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> to see how events play out in places like Syria and Yemen for fear of overplaying its hand .
After witnessing the sudden collapse of rulers in Egypt and Tunisia <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011">this year</TIMEX3> , the Al Saud family that monopolises power in Saudi Arabia orchestrated Gulf Arab moves to stop the unrest from spreading through the Gulf region .
Saudi , United Arab Emirates and Kuwaiti forces went to Bahrain in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2011-03">March</TIMEX3> to help crush protests threatening to force the ruling family there to make democratic changes .
They offered money to Oman and Bahrain for more social spending , and Qatar 's Al Jazeera TV toned down its hard - hitting Gulf coverage after meetings between Saudi and Qatari officials .
Riyadh was the prime mover behind a Gulf Cooperation Council -LRB- GCC -RRB- proposal to enhance relations with Jordan and Morocco in an apparent effort to boost other Arab dynastic systems .
A Saudi official said Jordan was given $ 400 million -LRB- 251 million pounds -RRB- <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2011-06">last month</TIMEX3> .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2011-03">March</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2011-04">April</TIMEX3> it also brokered a peace deal in Yemen , a republic different in size and social make - up to the GCC countries , that was to see President Ali Abdullah Saleh step down <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P1M">one month</TIMEX3> after forming a cabinet .
Yet following that flurry of interventions , Saudi diplomacy has largely gone quiet , most notably on two fronts where Riyadh has major interests -- Yemen and Syria .
Its response also has been muted in Libya , a more distant concern for Riyadh .
Analysts and diplomats say there are disputes within the ranks of senior princes and officials on whether to take a back seat , intervene more forcefully to stop democratic changes or , in some cases , to back them .
Turki Al - Rasheed , a Saudi commentator who runs the Saudi In Focus web forum , said the kingdom 's leaders had run out of ideas on how to challenge the movements amid internal disputes and given the lethargy of senior princes holding different briefs .
` ` They are quiet because they did something and it failed .
Bahrain is still boiling .
The only card <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> is to pay the Americans billions for their weapons , '' he said , referring to reports that $ 60 billion in arms purchases from the United States would rise to $ 90 billion .
The ruling Al Khalifa family has instituted a national dialogue in Bahrain , but protests continue in neighborhoods of the majority Shi'ite population , who dominated the protest movement .
Demonstrations rekindled in Oman <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2011-W27">last week</TIMEX3> .
Saudi Arabia has seen only a small number of protests in Shi'ite areas of its Eastern Province .
Stern government warnings and promises of massive social spending have helped hold back a protest movement taking off on its soil .
` ` There is no one single Saudi policy .
Each issue is handled from a different point of view and they -LRB- the princes -RRB- are all very old and sick , '' Rasheed said .
Diplomats in Riyadh often say rigor mortis usually sets in with Saudi policy initiatives during the long <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2011-SU">summer</TIMEX3> recess .
One Saudi commentator who did not wish to be named said there has been division over how to proceed on Yemen .
Interior Minister Prince Nayef backs Saleh while Crown Prince and Defense Minister Prince Sultan favor alternatives among tribes paid by the kingdom .
However , Sultan , in his 80s , left <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2011-06">last month</TIMEX3> for treatment in New York and Nayef , in his <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="197" mod="END">late 70s</TIMEX3> , also has been abroad for rest and recreation .
Saleh has been convalescing in a Riyadh hospital since <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2011-06" mod="START">early June</TIMEX3> when he was badly burnt in an apparent assassination attempt .
A bomb went off as he and government officials were performing <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2011-07-08">Friday</TIMEX3> prayers in a mosque at his palace .

But Riyadh has made no clear effort to enforce the GCC peace initiative , which Arab and Western diplomats say was largely a Saudi proposal from the beginning .
Ghanem Nuseibah , London - based analyst at Political Capital , said the Saudi family 's first preference for Saleh to remain in power had given way to promoting Hamid Al - Ahmar , a 44 - year - old businessman close to U.S. officials .
The Saudi ideal is for Saleh 's system of family rule , balancing Saudi - backed tribal forces , to remain intact .
This is exactly what the democracy activists who first took to the streets of Sanaa in <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2011-01">January</TIMEX3> want to avoid .
But fighting between tribesmen of Sadeq Al - Ahmar , head of the Hashed tribal confederation , and government forces loyal to Saleh -- whose military and security apparatus are headed by his extended family -- broke out in <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2011-05">May</TIMEX3> .
This confounded Saudi efforts at that stage to engineer cosmetic change .
<TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> Riyadh is holding on to Saleh while it weighs its options on who can be the most effective strongman among the tribes it funded during Saleh 's <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DURATION" value="P33Y">33 years</TIMEX3> of rule , Nuseibah said .
Nuseibah said even Yemeni tribal figures close to Riyadh have expressed frustration with Saudi inaction .
` ` They see the way the Saudis have reacted since the beginning , '' he said .
` ` First they were pro - Saleh , then they bring Saleh to Riyadh but still letting him be a figurehead for the <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> regime , though he is not personally ruling . ''
Saudi relations with Syria have been strained since the murder in <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="2005">2005</TIMEX3> of former Lebanese prime minister Rafik Hariri , a Saudi citizen and facilitator of Saudi policy in Lebanon where Iran has influence through Shi'ite group Hezbollah .
Riyadh accuses Syrian leader Bashar al - Assad of helping Iran in a policy of extending its influence in Arab countries , primarily through its alliance with Lebanon 's Hezbollah .
But while Al Jazeera and Saudi mouthpiece Al Arabiya TV have focussed heavily on Damascus 's attempt to crush protests , there have been no diplomatic initiatives to resolve the conflict , as France , Turkey and the United States have dominated international reaction to the turmoil in Syria .
Some Saudis say this is not because the ruling clique -- King Abdullah , Nayef , Sultan and a few other senior princes -- do no want to see Assad removed from power .
` ` With Libya and Syria , I ' m sure the government would like to see those leaders fall , but in their own time , without getting involved , '' the Saudi commentator who requested anonymity said .
` ` Naturally Saudi Arabia , being a kingdom , sees any sudden change in power that 's <TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> happening in the Middle East as a threat that might be contagious at some point , '' he added .
