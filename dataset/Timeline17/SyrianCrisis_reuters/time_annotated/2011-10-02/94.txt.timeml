Reuters -RRB- - Syria 's main opposition groups joined together <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-10-02">Sunday</TIMEX3> to call on the international community to take action to protect Syrian people facing a violent crackdown on pro - democracy protests .
A statement issued in Istanbul on behalf of the newly formed National Council rejected foreign intervention that ` ` compromises Syria 's sovereignty '' but said the outside world had a humanitarian obligation to protect the Syrian people .
` ` The Council demands international governments and organizations meet their responsibility to support the Syrian people , protect them and stop the crimes and gross human rights violations being committed by the illegitimate <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> regime , '' the statement said .
The declaration and support for the National Council was a significant show of unity from the Syrian opposition after <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P6M">six months</TIMEX3> of mostly non - violent protests against President Bashar al - Assad have begun to be overtaken by more violent resistance .
Armed insurgents , mostly in the central Homs region and in the northwestern province of Idlib near Turkey , have been so far outgunned .
The official Syrian news agency said <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2011-10-01">Saturday</TIMEX3> government forces had regained control of the central town of Rastan , after the most prolonged fighting yet between the army and insurgents who are led , according to residents , by army defectors .
But underlining the more violent turn , Syrian authorities said that the son of Syria 's Mufti , who is appointed by Assad , was assassinated <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2011-10-02">Sunday</TIMEX3> .
It was the first attack against the state - backed Sunni clergy who have been a base of support for Assad 's ruling Alawite elite for decades .
In Istanbul , the National Council said that the uprising must remain peaceful but that military assaults on numerous towns and villages , torture and mass arrests were driving Syria ` ` to the edge of civil war and inviting foreign interference . ''
It also said the Muslim Brotherhood , the Damascus Declaration - the main grouping of established opposition figures - and grassroots activists all had joined the National Council .
While few expect a Libya - style intervention in Syria , the declaration was nonetheless a way for the opposition to shake off its image of in - fighting and lack of cohesive leadership .
` ` The fact that Islamists , secular figures and activists on the ground are <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> on one council is a significant , '' a diplomat in the Syrian capital Damascus said .
` ` But they still have to demonstrate that they could be politically savvy and able to fill any political vacuum .
They need a detailed action plan beyond the generalities of wanting a democratic Syria . ''
The United Nations says 2,700 people , including 100 children , have been killed in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P6M">six months</TIMEX3> of protests against Assad , whose Alawite minority sect - a Shi'ite offshoot - dominates the mostly Sunni Muslim country of 20 million .
The 46 - year old president , who inherited power from his father in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2000">2000</TIMEX3> , blames the violence on armed gangs backed by foreign forces , while his officials say 700 police and soldiers have been killed , as well as 700 ` ` mutineers . ''
The government has dismissed the opposition organizing outside Syria as a foreign conspiracy to sow sectarian strife .
The state news agency said ` ` armed terrorist groups '' killed five members of the security police in the Ghab region west of the city of Hama and used explosives to derail a freight train in the province of Idlib <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2011-10-02">Sunday</TIMEX3> .
It also said that Sariya Hassoun , the son of Mufti Ahmad Hassaoun , who is officially considered the highest religious authority in Syria , was assassinated in Idlib .
Idlib , together with the central region around the town of Rastan on the Orontes River , 110 miles north of Damascus , have seen some of the biggest protests against Assad , followed by a fierce crackdown and fighting between loyalist forces and defectors and other insurgents .
The two regions are a main reservoir of Sunni recruits to the military , which is led by mostly Alawite officers .
Local activists said troops backed by tanks raided villages and towns looking for army defectors around Rastan <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2011-10-02">Sunday</TIMEX3> , with tens of villagers arrested in the Houla and Talbiseh region , and the villages of al - Zafaran and Deir al - Foul .
One activist said security forces killed three civilians on <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2011-10-02">Sunday</TIMEX3> in the town of Khan Sheikhoun north of Rastan .
He said that among them was activist Mohammad Tellawi , 35 , whose brother Mukhles was also killed <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2011-07">three months ago</TIMEX3> .
ISLAMISTS , SECULARISTS , CHRISTIANS AND KURDS
The Istanbul declaration was read out by Bourhan Ghalioun , a secular professor of politics living in France .
He was flanked by Islamists , including Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohammad Riad al - Shaqfa , Christian and Kurdish politicians and Samir Nashar , a member of the Damascus Declaration .
Among those represented in the Damascus Declaration are former parliamentarian Riad Seif , seen as possibly playing a leadership role if Assad were to fall , and Riad al - Turk , Syria 's top dissident .
Turk , 81 , but still operating underground , has moral authority over the diverse opposition , having spent <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DURATION" value="P25Y">25 years</TIMEX3> in jail as a political prisoner , including almost 18 in solitary confinement .
France has already publicly supported the National Council , but it has not yet won endorsement from the United States or Syria 's powerful neighbor Turkey , which has been enraged by what it describes as brutal killings south of its border .
Assad has relied on Russia and China , which have major oil concessions in Syria and do not want to see Western influence in the Middle East spread , to block western proposals for United Nations Security Council sanctions on Damascus .
The European members of the Security Council have been working in <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent days</TIMEX3> to persuade Russia to accept a watered - down resolution on Syria that would threaten ` ` targeted measures '' against Damascus if it fails to end its crackdown on pro - democracy demonstrators without explicitly threatening U.N. sanctions , Council diplomats said .
European envoys say that they hope the Council will vote on the Syria resolution <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2011-10-04">Tuesday</TIMEX3> .
