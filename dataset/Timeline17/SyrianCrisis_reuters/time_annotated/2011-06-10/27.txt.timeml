A pro - Syrian President Bashar al - Assad supporter , who rallied to a Facebook call to sit - in to support the army at Arnous square , carries his picture in Damascus <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2011-06-07">June 7 , 2011</TIMEX3> , after the Syrian troops with tanks moved on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2011-06-07">Tuesday</TIMEX3> towards Jisr al - Shughour town , where the government has vowed to quell a revolt after accusing gunmen of killing scores of security men .

Reuters -RRB- - Fears that Syria may slide into civil war are growing after <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="P1W">a week</TIMEX3> when the government said over 120 servicemen were killed at a town near the Turkish border .
As it sent tanks on <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2011-06-10">Friday</TIMEX3> into Jisr al - Shughour , a mainly Sunni Muslim town whose 50,000 inhabitants had mostly fled , the cause of <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2011-W22-WE">last weekend</TIMEX3> 's bloodshed was still in dispute -- state media blamed unidentified gunmen but democracy activists said troops mutinied after refusing to fire on unarmed demonstrators .
Whatever the truth , the killings suggest either cracks within President Bashar al - Assad 's security forces or the beginnings of an armed revolt -- or some combination of the two .
Either way , the scale of the killing in an area prone to tension between Syria 's Sunni majority and Assad 's Alawite sect points to a bloodier turn of events after <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DURATION" value="P3M">three months</TIMEX3> of unrest against <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="P41Y">41 years</TIMEX3> of Alawite - dominated Assad family rule .
That in turn would rock the entire Middle East , where Syria , Iran 's main Arab ally , sits at the heart of numerous conflicts .
` ` The country is sliding toward civil war .
It is a step toward civil war , '' said Syria expert Joshua Landis , associate professor of Middle East studies at Oklahoma University .
He noted that the poor area around Jisr al - Shughour , lying at the foot of the ` ` Alawite Mountain , '' the heartland of the dominant minority sect , was home to conservative Sunni Muslims .
Many Syrians who joined the Sunni Islamist insurgency in Iraq against U.S. forces came from that region , he added .
` ` It 's got a history of anti - government agitations , '' Landis said .
` ` The Islamic currents are very strong there . ''
In <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="1980">1980</TIMEX3> , the late Hafez al - Assad , who preceded his son as president , crushed a Sunni revolt in Jisr al - Shughour , which lies on a strategically important road between Syria 's second city Aleppo and the main Mediterranean port of Latakia .
<TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="1982">Two years later</TIMEX3> , Assad 's forces put down an armed uprising in Hama by the Sunni Islamist Muslim Brotherhood , killing many thousands and razing the old town -- an event which still resonates for Syrians considering challenging their rulers .
Those who have taken a lead in demonstrating for reforms , inspired by the Tunisian and Egyptian protests which launched the Arab <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2011-SP">Spring</TIMEX3> , stress their insistence on non - violent action .
Few are willing to speak publicly about taking up arms .
And some dismiss talk of sectarian and ethnic violence as scaremongering by Assad loyalists intent on keeping power .
However , in conversations <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2011-W23">this week</TIMEX3> with a number of Syrian activists , several said they believed some of Assad 's opponents were already using weapons , including arms smuggled from abroad .
` ` Some people have taken up arms against the security forces in Jisr al - Shughour .
We know that , '' said one activist who , like many , would speak on the subject only on condition of anonymity .
` ` The question is : Is this limited ?
Or is it going to spread to other cities ? ''
After years of repression , it is hard to establish the strength in Syria of organised movements like the Muslim Brotherhood , let alone of other anti - government groups .
As in several other towns , residents in Jisr al - Shughour have accused Alawite militiamen , known as shabiha and fiercely loyal to the Assads , of helping the security forces .
Two activists said armed Sunni men , as well as shabiha groups , had set up rival sets of checkpoints on roads -- an echo of the kind of sectarian tension familiar from neighboring Lebanon and Iraq .
Guns are widely available across Syria .
` ` People have taken arms , '' Landis at Oklahoma University said .
` ` Things are about to get a lot worse than we thought . ''
Louay Hussein , an activist in Damascus , said he did not know of Sunnis taking up arms in the northwest of the country .
But he told Reuters from the capital : ` ` We have warned the authorities from the beginning that the excessive use of violence will , in the end , allow armed groups to use violence against them . ''
Assad has responded to protests , which began in the southern Sunni town of Deraa , by offering discussions on reform but also by sending in security forces to detain and kill demonstrators .
The government insists it is willing to listen but rejects Western pressure for radical changes .
It points out Syria has a potentially volatile mix of ethnic and religious communities , including Christians and Kurds , as well as Sunnis and Alawites .
` ` Syria is a mosaic , '' Syrian government spokeswoman Reem Haddad told Al Jazeera <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2011-W23">this week</TIMEX3> .
` ` It is made of many different sects living together . ''
Many in the Christian and Alawite minorities say they support reforms , but fear that calls for the overthrow of Assad could fragment the country of 20 million and hand it over to hardline Sunni Islamists who would persecute other religions .
Assad 's initial response to the protests has included steps toward reforms , including granting citizenship to some ethnic Kurds , lifting a draconian state of emergency , freeing hundreds of prisoners and calling for a national dialogue .
Protests , triggered by anger and frustration at corruption , poverty and lack of freedoms , have been mainly peaceful , though rights groups say the death toll among protesters is over 1,100 .
At least 200 security personnel have also been killed , the government says .
Activists say that at least some of the dead soldiers were killed for disobeying orders to stop protests .
Syria has expelled Reuters correspondents and barred most foreign media , preventing independent reporting from Syria .
Fayez Sara , an opposition figure who was detained earlier in the uprising , said he still has hopes that a political solution might save the country from descending into chaos .
` ` We should try till the last minute because otherwise the price tag will be high , '' he told Reuters from Damascus .
` ` When we say the time has ran out for a political solution , this means we are opening the country to civil war . ''
Western powers and their Arab allies have voiced concern but show no appetite for Libya - style intervention in Syria .
The gravity of the situation particularly alarms some across the border in Lebanon , where officials with ties to Syria privately express concern that some areas may be headed for chaos .

A Lebanese analyst , who is close to some opposition figures in Syria , said : ` ` We have been warning our Syrian brothers but they do not want to listen .
They think the civil war in Lebanon and in Iraq will not reach them .
They are wrong . ''
The possibility of splits in the armed forces , where the top command ranks and elite units are largely Alawite while the mass of conscripts are Sunni , is also a concern .
A Damascus based analyst , echoing many observers abroad , said Assad and his Alawite allies appeared bent on hanging to power at all costs : ` ` The regime has essentially vowed to break the country over the people 's heads , '' the analyst said .
` ` It will push the country over the cliff unless Syrian society resists its divisive tactics .
So the fate of Syria lies not in the hands of the regime , but in that of the people . ''
An activist who took part in an opposition conference in Turkey <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2011-W22">last week</TIMEX3> said he believed that widespread violence was a risk many were willing to take , however , to be rid of Assad .
` ` Even if there is ... a civil war or anything like that , people are determined to go all the way , to the end , regardless of the cost , '' he said .
` ` We want him out and we want to be free of this regime .
` ` The regime is pushing the country toward civil war and we are heading that way it seems . ''

That would be bad for the other Muslim sects , Kurds and the Christians .
It appears to me the desire to be free is greater than a desire to embrace a Sunni based religious dictatorship .
In the end , all of this might have to be settled by a civil war .
If that happens , the US needs to back the moderates in the country .
Otherwise , there could be big trouble in the region .
Journalists are supposed to be neutral .
The report reveals the reporter 's blatant bias .
This reporter has an agenda .
` ` Guns are widely available across Syria '' .
Syrians would crack up if they heard such misinformation .
To get a pistol , you would have to know the right people , bribe VERY generously , and wait for months .
Some might also be able to smuggle small pieces but that would be EXTREMELY difficult .
People in Syria have no access to weapons whatsoever .
Enraged by the massacre that occurred on <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="2011-06-04">June 4th</TIMEX3> in Jisr el - Shughour , Lieutenant Colonel Husain Harmoush , Division Command , the 11th Division , defected along with a number of other members of the military .
They refused to gun down unarmed protesters and stood up to the regime .
Get your facts straight before you say that ` ` Guns are widely available ACROSS Syria ''
like it was Yemen .
I am sure you have a lot of Syrian contacts .
Please pose this question to them about the readily availability of guns in Syria and thy will laugh their heads off .
Both Assad and Gaddafi are brutal dictators who fire on their own people .
Why UN and NATO adopt double standards toward Syria and Libya ?
These cold - blooded leaders deserve bunker bombs .
